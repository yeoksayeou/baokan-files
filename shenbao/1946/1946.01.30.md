### Zhou Enlai and Others Expected to Arrive in Chongqing Today; Negotiation Conference Postponed to Close Tomorrow; National Assembly Group Still in Session

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi departed from Yan'an at 10:00 AM today, but due to weather conditions, they landed in Xi'an. They are expected to arrive in Chongqing at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 30th.

[Another dispatch] CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi have not yet returned to Chongqing today. As a result, the Political Consultation Conference did not hold a general meeting today and has decided to extend the session for another two days, until the 31st, when it will close.

[Another dispatch] The National Assembly Sub-Committee of the Political Consultation Conference held continuous meetings on the morning of the 29th, but failed to reach an agreement. A meeting is scheduled for the afternoon of the 30th to continue negotiations.

[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] Discussions at the Political Consultation Conference regarding the reorganization of the government and the organization of the National Assembly remained deadlocked today. The government proposed adding several ministers without portfolio to the Executive Yuan, with seven or eight positions given to other parties or non-partisans. The CCP and the Democratic League both opposed this, arguing that members of other parties should occupy half of the ministerial positions in the government. Meanwhile, a representative of the Democratic League today proposed to the National Assembly Organization Committee that representatives elected before the war, if openly identified as Kuomintang representatives, could retain their seats, which the Democratic League would not oppose.

[Another dispatch] After 15 days of consultation, the Political Consultation Conference has reached a broad agreement today. Observers acknowledge that the Kuomintang has made the following two major concessions: (1) reducing the power of the President; (2) agreeing to transfer the power to appoint and dismiss members of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee to the State Council, which will become a national institution with 20 seats for the Kuomintang and 20 seats for other parties and non-partisans. This resolution is currently being compiled by the Executive Committee for formal adoption by the conference. The main points are as follows: (1) The government will reduce its army to 90 divisions within six months. (2) The CCP will reduce its army to 20 divisions within three months. (3) The President's extraordinary powers must be approved by the State Council before implementation. (4) The decisions of the President can be overruled by a two-thirds majority vote in the State Council. Meanwhile, the Constitution Drafting Committee has completed its work and passed important resolutions as follows: (1) The Legislative Yuan will be renamed the House of Representatives. (2) The Control Yuan will be renamed the Senate. (3) The Executive Yuan will be responsible to the House of Representatives.

### Political Consultative Conference to Nominate 35 Representatives; Organizing Constitution Drafting Committee; Yan'an Holds All-Night Meeting to Agree on Amendments

[United Press, Yan'an, 28th] After Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi returned from Chongqing with a report on the resolutions of the Political Consultation Conference, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong and other CCP leaders convened a meeting of the Party Central Committee last night, which lasted all night and adjourned this morning. It is understood that they have expressed agreement with the constitutional amendment, but still oppose the majority of the National Assembly representatives being appointed by the Kuomintang and the convening date of May 5th. Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi told the United Press separately that the Political Consultation Conference will nominate 35 representatives to organize a Constitution Drafting Committee and propose seven major amendments. Among these representatives, the Kuomintang, Communist Party, Democratic League, and Youth Party will each have five members, non-party figures will have five members, and the Legislative Yuan will have ten members. A meeting will be convened in a few weeks to propose the following important amendments to the current draft constitution:

(1) Stipulate a Bill of Rights to guarantee all freedoms of the people without restriction.

(2) Establish a bicameral legislature, with the Control Yuan as the upper house and the Legislative Yuan as the lower house, with the lower house being the sole body to propose legislation.

(3) Based on the American state system, implement provincial autonomy, and formulate provincial constitutions, provided that they do not conflict with the national constitution. The boundaries and number of the existing 28 provinces may be changed, and the governors will be elected by the provinces themselves.

(4) Reorganize the military. The current Military Affairs Commission, which stands parallel to the Executive Yuan, will be subordinate to the Executive Yuan. A National Defense Committee will be established under the Military Affairs Commission, with the participation of all parties and factions, to form a new national army.

(5) Stipulate a completely new democratic election system.

(6) Stipulate broad economic and cultural policies.

(7) Establish a presidential and vice-presidential system, with both the president and vice-president being elected.

After the constitutional amendments are completed, they will be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion on May 5th and must be approved by four-fifths of the members to be established. Although the Communist Party opposes the National Assembly, in which Kuomintang representatives hold the vast majority, the party will accept it if the number of Communist Party representatives can account for more than one-fifth. If the National Assembly attempts to propose a constitution that violates the above seven principles, the Communist Party can use this number of representatives to veto it. After the Constitution Drafting Committee is formed, it will separate from the Political Consultation Conference and meet independently, and only when it reaches a deadlock will the Political Consultation Conference come forward to resolve the dispute. There is deep satisfaction here with the progress of the situation. According to Zhou Enlai, "Everything is going smoothly, and the Political Consultation Conference is moving towards success. The freedom of the people will be guaranteed." When Lu and Zhou arrived here, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and other CCP leaders welcomed them at the airport, and their enthusiastic emotions were obvious.

### Soviet Troops Withdraw from Southern Shenyang; New Sixth Army Completes Landing at Qinhuangdao

[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] According to Changchun sources: The Soviet troops in the south of Shenyang will all withdraw by the end of the month. The Soviet troops in the north of the city cannot complete the withdrawal by February 1st due to transportation difficulties.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 29th] According to Chinese sources here: Soviet troops have withdrawn from a small town 20 miles south of Shenyang. Therefore, the hope that the National Army can enter Shenyang earlier has suddenly increased. Sources here revealed: The Soviet attitude towards the National Army is now more cooperative than before, so the Soviet Union may hand over these areas in a short period of time, and said: The Soviet troops have also withdrawn from other locations outside Shenyang, but there is no news of withdrawal from Shenyang itself. At the same time, the New Sixth Army has landed in Qinhuangdao, thereby enhancing the military strength of General Du Yuming's troops preparing to take over the Northeast.

[United Press, Tianjin, 29th] It is reported that Soviet troops have withdrawn from two small villages south of Shenyang, but the Soviet troops in the city remain unmoved, and it is still uncertain when the National Army will enter the city. At the same time, whether the National Army has recovered Yingkou has not been officially announced.

### Respect People's Basic Freedoms, Abolish and Amend Relevant Laws: Supreme National Defense Council Decides on Four Categories of Handling

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] The Supreme National Defense Council met at 10:00 AM on the 28th, chaired by Committee Member Sun Ke. It passed Chairman Chiang's proposal to abolish and amend current laws concerning the freedom of person, belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association. After detailed discussion, it was determined that the abolition and amendment of laws related to the basic freedoms of the people could be handled in four categories: (A) Laws that have already been explicitly abolished need not be abolished again. (B) Laws proposed for abolition can be handled in two parts: (1) Those promulgated by the National Government should be explicitly abolished by the National Government. (2) Those promulgated by agencies such as ministries and commissions should be ordered to be abolished by the respective agencies themselves. (C) Laws that should be amended can be sent to the legislative body for revision. (D) Laws formulated by provinces, counties, cities, and security agencies themselves, or those that have been submitted to higher authorities for record but conflict with central laws related to the basic freedoms of the people, should be abolished altogether. Except for laws that have already been abolished and will not be listed again, the laws that have been decided to be abolished and the laws that have been decided to be amended are listed separately below:

(A) Regulations to be Abolished

(I) Pertaining to Personal Freedom: Part One, to be explicitly abolished by the National Government: (1) Measures for Safeguarding Personal Freedom and their Implementation Regulations. As the Habeas Corpus Act can be implemented regularly, and the Criminal Procedure Law already has provisions in Articles 208 to 210 regarding the agencies authorized to execute arrests, the Measures for Safeguarding Personal Freedom were a transitional measure before the implementation of the Habeas Corpus Act and can be abolished when the Habeas Corpus Act is implemented. (2) Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. As all provisions of this law are already covered in the chapters on internal rebellion and foreign aggression in the Criminal Code, if the penalties stipulated in the Criminal Code are deemed too lenient, the Legislative Yuan can revise them. The Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China should be abolished. (3) Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Order. (4) Outline of Measures for Preventing the Activities of Traitors and Spies. (5) Continued Implementation Measures for the General Investigation of the Seven Rear Provinces including Shaanxi and Hubei. (6) Precautionary Law. The Precautionary Law was promulgated in the third year of the Republic of China (1914) and has been used until now, but it has no practical effect and should be abolished. (7) Unified Inspection Measures for Water and Land Transportation. (8) Implementation Rules for Unified Inspection of Water and Land Transportation. (9) Implementation Rules for Unified Inspection of Civil Air Transportation. (10) Service Regulations for Air Station Inspection Stations. The unified inspection of water, land and air transport (7)-(10) were established to meet the needs of wartime. The original intention was to prevent the transportation of opium and other contraband, which is understandable, but as the undertaking has ended, they should be abolished. (11) National General Mobilization Law. (12) Provisional Regulations for Punishing Those Who Hinder National General Mobilization. The above two laws and regulations were formulated to meet the needs of wartime, and their work is dispersed among various government agencies. Some matters may not be concluded immediately, and a gradual abolition approach should be adopted. Part Two, to be abolished by the original promulgating agency: (1) Measures for Restricting the Consumption Movement. (2) Measures for Suppressing Extravagant Behavior During Wartime. (3) Measures for Controlling Manpower. The above three measures have lost their purpose and should be abolished by the original promulgating agencies.

(II) Pertaining to Speech and Publication: Part One, to be explicitly abolished by the National Government: (1) Wartime Publication Censorship Measures and Prohibited Content Standards. (2) Wartime Book and Periodical Review Regulations. (3) Provisional Regulations for Accompanying Military Reporters and Photographers. (4) Outline of Cultural Mobilization Plan. (5) Bookstore Management Regulations. (6) Script Publication and Performance Review and Supervision Measures. Now that the Measures for Abolishing Publication Censorship have been issued to relevant agencies for compliance, the above review and restriction regulations should be abolished altogether. Part Two, to be abolished by the original promulgating agency: (1) Unified Review Measures for Military Books, Magazines, and Publications. (2) Review Measures for Military Agencies, Schools, Troops, and Military Publications. Now that the publication censorship system has been abolished, the above two measures should be abolished by the original promulgating agencies. (3) Detailed Rules for Implementing Postal Inspection.

(III) Pertaining to Assembly and Association: Part One, to be explicitly abolished by the National Government: (1) Measures for Suppressing Assemblies and Speeches During Extraordinary Times. The Measures for Suppressing Assemblies and Speeches During Extraordinary Times were formulated to cope with the War of Resistance, and there is no need for them to exist now that the war has ended. (2) Law on Surrender of Communists. This law is no longer applicable and should be abolished. (3) Outline for the Organization of People's Organizations During Extraordinary Times. Part Two, to be abolished by the original promulgating agency: (1) Measures for Dispatching Clerks to Professional Organizations. (2) Measures for Strengthening the Control of Industrial and Commercial Organizations. (3) Control Plan for Agriculture and Industry in Important Counties and Cities of Sichuan Province. (4) Rules for Meetings of People's Organizations. (5) Measures for Reorganizing People's Organizations. (6) Measures for Training Members of People's Organizations. (7) Measures for Unifying Social Movements During Extraordinary Times. (8) Measures for Unifying Public Training. (9) Training Outline for People's Organizations During Extraordinary Times. (10) Measures for Party and Government Agencies to Supervise People's Organizations During Extraordinary Times. (11) Oath Rules for Directors and Supervisors of People's Organizations Taking Office. The above eleven regulations have either become ineffective due to the end of the War of Resistance, or the situation has changed and they are no longer needed, and should be abolished by the original promulgating agencies.

(B) Regulations to be Amended

(I) Pertaining to Personal Freedom: (1) Instruction No. 370 of the National Government, July 11, 27th year of the Republic of China (1938). The content of this instruction from the National Government is that during the War of Resistance, soldiers who committed crimes other than military law would be temporarily handled in accordance with the Army, Navy, and Air Force Trial Law. Although the War of Resistance has ended, it is still necessary to maintain it for the sake of ensuring the effectiveness of the law for soldiers and military dependents. However, the wording should be revised to read "Soldiers and military dependents who commit crimes other than military law may be temporarily handled in accordance with the Army, Navy, and Air Force Trial Law." (2) Rules for Protective Custody. To be revised by the Ministries of Interior and Justice in accordance with Articles 92 and 93 of the Criminal Code and submitted for discussion. (3) Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Crimes. Since the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations came into effect in November of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), except for a portion of opium and drug cases in the Sichuan-Kangding area, which are still under the jurisdiction of military law organs for ordinary people, all other criminal cases have been transferred from military law organs to ordinary courts for trial. Therefore, they should all be transferred to ordinary courts for trial.

(II) Pertaining to Speech and Publication: (1) Publication Law and Implementation Rules. The Supreme National Defense Council has established five amendment principles for the Publication Law and its Implementation Rules. The Ministry of Interior has also drafted six additional amendment opinions based on the principles. After the Ministry of Interior completes the amendments, they can be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. (2) Provisional Measures for Managing Newspapers, News Agencies, Magazines, Movies, and Broadcasting in Recovered Areas. Except for the part dealing with the handling of industries that formerly belonged to the enemy, puppets, and those who collaborated with them, which should be formulated separately by the Ministries of Interior and Propaganda, the rest of these measures should be abolished entirely, and the name should also be changed. (3) Measures for Abolishing the Publication Censorship System. According to Article 2 of the Measures for Abolishing the Publication Censorship System, news censorship is abolished in all areas except military martial law zones, and the scope of military martial law zones is determined by the Military Affairs Commission (recovered areas and areas where rehabilitation work has not yet been completed should be regarded as military martial law areas). The provisions of Article 2 are inconsistent with the current situation and should be abolished. (4) Provisional Regulations for Film Censorship Offices During Extraordinary Times. Film and drama censorship exists in all democratic countries and can continue to be carried out, but it must be amended.

(III) Pertaining to Assembly and Association: (1) Law on the Organization of People's Organizations During Extraordinary Times. (2) Revised Plan for the Organization of People's Organizations. (3) Measures for Compulsory Membership and Restriction of Withdrawal from Professional Organizations During Extraordinary Times. Regulations for the organization of people's organizations exist in all countries. Some of the above regulations are impractical and should be revised by the competent authorities and submitted to the legislative body for amendment.

The entry of supplies into the city was prohibited, and all food and drink became a problem. The repair of the railway between Xuzhou and Yanzhou is expected to be very difficult due to a lack of materials and coal for the locomotives. Also, the damage is more serious than between Tai'an and Yanzhou. Colonel Leck and others have agreed that the Communist army will return the dismantled rails, sleepers, screws, etc. for use. Even so, it may still be difficult to achieve the desired result. The Jinan Group will determine its next move after Colonel Leck returns to Jinan from Beiping on the 28th.

### Iranian Representative Receives Instructions to Negotiate a Settlement with the Soviet Union; UN Secretary-General to be Appointed in Geneva Shortly

[United Press, London, 29th] Soviet and Iranian representatives are expected to meet today to discuss ways to settle the dispute. Prior to this, Iranian Prime Minister Sadana instructed the Iranian representative to the UN General Assembly to negotiate with Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky in order to reach an agreement. According to speculation among delegates to the General Assembly, the new Iranian government, known for its closeness to the Soviet Union, may agree to Vyshinsky's proposal to ask the UN Security Council to postpone discussions on the Iranian-Soviet dispute pending direct negotiations between the two sides. At the same time, an agreement on the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations is expected to be reached within 24 hours. After the Secretary-General is elected, the only major organizational issue for the General Assembly is the selection of a permanent headquarters. The headquarters survey team has been surveying sites near New York and Boston and is expected to submit a report on the second day of next month for the UN General Assembly to decide.

[This newspaper] According to a London broadcast on the 29th, after the Iranian delegation received instructions to begin direct negotiations with the Soviet Union, Soviet representative Vyshinsky or other representatives may formally suggest that the Security Council cease consideration of the Iranian affair. As for the British point of view, it is believed that the Security Council should be notified of the results of direct negotiations at any time, and therefore should continue to maintain its responsibilities.

[This newspaper] According to a London broadcast on the 29th, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie has been recommended as the Secretary-General of the United Nations at an informal meeting of the Security Council today.

[This newspaper] According to a London broadcast on the 29th, in a meeting of the UN Agency Committee, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico and Bolivia declared that more obligations should be fulfilled to the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Representative Bloom rose and delivered a speech, tearfully, saying in moving tones, "We must save people's lives, not just think about it, but also take action. Everyone has their own children, and we must give them food and clothing so that they are warm and fed. If the relief work is left to next year, these many children will no longer exist." The whole room applauded. Subsequently, representatives from Bolivia, Mexico, Brazil, and Uruguay spoke successively, expressing their support for the proposal. It was agreed that the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's mission should be completed by the end of this year in Europe and by the end of next year in the Far East, and it was proposed that a committee be organized to consult with countries that have signed the UNRRA agreement to urge them to donate as much as possible, and to invite UN member states that have not signed the agreement to work together. This proposal was unanimously adopted. The Security Council may hold an informal meeting within days to consider the UN Secretary-General issue.

### Most Tense Scene in the Security Council: Listening to Arguments from Both Iran and the Soviet Union

[United Press, London, 28th] The UN Security Council today heard its first international political dispute case involving national sovereignty. Iranian Ambassador to Britain, Tajiqizadeh, told the Council that the Soviet authorities have repeatedly interfered in Iranian affairs and should be prevented from continuing such actions, and made four specific requests: (1) The Council should recommend strict adherence to the troop withdrawal conditions stipulated in the 1942 Treaty with the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet authorities should no longer take actions in Iran that violate the Tehran Declaration of the Big Three (US, UK, and USSR). (3) Soviet troops must not impede Iran's independence and sovereignty. (4) The Soviet Union should withdraw all spiritual and material assistance to the rebellion in Azerbaijan Province. Tajiqizadeh also said that Iran is eager to improve relations with the Soviet Union. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky said that this accusation was made by the former Iranian government, and the Council has no sufficient reason to interfere in this matter and should shelve it and wait for the parties to negotiate a solution. Such a disposition would be fair and just and in line with the spirit of good neighborliness. The Soviet Union is willing to maintain friendly relations with all countries, and the Soviet government has never refused to negotiate with Tehran on difficult issues in Iran. According to the UN Charter, the first method for resolving international disputes should be to use this method, so the Council can do without consultants in this case. It is too early to say that the parties cannot resolve it on their own. The one refusing to continue negotiations is Iran, not the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has always been prepared to continue negotiations with Iran. It is reported that Tajiqizadeh is the chief representative of Iran. Iran's first complaint to the Council was made on the instructions of former Prime Minister Hakimi. Hakimi has resigned and Sadana has succeeded him. Sadana declared that he would negotiate directly with the Soviet Union and said that he had issued instructions to the delegation, but there was no announcement of the new instructions from the Iranian officialdom. The Council adjourned without making a decision on the case and will discuss it again on Wednesday.

### Greek Foreign Affairs Committee Issues Declaration Defending the Presence of British Troops

[Reuters, London, 29th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin attended the meeting yesterday with a large file in preparation for making a statement, but did not get the opportunity. It is not known whether there will be new developments before Wednesday's Council meeting to change the current course of the case. Vyshinsky's use of procedural issues as his defense is an interesting contrast to Foreign Secretary Bevin's invitation to the United Nations to conduct a full investigation into the issues of Greece and Indonesia. The next action on the Greek case cannot be predicted until it is included on the Council's agenda. Greece released two documents yesterday. One was a speech by Greek Foreign Minister Sophianopoulos before leaving Athens for London, explaining the Greek government's attitude towards the presence of British troops in Greece, and also denying rumors that he disagreed with the government on the matter. The other document was a statement by the Greek Foreign Affairs Committee, which is mostly composed of former prime ministers, stating that Greece should declare to the United Nations that its domestic politics are purely a matter for Greece and does not want them to become a cause of disputes between the United Nations. The statement said that the presence of British troops in Greece was requested by successive Greek governments and is in complete accordance with its wishes.

### Work of the United Nations Conference Enters Concrete Stage; Expected to Conclude in the Middle of Next Month

[Central News Agency, London, 28th Special Dispatch] Since its opening on the 10th, this week will be one of the busiest for the United Nations. In addition to continuing to convene subcommittees, the three important institutions of the UN organization - the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Economic and Social Council - will hold two plenary sessions during the first four days of this week. Although the scope of work of the various subcommittees established by the UN General Assembly is not comparable to that of the Security Council, it has entered a concrete stage as of today. The important issues that the General Assembly intends to resolve this week include: (A) Using appropriate methods to accelerate the establishment of the Trusteeship System. (B) Regarding refugees from the Second World War, whether to adopt the suggestion of the British delegation to handle them under the responsibility of the United Nations, or to adopt the proposal of the Soviet delegation to handle them in accordance with the methods agreed upon by the current governments. (C) Measures for the UN financial budget. (D) Regarding the official language issue, whether to adopt the proposal of Spanish-speaking countries to use five languages as the common languages of the General Assembly, or to continue to use the English and French languages that have been used since the San Francisco Conference. Other less important issues that also need to reach a final agreement include (1) the scope of diplomatic privileges and immunities for UN officials, staff, and delegations, (2) the treatment and salaries of judges of the International Court of Justice, (3) the determination of the permanent location of the United Nations in the United States, (4) the establishment of an agreement between the US government and the United Nations on the partial internationalization of the permanent address, and (5) the civil service system and staff recruitment of the United Nations Secretariat.

[Reuters, London, 29th] The work of the UN Agency Committees is not slowed by the convening of the Security Council. Yesterday, the Trusteeship Committee had nine proposed amendments to the term "countries directly related to the Trust Territory" submitted, and it was decided to refer them to a subcommittee for processing. The work of the UN committees is progressing smoothly, and the first half of this General Assembly is expected to end on February 13, and will continue to meet in the United States in April.

### Our Country Continues to Purchase American Cotton to Revive the Textile Industry

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th Special Dispatch] The New York Commercial Daily said: In addition to several ships of American cotton currently being loaded for Shanghai, China plans to continue to purchase 333,000 bales of American cotton to meet its needs and revive the textile industry. According to a detailed investigation by the Bureau of Domestic and Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Commerce, the revival of the Chinese textile industry has been slower than expected due to organizational difficulties and a shortage of electricity, technicians, and cotton. The existing cotton in Shanghai, even if all factories are working, is not enough for a month's use, so the activities of the various textile factories depend on the import of foreign cotton. According to statistics from November of last year, there were a total of 2,301,906 spindles in Chinese and Japanese textile factories in Shanghai, but only 150,000 spindles were operating. It was originally expected that 500,000 spindles could be operating by the end of last year, and another 1 million spindles could be added to production by August of this year, aided by political and economic developments and increased cotton supply. The total cotton production in China this season is 1.5 million bales, a decrease of nearly 1 million bales compared to pre-war levels. And most of it is spun by cotton farmers themselves, so the textile factories can only obtain at most 440,000 bales. The total amount of foreign cotton that China has imported and contracted to import, including UNRRA supplies, is 600,000 bales, but China's demand for foreign cotton this season is 600,000 bales, and most of the imports depend on the United States, although the demand for American cotton is already very high in the United States, Britain, and Italy. The supply of silk in Shanghai is still comparable to pre-war levels, but the supply of wool is extremely short due to the interruption of supplies for four years.

### US Shipping to the Far East to Resume in Early March

The old China National Aviation Corporation has been dissolved. Pan American's 45% stake in the company was sold in December of last year. Pan American World Airways has agreed to provide technical assistance and management consulting to the new China National Aviation Corporation for a period of five years, which may be extended for another five years.

### Yukio Ozaki States the Japanese Emperor is Not Divine

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 29th] Yukio Ozaki, an 88-year-old Japanese veteran who has been a member of the House of Representatives for 55 years, recently stated that the Japanese Emperor is not divine, as even the most foolish person knows. As for whether the imperial system should be retained, it has not yet been decided. Ozaki once gave a heated speech in parliament in 1942, the details of which are still unknown. At that time, he was convicted of treason but was eventually released due to his age. In the last parliament, Ozaki suggested that the name of the Japanese ruler should be changed, which was tantamount to demanding the Emperor's abdication, an unprecedented move. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor exceptionally granted him an audience, which lasted 45 minutes. After that, Ozaki announced that he was hesitant on this issue, but at the same time, he telegraphed Nozaki, the leader of the Communist Party, who had stayed in China for a long time and had only recently returned to the country, urging him to come. At first, Nozaki advocated for the complete abolition of the emperor system, but later agreed to a compromise, suggesting that the people decide the fate of the imperial family. Ozaki said that he could not use it as guidance.

### US Representative to the Far East Commission to Return Home This Friday

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] The US representative to the Far East Commission prepared to leave Japan and return to the US on Friday, and this morning made a special visit to General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, to bid farewell.

### US Senator Advocates Convening a World Disarmament Conference to Prevent Future Atomic Warfare

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Democratic Senator Stednis proposed in the Senate today that President Truman convene a world disarmament conference immediately to prevent a world atomic war. Whether the United Nations organization's "control" of atomic bombs can succeed is highly questionable. With the existing powers of the United Nations organization, it is doubtful that it can carry out such a difficult task. Since Germany and Japan have already been prohibited from military equipment, the main purpose of the United States maintaining a large army is obviously to deal with the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China in the future. On the other hand, it is also clear that the Soviet Union's maintenance of a large army will be used to deal with Britain, France, and China in the future.

An Indonesian leader said that Dutch forces have received notification to prepare for a "showdown" in April. The change of Allied commanders and the fact that Sir Cole will be commissioned to the Dutch East Indies has raised Indonesian questions, namely, "Is this move intended to change the policy towards us?" Dutch sources said that they believe Van Mook's suggestions will be accepted by the Indonesians, but the date of the actual meeting between Van Mook and Shahrir has not yet been decided.

[Further Telegram] Dutch East Indies Lieutenant Governor Van Mook is expected to host reporters today to announce the methods for the next negotiation with Indonesian leaders. The Indonesian side has appointed Dr. Salim as an advisor to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Officials announced yesterday that the situation in Batavia has improved, and the curfew time, which originally started at 10 pm every night, will now be changed to start at 11 pm every night. According to the Dutch News Agency, Indonesian Prime Minister Shahrir said yesterday that no one has contacted him for negotiations since Vice Governor Van Mook returned to Java. Shahrir also said that after the departure of Allied Commander-in-Chief General Christison, he hopes that his replacement can have a fair attitude.

### A New French Political Party Emerges to Confront the Three-Party Coalition; Gouin Will Announce His Policy to the Assembly

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The French Constituent Assembly is scheduled to meet today to hear the procedures of the new Gouin government. At the same time, large banners have appeared in Paris and major provincial cities announcing the formation of a new conservative party, calling itself the "Republican Freedom Party," which is the first attempt to establish an organized opposition party to confront the coalition of the French Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Progressive Catholic Party. During the elections last October, right-wing groups won a total of 53 seats out of 522 total seats, and until now their work has remained somewhat independent. It is widely believed that Reynaud, the Prime Minister when France collapsed in 1940, has a close relationship with the formation of this new party. The new party's主張 is: a strong executive government that is not subject to foreign pressure, freedom of the press and production, fair social treatment for workers, and the proper handling of industrial and agricultural equipment. The party's banners accuse the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Progressive Catholic Party of "monopolizing power" and causing the country to "verge on bankruptcy." Before the new government's meeting in the Constituent Assembly today, Gouin has been consulting with various ministers, and it is expected that Gouin will encounter some difficulties in seeking the support of various parties for the implementation of its specific measures, which have so far only been approved in principle.

### Britain Plans to Send Personnel to Observe Atomic Bomb Tests

[Associated Press, London, 28th] Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that when the United States tests the power of atomic bombs on warships in the Pacific in May, the United Kingdom will send several military observers to the scene to observe. One member asked, "What kind of ownership do we still have in terms of atomic bombs?" Attlee replied, "This is a completely different question."

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] Rear Admiral Bowen, director of the US Naval Research Laboratory, said today that after ten years of experimentation in this atomic age, the United States may be able to create a new navy, which may even be very different from the current one in appearance. With the help of science and industry, this research institute will study all attacking forces on land and water. The research objectives are as follows: (1) Using atomic energy to propel ships, (2) Methods for preventing atomic bombs, (3) Improving methods for producing atomic materials, (4) Exploring the scientific changes of missiles and the super-speed of aircraft.

Minister of State Peake said that this matter should be negotiated directly between the Soviet and Danish governments. Savery continued, stating that not only Denmark, but even the rest of the Scandinavian countries, are saddened by the violation of Danish neutrality, and that this matter seems very urgent. Should it be submitted to the United Nations Security Council?

### Nazi Crimes Beyond Number; Cremation and Scattering Ashes as Fertilizer; Forcing Prisoners to be Executioners

[Central News Agency, Nuremberg, 28th (Special Telegram)] Two French witnesses today recounted previously unreleased facts about Nazi concentration camps at the war crimes trial. Dr. DuPont, a French prisoner who was held for 15 months in the notorious Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar, told the court that the Germans used the ashes from the crematorium as fertilizer for nearby wheat fields. Prisoners in the Buchenwald concentration camp were not only forced to go to the execution grounds to witness the hangings of other prisoners in the camp, but were even sometimes forced to serve as executioners. Prisoners in the German army camps were forced to donate blood to the German blood bank. Prisoners who were physically capable of labor were sent to the ordnance factories near Buchenwald to serve as coolies. However, when they were no longer useful due to insufficient nutrition and weakened physical strength, they were sent to Zone 61 to await death, which was the death zone. Mrs. Hafen, a Communist Party member of the former French Constituent Assembly, reported on the situation in the Auschwitz and Ravensbrück concentration camps where she had been detained.

Singapore has experienced several labor unrests in the past four months, but this is the first time that employees hired by private homes, military institutions, cafes, and hotels have also stopped working. It is generally believed that this labor unrest will develop into a test of strength between the union and the military government, and the military government holds strong weapons, namely, it can use a large number of Japanese laborers to carry out all important tasks if necessary. The strike may continue for some time, and no strike date has been set.

### A Savage World Where Beheading is a Skill: Random Tales of Strange Customs - US Air Force's Exploration After Discovering the Grand Valley in Ifitamin – Translated by Our Editorial Department from the December Issue of National Geographic

The natives of Ifitamin are another type. They consider beheading neighboring tribes a skill, but they are quite friendly to Caucasians. Shortly after our airlift troops arrived in Ifitamin, they willingly helped us dig waterways, move stones, and build runways. Soon after, we began landing twin-engine aircraft, and gradually our supplies, personnel, transport planes, etc., could all take off and land there. Thus, Ifitamin became one of the Air Force's crucial emergency bases.

### Pygmies Live in Mud Houses: No Furniture on Bamboo Floors

The Ifitamin people are very short and dark-skinned. Their houses are mostly square, with thick thatched roofs and bamboo floors, unlike the snow houses of the Grand Valley Eskimos. The entrance is small, about three feet above the ground. Once, I entered a native's house and slipped on the bamboo floor as soon as I stepped inside. There were no tables, chairs, beds, bedding, or any furniture, not even a baby's cradle. Only a pile of stones was in the corner, emitting smoke and various vegetables piled on the ground.

### Cooking on Stone Piles: The Thatched Roof is Black with Smoke

With me was a major from the Australian army who had lived on the island for a long time and had contact with various tribes. He pulled a celery-like stalk burning on the stone pile from the ashes. It was well-baked, and after peeling off the outer skin, we started tasting it. The flavor was similar to sorghum grains. The roof was black with soot, and it seemed to need a chimney. The smoke escaped in the same way as in the Grand Valley, through the thatched roof.

In another house, we saw a woman holding a newborn infant, completely naked and unwashed. In the same house, there were three other women holding piglets, holding them just like babies, which was quite amusing.

The Australian major told me that pigs are very important in New Guinea because they are one of the main foods for the natives.

The missionary told me that in 1941, the natives in a village in Tanahmerah captured a hundred human heads. They had not set out to hunt for heads in four years, so no newly married couples had been formed in the village for four years. After capturing a hundred heads this time, they all got wives. It truly was "no head, no wife!"

The marriage customs and rituals are very strange. The bride must take things out to buy, and the groom goes to the bride's parents' house and pays with various types of shells and dog teeth, and the deal is done.

### Babies Never Bathed: Afraid of Rain

Several families live in the same small hut, men sleeping and eating together, and women and children together. If a couple needs privacy, they must leave the house and go into the jungle. Single men and women are not allowed to have relations. Married men can have several wives, and they all have to live together.

In some tribes, the women take care of themselves during childbirth. In other tribes, other women may assist. There is a special small hut for childbirth. The child born is never bathed. The natives do not like water at all. They are even afraid of rain.

### Strange Wedding: Bride Must Raise Both Arms

During the wedding ceremony, the whole village gathers around the fire. The brides line up in a row, raising their arms high, facing the grooms. Each groom places a human head he has hunted into the bride's hand. The person presiding over the group wedding is often the strongest person in the village, the one with the highest record of headhunting. Incest, such as a father marrying his daughter, a son marrying his mother, or a brother marrying his sister, is forbidden. Courtship and wooing are not allowed, but secret courtship does occur from time to time.

### Twins Forbidden: The Second and Third Are Killed

Women of the Tanahmerah tribe cannot have twins or triplets. Otherwise, except for the firstborn child, the second and third are all killed. The natives believe that the second or third child is the reincarnation of a demon. Men can have multiple wives, but women cannot have multiple husbands. Husbands can divorce their wives, but wives cannot divorce their husbands. This does not apply to mutually agreed divorces. Men who have not hunted human heads can only marry divorced women and cannot marry unmarried women.

### Warriors of Ifitamin, Northeast New Guinea

The double thorns on the warrior's nostrils in the picture are imitating the antennae of insects (crickets). The shells on the head and the pig tusk necklace are valuable ornaments. During the New Guinea War, the US military built a runway in Ifitamin. The Grand Valley was discovered two hundred miles northwest of here, in Dutch New Guinea.

### Human Flesh Eaten as Food: Human Heads as Wedding Rings

The severed head, with skin and bones, is dried in the wind and then used as an ornament by the headhunter—the possessor of the head. The corpse is roasted over the fire, and the whole village, old and young, men and women, feasts on it, eating the roasted corpse to their heart's content!

Headhunting usually takes place at dawn because they believe this is when humans are weakest. Natives are not allowed to marry during this period unless they can offer two hunted heads to the bride, similar to giving a ring.

### Women Bear the Brunt of Labor: Otherwise, Heads are in Danger

In addition to shell ornaments, women only wear something woven from fig leaves, tied around the waist with grapevines. Old women are all weak. Their average lifespan is only forty years. Felling trees and transporting food are all done by these old women. The major said that almost all the labor here is borne by women. Men are only responsible for warfare. If a man carries wood or food, his female companions will be beheaded. Therefore, he has to let women do the labor so he can be ready to fight at any time. The women of Ifitamin are the most hardworking, but only in this way can they protect their heads!

### Headhunting Natives: Spears and Arrows Pierce Their Bodies

A missionary in the Dutch Tanahmerah penal colony told me that the headhunting season is always during the dry season, usually from July to December. The entire village goes out to participate in headhunting, for at least two weeks. During this period, women are responsible for cooking. The person killed is first pierced all over with spears and arrows, and then their head is cut off with a sharp piece of bamboo.

After a man who has hunted human heads dies, his body is placed in a small boat, twenty-five feet above the ground, placed in a suitable location near the village until the body decomposes. The head can be removed, but another head must be placed to replace it. Women are treated in the same way after death. Children who die are buried in bamboo boxes.

### Savage Tall: Different from Other Tribes

The natives of the Grand Valley are neither as friendly nor as unfriendly as we had imagined. They always maintain a respectful distance from Caucasians. They are happy to provide food to Caucasians. Their height is not as tall as we initially estimated from the air. But they are indeed taller than other tribes in New Guinea, and their skin is lighter. They have a unique language, very different from the dialects of other tribes. The natives of New Guinea are called "Curly Hairs," especially the Melanesians of Port Moresby and the east. The natives of the Grand Valley are another type of "Curly Hair." Very few people have straight hair, like the red Indians of America, lying smoothly on their heads.

They have a unique culture, and the style of the buildings seems quite good. The villages are arranged in an orderly manner, and the highly developed agriculture and industry all show the consistency of their unique culture.

### When Natives Die Suddenly: The Whole Village Relocates

Where the husband runs, the wife must follow. If the husband is a porter, the wife follows as a porter. The natives of Tanahmerah like sago, yams, and the roots of certain plants. They are not particularly interested in beef or biscuits. If two residents in the village die suddenly at the same time, the residents of the entire village will relocate. Their weapons are black, hard wooden bows, bamboo arrows, and tips wrapped in tough wooden thorns or bayonets.

The three place names, Grand Valley, Ifitamin, and Tanahmerah, are firmly etched in my memory. I have now returned to my home country (referring to the United States. Editor's note). I long to revisit the old place and go to New Guinea again, especially to travel to the Grand Valley and do some exploration and excavation work.

Should we bring our civilization to the happy residents of the paradise in the Grand Valley? Or should we forget them and let them live without outside interference? Let them cultivate their fields, climbing to the high mountain areas to cultivate, and live and die there as before?—That is a question. (The End. By Colonel Elsmore)

### A Suspension Bridge Built by Native "Engineers"

This bridge is 150 feet long, using grapevine trunks as the basic material and stone axes as tools. The bridge piles and wooden frames are all extremely solid and ingenious. Members of the Archbold expedition witnessed twenty natives crossing this bridge at the same time, which shows its strength.

### Mao Zedong's Wife, Lan Ping, Suffering from Dental Disease: Will Go to Chongqing for Treatment

The Communist leader Mao Zedong's wife, Ms. Lan Ping, is planning to fly to Chongqing. She is currently suffering from a dental disease, and her lower gums are ulcerated. Yan'an does not have suitable treatment facilities, so she is thinking of going to Chongqing for medical treatment. If realized, this will be her first time in Chongqing in eight years.

Ye Ting's Daughter to Accompany

Accompanying her will be the daughter of New Fourth Army Commander Ye Ting, who is only eleven years old this year. Ye Ting is currently in Chongqing and may regain his freedom after Chairman Chiang announces the release of political prisoners. Her daughter is very beautiful, with dark, shining eyes. She lived with her father in prison for three years and only recently returned to Yan'an. Her two older brothers are still in Chongqing.

Hopes to Meet Madame Chiang

Lan Ping was once a famous movie star. After arriving in Chongqing, will she meet with Madame Chiang? Someone asked her this question. She smiled and replied, "I hope so."

Lan Ping joined the Communist Party in 1933 and came to the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in Yan'an in 1937. Mao Zedong was very fond of drama, so they had many opportunities to get close, and love developed. (Note: During the Mao-Lan love affair, the youth in Yan'an rose up in opposition, almost forming a great uproar. This tide subsided after considerable explanation.—Editor.) They married in 1939 and now have a six-year-old daughter with a rosy face.

Has a Car

She has been in Yan'an for eight years, but she has never had the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful things that ordinary women do. They had an official car, donated by the Chinese Laundry Alliance in New York, which was originally a half-ton delivery truck with large patches of paint peeling off. This car can also be used as an ambulance.

Cannot Find Cosmetics

The stores in Yan'an cannot be compared to the large stores on Fifth Avenue in New York, let alone the most rudimentary stores in other parts of China. Cosmetics cannot be found there at all. What is displayed are the daily necessities of life: buttons, thread, cotton cloth, hardware, coarse wool, bed sheets, saddles, and a few leather clothes.

The women of Yan'an wear thick cotton pants or dream of having a black satin dress with cotton trim, but they never see this beautiful clothing except in Peking opera. Wearing high heels will attract attention and be treated as a novelty. Here, people often wear felt or black canvas casual shoes.

Women Become Modern

Few women in Yan'an wear long hair. If someone spends a lot of time combing their hair every day like old-fashioned women, people will be surprised. The women of Yan'an are very lovely and modern. Most women believe that cutting their hair is a necessity because short hair is a symbol of freedom.

Although they have no rouge, powder, or lipstick, they can still dress charmingly, as beautiful as Mao Zedong's wife, Lan Ping. They also often dance, like Westerners, and have their own unique straightforward style (Written by Roderick, Yan'an).

A Plea from Salt-Feng Refugee Youth

The Disaster in Northern Jiangsu

To the Editor: Before the war, the schools in Salt-Feng County were numerous and produced many talented people, worthy of being called the cultural center of Northern Jiangsu. Since the spring of the twenty-seventh year, the enemy bandits have been harassing, and the villages have been reduced to ruins by artillery fire. In the autumn of the twenty-ninth year, the New Fourth Army advanced from eastern Anhui and established a base in Salt-Feng, promoting Communist policies. In the autumn of the thirtieth year, the enemy puppets invaded Northern Jiangsu again, using the slogan of anti-Communist cleansing to wantonly burn and kill. Wherever the sweeping went, the people's wealth was completely emptied! The ten days of Yangzhou may not have been worse than this!

Suffering Hardship

Since the tyranny was subdued and victory came, the people were overjoyed at the convening of the political agreement, privately hoping that they would see the light of day again and that peace would be permanent. But before the talks were concluded, conflict suddenly arose. The National Army was receiving surrender, and was obstructed everywhere. The Communist army, which prides itself on democracy, not only has no intention of uniting and cooperating and giving up weapons to comply with the essential principle of nationalizing the army, but also has established the "Soviet-Anhui Border Region Government" to pursue its separatist policy. In a time of extreme economic hardship for the people, it doubled the land tax and promoted class struggle, creating a psychology of suspicion and hatred among the people. People's speech, thought, and even actions cannot be free. Recently, amid the government's restoration, it ignored the people's feelings and extensively forced conscription, prohibiting all those between the ages of fifteen and forty-five from leaving the country. Their intention is nothing more than to seize political power and create internal strife. Then the people of Salt-Feng, who have endured hardship for eight years, have not been able to find peace, and their suffering has deepened. This is the most unbearable and the most difficult situation!

The Refugee Experience

We young people have been educated. We think of the importance of national restoration and the trend of popular will. Regardless of party affiliation, we do not want to see the national situation fall into an irretrievable danger. We have fled to Shanghai one after another, hoping to preserve ourselves to serve the government's nation-building efforts. While we were on the road, in a small boat, hiding and traveling at night, we lived on only one meal a day. If we encountered wind and rain, we could not even get this one meal. When tired, more than a dozen people huddled in a cramped cabin. When the boat reached a town, we did not dare to go ashore for fear of being discovered, which would endanger our lives. It took more than half a month to reach the paradise of our dreams.

Current Situation

According to recent statistics, there are already fifty-eight young people from our hometown who have fled to Shanghai. Because it is difficult to communicate information and difficult to investigate, there may be more in other places. The number of people on the way is still increasing. We have been in Shanghai for varying lengths of time, some for thirty or forty days, and some for more than ten days. We have no solutions for food, lodging, or employment. Some have already been penniless, without food or shelter, without relatives, and without any way to borrow money. Some have no cotton clothes, no blankets at night, shivering in the cold wind, wandering the streets all day, weeping bitterly, wanting to return but unable to, begging but not allowed. In this situation, it is almost a dead end. We, as educated young people with strong physical strength, cannot but rely on the assistance of righteous people in society. Therefore, we have jointly registered the exact number of people and jointly appealed to all sectors for urgent sympathetic assistance, food and lodging, and job referrals before we are allowed to return home. Signed by the representatives of the Salt-Feng Refugee Youth: Ji Nian-Ting, Tang Yuan-Fang, Chen Liu-Jiang, Ji Mu-Shu, Liu Shou-Yu, et al.

### The Voice of a Small Employee

— Shen Shi

We are a group of small employees, we are a large group scattered in all strata of society, we are a pitiful low-wage class who ekes out a living; we are exhausting our greatest efforts and physical strength, and the rewards we get are the lowest and the treatment is the most severe.

To be clear: we know that the salaries of small employees in major factories, companies, stores, and firms in Shanghai are still around ten thousand yuan, and some are even still between three and five thousand yuan. We have struggled in an environment of hunger and cold for eight years, and most of the capitalists can be said to have made a fortune out of the national crisis in these eight years. We expected that with victory, those who made a fortune out of the national crisis would eventually be liquidated, and that the difficult lives of us small employees would eventually improve; but we did not expect that after victory, those nouveau riches made even more money, adding victory money to the national crisis money; and us small employees, not only have not improved, but have become even more bitter. Everyone knows that since victory, prices have risen ten to twenty times to date, but our salaries, although repeatedly adjusted, are actually only in name. For example, the salary increases in a certain large factory: the stated rates of increase sound good, five percent, one time, two times, and they have been adjusted several times. But because we originally had low salaries, even if we add one or two times to them, the amount we get is still only a small amount of seven or eight thousand yuan. Moreover, the increase was forced when prices had already risen to an unsustainable level. As for themselves—the managers and factory directors—their salaries were originally high, and then they added a high percentage, resulting in a large increase. Therefore, the difference between the highest manager and the lowest employee is as high as one hundred and fifty times, which some people may not believe when they hear it.

Recently, the labor strikes in major companies seem to be quite lively, but we can say that there will be no side effects. These are all struggles for life, the voices of desperation. You think, how can we ordinary people who earn five or six thousand yuan to ten thousand yuan a month survive?

Amidst this wave of labor strikes, we hope that the Social Affairs Bureau will establish a "Salary Adjustment Management Committee" to quickly stipulate the minimum standard salary amount, which must be able to maintain our minimum living standards as the principle, and must force all factories, stores, companies, and firms to implement it. Otherwise, the bosses will never think of adjusting it automatically. Otherwise, if this continues, then there will be endless cases of "embezzlement and corruption," and labor strikes will be endless, and society will never have a quiet day. As Guan Zhong said, "When the granary is full, people know etiquette, and when they have enough food and clothing, they know honor and disgrace." How many truly so-called "die of starvation is a small matter" pure and honest men can there be?

### Glimpses of Contemporary Figures

Blanford

Recently appointed by President Truman to assist the Chinese government in reforming its budget system, Blanford is an administrative expert. He first gained national attention as the manager of the Tennessee Valley Authority from 1933 to 1939. In 1939, President Roosevelt brought him to Washington to serve as Director of the Budget Bureau. When President Roosevelt appointed Blanford as Housing Administrator in 1942, he described him as a "young man with extraordinary administrative ability." In this role, Blanford oversaw a program that solved the housing problems of four million wartime workers and their families. Over the past two years, he has laid the foundation for the nation's largest housing program. Born in New York City on August 19, 1897, Blanford received an honorary doctorate in engineering from Stephens College in 1945. During World War I, he served in the Naval Aviation Corps. Blanford was one of President Roosevelt's key administrative personnel during the war. After President Truman took office, he retained his original position. The White House announced on January 26 that Blanford would soon go to China to assist the National Government in reforming its budget. President Truman appointed Wyatt to succeed Blanford as Housing Administrator. (Washington)

Vincent

Director of the Far Eastern Division of the U.S. State Department, and the most influential advisor to Secretary of State Byrnes on Chinese affairs. Ambassador Hurley's resentment of Vincent dates back to his time in China. Vincent served as a counselor when Gauss was the ambassador to China. After Hurley arrived in China, Gauss resigned immediately, but Vincent continued to work, and his position rose even higher, as he was appointed by Byrnes as Director of the Far Eastern Division. Hurley now has to accept his directives. (Translated from the December 10th issue of "Time")

Patterson

The recently visiting Secretary of the Army, age fifty-five, is a lawyer by profession. In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed him as Under Secretary of War while he was still a federal circuit judge. During the war, he was responsible for supervising military production. He succeeded Stimson as Secretary of War last October. Recently, during the intense debate between the U.S. Army and Navy over whether to establish a unified military department for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, he and Marshall advocated for the same position, suggesting that Congress establish a unified military organization. (Translated from "Time")

Editorial

### Looking at the World from Within

In recent days, the evolution of the international situation and the development of our domestic situation have presented a very interesting contrast. The members of the Political Consultative Conference are gathered in the capital, attempting through consultation and coordination to enable China to achieve peace and stability and engage in the establishment of a new order. However, despite these efforts, even with explicit cease-fire orders, the organization of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, the central government's utmost concessions, and the government organization being opened as much as possible, the situation in the Consultative Conference and in various regions still seems to be unclear, with many subtle and obscure points. Just seeing that the chief representative of the Communist Party, Zhou Enlai, had to go to Yan'an for instructions during the conference, and that the conference was repeatedly extended, indicates that there are many twists and turns ahead. These situations bear a striking resemblance to the unfolding of the recent international situation. The first session of the United Nations General Assembly is gathered in the British capital, aiming to establish a new stable order for the world. However, while the representatives of the United Nations are discussing in London, the situation in various parts of the world remains subtle and obscure. Opening the newspaper, the pages present many thought-provoking headlines. If one does not think about them, they can be ignored, but if one pays a little attention, one finds them full of meaning. Let's take a few examples. In recent days, we have seen the following headlines in the newspapers: "Syria and Lebanon demand the withdrawal of British and French troops and issue an appeal to the world"; "The separatist movement in Iran has spread to Iraq"; "The relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union is abnormally tense"; "The atmosphere in the Security Council is tense"; "British troops remain stationed in Java and Greece, and the Soviet representative sternly criticizes them, aiming to retaliate against Iran's complaint"; "Iranian representative accuses the Soviet Union of violating the agreement"; "Nine U.S. groups advocate the liberation of dominated nations"; "London mass rally demands independence for India," and so on. If we connect these headlines together, we cannot help but have many feelings. I would like to make a few comments at this moment.

The most noteworthy international event in recent days is probably the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the establishment of an Atomic Energy Commission. This commission was unanimously agreed upon on the 24th by representatives of 47 countries attending the United Nations General Assembly, which is a new awakening of mankind to the coming of the atomic age. Originally, since the U.S. military dropped two atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the control of atomic energy has been an important issue in the meetings of the heads of major United Nations. The proposal to establish an Atomic Energy Commission within the United Nations framework, as agreed upon at the Three Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow, has now been unanimously adopted at the United Nations General Assembly. The tasks that this commission will undertake have not yet been announced in detail, but according to Reuters, the commission will "internationalize the secrets of atomic energy"; and that it will "deal with various issues and related matters arising from the discovery of atomic energy." We deeply hope that with the establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission, the use of atomic energy can improve human welfare, rather than lead mankind to destruction.

The establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission is indeed a reflection of international coordination. However, while representatives of various countries are trying to coordinate in London, the situation in various parts of the world may not be coordinated. The Iranian issue, the Dutch East Indies issue, and the Near East and Balkan issues are quite serious. Regarding the Iranian issue, since the beginning of the Axis war, Iran has been ruled by British and Soviet troops dividing the territory. Although it has a nominal independence, everything must be subject to the whims of the British and Soviet military authorities. After the victory and the end of the war against the Axis powers, the northwestern part of Iran saw the semi-independent movement of Azerbaijan, which actually established an autonomous government and declared its separation from Iran. The Azerbaijan region was originally within the zone occupied by Soviet troops, and the Soviet Transcaucasus also has an Azerbaijani polity. This semi-independent movement does not seem to be a purely spontaneous local event. The Iranian Prime Minister wanted to negotiate with the Soviet Union but could not, which led to his resignation. Although it cannot be said that the Soviet Union is related to the coup in Azerbaijan, it is regrettable that such an event occurred in its military zone.

If it is believed that because there are Azerbaijanis within the territory of the Soviet Union, the Azerbaijanis in Iran must be independent, autonomous, or affiliated with the Azerbaijani Soviet Union, this will be an extremely dangerous principle. In the future, because Poland has Ukrainians, it must give up the residence of Ukrainians to Ukraine; Czechoslovakia has Russians, so the Russians of Czechoslovakia must merge with Soviet Belarus, which is a well-known example. The same request has also been made to Turkey and rejected. If this principle is widely adopted, it will affect the stability of world order. According to reports, the separatist movement taking place in Iran has recently spread to Iraq. The Kurdish people of Iraq have sent a delegation to report, requesting the establishment of autonomous governments and other reforms in various regions and villages, and stating that if their demands are not accepted, the Kurdish people of Iraq will formally establish relations with the Kurdish Liberation Committee in the Soviet-controlled area of northwestern Iran. It can be seen that this movement is spreading. After the Iranian government was unable to negotiate with the Soviet Union, it submitted the Azerbaijan incident to the United Nations for handling. The Security Council has included it on the agenda, allowing the Iranian representative to state his case, but it is said that the discussion will be postponed. This will undoubtedly be a test of the power of the United Nations. Especially when we recall that Hitler's Nazi Germany used the guise of "Germans" when dealing with Czechoslovakia and Poland, it really makes us change color at the mention of it. Therefore, an incident like the one in Iran seems to be a minor matter, but didn't the Shenyang Incident in those days also be regarded as a "local incident"?

The situation in Indonesia in Southeast Asia was originally an act of rebellion in which local natives colluded with Japanese bandits. The deployment of British troops in Java was to carry out the United Nations' work of accepting the surrender of the enemy. The situation in Indonesia has not been clarified because the British military authorities felt that the use of force was not a good plan. Now, the Netherlands and Indonesia are planning to hold negotiations, and the United Kingdom has sent its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Kerr, as a special envoy to the Netherlands East Indies to facilitate these negotiations. With the joint efforts of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, the situation in Indonesia is expected to be resolved in the short term. However, just as the situation in Southeast Asia is gradually improving, the Soviet Union and Ukraine suddenly questioned the United Nations about the situation created by the presence of British troops in Greece and Indonesia, demanding that the United Nations take action. According to London dispatches, the Soviet action can be regarded as a retaliation against Iran's complaint to the Security Council. In the arena of diplomacy, they are fighting each other, while the civilians of the world are all in suspense!

Looking at the world from within the country, the current situation is somewhat similar. No one does not hope that order can be stabilized, and no one does not hope for coordination. However, in the efforts to stabilize order and attempt to coordinate, traces of power politics can be seen everywhere! The failure of military force or power to solve everything and its inevitable failure. In view of the collapse of the Japanese bandits and Hitler, mankind should have a sense of awareness, especially in the current era of using atomic energy. It is a pity that mankind has not yet awakened from the dream of power! The United Nations organization was originally seeking the stability of world order, but at the beginning of its birth, it encountered many threats. Whether it will not follow in the footsteps of the League of Nations, the Iranian issue is a major test. In short, the power concept from which strong power doctrine originates must be fundamentally broken, and all countries must interact on a truly equal footing. Then mankind can have true coordination. Where exactly is the world going? Where exactly is humanity going? Today, it must be decided by human wisdom.

### Xue Yue Meets with Reporters, Says China Should Revive the Countryside, 200,000 Prisoners of War from Hunan and Hubei Will Be Transported to Shanghai

Yesterday, a reporter visited General Xue Yue at his residence. Xue had once come to Shanghai in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), after which he was engaged in suppressing bandits in various places. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the commander of the Ninth War Zone, commanding the battles in Hunan and Hubei. It has been eleven years since he left Shanghai. Now that he has revisited the old place, he is very happy in his heart.

Mechanization of the Countryside to Be Implemented First in North China

Xue said: "This time I came to Shanghai purely to tour the great Shanghai after the victory. I will leave Shanghai soon to return to my post in Wuhan." He also said: "During the eight years of war, the people suffered deeply. China must not have any more wars in the next thirty years to increase the suffering of the people. We should do our best to revive the countryside, first mechanizing the countryside in North China, and then gradually advancing to the south of the Yangtze River. This move must also be assisted by the United States. After the mechanization of the countryside, labor can be reduced and production increased. The lives of our vast farmers can be warmed, and they can be self-sufficient in food, clothing, and housing, so that there will be no more panic. At the same time, national education should be advanced to improve the people's intellectual level. Regarding the problem of army reorganization, Xue said that it must wait for the decision of the highest central authorities. He did not know anything about it, but after the war was over.

The Army Must Be Reduced to Lighten the Burden on the People

The army must be reduced to reduce the burden on the people. He also said: "Changsha is the most important barrier in our War of Resistance. Since the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), there have been major battles in Changsha every year, and the number of casualties on both sides has been enormous. After the Japanese surrender, there are a total of 200,000 prisoners of war in the Ninth War Zone of Hunan and Hubei. They have now been centrally concentrated in separate locations, waiting for orders to be transported to Shanghai and sent back to Japan. However, the date of their repatriation may have to wait until the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in the Beijing and Shanghai areas is completed, and then proceed to Hunan and Hubei."

The National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Transports Farming Machinery

It has also been learned from a responsible person of the NRRA that he told reporters recently: "The purpose of the agricultural rehabilitation plan is to enable farmers who have been damaged by the war to restore production as soon as possible and increase production, so as to reduce the need for relief goods to be imported. There are many main tasks in this plan, and the scope of the plan is even wider, especially the farming machinery urgently needed to restore the countryside. The UNRRA has recently shipped a large number of farming machines from the United States, which have already arrived here and will be unloaded soon to meet the current shortage of agricultural tools in the countryside. However, the means of transportation to send these machines to the interior of our country and the disaster areas are also lacking, so it is temporarily impossible to distribute them universally. They may be tested in the suburbs and countryside first, and the technology for using these farming machines will be taught to farmers at any time."

### Labor Strikes Gradually Calm Down

The labor strikes of Yung An and other nine major companies, after the personal mediation of Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, have all resumed work. Regarding the details of annual bonuses, promotions, and salary increases, the representatives of labor and management continued to negotiate at the Social Affairs Bureau at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The situation was good, and an agreement was reached at 8:00 p.m. The representatives of labor and management signed the agreement in a friendly atmosphere. Regarding other labor strikes, the situation yesterday was as follows: (1) The workers of the Mainland Machinery Factory of the Resources Committee made three demands to the factory. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the labor side was willing to make concessions, and the factory side also expressed sincerity. It is heard that it can be resolved satisfactorily.

### Rice Merchants Are Strictly Prohibited from Raising Prices During the Lunar New Year Holiday; Prices at Yesterday Evening's Closing Should Be the Standard

Today is the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month of the abolished calendar. The Qinglian Pavilion Rice Market will begin to rest according to custom, suspending all transactions, until the fifth day of the lunar new year of the abolished calendar, when it will resume business. At about 6:00 p.m. yesterday, Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Food in Shanghai, fearing that rice merchants and rice shops would take the opportunity to raise rice prices and disrupt the market, affecting the livelihood of citizens, issued an emergency handwritten order, ordering Qu Zhenhua, the standing committee member of the Rice Trade Association, to find a way to notify all rice shops in the city that night that they are absolutely prohibited from raising rice prices arbitrarily during this holiday period, and that the price at the close of the rice market last night should be the standard. If there is a deliberate violation, strict penalties will be imposed after verification.

Unblocking Sources and Issuing Loans

In order to suppress rice prices, the Shanghai Grain Administration Commissioner's Office has decided to issue large-scale loans to rice merchants starting next month. Any formal rice merchant who wants to purchase rice from various places can apply to the office. After the office examines and approves the application, the merchant can obtain a loan with a guarantor, which is about half of the rice merchant's original capital. After obtaining the loan, it can only be used to purchase rice, and a detailed report form must be submitted every ten days, stating the purchase price and the selling price of the rice, so as to avoid speculators manipulating the market and profiting from it. Therefore, the office may send personnel to investigate at any time in order to actively suppress and stabilize rice prices.

### Progress in the Negotiations of the Electricity Labor Strike; Expected Resolution in Re-Discussions This Morning; Representatives of Five Public Utilities Also Attended Yesterday

[Local News] The electricity company labor strike has revealed a glimmer of hope for resolution. Labor and management representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau for negotiations together at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Labor union representatives from the five major public utilities also attended and listened, including Zhang Ziheng from the gas company, Zhang Yikang from the water company, Liang Yongzhang from the telephone company, Zhang Yueliang from the British electricity company, and Zhu Junxin from the French water and electricity company, and over ten other individuals. Over ten representatives from various agencies attended, including Lu Keming and Fang Rusheng from the General Labor Union, Lu Jingshi from the Social Affairs Bureau, Li Kaidi from the Public Utilities Bureau, Shi Weipu from the Garrison Headquarters, and Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Headquarters.

Wu Kaixian Attended to Urge

Zhang Zhenyuan, the chief of the mediation section of the Social Affairs Bureau, served as the chairman. Before the negotiations began, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, came to the venue to deliver a speech, stating that the treatment of the electricity company is already better than that of other commercial firms, hoping that the labor side would not insist on all the conditions, and that the management side should also have the sincerity to accept mediation, make mutual concessions to resolve this dispute. Then, Director Zhang presided over the negotiations, first discussing the focus of this labor strike, the problem of the ten employees dismissed by the company and Shen Han's actions. Ferris, the representative of the management, said: "These ten people were originally temporary workers, and it is only natural to dismiss them after their term expires." Regarding whether Shen Han stole electricity and whether the company's handling was fair, they are willing to submit it to the court for investigation and trial, while Director Zhang said, based on the reports from the labor side and the results of the investigation, that the five people in the second batch of dismissed employees, including Jin Chun-sun, entered the factory on March 15, 1945. At that time, it was agreed to serve for three months, and after being re-ordered for three months, the company took over on September 15. These five people had already reached their term, and the company did not dismiss them, so the new employment relationship had already occurred in fact and should be regarded as temporary workers.

The Company Has Agreed to Reinstate Five People

He also said that according to our country's customs and the current regulations of the Unemployment Workers Relief Committee, all temporary workers who have served for more than three months are regarded as long-term employees. For the above reasons, he requested that the management side reconsider. Ferris immediately stated that he was willing to immediately reinstate these five people. As for the first batch of dismissed temporary employees, including Qu Zengxiang, Director Zhang needs to review their resumes at that time before further discussion. Regarding whether Shen Han had disloyal behavior, the two sides debated fiercely. Representatives from the General Labor Union and other public utility workers also spoke one after another, but the management side still insisted on handing it over to the court for handling. If he is found not guilty, he should still be hired as before, and the wages for the days of the strike can also be paid. At about 5:00 p.m., the labor representatives of the electricity company, Ouyang Zu and Huang Hongxun, left the meeting because the conference was limited to returning to the factory no later than 5:00 p.m., so the meeting ended, and unfinished matters were scheduled to be discussed further at 10:00 a.m. this morning.

All Sectors Hope for a Quick Solution

In other news, the electricity theft case will be handled by the arbitration committee organized by the Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with relevant agencies, and representatives of the court will be invited to participate in the arbitration committee. The salary issue is scheduled to be discussed again at 10:00 a.m. today. It is reported that the electricity labor strike, after Director Wu's best efforts to mediate, is expected to be resolved soon. All sectors of Shanghai hope that the electricity workers will resume work as soon as possible to comfort the hope of the general public.

Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Expresses Its Opinion

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce expressed its opinion on the electricity company labor strike, stating: "The association, in its position as a commercial organization, is very concerned about the electricity company labor strike in this city. Although the workers are working slowly and not stopping the electricity supply, which shows that they are taking into account the public interest of the city, all their negotiations with the management should be handled step by step in accordance with government laws and regulations. Therefore, the association hopes that the electricity workers will avoid the actions of working slowly and striking in public utilities, and may propose reasonable conditions to the management and quickly send representatives to attend the Social Affairs Bureau to proceed with mediation in accordance with the law, so as to avoid prolonged stalemate. The association believes that the labor strikes of the nine major companies have been successfully concluded due to the efforts of the Social Affairs Bureau in mediation. Moreover, electricity is a public utility. If reasonable conditions are proposed, the Public Utilities Bureau will be able to make a fair decision, and the workers need not worry too much."

Letter to Workers from the General Labor Union, etc.

The Shanghai General Labor Union Reorganization Committee and 107 labor unions, including the postal, tobacco, rubber, cotton yarn, shipping, and woodworking unions, recently issued a letter to the electricity company workers, saying: "We, in the position of labor, hope that the workers of your company, in accordance with the legal and reasonable principles, will accept the government's advice. At the same time, we hope that the government authorities will quickly mediate so that the labor strike will not be prolonged and the workers will be spared from suffering. This is our deepest expectation."

### Shanghai Organizations Yesterday Welcome Wu Kaixian; Wu Declares to All Circles "No Money Needed"

[Our Report] Yesterday at 4 PM, more than twenty organizations, including the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Journalists Association of Shanghai, held a tea party at the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association to welcome the newly appointed Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian. Over a hundred people attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaogai, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jiyu, Xi Yushu, Chen Xunyu, Feng Youzhen, Shi Yonggeng, Ju Xuexiang, and Qian Jianqiu. After Wang Xiaolai, as chairman, delivered a brief introductory speech,

Pan's Speech

Pan Gongzhan delivered the first speech, roughly stating that Director Wu is a loyal comrade of our party. His appointment as Director of the Social Affairs Bureau is truly fortunate for Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors and society. Recently, labor strikes have occurred frequently in the city, similar to the situation after the Northern Expedition in 1927. Wu is not afraid of hard work and shoulders heavy responsibilities; such spirit is truly admirable. Based on my past experience, I am willing to offer suggestions to Director Wu. The Social Affairs Bureau itself should have a sound organization and a strong cadre, and it must maintain close contact with the society and citizens. Only then can any difficulties be resolved. Subsequently, Qian Jianqiu, Xu Jiyu, Xi Yushu, Zhou Xuexiang, Feng Youzhen, and others delivered speeches in succession.

Wu's Reply

Finally, Wu stood up and addressed the audience regarding his future tasks, mentioning four points: Having studied in Shanghai for ten years and served for twenty years, Shanghai is no less than a second hometown to him. This time, he was ordered to be the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and he considers himself of limited talent and knowledge. He hopes that seniors from all walks of life will provide more guidance. Over the years, he has firmly believed that public servants should have the spirit of "a military officer not fearing death and a civil officer not needing money." Taking service and sacrifice as the premise is the only way to make national affairs move towards the right track. Therefore, his first principle is to "not need money" and to supervise his subordinates to earnestly achieve this. He hopes that all citizens will supervise and assist him at any time. (Two) Currently, society is uneasy, and labor strikes occur frequently. Such phenomena are inevitable in various countries after the war. However, if this continues, it will hinder the grand plan of national construction. The biggest reason for labor strikes is nothing more than economic conditions. Therefore, he hopes that the industrial and commercial sectors will quickly strive for autonomy and automatically adjust wages. If it is impossible to resolve, the Social Affairs Bureau should impartially mediate so that both labor and management can obtain a solution under reasonable principles. He also hopes that the labor side will not resort to strikes as a means of coercion. (Three) In today's Shanghai, full of wounds and scars, the development of social welfare is also important. He hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will contribute their efforts and money to assist the government in relieving poor compatriots, which can also indirectly stabilize society. (Four) People's organizations are the foundation for implementing democratic politics and should be organized in a sound and tight manner. The Social Affairs Bureau will be in a guiding and assisting position in the future. All overlapping organizations in the past will be adjusted and merged. He asks for understanding and guidance from all sectors in the process.

### Commemorating Roosevelt's Birthday, US Military Holds Dance

Several thousand American soldiers here specially held a grand dance at the American military club this morning to commemorate the birthday of the late American President Roosevelt. At the same time, a "dime donation campaign" was held to welcome all American soldiers in Shanghai to participate with their friends. Roosevelt suffered from hemiplegia during his lifetime, but he still dedicated himself to the great cause and was admired by the people of the United States. Now that it has been almost a year since Roosevelt passed away, American overseas soldiers are taking this opportunity to hold a fundraising campaign to commemorate his great achievements during his lifetime. The funds raised will be used to help patients at the Warm Springs Rehabilitation Hospital in America. This campaign has already begun. General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US Military Headquarters, was the first to respond to the campaign. Yesterday, he took a dime from his pocket at the American military club and put it into the donation box.

The government should follow good advice like a flowing stream, and we hope to be adopted, lingering in anticipation, and await orders. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Association, Shanghai General Labor Union, Shanghai Education Association, Shanghai Farmers Association, Shanghai Women's Association, Shanghai Student Union, respectfully kowtow together. January 28th

### Obvious Crimes of Japanese Military Police; Preliminary Interrogation Has Begun

The former Japanese military police stationed in Shanghai totaled 1,028. During their occupation of Shanghai, these people killed and looted our compatriots, committed adultery and robbery, and committed all kinds of evil deeds. Their crimes are too numerous to count, and the citizens hate them to the bone. The victims have now filed lawsuits with the local procuratorate, the prisoner-of-war management office, and the 23rd regiment of the military police. As of yesterday, the above-mentioned agencies have received more than a hundred complaints, detailing the various illegal acts of the enemy military police during the occupation, which is outrageous to hear.

Glimpses of Crimes

For example, (1) In October 1941, a thirteen-year-old girl named Wang Lianmei was transporting rice near Zhoujiaqiao when she was shot in the right arm by the military police there. She was rescued by the villagers and taken to the hospital, where her right arm was amputated, leaving her disabled. Wang Yunmei is now seventeen and studying at a middle school. She recently went to the military police regiment to cry about her ordeal. (2) Two women surnamed Chen went to the prisoner-of-war management office to complain that their husbands were arrested by the military police years ago and have not been heard from since. It is said that they have been killed. The Chen women requested that the management office send someone to accompany them to identify them. (3) Tang Fohai was arrested in July 1942 near the old fish market for purchasing miscellaneous grains and was severely beaten. At the same time, another arrested person was thrown into the sea and died. (4) Zhang Zhaolin was killed by the Japanese military police because a Japanese military police spy asked him to lead the way to arrest others, and Zhang refused. Now his sister has filed a complaint with the local procuratorate. (5) A Japanese military policeman named Takeda, according to investigations, had harmed more than a dozen compatriots and had applied nitric acid to the thighs of compatriots, causing them to rot, with ten people affected.

Interrogation of Criminals

The 23rd Regiment of the Military Police has now assigned responsible personnel to transfer these heinous criminals and begin preliminary interrogations, so that they can be submitted to a special court for trial in the future. Recently, our side approved a letter from the US military headquarters requesting the extradition of four Japanese military police officers from the concentration camp, including Okawa Moriji郎, Mukoyama Kunichika, Nakatani Yasushi, and Sakai Masashi, to be tried by the US side, because they had harmed US pilots in Shanghai. Among the 1,028 military police officers, there are four majors, forty-seven lieutenants, three hundred and forty non-commissioned officers, five hundred and fifty-three soldiers, and eighty-three military dependents (including twenty-one women and sixty-two men). They are currently detained at the Nisshin Textile Factory in western Shanghai, and the first battalion of the 23rd Regiment is responsible for monitoring and guarding them.

Director's Inspection

Major General Zou Renzhi, Deputy Director of the Prisoner of War Management Office, went to the concentration camp for inspection at 2 PM yesterday. The former Shanghai military police chief, Colonel Yamazaki Naokichi, and the former chief of the special high internal affairs section, Lieutenant Commander Hosokawa Isao, led forty officers and lieutenants to line up to greet him respectfully. After Zou inspected the entire camp, he also gathered the officers and lieutenants to lecture them, earnestly warning them to reflect on the mistakes of the past and make a new start in the future. It was not until 4 PM that it ended.

### Visiting the Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association

—Mu Qing

"We are all old men over fifty years old, but our hearts have not died, and our blood is still hot. When we were young, we shed blood for our motherland, and now we are old."

Mr. Zhang humbly said to the reporter, "For more than 30 years, more than half of the old comrades of the Xinhai Revolution have passed away. The comrades here have been scattered due to the turmoil of the eight-year war, and some have even been reduced to the ends of the earth, in very tragic circumstances. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the national fortune has turned for the better, our Xinhai Revolution comrades are extremely willing to dedicate our last strength to jointly promote the realization of the Three Principles of the People. That's why we want to restore this Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association."

The Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association was first established during the "January 28th Incident," with the aim of jointly overcoming national difficulties. In the winter of 1936, a re-election meeting was convened at 602 Route Cardinal Mercier, and Mr. Zhang was elected as a supervisor. After the July 7th Incident, the comrades were scattered, and the association was also suspended. Now that the country has been restored, Mr. Zhang has restarted the organization and proposed four purposes: (1) to make suggestions to the country, (2) to be fair to society, (3) to help comrades, and (4) to enlighten future generations. So far, more than 30 comrades have registered to participate, and Mr. Qiu Ziji, who co-founded the Tongmenghui with the late Chairman Lin Sen, has also joined. The Shanghai headquarters will be officially established on the first day of the new lunar year, and then it will be promoted to various provinces and counties.

Most of the current members have retired due to old age and only serve in industry, commerce, education, and other fields. However, they have always supported the National Government and adhered to the Three Principles of the People. They feel very pained by the current political chaos. At the same time, they expressed deep concern for the impoverishment of the descendants of revolutionary martyrs such as Li Wencai and Lan Tianwei, who have been reduced to beggars, and are willing to provide assistance as soon as possible. Therefore, they have presented a request to Chairman Chiang to establish a "Revolutionary Comrades' Relatives Education and Training Institute" and have sent letters to Comrade Wu Tiecheng and others for assistance.

"We are old and powerless and can only work from passive matters to make a final effort for the country. We have shed blood when we were young, and now we can only drool. After drooling, everything has to be given to the successors." Mr. Zhang's words were very relaxed, but anyone who hears them will feel very real.

### Li Ze's Case Reported; Procuratorate Files Direct Prosecution with High Court; Suspected of Communicating with the Enemy and Funding the Enemy; Open Trial This Afternoon

[Our Report] The case of Li Ze has been under investigation by the Procuratorate since it was transferred by the High Court on the 10th of this month, lasting for 20 days. Now, the crimes of traitor committed by Li have been confirmed by prosecutors Lin Wopeng and Dai Yunduo. The Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution with the High Court on charges of colluding with the enemy and funding the enemy. The open trial is scheduled for 2:30 PM this afternoon in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court. The plaintiffs, Shu Yueqiao, Han Wucheng, Yao Zhuoren, and Ye Qiubin, will all be summoned. Their lawyer is Sha Qianli, one of the "Seven Gentlemen," and Li Ze's defense lawyer is Senator Chen Tingrui.

Attached is the indictment of the Procuratorate to the High Court:

Defendant Li Ze, 41 years old, a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, residing at No. 7, Miaolong Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. The defendant is the General Manager of the Sun Sun Company on Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and concurrently serves as the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Department Store Trade Association. After the National Army withdrew from Shanghai in the winter of 1937, the defendant successively hired Ito Sanki and Kinoshita Yutaka as consultants to the Sun Sun Company, entrusting them to handle matters relating to contact with the enemy army. In January 1943, the enemy army plundered the main materials of the occupied area

The puppet organization specially established the National Commercial Control Association under the Executive Yuan in Shanghai, with five control committees for grain, cotton, flour, oil, daily necessities, and commodities. The association monopolized the economy of the occupied area and collected and transported important materials such as rice, cotton, and cloth for the enemy army to increase the enemy army's invasion power. At that time, the defendant served as a preparatory member of the association. In March of the same year, after the association was established, he changed to being a director until the victory. Also, in September 1944, the enemy army, due to a lack of steel, widely searched for scrap iron for military use. The defendant handed over a large amount of Sun Sun Company's water pipe iron pipes to the enemy army, which was transported away by military trucks. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the defendant was reported by employees of the company such as Shu Yueqiao. The Shanghai Police Department arrested the defendant on January 7 of this year and transferred him to the Shanghai High Court, which transferred him to this office for investigation.

It is found that the defendant participated in the preparation and organization of the National Commercial Control Association, and then served as a director until the association was dissolved after the victory of the War of Resistance. The defendant has confessed to this during the investigation. The attached documents, news reports, the New China Handbook, and the Continental Yearbook also record the defendant's attendance at the meeting and how the association implemented material control, which can be used as evidence. At the beginning of 1943, the enemy army, in order to enhance its combat power, made every effort to control commerce and plunder materials in the occupied area. The National Commercial Control Association established under the Executive Yuan of the puppet organization was an agency that implemented the enemy army's will and implemented the plunder. In addition to Chinese people serving as directors and supervisors, there were also enemies serving as advisors and section chiefs. The control of essential materials for people's livelihood was particularly strict.

The association has five control committees for grain, cotton, flour, oil, and daily necessities, which directly cooperate with enemy committee members to implement plunder. Therefore, after the establishment of the association, it provided countless materials such as rice, cotton, and cloth to the enemy army and transported and purchased them for them, which was sufficient to enhance the enemy's power, hinder the War of Resistance, and harm people's livelihood. The defendant first participated in the preparation of the association and then served as a director in the important position of the association for more than two years. He should be deemed to have colluded with the enemy to plot against the country and provided and purchased and transported military supplies and food. It is also found that the defendant used Sun Sun Company's water pipe iron pipes to fund the enemy in September 1944. Although the defendant denied this, he argued that he sold them to the Sendai Iron Factory in advance because he was afraid that the enemy army would force them to be taken and the timing was urgent. However, it was found that the enemy army had already been forcibly collecting ironware in order to replenish its war needs, and the puppet organization had also formulated temporary regulations on the movement of wartime materials to restrict the movement of metals. The Sun Sun Company, presided over by the defendant, had an enemy as an advisor, and the defendant wanted to sell a large number of water pipe iron pipes in a calm manner, which was impossible, and he was not afraid of the enemy army discovering and investigating, and dared to compete with the enemy for purchases, which was also very unreasonable. Combined with the unanimous testimony of the company's employees, such as Shu Yueqiao, that it was indeed several enemy soldiers who carried them away in military trucks at the time of the move, the defendant's suspicion of providing the enemy army with raw materials for manufacturing military equipment is also difficult to dispel.

In summary, the defendant has violated Article 2, Paragraph 1, Items 4 and 5 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. According to Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed, and it is requested that a trial be conducted according to law.

### Two Traitors Continued to be Tried Yesterday

The High Court held a collegial panel yesterday to interrogate two traitors: (1) Wu Yimin, who had served as a spy for the enemy military police in eastern Shanghai, guiding the enemy to arrest Yang Jigaodeng of the Jiangnan Training Class of the Loyal and Patriotic Salvation Army. (2) Xu Xing, who was a temporary inspector at the Weizhuang puppet inspection station, had extorted money from villagers under false pretenses. The above two criminals have been identified by the accusers as being accurate. However, during the interrogation, they still used excuses to justify their actions. After the court debate ended, the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 5th of next month.

### Reorganization of Baojia Completed in Three Districts

When Chinese stocks first appeared on the market, there was no stimulus in the environment, and the market was cold. Evergreen Cotton Mill (永紗) hovered around 1700 yuan and the Meiya Company (美亞) around 1200 yuan. Major players began selling gold and buying stocks, which finally sparked a buying frenzy. By noon, Evergreen Cotton Mill rose to 1850 yuan and Meiya to around 1270 yuan. Ultimately, Evergreen Cotton Mill and Meiya each closed about 100 yuan higher than the previous closing price, Xinho (信和) was up 30 yuan. The "Three Small" (三小) Jingfu (景福) slightly exceeded Xinguang (新光), while Qinxing (勤興) was relatively quiet, only rising slightly. Jingfu, however, rose by 10%. Other less popular stocks also made progress. In the afternoon, in the unofficial market, prompted by major players' activities, Evergreen Cotton Mill rose to 1950 yuan and Meiya to around 1350 yuan, but the increase was not widespread.

Foreign stocks, because their operations are less complicated than those of Chinese stocks and because they close earlier, experienced a slight pullback compared to the previous day.

Warehouse receipts ranged from 810,000 to 830,000 yuan, with some activity. Factory operations remained as firm as the previous day, but business was slow. Silk goods alone were sought after, thriving day by day. Meiya bedspreads were sold at 900,000 yuan per hundred. The Great Sincerity (大誠) plaid crepe is in even higher demand, given the proximity of the sales day, with each yard trading at 2,920 yuan. The price of Minsheng brocade remained stable.

### No Change in the Tea Market, Strong Foreign Demand

Recently, export businesses in the city have continued to receive cables from abroad urging them to find ways to export Chinese tea. It is said that a certain tea company plans to ship 1,000 small boxes of black tea to the United States and has applied to the authorities for foreign exchange. As for the tea market situation in recent days, with the end of the year approaching, major players remain unwilling to transfer goods, with only a few scattered individuals making small purchases. Transactions are dwindling, and prices remain unchanged.

### Tricycle Monthly Fees Increase Seventeenfold in Four Months

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Some of the tricycles in the city are owned and operated by the pullers themselves. However, during the enemy-puppet period, the puppet Construction Bureau did not allow these pullers to obtain licenses directly. As a result, some fictitious tricycle companies arose, whose business was to obtain licenses on behalf of people. In reality, they had no assets or parking lots, and collected monthly "business base fees" from the pullers, which had to be paid monthly, otherwise the licenses would be seized, which was extremely strict. The monthly fees collected were 12,000 yuan in puppet currency in August when the Japanese surrendered. In September, they increased to 22,000 yuan. In October, they increased to 300 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to 60,000 yuan in puppet currency. In November, they increased further to 1,000 yuan, equivalent to 200,000 yuan in puppet currency. The pullers can no longer afford this burden and have petitioned the Municipal Government's Public Utility Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau to quickly abolish these companies and reduce the monthly fees to the September rate of 22,000 yuan in puppet currency. The reason being that "business base" is not comparable to goods and should not be subject to such rapid price increases.

### Continuous Rain and the Approaching New Year Cause Rice to Reach New Highs, Flour Exceeds the 5,000 Mark

White glutinous rice also rose by nearly 1,000 yuan. Flour, due to soaring prices inland and active sales in the north, as well as inquiries from Hankou merchants, has reached new highs, exceeding the 5,000 mark. Soybeans also rose by 600-700 yuan. Soybean cakes are firm, and raw peanuts are stable. However, the oil market has experienced a large increase followed by a small correction, with soybean oil falling by over 1,000 yuan and raw oil by slightly over 2,000 yuan.

### Director Qian Yunjie Announces Measures for the Recovery of Education in Hubei Province, Cautious About School Admissions, Lenient Entrance Exams

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Hankou] Qian Yunjie, Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Education, recently announced the following measures for the recovery of education in Hubei Province: Before the war, schools at all levels in the province were concentrated in Wuhan, and during the war, they were relocated to the rear, which prevented the widespread and balanced development of education in all counties. Therefore, at the beginning of the recovery, the province's education facilities plan was formulated to coordinate with political and economic construction and local administrative divisions, and planned measures were taken. Secondly, the province's education recovery plan was formulated based on the plan.

Relocation and Recovery of Colleges and Universities

Currently, the two issues of greatest concern to the public are the relocation and recovery of provincial colleges and universities in the rear and the entrance exams for students in the recovered areas. There are a total of 42 units of colleges and universities to be relocated and recovered, which will be done in three phases. The first phase will begin during the winter break, and the subsequent phases will be moved one after another. The Department has issued notices regarding the journey, security, and supplies during the relocation, as well as the leadership and supervision of students, ordering them to be implemented earnestly, and dispatched personnel to Yichang and the Shiyi Highway to take care of them. The travel expenses of faculty, staff, and their families will be paid according to the standards for the relocation expenses of government employees and workers of the provincial government, based on the distance of the journey. According to the central government's instructions, students' travel expenses should be borne by themselves. However, it was found that most students in the rear are from poor families and are unable to raise the funds themselves due to the long distance. Therefore, the provincial government approved the government to provide travel expenses and stipulated that travel by car and ship should be the principle, and each school will purchase and distribute tickets at half price from the local transportation authorities. The provincial government has approved the allocation of 100 million yuan for the relocation expenses of the first phase of each school. However, at this time of year, it is midwinter, the water is shallow and the shoals are dangerous, and the Bayi air route is facing transportation difficulties. The Shiyi Highway is also blocked by ice and snow. For safety reasons, each school has been instructed to carefully handle the situation. As for the school buildings and facilities of each college and university after relocation to the original site, they have long been destroyed by the enemy and puppets. Considering only the provincial schools, social education institutions, and private secondary schools and above, the estimated loss is approximately 190 billion yuan. Most of the remaining school buildings are damaged and have been requisitioned by troops. The provincial government has approved the allocation of 100 million yuan for the repair and equipment of the first phase of each school and has requested the troops stationed in each school to move out as soon as possible for major repairs.

Entrance Exams for Students

There are 2,500 registered students and out-of-school youths from schools in the recovered areas. The Department and the two temporary middle schools in Wuchang and Hanyang have conducted separate entrance exams in accordance with the Ministry's orders. The standards for grade placement and admission are lenient. For example, the Wuchang Temporary Middle School has promoted students with excellent entrance exam scores by one semester, and the Hanyang Temporary Middle School has admitted all students who participated in the first entrance exam. However, many students taking the exam have poor grades. In order to take care of the students' future studies, they will be demoted to a corresponding grade according to their level. In order to provide universal relief, the Department has requested the Ministry of Education to assign the registered high school graduates to preparatory classes for universities and the registered normal school graduates to teacher training classes. At the same time, it has requested the provincial government to establish a tutoring class for middle school students in the Wuhan area so that out-of-school youths in the recovered areas have the opportunity to study or take supplementary courses. After the tutoring period, they will be examined and graded, and then assigned to public and private middle schools. All of these are urgent tasks for the current education system, and it is hoped that the public will provide more assistance to complete them as soon as possible.

### The Cause and Consequences of the Qingdao Student Movement, Fei Xiaozhi is Suddenly Shot and Killed, the Student Movement Expands, Jiao Mojun is Arrested and Imprisoned, the People are Delighted

[Special Report from This Newspaper, Qingdao] The Qingdao student movement, which started with the甄審 (examination and selection), expanded due to the Fei case, and ended with the arrest of the female traitor Jiao Mojun, has shocked the whole country. The month-long student movement has subsided silently. Wang Meisheng, the principal of Chongde Middle School, and Jiao Mojun, the principal of Wende Girls' Middle School, were mouthpieces for the enemy and willingly enslaved people during the occupation. Now that the country has been recovered, the Bureau of Education has replaced them all. Teachers and staff in the schools were uneasy, fearing that they would starve to death before they could be examined and selected and passively resigned. Students demanded that the Bureau of Education retain the faculty and staff and address the examination and selection issues, but received no satisfactory response.

The Background of the Fei Case

On the night of December 16th of last year, slogans were posted all over the streets in the name of the Student and Faculty Association. At about 10 o'clock, Fei Xiaozhi, an English teacher at Wende Girls' Middle School, was suddenly shot and killed, and the student movement expanded as a result. At the time, Fei was not dead and was sent to the hospital for examination in an Allied vehicle. She died from excessive bleeding due to a ruptured bladder. The Joint Military and Police Inspection Office took the Security Team soldier who fired the gun, Wang Yuming, and five others, as well as two police officers who were at the scene, into custody. After three court hearings, Wang admitted to accidentally firing the gun and has been sent to court for trial. Now that the perpetrator has been apprehended and the case has been clarified, the trial was originally scheduled for the 14th of this month. Unexpectedly, on that day, middle school students from all over the city marched in formation to the city government gate, kneeling and crying, making improper and unreasonable slogans. If it were not for the instigation of traitors behind the scenes, how could students have taken such an extreme action? Mayor Li came forward to give a speech, but the students did not disperse. They pushed forward several representatives to see Director Meng of the Education Bureau. The Director explained each issue one by one, and the funeral of Fei was not held until the 19th. The authorities have learned that the female traitor Jiao Mojun was secretly instigating the student movement. Moreover, the deceased Fei Xiaozhi was her own daughter. She refused to hold a funeral for her daughter, but instead incited the students to make unreasonable demands.

Jiao's Arrest

On the 24th, Jiao was resolutely arrested, and a large amount of evidence was seized. Jiao Mojun published an article titled "The Attitude of Decisive Battle in Education" on December 16, 1944, in the puppet newspaper 大新民報 (Daxinmin Daily), extensively publicizing for the enemy and puppets. On July 28, 1943, she published a speech titled "We Should Understand the Friendly Support of the Allies, Work Hard to Strengthen Ourselves and Complete the Great East Asia War," praising Wang Jingwei and the traitorous treaties he signed, flattering Japan, denouncing the Anglo-American Allies, and publishing a photo of herself at the beginning of the article. She also served as the president of the Qingdao Branch of the puppet Women's Association, inciting women to hold wartime women's training for the enemy and puppets, and participated in various forums, with absurd manuscripts published in the puppet 大新民報, extensively advocating and promoting. If she were not insane, how could she have committed such outrageous acts? When the citizens heard of her arrest, they all expressed their delight.

### UK's Education Budget This Year Reaches a Historic High

[British Information Service, London, 29th] The Education Committee of the London City Council has recently approved a budget of 17,500,000 pounds for education this year. This budget is actually the highest amount ever spent on education.

Student Reduction

Before the war, there were a total of 460,000 students in London's municipal primary, secondary, and vocational schools and junior colleges. Due to the impact of the war, the number of students this year will be reduced to 338,000. However, the education budget is 2.5 million pounds higher than last year.

### Group Portrait of Southwest Associated University (Middle)

— Shen Shi

Lectures in the Trees

The best phenomenon of Southwest Associated University is the strong academic atmosphere. Due to the high degree of academic freedom, teachers and students are encouraged to explore academically. Due to the professors' spirit of defending the Way and striving for learning, they have set an excellent example for the students, encouraging them to work hard and strive for progress. This is fully demonstrated in the reading rooms, laboratories, classrooms, and teahouses. The reading rooms, with hundreds of seats, are always full, so the teahouses are crowded with students, especially for lectures by famous professors, especially for attractive and meaningful topics. The audience is even more crowded, not only students from the school, but also those from outside the school who come from afar. Not only are the classrooms full of people, but some also grab the window lattices and climb the branches of the trees. Several professors' courses are usually full. For example, Mr. Jin Yuelin's Epistemology, Mr. Lei Haizong's General History of China, and Ancient and Modern Western History, Mr. Liu Wendian's Zhuangzi, Selected Tang Poems, Mr. Luo Yong's Du Poems, and Mr. Feng Youlan, although he stuttered, many people chose his courses, and Mr. Hughes, who was sent by Oxford University in England to China to study Chinese studies, also had very close interactions with Mr. Feng.

At one academic lecture, Mr. Wen Yiduo spoke on "The Legend of Fuxi"; the door, the windows, the window lattices, and the branches of the trees were full of people. Mr. Wen, from the stone carvings of human-headed snake bodies found in a certain county in Shandong, talked about the totems of the primitive era, talked about Nüwa Fuxi, sketched the romantic affairs of ancient men and women, and elaborated on the Guofeng chapters in the Book of Songs. From this lecture, we got new annotations on "Feng" (風), "Phoenix" (鳳凰), "Fengsao" (風騷), and "Fengma Niu Bu Xiang Ji" (風馬牛不相及). When Mr. Wen spoke, he often touched his beard, and his enthusiasm and kindness showed that he was a gentle scholar at a glance. Mr. Wen was a new poet, and he often advised students to go into the folk, to experience and collect the realistic poetic materials of the folk.

In the "English Poetry" class, the young Professor Xie Wentong explained that the plot of Tennyson's "Break, break, break" was extraordinarily desolate, coupled with Mr. Xie's soft tone, from here we further understood the poet's tenderness and the poet's greatness.

The "Redology" course is the most attractive, whether from the Faculty of Arts, Law, Science, or Engineering, whether inside or outside the school, all participate enthusiastically. Dream of the Red Chamber can also be lectured, which may infuriate the moralists. There are two teachers lecturing on Redology at Southwest Associated University: one is Mr. Wu Yuseng, Mr. Wu is amorous and has many feelings, and often claims to be Miaoyu in Tsinghua Park. Mr. Wu's daughter has been studying in Chengdu in recent years, and Mr. Wu has also left Kunming. I think he has a lovely daughter to serve him, and the flesh and blood are close to each other. Maybe in his old age, he will no longer have the sighs of ancient Buddha and green lamp. The other is Mr. Liu Wendian. Mr. Liu has such a heavy addiction to smoking that one cigarette is not enough, so he connects two or three. He takes a sip of smoke, drinks a sip of strong tea, and his tone is low and weak, but the audience is full. Mr. Liu is proficient in Zhuangzi and often claims that only two people really understand Zhuangzi, one is Zhuang Zhou, and the other is Liu Wendian. He also knows Dream of the Red Chamber. I remember once at his academic lecture, because there were so many people, he changed places three times in a row, and finally decided to lecture in the open air. He used Jia Fei's words "Hua Xu is enough, why Banting (花漵二字便好，何必汀)" to elaborate on "Banting Hua Xu (汀花漵)", "Banting (汀)" cuts "Lin (林)", "Hua Xu (花漵)" means "Xiren (襲人)·Shichai (實釵)", serving Baoyu, Xiren and Baochai are enough, why Daiyu. From this first gathering in the Grand View Garden, we can know the fate of the beautiful woman who is good at sorrow and sickness. Mr. Liu has many unique insights on Redology, and I will just give an example at random.

Spring and Autumn

### Mirror

— Xu Jiatang

A gentleman once wrote an article titled: "Our Mirror." After reading it carefully, it turned out to be a translation of a letter from an American couple talking about the Chinese. I only looked into this mirror once and didn't want to look again, because it was too small, only reflecting a hand, or a foot, or even a navel, and like the ancient bronze mirrors, it only showed a blurred, seemingly correct shadow.

I talked about this with my friends, and they laughed at me for not being used to looking in the mirror.

I am used to looking in the mirror! For a few annoying hairs and a face of prickly beards, when I first arrived in Shanghai, I bought a mirror. This mirror happened to only reflect a head, which was very useful for me. It accompanied me for more than two years, and then fell to the ground and broke.

After I bought this mirror, I found that I was a little thinner, and my complexion seemed to be turning green day by day. This matter worried me for many days, and later I seemed to have talked about it with my friends, and they all laughed vigorously, saying with a bit of ridicule:

"Strange, you're so rosy and you still say you're green!"

So they handed me a mirror, in which I looked much fuller, with plenty of blood, as if I were eating eggs and milk every day.

Compared with my mirror, there were two different faces inside, one green and thin, and the other rosy and full. Since then, I no longer believed in mirrors, but I still used my old mirror as usual, because it was still very useful for me to comb my hair and shave my beard.

Unfortunately, soon, it finally fell to the ground and broke.

Broken is broken, it's not worth regretting for an unfaithful mirror, but after all, it accompanied me for more than two years.

Since then, I have not bought a new one, but only borrowed the glass window to see a little blurred shadow, which is barely useful for combing my hair, and a little difficult for shaving my beard, but I have perfunctorily gone on.

Soon, I was ridiculed by my friends:

"Oh dear, your beard is shaved so messy, don't you even have a mirror?"

I was a little disappointed, so I decided to buy another mirror that would show my face rosy, but my resolution was only a resolution, after all, I was too lazy, and this mirror was never bought successfully. For more than three years, I have had no mirror, and I simply don't know what I look like.

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to see a full-length mirror. This thing is too big for me, but I like it a little, and I want to see what my whole body looks like.

Standing in front of the mirror, I was a little disappointed. My body became as curved as a water wave. I touched the surface of the mirror with my hand, and the glass was not very smooth. I said with a smile:

"This mirror should be sent to the Great World."

Regarding that "Our Mirror," I am a little confused. Am I not used to looking in the mirror? Or are my friends wrong?

### Riverside

— Xiao Qun

Behind our house is a small river, and out of the side door of the back garden is a narrow shore paved with cinder. There, a row of willows are planted in order. In spring, green branches grow out of the yellow and dry trunks, lush and dense. The slender willow branches hang down, sweeping the calm water surface. When a gentle breeze blows, it creates circles of ripples.

When I was a child, I used to enjoy looking at the riverbank, but such opportunities were not many. Adults always thought of many reasons to stop me. The side door to the riverbank was always tightly closed. We could only wait. When the workers had to go to the river to draw water to water the flowers, we would sneak out, but if we were discovered, we would often be severely reprimanded, and we would even be beaten. The most annoying thing was those rude workers, who would also draw out long, scary stories to scare you:

"Be careful not to be swallowed by the Mama Huzi (local dialect, meaning monster) in the river!"

After he shouted so loudly, the adults would come out quickly, with fierce faces and staring eyes. The child was shocked and obediently went in, and then the side door slammed shut, leaving a deep regret in the child's heart.

Children mostly have a strong love for the river, so as long as there is an opportunity, they always think about getting close to it. Various terrifying rumors cannot suppress the child's adventurous enthusiasm. Although they can't let themselves happily melt into the embrace of the water, even if they can use their fingers to stir up the water, they have unspeakable joy. Once, my brother and I took advantage of people's carelessness to touch the water from the stone steps. I can't describe the happiness at that time. We patted the calm river surface with our small hands, and silver waves rose in the air, and small round beads shone with brilliant colors under the sunlight. But later, I don't know why, maybe because of picking river shrimp, we quarreled. We started splashing water and flowers, splashing each other, and the two of us were drenched from head to toe. Later, we started fighting. Because I didn't stand firmly, my foot slipped and I fell into the river. My brother showed an unnamed panic at the time. He shouted loudly, and then the adults ran out. Many people were densely surrounded on the riverbank. By the time I was dragged out of the river by someone, I was already soaked, and a burst of cold air seeped into my spine. I also realized that I had drunk a few mouthfuls of water, and my throat was indescribably uncomfortable.

That very night I fell ill, with a high fever. My family was busy for a while, hired a doctor, and also hired a witch from afar, who muttered and drew a talisman. Everyone in the family said that I had been stung by something in the river. When I woke up from a sleepy sleep late at night, I still heard a female servant calling out in the back garden, the voice was desolate and gloomy, and it felt like a piece of ice was placed on my small heart.

After that incident, my brother was probably beaten severely. When my body slowly recovered, I was strictly forbidden to play on the riverbank, and that side door had even fewer opportunities to open than before. Now the child can at most only look at the outside world through the cracks in the door.

### Sending a Girl Home

— Xu Jingfu

One day at dusk, I came out of the office and strolled down Nanjing Road. I saw a former library administrator who worked in the city's public library walking with a girl. He was wearing a Chinese-style woolen overcoat, and he didn't look rich, but he had a bit of a decadent air. The girl's appearance was not ugly, maybe she was a gentle child from a family below the middle class. I thought they were going back to her home, which is exactly what an American idiom says: sending a poor girl home.

The author feels that the most ordinary things in the world are the most touching. At that moment I mentioned above, there must be many young people like that library administrator walking with his girlfriend. They may have money, or they may not have money. Or they have already found a small job that can barely make a living, but they will never have the opportunity to buy a decent piece of clothing, or buy a luxury item like an electric refrigerator or an electric fan. Life is a heavy burden, not easy to climb up.

This makes the author think of many classmates who came out of college. They have read a lot of books, and knowledge is swelling in their stomachs, but it has become a disease. Their hearts are full of enthusiasm, but they are covered up by the cold society. Please take a look at their situation after a few years. Mr. A is working as a clerk in a bank with a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan. The economics he studied has long been forgotten. Mr. B is working as a supervisor in a factory, with deafening noise and no chance to rest all day. What they think about is not fame, status, or career, but just how to eat three meals of white rice every day.

Mr. C is much luckier. He worked in a company for three years and was unexpectedly promoted by the authorities. He was flattered and worked wholeheartedly for the authorities. At night, when he was lying in bed, he thought of a plan and quickly jumped out of bed to write it down, lest he forget it. He worked like this for three months, and he lost a lot of weight. But he is like a clock with a full spring, vomiting blood.

Is there anything more ordinary than this in the world? Is there any sadness more touching than this? But every day I go out and see groups of people on the street, and I know that this ordinary tragedy is constantly being staged, staged...

Spring and Autumn of the Pen

### Going Through the Motions

— Wu Renzhi

The night is not yet deep, the night is not yet quiet, these days there has been the sound of striking the clapper. The watchman straightens his voice and shouts: "The twelfth lunar month, be careful of fire, close the front door, prop up the back door." In less than two days, the watchman came to ask for money, and from then on there was no sound.

The watchman is doing his job of watching over things, just going through the motions. The money is given as a formality. Most things in the world are like this!

The twelfth lunar month, everyone knows. Be careful of fire, he doesn't care about it at all. The night is not yet deep and the night is not yet quiet, shouting to be careful of the doors is just perfunctory. Since it is unpaid money, then it is paid off as a formality. The watchman and the residents both completed this transaction in a very plain and unremarkable way. The watchman, receiving the money, does not feel ashamed. The residents, giving the money, also never have any demands. And they don't have any pity for the watchman and have no intention of giving alms. Things just passed like this. And it has passed like this year after year, and everyone doesn't care.

Speaking of which, this is a small matter. However, with analysis, a kind of casual, lazy, perfunctory, and time-saving… the weaknesses of national character are expressed here. Small matters do not need to be overly serious so as to waste energy. However, triggering reflection in small matters may be more effective and not lead to failure. If you encounter a big thing and need to reflect, then it is "mending the fold after the sheep is lost", and there will always be a day of "it is too late to regret".

### Twice As Birds, One Nest (10)

— Zhao Qingge

As Madam Mo finished speaking, Master Mo tiptoed in. Madam Weng the Second, very busy, first winked at Madam Mo, then greeted Master Mo with a beaming smile.

"Oh, Big Brother is here! Congratulations, your sister gave you another daughter!"

"Hehe, thanks to your care!" Master Mo said, walking towards the bed.

However, just as Master Mo approached the bedside, wanting to take a look at the baby, the baby suddenly, like before, began to cry-but-not-cry, sing-but-not-sing. This startled Master Mo, and he was even more astonished than before. He immediately connected that strange series of thoughts from earlier; he simply felt that the baby was a demon! If it weren't for Madam Mo being there, he really would have wanted to punch the baby to death.

"Papa! Papa! What's wrong with you? What's wrong?" Bao Ling asked worriedly, shaking Master Mo.

Master Mo was overcome with emotion, unable to suppress it, and suddenly hugged Bao Ling, sobbing in a trembling voice:

"Child! Papa has had a lifelong nightmare, but Papa has finally woken up! You must never follow Papa's example. First, don't become an official; officials never have a good ending. When they are in power, everyone fawns over you, you have everything, and it's easy to be blinded by glory and possibly commit wrongdoings. Once you step down, no one cares about you anymore; you have nothing, and you regret it too late! Second, don't get married; out of ten marriages, nine are unhappy. Papa is an example." At this point, Master Mo paused, as if with some reservations, and corrected himself, "Of course, Papa also wronged your mother, but she can never forgive me, she hates me! Oh, Bao Ling! Papa is finished now, but Papa doesn't want you to be like Papa! Understand? You must be a good man, a dutiful, upright, independent, and free good man."

Master Mo was pouring out all his pent-up emotions to a confidante! His words struck Bao Ling's childish heart heavily, and the child's fragile emotions were greatly stimulated, finally bursting into tears in Master Mo's arms!

Madam Mo was initially a little surprised, but then found it amusing, so she said to Master Mo:

"Look! Even a newborn baby dislikes you, what are you still doing there? Go away!"

Master Mo was both angry and ashamed upon hearing this, and left the bedside with a red face. Coincidentally, as Master Mo walked out of the door, the baby indeed stopped crying. He also heard Madam Mo instructing:

"You can sleep in the study tonight! I can't take you having another night of weird dreams. Besides, the child can't stand you, and I can't stand you either."

Master Mo "hmm"-ed, said nothing, and quickly returned to the study with his head hanging low.

Bao Ling happened to be carrying a cup of tea, saw Master Mo's unhappy expression, and knew he had been upset again. She hurriedly turned around and took the cup of tea to Master Mo in the study. She said:

"Papa, I poured you a cup of hot tea."

Master Mo nodded and sat down listlessly on the chair. At this moment, he felt not only doubt and astonishment, but also very sad, and very indignant!

"I, a Mo, have come to this! This is truly a dream, an unexpected nightmare!"

Master Mo cried out, beating his chest and stomping his feet, then held his head in unbearable pain.

Social Services

### Enthusiastic Support from All Sectors Actively Expanding the Movement

— Editor

The first service meeting was held at this newspaper this morning. Students from various universities invited are requested to attend on time.

Since this newspaper's student aid campaign has been jointly managed with the Shanghai Municipal Education Assistance Fund Committee, the situation has been excellent. In terms of donations, thanks to the enthusiastic and eager contributions from all sectors of society, it has reached over 27 million yuan. A few days ago, Mayor Qian, Chairman Pan, and Director Gu, among others, entertained social celebrities, and nearly 40 million yuan was pledged on the spot. This newspaper will remit the remaining assistance funds of approximately 3.7 million yuan within days, totaling approximately 70 million yuan. The difference from the target of 100 million yuan is only 30 million yuan. It is hoped that within 20 days, the full amount can be raised. It is currently the end of the lunar year, the period for businesses to settle accounts. It is hoped that leaders of various industries and business tycoons will lend a helping hand. I believe that this 30 million yuan in assistance funds can be raised as scheduled. There should be no problem in providing relief to 7,000 to 8,000 poor students.

At 9:00 AM this morning, at the request of the Assistance Fund Committee, this office sent letters to 25 senior students from various universities to hold the first student aid work service team meeting to discuss the direction of work. It is estimated that starting from February 4th, urgent arrangements will be made for applications, registration, investigation, and visits for poor students at all levels of schools, and efforts will be made day and night to complete this year's student aid matters on schedule in order to meet the public's expectations of rescuing those out of school. It is essential that all students invited to this morning's meeting attend together to plan the progress.
