### Joint Meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Council Decides on Four Major Policies for the Present; Executive Yuan to Draft Implementation Measures

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Following the first enlarged memorial service held this week at the National Government Auditorium on the morning of the 6th at 9:00 AM, the first joint meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council since the return to the capital was held at the Chairman's Office Building. Attendees included Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Li Wenfan, Wu Jingheng, Chen Cheng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Weng Wenhao, Wang Shijie, Wu Dingchang, Jiang Menglin, Chen Qingyun, Lin Yunhai, Chen Qicai, Cheng Tianfang, Liu Wendao, Li Jingzhai, Zhu Qing, Yu Hongjun, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, Chen Lifu, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Duan Xipeng, Liu Jianqun, Zhang Daofan, Li Zonghuang, Xiao Tongzi, Liu Keshu, Liu Hengjing, Deng Wenyi, Tian Kunshan, He Zhonghan, Wang Qijiang, Liu Weizhi, Xiao Zheng, Lai Lian, He Yaozu, Liang Hancao, Bai Yunti, and 45 others. President Chiang personally chaired the meeting, which lasted until 12:35 PM. It is reported that attendees engaged in extensive discussions regarding military, political, and economic affairs since the return to the capital, and decided on four major policies: (1) Stabilize prices by increasing production, restoring transportation, curbing speculation, and stabilizing the financial sector through concrete and effective measures. (2) Although the compensation for civil servants has been repeatedly increased, it remains insufficient to meet basic needs due to the continuous rise in prices; therefore, adjustments should be made immediately. (3) Government expenditures due to repatriation, military reorganization, return to the capital, restoration of transportation, and adjustments to the compensation of officers, soldiers, and civil servants should be streamlined and reduced as quickly as possible. (4) The allocation of buildings for government agencies in the capital should be fair and appropriate. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will draft concrete measures for the above four matters to be implemented separately.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold its first formal meeting since the return to the capital at 10:00 AM on the 7th. It is reported that based on the instructions of the joint meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council and the Central Standing Committee, the compensation for civil servants will be increased by 50% to 100% of their current monthly salaries, if possible. Due to soaring prices, the current monthly salary of 140,000 yuan for the mayor of Nanjing is even less than the income of a rickshaw puller. The suffering of low-level civil servants can be imagined. Given the current prices in Nanjing, even doubling the salary would not be excessive.

### First Memorial Week Since Return to the Capital; Chairman Leads Ceremony and Delivers Admonitory Speech, Urging Active Promotion of Party, Government, and Military Work

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The first central memorial week since the return of the National Government to the capital was held at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 6th.

After leading the ceremony, Chairman Chiang delivered an admonitory speech, stating that since the return to the capital, all matters should be actively carried out according to the central government's predetermined plans. Special efforts should be made in the economic, political, and military fields. The work of the Supreme Economic Council should be expedited and advanced within ten days or two weeks. In the political field, the convening of the National Assembly, which was originally agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, should now actively overcome difficulties and seek solutions. In the military field, the first phase of the reorganization plan was completed at the end of last month, but active replenishment and training must be carried out thereafter. He hoped that those responsible for the above three points would continue to implement them according to the plan. The Chairman continued, stating that due to the return to the capital, many resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee have not yet been implemented. Now that all agencies have returned to the capital, he hopes that the comrades responsible for the party affairs and the members of the Central Standing Committee should immediately review the resolutions and plans and implement them as soon as possible. The development of party affairs is related to the success or failure of our revolution. He earnestly hopes that all comrades will make redoubled efforts to shoulder the mission of national construction. After the speech, the Chairman led the entire assembly in reciting the Party Member Code of Conduct, and the ceremony concluded at 9:20 AM.

### Central Propaganda Department Hosts Press; Wu Guozhen Reports on Disaster Relief Efforts; Pan Gongzhan Calls for Elimination of Traitorous Fallacies

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Central Propaganda Department held its first press conference since returning to the capital at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Minister Wu Guozhen personally presided over the conference, which was attended by Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan, Central News Agency President Xiao Tongzi, heads of various newspapers in Nanjing, and over 100 Chinese and foreign reporters. Minister Wu first explained in extremely humble terms that the Central Propaganda Department would assist in the development of the Chinese news industry with the utmost sincerity. He also reported on the efforts of the Central Propaganda Department to purchase paper from Switzerland, Canada, and Japan to alleviate the domestic paper shortage. He then expressed his satisfaction that the newspaper industry in Nanjing had not yet engaged in speculative behavior, such as the small, 12-page magazines with yellow sensationalism and catering to lewdness and theft in Shanghai, and was greeted with applause from the audience. After Minister Wu finished his speech, Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan was invited to stand up and offer two points of opinion: (1) At the peak, there were as many as 50 small newspapers and magazines published in Shanghai after the victory. Although some of them had pure intentions and strived for the upper class, the style of most of them was, as Minister Wu said, invariably teaching lewdness and theft. The Central Propaganda Department should consider correcting this to save the trend. (2) It is heard that the traitors tried in the Soviet Union have all submitted uniform confessions. This type of traitorous theory has been published in newspapers and spread in neighborhoods. Among them, most try to minimize their guilt or pick up half-understood ideas to criticize current affairs. Judging by their intentions, they are simply trying to win public sympathy to cover up their crimes. This does not seem to be a phenomenon that should exist in the restored areas that were anesthetized by the enemy puppets for eight years. General opinion suggests that the government should consider correcting this to clear out the toxins. After Pan finished speaking, the Chinese and foreign reporters in attendance applauded enthusiastically.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen, Vice Ministers Xu Xiaoyan, and Li Weiguo hosted a tea party for the press at the Public Recreation Society at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Over 80 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. This was the first gathering between the Central Propaganda Department and the press of the capital since the return to the capital. Minister Wu delivered a speech, saying that freedom of the press is the government's tentative policy, and the Central Propaganda Department will do its best to serve the press in the future, providing the genuine factual materials necessary for the press. News reporters should base their reporting on facts. Although multi-party politics in democratic countries have various different opinions, they must be based on facts and not distort right and wrong. Only then can good civic morals be fostered in society. Wu also said that freedom of the press in our country is still in its infancy, and the press still needs to make active efforts. He hoped that the press in the capital would report more on public welfare and construction, and strictly prevent news that teaches lewdness and theft. Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan spoke, applying for the urgent correction of yellow sensationalism, and the deep toxicity of traitorous confession should be considered for publication. Xiao Tongzi put forward three hopes: (1) The Executive Yuan should strengthen contact with the press and provide reporting materials. (2) The government should strengthen telecommunications and facilitate news transmission. (3) Newspapers are too expensive, and the government should find a way to subscribe to them on behalf of the press. Gong Debai also hoped that government agency newspapers would promote price reductions. Ma Xingye believed that the Central Propaganda Department's news policy was a landmark policy, and he expressed his support on behalf of the Capital Reporters Association. Mao Jianwu hoped that the Central Propaganda Department would regularly have responsible personnel to contact the press and suggested that the Ministry of Communications be requested to improve telecommunications. Finally, Cao Tianzong, the Nanjing reporter for the News, reported on the brutal situation of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### Sino-U.S. Talks on Treaty of Friendship and Commerce; $60 Million Credit Loan Agreed; Britain to Build Factories in China to Manufacture Jet Propulsion Engines

[United Press, Washington, 5th] American commerce in China is gradually showing signs of revival, and is developing in new directions. Although still affected by Chinese restrictions and currency inflation, in the minds of most people, the future of trade with China is extremely promising. They were initially full of hope that China would establish a strong democratic government due to the initial success of Marshall's mission to China. Now, they are further encouraged by the Chinese government's official guarantee that the Chinese Company Law will not hinder foreign investment. The State Department is currently negotiating a treaty of friendship and commerce with China, and has also requested that China provide better conditions for American commerce. At the same time, diplomats hope that China will make significant concessions. The Export-Import Bank of the United States will also be involved in private enterprises and become a major shareholder in trade with China. The bank will soon extend a credit loan of $500 million to China, of which $60 million has already been approved.

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The Chinese government and Rolls-Royce, one of the largest manufacturing companies in the United Kingdom, have recently signed a contract to manufacture gas turbine and jet propulsion aircraft engines in China. The company announced today that this contract with the Chinese government includes the supply of thousands of drawings and designs to China, as well as the supply of many parts and complete machines, as well as machine equipment for Chinese factories. Several British engineers will travel to China to supervise the construction and assembly of the factory for the future manufacture of Rolls-Royce jet engines. Many Chinese engineers are currently training at the Rolls-Royce factory in Derby, England.

### Xu, Zhou, and Others Inspect Central Hubei; Members of the Military Mediation Department and Chiefs of Staff Convene to Order All Groups to Strictly Enforce Orders

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The key to the overall situation still lies in whether the Communist Army is willing for us to withdraw from Changchun. The government is trying its best to seek true peace with the greatest tolerance and determination. According to information obtained by our reporter, the anxious mood of the Communist Army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, and various places in southern Henan and northern Anhui has not yet calmed down. Due to the military's strengthening of the river defenses and increasing defensive strength in northern Jiangsu, the situation can be seen to be easing.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] It is heard that after Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and General Gillem went to Wuhan to investigate the so-called conflict in central Hubei, no report has yet been received in Nanjing. According to those close to Special Envoy Marshall: Marshal did not receive a report until the 6th. It is also said that the CCP is not very clear about the actual situation in central Hubei. Relevant parties here expect that the three-person committee of Xu, Zhou, and Gillem will have a detailed report coming on the 7th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Brigadier General Gillem, General Xu Yongchang, and General Zhou Enlai traveled to Xuanhua Store upstream of Hankou on the 6th to inspect the front lines in central Hubei where civil war occurred. According to Central News Agency: This highest-level ceasefire enforcement group held long talks yesterday and this morning, but no decision was reached.

[Our Beiping Office, 6th] The three members of the Military Mediation Department and the chiefs of staff have been working very intensely in the past few days. However, these meetings, in addition to increasing difficulties for each other, provide little benefit. As a result of the various difficulties, the transportation problem is very difficult to solve. The continued destruction of transportation or minor conflicts on the various lines no longer seem to be valued. It is heard that the chiefs of staff meeting on the 6th decided to reaffirm the previous order and ordered all enforcement groups to strictly enforce Ceasefire Order No. 6. A certain authority told reporters that they were worried that the failure of the Council of Foreign Ministers might affect the solution of our domestic problems.

### First Batch of Japanese Prisoners of War in Northeast China Begin Repatriation

The last batch was sent yesterday, and the Japanese Disarmed Officers and Soldiers Management Office was ordered to be abolished today.

### Communist Army Crosses the Sea to Expand into Northeast China; Jinan Botou Town Station Attacked

[United Press, Beiping, 6th] According to the Xinsheng Daily: In just two days, May 3 and 4, more than 50,000 Communist troops have crossed the Bohai Strait from the Shandong Peninsula to the Dalian area by sailing ships, reaching the tip of southern Manchuria. The newspaper also said: The Communist troops crossing the strait carried a large amount of food, weapons, and ammunition to reinforce the Communist army positions in southern Northeast China. Transportation authorities told the press today that the entire Pingfan Railway line has been repaired and is now ready to resume two-way traffic.

[Central News Agency, Panjin, 6th] According to information from the transportation sector, all trains south of Shenyang on the China-Chang Railway can now reach Dashiqiao today. The railway from Dashiqiao to Yingkou has also been opened to traffic. It now takes one day and night to reach Yingkou from Jinan.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 6th] The Huabao reported that 30,000 Communist troops have gathered near Gongzhuling to resist the National Army's advance towards Changchun. There are now 70 Communist aircraft gathered in Tongliao, including some U.S.-made P-47s. There are currently 260,000 Communist troops in Shandong Province, most of whom have crossed the sea and infiltrated into Northeast China. According to the Jiuguo Daily: The Communist army is adopting a defensive posture in the Northeast and an offensive posture inside the pass to prevent the National Army from heading to the Northeast. There are now 15 Communist brigades concentrated in Yutian in eastern Hebei Province, plotting to attack the Beining Railway. The Communist army in northern Hebei is consolidating its positions to prevent the National Army from advancing north along the Pinghan Railway.

[United Press, Beiping, 6th] According to government sources here: More than 1,000 Communist troops attacked the Botou Town Station, about 80 miles south of Tianjin, on the morning of the 6th.

At the same time, the Communist army is building strong defense lines along the north bank of the Zhang River to prevent the National Army from advancing north along the Pinghan Railway. According to government sources here: In the past few months, 20 Communist regiments, totaling more than 100,000 people, have successively traveled from the borders of Shaanxi, Hebei, and Henan to Northeast China.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 5th] Bridge No. 74 between Tangguantun Station and Machang Station on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway was destroyed by the Communist army on the night of the 4th.

### Suzhou High Court Retries Wu Yuan Di, a Traitorous Element

[Our Suzhou Office, 6th] Wu Yuan Di, the manager of the puppet Central Reserve Bank's Suzhou branch, was previously sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by the High Court on February 16. The traitor appealed against the sentence and applied for a retrial to the Supreme Court, which ruled to send it back for retrial. The Suzhou High Court held a public trial at around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Because it was necessary for Chen Gongbo to testify in court regarding the motives for issuing the puppet Central Reserve Bank notes, the High Court, for the sake of prudence, specially dispatched the presiding judge of the case, Liu Shichou, to the detention center at around 2:00 PM to interrogate Chen in the nearby location. According to his testimony, the issuance of the puppet currency was to stop the circulation of Japanese military currency and to suppress and stabilize prices. As for the direct responsibility, he completely shifted the blame to Zhou Fohai. The interrogation lasted about 30 minutes. Judge Liu returned to the court, ascended the bench in the second court, and brought Wu to the court for trial. His testimony was strongly defended. After about an hour, the court adjourned and he was sent back into custody.

Chairman Shao reported, first stating the government's difficulties in postponing the National Congress, and then explaining the powers of the Preparatory Committee. After Shao finished speaking, more than ten representatives, including He Bingru, Dai Tianqiu, Chen Zifeng, Chen Guojun, Li Zhenya, and Wang Shuhui, successively stood up to accuse the government of not being accommodating to a few selfish and self-interested factions and postponing the National Congress, which seriously violated public opinion, and their words were extremely poignant. Xiang Yujie, a representative from Hunan, was so angry that he returned the charter. Finally, Shao, chairman of the committee, repeatedly explained and comforted them. After the meeting, it was heard that Chairman Jiang had scheduled a tea party at the Lizhi Society at 4 p.m. tomorrow to receive the representatives, at which time the representatives would directly express their opinions to the chairman.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] "The National Congress will be postponed until after the autumn coolness." Shao Lizi, chairman of the National Congress Preparatory Committee, formally announced this news at a reception for National Congress representatives in Nanjing at 3 p.m. on the 6th. Shao also stated that the Preparatory Committee has decided to continue to receive representatives in Nanjing for ten days from today and assist the representatives in solving transportation problems within these ten days, so that they can temporarily return to their hometowns. The same approach will be taken for the representatives who are currently on their way to Nanjing. However, Shao finally expressed optimism about the future of the country, because he believes that the political consultation under the leadership of Chairman Jiang will be able to satisfactorily resolve the current difficulties. Also, Shao Lizi, chairman of the National Congress Preparatory Committee, held a tea party at the Hongyue Corridor of the Central Political School at 3 p.m. on the 6th to receive the National Congress representatives in Nanjing, including Chen Qiye, Lin Hu, and Chen Guojun, with more than 250 people attending.

Shao delivered a speech at the tea party, first saying: I am very sorry for not being able to come to the capital earlier to serve the representatives, and I pay special respect to the representatives from all over the country who have worked hard for the country. Next, he explained that the Preparatory Committee's authority is solely responsible for preparing for the National Congress, and that political issues are not within the scope of its authority, and reported on the new decision of the Preparatory Committee on the reception of representatives. Finally, he said that the letters and opinions that the representatives entrusted him to forward to Chairman Jiang have been forwarded separately. After Shao's speech, representatives Wang Lifu, He Bingru, Chang Zonghui, Chen Zifeng, etc. expressed their opinions and inquiries about the postponement of the National Congress, the reception of representatives, etc. Shao himself is not only the chairman of the National Congress Preparatory Committee, but also a representative participating in the Political Consultative Conference.

### A Grand Occasion: "The May Fifth Tea Party"

— Special Correspondent for Shen Bao in Nanjing, Zhao Haosheng

The "May Fifth Tea Party" held at the National Government Auditorium at 4:30 p.m. on May 5 was one of the most lively events of the grand celebration of the return to the capital. Ambassadors from various countries, ministers, members of the Central Committee, senators, etc., all received an invitation jointly signed by the chairman and his wife. Inside the gate of the National Government, a row of honor guards stood, saluting each guest who arrived. After signing their names on the signature platforms on the left and right, each person was given a large red circular guest pass with "May Fifth Tea Party" printed on it. Especially the ambassadors and their wives from various countries, when the receptionist hung the guest pass on their lapels, it was like hanging smiles on them—they were smiling for China's victory, because in this long war of resistance against aggression, they fought side by side with the Chinese people. Today, after the overall victory, they should come to share the joy of China's victory.

Chief of Staff He and his wife arrived very early. In front of the signature platform, the reporter asked him to inscribe the four characters "Victorious Return to the Capital" on a card as a souvenir. Soviet Ambassador Petrov, wearing a navy blue serge suit and light brown striped pants, arrived with his elegantly dressed wife, smiling. Ten minutes before the tea party began, in the large hall with towering vermilion pillars, Marshal Marshall, who was tall and strong, also arrived suddenly. He cordially walked and talked with his wife in the hall. He was extremely interested in the magnificent architecture of the National Government. Marshal Ma understood China, and he knew that the vermilion pillars were a symbol of solemnity, loftiness, and authority. He was explaining to his wife in a low voice, looking up at the painted roof, with a moving smile on his face. He was still wearing a serge American military uniform that day, with the shoulder straps of a five-star marshal in white. The marshal's clothing was no different from what the reporter saw in Chongqing four months ago, but his chest seemed straighter and his face seemed rosier. Marshal Ma maintains his health through constant work. Marshal Ma's wife is an unusually quiet lady with a kind face. She wore a light brown silk low-cut suit, fastened with a belt with gold buttons, and a delicate hat adorned with a pink and a light blue camellia. Walking through the second door, she took off her fur shawl and white gloves together and draped them over her arm. Her body was as strong as Marshal Ma's, but not as slender as Marshal Ma's. This pair of equally kind and healthy elderly couple is a beautiful picture of life. These smiling and side-by-side guests became the most watched figures. In front of the signature platform, Marshal Ma's wife first lightly wrote a line of beautiful words on the exquisite and huge signature book. Marshal Ma more solemnly wrote his signature beginning with a large S. When the receptionist put the small guest pass on their lapels, Marshal Ma and his wife looked at each other and smiled, constantly saying, "Thank you."

There were military attachés in full dress, gentlemen in tailcoats, and the ladies were all dressed up. Although their clothes were different, their faces were filled with the same joy. The distinguished guests walked to the lounge or shook hands and talked in the corridor. The National Government was filled with joy.

When the reporter attended the meeting, he brought a Shen Bao. In the corridor, he met Mr. Shao Lizi, a senior figure in the press. He first borrowed the newspaper brought by the reporter, took off his glasses, and stood in the corridor to read it. Then, an office worker from the Chairman's Office who was familiar with the reporter came over and said that the Chairman now wanted to read Shanghai newspapers, but he didn't know if the newspapers had arrived yet. At that time, it was past 4 o'clock, and the newspapers had arrived in Nanjing, but they probably hadn't been delivered because it was difficult to pass through the roads of the National Government. The reporter gave the Shen Bao that Mr. Shao was reading to him to forward to the Chairman. This was the first Shanghai newspaper that the Chairman saw on the day of the return to the capital.

At 4:30 p.m., the Chairman and his wife came out from inside, still wearing the clothes they wore when they paid respects at the mausoleum in the morning, except that the Chairman was not wearing a hat. The guests in the corridor separated to both sides and stood at attention to pay their respects. The Chairman nodded and smiled, repeatedly saying "Good! Good!", and greeted the guests on both sides to walk forward. The madam smiled and nodded to everyone.

The military music sounded, and the guests followed the Chairman and his wife into the venue. In the square hall, four long tables were set up, and various famous and expensive snacks were piled high in large plates. The tea party was held in the form of a cocktail party. The guests moved freely and ate refreshments. The military band played the most cheerful music, and waiters served lemonade. Inside the hall, Chinese and foreign civil and military officials gathered, and the fragrance of the ladies' clothes and shadows filled the air. The huge hall could not contain this overwhelming joy.

Chairman Jiang stood in the middle of a row of long tables, constantly greeting the guests to eat refreshments. To the left of the Chairman was Ambassador Petrov, and to the right was President Song and Foreign Minister Wang. Under the glass windows on the right side of the hall, there was an even more touching scene. The Chairman's wife and Marshal Ma's wife sat around a round table. Marshal Ma was in a very relaxed posture, holding the backs of the two ladies' sofas with both hands, talking and laughing. The laughter in this corner was loud and continuous, forming the highest note in the great chorus of joy.

The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced the military attachés, counselors, and their wives from various countries to the Chairman one by one, and shook hands, bowed, and congratulated him. Finally, the Chairman walked to the round table where the Chairman's wife and Marshal Ma's couple were. Marshal Ma and his wife once again shook hands with the Chairman to congratulate him. The Chairman and his wife, in their capacity as hosts, asked the guests to enjoy more refreshments.

The reporter asked the officials to sign their names on their business cards in the crowd. When he approached the Chairman's wife and explained his intention, the madam smiled and nodded in agreement. She put down the teacup in her hand and happily wrote the four characters "Victorious Return to the Capital" on the armrest of the sofa with a pen. Readers can see the Chairman's wife's happy mood in this light stroke.

At 5:30 p.m., the Chairman and his wife said goodbye to everyone and walked out of the hall. The tea party was still in progress. In this extremely joyful mood, people would forget the time.

The party ended happily after six o'clock. The military music played a reluctant farewell tune, and the setting sun plated a layer of bright red on the faces of each guest, which were full of joy. (Late night on the 5th in Nanjing)

### Chiang Ching-kuo Arrives in Nanjing

Shen Honglie Scheduled to Return to Zhejiang on the 9th

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Nanjing by plane from Chongqing at 2:30 p.m. on the 6th. The chairman of Zhejiang, Shen Honglie, is scheduled to return to Zhejiang from Nanjing on the 9th.

### Marshal Eisenhower to Fly from the Philippines to Nanjing Tomorrow or the Day After Tomorrow, to Visit Chairman Chiang and Confer with Marshal Marshall

[Our Report] According to reliable sources: U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower has recently inspected military facilities in the Manila area of the Philippines and discussed the construction of air bases with the Philippine government. He will fly directly to Nanjing from Manila tomorrow or the day after tomorrow to visit Chairman Chiang and meet with Marshal Marshall. He will stay for about three hours and then transfer to Korea and Tokyo. The trip to Shanghai has been canceled. U.S. Army Commander in China Lieutenant General Gillem will make a special trip to Nanjing to welcome him.

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 6th] On the anniversary of the victory in Europe, Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower issued a statement saying: "The first anniversary of the victory in Europe will inspire the Army to reaffirm their confidence in the solemnity and freedom of mankind. So many people have fought and lost their lives for these freedoms, which should remind us that nations cannot say that they have fulfilled their responsibilities to those who fought for their victory until permanent and universal peace has been established. When the guns of Europe fell silent, the need for continuous and consistent effort and personal sacrifice did not cease. The fighters of the United Nations have given us a second chance in thirty years, or perhaps our last chance, to eliminate the inhumanity of terror in the world. In fact, the world can no longer tolerate another war. Those who wear the Army uniform are committed to the priceless reality of security for our country, and they are excited by the prospect that the increasing mutual trust between nations will one day make the work of combat personnel a thing of the past."

### Prospects for Domestic Politics After the Return to the Capital

Yesterday, the government returned to the capital. Chairman Chiang, leading civil and military officials and representatives of the people, paid their respects to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. This is a grand occasion that the Chinese people have been praying for day and night for the past eight years. At this historic moment, at the celebration meeting of all sectors of the capital, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech to the soldiers and civilians of the whole country. This is a historical document for this historical occasion. Although the words are concise, the meaning is extremely profound. This is Chairman Chiang's first announcement to the soldiers and civilians of the country after his triumphant return to the capital. In this speech, Chairman Chiang announced to us: "...We should learn from the pain, never forget the enslavement, the servitude, and the dark and hopeless lives we have suffered under the enemy's iron hooves for the past eight years. We must be vigilant and strive for self-reliance and self-strengthening. In particular, the national humiliation of the September 18th Incident fifteen years ago, when Shenyang in the Northeast was captured, should be deeply remembered as a permanent historical lesson for our Chinese nation for generations to come. Fellow countrymen, the government's return to the capital today only signifies the end of our war of resistance against Japan. It is the victory we achieved through the National Government's policy of resisting to the end and leading all soldiers and civilians to sacrifice and struggle. However, although we have recovered Shenyang today, the integrity of the entire administration and sovereignty of the Northeast still requires the sincere cooperation and continued efforts of all our compatriots for the country and the nation to maintain the glorious fruits of our final victory. Only in this way can we comfort the spirits in heaven of the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and the revolution over the past eight years..." Indeed, the government's return to the capital only signifies the end of our war of resistance against Japan. We must continue to work hard to ensure the glorious fruits of our final victory—the integrity of the entire administration and sovereignty of the Northeast. Chairman Chiang's special emphasis on this point at the historical occasion of the return to the capital has a profound meaning, which needs no further explanation.

Currently, in China, we see the government's triumphant return to the capital, but on the other hand, we see the Communist Party's troops instigating wars everywhere, attacking the National Army. The capture of Changchun and the unfolding of the war in the Northeast clearly demonstrate the Communist Party's attempt to undermine the National Army's takeover of the Northeast. Similar combat actions have recently spread from North China to northern Jiangsu, with the aim of weakening the National Army and expanding the Communist Army's defense zone. All these combat actions are initiated by the Communist Party. The National Army has no choice but to defend itself under the principle of self-defense. However, the Communist Party propagandizes that their offensives are defensive and are for internal war. Such propaganda is originally confined to the wise. With such an open fact placed before the Chinese people, and with objective reports from impartial third parties, even those with limited wisdom will be able to distinguish between right and wrong. This kind of distortion of facts by the Communist Party, undermining national unity and instigating war, is not worthy of being called "internal war." From the perspective of the state, the Communist Party's military actions are a rebellion, not an "internal war." This is an illegal, unrestrained, and reckless act of treason that disregards the interests of the nation. In principle, it should be suppressed and punished. However, the government, based on the principle of peace and unity, has not launched a punitive expedition. This is the government's painstaking effort to show consideration for the people's suffering after the war and to make concessions for peace. The people need peace, and the government also needs peace. The only one who does not want peace is the Communist Party. Moreover, people from all walks of life are calling for peace. Some people in Shanghai have even organized a so-called "Shanghai People's Organizations Federation" to call for peace. We must especially point out that the government needs peace as much as the people do, but it is the Communist Party that is undermining peace. If we want peace, we must first stop the Communist Party's actions and attempts to undermine peace. We cannot reverse the facts and distort the truth. If we do not analyze the situation and call for peace in a general way, the result will only be to condone the Communist Party's harm to the country and the people. The more we call for peace, the less we can ensure peace.

We must also point out that the development of the situation in the Northeast to the present stage, namely the failure to restore the integrity of the entire administration and sovereignty of the Northeast, is clearly due to the Communist Party's sabotage. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the entire Northeast should have been taken over by the National Government. Before the National Army arrived, the Communist Army rushed to the Northeast to obstruct the National Army's takeover, occupy cities, and engage in illegal activities. All of this has been objectively reported by impartial third parties. Unless one has ulterior motives and is willing to be a traitor to the country, one will have a clear understanding of the development of the situation in the Northeast. Sovereignty is indivisible, and territory is indivisible. The Northeast is China's Northeast, the Northeast of the Chinese people. The Chinese people's only wish for the past fifteen years has been the recovery of the Northeast, and the recovery of the Northeast is the responsibility of the National Government. Therefore, we cannot have any specializations under any pretext. The entire Northeast must be taken over by the National Government. To take into account the objective facts, the proposal made by Special Envoy Marshall that the Communist Army immediately withdraw from Changchun and then discuss other matters is already a concession in nature, because the entire Northeast should have been recovered by the National Government and there should not have been any problems. Requiring the Communist Party to withdraw from Changchun before discussing other matters is already a major concession, a concession that should not have been made in law. However, in order to take into account all objective facts and to appreciate Special Envoy Marshall's good intentions, if we accept this proposal, we should not make any further concessions. The Communist Party's so-called "unconditional ceasefire" is a guarantee to protect the territory they have occupied and to prevent the central government from taking over, which is equivalent to a robber shouting to the police after stealing something and forbidding them from shooting and arresting the thief. There is no reason to accept it at all. As for the so-called "the Northeast issue should be decided by a vote of the people of the Northeast," that is even more absurd. The Northeast is China's Northeast and does not require a vote of the people of the Northeast. This is different from the situation of the "Alsace-Lorraine" provinces contested by France and Germany, and cannot be compared. Therefore, the statement "the Northeast issue should be decided by a vote of the people of the Northeast" is not something that Chinese people should say. This statement violates the national interests of China and is similar to the behavior of the fifth column selling out national interests.

In response to the current situation in China, the government is making concessions in order to seek peace, and the people are earnestly demanding peace. When we call for peace for the people, we can only earnestly demand that the Chinese Communist Party stop all disturbances inside and outside the Customs. The Communist Party's offensive has spread from the Northeast outside Shanhaiguan to Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu near Beijing and Shanghai. The people have suffered eight years of war. How can they bear the disaster of war again? Although there may be differences in political views and policies, we should strive for the sympathy of the people in an enlightened manner. We must never let the people who have suffered from the ravages of war suffer the calamity of war again. China is a whole. This is neither the China of the Kuomintang nor the China of the Communist Party, but the China of the Chinese people. Although political parties may have party disputes, we cannot deepen the suffering of the people. What is currently deepening the suffering of the Chinese people is the disruptive action of the CCP. For the sake of the people, we earnestly request the CCP to stop all disruptive actions.

For the sake of the Chinese people, we must also point out another fact. Since the open activities of political parties, many political parties have emerged. Among them, there are indeed political groups that are loyal to the country, but there are also useless politicians who only know how to compete for territory for their parties or even for themselves. Since the "Political Consultative Conference," there have been few political disputes over policies and principles, and more disputes over territory. This has created a very bad impression among the Chinese people. We want to ask which people the "political parties" that have emerged in recent times can represent and how many people's intentions they can represent. I am afraid that even the leaders of the various parties cannot answer this question. Most of the Chinese people are not affiliated with any party. China has so many followers of Islam, but there is no political party organized by the followers of Islam. There are over five million followers of Christianity, of which over four million are followers of Catholicism, but there is no political party organized by the followers of Christianity or a political party organized by the followers of Catholicism. It can be seen that the intentions of the majority of the Chinese people cannot be represented by these minority political parties. To respect the national public opinion, we must not overemphasize the private opinions of a few parties. We must seek the intentions of the people from other aspects. The public opinion that a few parties can represent may not be the full picture of public opinion. Now that the National Government has returned to the capital and is starting anew with the people, we must especially point out this point.

China needs stability, and the world needs stability. Whether the world can be stable and whether lasting peace can be ensured largely depends on the development of the situation in China. The "September 18th Incident" and the subsequent evolution of the situation in the Northeast triggered World War II. Now the whole world, including China, is coming out of this historical catastrophe. We should work harder to achieve stability and ensure peace. Now that the National Government has returned to the capital, all our people should uphold the good intentions in Chairman Chiang's speech, cooperate sincerely for the country and the nation, and continue to work hard to ensure the glorious fruits of our final victory. Looking forward to domestic politics after the return to the capital, we cannot but frankly state our intentions.

### Local Correspondence

Suzhou

Increase the Purchase Price of Military Grain: Our county previously received an order from the province to raise 70,000 piculs of military grain. The original official price was 5,000 yuan per picul. By the end of last year, one-half had been handed over. Since the New Year, rice prices have soared, with market prices reaching more than 30,000 yuan, which is too different from the official military grain price, making it difficult to continue purchasing. The county government has repeatedly argued with the Provincial Grain Bureau, but to no avail. Recently, an order was received to adjust the price to 8,000 yuan in legal tender per picul, ordering the remaining grain to be delivered. However, the new official price is still very different from the current market price, and the county fears that the future of people's food will be greatly affected.

Changshu

A Major Traitor from Shazhou is Arrested in Changshu: Yang Xingfang, a major traitor from Shazhou City in the Seventh District of this area, was arrested on the 2nd and sent to the court for investigation. During the occupation period, Yang served as the commander of the New Fourth Army's People's Anti-Japanese Command in Shazhou City. In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he served as the commander of the enemy's landing force in the pseudo-Chengxi-Yu three counties "bandit suppression" force. Recently, he secretly came to Changshu from Shanghai and was reported by someone. The police bureau arrested him at the Huyuan Hotel.

Zhenjiang

Adjusting the Military Grain Purchase Work: The Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday (the 4th) ordered the Zhenjiang County Government to complete the military grain requisition work within a time limit. Regarding the previous order to purchase 20,000 piculs of military grain, which has not yet been fully purchased, considering the difficulty of purchasing, after adjustment, the original quota has been reduced to 15,000 piculs. In addition to the 7,638 piculs that have already been delivered, the missing grain amount will be allowed to increase the purchase price by 8,000 yuan per picul, plus the original 5,000 yuan, for a total of 13,000 yuan per picul. It is required to make up the full amount before May 10. After receiving the order, the county government was extremely anxious and decided to convene an emergency meeting of the County Council and the Rice and Grain Association on the 6th to discuss purchasing methods.

Preparing to Expand the Respect Teachers Movement: The issue of improving the treatment of elementary school teachers in this county has been satisfactorily resolved. The Education Bureau has submitted it to the Education Department for approval and can be issued according to the new standards before the 15th of this month. Afterwards, it can be issued monthly. The County Party Headquarters and the Provisional Senate are preparing to expand the Respect Teachers Movement and have organized a support committee to promote propaganda work.

Celebrating the National Government's Victorious Return to the Capital: Before the start of the War of Resistance, the National Government moved its capital to Chongqing. Now, with the victory of the War of Resistance, the Central Government has decided to return to the capital on May 5. All sectors of Jiaxing held celebrations on that day. The County Party Headquarters specially convened representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools at 9:00 AM to hold a grand ceremony. Slogans were posted, movie theaters offered free admission to military police and civil servants, and shops automatically reduced prices to give preferential treatment to customers.

Fengxian

The List of County Senators is Finalized: The list of provisional senators for this county, as required by law, was finalized by the Jiangsu Provincial Government on the 4th.

Huzhou

Dispatching Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate Electoral Bribery: The Second District Commissioner's Office recently received a secret report: In the election of senators in Changxing on April 25, in addition to some who were legally elected according to procedures, Chen Zhongmou used 200,000 yuan to bribe 40 votes and held banquets to get elected, causing a public outcry. After the commissioner reported this, he immediately dispatched personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and deal with it according to law.

### Four Foreign Ministers Held Informal Meeting Yesterday, Still No Concrete Progress Achieved, Byrnes Firmly Opposed Soviet Proposals, The Success or Failure of the Meeting Depends on This Week

[United Press Paris 6th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference reopened informally today. US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held private talks for a long time, but ultimately failed to achieve any concrete progress on the deadlock of the Italian issue. It is reported that Byrnes is determined to resist the Soviet side's efforts to make Trieste a city of the Southern countries and to gain a foothold in Tripolitania. During the weekend recess, Byrnes has prepared to oppose the Soviet side's actions in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean. There is now a general feeling between the British and American representatives that this week will be one of the most decisive weeks. Whether the foreign ministers can reach some kind of agreement or have to admit complete failure depends entirely on this week.

[Another telegram] In order to break the deadlock of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, US Secretary of State Byrnes has been holding informal talks with the foreign ministers in recent days. It is reported that the Italian issue and the disposition of Trieste still cannot be resolved in informal talks. It is generally believed that these informal talks are the last chance to resolve the difficulties.

[Associated Press Paris 6th] American sources here disclosed today: The United States may make concessions on the Balkan issue in exchange for Soviet concessions on the Italian issue, in order to break the deadlock of the four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference in France. It is reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has suggested that if Trieste is assigned to Yugoslavia, the Soviet side will give considerable consideration to Italy's interests on the issue of Italian colonies and reparations. However, according to authoritative sources: US Secretary of State Byrnes and his advisors firmly believe that Italy should maintain Trieste and have decided not to give up an inch. It is said that although Molotov's proposal has been rejected, it is still the first indication that it may break the deadlock. The compromise point may involve the United States recognizing Bulgaria, and a part of Yueshuer and Niyia being assigned to Romania.

[United Press Paris 5th] The four major foreign ministers reached a final agreement last night on the issue of disposing of the Italian fleet and two small islands in the Adriatic Sea.

[French News Agency Paris 5th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov hosted a banquet for US Secretary of State Byrnes tonight.

### US Drafts Treaty of Peace with Austria, Main Points of Draft

[Reuters Paris 6th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference has failed to get the Soviet Union to agree to withdraw its troops stationed in Austria early. US Secretary of State Byrnes drafted a draft treaty of peace with Austria at the beginning of the meeting. The document has not yet been published. It is reported that this draft is in the nature of a memorandum, and its main points are as follows: (1) Restore Austria's independence, guaranteed by the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union and France to guarantee Austria's independence under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Security Council; (2) The occupation of Austria should end immediately after the treaty comes into effect; (3) The four major powers will introduce Austria to participate in the United Nations organization; (4) Austria's national boundary is still the boundary of 1937, but if Austria proposes small-scale amendments regarding the Austrian-Italian boundary, it can be considered; (5) Austria must guarantee that its domestic residents, regardless of race, language, religion, or gender, have basic human freedom and rights, the most important of which are freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of belief, freedom of thought, and freedom of assembly; (6) Austria can establish complete diplomatic relations with other countries, and shall not be restricted or controlled by foreign countries except as otherwise provided in this treaty; (7) Austria's military strength should be limited to what is sufficient to maintain domestic治安, protect border security. In addition, if the Security Council orders Austria to supply military strength, Austria may also organize troops within the scope of its order.

### Iran Officially Receives Soviet Notification, Soviet Troops Have Completed Withdrawal, Security Council to Meet Tomorrow, Negotiations Between the Iranian Government and the Province of Azerbaijan Have Reached a Stalemate

[This newspaper] London 6th Broadcast: The Iranian government officially received notification from the Soviet Union this afternoon that the Soviet troops have completed their withdrawal. It is also learned that the United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet at 7:00 PM on the 8th to discuss this issue.

[United Press Tehran 5th] According to a broadcast from Greater Azerbaijan Radio: The last batch of Soviet troops withdrew from the capital of Azerbaijan tonight. But Iran is still threatened by civil war. The situation in Iran has changed drastically over the weekend: (1) The peaceful negotiations between the Iranian central government and the government of Azerbaijan are said to have reached a stalemate; (2) Azerbaijan and the Kote Autonomous Government signed a military-political alliance; (3) It is reported that a large number of Iranian troops are being transferred north; (4) The Deputy Minister of the Army of Azerbaijan issued a warning to the Iranian government saying: "Our position is firm."

[Reuters Tehran 6th] The Soviet Embassy hosted a banquet for Iranian Prime Minister Sadana, government spokesman Ferush, and cabinet members yesterday afternoon. Soviet Ambassador Shachikov praised Sadana during the banquet and said that the Soviet policy is based on promoting friendship between the two countries. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from northern Iran can show the goal of the Soviet policy. Sadana replied that he was ashamed of the Soviet ambassador's praise of him, and that he would continue to work hard in the future, hoping that the ambassador would continue the spirit of friendly understanding so that the Iranian people could express their sincere cooperation. Judging from the withdrawal of Soviet troops, we can see that the Soviet government really wants to make our country complete its independence and prosperity.

[Associated Press Washington 5th] The Iranian Embassy announced today: Iranian Ambassador Aleding will go to New York tomorrow to report the withdrawal of Soviet troops to the United Nations Security Council. It is now learned that once the Iranian ambassador submits the report, the Iranian case can be removed from the agenda.

### Spanish Underground Organization Suddenly Active, Republican Government Leaders Arrive in England

[Reuters Madrid 6th] Since the United Nations organization decided to set up a committee to investigate the Franco regime, underground activities in Spain have suddenly become active. The purpose of the underground activists is to organize a government composed entirely of the people. They believe that this government will enjoy more international prestige than the fugitive government.

[Reuters London 6th] Former Spanish Republican Prime Minister Guilar arrived here from Paris last night. Hundreds of people from the British Labour Union and Spanish refugees welcomed him at the station. Mr. Guilar will deliver a speech to a joint meeting of the British Houses of Commons and Lords on Tuesday.

### China and Australia Oppose Soviet Proposals on Security Council Veto Issue

[Central News Agency New York 5th Special Telegram] The committee of experts responsible for formulating the rules of procedure of the Security Council was originally most concerned about the veto issue. Now, because Australia and China oppose the Soviet proposal to expand the five major powers' veto plan, this issue has become even more difficult. The Soviet Union's new proposal on the veto is contained in the Soviet official document, and its content is: "Regarding the issues discussed by the Security Council, is it in the nature of procedure? If a problem belongs to the nature of dispute or situation, and whether this issue is involved in Article 33 of the United Nations Constitution?" The decision of these issues, if passed by a vote of seven members of the Security Council, including the permanent members of the Security Council, shall be deemed to be adopted. According to a United Nations observer's explanation, the Soviet proposal will make the use of the veto exceed the principles set by the Charter. Regarding this point, it is heard that my representative Liang Qunli strongly stated at the recent expert committee meeting that the Soviet proposal has far violated the guarantees made by the founding countries in San Francisco, that is, the use of the veto should be restrained and based on. The Soviet proposal will also make the Yalta veto provision meaningless. It is heard that only France has approved the Soviet Union's interpretation of the veto in principle. Britain and the United States have not yet expressed their opinions, but it is generally speculated that the two countries will follow the same attitude adopted in Yalta.

### Australian Prime Minister Travels to America to Visit Truman

At this time, Webb said: "This is not the time for you to give a speech. You only need to answer whether you plead guilty or not." Araki then said, "Not guilty!" Finally, when questioned Tojo, Tojo replied: "I believe that all the charges made by the prosecutor are not guilty." All twenty-eight Japanese war criminals pleaded not guilty in Japanese. Only Matsuoka answered in English, but when he answered in English, no one could understand him due to his low voice. Then, Presiding Judge Webb announced the adjournment. The court will reconvene on June 3. At that time, the prosecution will present the indictment for the first batch of cases, and then listen to the defendants' statements on June 13.

Later, due to its outstanding achievements, it gradually expanded from Nanshi to Zhabei, Pudong, and Caohejing. Although it was limited by funding at the time, it was not as well-equipped as the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the former concession. However, under the guidance of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Defense Committee in 1931, its organization and strength were gradually strengthened, finally achieving the goal of "self-defense and defending others."

On November 12, 1937, Shanghai fell, and the Defense Corps also announced its dissolution with the National Army's westward retreat. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, at the request of local gentry and merchants, Mayor Qian restored the organization on November 16 last year and merged the Chinese Team of the former Shanghai Volunteer Corps to form the Shanghai Defense General Corps. The city was divided into eight districts: Hudong, Hunan, Haxi, Hubei, Huzhong, Punan, Pubei, and Wusong, with Generals Ke Youlue and Zhang Jintang serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively.

In order to understand the general situation and work overview of the organization since its establishment, the reporter specially visited Commander Rong yesterday. He is a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy and the fourth class of the Army University. Judging from his attitude, you would not believe that he is a famous general who has been through many battles. In particular, in the Battle of Hengyang, he, together with Army Commander Fang Xianjue and the three division commanders Zhou Qingxiang, Ge Xiancai, and Rao Shaowei, fought bloody battles in the isolated city for as long as forty-seven days. Rong had just returned from inspecting the corps in various districts the day before. He said: "The general situation is good, but the quality of the current corps members in various districts is recognized as needing to be improved. Therefore, an education implementation outline has been formulated and distributed to various units for active training, which is expected to be completed by the end of July."

Because the allocation of firearms is insufficient, our members have decided to reduce the number of people. Recently, we are also planning to establish nursing teams in various districts to provide voluntary service to the community, but the most difficult thing is funding. He also said: "The outside world does not understand the actual situation of the corps and believes that we have ample funding. In fact, since its establishment, we have only relied on 50% of the entertainment tax and donations from various circles to maintain it. To date, the clothing costs have not been paid on time, and the entertainment tax subsidy approved by the municipal government is only for six months." In terms of strength, in addition to the corps in various districts, the general headquarters also has two standing corps and one special service squad and a heavy machine gun squad. The cadres of the standing corps are all official officers, and the members are young people who have passed the ideological, academic, and physical examinations. Because the corps is entirely a local self-defense organization, its duties are limited to assisting the military police in maintaining local security. During the winter defense period last year, the maximum number of personnel directly and indirectly participating in the duty reached 3,240. In addition, because all corps members are able to work hard, bear hardships, and serve enthusiastically, they have successively captured more than 80 bandits in more than 80 cases in five months. Ye Zubing, the adjutant of the Hubei District Corps, even died in the line of duty while catching bandits. At the beginning of last month, he was also ordered to guard the houses left by Japanese expatriates and be responsible for the defense of the suburbs and the guarding of warehouses everywhere. Starting this month, the defense has been strengthened, and all district corps and standing corps are participating in the duty.

Rong is very modest. He said that he welcomes all circles to criticize the work of the Defense Corps. If there are any suggestions to give them, they are very welcome.

### No Prospect of Jardine Matheson Ships Being Exported; Failure to Change to Using Chinese Crew Causes Serious Negotiations - Seamen's Union Submits Conditions to the Company

[Our Paper's Report] The Jardine Matheson and Swire Shipping Companies were temporarily allowed to operate coastal routes due to the coordination of post-war relief goods. Now, Swire has designated ships and plans to expand to Guangzhou. The new ship Fuzhou, which arrived in Shanghai the day before, is not only unable to be exported due to the unresolved crew issue, but also involves the Jinan and Hubei ships. Not only is there no prospect of export, but also goods other than fruits have not been unloaded. This dispute is of great importance to the future of Chinese seamen. Jardine Matheson uses ships from the Zhongyin Shipping Company, while Swire uses its own ships. Before the Japanese invasion, there were more than 100 ships operating on the Yangtze River and coastal routes. After the Japanese launched the invasion of the South, the ships of the two companies successively retreated south, from Hong Kong, Singapore, and various ports in Southeast Asia to India. Except for senior officers such as the captain, chief mate, second mate, and third mate, who were British, the remaining business directors, helmsmen, stoker, deckhands, and service personnel were all Chinese. After the ships retreated to Southeast Asia and India, the Chinese were expelled, resulting in countless sacrifices or even becoming beggars, which was extremely tragic. After the victory, the two companies resumed operations and built new ships. Chinese people have also been employed on the old ships' holds and decks. However, the new ships use natives from the South Pacific Islands. The Swire Fuzhou, which came to Shanghai for the third time the day before, has not yet changed to using Chinese crew. The Shanghai Seamen's General Union immediately sent personnel to negotiate with Swire, stating that countless Chinese seamen served the company during the war and sacrificed their lives, and they should resume work now that the company has resumed operations. They also proposed conditions that mainly called for resuming work and providing pensions to the families of the deceased. Swire did not respond. Last Saturday, the seamen petitioned the British manager of the company, but to no avail. The goods from the Hubei, Jinan, and Fuzhou ships have not been unloaded. It is reported that the British manager of Swire went to the Seamen's Union yesterday to discuss the matter, but there was no result. Before this matter is resolved, there is no prospect of the three ships being exported.

### How to Handle Goods Not Suitable for Direct Relief? The American Chamber of Commerce Submits a Memorandum

[Our Paper's Report] Relief goods supplied by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to China are often not suitable for direct post-war relief purposes. There has been much debate in all circles regarding the handling of such goods. It is now heard that the American Chamber of Commerce in this city has specially submitted a memorandum to Mr. Ormstead, the chief of the UNRRA representative in China, proposing that, without hindering the existing trade routes in China, allocation methods should be stipulated regardless of nationality. (1) American goods should be handled by the UNRRA liaison group set up by the American Chamber of Commerce; British goods should be handled by the UNRRA liaison group set up by the British Chamber of Commerce; responsible for maintaining close contact with UNRRA to be informed of the arrival, unloading, and transportation of various non-relief goods of UNRRA and reporting to the regular importers of the goods. (2) In principle, non-relief goods of UNRRA should be sold by the original American merchants for American goods and by the original British merchants for British goods; if the goods have distributors of other nationalities, they should still be sold by merchants of that nationality. (3) Goods with trademarks that already have exclusive distributors should still be sold by the exclusive distributors. Goods without trademarks and without exclusive distributors should be sold by distributors who distribute similar goods. (4) Goods that have never been imported before should be discussed and selected by the chambers of commerce of the countries of origin to select appropriate distributors. The memorandum concludes by saying that if the above recommendations are implemented, it will rationalize China's international trade and UNRRA can also obtain higher prices for selling these non-relief goods to purchase food and engage in other relief work.

### Daylight Robbery of Car

At around 10:00 AM yesterday, car No. 20283 was blocked by five bandits with guns on No. 5 Bridge, Lubin Road, Haxi. Three gold rings and tens of millions of legal tender were robbed, and the robbers fled to the southwest.

### Free Vaccination

The China Sanatorium on Madang Road and the Nanshi Civilian Hospital at No. 775 Minguo Road, Xiangyuan Garden, will jointly provide free cholera, typhoid, and meningitis vaccinations for citizens in view of the arrival of summer. There will be no fees charged from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the afternoon.

### Three Robbers Executed - Committed Robbery Last Winter

[Our Paper's Report] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters executed three robbers, Liu Liangsi, 24, from Ningbo; Jiang Zhigui, 23, from Danyang; and Feng Gelin, 22, from Jiading, at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. They broke into the home of the Zhou family in Zhoujiatang, Shanghai County, on November 18 last year and robbed them. After being arrested, they were sent to the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. After the interrogation confirmed the facts, they were sentenced to death and approved by the Army Headquarters for execution.

### Black Market Emerges Under Gold-Dollar Kingdom's Price Control Policy

— By Mao Shuqing, Special Correspondent in the US for this Newspaper's New York Airmail Edition, 25th Day

A week around Easter, I witnessed what Americans call "economic disorder" for the first time. Such a situation was unimaginable to me during my travels in Europe, and even before stepping foot on this new continent.

In many American military camps in Europe, there were mountains of bread, butter, and white sugar. Many sergeants, tired of managing the kitchen, would grab handfuls of food and throw them on the ground. I crossed the Atlantic on the warship William Mary, and on board, I saw American "roughnecks" throwing boxes of canned food into the sea. But here in New York, I couldn't even find butter. When a waiter at an American restaurant served me a small pat of butter, he made a grimace, letting me know that this was a great "favor."

No Butter, Small Piece of Beef Hung in Ham Window

It wasn't just butter. On Easter Sunday, "ham" was nowhere to be found in New York City. New York newspaper reporters Ferguson and Jardine co-authored an article: "Want Ham for Easter?" They said: Ham is gone now, not only can you (the reader) not buy it, but even we journalists can't buy it. "If you want to eat a little better, you can switch to fish, lamb, or chicken and duck."

"Beef is available, but you have to go through the black market. Beef merchants hang a small piece in the window with officially priced beef, but don't even think about it, it won't be your turn."

Thus, New Yorkers felt the pain. For five years, New York City averaged 1,627,851 pounds of pork consumed per week, and 6,607 cattle slaughtered. For a metropolis like New York, with nearly seven million people, this amount is absolutely essential. Now that both the Atlantic and Pacific wars have been won, New Yorkers have no meat to eat.

The Department of Agriculture knew this was an important issue, and two days before Easter, announced that 1,334,008 pounds of pork and 6,276 cattle would be shipped to New York during Easter week. Owen, a spokesman for the New York Fisheries Association, also announced that 750,000 pounds of fish would be supplied daily to New York City residents for consumption.

However, the people of New York were still dissatisfied. The New York Press Club recently issued a humorous notice, deciding to hold a dinner on the evening of April 25th at the Waldorf Astoria. They declared: "To comply with President Truman's instructions, the dinner will not include bread and butter, so as to conserve food for export." It is said that 1,600 news professionals will attend to support the "No Butter Movement." General Eisenhower will be one of the guests of honor.

Whether Ike will attend the Press Club's "grand occasion" remains to be seen. Anyway, the American people are extremely unaccustomed to the word "conservation." On a streetcar, a clerk told me: "If Americans were to talk about conservation, the war would have been lost long ago." Most Americans believe that only by frantically consuming can there be a large output.

Twelve People Strike, 100,000 Lose Milk

The reality is just like that. Not being able to buy things in the United States does not mean that there is nothing itself, things are there, but the system shackles it. To give a simple example: a few days before Easter, in the "South Side" area of ​​the East Coast of New York (once rumored to be near the new site of the United Nations), 100,000 people suddenly had no milk to drink because twelve milk foremen went on strike for failing to get a pay raise. Andrew, the director of the milk factory, refused to comply, so for several days, no milk was on the market. Most American babies grow up on milk, and this made many housewives very anxious. The New York Mirror put a large headline in the social news column: "Twelve People Strike, 100,000 Lose Milk!"

Even now, white sugar is still a rarity in New York. There is still a big disconnect between sugar production and consumption. Some time ago, the largest sugar factory, the "East Coast" Sugar Factory, had 4,400 workers strike for a pay raise. The East Coast Sugar Factory's production accounts for 70% of the entire United States. As a result, the Department of Labor rushed to mediate, and as a result, each worker received a wage increase of 15 cents per hour, and the problem was resolved.

The endless wave of strikes has not yet ended. The "Gold-Dollar Kingdom's" economic disorder is becoming increasingly severe. As a result, many social figures are looking for solutions, and finally, they believe they have discovered: "All evil lies in the Price Administration."

Republican Party Launches General Attack, Weicholt Fires First Shot

The Price Administration was a wartime production agency, one of Roosevelt's proud creations back in the day. Now that the war has ended victoriously, the Price Administration still exists. Because prices are managed, factory owners cannot arbitrarily raise the prices of finished products, and since factory owners cannot arbitrarily raise the prices of raw materials, workers naturally cannot arbitrarily raise their wages. As a result, workers strike, production decreases, and with reduced production, market supply is insufficient. Even if prices are restricted, "black markets" are inevitable everywhere. In this way, what was originally intended to manage prices for the sake of people's livelihood has resulted in making people's lives more difficult. The Republican Party has taken this matter as an important issue to attack the Democratic government, and after several meetings, launched a general attack in Congress.

The first to fire was Representative Weicholt of Michigan, who opposed extending price controls until the end of March next year. He said: Restricting prices will strangle production, and we can no longer let production decline. The slogan he put forward was: "Reasonable profit." "Why not allow capitalists to obtain reasonable profits while simultaneously raising workers' wages?"

On the same day, in the Senate's Economic and Financial Subcommittee, Republican Senator Taft of Ohio vehemently attacked the government's plan to stabilize finances and control prices, saying: "If I were in charge of price controls, I would give up two-thirds of the items and restore their freedom." He did not allow opponents to interrupt, and only allowed others to speak after he had finished speaking.

Chicago Has No Pork to Eat, Only Vegetables Can Be Used Instead

An Associated Press reporter telegraphed back to New York from Chicago, saying that Chicago had no pork to eat during Easter week. Butchers were unwilling to operate because of government price controls, and many housewives "replaced it with vegetables."

Chicago is the center of the American slaughterhouse market, and Chicago's problems were immediately reflected in Washington. Senator Combs, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, spoke about the lack of meat, saying that the only way to remedy the situation was to immediately lift controls.

At the Agriculture Committee seat, Mr. Schweitzer, the manager of the Chicago Beef Slaughtering Company, requested the lifting of controls, saying that during the week before Easter, the slaughtering company only received 185 head of cattle. This day last year, 4,103 head were purchased within the same week.

"Why? The government has restricted our purchase prices. We cannot raise prices to buy from farmers, so all the cattle went to the black market."

That day, at the meeting seat, Price Control Bureau spokesman Franken stated that the prices of all agricultural products were determined after consultation with Secretary of Agriculture Anderson. He admitted that agricultural products now have a black market, and the black market price is about 20% higher than the official price.

Price Control Chief Angrily Roars, Explains Prices and Currency

The most heated debate was still in the House of Representatives, where Price Control Chief Paul Porter personally explained the government's countermeasures in detail in response to market fluctuations, saying, "How could the government not know about these symptoms? But if there are no controls, prices will rise even more drastically. "Once prices rise, currency will inflate even more. Today, the United States already has a general inflation. If more and more currency is issued, people's lives will be unimaginable." He also seriously pointed out: Without price controls, only the interests of capitalists will be increased, while disregarding the interests of hundreds of millions of people.

Paul Porter pointed out that the current amount of currency in the United States has reached 225 billion US dollars. If price controls are lost for one year, then on this day next year, prices will rise by another 75%, or even 100%. By then, money will become worthless, and those who purchased wartime bonds, or deposited money in banks or insurance companies, will invisibly suffer damage from reduced purchasing power.

"Suppose I now propose in Congress that all private capital in the United States, including deposits, movable property, and immovable property, be taxed at a rate of 50% by the government. Some of you will definitely accuse me of being a communist or a madman." It can be seen that taxation is impossible. Since taxation is impossible, and price trading is free and unfettered, the result will inevitably increase the number of chips, inflate the currency, and eventually lead to people's livelihood becoming unsustainable.

Weicholt Insists on His Own Views, Allowing People to Freely Raise Prices

Paul Porter's speech was very somber and sincere. One congressman retorted him: trying to use price controls to contract the currency is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree.

Representative Wadsworth of New York State attacked price controls most fiercely. Democratic congressmen were divided into two factions, with Southern Democratic congressmen centered on agriculture expressing sympathy for the Republican Party, advocating opening up prices and raising agricultural product prices.

The House of Representatives' vote on the price plan was on Thursday of Easter week. The debate that morning was the most brilliant. Republican stalwart Weicholt shouted loudly: "Production first. Only production can save the current difficulties." He insisted on his own views: "The more controls, the worse. Therefore, there is only the abolition of controls, and the abolition of the government's 'subsidy policy' for the manufacturing industry." Weicholt said: "The government does not need subsidies at all, creating trouble for itself. Let industrialists and businessmen freely raise prices, and once prices rise, there will be enough production." Representative Langen of Massachusetts immediately stood up to support him.

Democratic Congressman Monroe opposed these views, shouting: "The dark ages for all American consumers have arrived." Republican Congressman Spencer reminded the House to pay attention: "An organized collective force is plotting to overthrow the Price Control Bureau, which is working for the welfare of the people. But you should pay attention to the 95% of the people in the country, who will support the control policy, even though they are an unorganized group today."

Another Republican Congressman, Crawford, who supported the control policy, pointed out that last year alone, American consumers saved 36 billion gold dollars because of the control policy.

The Speaker announced the vote, and the result of the vote was 259 votes to 137 votes. Weicholt's proposal won. Of the 259 votes, 171 were Republican, and 88 were Southern Democrats.

The content of Weicholt's proposal is: (1) The control period of the control bureau, which should have been extended to the end of June next year, is advanced by three months to the end of March next year for complete termination. (2) Each manufacturer and wholesaler may add a "legal profit" for sale as needed. (3) From July 1st, the subsidy policy for pork butchers will be cancelled, and pork prices will be opened up. (4) Other subsidy measures for various goods will be completely abolished by the end of this year. (5) The Price Control Bureau and the Factory Advisory Committee will discuss the steps to be taken after the abolition of price controls next year.

The media has two completely different views on this matter. One believes that from now on, the United States can return from the wartime economic system to a peacetime situation, which can promote prosperity. But most believe that this is a capitalist economic system "reversing course."

Washington Housewives Petition, Requesting to Retain the Price Control Bureau

The most affected are probably the small citizens of the city. With the Price Control Bureau in existence, even though there may be no pork to eat for a few days, it is still tolerable. In the future, if prices are allowed to skyrocket freely and currency inflates, life may become a big problem. On the day Congress met, hundreds of housewives in Washington petitioned in front of the Capitol, requesting to retain the Price Control Bureau and not allow capitalists to do whatever they want.

The New York "Afternoon Paper" drew a cartoon of a black-faced executioner strangling O.P.A. (Price Control Bureau), with many people next to it reaching out and shouting: "We need him!"

In addition, he also drew a sinister portrait of Weicholt, with the note below: "5% of the people overwhelmed 95% of the national public."

That evening, the authoritative economist, the current Director of Economic Stabilization, Chester Bowles, gave a broadcast on the American Broadcasting Corporation, beginning by saying: "I am preparing to resign." Then he said that this action by Congress would cause a major economic disaster in the United States, destroying the budgets of thousands of families. "In this coming year, millions of consumers in our United States will never have a comfortable day again!" He said, "Let us open our eyes and see what difficult consequences will be created."

This authoritative economist has his own set of views. A month ago, he wrote an exclusive article in the "New York Times," in which he analyzed from various aspects that the continuing inflation in the United States would be a hidden worry for the world economy, especially for the United States itself!

### London in Half a Year: A Casual Discussion of Current British Life

— Special Correspondent Xueyan's Airmail Report from Our Newspaper on the 23rd

When we, a group of students newly arrived in Britain, stepped ashore, the first inconvenience we encountered was the difficulty in buying matches. Those of us who smoked were the most anxious. Gradually, we discovered that more and more items were either unavailable or severely restricted in quantity, requiring queuing at restaurants and finding hotels fully booked, all indicating a scarcity of goods. We even began to suspect that London might be less affluent than Chongqing. Whenever we spoke with older British people, they would sigh and say, "Guang Sheng, you're a new visitor, aren't you? You don't realize Britain has been impoverished by the war! The wealth of the British has been spent on defeating the fascists."

Children Eat Bananas, Adults Swallow Saliva

For those with digestive issues, the first hardship is the complete unavailability of fruit. Long-term residents of London say they haven't seen fruit in six or seven years. Last year, the year of victory, several thousand tons of bananas were finally imported around Christmas, and radio and newspapers treated it as major news. However, the government later announced that the quantity was too small and could only be distributed to children for Christmas. Thus, adults could only watch and swallow saliva, while the children beamed with joy, telling everyone how many bananas they had eaten. Once, I joked with a British housewife, "You British are so strange; you don't seem to like fruit at all, as you can't find any in the market." She became genuinely upset and said, "Mr. H, you really know how to make fun of people. Don't you know Britain has been impoverished by the war? Things we used to take for granted every day, we now have to give up... I really don't know how disappointed Tommy (British soldiers) will be when they return. They won't believe this is their own country anymore. After fighting for others for several years, they come home to find their homeland impoverished to this extent." Her words were filled with a sense of loss for the past.

Greatest Sacrifice to Protect Justice

Before the war, Britain ranked first in the world in terms of foreign trade and overseas investment. But during the war, foreign trade completely ceased, almost equaling zero. Overseas investments were either destroyed by the enemy or mortgaged or sold. Therefore, compared to before the war, there is no doubt that Britain is now impoverished. So, regardless of what impression foreigners have of her, the British themselves unanimously believe that Britain has made the greatest sacrifice in this war, becoming impoverished in the fight to defeat fascism. They insist that they fought to defeat fascism, implying that Britain did not fight for its own interests but for the principle of justice, meaning that their sacrifices were for the protection of justice. Indeed, this belief of the British is evident everywhere.

Order Clothes in Winter, Wear Them in Summer

For someone arriving in Britain from India, the most immediate inconvenience is clothing. India is in the tropics, where a light-colored suit can suffice for winter. But Britain is in the north. London's latitude is the same as Manchuria's. Even in the height of summer, it doesn't get too hot. So, those arriving in Britain from India urgently need to acquire more clothing, and the problem is often quite pressing. But in Britain, buying clothes is heavily restricted. First, you need a ration coupon, and applying for and receiving one usually takes ten days to two weeks. Even if you get one, the quantity you can buy is limited, of course. But even if you just want to buy ready-made clothes, if you go to ten stores, seven or eight of them will have samples but no stock. It takes some effort to find anything. If your size doesn't fit and you need to have clothes custom-made, then you're really out of luck. Shopkeepers will all say, in unison, that there's a shortage of labor and it will take six or seven months to deliver the order. In other words, clothes ordered in winter won't be ready until summer. Imagine how difficult that is.

Banned Luxury Goods, Focus on Utility Items

Almost a year has passed since the end of the war in Europe, and the pressure of labor shortages in Britain has not eased. As a result, the quality of general goods has also declined universally. All luxury items that were available before the war are banned from production. The market is flooded with utility items that are practical and don't focus on style or aesthetics. Everything you buy is "Utility"—outerwear is Utility, shirts are Utility, wool is still Utility, furniture is Utility, stationery is Utility, and even radios are Utility. We, a group of poor students, are fine with it because the prices are cheap, and sometimes we even find the quality quite good. But if high-ranking officials from within the country, still remember the woolens and fabrics produced in Britain before the war, now they have long disappeared from the market. So, they ask around, run into walls everywhere, and look genuinely distressed. What we students find most problematic is the difficulty in buying books. During the war, due to paper shortages, the printing of both new and old books almost completely stopped, and even the print runs of newspapers and magazines were severely restricted. Ordering a copy of The Times requires waiting six or seven months. Buying a small Oxford dictionary requires searching dozens of bookstores, and you still might not find one. As for more specialized reference books, you'll have to run around even more. You might not be able to find a single suitable one after searching all over London.

Food is Rationed, Nutrition is Not a Concern

People coming to Europe worry about insufficient nutrition. We had heard this said in our own country and also heard rumors in India. Later, on the ship, the British soldiers we spoke with talked about the food shortages in Britain. We were somewhat uneasy. As the ship approached Britain, the ship used the broadcasting system to explain the current living conditions in Britain, generally saying that Britain had made significant sacrifices during the war, so life was still very difficult. The intention was to prepare the travelers and returning soldiers for what to expect in Britain so that they would not be too disappointed after arriving. Some students, prone to unnecessary worry, were even more disheartened after hearing this. But in reality, after arriving in Britain, things were not as difficult as we had imagined. The main foods are rationed. Each person receives about two pounds of milk per week, one or two eggs (uncertain), several pounds of meat, and enough sweets and canned goods to barely get by. If you still feel insufficient, you can go to a restaurant for a treat. So, although the menu is monotonous and the taste is not to our liking, there is no concern about insufficient nutrition. And everything that is rationed is cheap. People coming from our country for the first time can't help but be delighted and energized when they see such cheap things.

Rational Control, Everyone Benefits

If we only look at one aspect of Britain, we might suspect that Britain is truly impoverished to the bone. In reality, it's not quite like that. According to many British students themselves, it's not very accurate to just say that Britain is poor. Perhaps saying "poor but not distressed" is more reasonable. In fact, as a result of this war, although the standards of enjoyment for some people in Britain have inevitably decreased, the lives of ordinary people are more secure, more equal, and more rationalized because of the government's proper control. For example, before the war, milk and eggs could be bought anywhere, but not everyone could enjoy them regularly. On the other hand, now, because of rationing, everyone has the same rights, without exception. Utility items cannot be compared to the luxury items that were available before the war, but they are good enough for practical use. And they are cheap, so every household can afford to buy them. Even in terms of general prices, they have only risen by about two to three times during the five years of war. This is quite remarkable. Even in a country as abundant in resources as the United States, prices have risen faster than in Britain. So, speaking calmly, the control of prices in Britain can be said to be very effective. Most British people also consider it satisfactory. As for the reasons for the particularly effective control, the most important is naturally the ability to control the source of goods. Britain is an island nation, and all goods rely on overseas supplies. Since the government controls the means of transportation, it effectively controls the source of goods. Since the goods are in the hands of the government, distribution is naturally easier and more rational, and price control is naturally more effective. We can almost say that Britain is an ideal country for price control. Secondly, there is the thoroughness of the system. When the government wants to control a certain item, it makes a realistic estimate and plan in advance. We know that the price of each item is closely related to other prices. To implement effective control, you must first consider all the factors affecting prices, prepare thoroughly, and then implement them. The people act in accordance with the law, and everything goes smoothly, step by step, without any problems. Otherwise, there will be trouble everywhere. If you only rely on the temporary whim of a cabinet minister, ordering the chief of public security and the president of the chamber of commerce to suppress prices, the result will inevitably be ineffective and may even stimulate price increases. Finally, strict enforcement is also one of the important reasons for success. Under the rationing system, no exceptions are allowed. If one person can be exempt, the rest can follow suit. For example, the peacetime industry in Britain is now gradually recovering. Artificial silk stocking (Nylon) factories have begun to resume production. One day, Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth visited a factory. The factory gave them each a pair of stockings but at the same time asked them to hand over their ration coupons because the factory needed to recover a certain number of ration coupons based on the amount of raw materials and labor used. There was a quota, and no exceptions were allowed, even for the royal family. If the royal family could be exempt, why couldn't cabinet ministers be exempt? And so on, down the line, it would be difficult to find any more people who weren't exempt.

Black Market is Not a Topic of Conversation in Britain

Having said all this, some may ask, does Britain have a black market? My answer is straightforward: "Yes, but buying things on the black market in Britain is harder than buying things at official prices in our country." People arriving in London from our country always ask about the black market situation in Britain, as if they are more concerned than the British themselves. If you answer "very little," they don't seem satisfied. As for those returning to our country from Britain, they like to talk at length about the British black market, even more so. I had heard it several times when I was in our country. It is probably true that Britain has a black market, but we have been in London for almost half a year. Although I have seen news in the newspapers about punishing black market merchants, I have never witnessed a black market transaction. When students meet each other, they occasionally talk about the black market. Although everyone knows it exists, no one has personally experienced it. In fact, people in Britain rarely talk about the black market. In India, I often heard people talking about the British black market with great interest, showing that the black market is not a topic of conversation in Britain. People from black market countries are surprised by the lack of development of the black market business in Britain, so they inquire with particular zeal. A few people who came to Britain for a quick meeting and had to return to our country quickly were the most enthusiastic about black market investigations, but after investigating for a few weeks, by the time they were about to leave, they were still in the enthusiastic investigation stage and had not found any leads. So, I am even more convinced that the black market is not developed in Britain.

### The Bloody and Tearful Life of a Dancing Girl in Transition! "Pengchai Girls" in Hangzhou

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng's Airmail Report from Our Newspaper on the 4th

In Hangzhou, the loudspeakers are filled with Shaoxing tunes, but around the Lakeside area, melodies like "Flame of Love" and "Busy Singer" are scattered, flowing from the dance halls onto the streets. These are the new entertainment venues after the victory.

These dance halls have been opposed by local people. The Provincial Assembly once asked the government to ban dancing girls and prohibit the opening of dance halls. The reason is that since the advent of dance halls, many jealous disputes have been staged from time to time, and Hangzhou is a simple and beautiful city. If these morally corrupt things spread, wouldn't they tarnish the sanctity of paradise?

Abolish Dancing, Let the Dancing Girls Marry

A certain gentleman with a considerable position in Zhejiang once spoke to the reporter about dance halls and dancing girls. He did not advocate banning dancing girls and prohibiting dancing. He said, "Hangzhou is a world-renowned scenic spot. In the future, many Europeans and Americans will come to visit. If there are no dancing girls and dance halls, wouldn't that be disappointing? And dancing is indeed a legitimate form of entertainment. Do we still advocate that men and women should not touch hands?"

Each has their own reasoning. Some of the dancing girls in Hangzhou are indeed not very good, but dancing is not necessarily a heinous thing. The question of whether to abolish or retain them is indeed a current issue. The municipal government is still collecting dancing entertainment taxes, but the provincial government has specially sent personnel to study whether to ban them altogether. People in the provincial government have asked, "Should dancing girls be banned?" Someone replied, "What about their way out?" People in the provincial government said, "They can be allowed to marry!"

Eighty Dancing Girls, Four Dance Halls Announced

In Hangzhou, there are a total of four dance halls: one is the China Restaurant, on Yingzi Road; one is the West Garden, on Yingshi Road; one is the West Lake Restaurant, on Yanzhao Road; and one is the Jingu Restaurant, at the corner of Jincheng Hotel on Yanzhao Road. These four dance halls, China Restaurant has twenty-five dancing girls, West Garden has twenty dancing girls, Jingu has fifteen dancing girls, and West Lake has ten dancing girls. Roughly calculated, there are about eighty. Compared with Shanghai, it is really a small potato compared to a big yam. Among these four dance halls, the dance floor of China Restaurant is the largest, but it is far inferior to the Paramount, Lido, and Ciel Rouge in Shanghai, only equivalent to the larger dance floors in Shanghai coffee shops.

A Certain Boss, Called King Yama

The price of each of their dance tickets is 2,400 yuan, which is distributed as follows: 900 yuan for the municipal government's entertainment tax, 600 yuan for the dance hall, 300 yuan for the dancing girl's boss, and 600 yuan for the dancing girl. As above. The dancing girl's boss specializes in recruiting young girls, dressing them up, teaching them to dance, and then putting them on the market. The boss is male, and the dancing girls are very afraid of the boss. The China Restaurant has a boss whom the dancing girls call "King Yama." He owns more than half of the dancing girls in Hangzhou. People in the industry call him "Red Boss." These many dancing girls all speak Shanghainese. When asked, "Where is your home?" they always like to say "Shanghai." In fact, it is a question how many of them are actually from Shanghai. Their level of education is not very high. Generally speaking, they are mostly at the elementary school level. A few have some difficulty writing. Occasionally, one or two have a high school or middle school level. It is said that Bai Mengying, who recently went from Shanghai, has a high school level of education.

Pengchai Girls, Cannot Be Called Dancing Girls

I once talked to several dancing girls about the theory of dance. They stared blankly and didn't know what to say. They said, "We only know how to take one step with Pengchai." So they really cannot be called dancing girls, nor can they be called dancing partners, but only "Pengchai girls."

One dancing girl said: "We charge 600 yuan per table. The most popular dancing girl can sit at most six tables a night, which is 3,600 yuan. A month is only 100,800 yuan. Buying a pair of socks and a pair of leather shoes is almost gone. What benefits are there to speak of? Some people still have parents, siblings, to support. When there is no other way, they can only get close to the dance guests to get some benefits."

Another dancing girl said: "So and so was sleeping in a hotel when they encountered a room check. They asked what her profession was. She said she was a dancing girl, so they wanted her to perform a nude dance." "Another time, a group of people in uniforms ran into the dancing girl's dormitory and insisted that so and so accompany them out to play. If she didn't, they would take out their guns!" "So and so was slapped in the face by someone in uniform." "So and so was forcibly kept outside for several nights."

These dancing girls wear fashionable clothes and gold and diamond jewelry. But when you listen to them talk, they all have a sad story of being wronged. Dancing girls have become inferior girls today.

Common Covenant, Dancing is Not Prostitution

When the citizens of Hangzhou became very interested in the dance hall issue, the provincial and municipal women's associations organized a Dancing Girl Life Improvement Association for them, with the dancing girls themselves serving as director and deputy director, holding a life improvement forum once a week, and soon they will be trained.

I once participated in their forum. Their chairman was too shy to speak. Later, they discussed life issues, feeling that the income of 600 yuan per dance ticket was too little, and demanded an increase, otherwise they would strike. No strangers are allowed to come and go in the dancing girl's dormitory after one o'clock at night and before seven o'clock in the morning. The dormitory is too dirty and requires the dance hall to find a way to clean it to maintain hygiene.

The provincial and municipal women's associations also put forward a common covenant for the dancing girls, asking everyone to abide by it. The first article clearly states, "Dancing is not prostitution."

Willing to Work, Unwilling to Be a Dancing Girl

One young dancing girl said: "I would rather work, I don't want to be a dancing girl anymore, but hoping to get a job is also a difficult thing."

We visited their dormitory. A dozen people live in one room. The light in the room is not very sufficient. In the dimness, they hurriedly took out mirrors, dressed up, put on fashionable clothes, and forced a smile, preparing to go to the dance party. Before they put on makeup, everyone's face was yellow and gaunt, and their tired eyes that hadn't woken up showed their background.

They themselves are also saying that they want to respect the personality of dancing girls, but with limited education and while they are young, how can they withstand the temptation of the guests? Although some experienced dancing girls have also cheated the guests out of money, what is that compared to the selling of the soul? I once asked: What about the dancing girls with a high school education? They told me, "Sisters with a high school education are more open-minded, so they are more romantic!"

They have never thought about it, and probably dare not think about their future. Yes, they can marry! But who to marry? The dance halls in Hangzhou have evolved to this point, who should be responsible for this?

### Harvard University President Discusses American Education

[New York, U.S. News Agency, 5th] Harvard University President Conant recently published an article in the New York Times, raising the following questions:

Raising Various Questions

(1) In the future, should we aim to help every aspiring individual enter university? (2) If so, what methods should we use to determine who can attend university and who cannot? (3) Will there be an overabundance of four-year liberal arts graduates, creating a large number of unemployed individuals who harbor resentment towards the education system they experienced? Dr. Conant said, "After the American Soldier's Bill of Rights was announced, a large number of people will enter university. In a few years, the current emergency situation may disappear, but this abnormal development may affect long-term education plans. "I believe that one of the most sublime and important concepts in America is equality of opportunity, as it has been in the past and as it is now. This concept, on the one hand, is a changing and fluid social structure, and on the other hand, it is mutual respect among various professions and economic units. In short, there is absolutely no bias towards any class. In the past fifty years, the power of education has been advancing for America. As a result of expanding universal education to the high school system, it has created a powerful tool for American democracy. The closer we get to the goal of equality of opportunity (which, in fact, can never be fully achieved), and at the same time, the better our schools teach and implement the basic principles of American democracy, the more opportunities for individual freedom there will be."

Developing Public Education

Dr. Conant advocated developing public education in two directions: (1) Establishing more institutions similar to junior colleges, because most young people, after receiving two years of vocational training after graduating from high school, can handle many types of occupations. (2) Establishing a national scholarship system so that young people with special skills can be sent to vocational and higher education centers for study. Dr. Conant said, "In order to achieve these two goals, the government must spend sufficient education funds." He also pointed out, "For most Americans, whether a bright young person can receive education higher than high school depends on the family's economic situation. High schools in cities allow young people to obtain greater education with very little tuition, while young people in small towns and rural areas cannot enjoy this benefit. Only government funding can promote educational opportunities in small towns and rural areas."

Achieving Equality of Opportunity

Dr. Conant concluded, "The responsibility of guiding young people, which is extremely important, must not be ignored, because it is the cornerstone of a broad education system, the purpose of which is to achieve the principle of equality of opportunity. As we look forward to the future of education, we hope to improve the guidance system, expand public education, and develop our greatest national asset—children—in a wise manner, thereby strengthening our free society."

### University Professors in This City to Organize a Cooperative

### Out-of-School Youths in Northern Jiangsu Abandon Homes and Wander the Streets, Without Food or Shelter, Hoping for Sympathy and Effective Assistance from Society

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Refugee Alumni Association of Suhua Middle School recently published a statement addressed to prominent figures, stating: "Our alma mater, Suhua Middle School, was born in the early years of the War of Resistance and developed in the chaotic North Jiangsu. It has the characteristics of wartime education and a purely militarized character, which aroused the infinite hatred of the enemy, puppets, and bandits. It was destroyed once by the enemy, twice by the puppet army, and three times by the treacherous bandits. Our unyielding, benevolent, and loving principal, Mr. Zhou Huiyin, shouldered the responsibility of the school again and again, tirelessly leading us towards the path of resistance. Because of this, he was increasingly envied. Under the environment of the enemy, puppets, and bandits, he was finally kidnapped by the bandits, and all the school buildings and equipment were burned down. Although the incident was almost cruel, it further increased our understanding of the bandits and our determination to resist. Not long after, our principal escaped unharmed, and we looked up to him to continue leading us and cultivating us, but he was eventually summoned by General Tang Enbo, the commander of the current Third Front Army. From then on, we lost our reliance and became lost lambs. Last year, he returned with victory, but our classmates scattered in various counties of Northern Jiangsu were even more trapped in a tragic fate. If the treacherous bandits learned that we had studied at Suhua, they would first monitor us and then immediately persecute us. According to what we have seen and heard, as many as sixty or seventy people were brutally murdered because of this. This had to make us leave our parents, brothers, and sisters, abandon our lovely hometown, and embark on the road of deep exile. Now, there are no fewer than one hundred or so people gathered in Shanghai, some relying on relatives and friends, some wandering the streets, and even those without food or shelter, waiting for help. We not only look up to our principal to lead us, but also hope that people from all walks of life will show us sympathy and provide us with effective assistance, so that we will not go astray and become corpses on the road in a foreign land."

### Education Bureau Formulates Flexible Measures for the Qualification of Secondary School and Normal School Teachers

### Bond Market Returns to Old Nest Yesterday, Trading is Booming, Stock Market is Still Constrained by Credit

The official price implemented the return to the old nest activity yesterday, with a style that responded to the return of the capital. The industry was excited, and the buying trend was formed by the collection of scattered retail funds. Tong Bing opened at 6,300 yuan in the morning and then was raised to 6,800 yuan. The chips absorbed by the large households in the previous days were resold. Soon the market fell to around 6,150. At the beginning of the new opening, there were also those who seized the opportunity to maintain the price at a low level. At noon, it was still able to rise back to above 6,400 yuan. As a result, it continued to rise by 450 yuan compared with last Saturday. Tong Ding was flat, while Jia, Yi, and Wu each rose by 100 yuan. The Hua stock market was constrained by credit, and the industry was unable to do what it wanted. It did not escape the old tune of being stable at first and then weakening. The highest price after the morning opening was 5,350 yuan for Yongsha, 4,550 yuan for Meiya, 4,550 yuan for Jingfu, 365 yuan for Xinguang, and 318 yuan for Dongxing. After entering the market, the prices fell steadily. The noon prices were all low. Yongsha had the worst performance, with the low price reaching below 5,050 yuan. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongsha and Meiya fell very slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, Quanxing, Xinhuo, and Rongfeng fell by about half a percent. The remaining gains and losses were small. The veteran stocks were again sluggish, and the foreign stocks were unable to rise. Yisha saw 14,400 yuan when it first opened, but it was only a flash in the pan. Soon, it was forced by credit, and the bullish securities dealers could not last long. Gradually, the prices fell. At noon, compared with last Saturday, the hot and cold stocks continued to decline slightly.

### Gold and Currency are Both Weak

The market first stabilized and then weakened yesterday. It was reported that a large amount of gold was being shipped to Shanghai, and that the gold prices in Europe and the United States were much lower than in East Asia. Holders sold at high prices, causing the price to gradually fall from 1.66 million after the morning opening. After ten o'clock, it hovered below 1.62 million. The Bank of China allocated 281 bars, and the price was reduced to 1.6 million yuan. Market sentiment turned weak. In addition, the settlement of 500,000 trillion yuan for Zhongfang's yarn and cloth tightened credit a lot. At noon, it broke into the 1.6 million mark. At noon, it retreated to 1.575 million before it stabilized slightly. As a result, it fell back by 55,000 yuan compared with last Saturday. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops was 171,000, the price of silver was 1,700, and the price of silver dollars was 1,008. The interest rate in the gray market was still tight, and the interest rate was still at 20% or so. The U.S. gauze was loosened more than usual, and the cap was pulled from 710 yuan to 720 yuan and a few cents. The demand was relatively weak, and the actual goods were stuffed out. The process was not good. Nong opened at 2,330 yuan, first falling slightly due to the gold price, and then the supply of funds increased one after another due to tight credit. At noon, it was close to the 2,200 yuan mark. In the afternoon, it finally broke. As a result, it fell back by 100 yuan compared with last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars retreated from 445 yuan to around 430 yuan. As a result, it fell back by 5 yuan. Hong Kong Electric was 434, and Robbie was 540 yuan, all of which were supplied. The US exchange rate was also flat.

Fangjian Company sold a huge amount of 3,500 packages of Mitreling Brazilian flowers Paraguay three brands, Shenxin No. 2 Factory imported 400 packages of Paraguayan and Pengjiapo, and Xinyu and Sulun also had 200 packages of transactions each. Prices rose by 23,000 yuan. In addition, the US cotton telex reported a drop of 8 to 11 pounds. It is estimated that the near-term US dollar is 27.50, and the long-term US dollar is 27.62. The spot price of Metreling remains unchanged at 28.16 yuan.

### Customer Gang Transactions are Launched, Yarn Prices Rise Consistently

Yesterday, the yarn market saw another high rise. The reason was that the transactions of inland gangs came from the source, and the price of 20-count miscellaneous brand small and medium-sized yarns rose by 120,000 yuan. The Han Gang absorbed a lot of 42-count double-strand money, and the price rose by 230,000. However, because of the fatigue in Guangzhou, the Guang Gang had no intention to enter the market yesterday, so the upper body yarn such as Shuangma was slightly lower. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, from 1 to 100 counts, all colors were available. From 42 counts and below, each price was 30,000 to 80,000 higher than the previous period. Only 16 counts have not been offered for sale for half a month.

### The Silk Market is Still Weak and the Silk Goods Have Slightly Turned Around

Yesterday, the rayon market was still weak. 120-count Tianqiao opened at 1.44 million yuan, shouted 460,000 yuan, and closed at 1.42 million yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to be done, and it was 20,000 yuan less, which was 50,000 yuan less than the previous day. The price of 120-count beauty of miscellaneous brand was 1.5 million yuan, which was 100,000 yuan weaker than the previous day. There were still no transactions of factory-managed foreign goods. Hangzhou customers purchased ordinary five-dan goods for 1.7 million yuan, and another dan was reduced by 20,000 yuan. The transaction price of 　managed another dan was 1.32 million yuan. The silk fabrics of Meiya were slightly better by 120,000 yuan, and the Dacheng checkered crepe was 3,700 yuan, which had been done at 780 yuan. Because the silkworm season has arrived, the shipping volume of Hangzhou goods and Sheng goods is scarce, and the prices have been raised across the board.

### Coal Prices are Stable

The source of white coal was blocked due to labor unrest in the Haifang area. However, there were sporadic arrivals from Tianjin, and the inventory of white coal in Shanghai was abundant, so the market price remained stable. The foreign routes of bituminous coal dross have become less frequent, and the actual sales in Shanghai are also sluggish, and the market has reported another collapse. However, because the quantity of bituminous coal blocks distributed by the industry this time is very small, the market situation is still stable.

### Reduced Sugar List Prices

Yesterday, the sugar market was extremely mediocre due to tight credit and sluggish actual sales. The Association's listed prices for medium-grade white sugar initially were 60,000 yuan, then dropped to 59,500 yuan to 59,000 yuan. Another batch of sugar was put up for bid, consisting of 3.5 truckloads of white sugar, 1,600+ bags at 63,000 yuan. A small amount, 2,000 yuan, sold 666 bags. Raw sugar, 1,800 bags at 52,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,000 yuan, only 180 bags were sold. A certain company offered a batch of oil-paper wrapped goods, with expired tax bills, at a lower price. Coarse white sugar was priced at 72,000 yuan, 4.5 truckloads of white sugar at 85,000 yuan, Dutch Red at 90,000 yuan, and 合靑 [brand name] at 36,000 yuan. The goods were generally of inferior quality, and only a few hundred bags were sold. Dealers quoted 48,000 to 49,000 yuan for 刁靑 [brand name].

### Yesterday's Rice Market: Abundant Supply, Warm Weather – White Kernel Rice Recovers Slightly by 2,000

The rice market's sales remained sluggish. Supplies from the Sujia Road area were abundant. The weather turned warm, and people felt weak. Tongli white kernel rice fell by 2,000 yuan. Thick kernel, 客秈 [rice variety], Du 秈 [rice variety], and others also declined successively. However, White Yuan Sheep 秈 [rice variety] sold as soon as it arrived. The market situation was so-so. Flour supply and demand were balanced. Bran rose slightly by 100-200 yuan. Bean cakes saw slight inquiries for rural sales, rebounding by 200-300 yuan. In Shantou, goods from Qingdao flooded the market. Tianjin had a slight supply, but lacked the strength to rise. Local retail sales of soybeans were relatively robust, rising by 1,000 yuan. The arrival of raw peanuts was scarce, also increasing by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Red beans were similar. Corn was sluggish. Sesame was weak. Cotton cakes were stagnant. According to rice market news, yesterday's arrival in the city included seven types of rice, totaling over 5,900 piculs. The types and quantities of rice were as follows: White kernel rice 2,791 piculs, Thin paddy rice 853 piculs, Early rice 875 piculs, Sheep 秈 [rice variety] 141 piculs, Du 秈 [rice variety] 1,119 piculs, White Yuan 85 piculs, Yin Yuan 100 piculs.

[Central News Agency, this city report] The grain authorities' first phase of loans to grain merchants previously purchased and transported rice from rice-producing areas to Shanghai. The rice that has been sold on the market reached 9,678 piculs. The amount transported successively to Shanghai and stored in designated warehouses was 7,500 piculs. The amount stored in warehouses in the producing areas awaiting transport to Shanghai was as much as 9,000 piculs. It is said that the sales method will be discussed and determined once the review committee convened by the grain authorities is established.

### Jasmine Tea: Stockholders Hoarding and Not Selling

In recent days, tea merchants have been hoarding jasmine tea. This is because new tea will not be available for some time, and since the taste for old tea has improved, the market's inventory has been dwindling. Therefore, people are uniformly optimistic, creating a situation of supply falling short of demand. The market is stable and promising. As for other varieties, both local merchants and Suzhou merchants have been replenishing their stocks, and their base prices are solid. Currently, the African and Moroccan markets have a strong demand for special grade, small bud green tea. Unfortunately, due to transportation issues, no progress has been made so far. It is said that a certain foreign firm in this city plans to find a way to transship and sell it.

### Relaxation of Remittances from the Dutch East Indies

After negotiations between the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Dutch East Indies Foreign Exchange Bureau, this limit has been increased. According to authoritative sources, the first ship repatriating our overseas Chinese will depart on the 20th of this month.

### Sino-Indian Exchange of Goods: Bristles and Raw Silk Exchanged for Cotton and Tobacco

[United Press, New Delhi, 5th Dispatch] According to Ministry of Commerce officials who recently arrived here from Shanghai, China plans to purchase approximately one million bales of cotton from India (each bale weighing 400 pounds) because India currently has a surplus of approximately two million bales of cotton. In addition, China may also purchase 20 million pounds of tobacco from India. It is believed that India will import Chinese silk, bristles, and other products.

### New Taiwanese Rice Appears: NT$6 Per Jin

Taiwan has a mild climate, with rice planted twice a year. Early rice from Taiwan has already entered the market this year. However, due to a lack of rainfall, the harvest has been greatly reduced. Its market price is approximately NT$6,000 per 1,000 jin.

### Another Batch of American Cotton Arrives in Shanghai

The American Ship Transportation Company's "Topa Topa" arrived in port the day before yesterday, carrying 3,000 tons of cotton, totaling over 14,000 bales. Today, the "New Water" also arrived, carrying American cotton; the exact amount is unknown. The American Steel Company's "Rockland Victory" also arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday, carrying a large amount of cement, 34,000 bags, 100 bales of cotton, and 2,000 barrels of gasoline.

### Tianjin Bristle and Fur Exports Reach 2.3 Billion in Two Months

The Tianjin bristle and fur market is relatively weak. Exports to the United States in February and March suffered a setback due to non-conforming quality. Later, due to abundant arrivals, prices were impacted. According to statistics released by the Commodity Inspection Bureau, Tianjin's export figures for February and March were: February: Value of 1,004,266,334 yuan. March: Fur category: 103 cases, 104,534 pieces, total value of 244,573,600 yuan. Bristle category: 3,631 cases, 182,922 quintals, total value of 577,838,420 yuan. The total for February and March reached 2,335,433,884 national currency.

### Another Gold Mine Discovered in Canada

[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] Senator Thomas, chairman of a special silver committee, stated that a gold mine was recently discovered in northwestern Canada. Its ore contains 30 ounces of pure gold per ton, comparable to the recently discovered gold mine in the Orange Free State of South Africa. This discovery will once again make it possible to use gold as a world currency.

### Guangzhou Rice Prices Have Fallen Back Down

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th Dispatch] The city's soaring rice prices have rapidly declined due to criticism from the media and the authorities' multifaceted efforts. The wholesale price of top-grade rice today is 70,000 per 100 jin, and medium-grade rice is 63,000. This fluctuation is clearly a man-made phenomenon. All reporters in the city have decided to wage a full-scale war against the "man-made rice shortage" and to strike against those who manipulate rough prices.

### Textile Industry Power Conservation: Complete Shutdown from 6 PM to 9 PM

[Our Report] The city's power company's maximum power generation is 123,000 kilowatts, and the current usage has reached 118,000 kilowatts. As a result, all generators are operating day and night without rest. If there is any damage, there is a risk of interruption. Therefore, the power company has consulted with various factories to assist by temporarily shutting down during the peak power consumption period to regulate consumption. The textile industry has agreed to comply, deciding to shut down completely from 6 PM to 9 PM every day, without starting early or delaying. This will be implemented starting on the 13th of this month.

### Central Trust's 10,000 Bolts of Cloth to Be Auctioned Tomorrow

The former was entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for auction, and the latter was auctioned by the China Textile Corporation on the market. The Trust Bureau specially organized a committee to sell government materials and property as an agent, and is managing the matter. It is now known that the committee has allocated 10,000 bolts of cloth for auction, scheduled to open bids on the 8th. Currently, they are actively clearing warehouses and have decided to sell them off successively in the near future.

### Switzerland Trains Embroidery Workers

[United Press, St. Gallen, Switzerland, 5th Dispatch] The Swiss government has begun a program to train workers in the embroidery industry in order to increase production. Children of those who previously worked in the embroidery industry can receive training at government expense. Other young people can also enroll for training, but they must pay tuition.

### Orders Placed Before the End of February Allowed to Be Stored in Bonded Warehouses Awaiting Pickup. Applications for Ordered Passenger Cars Also Allowed.

The Jianghai Customs Import Management Office has been handling the registration of merchants dealing in five categories of licensed goods for over a month, and the list will be announced within days, with some having been eliminated. Regarding the application for licensed goods, the passenger car category, for private individuals, has been allowed to be handled in a flexible manner. Direct applications will be accepted first, without waiting for indirect handling by licensed merchants. This regulation stipulates that private individuals ordering passenger cars from abroad, with a value not exceeding US$1,200, and bringing them back personally, can submit an application to the office if they can provide proof. However, this is limited to one car that has already arrived in Shanghai.

Furthermore, there were rumors about five categories of licensed goods ordered before and currently en route to Shanghai, fearing confiscation due to being placed before the start of the application process. The office strongly refuted these rumors, stating that if the goods were indeed ordered before the end of February, they can be temporarily stored in customs warehouses. Once the licensed merchants are announced, they can be entrusted to handle the application according to law. Once approved, the goods can be picked up, and there will be no arbitrary confiscation.

### Japanese Wool Weaving Industry Recovering: Able to Export in Addition to Domestic Sales

[United States News Service, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] "New's Business Magazine" reports that the Japanese wool weaving industry has been able to maintain production because the occupation authorities have allocated military surplus goods for civilian use. The industry currently has 170,000 bales of wool. Most manufacturers believe that half of this raw material should be woven into pure wool fabric for export to foreign markets. The rest can be mixed with cotton or raw silk for domestic use. The planned export wool can be woven into 1.27 million pounds of fabric. If this fabric can be shipped abroad, the funds obtained can be used to purchase other raw materials needed by Japan. The other half of the wool, if combined with other fibers, can be made into 2 million pounds of finished products for domestic consumption. "Business Magazine" reports that the Japanese wool weaving industry currently has 480,000 spindles, compared to 1.38 million before the war. It is now planning to restore equipment damaged by the war. Wool weavers have applied to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers for approval to import 350,000 bales of wool, with one-third or one-fifth intended to be exported as finished fabric.

### US Wartime Assets Management Office Announces New Export Policy

[US News Agency, Washington, 5th Dispatch] The Wartime Assets Administration announced a new export policy on the 3rd of this month, aimed at facilitating the sale of surplus government machinery, tools, and other production equipment. The new policy will allow "qualified" machinery merchants holding genuine orders from foreign buyers to purchase in their own name and then transfer the goods to their overseas clients. This policy is expected to recover many foreign transactions lost due to transportation and funding difficulties.

### Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Jointly Forms Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon Loan Group: Detailed Measures Agreed Upon Yesterday

The loan for silk cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this year was previously approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury at a limit of 20 billion yuan. The China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, the China Trust and Postal Savings Bureau, and the Shanghai banking and money industry jointly formed a banking group to verify and issue the loans. Yesterday morning, representatives from the Four Banks Joint Treasury, the two bureaus, the Shanghai banking and money industry, and the China Silk Company met at the Bank of China Building on Renji Road to discuss the banking group's organization and matters related to loan processing. The main points are as follows:

(1) The attending representatives included Xu Guangdao, Chen Duo Ru, Ge Jingzhong, Diao Minren, Zhu Xuchang, Zhu Tongjiu, Pan Zhong, Wang Zishuang, Shen Shuping, Zhou Ji, Jiang Jinren, and others, totaling over ten people.

(2) The banking group organization will consist of one representative each from the China, Communications, Farmers, and Banks under the Four Banks Joint Treasury and the China Trust and Postal Savings Bureau, as well as four representatives elected from the Shanghai banking and money industry, totaling eleven people. The Loan Banking Group Committee will be formed, and the members will mutually elect three standing committee members. From the standing committee members, one person will be designated as the chairman, representing the banking group and presiding over the review, issuance, recovery, and related matters of the loan.

(3) The establishment date will be determined by the representatives from all parties and is scheduled for Tuesday to expedite work and save time. The location will temporarily be the Bank of China Building on Renji Road.

(4) The maximum loan amount is limited to 20 billion yuan, with the Shanghai banking and money industry accounting for 5 billion yuan. It is heard that over eighty institutions have participated on the banking and money industry side, and the allocated amount has been fully subscribed. The remaining 15 billion yuan will be shared by the five banks.

(5) The China Silk Company will lead the management organization, manage the use of the loans, allocate funds, and handle collateral. A loan management office will be jointly established by the banking group and China Silk Company. The main points are: (1) The banking group will manage the allocation, receipt, and payment of funds, while China Silk will supervise the allocation of loan use, manage cocoon processing, and calculate cocoon prices. (2) A general office will be established in Shanghai, and branch offices will be established in the cocoon-producing centers of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, with resident auditors stationed in each cocoon-collecting silk factory.

(6) The loan standard will be based on the number of silk reeling machines actually operating in each factory and will take into account production efficiency, power, cooking, and inspection equipment. Each silk reeling machine will be standardized based on the purchase of 3 to 12 piculs of dried cocoons. Loans to each factory will be limited to 70% of the actual need, with the remaining 30% to be self-financed by the manufacturer.

(7) The use of the loan is limited to (1) the price of purchasing fresh cocoons, (2) the opening of cocoon shops and drying costs, and (3) the cost of storing dried cocoons. The applicant manufacturer will fill out an application form, which will first be approved by China Silk and then sent to the banking group for discount processing. Each factory will negotiate a discount agreement according to the approved amount, and issue term bills according to the needs of cocoon collection, with proper guarantees, for discount to the banking group.

(8) The Bank of China's funds have already been disbursed. The cocoon collection must begin immediately. Before the funds are fully collected, it has been decided that the Bank of China will temporarily advance the funds and then transfer them to the banking group.

### Relying on Seniority and Selling Old Age

— Cheng Tie'an

I overheard someone expressing the "China is Good" theory:

He said: "Chinese things have permanence. The Xi'an stone tablet, the most recent one, is already more than 1,200 years old, and the inscribed words are still very clear. The ancient bronze bell in Guangxi, a relic of the Qin and Han dynasties, still rings very loudly when used as an alarm bell..."

"Chinese rosewood furniture, as long as it is well maintained, becomes more and more beautiful with use."

"When Chinese soldiers march, they are already exhausted when they are still far from the battlefield, but when they reach the front line, they achieve surprising results."

China has suffered from the disadvantage of "relying on seniority and selling old age." Believing that it is a cultural country with thousands of years of history, it can be as solid as a rock. While others are running forward, it still stands still, boasting of its "old age."

Let me tell you: "Now is not the time to 'sell old age'."

Special Feature

### Sun Temple

— Lü Changzui

Sun Temple, such an unfamiliar place name, of course, not many people know about it. Even some people who know about it will think that this is a place not worth mentioning.

This unfamiliar and unworthy place, now if I don't specifically introduce it, I think that in the future, I'm afraid that few people will care about it. Because the people who live here, like me, who know a few characters, are simply very few. Even some people who know a few characters are breathing and sweating all day long for the sake of life, and they don't even have the leisure for defecation and urination. It is absolutely impossible to ask them to remember the things of Sun Temple. Now, because I have stopped my business and have energy that no one wants, I sit in the thatched cottage with nothing to do, so I use this free time to briefly introduce the situation of our Sun Temple.

Sun Temple is a part of Zhabei. The first railway bridge after the train departs from the North Station is the jurisdiction of this area. The characteristic here is that there are no foreign houses like those along Linsen West Road, and tiled houses are rarely seen. They are mostly thatched cottages that you have to lower your head to enter.

Sun Temple should be a place where you can see the sun every day, right? The sun may be there every day, but we who live in Sun Temple are indeed far from seeing the sun. Most people have to go to the factory gate to wait for work before dawn. People who come out of the factory with a body full of fatigue, once they enter the thatched cottage, fall asleep without even taking off their clothes.

It would be terrible if the people who live here were to think about the preciousness of the sun. But if they really understood the preciousness of the sun, they wouldn't come to live in Sun Temple. However, when it has been raining for a long time, the road has turned into mud, making it difficult to walk, and the house is so damp that it becomes moldy, and even breathing is difficult, they also hope that the sun will come out, dry the road for easy walking, and drive away the mildew in the house for good sleep.

Among the residents here, those who sell their energy in factories along Xiaoshadu and Guojia Ferry account for the majority, followed by rickshaw pullers.

People generally think that those who sell their energy and pull rickshaws are mostly from Jiangbei. In fact, this is not the case. Although a considerable proportion is indeed from the Jiangbei area, there are also many from other places. They often carry the property of their entire family in batches and walk to Shanghai. My house has no "gold bars," so most of them gather here. As soon as they arrive here, in less than three days, a new village is found in the open space. The prosperity of Sun Temple depends entirely on these refugees who come from far and wide.

Sun Temple is also a place that people look down upon the most, because it is a slum—a refugee or beggar settlement. People with slightly neater clothes are reluctant to come here, supposedly because they are afraid of getting infectious diseases. Even passengers sitting on the Shanghai-Nanjing or Shanghai-Hangzhou trains rarely don't feel disgusted when they see the thatched cottages in this area. Some foreigners who come to China for the first time look around with contempt and curiosity.

It is true that if you take a train westward, after leaving the North Station, you will see a long cement wall five or six li long next to the railway tracks. At first, I didn't understand what it was built for. Later, a friend told me, and I suddenly understood: it turned out that it was more than ten years ago. Some wealthy people felt uncomfortable when the train they were riding passed through Sun Temple. They thought that the train should not pass through places where you can see these unsightly thatched cottages. Especially since entering the gate of Shanghai by land, the first thing you encounter is a messy pile of thatched cottages. The locals don't care when they see it, but when foreigners see it, it not only spoils the scenery of Shanghai, but also tarnishes China's reputation. At first, they advocated completely demolishing it, but then they changed their approach and built this cement wall to separate the railway from the Sun Temple area. Unfortunately, because of this war, many places have been destroyed, and you can still see the truth of the other side from the gaps in the train.

We don't have street lights here. In fact, we don't need street lights. Some people are even afraid of seeing firelight at night. There are also no newsstands. There are very few literate people, and no matter what major events happen in the country, the news will not reach here. Extra editions or evening newspapers never come here to call for subscriptions. There are probably no more than two telephones, so when a fire starts, the fire truck won't come until the sky is red.

Sun Temple can also be said to be an area without chickens or dogs. Chickens will disappear before they grow up; even stray dogs from outside are considered lucky if they can survive for more than an hour after entering this area. However, there are quite a few pigs, and they are treated very well, living in the same house as people.

In the early morning, you can often find newborn babies wrapped in tattered cloth bags by the roadside. Some are already dead, while others are still alive, waiting for stray dogs to end their lives. If infants had consciousness, in a world like this where you can't see the sun, I think they wouldn't want to linger.

### "Feet on the Ground"

— Chen Shan

According to a person from Province B, the lives of university professors in the interior are really miserable now. Their income is low, their expenses are high, and they have no choice but to find side jobs: they ask their wives to farm and act as cooks. For example, if she is from the Lower Yangtze region, she can cook some Lower Yangtze dishes and make some snacks for sale. Some even ask their children to go to the streets to peddle them. At first, everyone was embarrassed and didn't dare to do so openly, but later, life forced them too hard, and they really had no choice. So, they acted in unison, and there was nothing rare about it.

There is an old professor who is a scientist and has been studying biology and teaching for decades. When people see him, they always jokingly say to him: You really have "feet on the ground." He actually accepts it without shame. It turns out that the soles of the leather shoes he wears are already badly damaged, but he doesn't have the money to buy new ones, and he is still enthusiastically studying biology while wearing those old, broken leather shoes.

### Allergies and Heredity

— Chong Fan

Allergies are related to heredity. Dr. Longs, an American expert who studies allergies, says: People have a tendency to develop allergies due to heredity, but the symptoms vary from person to person and are not consistent. If both parents have a certain allergy, the child often shows signs of heredity before the age of ten; if one of the parents has a certain allergy, the child often shows signs of heredity after the age of ten. However, sometimes even if both parents have a certain allergy, the child may not show any signs of allergy, so Dr. Wan Longs says that physiology is ever-changing.

### "Washing the Face but Not the Neck"

— Shui

People wash their faces for cleanliness and beauty.

According to the rules: the face and neck are connected, and both are exposed outside the collar. Therefore, when washing, one should wash the neck and ears together to be beautiful and clean. However, many people are careless and only care about the appearance, so they just wash their faces with a few strokes and finish hastily. As a result, the 'face' is very beautiful, but what about the neck? It is ugly with a "dark and shiny" appearance.

Therefore, the people in my hometown once called it "washing the face but not the neck."

Originally, this kind of rude saying is very common and will not surprise people, but if you think about it carefully, it is a satirical remark that "although the language is humorous, it contains a very deep meaning."

If you don't believe me, I'll tell you two answers here:

First: When I was studying in middle school in Baoding, the principal always said this during every memorial week or when he convened student self-government officials to give instructions: Young people should not be perfunctory or cheat in their work, and they should be down-to-earth and thorough, especially not just scratching the surface. For example: if you have done a good job in your lecture rooms and dormitories, you should also make your toilets, dining halls, and kitchens tidy and clean. Otherwise, it will be like the saying in the countryside: "Washing the face but not the neck."

Second: General Feng Wangxiang's strict military discipline is well known to everyone. In the past, when he inspected the cleanliness of the barracks, he always looked at the toilets and warehouses first, and he didn't go to the lecture hall or the barracks. What's the reason? He said: "Rouge and powder are always applied to the face. The lecture halls and barracks are guaranteed to be: the quilts are folded like square tofu, and the guns are arranged like fish scales, so neat and clean, but what about the toilets and warehouses? They must be done perfunctorily. Therefore, I would rather not go to the lecture hall and barracks, but I cannot but go to the toilets and warehouses." Because the importance of these two places is comparable to the lecture hall and barracks, and they are classified as one category.

Therefore, General Feng often encouraged his subordinates with the following colloquialism: "This kind of thing is just like people washing their faces. Suppose your face is washed white, but your neck is dark and shiny and not washed at all. As a result, when your black neck is discovered, your beautiful face has been uglified by the black neck. At that time, no matter how beautiful your face is, what's the use! Isn't this just like the saying: "Washing the face but not the neck"?"

I hope all officials and ordinary people, high and low, big and small, throughout the country, please ask yourselves whether you are also committing this "washing the face but not the neck" problem?

### The Days of Suffering are Over

— Yang Mou

When Japan surrendered, friends met and sincerely congratulated each other: "The days of suffering are over." But a new gloom enveloped the entire continent, and everyone was worried that the ominous omen was like a storm about to break out over the mountains.

Now that the Kuomintang-Communist truce order has been issued, this time we should really congratulate each other: "The days of suffering are over." Victory brought us the end of destruction, and unity brought us the beginning of construction.

Opening up the modern history of our country, it is truly a page condensed with blood and tears. Internal troubles and external aggression, natural disasters and man-made disasters, have never stopped for a moment. Now it can be regarded as a complete write-off, and we must rebuild our paradise on the ruins!

The days of suffering are over! We are delighted! However, we must be extra persevering, hardworking, and strive hard to ensure that we will not have a second day of suffering!

A great era has already begun before us. The motherland needs us to pour blood and sweat into the earth to cultivate beautiful and brilliant flowers. Listen! The motherland is calling us!

The days of suffering are over! But this will never allow for complacency and selfishness. In the past eight years, the blood and sweat of many martyrs have laid the foundation for the motherland. Now, now it is time to grow leaves, bloom flowers, and bear fruit!

We are born in this era, and we should be glad for ourselves.

### Ticket Vending Machine

— Fang

Major train stations in the United States will soon adopt a new type of ticket vending machine. The machine prints and sells tickets automatically, which is very fast. Passengers buying tickets do not have to crowd and wait, and station staff will not be in a rush.

It is said that this machine is not a new invention. It was designed and manufactured by an Englishman one hundred and fifty years ago. European countries have used it for many years, but the American version has been slightly improved. The size is similar to a cash register, and it can print one hundred different station names. The printed ticket is two inches square, with the origin and destination, date, fare, number, and other instructions.

### Eradicating the Welcoming God Festival

— Shen Zhensheng

Every year on the Buddha's Birthday, rural areas universally hold a kind of welcoming God festival. Although this kind of welcoming God festival is enough to waste money and damage property, in the countryside, whether superstitious or non-superstitious, everyone is excited and happy to support this welcoming God festival. The reasons can be attributed to the following:

(1) Superstition - believing that the power of gods and Buddhas can be used to drive away human epidemics and plant epidemics.

(2) Adjusting the spiritual nature - rural areas are busy all year round and have no place to adjust the spirit, so they have a fair and play during the bright spring and fragrant flowers.

(3) Showing off nature - since the outbreak of the war by the Japanese invaders, how many people have made a fortune from the national crisis? They have both the idea of seeking protection from gods and Buddhas and the idea of showing off, so they spend a lot of money to support this welcoming God festival. Based on the above three reasons, even when the cost of living is extremely high and everything is required to save costs, the welcoming God festival is exceptionally lively.

After we understand the cause of the welcoming God festival, we know that it is useless to use pure forced prohibition, and we must use the following fundamental cure methods:

(1) Improve the culture of farmers, so that they know that the mysterious magic power of gods and Buddhas has long lost its value in this era of scientific advancement.

(2) Establish rural entertainment venues, rural libraries, rural tea gardens and other proper recreational places.

(3) Demolish improper temples and rebuild rural entertainment venues and other public welfare places, so that farmers lose their superstitious dependence and know that mysterious magic power is unreliable. The above three methods are the fundamental cure for the welcoming God festival. If they can be implemented according to law, not only can the trend of the welcoming God festival be eliminated, but it is also a necessary step in rural construction. I hope that the society will reach a consensus and jointly participate in this grand event.

### Based on Scientific Standpoint to Explain the Efficacy of DDT

Letter from the Research Institute of China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory

To the Editor:

Having read the DDT automatic spray bomb advertisement published by the manager of Haisheng Company in your newspaper on April 24, in which it says "Each room only needs six to eight seconds," according to a scientific standpoint, the following should be added: (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for six to eight seconds in a twelve-square-foot room to deal with flies, mosquitoes, and other smallest flying insects. (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for forty-five to sixty seconds in a fourteen-square-foot bedroom to deal with fleas. (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for forty-five to sixty seconds to deal with ants. (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for fifteen to twenty seconds to deal with moths. (1) The spray bomb needs to be sprayed for thirty to forty-five seconds to deal with bed bugs.

The above refers to the time of spraying. As for the time for insects to be poisoned to death, mosquitoes and flies will die within half an hour, bed bugs will die within a few hours, and cockroaches will die within a week. I hope that you can publish this so that the people of the country can have a deeper understanding of the use of DDT.

Sincerely,

The Research Institute of China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory

### Answers to Readers

Li Deming asked (1) I have been responsible for all the living expenses of my late parents for seventeen years. My late father has been dead for eight years, and I am still supporting my late mother. Does my late mother have full power to sell the property? (2) Is the power of attorney to sell the house signed by my late mother at the instigation of Bing legally valid? (3) I am unable to publish the denial of the sale in the newspaper. Is it legally valid to send a registered letter to the buyer (Yi) stating the denial of the sale for future negotiations? (4) The house is in Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu. Last November, I filed a lawsuit with the current organization (please note this point) denying the sale, but it was not resolved reasonably. Now the situation in the area is special and there is no way to negotiate. Is it effective to file a lawsuit with the formal court again in two or three years to recover the property rights? (5) On what date was the Executive Yuan's order "The transfer of land during the period of the occupied territories is generally invalid according to law" published in the newspaper? Does this order apply to this house? Please answer the above five questions.

Lawyer Zhu Yakui answered (1) The inheritance must be jointly owned by all the heirs. Without the consent of all the joint owners, the disposal is invalid. (2) If it is not your intention (proof is required), you can request to revoke it. (3) It can also be effective. (4) It can be effective. (5) It cannot be applied unless it is forced to sell by relying on the power of the enemy puppets.

Liu Linqi asked My wife claimed to be going to work in another port from her parents' home in the countryside in the spring of the 28th year of the Republic of China. She has not returned for seven years and there is no news of her. I have repeatedly asked people to inquire with her parents, but they all shirk responsibility and do not know, and there is no satisfactory answer. I have decided to divorce her. Where should I appeal? What legal procedures should I go through? Please advise.

Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied Anyone who has been missing for more than three years may request a divorce. You can sue with the local court or the local county government that also handles judicial matters.

Li Zhenyu asked I lent a friend 2,000 yuan (counterfeit money) in the 29th year of the Republic of China, stating that the annual interest rate was two points. Later, because I repeatedly urged him to pay back the money, he only paid the interest. He only returned the money in the 34th year. If the price of goods in the 29th year is compared with the price of goods in the 34th year, then I obviously suffered too much loss. However, because the counterfeit court at that time did not have the precedent of compensating according to the price ratio, I had to endure the pain and accept it. Now there are two questions: (1) I don't know if there is any current law that uses the price (or cost of living) as the ratio of compensation? (2) I have already received the original amount of the loan. I don't know if I can apply for compensation according to the ratio?

Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied Since you have already received the principal and interest, you cannot raise objections now.
