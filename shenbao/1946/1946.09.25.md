### Chairman Chiang Inspects Construction in Southern Jiangxi; Arrives in Ganxian Yesterday with Wang Lingji and Others; Instructs Party and Youth League Work in Nanchang Before Departure

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 24th] Chairman Chiang flew to Ganzhou on the morning of the 24th. When passing through the urban area of Nanchang on the way to the airport, he abandoned his Shanghai-registered "11432" sedan and instead stood in an open-top jeep of the Gendarmerie Regiment. He waved his hat and nodded to the thousands of citizens standing along the road to bid farewell with extreme reluctance, and responded with a smile. From the Provincial Government to the airport, cheers thundered. When the car arrived at the airport, leaders from all walks of life and representatives of the people and elders stood in a solemn formation to greet him. The Chairman got out of the car, shook hands with them one by one, and said thank you. Before reaching the Madame Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, he bid farewell to the well-wishers again and then walked slowly onto the plane. In a moment, the engine started, and the plane slowly rose into the air. The Chairman waved his hand from the window to express his gratitude. Those accompanying him included Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji, Chiang Ching-kuo, Yu Chi-shih, Cao Shengfen, Shen Changhuan, and Cai Mengjian, the Director of the Jiangxi Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It is reported that the Chairman does not intend to stay in Ganzhou for long and will fly to Guangzhou for inspection.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 24th] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the construction of Jiangxi. He took a special plane with Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji at 10:15 AM on the 24th to fly to Ganxian to inspect the new construction in southern Jiangxi. Chiang Ching-kuo, who had served as the Administrative Commissioner of southern Jiangxi for many years, flew here at 9:05 AM to greet him. Before his departure, the Chairman inspected the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Youth League branch headquarters, and gave some instructions on the work of the Party and the Youth League. He then took a green jeep to the airport, driven by Li, the Commander of the Eighth Gendarmerie Regiment. As they passed through the streets, thousands of people lined the roads to bid farewell. Seeing the Chairman's demeanor, everyone was overjoyed and shouted, "Long live the leader!" When the jeep was about to enter the airport at around 10:00 AM, the Chairman got out of the car. Many people from all walks of life in the provincial capital, including the Party, government, military, elders, and the masses, were already waiting respectfully at the airport. The Chairman walked into the airport, frequently nodding to the well-wishers to express his gratitude. He then shook hands with elders such as Ouyang Wu. At the door of the plane, he waved his hat to say goodbye to the well-wishers again. The special plane took off southward at 10:15 AM and was expected to arrive in Ganxian at around 11:00 AM. It is also reported that the Chairman inspected the Jiangxi Civil Affairs Department yesterday morning and instructed Li Yingchang to work hard and assist Chairman Wang in building a new Jiangxi to make it a model province.

[Another Dispatch] After smiling and bidding farewell to over a thousand well-wishers from all walks of life in Jiangxi on the morning of the 24th, the Chairman flew to Ganzhou, arriving at Ganzhou Airport at 11:30 AM. The people of Ganzhou were as enthusiastic as those in Nanchang upon hearing of the Chairman's arrival. After resting briefly in Zhongzheng Park, the Chairman walked to Yangming Academy with Chiang Ching-kuo and others at 4:00 PM to pay tribute to the relics of this generation of philosophers. The people surrounded and cheered along the way, and did not disperse for a long time. The Chairman then went to Bajingtai to view the confluence of the Zhang and Gong rivers, admiring it for a long time. He then crossed the river to Hugang to visit the Children's New Village and Zhengqi Middle School. Over a thousand children from the New Village and students from Zhengqi Middle School greeted him with gongs, drums, and firecrackers. The Chairman responded with a smile and often summoned Director Xu Changlin to inquire about the organization of the village and the children's studies. He praised the village's excellent management and good order.

### Chief of General Staff Chen Invites Envoys to Dinner; Gui Yongqing and Pi Zonggan Also Visit; Rumors Say Government Agrees to Consider Resumption of the Three-Man Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Political negotiations seem to be awaiting Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing before making progress on the surface, but there are also some signs that the government seems to have another shift, or is considering the Communist Party's attitude under some kind of tolerance. On the 24th, the only action was that Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Gui Yongqing visited Ambassador Stuart at 5:00 PM. Around 6:00 PM, Pi Zonggan, a military advisor to the National Government, and Rao Baisen, who arrived in Nanjing from Beiping at 2:00 PM, arrived at the American Embassy one after another to visit Ambassador Stuart. At 7:30 PM, Ambassador Stuart accepted the invitation of Chief of General Staff Chen, accompanied by his personal advisor Chuan Jingbo, to attend a dinner. Yu Dawei and Zhang Lisheng also attended. It is widely believed that this kind of movement may be an indication that the government representatives are conducting research on the military three-man meeting before the Chairman returns to Nanjing.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 24th] According to those around Ambassador Stuart Leighton, Pi Zonggan informed Ambassador Stuart this afternoon that Chairman Chiang had responded to the Chinese Communist Party's request and was considering the possibility of convening a three-man group meeting. This is a new concession from the government to avoid the final failure of the current negotiations.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Chinese Communist Party stated today that unless Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Leighton obtain a ceasefire guarantee from Chairman Chiang, peace talks will remain stalled. Zhou Enlai is still in Shanghai, waiting for the government or the U.S. side to promise: (1) an immediate ceasefire order, or (2) the convening of a three-man group meeting to discuss a comprehensive ceasefire. Wang Bingnan, a spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party, stated that Yan'an has abandoned its unconditional ceasefire proposal, saying that the three-man group must decide on the conditions for a ceasefire. Wang also said that Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall had promised to "try" to achieve a ceasefire once the Chinese Communist Party joined the political agreement. The Chinese Communist Party wanted to replace the word "try" with "guarantee," saying that based on past experience, promises are not enough and there must be a guarantee.

### Zeng Qi to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month

Believes Situation Will Not Drag On for Long

[Our Report] Zuo Shunsheng told reporters that Zeng Qi is still in Beiping and will probably arrive in Shanghai around the end of the month. Li Huang should be able to arrive in Shanghai today.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] The Beiping City Party Headquarters held a tea party at the headquarters' auditorium on the afternoon of the 23rd to welcome Youth Party leader Zeng Qi. Zeng attended with Liu Dongyan, a member of the party's Central Committee. After Chairman Wu Zhuren delivered a speech to introduce him, Zeng rose to speak. First, he described his inspection of the Northeast, witnessing the grand scale of the enemy's construction, all of which relied on China's manpower, materials, and financial resources. This further demonstrated China's vast territory and abundant resources. If China could be determined to engage in construction, it would not be difficult to realize Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan and the points listed in Chairman Chiang's "China's Destiny." However, the construction achievements since 1935 have been unsatisfactory. The reason is that China has been plagued by constant wars and political turmoil. The clearing of internal strife depends on a sound and feasible constitution, because once the constitution is established, the country's affairs will have a fixed track to follow. Next, he talked about the Youth Party's ten principles of nationalism, democratic politics, and social policy, and its three characteristics: constructiveness, independence, and comprehensiveness. Therefore, since its establishment 23 years ago, it has not had any shocking actions. However, after more than 20 years, it can still stand independently, which is because the party meets the needs of the objective environment. Zeng finally emphasized that the people of all countries in the world are tired of war, and the Chinese people are particularly eager for governance. Therefore, although the current situation is bleak, it is absolutely impossible for the war to drag on for long. He believes that light will arrive within a year and peace can be achieved. Zeng is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 24th.

### Direct Nanjing-Hangzhou Train; Nanjing-Shanghai Jining Train to Be Added

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has decided to launch a direct Nanjing-Hangzhou express train on October 1st. It will also add a "Jining" express train between Nanjing and Shanghai, departing from Shanghai every morning and returning to Shanghai on the same day.

### Retrofitting of Lightweight Express Train Successfully Tested on the Beiping-Hankou Railway

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 24th] The retrofitting of a lightweight express train on the Beiping-Hankou Railway has been successfully tested. It only takes 16 hours from Hankou to Zhengzhou, which is about 10 hours less than an ordinary train.

### Rumors of Abolishing Two Sections of the Ministry of Finance's National Treasury Department

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] There are rumors that the fourth and eighth sections of the Ministry of Finance's National Treasury Department will be abolished, and the number of personnel laid off will reach 58.

### Three Committees of the National Defense Council Hold Meetings for Several Days

Discussing Payment of Pre-War Deposits in Detail

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Economic, Financial, and Legal Committees of the Supreme National Defense Council have been holding meetings since the 23rd. It is reported that they will conduct the most detailed study on the payment of pre-war deposits. The discussions are still ongoing all day on the 24th, and will be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval after a decision is made.

### Price of Gold Bonds Fluctuates in the Capital

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The price of gold bonds in Nanjing fluctuated on the 24th due to rumors of the exchange rate being allowed to float for a long time and the rise in Shanghai. The US dollar was purchased at 3,800 and sold at 4,000, an increase of 200 yuan compared to the 23rd. The price of gold ingots remained stable, with the highest price being 240,000, an increase of 6,000 yuan.

### Postal Rates to Be Adjusted; Losses Exceed 10 Billion Yuan Last Month

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to those familiar with the postal situation, the postal bureau has recently suffered huge losses. Last month, due to adjustments in treatment and other reasons, the total deficit exceeded 10 billion yuan. Although there are government subsidies, it is not a long-term solution. Therefore, increasing postal rates is necessary. However, the adjustment of postal rates is different from the price increase of other public utilities, because postal rates are stipulated by the Postal Law. If there is an adjustment, it must first be approved by the Legislative Yuan or specially approved by the highest standing bureau. The timing is expected to be around November. However, it is also possible to adjust using methods such as increasing surcharges, or adding first and then adding retroactive recognition. As for how much the postal rate will increase after the adjustment, it is currently unknown. However, according to cost calculations, the price of ordinary letters must be increased to 400 yuan or 500 yuan to make up for it. The actual increase in the future may not be so high.

### People of Baxian County, Sichuan, Jointly Celebrate Chairman's Birthday

Will Present a County Map Carpet

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] In order to congratulate Chairman Chiang on his 60th birthday this year, the people of Baxian County specially ordered a carpet from the China Wool Weaving Factory with a map of Baxian County painted on it to present to the Chairman to commend his achievements and express their gratitude, and as a permanent memorial. The carpet has now been made and is on public display in the Baxian County Council. It will be transported to Chongqing for one day of exhibition before being sent to Nanjing by special commissioner.

### Government to Issue National Assembly Convocation Order on October 2nd

Election Office Urges All Parties to Submit Lists Quickly

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The National Assembly Election Office officially issued a notice on the morning of the 24th urging all parties to submit lists. The notice was signed by Zhang Lisheng, as he is the person in charge of the office. The notice requested that all parties submit lists in early October, and the government will officially issue the convocation order for the National Assembly to be held on November 12th on October 2nd. The reporter then interviewed people from various parties separately. The Youth Party said that Zeng Qi has not yet arrived in Nanjing, and there are no other representatives staying in Nanjing.

Liang Shuming of the Democratic League said: How can a meeting be held in such a chaotic situation? The Democratic League will not consider the National Assembly and will formally reply to the government's political consultative conference representatives. Liao Chengzhi, a spokesperson for the Communist Party, said: We will reiterate our past attitude towards the National Assembly. Since the government has failed to cease the war and has not implemented the resolutions of the political consultative conference, the Communist Party will not be bound by this National Assembly.

The reporter saw Central Committee member Chen Guofu at the National Assembly Hall at 5:00 PM, accompanied by Hong Lanyou, Deputy Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, and Secretary Ye, inspecting the hall and declaring that the Preparatory Committee's arrangements for the assembly were actively underway.

Also, Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, visited Liang Shuming of the Democratic League on the morning of the 24th. They talked extensively. Both Lei and Liang believed that the current situation is becoming clear and that the outcome will be seen soon.

### Government Troops Recover Xinghe County in Eastern Suiyuan; Fu Zuoyi Returns to Suiyuan After Meeting in Beiping

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] According to reliable sources, the counties of Taolin, Fengzhen, and Jining in eastern Suiyuan have been successively recovered. Xinghe County (a Communist-occupied area), which is strategically important militarily, was recovered by government troops yesterday and has advanced eastward to reduce the threat to Beiping and Tianjin. Also, Guyuan's second and fourth districts have been recovered and are continuing to expand.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Fu Zuoyi suddenly left Beiping by plane at 10:40 AM today. On his way back, he will inspect Datong after the siege is lifted, and may deploy government troops in the western section of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway in the Datong or Jining area to advance towards Zhangjiakou. It is rumored that after secretly arriving in Beiping last night, he went to the Executive Headquarters at 8:30 PM to attend a military meeting to discuss the clearing of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway from east and west. It is said that Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, Wang Hongshao, Song Kentang, Xu Kangliang, and others attended the meeting.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] It was rumored in Beiping a few days ago that government troops would march into Zhangjiakou starting today and recover Zhangjiakou by the end of the month. However, as of the time of this dispatch today, there has been no news of battle from the Qinglong Bridge area. It is understood that the participating combat troops have not yet reached their intended areas, so the battle did not begin today. However, it is generally judged that the move into Zhangjiakou will not be delayed for long, because the autumn harvest is approaching in the north, and government troops are eager to end the war before the autumn harvest in order to obtain food. Furthermore, it will snow in the eighth lunar month, and government troops, whose equipment is not very suitable for cold-weather operations, must also achieve a decisive victory before the arrival of winter.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] A military expert discussed the military geography of Hebei Province, saying: If government troops really move into Zhangyuan as rumored, then western Chahar will be more important than central Chahar. It seems roundabout to enter northern Chahar from Rehe and then advance to Zhangyuan, and the grasslands are not suitable for troop movement and supplies. He continued: If I were the commander defending Zhangyuan, I would make Huailai on the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway the main battleground, because the county seat is located on a mountain. If Huailai is not taken, there will be no problem on the east side of Zhangyuan. However, if I were the commander of the offensive, I would bypass Huailai and reach Xiahuayuan via Yanqing. He did not pay attention to the tense situation in northern Henan and eastern Shandong reported in the newspapers recently, but said that "to catch bandits, first catch the ringleader." The real victory of the war lies in destroying the enemy's main force, and its main force must be in its heart.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] A spokesperson for a senior agency said that the Communist army recently transported more than 300 wounded soldiers from Duolun in northern Chahar to Zhangyuan, but the spokesperson could not confirm whether there had been fighting in the Duolun area, and said that "under certain conditions, government troops can open up to Zhangjiakou in three routes and be forced to fight back." He also hinted that the government troops in eastern Suiyuan have advanced eastward after relieving the siege of Datong. The spokesperson said that a certain affiliated hospital in Zhangjiakou is the only rear hospital for the Communist army. The recent reports of more than 2,000 wounded soldiers being transported back from Datong and more than 1,700 wounded soldiers being transported back from Jining mostly died due to lack of medicine.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 24th] It is reported that the government forces attacking Zhangjiakou are equipped with new weapons and will use a large number of air forces. It is also reported that Zhu De is responsible for defending Zhangyuan and has made preliminary arrangements to prepare for the government forces' attack, and ordered his troops to maintain their strength in preparation for the final battle.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense denied the news from Beiping that government troops had begun to attack Zhangjiakou. The spokesperson told a United Press reporter that the government currently has no such plan, and the Ministry of National Defense has not issued an attack order. He continued that the Ministry of National Defense has not yet received a formal report of the attack from the Beiping Headquarters.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] More than 6,000 members of the Communist army's Rehe Headquarters attacked the government troops in Ningcheng on the 21st and were repelled. The Communist army fled back to the Husutaigou area west of the city. The Communist army north of Jianping attacked the government troops near Liujiadian. After the government troops counterattacked, the Communist army suffered heavy casualties and fled to the Blackwater area.

### Government Troops in Jin Occupy Fushan; Communist Troops in Central Hebei Approach the Suburbs of Xiongxian

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th] Government troops occupied Fushan County on the morning of the 23rd.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] According to a telephone call from Baoding, the government troops advancing towards Xiongxian last night were close to the suburbs of the city and are engaged in fierce fighting.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 24th] A major battle is brewing in southern Hebei. The Communist army in the Shijiazhuang area has recently transferred south on a large scale in an attempt to stop the northbound government troops. The railway bridge between Yuanshi and Saiyi has been destroyed by the Communist army. The Communist army's independent regiment in Yuanshi has also been transferred to the Gaoyi area to prepare to destroy the railway. The government troops that have crossed the Zhang River have launched a fierce battle with Liu Bocheng's troops of the Communist army.

### Restoring the Administration of Chahar Province; Organizing Local Armed Forces

Remarks by Feng Qinzai, Chairman of Chahar Province

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Feng Qinzai, Chairman of Chahar Province, who has been living in Beiping for a long time, told reporters today that after the administration of Chahar Province is restored, a lenient policy will be adopted towards those who have followed the Communist Party, and the past will not be investigated. The first priority for restoring provincial administration is to organize local armed forces. The performance of county magistrates will be judged based on whether they can completely control the county. The circulation of the Communist Party's border region currency will be temporarily prohibited before specific instructions are received from the central government, so whether there will be sufficient legal tender for the people to use is also a question.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Zhang Lisheng, former commander of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Border Region, has now been transferred to the commander of the Chahar Military Region. Zhang is currently in Beiping assisting Chairman Feng Qinzai in reorganizing the local armed forces in Chahar Province.

### Communist Army in Northeast Expands; Troops Transferred to Harbin

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] The Communist army in the Northeast is actively preparing for war. Recently, more than 20,000 troops have been transferred from Jiamusi, Wuchang, and Lanxi to Harbin. A large number of mountain guns, mortars, and infantry machine guns and artillery shells have been transported from Jiamusi to Harbin to supply the troops in Shuangcheng, Taolaizhao, and other places. Also, the tenth and twelfth brigades of the fourth column of the Communist army in the Lianshanguan and Caohekou area have now been expanded into divisions. The original regiments and battalions under each brigade have been expanded into brigades and regiments, and they are currently intensifying replenishment and training.

### Ma Zhanshan to Go to Nanjing Within the Week

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] Ma Zhanshan has been ordered to be transferred to the Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters and will go to Nanjing within the week to ask the central authorities for instructions before returning to Beiping and then Shenyang to take up his new post.

### Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Dig River Embankments Again; Government Troops Advance to Lianshui; Rumors Say the Communist Party's Border Region Government Will Move to Funing

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] The government troops advancing to Lianghuai are now advancing to Lianshui on the one hand and clearing the remnants of the Communist army in the nearby areas on the other. It is reported that the Communist Party's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government was originally located in Huaiyin and may now move to Funing. Li Yimang, the chairman of the border region government, went to Funing half a month ago. After the failure of the incident, he intends to change his style due to political failure to save the situation. In his "Liberated Area Policy Program," he said that he would abandon class struggle and strive for the people and sympathy. Class struggle is the only political means of the Communist Party, and today its contradictions can be seen to be so extreme.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The Communist army in northern Jiangsu dug embankments again in various places to prevent the government troops from recovering. It is reported that in Shuyang County, the Dongdi Chaomi River Northdi of the downstream of the Shuxi River and the Fen Shui Sha River were recently dug and destroyed in many places by the Communist army. The affected areas include more than 20 villages and towns, and more than 10,000 hectares of farmland have been submerged. In Donghai County, the banks of the Qiangwei River, from Hezhuang in the south to Dafuting in the north, were also dug and destroyed by the Communist army, and the flooded area reached more than 240 miles. The area at the junction of Shuhai has become a vast ocean, tens of miles wide. The streets of Donghai and Xinpu Town have been surrounded by water, and the Haixin Highway has been cut off by the water. The above-mentioned disaster situation is extremely serious.

### Xue Yue Talks About the Battle Situation

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] General Xue Yue, Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, met with our reporter on the evening of the 23rd and talked about the recent battle situation, saying that the main political, economic, and military bases of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong are Huaiyin, Jining, Heze, and Linyi. Except for Linyi, all have been recovered by government troops. The Communist army's brutal behavior has plunged the people into misery. Since the government troops were forced to fight back, the people have cooperated and things have gone smoothly. The clearing of the situation in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong is only a matter of time. Talking about the Communist army's strategy and tactics, Xue compared them to mice, because the Communist army has never formally fought against the Japanese army during the war of resistance. The strategy and tactics used are the same as when they were roaming in the past, attacking government troops and driving civilians to charge, resulting in a large number of casualties, which is very lamentable. Xue continued: The Communist Party does not show the national people's desire for stability, and launching a war has lost the hearts of the people. The people in the "Liberated Areas" warmly welcome the government troops and automatically help, which proves that in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, those who violate the interests of the whole people will eat their own evil consequences.

### Qiang Jian, Communist Commando Captain, Defects

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 24th] Official sources said that Qiang Jian, the captain of the forward commando team in the fourth district of the Communist Party's pseudo-Nantong County, recently realized that the Communist Party was disregarding the fate of the nation and destroying peaceful reunification. He defected to our authorities a few days ago and led 126 men, carrying 32 rifles, 62 pistols, and 4 light machine guns. They gathered in the area of Liguan Yintang Henggang in the county to be inspected and reorganized. He was properly taken care of. The Nantong County Government appointed Qiang as the captain of the independent squadron of the Nantong People's Self-Defense Corps and concentrated them for training. Captain Qiang also issued a declaration of defection, resolving to follow the government troops to eliminate the reactionary forces and complete the task of national construction.

### Government Troops in Southern Shandong Recover Jinxiang

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] Government troops recovered Jinxiang County (southwest of Jining) in southern Shandong at noon on the 22nd.

### After Relieving the Siege, A Tour of Datong

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th] This Central News Agency reporter accompanied the慰勞 (comfort) plane to Datong, making us the first guests to land after the siege of Datong was lifted. Since August 16th, when the Datong team of the Military Mediation Department escaped by plane amidst a hail of bullets, the Datong airport has been unusable. Datong was besieged for 45 days, during which the intensity of the battle and the brutality of the Communist army exceeded expectations. Those who did not experience it firsthand would find it difficult to imagine. Outside the North Gate, the station, once a stretch of fine earth, is now covered in bullet marks. The once towering water tower is now nothing more than a cracked tower body and scattered steel bars, a scene for people to mourn. The office of the locomotive section of the station is just a pile of rubble, facing the sign outside the door, lamenting each other's fate. The locomotive factory is a scene of scorched blackness, with brick walls standing forlornly. The locomotives are also covered in scars, their interiors damaged, a sight too terrible to behold. It is estimated that no less than a thousand invading Communist soldiers died under the water tower, according to reliable sources. During this campaign, the Communist army even forced the people to carry yellow explosives, leading them directly to the water tower, and then detonating the explosives from behind, resulting in a horrific scene of flesh and blood flying everywhere, and corpses piled high. Dai Zengjun, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Advance Army, told reporters, "I have been in the military for 26 years and have fought hundreds of battles, but I have never experienced such intense fighting." The Yusha Iron Bridge northeast of the city was also bombed in two places. The wooden bridge on the highway there is the key to the Datong-Yanggao road, and since the farmland is all east of the river, it is also the lifeline of the Datong citizens. This bridge was built by the Japanese in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), taking two years to complete. All the materials were shipped from Jilin. This time, the Communist army actually set fire to and destroyed more than 30 of its spans. Shaling is the only high ground southeast of the city, commanding a view of the airport. The Communist army desperately fought for it, but failed repeatedly. It is said that in the northeast bunker of Shaling alone, the Communist army paid the price of three thousand lives. The police school three miles west of the city still has stone walls, but the interior is completely burned down. Bloodstains can be seen in the sorghum fields near the obstacles, forming a straight line. According to Jiao Kejing, the commander of the 11th Security Regiment responsible for defending the area, the Communist army's 2nd Independent Regiment had only a little over two hundred men left after charging twice. When reporters inspected the bloodstains in the sorghum field, they found a Communist army diary. It was judged to be a platoon leader's diary, which read: "I had two dreams last night. In one dream, my father died, and in the other dream, the enemy (referring to the Nationalist army) was very fierce, and our (referring to the Communist army) ranks could not be assembled. Please make my dreams come true, I am still very afraid in my heart! I wonder why we have to fight a civil war?" The extreme opposition to internal strife among its lower-level cadres is evident here. According to Commander Dong, the Communist army repeatedly released sneezing gas, and many soldiers and civilians were poisoned. We captured several toxic bombs. (It is reported that the Communist army released poison gas in several places, including the police school, Beiyue Temple, and the railway station.) The Communist army's denial of using poison gas is self-defeating. During the siege of Datong, the city was in good order. In the evening, military and political cadres and students divided into sections for security and census. The Jin Opera House performed on time to comfort the wounded soldiers. This was a relaxing interlude in a tense situation. General Chu Xichun, commander of the Nationalist army, told reporters: In this war, the Communist army launched a fierce attack for more than a month with ten times the strength, but we finally won. The main reason was "harmony among the people." He also said that after the siege was lifted, emergency relief would be the first step, followed by rescuing the people of Yanbei. Today, the refugees in Datong who have no homes urgently need relief. The drought in the area has been long-standing, and the autumn harvest will be at most only 30%. Now, further ravaged by the war, the losses are even more severe. On the way back and forth over northern Shanxi, the reporter looked down at the once beautiful mountains and rivers between Datong and Taiyuan. Now, the shadows of the counties of Huairen and Dai County, which have been reduced to hell, evoke endless sighs. The railway tracks between Shuoxian County have all been destroyed, but Yingxian County, an ancient city still defended by the Nationalist army, stands majestically. Inside the city, the Yanbei Plain stretches as far as the eye can see, but old scars and new wounds are everywhere. This scene of the frontier evokes infinite sighs in the hearts of the reporter and others on the plane.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 24th] The Battle of Jining was even fiercer than the Battle of Sipingjie. Over twenty thousand bodies were collected and buried after being found lying on the streets inside and outside the city. Today, when the people mention the Communist army, they cry out in pain. The electric light company has been completely destroyed by the Communist army, and the boilers and important machines have been taken away. The railway station outside the city was also severely damaged. The people suffered even more looting when the Communist army was defeated and collapsed.

### Developing Northeast Industry and Mining: The Resources Committee Announces the Establishment of Fifteen Institutions; Technical Personnel to Be Trained Locally in New Schools

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] Qian Changzhao, chairman of the Resources Committee, recently inspected factories and mines in Jinxi, Huludao, Jinzhou, Beipiao, Fuxin, Shenyang, Fushun, Liaoyang, Anshan, Yingkou, Benxi, Xi'an, Changchun, Jilin, and other places. He held detailed discussions with relevant parties and believes that although the heavy industry in the Northeast has been destroyed, if the existing foundations are properly utilized, there is still much that can be done. In the past, the Japanese operated heavy industry in the Northeast for the purpose of preparing for war and coordinating with military operations, and their plans were often unreasonable. Moreover, they were eager to increase production and neglected some basic work, which affected the resource base. Now that the Northeast has returned to the embrace of the motherland, this shortcoming urgently needs to be adjusted and improved. However, the situation in the Northeast has not yet been fully stabilized, and although many enterprises should be handled by the Resources Committee, it is actually impossible to fully implement them. The most pressing need at present is for senior and mid-level technical personnel. The Resources Committee plans to discuss with the education authorities to establish specialized schools for local training. Currently, based on social needs and in coordination with the overall national economy, the following units will be established starting October 1st of this year among the major enterprises that should be handled by the Resources Committee:

List of Responsible Persons for Each Institution

### An Audit Team in Guangzhou Discovers a Muddled Accounting Mess; Military and Political Department Commissioner Mo Yushuo Placed Under Surveillance

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] The Guangdong-Guangxi Region Audit Team has discovered multiple instances of muddled accounting in recent days, with the most severe cases found in those entities that were taken over by the Military and Political Department Commissioner's Office. The team recently discovered in the Huangsha Treasury that there were 177 boxes of opium at the time when the 50th Division of the New First Army was stationed there. Four boxes went missing from the treasury. When the division departed, it handed over 173 boxes to the Military and Political Department Commissioner's Office. Subsequently, there was collusion between the superiors and subordinates to sell off the entire stock. When the Commissioner's Office transferred the treasury to the Third Supply Zone of the Logistics Department, this item was no longer listed in the inventory. Ao Jingliang and Ao Xiang, who were responsible for managing the warehouse, have absconded for fear of punishment and are currently being secretly pursued. Because a disbursement order was stamped with the private seal of Mo Yushuo, the Military and Political Department Commissioner, Mo is also suspected. The Audit Team has already sent a telegram to President Song, requesting the Ministry of National Defense to thoroughly investigate and severely punish the matter. Mo Yushuo arrived here on the 23rd. Director Wang Heng of the Provisional Headquarters, accompanied by the commander of the 16th Gendarmerie Regiment, waited at the airport with five gendarmerie soldiers. Mo arrived from Shanghai with Zhao, the deputy of the First Gendarmerie Platoon, and an aide-de-camp. He appeared gaunt. After disembarking, he was placed under the surveillance of Commander Zhou. At the same time, two of Mo's confidants who were waiting at the airport were not allowed to approach or speak to him. Mo is currently being held at the Gendarmerie Headquarters, awaiting investigation and processing.

A Sudden Fire in the Warehouse—Something Fishy?

Two days before Mo's arrival, a warehouse in Henan here suddenly caught fire around 10:00 PM on the 21st, and was not completely extinguished until 1:00 PM the next day. The warehouse was taken over by the Third Supply Zone from the Military and Political Department Commissioner's Office, and contained a mountain of supplies, including countless amounts of grain and clothing. The warehouse had been sealed for a year and there had been no anomalies, so the sudden fire during the audit is causing much consternation. According to those involved, the fire was caused by a guard carelessly discarding a cigarette butt that night. The Audit Team is currently investigating. The number of losses is currently difficult to estimate.

According to Zou Yi, the Guangzhou Region Commissioner of the Navy Department, the number of enemy and puppet ships and supplies taken over from the Japanese was very large. However, the existing stock and the estimated numbers are vastly different. It is possible that some criminals have concealed the assets or sold them for personal gain. In addition to grasping the current situation and providing information for the Audit Team's reference, the public is being encouraged to report any leads.

### Metal Bricks Discovered in Guangzhou; Rumored to Be Traitor Assets; To Be Publicly Assayed

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 23rd] The Guangdong-Guangxi Region Audit Team and the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Enemy Assets Disposal Bureau jointly unearthed seventy metal bricks on the 23rd in the Lele Firm in the Tenth Fu District (a traitor's property).

### Beef Cans Turn Into Stones

A Riddle Among Relief Supplies in Jiangxi

[This Newspaper, Nanchang Correspondent] When the Jiangxi Rehabilitation and Relief Branch of the Executive Yuan distributed relief supplies such as canned milk and beef, the agencies receiving these supplies discovered that the wooden boxes containing the cans were filled with cans on top and stones on the bottom. Whether these stones were shipped across the ocean by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or whether there was corruption within the distributing agencies is the subject of much speculation.

### Yi Ao, Head of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Audit Team, Overwhelmed by Grief; Says the Character of the Personnel Involved in the Takeover is Fundamentally Flawed

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 24th] Qiu Ao, head of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Audit Team, has left Hunan and is expected to arrive in Hankou tonight. According to sources from Changsha, Qiu Ao made a statement before leaving Hunan, saying that what distinguishes the audit work in Hunan from other places is the endless stream of escapes. In some cases, the stolen goods are present, but the people have fled far away; in other cases, the people have not left, but the goods have disappeared. To reduce the difficulty of the work, he rarely published the progress of the audit during his month-long stay in Hunan. Now that the audit has come to an end, most of the cases have been transferred to the court for investigation, and a few unfinished matters have also been entrusted to the provincial and municipal councils for continued settlement. He plans to submit a general report after returning to Hankou, so there is no need to elaborate further. However, there are some things he still feels compelled to say: After handling this audit work, he deeply feels the lack of national concept and moral values among the general takeover personnel, which is truly heartbreaking. For example, when the enemy withdrew from Yueyang, the local electrical equipment was still complete and intact, but the takeover personnel had the heart to dismantle and sell various equipment piecemeal to enrich their own pockets, resulting in the current situation in Yueyang, which has returned to the primitive era. In this regard, if a person's character is fundamentally flawed, it is no exaggeration to say that they are no different from beasts. Furthermore, the Hankou District Court has been investigating the case of corruption in the auction of materials from the Jianghan Customs for days, and Chen, the tax affairs officer, and three inspectors are under suspicion.

### The Northeast Region Audit Team Concludes Its Work

### Editorial: The Inside Story of the Anti-American Diplomatic Offensive

Soviet Representative Gromyko spoke at the United Nations Security Council the day before yesterday, urging attention to the situation in China and explaining his reasons. The main points were three: (1) The continued presence of American troops in China has created a situation that could lead to international friction; (2) American troops are currently interfering in the internal affairs of China, Iceland, and Latin American countries; (3) The situation in China is not solely related to the United States and China.

We are not surprised by these remarks from Representative Gromyko. In his speech, it was the same old tune, and no new elements were found. Some time ago, the Moscow radio station broadcast anti-American rhetoric, and Soviet newspapers published articles criticizing American interference in the Chinese civil war. We have long been accustomed to hearing and seeing these. The Chinese Communists, acting in concert, have also repeatedly performed the set of anti-American propaganda offensives they learned from their "teacher" in China. We are tired of hearing and seeing it. Therefore, Representative Gromyko's remarks are not worthy of attention. However, at this moment, some American friends, incited by leftist elements, and some politicians in China incited by the Chinese Communists, are simultaneously performing "American Withdrawal from China Week," as if they had agreed to be cheerleaders for Gromyko, making this performance a little too obvious.

Gromyko's intention in making such remarks is nothing more than to launch a diplomatic offensive against the United States. Because the Soviet representative failed repeatedly at the Paris Peace Conference and was unable to exert its power to control the conference, it seized the opportunity to exploit the border conflict between Greece and Albania and launch a large-scale attack on the British troops stationed in Greece. However, when it came to the Security Council, it failed to expand its diplomatic offensive, so it changed direction and attempted to launch an offensive against the United States by exploiting the China issue, to restore the Soviet Union's international prestige. At the same time, the Wallace incident in the United States, which was triggered by Wallace's advocacy of appeasement toward the Soviet Union, caused a political uproar, resulting in Wallace's resignation, making the Soviet Union even more suspicious that the US government had a tendency toward the "two worlds." Therefore, it created "American Withdrawal from China Week" on the one hand, and adopted preemptive measures in diplomacy on the other, intending to throw a bomb into American public opinion, to stir up domestic debate in the United States, forcing President Truman to be wary. But in our view, no matter what external opinions are, the diplomatic policy of the United States is so upright that there is no gap to exploit, and there is no reason for it to be shaken.

President Truman issued a declaration on China policy last December, with three main points: (1) The United States recognizes the National Government as the sole legitimate government of China; (2) The United States hopes that China will become a strong, united, and democratic country; (3) The United States does not interfere in China's internal affairs. So far, the United States has not changed. As for the continued presence of American troops in China, it is at the request of the National Government to assist China in repatriating enemy aliens and prisoners of war and to establish peace and order within China, a task that has unfortunately not been completed due to the obstruction of the Communist Party. Therefore, to have American troops withdraw from China, there is no need to ask the United States; it is only necessary for the Communist Party to cease obstructing China's recovery and unification to achieve the goal. The Soviet representative said that the American troops in China have already created a situation sufficient to cause international friction. What is the basis for this claim?

China is also a permanent member of the Security Council. The China issue can only be resolved by itself. Even if it is to be brought before the Security Council, our own representative can submit it, so why is it necessary for Soviet representative Gromyko to overstep his authority? Gromyko considers himself to be speaking out for justice, but we do not understand how Gromyko's "justice" should be interpreted. We go a step further and say that even if we admit that Gromyko's speech is entirely out of good intentions, where does Gromyko's overstepping of authority place China? And some Chinese politicians who follow Gromyko and shout that the China issue should be resolved by the UN Security Council are all a complete expression of servile mentality.

China and the Soviet Union are both major powers in the Far East and should cooperate to maintain lasting peace in the Far East. China received spiritual and material assistance from the Soviet Union during the War of Resistance, and we still remember it to this day. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty, our country's diplomacy with the Soviet Union has been based on the treaty. But on the Soviet side, although the foreign ministers of the three countries agreed at the meeting last December not to interfere in China's internal affairs, has the Soviet government truly implemented its commitment to promoting friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union? This July, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov actually opposed China's invitation to the Paris Peace Conference, and now Gromyko is overstepping his authority, treating our country as inferior to Albania. We do not know why the Soviet Union wants to insult its ally China to such an extent!

The diplomatic policy adopted by China, as repeatedly stated by Minister Wang Shijie, is entirely based on international cooperation to jointly maintain world peace as the highest guiding principle. Therefore, it consistently adopts an impartial and neutral attitude in all international conferences. As for the issue of negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it is an internal affair of our country and has nothing to do with the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative suddenly overstepping his authority and bringing China's internal affairs before the Security Council is deeply regrettable. The National Government should immediately express its opposition and protest. And we hope that a group of people who have forgotten their national position and are shouting "American troops out of China" will one day deeply regret it!

### Adjournment of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly

The First Shanghai Municipal Assembly was held for two weeks and two days, and adjourned yesterday afternoon, issuing a declaration. During the sixteen-day session, news of the Assembly filled the city's newspapers. The events questioned by the Assembly and the motions discussed attracted the attention of the entire city. Even various industries and businesses often formed delegations to petition the Assembly. This shows that Shanghai citizens really need an organization that represents public opinion. And the achievements of this Municipal Assembly, from a calm and rational perspective, can be generally considered not too far from our expectations.

Of course, after eight years of wartime occupation, Shanghai is dilapidated and has suffered from the soaring prices of the past year since victory. Industry and commerce have long been outwardly strong but inwardly weak, with only a superficial shell remaining. People's livelihoods are declining, and the people's capacity is exhausted. In terms of municipal finances, it is already unbearable. However, because Shanghai has a hundred things to be done after the war, if we want it to gradually recover and maintain its status as a first-class international city, municipal construction cannot be delayed. The original budget for the second half of the year for the Municipal Government was over 84.7 billion yuan, with a deficit of over 33.3 billion yuan. Now, under the general principles of increasing revenue, reducing expenditure, and emphasizing construction while eliminating redundant personnel, the Municipal Assembly has reduced it to a little over 75.5 billion yuan, and the deficit has also been reduced to a little over 22.2 billion yuan. In a situation where no other methods could be found, the Municipal Government was allowed to levy municipal construction donations and surcharges on public utilities to make up for the shortfall. On the one hand, the Assembly showed concern for the people's capacity, and on the other hand, it could not bear to see Shanghai's municipal administration fall into a state of stagnation. It resolutely took responsibility and solved this difficult problem for the administrative authorities and the citizens of the city. It cannot be denied that it has the proper style of a local parliament in a democratic country. The essence of democratic politics lies in taking responsibility. Criticism must be responsible, and resolutions must be responsible. If the people's representatives only know how to sing high-sounding tunes and make indiscriminate criticisms, while avoiding responsibility where it should be borne, then nothing will ever be resolved. What construction can be discussed?

Secondly, when we see that the Municipal Assembly has made fairly reasonable resolutions or suggestions on several major issues, we especially feel that Shanghai citizens really have their representatives speaking for them. For example: (1) In terms of education, it advocates that expenses should account for 20% of the total expenditure, and that educational decorations must be abolished, focusing on national education to solve the problem of children out of school; requiring strict examination of the tuition fees and their use by private schools, and requiring that the tuition standards for the next semester must be approved by the Municipal Assembly; (2) In terms of industry, commerce, and finance, it accepts the appeals of the industry and commerce circles, and will send representatives to the central government to make sincere petitions to save the collapse of the Shanghai market; (3) In terms of construction in various departments such as public works, public utilities, sanitation, and police, it makes every effort to support all construction plans that should be carried out, and stipulates the required expenses, but does not allow them to be consumed in "supporting people"; (4) In terms of people's daily life, it urges the government to make efforts to curb the rising prices, suggests that the central government formulate regulations on housing rentals based on social customs, calls on the government to abolish unnecessary fuel control measures as soon as possible, and change to encouraging people to transport coal to Shanghai to prevent coal shortages in winter; At the same time, it instructed the Municipal Government to negotiate the recovery of the racecourse land and develop it into parks and sports venues, and asked the Central Government to interpret whether horse racing is gambling, etc., which can be seen to be close to the opinions of the real people.

Now, the first conference of the Municipal Assembly has adjourned. In three months, we will see its second conference convened. We deeply hope that in these three months, the Municipal Government will respect the resolutions of this Municipal Assembly and implement them one by one; especially hope that the various specialized committees of the Municipal Assembly can closely contact the relevant bureaus of the Municipal Government on weekdays and regularly review their work. Then, when the second conference is convened in the future, the criticism and resolutions of the public opinion organs on the administrative affairs of the Municipal Government will be more practical and effective.

### Stalin's Remarks Clearly Indicate that There is No Danger of War at Present; Claims that Cooperation with Western Countries Is Possible; Believes that Rapid Withdrawal of American Troops from China Is Necessary for Maintaining Peace

[France News Agency, London, 24th] Head of State Stalin today met with the Moscow correspondent of the "Sunday Times" and delivered a speech, which was broadcast by British radio. The newspaper reporter asked Stalin whether he believed that the rapid withdrawal of American troops from China was necessary to maintain peace? Stalin replied: "Indeed, that is my opinion." The reporter asked Stalin whether he believed that the United Kingdom and the United States are surrounding the Soviet Union with a capitalist iron ring? Stalin replied: "There is no danger of war at present. If these countries want to do this (I cannot be sure), they will certainly not succeed." When the reporter asked about the German issue, Stalin replied: "I don't think it is a problem that the Soviet Union is using Germany to oppose Western Europe and the United States." Stalin said when discussing the Potsdam Agreement and the Anglo-Soviet Treaty: "The Soviet Union's policy in Germany is only to ensure the safest guarantee of a solid and lasting peace." The reporter then asked: Does the atomic bomb threaten peace? Stalin said: "The atomic bomb is not enough to determine war. Monopolizing the atomic bomb is enough to endanger peace, but there are some facts and methods to eliminate this danger. The so-called fact is that the monopoly cannot last, and the so-called method is to prohibit the use of atomic bombs."

[Associated Press, London, 24th] Stalin made remarks in Moscow today, expressing his belief that peaceful cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western democracies "has not only not diminished, but will grow even more." He also denounced accusations that Moscow influences the policies of communist parties in Western Europe as "absurd and borrowed from the bankrupt Hitler and Goebbels arsenal." He also said that he has "firm faith" in Anglo-Soviet friendly relations.

### British Side Is Carefully Studying the Views of Soviet Leaders

[Our News] London, 24th Broadcast: A senior official in London today made an informal statement saying that Stalin's statement that "there will be no new war" is clearly telling Western countries that the Soviet Union will also respond to the strong attitude of the United States with a strong attitude. A diplomatic spokesman said that the views of Soviet leaders are being closely studied by all parties, but how the government will respond cannot be predicted at this time, and said that Stalin's reply was "firm and friendly." Stalin's claim that the ruling circles of the United Kingdom and the United States want to implement a next-capitalist encirclement of the Soviet Union is also impossible, which is clearly a warning and opinion that the United States should withdraw its troops from China as soon as possible. One of the most important points is that Stalin believes that the atomic bomb is only enough to intimidate "neurotic people" and is not enough to become a decisive factor in future wars. In addition, Stalin also hinted that the Soviet Union will soon have atomic bombs as well.

### Soviet Union Proposes to the Security Council that American Troops in China Should Withdraw; Claims that This Move Is Easy to Cause International Friction; Our Representative Opposes Interference by the Security Council

[Our News] Washington, 24th Broadcast: Lake Success, New York News: Xie, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Security Council, protested against Soviet representative Gromyko's statement in the Security Council that the presence of American troops in China is sufficient to threaten world peace. He said that the country opposes the Security Council considering the Soviet proposal, because the current situation in China does not require the Security Council to interfere.

[United Press, Lake Success, New York, 23rd] The Soviet Union today raised the issue of the situation in China to the United Nations Security Council, urging it to pay attention. Soviet representative Gromyko accused the US Marines of staying in China, which may cause international friction; Gromyko said that the US cars are interfering in the internal affairs of China, Iceland and Latin America, and said that after the failure of Japan and Germany, the stationing of foreign troops in non-enemy countries can no longer be considered out of war necessity. He cited appeals from a group of famous Chinese figures, urging the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and said that the resulting situation in China is not only related to the United States and China. Gromyko's statement is the first formal action by the Soviet Union to attack the United States' China policy. Moscow newspapers had previously attacked this policy of the United States several times, and political observers had long been convinced that the sudden unease in the country would eventually be brought up in the Security Council. This action by the Soviet Union occurred after the failure of the political war against Greece. Observers believe that if the Soviet Union insists on not giving in on the China issue, Gromyko will be in a stronger position, because a large part of the left-wing opinion in the United States opposes the so-called unilateral assistance of the United States to the Chinese National Government to oppose the Communist Party.

[France News Agency, New York, 23rd] The Soviet Union proposed to the Security Council that all member states of the United Nations report on the situation of their troops stationed overseas, and the Security Council will discuss it soon. It is heard that in order to preempt the situation, the United States will notify the Security Council that American troops are withdrawing from China, Iceland, and other foreign countries in accordance with international agreements. According to what Soviet representative Gromyko said, the overseas deployment of American troops constitutes a threat to world peace and security. US representative Johnson will refute this and list the facts to prove that US troops are withdrawing in accordance with the planned plan.

### Wallace Expresses Agreement with Stalin's and Eden's Remarks

Said to Give the World New Hope for Peace

[Our News] San Francisco, 24th Broadcast: Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace said today: "The recent remarks by Stalin and Eden have given new hope for peace to the millions of people who seek peace."

### Suggestion to Organize Federation in British-Occupied Area of Germany

[Our News] Paris, 24th Broadcast Berlin News: Regarding the division of the British-occupied areas of Germany into federations, the German Issues Research Committee recently submitted two proposals to the British Control Committee: (1) Five regions of considerable importance: including northern Westphalia, Hamburg, the Rhine, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen. (2) Prepared by representatives of Brunswick, dividing smaller areas to form two federal regions. (A) Including the Rhine, northern Westphalia, (B) the low-lying areas of Germany. The above-mentioned federal regions will be similar to the state parliament in Stuttgart in the American-occupied area. However, the British military government authorities have not yet formally announced this measure.

### Four Foreign Ministers Meet Yesterday to Seek Solutions to Difficult Problems at the Peace Conference; Stalin's Remarks Clarify the Political Atmosphere

[Our News] Paris, 24th Broadcast: The four major powers are preparing to hold a meeting at Bidault's office at 4 pm Greenwich Mean Time to end the work of the peace conference by October 15. Stalin's claim that there is no danger of a new war has greatly clarified the political atmosphere in Paris. Bernas's increased credibility due to Wallace's dismissal may also have an impact on the discussions among the four foreign ministers. The most difficult issues facing the peace conference are the status of Trieste and the establishment of a demilitarized zone along the Greek border with Bulgaria. The four foreign ministers may also stipulate the date and location for discussing the peace treaty with Germany. Bernas advocated holding it in New York, but many believe that Molotov prefers to hold it in Europe. Australian representative Hodgson requested that the peace conference be convened again in a year to decide on the issue of Italian colonies.

### My Representative Argues for Libyan Independence

[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 24th Broadcast: Abyssinia's demand to Italy for the annexation of Eritrea and access to the Red Sea as compensation for losses incurred during Italy's war of aggression against Abyssinia has essentially been guaranteed today. As representatives from various countries discussed this matter, they unanimously supported Abyssinia's request. Western powers such as the British and American representatives, however, all advocated that the final disposition of colonial issues must be deferred for a year. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi proposed placing Libya under United Nations control for several years or immediately granting it independence, which was seconded by the American and Indian representatives.

### Military Committee Passes Resolution to Lift Greek-Bulgarian Border Defenses

[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 24th Broadcast: The Military Committee of the peace conference passed, by a vote of eleven to seven, an amendment to the peace treaty with Bulgaria proposed by Greece, dismantling Bulgarian border fortifications. Three abstained. Those who opposed were the Brazilian and Slavic representatives.

### The Threat of War is Imminent, The US, Britain and the USSR Should Understand Each Other

—Speech by Former British Foreign Secretary Eden—

[United Press, London, 24th Dispatch] British Conservative Party wartime Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech today, strongly urging a "new military rapprochement" between Britain, America and the Soviet Union, as current relations contain an imminent "threat" of war. He stated that there is no reason why Communism and Capitalism should not coexist peacefully. While Eden's sentiments are similar to those of former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace, he criticized the U.S. for its censure of British imperialism. Eden also echoed former Prime Minister Churchill's support for the formation of a United States of Europe, saying that he wanted to call Wallace's attention to the British Commonwealth, which is "a family of free nations." Regarding the Paris Peace Conference and world relations, Eden said, "It would be foolish to underestimate the seriousness of the situation. The current situation is particularly uneasy. Not only have I seen in this state of affairs the threat of war is imminent, even anyone who reads the news can deduce that with each passing week, feelings of hostility and animosity grow stronger."

### Nuremberg International Tribunal Completes Trial of Nazi Party Organizations

Involving at Least One Million Defendants

[United Press, Nuremberg, 23rd Dispatch] The International Tribunal here has completed the trial of seven Nazi Party organizations, involving at least one million defendants.

### Molotov Hosts Banquet for Hungarian Delegation

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov hosted a banquet today for the Hungarian delegation attending the peace conference, and delivered a brief speech, saying that although Hungary and the Soviet Union may have some differences in viewpoints, he remains confident in the future of friendship between the two countries. Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi delivered a response, saying that the Hungarian people are willing to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union and have complete trust in the Soviet people.

### Greek Terrorists Become Increasingly Rampant, Disturbing Villages in Crowds

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 24th Dispatch] Greek terrorist activity is becoming increasingly rampant. Today, 1,500 terrorists occupied the town of Tescati and nine nearby villages, cut all telephone lines, and subdued local police. Later, a large contingent of police arrived, and the terrorists retreated.

### Italians Resentful of England and the harsh conditions of the peace treaty

[Reuters, Rome, 22nd Dispatch] Italians feel that the conditions of the peace treaty are too harsh on Italy, and unfriendly actions have begun against British soldiers stationed in Italy. Several months ago, when the Royal Marines band performed in Venice, they were met with roars from a large group of young people. The situation has deteriorated ever since. Italian civilians, even military and police personnel, are openly expressing unwelcome attitudes towards Allied personnel. Italians believe that the proposal to divide the Italian fleet is a major blow to Italy's reputation, and they believe that Britain bears a large part of the responsibility for this. Italians also feel that their contribution to the Allied war effort in the later stages of the war has not been adequately recognized by the Allies.

### Spanish Republican Government Officers Form Secret Organizations Within the Country

### Soviet Internal Purge Movement Occurring This Summer

—Written by United Press staff member Shakiri Belvin—Special translation by our newspaper's translation office—

[United Press, New York, 24th Dispatch] Many things have happened inside the Soviet Union this summer, but the outside world only knows some fragments. But now we can piece these fragments together and understand their meaning. These many things all indicate that major changes have taken place inside the Soviet Union.

The first to mention this kind of thing was United Press correspondent Hendar, in two telegrams sent from Moscow to the New York headquarters on June 26, which said: "Moscow newspapers are all saying that the National Control Department is eliminating and interrogating factory directors, engineers, and accountants across the country who have falsified production figures, illegally accepted extra party funds, abused factory funds, and used state property for private purposes."

Other dispatches from Moscow since June show that Stalin's post-war purge is not limited to Soviet industry, but also affects various government departments, the Red Army, the Communist Party, and the intellectual community.

In recent days, two-thirds of the four pages of Moscow newspapers have been about the dereliction of Soviet citizens. But this cleanup is different from before, because the crimes are limited to imprisonment and fines.

On July 17, United Press reported from Moscow unconfirmed reports that the famous Soviet hero, Sukov, had been transferred to the post of Odessa Garrison Commander.

Several days later, this news was confirmed, but Soviet newspapers did not mention it at all.

The second Soviet leader to lose his position was Litvinov (Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister). On August 23, the Soviet government officially announced the removal of the 70-year-old diplomat. On the same day, Shi Nuofu, director of the Soviet Meat and Dairy Industry, was also removed from his post. According to Ukrainian Communist Party Secretary Khrushchev, the personnel in Ukraine are being transferred to strengthen the discipline of party members and the government.

### Indian Muslim League Seeks Aid from the Soviet Union, Asks for Support for the Partition of India. Nehru Clarifies Independent Foreign Policy

[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] Haroon Din, news secretary for the Muslim League of the Indian province of Sindh, flew to Paris on Thursday to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, intending to ask the Soviet Union to support the Muslim League's proposal for the partition of India in the United Nations General Assembly and the Paris Peace Conference. Haroon had just arrived from India. He advocated that the Muslim League send a very strong delegation to Moscow to explain and promote the demands of Muslims. He also contacted the British Communist Party to obtain their support.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 24th Dispatch] The Central Committee of the Indian National Congress met today, chaired by Nehru, Prime Minister of the Interim Government. He delivered a speech, emphasizing the work facing the committee and particularly stressing that India has entered a new historical stage. He also formally announced his resignation from the post of party chairman. Nehru also said that the Communist Party, which opposes the National Congress everywhere, has lost its credibility. The various steps taken by the National Congress to deal with the Communist Party should not be mistaken as being directed against the Soviet Union. The Interim Government's foreign policy will be independent in nature and does not wish to become a dependency of any foreign country.

### More Than 200 Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Have Been Evacuated to the Allied Defense Zone

[United Press, Batavia, 23rd Dispatch] Dutch East Indies military authorities announced today that Dutch troops, at the request of the Overseas Chinese in Tangerang and Sibompu, had evacuated 250 Overseas Chinese to the Allied defense zone. The Overseas Chinese in Tangerang were subjected to a massacre several months ago.

### A Reminder to Those Naturalized as Americans: Losing Nationality if Not Returning to the US

[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] A bill recently passed by the United States Congress stipulates that any person naturalized as an American citizen who resides in their country of birth for three years or resides in another country for more than five years will lose their American citizenship on October 14 of this year if they do not plan to return. However, there are some exceptions, such as those who have resided in the United States for more than 25 years after naturalization, and those who are 65 years of age or older when residing abroad, are not subject to this restriction. In addition, representatives of American companies or institutions whose headquarters are located in the United States, as well as those who are recuperating abroad for health reasons or studying in other countries, may also be considered exceptions. Apart from these, there is no way to avoid it. Naturalized citizens who wish to retain their American citizenship must return to the country to reside.

### Japanese Currency Inflation

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] The total amount of Japanese currency in circulation has reached approximately 70 billion yen, and the Japanese government is considering raising the price level, which will be implemented from November.

### Hurricane Turns Toward the East China Sea

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] After passing over Guam, the Pacific hurricane is reported to have moved north today, reaching the area between Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands, and is moving towards the East China Sea, with the possibility of turning to attack the Kure region of southern Japan.

### Japanese People No Longer Interested in the National Flag

Few National Flags on the Imperial Spirit Festival

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] Today is the Japanese Autumn Imperial Spirit Festival, and a ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace. Banks and most shops are closed. Although the Occupation Forces Headquarters allowed Japanese public and private houses to fly the national flag today, only a small number of national flags are flying. A Japanese person said: "The Japanese people no longer feel interested in the national flag."

### A Glimpse of the Inside Story of Japanese Politics During the Konoe and Suetsugu Cabinets

Koiso Believed that Concluding a Treaty with the Soviet Union and Colonizing the South Could Promote the Starting Point for Achieving an Agreement with China

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] The Far East International Tribunal continued today with the prosecution presenting German documents, exposing the inside story of the collusion of the Axis powers. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Pact in 1939, Japan was in a difficult situation, so it instructed its ambassador to Germany to suspend negotiations on concluding the Tripartite Pact. In the following year (1940), when the German army successfully carried out a blitzkrieg on the Western Front, Japanese activists were greatly impressed. They again advocated strengthening relations with the Axis powers, ignoring the cautious arguments of the upper echelons of the political world, and accelerated the alliance with Germany and Italy, which ultimately led to a great disaster. From these documents, it can be seen that the relationship between the Axis powers was always manipulated behind the scenes by the German Foreign Ministry, the German Ambassador to Japan, Walter Stahmer, etc., while the Japanese side was dazzled by the current changes and used by Germany. The prosecutor also presented the diary of former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido, revealing the inside story of Japanese politics around July 1940, when the Yonai Cabinet was forced to collapse and transformed into the Konoe Cabinet, and the decision was made to take the Tripartite Pact route.

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] The prosecutor of the International Tribunal today read out a secret report from the former German Ambassador to Japan, Walter, to Berlin, proving that Germany informed Japan in June 1940 that if Japan agreed to attack the Philippines and Hawaii when the United States attacked Germany, Germany would allow Japan to act freely in the Dutch East Indies and French Vietnam. The then Minister of Colonial Affairs, Koiso, agreed with this proposal. The cause of the attack on the United States stemmed from Japan asking Walter whether Germany was prepared to mediate between Japan and the central government of China, so as to end the Chinese war in a manner acceptable to Japan. The then Minister of the Army, Muto, admitted that Japan wanted to get involved in Vietnam. Koiso also said that Japan had the possibility of concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, at which time the Soviet Union would probably demand some territorial concessions in northwestern China and Outer Mongolia. Koiso believed that concluding an agreement with the Soviet Union and realizing Japan's colonial desires in the South would not only gradually make Japan economically independent from the United States, but also serve as a starting point for concluding an agreement with China. Walter concluded: "As of now, I believe it is obvious that the formation of a Pacific group composed of China, Japan, and the Soviet Union, combined with Germany, would tie the United States' hands in the Pacific region and deprive it of its freedom of action." Walter's defense lawyer requested that Walter be summoned for cross-examination. Presiding Judge Webb replied that he would decide after consideration.

### How to Drop the Atomic Bomb and Hit the Enemy Thousands of Miles Away—This is the Problem Most Concerned by the US Military Today

—Written by United Press correspondent Miller—Special translation by our newspaper's translation office

The problem of most concern to the US military's supreme command today is how to drop the atomic bomb on enemy targets thousands of miles away. The US government has issued two public announcements in the past week, both of which lead people to think this way. One is what the White House revealed: the Joint Chiefs of Staff has decided to postpone indefinitely the third atomic bomb test originally scheduled to be held on Bikini Atoll next April. The second is what the Navy Department announced: the 45,000-ton battleship "Kentucky" and the 27,000-ton battlecruiser "Hawaii," which have not yet been completed, will be converted into

Rocket warships

The supreme command is planning to use the remaining manpower and financial resources to focus on studying how to use long-range rockets to launch atomic bombs, rather than diverting resources to atomic bomb tests, because the destructive power of the atomic bomb has already been proven. The Army and Navy are determined not to use the weapons used in the last war when participating in a new war, and are currently working on rocket research, believing that rockets that are remotely controlled and equipped with atomic warheads that can fly across oceans and continents are extremely useful and will inevitably be widely used, so the US Army and Navy both want to

Improve old weapons, but the Navy is deeply afraid of falling behind the Army in this regard. When the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb test was underway, the Army had already launched V-2 rockets in the deserts of New Mexico. As early as July of this year, when the atomic bomb test had not yet been held, Vice Admiral Blandy expressed deep concern about the slow progress of the Navy's rocket research plan. Blandy was both the commander of the atomic bomb test and the director of the Navy's Special Weapons Operations Department. Five days before the second

Atomic bomb test, he said he wanted to return to Washington as soon as possible. Regarding the Navy's research on rockets, he said: "The rocket test has not yet been under my command." However, Blandy and other leaders participating in the atomic bomb test all hoped that the deep-water atomic bomb test would be carried out as scheduled, which was the final and highest-level test of the atomic bomb's power against naval ships. Regarding the postponement of further atomic bomb tests, responsible officials have not openly put forward the urgency of rocket tests as a reason for the postponement, but other reasons do not seem to hold water. Demobilization is a secondary factor, but undoubtedly it is a factor. As for the cost factor, it seems even more unbelievable. White House Secretary Ross estimated that the cancellation of the deep-water

Test can save the country 35 million yuan, but if the military believes that the completion of this test is absolutely necessary for the safety of the United States, then it will never think that the cost is too huge. The military seems to be willing to spend money and manpower in other areas, namely the delivery method of the atomic bomb, which seems to be certain. Atomic bomb testers can collect data from one test and infer what should happen under different circumstances. They can use a small piece of TNT explosive in a pool to test and then roughly deduce the situation of the first and second atomic bomb tests, but often

The results are unexpected, and the situation of the third deep-water test is exactly the same. Blandy said: "That's exactly why we are doing these tests." The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth bombs have proven that the atomic energy released in one billionth of a second has tremendous destructive power, so the deep-water test is indeed necessary and necessary, but the military clearly feels that other new research is more important. The urgent problem at present is not how powerful the atomic bomb is, but how to drop the atomic bomb on the enemy in the shortest time and reach the greatest distance.

### Laying a Solid Foundation for Democratic Politics The Senate Held a Grand Closing Ceremony Speaker Pan Expressed Deep Satisfaction with the Achievement of the Ideal of the General Assembly

Hoping that the Legislative and Executive Branches will Work Together to Complete the Preliminary Construction of Shanghai

The Municipal Senate concluded its 16-day continuous meeting at 6:30 PM yesterday, completing all agenda items, and held a grand and simple closing ceremony.

After playing music and performing ceremonial rituals, the Speaker first delivered a speech, stating that the General Assembly was extended by two days due to the large number of proposals. During the General Assembly, we were very cautious and worked hard. All the items that should be discussed and the responsibilities that should be borne have been largely resolved. I believe that every colleague has laid a solid and sound foundation for Chinese democratic politics, especially Shanghai democratic politics. What I am most grateful and admire for this time is that the Mayor fully understands the true meaning of democratic politics and is extremely respectful of this Council. He attended and participated in every meeting and tried his best to explain the areas that this Council did not fully understand. Originally, the progress of democratic politics must rely on the mutual cooperation and assistance between the legislative and executive branches in order to be completed successfully. The legislative and executive branches both serve the people. The only difference is that the paths and responsibilities are different. I feel that our spirit in this General Assembly has reached this ideal. I am especially grateful to all colleagues for their enthusiastic attendance. The General Assembly has never been adjourned or failed to meet. It has always been conducted in a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere. This is something that the first Municipal Senate deserves to be proud of. I hope to continue to encourage each other in the future. We feel very sorry and ashamed that the budget passed this time increased the burden on citizens, but we hope that citizens will take the overall situation into account and forgive us. Please forgive me for mentioning the Dagong Evening News again and again. They criticized the budget passed by this Council as very reasonable. On the one hand, we should take into account the pain and burden of the people, and on the other hand, we should also take into account the construction, restoration, and development of the municipality. Therefore, the budget proposal took a lot of time to discuss. Now I hope that the municipal government will immediately recompile it based on the resolution of the General Assembly and submit it to this Council as a basis for assessment and supervision. In particular, I hope that the budget for the next year can be submitted before the second General Assembly of this Council in December, so that it can be reviewed more carefully and meticulously. As for the final account for this year, I hope that it can be reviewed at the third General Assembly of this Council in March next year. The review of the budget and final accounts is indeed the most important task of this Council, so I would like to specifically draw the attention of the authorities and hope that the legislative and executive branches will work together to complete the preliminary construction of democratic politics in Shanghai!

The Mayor's Speech Declared That He Will Follow the Instructions of the General Assembly and Execute Them Without Compromise

The Mayor then delivered a speech, believing that democratic politics has indeed been established in Shanghai. He said: "I feel very honored that the first Municipal Senate is being held during my term. The achievements of the Speaker and all the Senators in the General Assembly can be compared with any parliament in the world without shame. The most feared thing about a parliament is being irresponsible, only knowing how to criticize without knowing how to offer suggestions and instructions. However, this Senate is very responsible and admirable. Now you have fully demonstrated the spirit of democratic politics, and it will be the turn of the administrative side to continue. I can guarantee that I will definitely accept the instructions of the General Assembly and execute them without compromise according to your wishes. Secondly, I hope that after the General Assembly closes, the standing committees of each group will continue to maintain contact with the executive agencies, because legislation is relatively easy, but execution is often not ideal, and even abuses may occur. Therefore, I hope that you will listen carefully and report more. I will definitely accept it sincerely."

The Senators' Response Argued and Decided and Acted. Hoping to Continue Efforts

After the Mayor finished his speech, Senator Tao Baichuan was publicly recommended by the Senate to deliver a reply, stating: "I felt very encouraged by the sixteen days of meetings held by this Council. The Chinese meeting system has not been implemented for long. According to past meetings, most of them have failed, leaving behind four catchphrases, namely, 'Meeting without discussion, discussion without decision. Decision without action, action without movement.' After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the meeting has made much progress compared to the past. The achievements of our General Assembly can prove this. We are 'meeting and discussing,' that is, since the meeting was held, there has never been a failure to meet. 'Meeting and discussing' and 'discussing and deciding' can be said to have been achieved.

As for whether the decision can be acted upon, this is the responsibility of the municipal government. We have already fulfilled the first half of our responsibility, and the second part needs to be done by the municipal government. I hope that the municipal government can also make progress in administration after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Our Mayor Wu is a wise mayor. Based on his past talents and experiences, I know that he has faith in democracy and will definitely respect public opinion. I also believe that he will definitely 'act on the decision' after 'discussing and deciding.'

However, just 'acting' is not enough. It must be 'acting and moving.' However, this 'movement' cannot be achieved by the power of the Mayor alone or a small number of competent authorities. Instead, it requires the continuous supervision and assistance of the Senate colleagues to achieve it. Various committees are institutions that represent the future continuous supervision and assistance to the municipal government. Human beings often have inertia. If we are not supervised, we may not work hard. Therefore, I hope that our voters can supervise and help us, so that we have the power to supervise the municipal government. Because with enthusiastic citizens, there will be a loyal parliament, and with a loyal parliament, there will be a sound municipal government. Therefore, we earnestly hope that citizens will supervise us at any time and continue to work hard.

During this meeting, we should especially thank Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, especially Speaker Pan, for their hard work (all senators applauded enthusiastically). This parliament has many people and many things. Without Speaker Pan's wisdom and experience to lead and instruct, there would be no such great achievement. We should warmly comfort them (applause again). The journalists this time also demonstrated the public opinion of democratic politics in the newspapers. If the Senate did not have the supervision of journalists, it might have been abandoned halfway. Shanghai newspapers have indeed become the mouthpiece of the people and the vanguard of the Chinese press. We should especially thank the press for this Council."

### Building the Pujiang Bridge Advocate for Citizens' One-Day Donation Drive Readers Sent Letters to this Newspaper for Transmission and Passed by the Meeting

Proposal No. 31 of the Industry and Commerce Group is a letter from a reader that this newspaper forwarded to the Senate. This letter was written by Mr. Zhang Decai, advocating a one-day donation drive for Shanghai citizens to build the Huangpu River Bridge. After the review committee submitted it to the General Assembly as a recommendation and sent it to the Urban Planning Committee for reference, it was unanimously approved by the General Assembly. Mr. Zhang's proposed methods include singing free operas, holding charity ball games, people from all walks of life donating one day's salary, landlords donating one day's rent, and rickshaw pullers and tricycle pullers donating all fares, etc.

### War of Resistance Losses - Negotiate Compensation

The Councilors passed Proposals No. 10, 11, and 12 without dissent yesterday morning. The reasons for the three proposals were: to actively handle labor welfare cases, to actively promote cooperatives in various districts, and to guide cooperatives specializing in credit business to revitalize finance; and to negotiate compensation for losses in the War of Resistance, to provide full relief to the victimized compatriots to alleviate the people's difficulties and comfort their hopes. Regarding the valuation of losses, it should be based on current prices. The original method of the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee, which was based on the occupied prices at the time of the material losses, should be requested by the City Government to be corrected by the Central Government.

### Songhu Road Redirection Issue - Resolution to Maintain Original Route

Regarding the question of whether to relocate the Songhu Railway, Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau first explained the method of redirecting the Songhu Railway: The Songhu Railway tracks would be dismantled and moved to the western suburbs of Zhongshan West Road, starting from the point where the Jinghu and Huhangyong railway tracks connect in a straight line, so that Zhabei is laid within the Songhu route, and the original roadbed is rebuilt into an asphalt road, with the addition of trolleybuses and public buses. This would be of great help to the prosperity of Zhabei and Hongkou.

Councilors believed that the Songhu Railway was the first completed railway in modern Chinese history, and that only a few miles had not been repaired, so they advocated that the original route should be maintained and that relocation was unnecessary.

As a result of the vote, with 76 votes in favor, the original route was maintained, and the Songhu Line was to be quickly repaired and restored.

### Engineering Firm Technician Issue

The Ministry of Interior stipulates that engineering firms must register with one technician. Proposal No. 3 of the Construction Department called for the abolition of this regulation. The reason is that there is a lack of technician talent, and at the same time, the largest buildings in the city, such as the Customs House, Cathay Hotel, and International Hotel, Sassoon House, etc., were all contracted by engineering firms based on experience, without hiring technicians at all. However, since this method is stipulated by the Ministry of Interior, the Public Works Bureau has no right to abolish it. Therefore, the resolution of the Assembly is: This case should be suggested to the central competent department by the Assembly.

### Hardoon Garden to be Converted into a Park - Assembly Unanimously Approves

Regarding the issue of renting Hardoon Garden as a park in the city to increase places for citizens to relax, Wang Zhuyi stated when the Councilors discussed the Construction Department's proposal yesterday morning: The Hardoon Estate Management Committee had sent a letter to the Councilors, stating that Hardoon Garden was the property of British expatriates, and that they were preparing to build houses to alleviate Shanghai's housing shortage. However, according to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau's explanation: Mrs. Hardoon is Chinese, and the estate should be managed according to Chinese law. At the same time, according to the design of the Urban Planning Committee, that area is not suitable for building houses anymore and should be set up as a park. Councilor Wang Zhengting said: There are too few parks, which has a great impact on people's health. If Hardoon Garden is covered with many houses, it will no longer look like a park. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau should absolutely not allow them to build houses again. They should continue to negotiate with them for rent. Most of the councilors applauded and supported it, and the vote passed.

The City Councilors discussed a total of 32 Construction Department proposals yesterday morning. The reasons for the various proposals passed without dissent are listed below: There are many passengers getting on and off at the North Railway Station, and the traffic is congested. A remedy is proposed. The City Government is requested to strengthen traffic management, open up roads in downtown areas, and increase the number of public buses to facilitate traffic in the urban area. Fill in the Zhaojiabang River, which has been silted up, build a vegetable market at the eastern end, pave a road in the middle, and install a wharf at the western station to improve hygiene and facilitate traffic. Because all the ships of various commercial shipping companies suffered heavy losses during the War of Resistance, a compensation proposal is put forward. Add electric lights in various districts to benefit pedestrians and maintain public safety. The City Government is requested to make the method of prospering Nanshi and Zhabei a preliminary plan for prospering Greater Shanghai. A comprehensive dredging of the Huangpu River is proposed. Remove obstacles on Jiaotong Road. Dredge suburban rivers or build ditches. Install tap water pipes in suburban areas to improve sanitation. Extend the period for gradually abolishing rickshaws. Open a city ferry terminal to facilitate the development of city prosperity. Quickly repair the original roads in the city to facilitate traffic and facilitate people's travel. Improve the management of water and land transportation to ensure safety. Restore suburban vegetable markets to improve the appearance of the city. The city's parks should be strengthened in management across the board. Determine the Greater Shanghai Plan. Students and public education personnel are experiencing economic difficulties and should be allowed to ride for free. Organize a wharf warehouse company to improve shipping efficiency, etc.

### Electricity Restriction - Neon Lights to be Prohibited

Proposal No. 4 of the Construction Department: Prohibit citizens from wasting electricity and expand the power supply to benefit industry. This sparked a fairly heated debate. Ma Shaoquan said: The use of electric heating should be equal. It is too unfair for some people to enjoy it and some people not to enjoy it. Therefore, the current constant heating with electricity should be completely removed. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau explained the current electricity shortage situation: "The reason why there is an electricity shortage now is because the machine repair is delayed. We want to ask the citizens to help solve it. Regarding neon lights, we are also preparing to issue an order to prohibit them until the end of February next year." Speaker Pan said: "We see at night that many shops have closed, but the electric archways are brightly lit. It is really necessary to prohibit them. Only fair and reasonable methods can convince people. Those who do not have coal stoves or stoves, even if they use a little electric heating, will have to be removed. How can people eat!" Shanghai currently generates 63 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per month. Excluding the amount consumed by the power company itself, the actual amount is 57 million kilowatt-hours, of which two-thirds are used by factories and one-third is consumed by ordinary users. Finally, the resolution passed on electricity conservation was: "The Public Utilities Bureau will determine the method of restricting electricity consumption based on the principle of fairness and reasonableness. It will also encourage factories to purchase their own generators and assist power companies to repair damaged generators to increase power. The electricity saved will be supplied to factories as much as possible to increase production."

### Finance, Land Administration, and Education Proposals - Continued Discussion and Approval

In the afternoon, the discussion of the proposals of the various groups continued. Due to time constraints, the Secretary-General read out the reasons for the proposals, methods, and review opinions. Except for a few minor revisions, the rest were passed smoothly.

The important ones in the Finance and Land Administration area from Finance and Land Administration No. 17 to 25 are: (1) Please ask the government to reduce the amount of the field tax quota and convert it into legal tender to relieve the people's difficulties. The City Government will quickly formulate a concrete plan for converting it into legal tender based on the price of cotton and forward it to the Central Government for adoption and implementation. (2) Rectify the discipline of the tax collection personnel of the city's tax collection agencies to stop corruption. The City Council will notify the City Government to send letters to the tax collection agencies to implement it. (3) It is proposed that the government consider reducing the income tax levied on the wages of employees and implement it from September. The method will be sent to the City Government for forwarding to the Central Government for approval. The others passed are: (1) It is recommended that the City Government centralize and unify the payment of materials to reduce manpower and material resources and reduce malpractices. (2) It is proposed that the government levy import tariffs on imported cigarettes at the same rate as domestically produced cigarettes according to market prices to achieve equality and maintain the national cigarette industry.

(3) Allocate a portion of the Japanese reparations and enemy and puppet materials to handle the city's construction matters. (4) Please ask the City Government to conduct a general survey and registration of public and private vacant land in the city and aim for rational use to improve the appearance of the city and make the most of the land. (5) The collection of business tax will be assisted by the industry associations of each industry to the Finance Bureau to increase the city's revenue. (6) Please ask the City Government to forward it to the Central Government to formulate laws and regulations as soon as possible to enable farmers to have their own land, so as to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of equalizing land ownership and to be a leader for all provinces and cities.

### Private School Tuition Issue Sparks Debate Again

In addition, Case No. 6 of the Finance and Land Department, which was retained during the previous discussion, requests that the government stipulate that the original tenant of a fixed-term lease of a house has the right of first refusal. Because the Legislative Yuan has recently sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate housing disputes and formulate lease regulations, it was decided to send it to the City Government for forwarding to the Legislative Yuan for adoption and revision. In the educational proposals, the issue of private school tuition sparked considerable debate. Huang Bingquan and Bu Guoxian believed that private school tuition was too high and that the principals were making money. Therefore, they advocated that tuition should be charged according to the minimum amount stipulated by the Education Bureau and should be paid in installments. Zhan Wenyu, on the other hand, believed that most private schools were making up for the lack of municipal schools under difficult conditions and solving students' schooling problems. Therefore, there was no need to be critical of tuition fees. The final decision, in addition to the original methods (1) The tuition fee standards of private schools should be determined by the Education Bureau based on the price situation at the time and the actual needs of each school, and strictly supervised to ensure compliance. (2) Private schools should stipulate free and half-free places. Free places should not be less than 20%, and half-fee places should not be less than 10%. (3) The City Government should order the school boards of each school to be fully responsible for planning the funds of each school and reviewing their income and expenditure accounts. In addition, one more item should be added: The tuition fee standard for the next semester should be agreed upon by the Councilors when the Education Bureau sets it.

National schools should be actively increased, and the principle of balanced development in the suburbs should be followed. The Education Bureau should formulate concrete school construction plans and implement phased construction in order to achieve the popularization and improvement of national education in the city.

Municipal Schools

Municipal primary schools should no longer collect disguised tuition fees in any name in the future. Municipal middle schools should not arbitrarily collect teacher appreciation money to ease the burden on citizens. The base salary of municipal school teachers will be adjusted and increased by the Education Bureau based on the principle of fairness.

There are not enough schools, and many students are out of school. In order to remedy this situation, it is recommended that the Education Bureau change all municipal and private large, medium, and small schools to a two-part system of classes to increase the number of places and prevent students from being left out.

Various Educational Proposals Passed

In addition, the proposals passed are (1) Please ask the government to encourage the establishment of private schools and provide subsidies to popularize education. (2) Please organize various welfare matters related to educational practitioners and appropriately increase teachers' salaries to improve the education industry. (3) Please ask the City Government to universally develop secondary vocational schools and prepare for the establishment of a women's normal school. (4) Please ask the government to quickly provide relief to private schools destroyed during the War of Resistance to show encouragement and promote education. (5) The city lacks school buildings. Please ask the municipal government to implement remedial measures separately. (6) Please ask the City Government to universally establish public schools and remedial schools to separately accommodate out-of-school people. (7) Organize an educational inspection team to go abroad to inspect education. (8) Each private primary school should be assisted and supervised by the local district office to facilitate improvement. (9) Use the radio station to add educational programs to instill knowledge in the public. (10) Girls' schools should add courses on obstetrics and gynecology and infant knowledge. (11) Please ask the government to pay special attention to science education and promote science standardization. (12) Please ask the government to promote family education, pay attention to mother education, and establish special personnel to take special responsibility. (13) Please ask the government to organize cultural undertakings loans. (14) Encourage the increase of public and private libraries. (15) Universally promote physical education to save the weak and revitalize the national soul. (16) Please ask the government to award and assist education and cultural undertakings to improve the academic and cultural level and change the social atmosphere. (17) Please ask the government to allocate special funds to renovate the Temple of Literature within a time limit to show respect for Confucius and protect public property. (18) Please ask the City Government to consider building an art gallery in the city center to display ancient and modern art and cultural relics so that everyone can appreciate them. (19) Please ask the City Government to select and implement an order to the Education Bureau to unify public education institutions and determine the central goal to save public funds.

### Various Public Utilities - Can be Privately Operated and Officially Supervised

Regarding the unification of tram and public bus routes, increasing the number of vehicles, and improving traffic, it is proposed that the Public Utilities Bureau be responsible for urging the companies to implement it to restore order. This is the reason for Proposal No. 5 of the Construction Department. However, the first item in the review opinion is: Various public utilities should be operated by the state in principle, but when the government is in financial difficulty, they may be operated jointly by government and business, or privately operated and officially supervised. However, Xu Yongzuo believed that in the current autumn of government financial difficulties, there is no need to sing high tunes. Since the country cannot come up with the money, it is better to simply return it to private operation. Moreover, everyone has seen how well state-owned enterprises have performed. Therefore, he advocated that various public utilities should be operated privately and officially supervised in principle at present. Wang Zhuyi's statement was: The principle of state-owned operation is based on central laws and regulations, and there is a proviso in the review opinion, which is actually exactly the same as Councilor Xu's opinion. Finally, Councilor Wang Zhengting stood up and suggested: "Various public utilities should be operated privately and officially supervised in principle, unless otherwise stipulated by central laws and regulations." When voting, Councilor Wang's proposal passed with a majority of 79 votes.

### Horse Racing is Still a Mystery - Final Resolution is to Request the Central Government to Interpret the Gambling Portion - While Requesting the City Government to Negotiate to Take Back the Racecourse

[This newspaper] The "horse racing problem," which has attracted the most attention from the City Councilors and on which they have expressed the most opinions, but which has not been resolved for a long time, was finally brought up at the meeting yesterday before the adjournment for an unprecedentedly tense and heated discussion that lasted for an hour. Those attending the meeting had been waiting for this wonderful scene for a long time. Yesterday afternoon, just as everyone was feeling disappointed because it seemed that the Councilors meeting was not going to end and the discussion of the "horse racing" case would be postponed again, suddenly the Speaker announced that the Assembly had decided to adjourn, and most of the Councilors shouted "Agree!" So the horse racing problem, which was the highlight of the show, was brought to the stage. Many guests were temporarily attracted to the audience seats. Although the result of the discussion inevitably disappointed those who cared about this matter, it was still a preliminary resolution.

The Speaker had long anticipated that the Councilors would have many opinions on this case, but time was limited, so he specifically proposed to limit the discussion to three points: (1) Whether horse racing is allowed; (2) Whether horse racing is allowed in the central area; (3) How to take back the racecourse.

Zhan Wenyu first represented a citizen surnamed Li to complain that his old home, which used to be located at the racecourse and had 43 mu of land, was forcibly purchased by the British without receiving any money. However, the Speaker reported that the Mayor must first give an explanation before this case is discussed.

The Mayor Explains Two Points

The Mayor said at the beginning: "Please feel free to discuss the horse racing problem openly. The City Government will respect the resolution of the Councilors. Please rest assured." Regarding the origin of this proposal, the Mayor said that the Jockey Club came to request the opening of horse racing. At that time, he thought that the racecourse should be taken back and operated by the City Government. This is based on two principles: (1) The racecourse in the city center should not be used to build more houses, but should be used to leave more open space, build parks, and improve traffic. (2) Shanghai is the largest city in the country, but it still has to borrow theaters to hold grand gatherings, which is a loss of dignity. The City Councilors are planning to use the former Japanese expatriate autonomous association as the meeting place, which is also very difficult. Therefore, in the Shanghai urban plan, it is believed that there is no better place to build a convention center or City Council than this.

"Whether to have horse racing or not is another question," the Mayor continued. "I just want to expropriate the land of the racecourse. Regardless of whether horse racing is gambling or physical education, it should be held in the suburbs. The Jockey Club also admits that this is correct. They have agreed that the City Government can expropriate the land at any time, and there is also a written document promising this."

The Racecourse Land Must be Taken Back

The racecourse land must be taken back. This is what we have decided to do. But "where will we get so much money?" We have also considered this issue in many ways. Let's issue public bonds! This land is used for public meeting places, parks, etc. No one is willing to mortgage it. Therefore, under these difficult economic circumstances, we can only think of the method of "taking the wool from the sheep." When repaying the land price, it is impossible to calculate the price of the 500 mu of land at the racecourse according to the land price of the surrounding buildings. But in the contract signed by the Jockey Club and the Shanghai Daotai, it was stipulated that the racecourse land should never be built on. Therefore, when we negotiate, we may propose that the racecourse land cannot be calculated according to the land price of the surrounding buildings. In this way, the tax revenue from horse racing for two years is about 10 billion yuan, which may be enough to complete the transaction. If horse racing is held in the suburbs, we can compensate them with 500 mu of land plus the cost of the current racecourse buildings, which is more reasonable.

According to the previous contract signed by the official government, and the Sino-American and Sino-British treaties stipulate that "property rights acquired by non-fraudulent means shall not be abolished." I am not flattering foreigners, but Shanghai citizens must respect other people's rights with a great national attitude. If they are not allowed to have horse racing, then they have the right to dispose of their own products. I dare not and do not want to advocate horse racing, but from a construction point of view, not taking back this piece of land would be a huge loss to Shanghai. Therefore, I hope that the Councilors can authorize the City Government to first negotiate with the Jockey Club.

Councilors Compete to Speak

Next, the Councilors competed to stand up and speak. The Speaker then stipulated that they would express their opinions in order. Zhang Zhongyuan came up with two methods: (1) The funds required to take back the racecourse can be raised by the City Government issuing public bonds. (2) Use the position of the Councilors to obtain a portion of the materials from the Enemy Property Management Bureau. The funds from the sale will be used to take back the land. As for horse racing, it exists in foreign countries, but it does not necessarily have to exist in China. The United States has "atomic bombs," why don't we have them when we go abroad?

Long Xia believes that it is impossible to recover the racecourse with the tax revenue collected in two years, unless the Jockey Club can guarantee to the City Government that it will definitely sell it to the City Government at this amount after two years.

Lu Entan "absolutely" does not approve of horse racing, saying: "Horse racing is absolutely gambling." He put forward four points: (1) Selling lottery tickets for horse racing is "absolutely" gambling. He wants to ask whether the city's anti-gambling order has been lifted? Otherwise, the horse racing issue cannot be discussed at all. (2) Assuming that horse racing should not be held in the city center, it should not be held in the suburbs either. Gambling is an immoral thing. Why move an immoral thing to the suburbs? (3) The Provisional City Council once passed a resolution to turn the racecourse into Roosevelt Park. Why is there no news of it to this day? (4) Some people believe that to test whether this City Council has a sense of justice, you only need to look at the resolution on the horse racing issue. Therefore, they requested a solemn decision, and all those who oppose horse racing should stand up.

Wang Zhengting Advocates Holding it in the Suburbs

Wang Zhengting felt that this statement was "not very appropriate." He firmly stated: "I personally do not gamble, but horse racing is not gambling and does not hurt anyone. The main purpose of the Mayor's proposal is how to take back the racecourse. But I do not sympathize with the second point. Allowing them to have horse racing for two years is also "inappropriate." Horse racing should not be held in the city center, as it obstructs traffic. What is it like when all the foreign commercial institutions do not work for three days during a horse race? I advocate going to the suburbs to have horse racing. At the same time, the Councilors should jointly find a way with the City Government to take back the racecourse."

Fei Shusheng's tense expression and momentum attracted the attention of the entire audience. He said: "This is my last speech, and I absolutely oppose horse racing. I want to ask everyone to define gambling. Why is buying horse racing tickets and winning or losing not gambling? If we want to promote physical education, how many swimming pools are there in Shanghai, and how many gymnasiums are there? Horse racing is harmless in the United States, but it is very harmful at the time of China's construction. China is a backward country, and it does not pursue good things but learns bad things. I absolutely oppose it. The people who go to horse racing are not necessarily all rich, and there are also poor people who want to speculate. Whether they are rich or poor, we must love them and teach them. I have many more reasons, but there is not enough time. The Mayor said that the racecourse cannot be taken back without horse racing. This is "coercion," and we cannot be "coerced." Unequal treaties were coerced in this way. This is not approved by the 3.9 million citizens of Shanghai."

Wang Liben and Sun Zhenchun also believe that horse racing involves gambling.

Pang Jingzhou wanted to ease the tense atmosphere. He wanted everyone to pay attention to the original proposal, which only mentioned "horse racing" and did not mention "selling horse racing tickets." As for the Mayor saying that he wants to negotiate, he did not say that he has already negotiated, nor did he say that he is confident, so why not wait until he is confident before submitting it to the next meeting for discussion.

Legal Perspective

Ma Junshuo cited the law to break the deadlock. He pointed out that on September 32, the National Government promulgated (implemented on October 1 of the same year) Article 64, Paragraph 7 of Chapter 3 of the Law on Violations of Public Order: "A person who engages in gambling-like behavior on roads, public places, or places where the public can enter and exit" shall be sentenced to detention of up to seven days or a fine of up to fifty yuan or labor service. Therefore, if horse racing is not "gambling," it is at least "gambling-like behavior" and should be opposed.

Zhu Wenqi realized a fundamental problem. He asked: "If horse racing does not involve selling lottery tickets, where will the tax revenue come from? If it involves selling lottery tickets, is it considered gambling?" He approves of horse racing in the suburbs. Zhang Zhihan stood out with an unpopular view. He "approved" of horse racing. He believes that horse racing is not gambling. Because it is very difficult to take back the land, we must find a way. If we can avoid horse racing in the city, that would be better. Otherwise, I also approve of horse racing at the racecourse. The monthly tax revenue of 300 million to 500 million yuan does not necessarily have to be accumulated. It can also be used as the City Government's expenses to lighten the burden on citizens. If Shanghai prohibits it, why don't Qingdao and Hankou prohibit it? If buying lottery tickets is gambling, then are the previous aviation construction bonds and stock exchange transactions considered gambling?

Whether Selling Lottery Tickets for Horse Racing is Considered Gambling

Jiang Pingshen formally moved to ask the Central Government whether selling lottery tickets for horse racing is considered gambling. If it is gambling, then it conflicts with central laws and regulations and there is no need to discuss it at all.

It was the final time for discussion. Chen Gongda and Qu Yue rushed to speak. As a result, Chen Gongda asked, "If you approve of horse racing, would you approve of your own children going to horse racing?" In the previous Shen Bao test, 59 votes approved of horse racing, and there were still 1,225 votes against it. We should take the public's opinion as our opinion.

Qu Yue ended the entire discussion. He was very dissatisfied with horse racing and frowned, saying: "I have lived next to the racecourse for 50 years. Based on 50 years of experience, I hate seeing horse racing. Foreigners even have holidays for horse racing. I think everyone "does not need to bother" discussing it. I guarantee that this case will not pass.

### Improving Traffic on the Huangpu River - Organizing a City Ferry Company Decided to be a Joint Government-Business Venture

Regarding improving traffic on the Huangpu River and organizing a joint government-business venture for the Shanghai City Ferry Company, these are the contents of Construction Department Proposal Nos. 2 and 19. Several councilors from Pudong, Qu Yue, Lu Huimin, Zhong Yuliang, etc., spoke one after another.

The best way to completely solve traffic on the Huangpu River is to build bridges over the Huangpu River or drill tunnels under the river. Therefore, it was decided to send it to the Public Works Bureau for planning and implementation, and to report to the second general meeting. However, Director Zhao believed that there might not be enough time. Speaker Pan said: It is fine to report a portion first. As for increasing the number of city ferry boats and assisting legitimate private ferries, improving wharves, and other methods, please send it to the Public Utilities Bureau for active implementation.

Regarding the issue of the City Ferry Company, there is one key issue: one is the navigation rights of private ferries, and the other is the term of the City Ferry Company. But in the end, they were both reasonably resolved. For places such as Gaoqiao and Donggou, the City Ferry Company should respect the vested navigation rights of private ferries that had been sailing before the War of Resistance. The term of the City Ferry Company is set at 30 years, but from the 16th year, if the city treasury is abundant, it can be taken back by the City Government. This is because Director Zhao explained that if the term is set at 30 years, merchants will not be willing to invest because the term is too long and they will not be able to earn back their capital, then it will not be successful. As a result, Zhu Wende proposed the above compromise method, which was passed by a majority.

### Final Decision on Two Principles

In the end, the issue was resolved through voting, but resolutions were only passed on two principles: (1) With 80 votes out of 120, "Whether the sale of lottery tickets associated with horse racing constitutes gambling should be referred to the Central Government for interpretation" was passed. (2) With 113 votes, "To recover the racecourse, the Municipal Government is requested to expedite negotiations and report the progress to the next General Assembly of this Council" was passed.

Whether Shanghai will have "horse racing" at all remains to be seen, and we can only await the Central Government's response.

Proposal to Abolish Fuel Control

Following the heated debate on the resumption of horse racing, several temporary motions were raised: (1) Councilor Wang Zhengting proposed: "In order to alleviate the coal shortage panic among Shanghai citizens, this Council, on behalf of the four million-plus citizens of Shanghai, suggests to the Central Government authorities the abolition of fuel control by the Fuel Management Committee, so that citizens can freely purchase, transport, and sell fuel to alleviate the people's difficulties," which was resolved and passed. (2) Councilor Chen Peide proposed: "In view of the recent continuous rise in prices, it is proposed that the Municipal Government, in conjunction with various trade associations, discuss effective measures to curb the situation," which was resolved and passed. (3) Councilors Shen Ding and others proposed: "It is proposed that the Municipal Government order the Municipal Education Bureau to promptly adjust its affiliated institutions, reduce expenses, and promote national education," which was resolved and passed. (4) Councilors Shen Ding and others proposed: "The collection of various fees by national education classes should be strictly prohibited," which was resolved and passed. (5) Councilors Chen Ruhui and others proposed: "It is proposed that the Municipal Government request the Respect Teachers Movement Committee to allow the allocation of the remaining more than 60 million yuan of Respect Teachers donations to the Municipal Education Loan Committee for the tuition fees of the 9,000-plus loan applicants of this year. We respectfully request a public vote on this matter," which was resolved and sent to the Education Bureau for consideration and implementation. (6) Councilor Wu Zhengkuo proposed: "It is proposed that the Municipal Government promptly comply with the Executive Yuan's order to allocate all the buildings of the Huangpu Police Precinct to the Municipal Court for use." It was quickly resolved to request the Municipal Government to promptly allocate suitable buildings for the use of the Municipal Court. (7) As delegated by the Speaker, the resolution on the Council's declaration and the reports on the administration of various bureaus will be refined by Councilors Tao Baichuan, Feng Youzhen, and Jiang Pingfan, then published separately and forwarded for implementation, which was resolved and passed. (8) As delegated by the Speaker, the temporary motions that the Council's General Assembly did not have time to discuss will be submitted to the Council's various specialized committees for review and handling, which was resolved and passed. (9) As delegated by the Speaker, the petitions accepted by the Council's General Assembly will be submitted to the Council's various specialized committees for handling and forwarded to the Municipal Government for implementation, which was resolved and passed.

### Organizational Rules for Various Committees Amended and Approved

The Council amended and approved the "Organizational Rules for Various Committees of the Shanghai Municipal Council" yesterday morning, totaling ten articles. It stipulates the establishment of eleven committees, including Autonomy, Finance, Land Administration, Education, Society, Police Administration, Public Works, Public Utilities, Budget and Final Accounts, and Regulations. Each committee shall have three conveners and shall meet once every two weeks. The various committees are formed by volunteer participation of councilors, but each councilor must participate in at least one and at most two. The number of members of each committee shall be at least fifteen and shall not exceed thirty-five.

### Deputy District Director of the Central Statistics Bureau Dies from Accidental Gun Discharge During Official Business

[Report from this newspaper] Zou Ya'fu (from Sichuan, 40 years old), Deputy Director of the 11th District of the Central Statistics Bureau in Xiaoshichiao, Pudong, visited the room (No. 602) of his friend Zhang Yongjiang, a hardware merchant, at the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road at 8:00 PM yesterday. At 11:45 PM, Zou attempted to unload the bullets from his own pistol, but inadvertently triggered it, accidentally injuring his chest, resulting in immediate death. The hotel reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Precinct. Director Shi personally led officers Zhang Guodong and others to investigate. Upon hearing the news, the General Bureau also dispatched a photographer to the scene to take pictures of the situation. According to Zhang Yongjiang, Zou and he had met in Chengdu, and Zou had no family in Shanghai. Since opening the room on the 12th, Zou came to visit almost every day, but unexpectedly this happened.

### Adopting an Attitude of Not Being Overly Demanding but Not Relaxing Towards the Municipal Authorities; Upholding the Principle of Not Wasting but Not Being Stingy Towards Citizens' Burdens; Declaration Issued at the First General Assembly

This Council was established on the anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. Since convening on the 9th of this month, it has been two weeks and two days. In accordance with the procedural rules of this Council, all reports, inquiries, discussions, and resolutions have been completed successively. At the beginning of this General Assembly recess, we respectfully inform the elders of the city and the municipal authorities of the important aspects of the deliberations and future expectations.

Shanghai has a history of over 100 years since it was opened as a commercial port. Through various efforts, it has long become an important center of finance, industry, commerce, and culture in our country, known as the most prosperous international city in the Far East. However, in the past, due to the existence of concessions, the division of governing power, local autonomy could not be completed, and a representative body of public opinion could not be born. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the national territory has been restored, the unequal treaties have been abolished, and the Shanghai municipal administration has achieved unification. This Council convened its first General Assembly on the anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance, exercising its powers on behalf of the people of the city in accordance with the Municipal Council Organization Regulations, with particular emphasis on the examination of budgets and final accounts. Towards the municipal authorities, we adopt an attitude of not being overly demanding but not relaxing; towards the citizens' burdens, we uphold the principle of not wasting but not being stingy. The citizens are like shareholders, this Council is like the board of directors, and the Municipal Government is the management. This Council is the organ that determines policies and supervises the Municipal Government, and it should fully exercise its powers in accordance with laws and regulations. During the meeting period, this Council has listened to reports and raised questions to various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government, as well as the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai agencies, the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions. Various proposals have also been discussed separately and resolutions have been made, which have been sent to the relevant agencies for implementation. Among them, the most relevant to the citizens is the review of the Municipal Government's budget for the second half of the 35th year [1946], resolving to reduce expenditures and moderately increase donations and taxes, so as to balance revenue and expenditure. At present, the value of the currency is declining, prices are fluctuating, and there are many things to be done, which are urgent. Finance is the mother of all governance. If we want to carry out municipal construction, we must raise funds to meet the needs. In order to ensure that municipal expenses and citizens' burdens are taken into account, this Council cannot but moderately accept the Municipal Government's proposal to implement new taxes. However, the revenue from new taxes is designated for construction expenses, in line with the principle of taking from the people and using for the people. As for administrative expenses, we strongly urge the Municipal Government to reduce them as much as possible and continue to cut unnecessary expenses in order to save unnecessary expenses. Whether the Municipal Government's budget can be implemented in accordance with this principle in the future, this Council has decided to adopt a strict stance to supervise it and use this as a standard for evaluating the work of the Municipal Government. In the future, with the existing funds available for municipal construction, it can be expected to be gradually promoted and developed, making Shanghai a first-class international city.

After this Council recess, eleven committees will be established to assist the Speaker in continuing to exercise powers, supervise the Municipal Government, and listen to the opinions of the citizens. The various committees will strictly assess and urge the administrative facilities of the various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government to implement the resolutions of this Council, in order to avoid the drawbacks of making decisions but not implementing them.

After eight years of the War of Resistance, industry and commerce in this city have declined, people's livelihoods have been difficult, and municipal construction has been left undone in many aspects. Rescuing the industrial and commercial crisis, solving the housing shortage, organizing traffic, and increasing the number of schools are particularly urgent. Although this Council has exhausted its knowledge and ability to pass some solutions, regarding rescuing the industrial and commercial crisis and promoting reconstruction and reconstruction, this Council has also resolved to send a delegation of eleven people to petition the Central Government, making statements in the hope that the central government can strongly promote the revival of the city and accelerate the construction of a new Shanghai based on the Three Principles of the People. However, since this matter is of great importance, we still hope that all citizens will jointly assume responsibility, each doing their best to achieve success.

Shanghai is an international city with more than four million Chinese and foreign citizens. Among them, many foreign citizens of friendly countries have lived in this city for a long time and regard it as their second home. This Council treats all residents of the city equally, regardless of nationality or occupation, and without discrimination. If citizens have high opinions on municipal administration, we hope that they will provide them to the various committees at any time. This Council will accept them as much as possible and submit reports in order to fulfill the obligation of speaking for the people. We hope that you will urge and assist in all resolutions of this Council in order to achieve their success. May the municipal administration be fortunate, may this Council be fortunate. This declaration is hereby made. September 24th, 35th year of the Republic of China [1946].

### Bizarre Murder Case in Yinxian Lane, Nanshi: A Female Corpse Strangled and Moved Here; No Mud on the Bottom of Her Socks, a Handkerchief Tied Around Her Neck; Remains of a Ya Pear and Two Fruit Candies; Garment Shop Employee Heard a Man and Woman Arguing

[Report from this newspaper] On the open space in front of No. 16 Yinxian Lane (formerly Jixiaofang) on Xundao Street, Nanshi, at 7:00 AM yesterday, an unidentified female corpse was discovered, head to the south and feet to the north. The deceased was approximately 27 or 28 years old, wearing a blue floral white-bottomed cloth cheongsam, an undershirt, shorts, and yellow long silk stockings, with no shoes, permed hair, and gold teeth. A light-colored handkerchief was tied around her neck, and there was mud in her mouth and nose. Wang Shijingnan (from Yuyao), a young woman living inside No. 16, discovered the body when she opened the window and reported it to the captain of the 13th Jia, who reported it to the Penglai Police Precinct. Director Yao ordered Chief Yao Yuanlong, along with officers Wu Zhipeng, Wang Muyin, Sergeant Tong Bocha, Fang Gaoshan, and others, to proceed to the address. Outside the back door wall of No. 16, they found a woman's glass hair tie, half a Ya pear, and two pieces of fruit candy next to the body. A crowd of onlookers gathered. Afterwards, the precinct reported to the Municipal Police Bureau, which sent personnel from the photography department to take photos of the scene for family identification. When taking the fingerprints of the deceased, they discovered a rectangular gold ring mark on her right ring finger, but the gold ring was missing. It was also determined that the deceased had been strangled, but the bottom of her socks had no dirty mud, suggesting the possibility that the body had been moved. According to an investigation of the surrounding area, several hours before the incident, an employee of a tailor shop on Jingtong Road faintly heard two men on the road outside the door strongly urging a woman to return to her hometown, while the woman insisted that she would rather die than comply. Then their voices and arguments faded away. It is generally speculated that the above situation may be closely related to this murder case. The police bureau is now hoping that the family of the deceased will come to identify the body so that the case can be solved quickly. However, as of late at night, no one had gone to the bureau to claim the body. When the corpse was lying under a large tree at No. 16, Director Yao gathered the chiefs of the 16th, 17th, and 18th Bao and Jia to inquire door-to-door whether anyone recognized the deceased, but no one did. Then, the foremen of various military uniform factories were summoned to the scene. They stated that those employed by the factories were temporary short-term workers and that there was no roster. However, the deceased had a beautiful face, and her hands did not appear to have done any work. Therefore, the police have assigned two officers to be responsible for investigating this bizarre murder case and have set a time limit to solve it. It is speculated that this murder case may also contain elements of a love affair.

### Chen Guolian Speaks: Shen Ke is a War Prisoner

[Report from this newspaper] During the trial of the libel suit filed by Shen Ke, a former Nazi suspect, against Lundell of the United Press, the lawyers on both sides argued fiercely over whether the German expatriates sent back to their country were "bad guys." Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to Mr. Chen Guolian, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to inquire about the truth. Mr. Chen replied that when our country repatriated German expatriates, they were actually regarded as "Prisoners of War" rather than "German expatriates." When the office previously provided proof of Shen Ke's identity at the request of the United Press, it only stated the facts and did not add any comments. The Western newspapers' statement that the office referred to Shen Ke as "Obnoxious" is not consistent with the facts.

### Acting as Agent for Tax Payment and Cargo Pick-up; Unaware of Interception

Continued News of Suspected Smuggling by US Military Officer

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's report on the case of suspected smuggling by a US military officer, involving US lawyer Roger, was said to be that Roger was actually entrusted by the officer, Warner, to bring the goods to customs to pay taxes, but unexpectedly he was intercepted at this time. Warner, a US Navy lieutenant, took advantage of his position to ship a large number of luxury goods from the US to Shanghai via military mail, as his father and brothers worked in various US military locations overseas. Recently, nylon glass silk stockings, lipstick, perfume, and other items were shipped, divided into ten packages, along with a letter. However, because Warner himself had been detained by the US military, he wrote to US lawyer Roger, entrusting him with full authority to handle all cargo pick-up and tax payment procedures. He initially thought that since the offense was smuggling, once the taxes were paid to customs in accordance with regulations, the goods could be legally extracted. However, the District Attorney's Office had obtained a tip-off beforehand and had already sent personnel to the US Navy Post Office at No. 2 Beijing Road to lie in wait with customs and the police. Therefore, as soon as Lawyer Roger picked up the goods and came out of the post office gate, he was intercepted by the waiting personnel.

If the appeal is not accepted, an administrative lawsuit can be filed with the Administrative Court. In the future, if various illegal matters are discovered, they can all be reported to the competent authorities in accordance with legal procedures. It is also heard that after the group returns to Beijing, if there are any unfinished documents, the Joint Office of the Investigation Group will be responsible for receiving and sending them on its behalf.

### Unauthorized Transactions; Two Merchants Penalized

In order to crack down on speculation and manipulation of coarse grains and oil cakes, the Municipal Social Bureau ordered the Shanghai Coarse Grain and Oil Cake Commercial Association to supervise its members, strictly prohibit brokers from entering and leaving the market, curb speculative transactions, and pay attention to illegal transactions by merchants and brokers in order to stabilize oil prices. The bureau also sent personnel to various markets for on-site secret investigations for several days and discovered that two brokers in the market, Zhu Runhong and Shen Jiagu, had engaged in unauthorized transactions. They have been penalized separately: (1) Shen Jiagu, considering that it was his first offense, was ordered to suspend entry into the market for one week. (2) Zhu Runhong, being a repeat offender, was ordered to permanently cease trading in the market.

### Citizens Can Use Checks to Mail Property Tax Payments

[Report from this newspaper] This year's summer property tax collection began on August 1st. For the convenience of citizens, the Municipal Finance Bureau, in addition to stipulating that citizens can use crossed checks with the payee listed as "Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau" along with the payment slip and mail them to the tax collection office in their respective districts, recently negotiated with the Municipal Bank for the bank to assist in collecting donations.

### Forcibly Registering Towboats; Shipping Industry Asks for Cessation

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Commercial Association recently reported that the Caojiadu Boat Registration Office of the Public Utilities Bureau, in conjunction with the Water Police Precinct, is forcing all towboats to register. Any resistance may even result in the detention of the boats. However, according to the Ministry of Transportation's Towboat Management Regulations, mass inspections are the responsibility of the Shanghai Maritime Administration, and the boat licenses are issued by the Ministry of Transportation. Therefore, these towboats do not need to be registered with the Public Utilities Bureau again. The association has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to investigate and stop this practice in order to maintain shipping.

### The Qimei Ship Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Captain Talks About Being Beaten

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Qimei ship transported 48 soldiers of the Armored Instruction Corps from Tianjin to Shanghai, and then transferred to Xuzhou at Dagu Port. Captain Shi Xueliang was unreasonably beaten by the soldiers of the corps late at night. The ship has now returned to Shanghai, and the soldiers involved have disembarked in Tanggu. According to the captain, the personal insult suffered this time is a small matter, but the protection of general seafarers is of great importance. In addition to reporting the incident to the military police in Tianjin, he has also reported the details to the Bureau. He has also reported it to the Association of Mariners, which plans to send a telegram to the whole country within days, demanding protection for seafarers and punishing the perpetrators. It is heard that Bureau Manager Xu Xueyu will also go to Beijing soon to report to the Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Transportation, and other agencies, demanding punishment for the soldiers.

### Shen Fenggang, One of the Special Agents of the Puppet Regime, Continued to Be Tried Yesterday Afternoon; Shen Shubo and Zhou Lunwu's Cases are Transferred Due to Lack of Jurisdiction; Yang Yongrui Sentenced to One Year and Three Months in Prison

[Report from this newspaper] In the case of Shao Shijun, the head of the puppet Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department, and Shen Shushi and Zhou Lunyuan, who concealed Shao's illicit property, the High Court ruled that the cases of the second defendant Shen Shubo and the third defendant Zhou Lunyuan were transferred to the local court for trial due to lack of jurisdiction, while the first defendant Shao Shijun is still wanted.

Yang Yongrui, the public relations officer of the puppet Foodstuff Association, was sentenced to one year and three months in prison and deprived of public rights for two years by the High Court yesterday.

The case of Shen Fenggang, one of the main special agents of the puppet regime, continued to be tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Shen is 35 years old, from Funing. In 1939, he came to Shanghai under the leadership of Li Chuchen to work secretly. Later, he was captured by the enemy and defected to the puppet regime. On August 9 of the same year, Li Chuchen invited the defendant to room 302 of the Cathay Hotel to secretly discuss the assassination of Li Shiqun, with Shen responsible for the inside line. Unexpectedly, Shen reported this news to Li, and Li arrested and killed Li Chuchen and others. In addition, he successively killed Su Shaotao, a member of the Central Party Headquarters' Action Committee in Shanghai, Yu Yanzhi of the Military Intelligence Bureau, and many others. As a result, he was promoted to the chief of the Third Division and captain of the First Special Task Force of the puppet Special Agent Headquarters. When Li Shiqun launched the Jiangsu Qingxiang campaign, Shen served as the Qingxiang Inspection Director and secretly reported to the enemy Gendarmerie to arrest underground workers such as Jiang Yaowen, who were released after a large bribe. During the last trial, the defendant denied all the confessions he had made to the Military Intelligence Bureau and did not admit to any of the charges. Yesterday, Wang Xuenong and other witnesses provided favorable testimony for the defendant. The case was postponed for another hearing.

In addition, the case of Zeng Guangyan, who successively served as the head of the Construction Department and Education Department of the puppet Zhejiang Province, and as the administrative commissioner and Education Department of the puppet Huaihai Province, was postponed for another hearing after the investigation.

In addition, the case of Xue Youwen and Hu Chengson, detectives of the puppet Shanghai Putuo Road Police Precinct who framed underground workers, was postponed for another hearing due to the absence of witnesses. The cases of Fan Cunzheng, a Baojia instructor of the puppet Beiqiao District Township Office in Shanghai County, Zhou Genyao, a small worker of the puppet China Railway Company, and Wu Changgui, who were suspected of being traitors, were all detained for further investigation after the court hearing.

### Overseas Chinese Returning Home; Applications Started

### Even Wheelbarrow Pushers on the Bridge Have Gangs; Homeless Former Soldiers are Humiliated While Seeking a Livelihood; Hand Grenade Used as a Talisman; But Unexpectedly Violates the National Law

[Report from this newspaper] It is said that even the so-called "bridge pushers" who make a living by pushing rickshaws over the bridge have gangs. Therefore, if homeless people who have not joined these gangs rashly try to earn some meager money with their own strength, they will encounter the obstruction of this evil force and even suffer a beating.

Yesterday morning, on the North Sichuan Road Bridge, a 17-year-old boy from Guangdong named Xiong Quanyu was trying to push a wheelbarrow over the bridge, but unexpectedly he was surrounded by a group of local bullies, who threatened to punish him and forbade him from "entering the water." However, the young Guangdong boy was unwilling to be outdone, and in a flash he brought out a hand grenade, declaring that if anyone dared to insult him again, he would rather die together!

Of course, the power of the hand grenade was great. The mob did not expect him to have such an amazing weapon, so they dispersed like birds and beasts. However, at the same time, one of them reported to the nearby police and had him detained at the Huangpu Police Precinct. After being interrogated, he confessed: "I was originally a soldier, but I was recently discharged from the army. I have been unable to find a livelihood and have drifted to Shanghai. When I left, I did not return an old hand grenade. Later, I thought that this dangerous item was not safe to carry around, so after arriving in Shanghai, I buried it at the abutment of the Lao Zha Bridge. Unexpectedly, this time I was accidentally humiliated for the sake of life, and in a moment of desperation, I dug it up, intending to stage a "stratagem of the empty city" to scare them, but unexpectedly I committed the crime of privately carrying military weapons."

Breaking the law should of course be punished, so the police precinct transferred him to the court in accordance with the law. But whether he will have the freedom to "push wheelbarrows on the bridge" when he regains his freedom in the future depends on the facts in the future. But if he encounters beatings again, he will no longer have a hand grenade as a talisman.

### Two Swindlers Arrested for Exchanging Large Bills for Small Bills

Yang Dunhou from Nantong, residing at No. 5 Wangshengfang, Fuyu Road in Nanshi, makes a living by running a cloth stall at the entrance of Puqing Lane on Fujian Road. On the 20th of this month, around 10:00 AM, three middle-aged men in military uniforms approached Yang with two bundles of red Customs Gold Unit notes, claiming to be 200,000 yuan. They asked Yang to exchange them for smaller bills. Yang, seeing their well-dressed appearance, did not suspect anything. Without opening and checking the bundles beforehand, he exchanged them for 500 yuan in small bills, and the men left. Later, upon inspection, he discovered that the outer layer was 100 yuan Customs Gold Unit notes, but the inside was all 5 yuan or 10 yuan legal tender. However, the men had already gone far away, leaving him with nothing but regret. Yesterday, around 5:00 PM, Yang happened to be passing Fuzhou Road and Shandong Road when he saw the same three men from the other day using the same method to exchange large bills for small bills from another villager. Yang stepped forward and exposed the scam, managing to grab one of the three men. The villager also helped to grab another, while the third man escaped. The two men were handed over to the Laozha District Police Station. Upon interrogation, one was identified as Meng Wusheng, 27 years old, from Henan, and the other as Gao Jie, 31 years old, from Anhui. They had previously served in a certain military unit but were now retired. They arrived in Wuxi from Xuzhou on September 11th and came to Shanghai recently, staying in Room 402 of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. The fugitive was named Shi Dingwen. They confessed to using fake bills to deceive naive villagers. They also admitted that around 10:00 AM on September 19th, they exchanged ten stacks of fake bills for 200,000 yuan in legal tender from an unnamed man at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Jinhua Street. On the morning of the 20th, they used the same method to defraud Yang Dunhou's stall of 200,000 yuan. That afternoon, the three of them took a train to Hangzhou for sightseeing. In Hangzhou, they patronized prostitutes and toured the lake. The day before yesterday, they brought a Hangzhou prostitute named Huang Lindi to Shanghai and set up shop in Room 402 of the Far East Hotel. Because they had spent all their money, they attempted to defraud another villager yesterday using the same method. As a result, Yang saw them and they were arrested. After the interrogation and investigation of the two criminals, they will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for legal proceedings today.

### Three Police Officers Prosecuted for Failing to Find Stolen Goods but Extorting Money

[Report from this newspaper] Wang Chunhua, a plainclothes police officer from the Dachang Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, previously claimed to have discovered that workers at the Central Chemical Factory were stealing paint and selling it to a traveler at a certain address in the Sutai Hotel on Fuzhou Road. On July 13th of this year, at 7:00 PM, he invited plainclothes police officers Yang Zufu and Zhou Hongfu from the same bureau to secretly investigate the hotel. They discovered that the guest in Room 228 was a paint merchant, but the guest was out at the time. They only saw a large quantity of paint in the room. The three officers then left. Later, at No. 48 Yu's Residence in Zhabei, they arrested Tan Afu and Wu Jinkun, accusing them of suspicion of theft. Tan and Wu pleaded to be spared detention because it was too late, and the Baozhang (ward chief) guaranteed that they would report to the bureau the next day. The next day (the 14th) in the morning, Tan and Wu went to the bureau with the Baozhang. Wang Chunhua and others interrogated the two men and then took them to Room 228 of the Sutai Hotel to identify the stolen goods. At this point, Tan and Wu did not admit that the paint in the room was what they had stolen and sold. Unable to identify the stolen goods, Wang Chunhua and others beat Tan and Wu and detained them. In desperation, Wu promised Wang Chunhua and others 1 million yuan to settle the matter, and the guest in Room 228, Qian Jingshui, guaranteed the payment. Around 8:00 PM that afternoon, the families of Tan and Wu entrusted Xie Mingshan to deliver 450,000 yuan to Qian Jingshui, who handed it over to Wang Chunhua and others. The remaining amount was paid off the next day (the 15th). Around 9:00 PM on the 15th, Tan and Wu were released. On the morning of the 15th, Wang and others went to the Sutai Hotel to demand the remaining money. Tan and Wu pretended to invite them to drink wine at the Juchang Restaurant on Simalu Road and secretly reported them to the bureau. Wang Chunhua, Yang Zufu, and Zhou Hongfu were arrested and transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The trial was held in the District Court yesterday, and all three defendants denied the charges. The court ordered a retrial at a later date.

### University Graduate Li Zhaohe Accused of Stealing Airplane Parts, Claims He "Took Them Home to Study Out of Curiosity"

[Report from this newspaper] The District Court yesterday opened the trial of a university graduate accused of theft. The defendant, Li Zhaohe, 28 years old, graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department of Datong University and worked as an employee of the Shanghai Electric Power Company in January of the 32nd year of the Republic. On July 31st of this year, Li was riding his bicycle in the suburbs when he passed by the Jiangwan Airport and discovered damaged airplanes on the field, marked with American symbols, and unattended. On the afternoon of August 13th, he brought a hacksaw, steel file, pliers, screw drill, and vise, and rode his bicycle to the airport. He sawed off a control stick and four steel pillars. After police investigation, it was discovered that the aircraft was materials received by the Chinese Air Force in Jiangwan. Li was arrested and sent to the Jiangwan Police Station and then transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The defendant testified in court yesterday: He usually had an interest in mechanical engineering. Out of curiosity, he took the parts home to study them, not knowing that it was against the law. The case is scheduled for sentencing on the 28th.

### Expansion of Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market to Accommodate Street Vendors

[Report from this newspaper] The Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market in Hongkou, after the victory, was actively prepared for restoration by the Bureau of Health.

The two floors below can accommodate more than 1,700 stalls, and there are still vacant stalls available. Applications can be made directly to the Bureau of Health.

### Ministry of Interior Re-amends the Ordinance for the Examination of Water and Land Maps; Prohibits the Newly Published Map by the Shanghai World and Geography Society

[Dispatch from Shishi Society, Nanjing, 24th] In order to prevent domestic publishers from carelessly printing maps of China's waters and land, the Ministry of Interior has re-amended the "Ordinance for the Examination of Water and Land Maps," stipulating that all maps of China's waters and land, except those compiled by the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior, must be approved by the Examination Committee before they can be registered and issued. Maps printed abroad must also be approved by the Examination Committee before they can be issued or sold in China. Further dispatch: The Map Examination Committee of the Ministry of Interior has recently instructed the Nanjing and Shanghai Municipal Governments to prohibit the newly published "World New Situation Map" by the Shanghai World and Geography Society. According to relevant sources, the map was revised and reprinted after January of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), but its content is extremely erroneous, which the authorities cannot tolerate. For example, Taiwan and Korea are still listed as Japanese territories in the map, which is absurd. In addition, the map also incorrectly marks the undetermined boundaries of China, the Soviet Union, India, Afghanistan, and China-Burma, and mistakenly includes important areas west of the Congling Mountains to Jiangxinzhou within the territory of other countries. This not only hinders our country's sovereignty and diplomatic progress, but also degrades our country's culture and national system, and subjects us to ridicule from foreigners. Therefore, it is decided to prohibit the map to show our seriousness.

For the past ten months, the committee's headquarters were located in London and subsidized by the British government, and its secretariat staff were seconded by the British Council.

In a recent broadcast speech, Dr. Huxley compared the work of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in overcoming the spiritual famine and mental poverty of the world with the work of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in combating physical famine and poverty. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has achieved great success in its work in London. The committee has drafted plans for scientific education and cultural relief in European and Far Eastern countries that have suffered war and is preparing to launch education movements in Mexico, China, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and many colonies. The committee has also begun to study the compilation of history, geography, and civics textbooks to eliminate the roots of international friction and misunderstanding. In addition, the committee is preparing to convene a conference on educational broadcasting in Europe, investigate the function of art in general education, and attempt to form a machine for excellent translation. There are also many long-term plans, including plans to use film to facilitate teacher and student education, plans to organize adult education discussions in China and India, and plans to establish an international university, an international youth camp, an international family and social design association, an international drama association, and an international association of applied mathematics.

The association set the price of spot medium sand white at 137,000 yuan, and the price of raw sand was initially 118,000 yuan, and then 119,500 yuan, an increase of more than 5,000 yuan. The Shantou gang offered hundreds of bags of Huanggang green at 115,000 yuan. The Jian gang offered Quanzhou second white at 111,000 yuan to 128,000 yuan, Quanzhou foreign at 125,000 yuan, and Diaoqing at 109,000 yuan.

### Total Amount of Tung Oil Sold to the US

Only 13,000 Tons This Year US Merchants Transport New Machinery to China

[Reuters, New York, 23rd] Only five or six thousand tons of Chinese tung oil have arrived in the United States this year, and the total amount for this year is unlikely to exceed 13,000 tons. In the year before the war, 75,000 tons of Chinese tung oil were imported, and even in 1940, despite the impact of the Japanese invasion, 48,500 tons were imported. Regardless of the fact that Chinese tung oil production is lower than before the war, most of the tung oil produced is distributed to Europe. Tung oil imported into the United States used to account for 75% to 80% of China's total output, but now it has been reduced to 50%. In order to help increase the production of Chinese tung oil, a well-equipped new oil pressing equipment has been transported to China by a trading house in San Francisco.

### Japanese Silk Dumped in the US Affects Sino-US Sales

Recently, Japanese silk was publicly dumped once in the United States, and it is now preparing for a second dumping. The quantity is quite large and the price is cheap, which has greatly affected the Sino-Italian silk business. It is reported that the governments of the two countries have ordered their ambassadors to the United States to negotiate with the United States in order to obtain a reasonable solution to the silk price.

### Yarn and Cloth Prices Surge Wildly, Spinning and Building Quotas Are Too Small, and Prices Are Also Raised, Manufacturers Are Unwilling to Sell Due to Difficulty in Replenishing Raw Materials

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the surge in the yarn market continued, because gold and dollars both rose wildly. The yarn market opened at a jump of 100,000, and there were few sellers. Then, the price gradually rose to 570,000, and buyers did not hesitate to increase the price to absorb it. The rise in people's hearts was unprecedented. As a result, the price of 20-count yarn rose by 150,000 to 200,000 compared with the previous day. Especially the 20-count small and medium-sized yarns were almost on par with the Shuangma, Dafa, and Golden Rooster yarns of large factories. 16-count yarn was even more outstanding, and it was also sold at 1.757 million, the same price as 20-count yarn. The reason for this is that the distribution price of spinning and building has increased sharply in the past two days, and the quantity supplied is extremely small, and there are many people who withdraw their orders, so the market has formed a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Because the procurement of this street and weaving factory is very active, the supply and demand are out of balance, and the trend of rising prices has permeated the market. In general, the price of each yarn has risen by about 10%, and the trend is still extremely stable. At the opening of the cloth market in the morning, people's hearts were still extremely firm, and the opening price of spinning and building was nearly 10,000 higher than the previous period, at 72,000 yuan. People in the market generally believe that the successive increase in the opening price of spinning and building has promoted the sharp rise in the black market. People's hearts are panicked, and white printed twill has soared to a high point of 78,000 yuan. Therefore, the market fluctuation is even more intense. Private factories, due to the difficulty in entering raw materials, have agreed not to sell the only semi-finished products lightly, and must wait until the raw materials are replenished before they can supply them to the market. It is even more difficult for real sellers to replenish their goods. Moreover, the black market exchange rate has risen sharply to the scene of 4,300 yuan. Because of this, people's hearts are even more uneasy, and it is hoped that the spinning and building authorities can generally increase the application amount of purchase orders, so that the market price can tend to stabilize under the situation of rising prices. Today, blue V fine cloth is 82,000 yuan, Sijunzi old goods twill is 90,000 yuan, and Wufu fine cloth is 80,000 yuan.

### Purchase of Japanese Cocoons Rejected, China Sericulture States Position, Very Small Purchase Amount Cannot Monopolize Japanese Cocoons, Japanese Accusations Are Not Reasonable

The China Sericulture Corporation's purchase of Japanese silkworm cocoons was rejected by MacArthur's headquarters. Magana, the textile consultant of the headquarters, also stated that we colluded with American merchants to plan to monopolize Japanese silk for profit. The words were extremely sharp and have aroused astonishment in our government and the public. Officials from our side expressed deep regret over Magana's statement. Ge Jingzhong, the general manager of China Sericulture Corporation, stated the following: (1) China Sericulture Corporation is a government agency for developing the silk industry, guiding private management and improving it. It is not a commercial organization. (2) President Song has never participated in the affairs of the company, but only approved the establishment of the company in order to revive our post-war silk industry.

Serious Losses Suffered by Our Silk Industry During the War

(3) During the Anti-Japanese War, China's silk industry suffered extremely heavy losses. Before the war, there were more than 30,000 silk reeling machines, but now there are only 10,500. One-third of the production machinery and equipment was lost. Before the war, the silkworm cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces could produce 100,000 dan, but now the spring and autumn silkworm cocoons are only more than 70,000 dan. The raw material production is reduced by one-sixth, which is only enough for half a year, and there is still a shortage of raw materials for half a year. Therefore, we urgently need Japanese negotiated cocoons. Last year, Lu Xixiang, the silk special envoy received by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (currently the deputy general manager of China Sericulture), agreed with Tao Sen, the agricultural counselor of the US Embassy, ​​to purchase 300,000 silkworm seeds and 2 million mulberry seedlings for the purpose of reviving silk when he was receiving them in Shanghai, and submitted them to President Truman for approval.

Purchase of Silkworm Seeds and Mulberry Seedlings Approved by the United States

Ordered MacArthur's headquarters to handle it in an exchange method, and it was not successful until March of this year. Because we suffered heavy losses in silk during the war, raw materials were lacking, and factories were at risk of suspension. The company, standing in the position of reviving our silk industry, specially entrusted General Zhu Shiming, our representative in Japan, to purchase Japanese silkworm cocoons in April of this year. After several negotiations, no results were obtained, and it was suspended. It is reported that the Japanese side refused to sell to us because our silk quality was low, frequent labor strikes occurred, and fuel was insufficient. However, the above points are not reasonable. If it is said that our quality is low, our quality in the European and American markets is not lower than Japanese silk. Our silk factories have never had labor strikes. Even if the fuel is insufficient, the silk factories have not stopped production. In order to solve the silk crisis, the company requested our delegation to continue negotiations three weeks ago, and provided various loss investigation statistics materials, and still adopted the barter method. Unexpectedly, Mr. Ma's statement occurred, which is deeply regrettable. (4) Mr. Ma said that I have monopolized the Japanese silk industry with American politicians and industrialists. Check that the 10 million pounds of Japanese silkworm cocoons we purchased this time are only 11% of Japan's savings, only 6% of the new silkworm cocoons savings. MacArthur's headquarters holds a large amount of Japanese silkworm cocoons, how can we monopolize it.

Losses in Silk Industry Should Be Compensated by Japan

(5) The losses of our silk during the war should be compensated by Japan; now, in order to save the silk crisis and maintain the livelihood of the workers, and to purchase Japanese silkworm cocoons by means of barter, MacArthur's headquarters should not refuse in terms of reason and emotion. Before the report from Zhu took over our delegation, we can only regard what Mr. Ma said as a personal statement. We should continue to negotiate with MacArthur's headquarters in order to achieve success.

### Hong Kong Government Prohibits Gold Imports, Huge Imports Mostly Transferred to Mainland China

[United Press, Hong Kong, 24th] Government officials here confirmed today that the Hong Kong government has informally banned the import of gold. It is estimated that the gold imported into Hong Kong in the past month accounted for US$3 million. The most recent batch of 34,000 ounces, mostly Mexican gold coins, was shipped from San Francisco in the middle of last week. According to the report, the authorities have banned imports because they found that gold importers have made false statements about the use of gold. It is believed that most of the imported gold is transported to mainland China.

### Unstable Rice Market: Abundant Supply, Sluggish Sales, but Prices Remain Firm

The rice market continues to receive supplies, with over 11,000 "shi" (a unit of dry volume) registered for purchase. Shops are cleverly taking advantage, causing top-grade rice to recover slightly, rising by a thousand yuan. Medium and lower grades remain stable, while "Baiyuan" rice remains stagnant, dropping by one or two thousand yuan. New and aged "Jing" rice are scarce and firm, but the overall situation remains uncertain. Rice is currently being sorted in warehouses and will be allocated for sale soon. The flour market remains inactive, and there is also a lack of transactions for bran. Due to the arrival of two to three thousand bags of high-quality soybeans from the Northeast, market sentiment has softened, and with Shantou stopping its operations, prices have plummeted by two thousand yuan, entering a slump again. Broad beans are in short supply, rising by a thousand yuan. Wheat from Fujian seems to be losing demand and momentum. White wheat prices are down two to three hundred yuan due to inactivity in the north. Shelled peanuts have dropped by one to two thousand yuan due to the cessation of operations in Southeast Asia. Corn has reappeared downstream, falling by a thousand yuan. Mung beans are neither thriving nor declining, and sesame shows little fluctuation. In the oil market, shipments from Qingdao are being received, causing a shortage of raw oil. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil are in short supply, showing a slight upward trend. Soybean cakes remain stable.

### Establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Supervision Office with Defined Authority: Starting from Specific Points

It is reported that the authority of the soon-to-be-established Industrial and Commercial Supervision Offices of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will not conflict with existing administrative structures. The purpose of establishing these offices is to investigate the allocation of capital, the number of factories, the supply of raw materials, and the needs of the market in each region, as well as various supervisory matters. The establishment of industrial and commercial firms in various localities will still be submitted to the central government for approval through the Social Affairs Bureau. It is believed that after the establishment of the Supervision Offices, the national capital will be allocated effectively, evenly, and rationally, preventing the pre-war situation where capital was concentrated along the coast, creating an abnormal situation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is preparing to undertake planned construction of the national economy. Due to current limitations, it will start by establishing specific points before attempting to implement comprehensive control.

### Formation of the Third Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate Yesterday

Following the establishment of the first and second Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicates of commercial banks, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, the third syndicate was also formed yesterday. The list of members is as follows: China National Products, China Enterprise, China Reclamation, China Encouragement of Industry, Donglai, China, Yongda, Zhizhong, Siming, and China First Trust Company, totaling ten institutions. The merger of the first syndicate with the Central Bank is expected to be signed today or tomorrow.

### Tobacco Industry Delegation Petitions in Beijing Today

[Our Report] The local tobacco industry association, facing business difficulties, plans to request three points from the authorities: (1) Refund the raw material tax collected to the manufacturers. (2) Set the tax rate adjustment period to once every six months. (3) Allow the monthly tax payment to be made by the end of the following month. The association has selected seven representatives to go to Beijing today to meet with Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance and Director Mei of the Tax Bureau to present their case.

### Promoting Mint Production: Taicang Residents Organize a Research Society

[Taicang Report] Before the war, the planting area of mint, a special agricultural product of this county, was about 6,000 mu (a Chinese unit of area), with an annual oil production of over 50,000 jin (a Chinese unit of weight), which was exported to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Southeast Asia, accounting for a significant portion of the export trade. After the outbreak of the war, foreign sales were interrupted, prices plummeted, and people stopped planting. After the victory, foreign trade gradually recovered, and people in Muyi (another name for Taicang) specially organized the Mint Production Cooperative Research Society to benefit the rural areas. It was established on the 15th.

### Overcoat Wool Sells Well

There is continued demand for overcoat wool from customers, with brisk sales in both retail and wholesale. The market is firm due to the scarcity of goods on hand for both buyers and sellers, and few incoming shipments have arrived. Most have not yet been loaded onto ships, and it will be too late when they are imported, so prices are generally firm. However, lower-grade "Yuanchang" overcoat wool is consistently weak, mainly due to the influence of Melton wool, and customer demand is very low. Yesterday, English-made "Kaisui Mi" overcoat wool was quoted at 160,000 yuan per yard, Japanese-made "Kaisui Wei" at 85,000 yuan, "Yapei" at 50,000 yuan, American overcoat wool at 47,500 yuan, "Shililuo" at 55,000 yuan, "Meifeng" at 52,500 yuan, and second-grade herringbone "265" at 33,000 yuan.

### Industrial Raw Materials Prices Soar, Orders Halted

Since the exchange rate adjustment, the prices of most industrial raw materials have only increased by 10-20%, but some have even fallen due to a lack of actual sales. Recently, the black market exchange rate for US dollars has risen sharply, and the sales of various raw materials have recovered well. Therefore, yesterday the market surged across the board. The hot commodity caustic soda rose by 70,000 yuan per barrel. Other items such as soda ash, bleaching powder, Vaseline, and N rosin also rose by 10-20%. It is reported that industrial raw material merchants placed almost no orders abroad in September. According to industry insiders, there are three main reasons: (1) The price of overseas orders is higher than the spot price in Shanghai, and merchants find it difficult to sell their existing stock, so most are stockpiling inventory and not ordering from abroad. (2) Difficulties in shipping goods from abroad have not been resolved, and the arrival date cannot be guaranteed quickly, so it is better to purchase and stockpile spot goods than to place orders. (3) After imported goods arrive in Shanghai, the foreign fees are often comparable to the price of the goods. Handling and unloading costs can be calculated for goods with a higher value, but for those with a large volume and low value, there is often a sigh of reluctance to abandon them and excessive cost to retrieve them.

### Sino-Egyptian Barter Trade: Tea Exchanged for Cotton

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 24th] It is announced here that the Chinese government has proposed a barter system with Egypt, exchanging Chinese tea for Egyptian cotton. The Egyptian government has agreed and will implement it soon.

### Cotton Yarn Processing Industries: Surveying the Required Quantity

Due to the recent surge in cotton yarn prices, the Spinning and Weaving Corporation will re-register and survey various manufacturers to prevent speculation and directly allocate cotton yarn to them. It is learned that the dyeing, weaving, handkerchief, and knitting factories have completed the survey. According to Specialist Shi Quan of the corporation, the hosiery sector, including hand-operated and electric machines, requires 413 pieces per month, and the cotton weaving sector requires 308 pieces of yarn. The survey of the underwear, canvas, and electrical weaving industries is currently underway.

### Third Batch of Raw Silk Purchases: Totaling 375 Bundles

The Central Trust Bureau's third batch of raw silk purchases includes 50 bundles from Fuhua, 30 bundles each from Huaguang and Yongchang, and 30 bundles each from Dingxin, Huaxin, Lunchang, Dali, and Yongtai. The China Silk Company has been sorting the warehouse receipts and inspection reports submitted by various manufacturers in recent days. The documentation for this third batch was completed last night and will be sent to the Central Trust Bureau this morning to begin handling the follow-up purchase matters.

### Large Quantities of Yarn and Cloth Transported North

[Our Report] The southward sales of yarn and cloth have disappeared due to the export ban. The "Hanmin" ship sailed to Guangzhou yesterday, carrying only 331 boxes of tea, 102 pieces of newspapers, 220 bags of wheat, 300 blocks of soybean cake, 984 pieces of medicinal herbs, and 4,000 pieces of general merchandise. The "Zhixin" ship also sailed to Tianjin yesterday, transporting over 2,280 pieces of cotton yarn, over 1,020 pieces of piece goods, over 2,419 pieces of tea, and over 700 pieces of paper.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Dried Longan: New dried longan of various grades have arrived recently, and the quoted price has fallen by 10,000 yuan. However, telegrams from Quanzhou report a rise of 20,000 yuan, so the future market is expected to stabilize.

Lime: Yesterday there was a severe shortage of lime, so the market price rose again, jumping from 13,500 yuan to 15,000 yuan due to the small supply and increased actual sales.

Hardware: Small colored pipes are slightly popular, "Yuan Ding" prices are stable, drawer locks are rising sharply, door locks are slightly better, triangular files are slightly weak, and about 2,000 pieces of "White Brand" grinding wheels have recently arrived.

Timber: The timber market is boosted by fluctuations in various markets, and buyers are eager to purchase. Foreign pine is also becoming firmer after being weak, and fir is also firm.

Tin Foil: The market remained quiet yesterday, with few transactions, because both buyers and sellers are afraid of supplementary taxes due to the requirement to register inventory with the Commodity Tax Bureau, creating speculation and stagnation.

### The Metamorphosis of Washington's Policy After the Downing of the American Plane in the Southern Territory

— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shupu

Tito's Previously Arrogant but Now Submissive Written Confession

[New York News, September 3] American-Soviet diplomacy is always advancing in a tortuous and roundabout way. The scene of Yugoslavia shooting down an American transport plane marks a turning point in the US attitude towards the Soviet Union. Before this "tragedy" was staged, many Americans admired communism. Despite the fact that the political style of communist countries is diametrically opposed to the "democracy" advocated by the United States, people like Les (Dewey's diplomatic advisor) still advocated abandoning America's "democratic" diplomacy and trying to understand the Soviet Union and the even more "progressive" communism than capitalism by compromising and seeking reconciliation. In terms of diplomatic technology, figures like Wallace advocated repairing relations with the "Soviet bloc" in order to establish a false peace. In terms of domestic policy, they advocated emulating the strengths of Soviet economic equality in order to transform the United States itself.

The Efforts of the Left-leaning Diplomats Provoked Great Indignation. The Peace-Loving Prime Minister Took a Boat and Went Fishing. However, the tragedy in Yugoslavia hit the American left-wing dreamers head-on. Acting Secretary of State Mr. Acheson started out as a left-leaning figure in the American diplomatic circle. The day after the plane was shot down, I was in Washington. At the State Department's press conference, I saw him flush with anger, reporting the details of the tragedy and the emergency measures taken by the US government. That day, peace-loving President Truman went fishing at sea, and Secretary of State Byrnes was far away in Paris attending a meeting, so Acheson's responsibility was particularly heavy. His mustache, his British gentlemanly demeanor, speech and behavior made the air around Washington feel as heavy as lead pressing on people's hearts.

The foundation of democratic politics is public opinion, and the public opinion circle roared with anger at the tragedy in Yugoslavia. The most vehement were the Hearst newspapers. The New York American Journal published photos of the aerial heroes who died in Yugoslavia with the headline: "Are we going to let their lives be sacrificed in vain?" The next day, the Journal published the grief of the martyrs' families after receiving the bad news. Mrs. Schleber (one of the dead), mother of Captain Schleber, was weeping loudly on the table. The editors of the Journal commented: "Tito, pay attention, you say that American pilots ignored your territorial integrity, but Tito, you ignored the hearts of hundreds of thousands of American mothers!" On the third day, the family of Sergeant Kang Kuo of Pennsylvania received the news of his death. The Journal published photos of the Kang Kuo family's grief and indignation, and quoted the family's request to "punish the murderers." Next to the photo, the editor wrote: "On August 19, the red fascist executioner Tito shot down an unarmed American transport plane for no reason, murdering our five aerial heroes... These heroes, they have been fighting for several years, defeating the Axis enemy countries. Now that they have won, they are preparing to enjoy the happy life of peace, but they were suddenly killed by the Tito bandit!

"Let our government understand: their death was for obeying orders and for doing their duty. We are a democratic country, and the life of every one of our citizens is priceless. Can't our government make Tito understand? Can't we show Tito and his communist bandits the color of the law?

"Strive for the government to send the murderer to the International Court of Justice and punish him as a murderer should be punished."

The Communist Party Only Fears the Strong: American Newspapers Oppose the Public Release of Atomic Bombs

The American Journal mobilized for more than a week to "redress the grievances" of the tragedy in Yugoslavia. Other newspapers, such as the World Telegram and the New York Daily News, all "condemned" Tito's crazy behavior. The New York "Afternoon News", which has always been very left-leaning, also loudly called on the government to firmly accuse Yugoslavia. The word "Tito" has now become a common headline in New York newspapers. Tito's photos, like Hitler's in the past, are published in various ways. In many newspapers, the name "Tito" is preceded by "Communist Puppet Leader" or "Stalin's Puppet Regime".

The State Department's attitude is also following public opinion. The first time I saw Acheson, he only asked for the release of several pilots imprisoned by Tito. The Tito government, after being instructed by Molotov in Paris, complied with the release. The second time, Acheson asked Tito to apologize and guarantee that the same thing would not happen again, and Tito did so. The third time, Acheson asked Tito to give honor to the victims and hold a grand memorial service. Tito sent the Fourth Army of the Yugoslav Army to attend the funeral and memorial service, and he did so. Later, the State Department asked Tito to make a written "confession" and guarantee that there would be no similar incidents in the future, and to submit it in writing to the US State Department for the record. It is said that Tito also wrote it. However, the American public opinion and discourse have not yet calmed down. Therefore, Acheson asked Tito to compensate and provide compensation, and it is expected that he will also do so.

One American reporter said that to deal with the Communist Party and its running dogs, you have to hit them hard so that they can't recover. He said, "If a good person gives way, a bad dog will take two steps forward. If a good person kicks back, the bad dog will have to run away."

I don't know what the people of Yugoslavia think about this matter. In the United States, Americans compare it to a microcosm of the Pearl Harbor incident. Americans now understand: what is true peace? On Labor Day, the New York Daily News, which sells 4.6 million copies a day, wrote an editorial commemorating Labor Day and Victory Day. The final conclusion was: "If we now tell another country the secret of making the atomic bomb, then we are no different from being naked!" Do the American people agree with this sentence? More than half of the answers are positive! (September 3, New York)

### A Historical Gamble Staged in Sweden: Clever Use of Neutrality to Aid the Allied Nations

— Translated by Cheng Zhi from the September issue of Reader's Digest

During World War II, a historical gamble was staged on the Scandinavian peninsula, which only a few senior British and American officials understand to this day. This Sweden, which has always been considered pro-Nazi, has been continuously assisting the Allies with important military supplies and various intelligence since the outbreak of the war.

Only two senior Swedish officials know that all important intelligence obtained by the Swedish intelligence agencies is sent to the United Nations Embassy, including details of Hitler's headquarters' daily operations and the V-1.

Sweden is completely surrounded by German forces, so she can only feign neutrality, but in the first year of the war, a large number of rollers and other important equipment were secretly transported to the UK and the US. In 1940, a revolutionary new weapon - the Bofors 40 cm caliber anti-aircraft gun - was secretly transported from Sweden to the United States. Since then, the United States has continuously imitated and manufactured thousands of them. Senior Swedish generals were sweating profusely in the dark armory, secretly boxing and packing machine guns, hand grenades, etc. for the Norwegian underground workers.

After many weeks of investigation, I only knew that a small part of the business and government leaders were involved in this secret work, and they were convinced that Germany would be defeated without a doubt. Of course, there were also many who sympathized with Germany, and a small number of naval and land generals were considered pro-Nazi.

The Nazis insisted on absorbing all of Sweden's exports, but she firmly opposed it. What she wanted was complete free trade. The Nazis demanded more iron ore than before the war, but Sweden not only refused, but actually reduced it by a quarter.

Since the beginning of the war, Sweden's intelligence work has been one of the most accurate and reliable in Europe.

Sweden's intelligence was largely due to many high-ranking German officials who discriminated against Hitler.

On March 30, 1940, a certain doctor visited Mr. S, a Swedish businessman, who was a close friend of a Hitler aide. He learned that the Nazis would invade Scandinavia on April 9, and that the ships needed for the attack had been concentrated in the northern port of Stettin.

Swedish officials dared not easily believe it, and were half convinced and half doubtful.

The next afternoon, a group of church elders in the port of Stettin enjoyed their Sunday walk as usual, gradually sneaking to the seaside and discovering that a large number of workers were loading military supplies onto forty ships. The intelligence officer immediately notified the Swedish and Norwegian ambassadors in Berlin. That night, Mr. S learned from Hitler's headquarters that the German army was invading Norway and Denmark - not Sweden.

The diplomats in Oslo and Copenhagen did not believe this intelligence. The Norwegian Foreign Minister specially visited the German ambassador, who absolutely guaranteed that the preparation of these ships was for the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium. However, early in the morning of April 9, the people of Oslo were awakened from their sleep by the sound of cannons.

### Maintaining Neutrality and Refusing Nazi Transit

Thereafter, Swedish public opinion was in an uproar, and the anti-German sentiment rose day by day. Hitler's suspicion also increased. Therefore, the Swedish government sent a semi-official diplomatic mission to Berlin to assure Hitler that Sweden would absolutely abide by neutrality, but with the warning that if Germany attacked Sweden, every military, industrial, mining, transportation and communication facility would be immediately and thoroughly destroyed automatically.

Hitler again requested the railway transit to supply grain, medicine, and Red Cross personnel to the Narvik area. This request was granted under duress, but many combat personnel disguised as Red Cross personnel who passed through were detained. In addition, Germany requested that each train be attached with several carriages of military supplies exempted from inspection, which Sweden immediately refused. In order to take intimidating measures, Germany sent a large team of German aircraft to soar over southern Sweden, but Sweden was unmoved and shot down seven of them:

The Allied landing in Narvik was carried out smoothly, and the situation of the German army in northern Norway became extremely unfavorable. Ribbentrop notified the Swedish government that if the request for military transit was refused again, Germany would not hesitate to sacrifice friendship and attack Sweden to relieve the German army in Norway from its crisis.

On the night of May 17, the cabinet convened an emergency meeting. At that time, a large part of the city had been evacuated, and the borders were heavily guarded. The bridges connecting to Norway were all destroyed. The seriousness of the situation is evident. In the meeting, Prime Minister Hansson was serious and his words were impassioned. He was a steady and quiet person, but in the end his speech trembled slightly "... If we refuse, then we may be invaded and fall immediately. If we allow it, then Norway will become our eternal enemy." After a pause, he continued, "But I think it is better to die a glorious death than to live a shameful life, so this unreasonable request must be rejected."

Everyone agreed without a single dissenting vote.

In the spring of 1942, Germany again planned to attack Sweden. Hitler needed the Swedish railway as a transportation line for the war against the Soviet Union. The preparation plan was completed in January, and it was prepared to mobilize 45 divisions of troops from Denmark, Norway and northern Germany to jointly invade by sea and land. The date was also chosen in late February. However, at the end of January, Sweden received intelligence and immediately mobilized the entire country to prepare for battle.

General Debuk was furious at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin, because Swedish intelligence personnel had revealed their actions without reservation, so he demanded that another 20 divisions be added to conquer Sweden. At this time, Hitler was busy with the war against the Soviet Union, and he did not have time to allocate this army for the time being, so he gave up the idea. Sweden was able to survive.

### Underground Activities: Escorting Atomic Experts

The amazing deeds of the underground workers in Sweden, Denmark and Norway are truly amazing. Their first great achievement was to find a way to guide the Danish physicist Bohr safely to Sweden, and then to the United States. He was an important figure in the development process of the atomic bomb.

In 1943, Germany decided to massacre more than 8,500 Jews in Denmark. Swedish intelligence personnel had learned of this news ten days ago, so they tried to tell these Jews to gather every night on the Moerma coast facing southern Sweden for rescue.

On this starry night, it was truly an incredible scene. They took rowing boats, bamboo rafts, rafts, wooden doors, wooden boards and even swam. They drifted east in the stormy waves. They were all pale, silent and taciturn, for fear that once they alarmed the German army, they would all suffer. Thin women, men with sad faces, and shivering children flocked in their thousands every night. The Swedish Navy secretly sent countless armed boats, patrolling in the turbulent waves, to prevent German interference. Almost all the Jews in Denmark arrived in Sweden within a week.

Current Affairs Commentary

### One World or Two Worlds?

— Chu Yukun

In the past week, Wallace made a speech that caused a great uproar in American diplomatic circles. It was only calmed down after President Truman issued a statement. However, Wallace's letter to the President on August 23 was published in various American newspapers, causing deep unease among the Secretaries of War and Navy, who had to write to the President to deny it. As a result, the divisions within the US government have deepened, becoming irreparable, leaving President Truman with no choice but to make a decision.

Churchill Advocates Franco-German Cooperation

The waves caused by Wallace had not completely subsided when Churchill delivered a speech in Switzerland on the 18th, advocating that France and Germany should set aside their grievances and reconcile, establishing a European alliance based on cooperation between the two countries. He said, "The first step in rebuilding Europe must be through Franco-German cooperation; only in this way can France restore its leadership in Europe; without a great Germany, Europe cannot be revived."

Although Churchill has retired from British politics and is living in Switzerland, given his personal prestige, his statements and advocacy are still valued by various countries. We have no reason to object in principle to his advocacy of Franco-German cooperation; however, Churchill has given several speeches in the past year, first in the United States, advocating Anglo-American cooperation; then in France, advocating an Anglo-French alliance; and now in Switzerland, advocating Franco-German cooperation. Putting all these proposals together, one cannot help but suspect that Churchill intends to organize a Western bloc to resist the Soviet Union. We hope for international peace and cooperation, but we cannot casually endorse any proposal to divide the world into two.

Wallace Resigns to Continue the Struggle

The clamor for "one or two worlds" has not disappeared, and we hear Wallace shouting for "one world." After speaking with Secretary of State Byrnes on the 19th, President Truman decided to order Wallace to resign. According to President Truman's explanation, "The government still supports the foreign policy adopted by Secretary of State Byrnes. The people are of course absolutely free to express opinions that disagree with the government's policy, but the government itself must maintain consistency. Now, it is clear that Secretary Wallace has a 'fundamental conflict' with the government; the only solution is for him to resign. At the same time, I also believe that Mr. Wallace would rather express his views freely as a citizen." Wallace immediately resigned as ordered, without being discouraged, and said optimistically, "I have decided to continue fighting for peace. I believe that the American people can, with the heroic spirit of the late President Roosevelt, join the struggle I lead."

Only One World Can Have Peace

After his resignation, Wallace was free to express his views, and he gave a speech on the 20th, first explaining the reasons for his resignation: "Striving for peace is more important than high office and generous salary." Then he explained his ideal of "one world." He said, "I do not agree with dividing the world into two, and I will continue to advocate the principle of living in one world; there is no peace except for 'one world'." At the same time, he also criticized the errors of the US government's foreign policy, saying that it had failed to recognize the "basic facts" that led to the two world wars, and now threatens a third world war. But the third world war will be a "nuclear war." This serious warning is worth pondering by those who advocate "two worlds."

Paris Peace Conference at an Impasse

Secretary-General Sharq of the Peace Conference, in accordance with the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers, personally stipulated that all committees of the Peace Conference must complete their work by October 5, so that the United Nations General Assembly can be held as scheduled, but there are still many difficult issues that have not been resolved: the most important of which are (1) the Trieste issue; (2) the disposal of Italy's former colonies; (3) the issue of free navigation on the Balkan Danube; and (4) the issue of Italian reparations, with fourteen countries making reparation claims, none of which have been resolved.

US Will Strive for the Success of the Peace Conference

US Secretary of State Byrnes has won a victory at home, but the difficulties he faces still exist. Therefore, Byrnes must redouble his efforts to ensure the success of the Peace Conference. Otherwise, his position will be shaken. Fortunately, the four foreign ministers are all in Paris, and the Council of Foreign Ministers is expected to reopen to resolve these outstanding issues as soon as possible. If the Council of Foreign Ministers still cannot resolve the issues, then a meeting between Truman and Stalin is also very possible. (September 23)

### Population Increase and Decrease in European Countries After the Second World War: All Countries Decreased Except Germany

### A Serious Problem! Post-War Germany: Reduced Land, Increased Population

— Translated from the New York Times Magazine by Nan

The International Committee for the Study of European Problems recently held a meeting in London, attended by experts from many European countries. The theme of the discussion was the impact of the Second World War on the population of Germany and the Allied countries of Europe. The committee submitted a report, which began with the sentence: "The German National Socialist Party not only wanted to conquer territory, but also wanted to increase the German population and weaken the population of neighboring countries, so that it could maintain the superiority of the German nation in the years to come."

Hitler had this goal very early on, and he and his Germans had been moving towards this goal in many ways for many years. Their methods were to encourage marriage and reward childbirth before the war, so that they could have sufficient "biological reserves" after the war began; to do their best to improve air defense facilities and protect civilians; to try to maintain a considerable amount of rationing to maintain the health of the people; and to maintain the normal birth rate during the war. In addition, the most noteworthy point is that most of the Allied countries conscripted women to participate in military and factory work, while German women were not subject to compulsory service, so they could continue to give birth to Germans.

We can find a significant difference by comparing the impact of the First World War and the Second World War on Germany's birth rate. During the four years of the First World War, Germany's birth rate decreased by three million people compared to the usual four years, while in the first four years of the Second World War, Germany's birth rate decreased by only 750,000 people.

In addition, Germany's wartime death toll was also lower than that of European countries. The total number of German military and civilian deaths was 3.6 million, while the total number of military and civilian deaths in European countries opposed to Germany was about 15.4 million.

In addition to massacring combatants as much as possible, Germany also used direct and indirect methods to kill and abuse Jews and people in occupied countries whom they considered undesirable, thus causing the people of Germany's enemy countries to suffer even greater losses.

Germany was indeed victorious in the population war, but it failed in the territorial war. According to the eastern border set by the Soviet Union and Poland for Germany, it lost a quarter of its land, but Germany's population is about 72 million, an increase from 67 million in 1935. One of the important reasons for the increase in Germany's population is that Germans who were originally abroad were gradually repatriated to their home country. As a result, more people have to be accommodated on three-quarters of the land than before, which is indeed a serious problem in post-war Europe.

Before the Second World War, the three Axis countries of Germany, Japan, and Italy used to advocate small land and large population as an excuse to invade other countries. This excuse will of course not be allowed to exist again in the future. In fact, Germany's population density is not denser than that of the United Kingdom or Belgium. As long as Germans work hard to develop their own land and fully exert their inherent abilities, they can still build a stable and prosperous country. However, the current fragmentation of Germany and the barriers between East and West do make Germany's normal development very difficult, and may even lead to a serious crisis. This situation is certainly not a blessing for the German people, but on the other hand, it is by no means a blessing for the Allied countries. Therefore, European politicians should have a broad vision and a prudent attitude to find a reasonable solution to the German problem, which obviously has a decisive effect on the future of Europe.

Spring and Autumn

### The Story in the Cave

— Shenmo

Late autumn, the sun shoots out its last faint light, dragging its heavy and tired body, and hides in the mountain col to the west. A touch of red light on the horizon fades into a pale gray. The sky darkened.

The village, after the baptism of artillery fire, is in a desolate state, especially the ancient Mei Village, which appears even more decadent and dilapidated. There is no one on the square in front of the village, only a dying old dog curled up, shivering and weeping in the west wind of dusk.

In the village, the dilapidated wooden doors are all locked; only the door of Mei Lao's house is still open. Inside the door, under the trembling, dim candlelight, many people are sitting silently. Next to them are their bedding. The air is so silent.

"Why hasn't he come yet?... It's getting dark." The old Mei Lao, sitting near the door, looked anxious, scratching his bald head, which looked shiny in the candlelight, and grumbled annoyedly.

A month ago, in the season when osmanthus fragranced the air, the Japanese began to occupy this place. Thus, murder, arson, rape, and looting... were constantly being created by them; and were constantly swallowing the hearts of every living person. They felt that all kinds of misfortune would happen to them, and at the same time felt that the black shadow of death was pressing down on them tightly...

How many poor people were killed for no reason; how many poor people had their houses burned down, even lost their lives...

Mei Village, a small village, although it has not suffered any misfortune, yet at night, the shrill gunshots, the mournful cries, the cries for help... No one can sleep.

Therefore, someone proposed digging a cave and living in it at night. Everyone thought the idea was not bad, because the cave was much safer than their homes, and they could sleep soundly at night without having to worry. Thus, the cave was dug.

Today--the first day the cave was completed, everyone could have gone to the cave long ago, but they were still waiting for someone--Tao Xiaoliu. He was a guerrilla member familiar to the village. Because he was curious about living in the cave, he asked to join their group and live in the cave. What could everyone not agree to? On the one hand, he was an acquaintance, and because he had a weapon, he could at least embolden everyone.

"He's here--hey!... He's here, Xiaoliu--" Mei Lao suddenly turned around and said to everyone.

Outside the door, the sky was dim. On the gray ridge of the field, a black shadow was rushing towards the village.

Tao Xiaoliu walked into the house. The candlelight shone on his sturdy body, which was young and still a little boyish. However, he looked determined and decisive. A shiny pistol hung at his waist.

"Let's go! I'm a little late. It's getting dark, and it's hard to walk on the road!"

Everyone stood up, carried their bedding, and stepped onto the narrow, earthworm-like ridge.

The cave was only half a li away from the village, but it was difficult to walk. The surroundings were dark and full of terror. The willow trees by the cave in the distance were dancing in the darkness...

The cave was a large hole, ten feet long and wide, with a wasteland above it; in front of it, a clear stream flowed past, the cave door facing it; next to it, a large willow tree sheltered the entrance of the cave door.

Everyone crowded into the low doorway one after another. The first thing they felt was the smell of newly dug soil--musty, depressing, making everyone frown involuntarily. There was no way, they groped in the dark to spread out their bedding and lay down...

However, it was not as peaceful as they imagined. Except for the children, everyone was tossing and turning on their beds, listening to every sound, worrying about a misfortune happening, and remembering their homes in the village... Even Xiaoliu, who had experienced suffering, could not fall asleep.

"Sigh! This life!" Someone sighed.

Suddenly--

"Bang... bang... bang..." "Gada gada gada..."

After the long gunshots, came the rapid-fire machine guns, so close, so shocking...

"What--they're firing?" Everyone in the cave was startled and suddenly sat up.

"Wah--" The child woke up from a sweet dream and cried at the top of his lungs.

"Don't cry!" The father shouted.

"Ah! Good boy, darling, don't cry, good boy, don't cry..." The mother coaxed, trembling.

It was no use, the child cried so loudly. Everyone felt terrified and blamed them.

"You little devil! Are you trying to die?" The father scolded sternly and angrily.

Under excessive tension, terror, and panic, the mother subconsciously stuffed the clothes next to her tightly into the child's mouth to stop the crying. The child struggled in her hands. Not crying, it gradually seemed to fall asleep.

The bullets no longer whistled over the cave, and it was silent. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

"Oh dear, no... That's not good, quick... quick... light, the child... was suffocated by me..." Touching the child's cold body, the mother screamed.

Under the candlelight, the child's pale face still had tears on it, but it was motionless and no longer crying.

"It's over"--The despairing and sorrowful father couldn't help but cry bitterly.

The mother almost fainted. The cave was in chaos...

"Don't shout! Hey! Listen!" Xiaoliu shouted straightforwardly and blew it out...

A burst of scattered footsteps came from far to near, heading straight for the cave... The footsteps slowed down.

From the panting, scattered footsteps, and talking, it could be proved that this was a large group of Japanese soldiers who had just been defeated. They sat down to rest by the big willow tree beside the embankment.

The people in the cave were full of terror, but Xiaoliu's eyes were blazing with fire. He touched his weapon:

"Damn it! You ran into me! Humph!..." But he didn't pull the trigger after all. It was not because he cherished his own life, but because he thought that more than twenty poor innocent people would lose their lives because he pulled the trigger.

Under the faint moonlight, the Japanese soldiers' bayonets gleamed on the tips of their guns. Some were yelling strangely, and some were quietly talking in strange, incomprehensible words. But they were all disheveled.

The howling wind blew down raindrops as big as yellow soybeans, and they fell harder and harder. The Japanese soldiers all stopped jumping and yelling and fled to the dense branches and leaves of the big tree...

The people in the cave became even more terrified, Xiaoliu's eyes sprayed with more fire, his nerves were agitated with hot tension, and he trembled so much that he almost pulled the trigger...

But the fact told him that he really had to pull it, because, under his sharp gaze, a black shadow clearly discovered the cave and was telling everyone...

"Bang--bang..." When the Japanese soldiers were about to approach the cave to investigate, mad bullets flew out of the cave, and the black shadows fell down one by one...

"Gada gada gada..." A few seconds later, the bullets poured into the cave like locusts. The sound covered the sound of the wind and rain; Xiaoliu's gunshots; the screams of the cave; and even their own roars...

A few seconds later, all the sounds stopped, and only the howling storm remained. The Japanese soldiers cut Xiaoliu's body with bayonets, scolding him with extreme hatred, and insulting him as much as possible. But this was no longer relevant.

The storm continued, and water poured into the cave, mixing with fresh red blood, and all twenty-odd corpses floated up...

Quotations from Tagore
— Tian Rui

Only those who love can discipline people.

Our names are the light shining on the sea waves at night, and nothing remains after death.

If you put gold on the wings, then the bird can no longer soar in the sky.

Life receives its assets from the demands of the world, and receives its value from the demands of love. We misunderstand the world and say that it deceives us.

### The Love of a Petrel

— Jiang Shangqing

One late night, I braced my emaciated body in the storm and rushed back to the dormitory. Under the lamp, I saw that my body was soaked by the rain like a water duck.

An extraordinary memory knocked on the door of my heart, and my thoughts galloped to the vast distance: If it were a swallow perched on the seashore, what kind of thoughts would arise?

Such thoughts are indeed very naive, but such things are very common today. When a peacock or parrot who knows how to cherish its feathers is cowering in a cage, it is precisely a petrel returning in the storm on a late night.

As for me, do I still have to use such a beautiful story to explain myself? Living through life shows so many fragments; if there is any memory, it is also groping in the midst of the hateful eyes of the world, liked by a few, and hated by most. Each time when I walk the last steep mountain path in the wind and rain, I always tap the mountain stone with my cane and it echoes softly. He often mutters to himself when he flies back to his old nest in the wind and rain: "Another storm has passed."

Thus, when I lament the thinning hair at the temples of my friends, I see white hair on my own head in the mirror; if I have a good memory, this should be enough to alarm me. Now I live in this bustling and oppressive city, and passing one day seems like a year. Although my heart is stubborn, it is already trembling in the wind and rain of this world. This distant journey after another is coming at me. You say, will I shrink back and be conquered in the wind and rain of this world? I am used to seeing the petrels on the sea, and I will bravely fly to the distance, rush through this stormy night, and usher in the light, usher in a bright future.

Coming like jade, intestines rumbling, thousands of households crying to death! Not crying, begging to the gates of the rich, many fierce servants in front of the rich man's door. Finally teaching to steal from barren graves at night, ownerless corpses can fill people's bellies. Barren graves are exhausted, people are dead, and the millet officials will still come here tomorrow, coming here only to urge military millet, but seeing that every house is full of corpses, hungry people compete to eat their flesh again. The millet official also is startled by this! He whispers to the people in front; "The granary is full of rice and much mildew."

The weak girl has a delicate and thin body, worrying and comforting her father, washing clothes to earn a living, growing vegetables to serve in a plate, she should be happy that her child is growing up, but she is saddened by her hair gradually turning gray, the setting sun shines on the lonely tree, and the twilight enters her melancholy heart.

### "Gentleman's Friendship"

— Zhang Houqian

Ever since I heard the term "gentleman's friendship", I have approached him with peace of mind. Originally, can't there be pure friendship between men and women?

He has also repeatedly stated that the reason why he is willing to be with me is purely for my simplicity and enthusiasm. He wants to beautify me with his wisdom and knowledge, not like the pursuit of ordinary people. I have always believed this.

That day he said he would take me to the movies, so I dressed up early and waited. I wore a newly made lotus-colored cheongsam and matching earrings, feeling that I wasn't too tacky.

Who knew that after he sized me up, he threw down his hat and sat on the sofa to scold me, saying that girls should pay attention to inner beauty, and that it is not right to try to please people with their appearance. He also said: "Don't think that I know you because you are good-looking, let me tell you, I have never paid attention to your appearance."

I was so angry that I took off my earrings and burst into tears on the sofa.

Finally, he changed his attitude and coaxed me in an elder brother's tone: "Maybe my words were a little too intense, but my heart is always good. I am not your "boyfriend", why do I always have to condescend to you? Don't cry, crying will make your eyes swell and not "good-looking"..."

I asked him what he meant by "good-looking", and he had nothing to say.

I finally caught the movie, and I was still wearing my earrings.

A very honest girl has recently joined our music class, with long pigtails and thick lips. After talking to her a few times, I really like her simple attitude. I told him and asked him to come and see our class.

After seeing it, he had no expression.

"How about asking her to join our gentleman's agreement?"

He shook his head.

"How about introducing you?" He shook his head again.

"Isn't it good for the three of us to be friends?"

This time he spoke: "Why call her a "vegetable addition""?

I said we are also lovers, how do you explain that?

He patted me on the shoulder and said, "You don't understand."

I forced him to explain.

He smiled and said: "I don't understand either."

Although he is only five years older than me, he always treats me like a child, sometimes coaxing me, sometimes scolding me, and always holding me when crossing the road.

That day, on the way home from school, he put my left hand in his right arm and patted it from time to time with his left hand. I was immediately misunderstood by my classmates when they saw it, how could they understand that we are "gentleman's friends"? I wanted to pull my hand out, but he wouldn't let me, so I questioned him:

"Do you treat other friends like this?"

"You're the only pure friend I have."

"What about your sister?"

"I don't have a sister, only a cousin."

I know he used to be with his cousin. He used to walk like that.

"But it's not the same when I walk with my brother," I said.

"Not even your cousin?"

"Also no!" It wasn't until I firmly denied everything that he let go.

My home is not far from us. (End)

### An Inch of Land is an Inch of Blood 43

— Ye Jingfeng

This fellow was in the midst of roaring when he caught sight of a neat and orderly armed detachment, approximately ten pairs, passing by outside the guest room door and entering the adjacent room. Although a bamboo curtain hung on the guest room door, it was clearly visible from the inside. In less than two minutes, another orderly detachment appeared. In the hall outside the guest room door, they lined up in pairs and walked into the room on the lower side of the guest room. In Japanese parlance, this scene would probably be called a "demonstration."

After another three to five minutes, eight armed guards, marching in pairs, arrived outside the guest room door. They split to either side, four on each side, forming a wedge formation. Immediately following, an officer of the day on duty raised the bamboo curtain, entered the guest room, saluted Matsui and the others, and announced in a clear voice, "The Secretary-General of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and Mayor of Beiping, representing the Chairman of the Political Council, will receive you esteemed guests." Having said that, he immediately turned back to the door, standing rigidly at attention. Only then did someone lift the curtain high, and from the hall came a sound of footsteps. Four armed figures, carrying large platters of food and drink, entered the guest room, spread them out on the large dining table, and then withdrew. The officer of the day at the door immediately invited the guests to take their seats. At this moment, Mr. Qin Dechun, in civilian clothes and carrying a folding fan, entered the room.

It was now a little after two o'clock in the afternoon. From this time until nearly six o'clock, Chief Qin calmly dealt with the unreasonable and domineering nonsense of Matsui, Imai, and the others, refuting them completely. In the end, this group of rascals had no choice but to resort to the last resort, like hoodlums in Beiping who, unable to win by fighting or cursing, simply smash their own noses, revealing their true rogue nature, roaring and gesticulating wildly:

"We are not here to debate with you, but to notify your superior, on the orders of the highest authority, that within twenty-four hours, all troops under your command must withdraw from Beiping, Nanyuan, Xiyuan, Wanping, Changxindian, Mentougou, and the area east of the Yongding River. This request must be obeyed whether you accept it or not!" Having said that, they threw the documents they had brought onto the ground. "These documents were prepared long ago, ready to kidnap your military and political leaders and force them to sign. Since the first two steps of the conspiracy have failed and no one has signed, we have no choice but to throw them on the ground."

Chief Qin, still smiling gently and elegantly, replied: "Chinese troops are stationed on Chinese soil, not in the capital of your esteemed country. What reason do you have to demand our withdrawal?"

(The person who saw this matter most clearly from beginning to end was the officer of the day. That officer of the day was an incarnation of Mr. W, who made a temporary cameo to strengthen security. It is said that there was a joke on the spot: one of the attendants who came with Matsui, whether due to congenital deficiency or acquired imbalance, or having indulged in too much wine and cold drinks, was too embarrassed to leave his seat because the debate on the stage was quite heated, so he had to urinate hot urine in his pants, perhaps in too large a quantity, inevitably creating a large puddle.)

Less than half an hour after Matsui and his party left, while the sun was still hanging over the Western Hills, casting a lingering glow of sunset, the Japanese troops on all fronts suddenly opened fire. As I was receiving and sending telegrams from various locations at our station, I heard the buzzing of a formation of aircraft coming from the northeast, which surprised me somewhat, because according to secret reports, the Japanese were not expected to launch a major offensive until dawn on the 28th. I immediately telegraphed headquarters, but headquarters said "don't know." I then telegraphed the Beiping branch, which said it was a probing operation, a large formation of aircraft, and was for reconnaissance and exercise purposes.

### Dollar Jumps, People Cry

— Shao Fu

The American dollar has jumped greatly, breaking the four thousand yuan mark in the past two days. Judging by its trend, it seems that surpassing five thousand yuan is just a matter of time.

Those of us who worry every month upon receiving our new pay slips feel even more anxious upon hearing this news. The necessities of daily life will inevitably rise accordingly, so how are we to survive?

Some people are already analyzing the reasons for the dollar's soaring price. They say: first, the Central Bank has not settled foreign exchange for more than a week, foreign goods are piling up, and importers are panicking, so they are all rushing to the black market to scramble for spot goods; second, there are rumors that the official exchange rate of the legal tender against the US dollar will be adjusted again.

Others are saying: the above are all superficial reasons, the real reasons are (1) the situation is unstable, (2) the authorities have no solutions for the economy.

I am a layman when it comes to economic issues, but I believe that the above reasons, whether superficial or substantial, are not the real reasons. The real reason, in a nutshell, is speculation!

For example: first, the Central Bank is an institution that implements national financial policy. Since it can sell gold at any time to adjust market prices, there is no reason to deliberately not settle foreign exchange and allow the black market to soar; second, the rumors of adjusting the exchange rate have been solemnly denied by the authorities, and as Reuters reported on the 23rd: China is a signatory to the International Monetary Fund, and exchange rate adjustments are restricted and cannot be changed arbitrarily. "One-tenth" is the limit of devaluation, and a second adjustment cannot be made within six months; third, since the victory last year, the situation has been unstable for nearly a year, and it is not just these past two days; fourth, the economy has no solution, the overall situation is indeed bad. Superficially speaking, the price fluctuations in the past one or two months have not been drastic, and the government's issuance figures have not increased, so it cannot be said that the economic situation is particularly bad. Based on this, we really dare not believe that these reasons are driving the dollar's wild jump.

After thinking it over and over, it is still the speculators who are creating mysteries!

### American Marriage Problem Researcher's Opinion on Female Chastity

— Xu Ying, translated from "Reader's Digest" September issue

Dr. Paul Popenoe, director of the American Rosencranz Family Relations Institute and author of the famous book "Modern Marriage," has conducted detailed research on the issue of premarital chastity for young women. His conclusion is: "Chastity is still the pride of women and an important factor in successful marriage. We are by no means being pedantic in discussing the issue of chastity, because modern psychology proves that chastity is completely in line with normal human nature." So, let us hear what he has to say:

Those Who Disregard Chastity

There is a school of thought that argues that women do not need to preserve their chastity before marriage, for the following reasons:

(1) If men and women can have further intimacy during their first love, it can enhance their friendship and enable them to understand each other better.

(2) The release of sexual desire is very important for psychological health. Suppression is harmful.

(3) Premarital physical intimacy can help women choose a suitable husband, rather than being purely emotional and wasting their lives.

(4) Women need practical sex education before marriage in order to adapt to sexual life after marriage.

Research Results

However, scientific research has proven that the above reasons are unfounded and harmful.

(1) Experience tells us that premarital physical intimacy not only cannot enhance friendship, but may even destroy it. When men and women combine emotionally, it is only a partial expression of true love, and it lacks a sense of emotional security.

(2) The harm of suppressing sexual desire was discovered by psychologist Sigmund Freud. He believed that sexual desire must be released to avoid damage to personality. However, we must note that he also solemnly stated on the other hand that if the spirit and body are not united and only physiological release is emphasized, then the danger is even greater than the suppression of sexual desire.

The experiment of premarital physical intimacy can never achieve the union of spirit and body. The desires of men and women are very limited, and they are only greedy for temporary physiological release. The psychological doubts and fears at the time are very harmful to both parties.

(3) Countless case studies have proven that premarital physical intimacy cannot help a woman choose a more suitable husband. On the contrary, she often chooses a worse husband or cannot choose a suitable partner for life.

The fact is that statistics tell us that ordinary men still prefer to marry virgins. Or some so-called "progressive" men may deny this view. However, we can imitate "Arabian Nights" and conduct an experiment: put a pair of equally beautiful twin girls in front of a man, let him choose one to be his wife, and then tell him that the one standing on the left is a virgin, while the one on the right is not. We believe that nine out of ten men will choose the virgin as his wife.

The idea that a woman, after satisfying her physiological needs and eliminating emotional influences, can choose her husband more calmly is completely unrealistic. Most women do not feel very strong physiological impulses before marriage, unless they are used to a dissolute life or excessively stimulate themselves. However, once sexual experimentation begins, sexual impulses will become more intense. Sometimes it may even lead to bad consequences. Therefore, in this situation, premarital loss of virginity does not help them choose a partner.

Should Not Be Indulged

(4) As for the claim that the sexual experience gained before marriage can be a preparation for achieving a happy marriage in the future, this is also denied by the research institute's findings. Feelings of shame or guilt, fear of being discovered by others, fear of pregnancy, fear of sexually transmitted diseases, and suspicion of the other party—all these unhealthy psychological states will obviously hinder a woman from adapting to her sexual life after marriage.

More seriously, girls who "have had things happen" are most likely to develop a sense of inferiority, so she desperately looks for someone to "liberate" herself. The more she fails, the more embarrassed she becomes. By then, it is very likely to cause mental abnormalities.

Even if she finds a partner, she always feels that there are many difficulties and cannot adapt to married life, because her new partner is completely different from the previous man, with different backgrounds, emotions, and education. Therefore, it is not easy for both parties to adjust their marital relationship. This is also one of the reasons why men like to marry virgins.

The most unfortunate thing is that once a habit of experimentation is formed, it is not easy to change. Therefore, many case studies tell us that women who have already had sexual experience before marriage are most likely to commit crimes after marriage.

The research institute's findings finally found that couples who have not had any sexual experience before marriage are most likely to achieve happy results after marriage and can adapt to their marital life happily.

Modern women should carefully consider their "lifelong events." They will always recognize that premarital chastity is still worth preserving. Even if some people think that premarital sexual relations may solve some problems, it may also create many serious and difficult to solve new problems. In short, everything is up to them to decide. A moment of difference can lead to eternal regret. Even women in the atomic age need to "think thrice before acting" on this issue!

### Can You Sympathize?

— Yixing

Crossing the Garden Bridge on foot takes two minutes, by bicycle takes three minutes, and by tram takes five minutes.

When you call for the tram door to open, one word from an armed comrade, two words from a modern lady, three words from a Western-dressed class, and ten words from ordinary people are useless.

Watching a ball game at the city stadium, one-third enter by purchasing tickets, one-third enter by holding coupons, and the rest all enter by nodding their heads.

### Human Talk

— Mo Gao

If you are a human being, you are still a human being even naked; if you are not a human being, you are not a human being even if you wear silk and satin!

Humans have no boundaries or distinctions, but when they put on clothes, they have professions, grades, and differences between the rich and the poor.

Originally, people are good. However, for the sake of money and fame;

Some people sell their bodies,

Some people sell their consciences.

To see a person, you cannot look at their face.

To see a person, you cannot look at their clothing. The mistake in recognizing people is because you only look at their appearance.

The living are human beings, and the dead are also human beings. Only walking corpses are not human beings!

People can be divided into three types: one is to live oneself and hope that others also live; one is to live oneself and not hope that others live; and another is not to live oneself and tell others not to live either.

If you are human, you must live like a human being!

### A Respectable Figure

— Lu Shixiong

Mr. Shu He Fu, the former dean of affairs and professor at Shanghai University, withdrew to his home country immediately after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident. After returning to the United States, he missed his colleagues who had worked together for many years on campus. Being in a war zone, their treatment was very meager, and their lives must be very difficult. However, he himself was willing but unable to do enough. Later, after thinking about it, he felt that the house he lived in was too big, so he moved from three rooms to another two, and remitted the rent money saved each month to Shanghai, entrusting a friend to give it to his colleagues on campus. After a few months, he felt that the money he remitted was too little, so he moved from two rooms to one room. After a few months, he moved from a large room to a smaller one. He moved three times in this way in order to save more money to help his colleagues until there was no smaller place to move to, only enough to accommodate himself. He said: He felt more comfortable and happier being able to save money to help his friends in the war than living in a tall building!

Mr. Shu's son served in the U.S. Air Force stationed in China. Before Japan surrendered, he was ordered to fly to Shanghai to bomb. He had been instructed by his father that there were many friends of his father in Shanghai, so he was particularly careful when bombing, and made sure to aim at military targets before taking action. When he flew over Shanghai University in Yangshupu, he circled several times, reluctant to leave for a long time. He said: He wished he could land next to Shanghai University to see what was going on on campus, but it was still occupied by the Japanese army at that time, and it was impossible to do so. He wrote to his father about the situation he had scouted in the air to relieve his old man's concern about the Shanghai University campus.

After the news of the Japanese surrender spread, Mr. Shu raised many old suits and leather shoes in the United States, packed them in boxes, and waited until Sino-American aviation resumed at the beginning of last winter. He shipped the first batch of clothes and shoes to Shanghai and gave them to his colleagues in the university to replace.

Several months ago, President Ling received a letter from Mr. Shu from the United States. The letter said roughly that Shanghai was his hometown and Shanghai University was like his sweet home. He really wanted to come back and asked President Ling whether he could allow such an old and weak person to return to the school to resume his duties and enjoy his remaining years. Otherwise, he would definitely come to Shanghai on his own to meet his old friends once again to fulfill his long-cherished wish.

Mr. Shu had served in the school for a long time. Many of the buildings on the Shanghai University campus were built by him. He was very conscientious, loyal and upright in his work. In the past, when he was in office, he would refuse to pay for any inappropriate use of funds, so he had the humorous nickname of "Mr. Shu the Tiger." At the same time, he inevitably aroused the jealousy of others, so some people asked the accountant to audit his accounts twice, but they did not find any malpractices. So, they were not only helpless against him, but also admired him for being honest and upright. Now, seeing his great compassion for helping his former colleagues, it is even more admirable!

Shanghai Dynamics

### Useless Mounted Patrol

— Yuren

The Senate requested its abolition

The Senate has decided to abolish the police department's mounted patrol because the mounted patrol is an outdated police facility, which only wastes expenses and does not help in practice. Although Director Xuan sent a letter requesting "to maintain the status quo," most of the senators did not agree. From now on, "horse teams" will no longer be seen on the road.

The establishment of a mounted patrol in the Shanghai police agency began in the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, Shanghai's security agency was the "General Bureau of Police," which was divided into four districts and nineteen sub-districts, as well as mounted patrols, water patrols, and fire brigades. Since then, the establishment of this mounted patrol has been adopted.

The concession's constabulary in this city also had established the "mounted patrol" long ago. According to the annual report of the "Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession" in 1930, the mounted patrol had four large horses and thirty-nine small horses. The monthly feeding cost for each horse was about thirty yuan. The inspectors in the mounted patrol were Westerners, and the patrol chiefs and patrolmen were entirely Indians. Those Indian constables, tall and slender, with bushy hair, riding high on horseback, were indeed quite "majestic."

In 1933 and 1934, there was only one Westerner and one Indian in the mounted patrol team of the Public Concession. Two people were also counted as a "mounted patrol team," which was incomprehensible. From this, we can also see the work situation of the "mounted patrol."

The author spent a lot of time looking through the Shanghai police data, trying to find some "merits" of the mounted patrol, but I am sorry to say that, apart from occasionally showing off during large funerals and suppressing or dispersing crowds, other merits could not be found.

To be honest, the mounted patrol was superfluous even in the past. The Chinese are always accustomed to following old ways and let this outdated facility remain in modern cities. Now that it has been decided to abolish it, the mounted patrol can only "die in bed," and it lived for thirty-eight years.

### Sermon

— ww

Due to the "monk's petition" and the disagreement with lay people, I have a few more words to say. Freedom of religion is a general principle, and there is no distinction between each other; I also heard my elders talk about Buddhism when I was young, and my heart was moved by it. When I grew up, I saw the "Guanshiyin" movie, and my heart was greatly moved, so I wrote to Yuan Chen for instructions. The Master advised me to serve the society more, to be selfless, which is to believe in Buddhism. We can discuss it again on another day (probably referring to old age). Yuan Chen's words are exactly what I want. I admire his vision, recognize it clearly, and it is not common these days. The heart is the Buddha, why bother with smoke in form? Water and land rituals, incense candles, - how does it benefit my heart? I think there is a great need for reform. For example, Christianity is more progressive than the old religion. We need happiness, vitality, energy, and light, and I don't want to step into dark temples. I only enjoy listening to lectures, and I even advocate moving temples outside the city, so that you can calm down and then cultivate your heart.

### About Liang Shuming

— Gan Lai

Recently, there have been rumors that Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, will resign. Liang himself stated in person when he met with reporters in the capital on the 18th: "Resignation is planned, not sudden. When I accepted the position, I set a three-month term." Unexpectedly, Liang came to Shanghai on the third day and, after meeting with several leaders of the Democratic League, decided to "temporarily not resign." In this, we don't need to make wild guesses.

Liang is a famous scholar. His poems and prose are fluent and can be recited. Some even compare his writing to Liang Rengong's "Yinbingshi Wenji" for its briskness and vividness. He is the author of several books, including "An Outline of Indian Philosophy," "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophy," "Liang Shuming's Essays Before Thirty," and "Liang Shuming's Essays After Thirty." Among them, the two essays on literary history occupy a high value in academics.

Philosophy Professor

He is from Guilin, Guangxi. After graduating from the Zhili Public Law and Politics School, he served as secretary of the Ministry of Justice and professor of Indian philosophy at Peking University. During the Northern Expedition, he served as director of the secretarial office under the command of Li Jishen, the leader of the Gui faction. At that time, Liang was only twenty-five years old, which can be said to be a success in his youth. Soon, he was appointed as a member of the Guangzhou Political Branch of the Kuomintang and a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government. Later, he served as the principal of the First Middle School of Guangdong Province. The school was serious in teaching and well-managed, and it was the best middle school in the province.

When Liang was young, he had a short beard, wore outdated glasses, and wore simple clothes. He did not like to dress up. He looked like he was forty or fifty years old. The unrestrained attitude was just like the identity of a scholar.

Entertaining himself with poetry and prose Li's political failure, the dye also Shao light self-defeating, closed the door quietly, to poetry and prose. After that, he was hired by "Han Qingtian" (Fu Ju) to go to Shandong to establish and implement a model village plan. Because Han only had a reputation for being courteous to scholars, but his actual knowledge was shallow and his ideas were stubborn, it was not easy to get along between the guest and the host, and Liang felt very depressed.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Liang once served as the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Party and Government Committee. He was almost entirely responsible for all provincial government affairs and public training matters because the provincial chairman Shen Honglie was in charge of military affairs that day and could not take care of other matters.

Currently, Liang is fifty-four years old and is now a standing committee member and secretary-general of the Democratic League, becoming a mainstay of the political party. In the past, he succeeded in his youth, but now he should be called: "Old but vigorous."
