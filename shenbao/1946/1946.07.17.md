[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Our Newspaper, 16th] According to an urgent telegram from Yangzhou, the situation in northern Jiangsu, which has long been watched and cared for by all parties, has gradually moved from a dim and dull atmosphere to a bright and developing path. Since the Communist army in northern Jiangsu violated the government's ceasefire order and launched a large-scale offensive, the National Army has adopted a defensive posture in accordance with the ceasefire order, resulting in the danger of being defeated one by one in recent weeks. On the 13th of this month, Guangfu Bridge, the intersection of the Yangtai Highway, was cut off first. On the 15th, Taixian County and ports were greatly threatened. For a time, people were panicked and the situation was extremely serious. In order to boost morale and implement self-defense plans, the National Army stationed in Yangtai has now begun to attack. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the main force of the Communist army has been defeated, and Xuanjiabao has been captured in one fell swoop, and the Communist army has been completely cleared. The Communist army in Taixing is now fleeing to the southeast, and the National Army is expanding its victory and pursuing the attack. The Communist army of about 15,000 people in Zhangtaozhen, southeast of Taixian County, also attacked, but was repelled by the National Army. The situation in the ports is still stable, and the Kou Tai (Zhou) Highway is unimpeded. The Yangtai Highway has also been repaired by the National Army. It is reported that another National Army has detoured to force its way into Shaobo. The people in Yangzhou and Tai were extremely excited after hearing the news. The Jiangdu Daily and Jiangsu Provincial Daily specially issued extra editions.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Our Newspaper, 16th] More than 20,000 Communist troops moved from Lingtang Bridge to Tianchang on the morning of the 16th, with unclear intentions. In addition, more than two miles of the road from Chahe to Guangmu Bridge in Yiling Northeast were destroyed by the Communist army on the 15th, and the bridge was also demolished. The Communist army in Dingjiahu, north of Xiannv Temple, continuously attacked our stationed troops, seemingly as a probing nature.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Our Newspaper, 16th] Military News: Li Yimang, Chairman of the CCP's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government, recently decided on a new strategy: (1) Military operations will be defensive, only ordering militia to act as the front line to avoid sacrificing elite troops; (2) Abandon certain strongholds when necessary and implement a scorched earth policy.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Our Newspaper, 16th] According to a telephone call from Taixian County, the Communist army, with a crowd of 50,000, fiercely attacked Taixing for three days and nights. After the National Army's Regiment Commander Liu Guangyu led his troops to resist fiercely, killing more than 20,000 enemies, the Communist army finally failed and withdrew to Huangqiao at 5:00 AM on the 16th. There are no traces of the enemy in the suburbs of Taixing, and the National Army is following up and pursuing the attack.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 16th] The increasingly serious conflicts in northern Jiangsu are highly valued by people here. However, the government is still maintaining a silent attitude.

### The Communist Army Launches a General Offensive in Northern Jiangsu; The Government Protests

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Communist army launched a full-scale general offensive in northern Jiangsu, causing extreme anxiety among the people in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. The reporter specially visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense on this matter and asked about the situation and opinions. According to reports, at a time when peace negotiations are facing a serious stage, the Communist army suddenly mobilized 16 regiments of troops to launch a full-scale general offensive in northern Jiangsu, apparently wanting to disregard everything, seize the cities and towns on the north bank of the Yangtze River in one fell swoop, control the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, threaten Beijing and Shanghai, and create a favorable position relying on violence. Cities and towns such as Taixing, Xuanjiabao, and Zhangdian were captured by the Communist army on the 15th, and Haimen and Taixian County were besieged at the same time. A group of people attacked Shili Dian, north of Liuhe, while Yangzhou, Jiangyin Nantong, and Lai'an Jiashan in Anhui Province were all in urgent need of help. Xuzhou and Shandong were also in a state of emergency. Liuhe is only more than 30 kilometers away from the capital, Haimen is only 50 kilometers away from Shanghai, and Taixing is only 140 kilometers away from the capital. If these cities are lost, Beijing and Shanghai will be shaken, and Jiangnan will be in danger. This planned offensive by the Communist army completely violates the January 10th Agreement on the Cessation of Conflict this year. The spokesperson also said that northern Jiangsu is only across the river from the capital and Shanghai. From the effective date of the January 13th Cessation of Conflict Order to the end of July, the Communist army launched as many as five attacks on Liuhe, Yangzhou, Nantong, and Haimen. The attacks on the National Army in other places have never stopped. This time, the Communist Party has mobilized a large force to launch a full-scale general offensive in northern Jiangsu. The government has now lodged a serious protest with the Military Three-Person Group, Marshall, and CCP representative Zhou Enlai.

### Good Autumn Harvests Expected in Various Places; Grain Prices Generally Decline; Spokesperson for the Ministry of Food Speaks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] According to a statement from the spokesperson of the Ministry of Food: The price of grain throughout the country fluctuated in some areas due to the period between the end of the spring harvest and the beginning of the autumn harvest. Recently, due to the even rainfall in various places and the expectation of a good autumn harvest, there is a general trend of fatigue. According to recent observations of grain prices in major cities, rice prices in the southern provinces and the Beijing-Shanghai area are gradually smooth, with supply and demand corresponding. The price of medium-ripe rice in the market is still around 43,000 to 44,000 yuan per shi. However, in Shanghai, the price of rice once rose sharply due to the scarcity of sources and the imbalance between supply and demand. Later, due to the large number of Vietnamese rice and Sichuan-Jiangxi rice being transported in continuously, it was sold to citizens at a price of 46,000 yuan per shi, and the rising trend has slowed down. The two provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian are about to harvest drought rice, and the price of rice is expected to fall, mostly between 30,000 and 50,000. The provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei have also gradually declined recently. The decline in Sichuan Province is even more severe. The price of cooked rice in Chongqing has fallen to 12,000 yuan, and the price of cooked rice in Neijiang has fallen below 10,000 yuan. The price of rice in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces is still between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan, which is quite stable. As for the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan, the grain prices rose the highest due to the serious disaster situation in the past. Recently, the autumn rice is growing well and the early rice is gradually being harvested. The prices have been falling steadily. For example, Guangzhou and Guilin have fallen from a high price of 100,000 to 62,000 and 85,000 respectively. The decline in Changsha is even greater, now selling for 47,000 yuan. Soon, the new grain will be available, and the price of rice in various provinces is expected to fall generally. As for the price of wheat in the northern provinces, it is also generally tired and stable due to the good wheat harvest, especially in the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, which are even cheaper. Except for Xi'an and Lanzhou, which are slightly higher at 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, most of the others are between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan. The price of wheat in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces is slightly higher. For example, in Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, and Taiyuan, it has fallen to around 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

### UNRRA Spokesperson Says Suspension of Shipments is Short-Term, US Senators Criticize UNRRA Measures

[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press] A UNRRA spokesperson said: The quantity of various supplies continuing to be delivered to China has not decreased. It is believed that after receiving a report from Shanghai soon, the order to suspend the shipment of all materials to China except for emergency relief grain can be relaxed to some extent. According to unofficial sources in the State Department, the suspension of shipments to China will be short-term. According to reliable sources, UNRRA Acting Director-General Rooks has notified the US representative of the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) that he believes China's request to restore the supply of medicines and transportation rehabilitation equipment can be accepted, but the order can only be issued after receiving news from UNRRA officials in Shanghai that the goods to be shipped have been cleared. The UNRRA spokesperson believes that the suspension order may need to be gradually modified rather than completely canceled at once. The current policy is to cancel the ban on a certain item as soon as a report is received from Shanghai that there is a satisfactory environment for that particular type of item to be shipped to the interior, but no report on any such item has been received so far. There may be a report received today.

Senator Bridges said: "Clayton and others have created the fact that UNRRA has canceled relief supplies to China, but continues to supply countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia. To our knowledge, all of the aforementioned countries have misused relief supplies." Mr. Clayton said: "UNRRA's suspension of relief supplies to China is purely because China cannot provide the tools for unloading supplies or the transportation equipment for transporting supplies to the interior." The Appropriations Committee finally passed the $465 million UNRRA appropriation.

### Editorial: The Vatican Sends an Envoy to China

The Vatican has dispatched an envoy (Internuncio) to China, nominating Archbishop Antonio Riberi as the first Vatican envoy to China. This has been agreed upon by our government and announced successively in Rome and Nanjing. Although there is no confirmed information on when Envoy Riberi will arrive in China, now that the news has been released, the establishment of the Vatican Embassy in China should not be far off. Following the appointment of the first Cardinal of Chinese nationality and the establishment of the Catholic Church system in China, the Vatican's dispatch of an envoy to China is an unprecedented event in church history. Moreover, for our country, having a Vatican envoy stationed in the capital is also an unprecedented event in our diplomatic history.

Our country's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican coincided with the emergency in the international situation following the outbreak of the Pacific War. At that time, Japan dispatched Ken Harada, a counselor at its embassy in France, as its first envoy to the Vatican, who was later promoted to ambassador. For a time, the Vatican became the center of international diplomacy. The Axis powers such as Germany, Italy, and Japan had envoys stationed there, while the Allied powers such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Latin American countries also had envoys stationed at the Vatican. In order to take the diplomatic initiative and counter Japan's measures, our country began negotiations with the Vatican in the spring of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942) to establish diplomatic relations. An agreement was reached that our country would dispatch an envoy to the Vatican, while the Vatican would continue to have its Apostolic Delegate originally stationed in China perform his duties. Based on this resolution, our government appointed Xie Shoukang, the Chargé d'Affaires originally stationed in Switzerland, as our country's first envoy to the Vatican. The Apostolic Delegate to China considered that the center of Catholicism in China was in North China, which was occupied territory and faced greater difficulties, and disregarding the Japanese invaders' brutality and his personal safety, he continued to reside in Peiping (Beijing) to plan church affairs. In order to maintain contact with our government, Bishop Yu Weishan of Chongqing was appointed as Deputy Delegate, and an office of the Apostolic Delegation was established in the wartime capital. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Archbishop Cai Ning, the Apostolic Delegate to China, flew from Peiping to Chongqing to meet with the Chairman and the heads of our government. He reported on the years of struggle against the Japanese invaders to protect the church's work, and then flew to Shanghai, Hankou, Hong Kong, and other places to convene episcopal conferences, listen to reports, and plan for the future development of church affairs.

Some people, noting that our country had sent an envoy to the Vatican, while the Vatican's envoy in China was an Apostolic Delegate without diplomatic status, believed that our country's diplomatic relations with the Vatican were a one-way street. Thus, they advocated requiring the government to order our envoy to the Vatican to negotiate with the Vatican to send an envoy to China as soon as possible to replace the existing Apostolic Delegate. The Vatican's maintenance of relations with various countries and dispatch of envoys was originally carefully considered. The United Kingdom has a state religion and sends an envoy to the Vatican, but the Vatican sends an Apostolic Delegate without diplomatic status to the United Kingdom. US President Truman sent a personal representative with ambassadorial status to the Vatican, but the Vatican sent an Apostolic Delegate without diplomatic status to the United States. The dispatch of a Vatican envoy currently only exists for the Netherlands. Otherwise, the Vatican either sends an Ambassador (Noncio) or an Apostolic Delegate. Now that our government has agreed to the dispatch of a Vatican envoy, in addition to the Netherlands, there is one more Vatican envoy among the envoys dispatched by the Vatican.

A month ago, Cardinal Tien Gengsin returned from Rome and, passing through Shanghai, said that Pope Pius XII intended to send an ambassador to China to promote relations between China and the Vatican. Our Chairman has always attached great importance to the relationship between our country and the Vatican and also intended to upgrade our country's envoy to the Vatican to an ambassador. However, this plan has not been realized at this time. Some people believe that, according to international practice, a Vatican ambassador should be the leader of the diplomatic corps in the host country, which may be inconvenient in our country's situation. However, they do not know that it is precisely because our country's situation is different from purely Catholic countries such as France, Italy, and Latin American countries, and also different from the United Kingdom and the United States, that if a Vatican ambassador were stationed in our country and served as the leader of the diplomatic corps, it would be enough to show the broadness of our national spirit and set an example for the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. Moreover, the Vatican has no political ambitions, and having the Vatican ambassador serve as the leader of the diplomatic corps would be sufficient to show its transcendent status. Furthermore, since our country established a church system, our country has had a normal church organization and is no longer a missionary area. It is especially appropriate to respect its system and exchange ambassadors. According to international practice, an envoy represents the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but only an ambassador can represent the head of state.

The Vatican is a small place, without a single soldier. From a materialistic point of view, its position in international relations is insignificant. However, the Vatican, because it is the residence of the Pope and the repository of the world's highest moral authority, is important. The post-war reconstruction of the world, with its myriad threads, requires the reconstruction of the moral order as the top priority. For this reason, envoys from various countries gather at the Vatican, making it an important center of international diplomacy. Our country, as a country without a state religion, sends an ambassador to be stationed there, which is sufficient to show our emphasis on moral authority and promote the glorious traditions left by our ancestors. Now that our country has established normal diplomatic relations with the Vatican and exchanged envoys, we deeply hope that there will be further development in the near future, upgrading the envoy to an ambassador, to be in line with the utmost intention of our Chairman and the Pope to promote relations between our country and the Vatican.

Now that the Vatican envoy has been announced and will soon come to China to take office, the Apostolic Delegation to China, established since the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), will be abolished. Archbishop Cai Ning, the current Apostolic Delegate to China, who has been in China for 13 years, will soon return home. Since the establishment of the Apostolic Delegation to China, it has been more than 20 years. Through the efforts of Archbishops Costantini and Cai Ning, the relationship between the Catholic Church in China and our country and the Vatican has finally reached its current state. As we recall their meritorious service, we express our sincere gratitude and admiration to both Archbishops Costantini and Cai Ning. The new Vatican envoy to China, Archbishop Antonio Riberi, is knowledgeable, talented, and capable. We firmly believe that he will be able to build on the achievements of Archbishops Costantini and Cai Ning and make many contributions to promoting relations between our country and the Vatican. We only express our welcome here.

### England Must Foster Cultural Ties to Win Chinese Respect

British Newspaper Writes on Eden's Speech

[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The Yorkshire Post, commenting on Eden's recent speech in London emphasizing the need to strengthen Sino-British relations, said: This is merely a public statement of the belief that all thoughtful people have long held. During the war, many Chinese were hurt because the British paid little attention to China. It continued: Today, China is beset by civil war and has not yet presented a pleasing picture. It also stated: "It is noteworthy that people who have personally experienced such disasters have not lost faith in China's future." In some parts of China, where there is no communist disturbance, construction work is progressing step by step, especially the restoration of railway transportation. The newspaper added: "If only the Yangtze River basin and South China can restore peace and prosperity, the impact on the world's recovery will be inestimable." The newspaper solemnly declared: If we want to win the respect of the Chinese, we must promote not only trade, but also cultural relations and understanding.

### Byrnes Accuses Soviet Policy of Hindering Germany's Economic Recovery; Peace Should Not Be Based on Revenge; The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting Achieves Little

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Secretary of State Byrnes gave a radio broadcast today reporting on the proceedings of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Paris. Byrnes blamed the Soviet Union for the lack of progress on the German and Austrian issues at the meeting, but also acknowledged that the prospects for negotiations on the peace treaties for the five defeated European nations were now clearer, as the foreign ministers' efforts to reach an agreement had borne fruit and the European Peace Conference would be convened in Paris on the 29th of this month. Byrnes said that the peace treaties agreed upon at the meeting were not the ultimate in human wisdom, but were indeed the greatest wisdom that mankind could achieve under the four principles recognized by the United Nations. Ninety days after the ratification of these treaties, the occupying forces must withdraw, leaving only a portion of the troops to protect the lines of communication. At that time, the people of the occupied countries will be able to live and breathe in an atmosphere of freedom, and we will embark on the road to restoring peace. Regarding the issues of Germany and Austria, I believe that the Soviet Union finds it difficult to understand us, just as we find it difficult to understand the Soviet Union. The US proposal for Germany's disarmament, which was supported by the UK and France, was opposed solely by the Soviet Union and was therefore shelved, which is truly regrettable. I believe that the four-power administration of Germany has not been entirely successful. Therefore, the US military representative will be instructed this week to cooperate with the UK, France, and the Soviet Union, or any one of them, on important administrative issues such as finance, transportation, communications, trade, and industry. If we do not achieve economic cooperation between the occupied zones, we will be responsible for violating the Potsdam Agreement. As for the Austrian issue, the Soviet Union insists that the refugee problem within the country and the elimination of the National Socialist Party's influence must be resolved before a peace treaty can be concluded with the country, which is also inappropriate. In short, we do not believe that peace should be based on revenge, but on righteousness, selflessness, and magnanimity. If we act with kindness and compassion, we can turn enemies into friends. We must trust in peace and pray for God's mercy to grant peace to the world.

### UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie to Visit Moscow; Scheduled to Depart from Dunjin on the 22nd of this Month

### Stop Soviet Imperialism; Not Hesitating to Use the Atomic Bomb; The Warning of the Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, William Averell Harriman, in his recent book "The Realities of American Foreign Policy", criticized the Soviet Union. The gist is that the only totalitarian imperialism that threatens the world today is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is to establish a communist dictatorship system around the world. If the United States does not take immediate steps to stop its growth, it must succumb to it. We are seen by the world as a giant with feet of clay, and the people who look to us for leadership have begun to doubt whether we are intelligent enough to plan the work of freedom and peace. But the fact is that the United States possesses the overwhelming power to promote world peace. We must first oppose the idea of attacking the Soviet Union. We are stronger than the Soviet Union today because we rely on the atomic bomb and a large air force and can destroy it. But if we launch a pre-emptive war against the Soviet Union because we know that the Soviet government intends to wage war against us in the future, this action will lower our moral standards and make us indistinguishable from the communists. However, this does not mean that we should hesitate to use the atomic bomb to stop the new crimes of Soviet imperialism, because executing assassins is not an immoral act.

### In the Pacific and Middle East; England Lowers a "Velvet Curtain"; Soviet Newspaper Attacks British Policy

[United Press, Moscow, 15th] Pravda today published an article by Ichakov, stating that while the British side accuses the Soviet Union of lowering a "velvet curtain" in Eastern Europe, England itself is hanging a "velvet curtain" in the Pacific and the Middle East. This curtain isolates the East Indies from the outside world, and strange news often leaks from behind the curtain, indicating that it is difficult to cover the world's eyes and ears with one hand. The war ended a year ago, and the announcement has been made five months ago, yet the war in the East Indies continues day after day. Behind the same velvet curtain, the British delegation went to India with a plan to deal with the independence issue, but the most important issue, namely the withdrawal of British troops from India, was shelved.

### Soviet Espionage Case; Canada Releases Investigation Report; Soviet Espionage Sub-Agencies Also Exist in the UK and US

[United Press, Ottawa, 16th] The Canadian official report on the Soviet espionage case stated: Soviet spies have carried samples of Uranium-235 to the Soviet Union. Many other highly secret military inventions have also been leaked as a result. Moscow is now seeking information on the post-war defense of the US, UK, and Canada. Soviet espionage work also has sub-agencies in the US and the UK, so Canada should consider whether to inform the "appropriate authorities in the UK and the US" of the matters it has uncovered.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Attorney General Clark announced last night that the US government has begun negotiations with the Canadian government on various points in the report. The Department of Justice is fully aware of the espionage situation and is prepared to take immediate action when necessary.

[United Press, Ottawa, 15th] The Canadian Investigation Committee has released its third report on the Soviet espionage case. The final report, which is 200,000 words long, was released today. It stated: Soviet spies attempted to spy on the most important political secret information of the governments of the US, UK, and Canada within Canada. Moscow apparently has "several parallel secret agencies" in Canada, which may still be ongoing. The Soviet espionage network has also spread to the US and the UK, and even has traces in Europe. This report was submitted to the House of Commons by Prime Minister King. In addition to the original fourteen spies, nine more were identified, and several shocking secrets were revealed. The main points of the report are as follows: "There is an agency somewhere that specializes in obtaining counterfeit Canadian passports and other identification documents for espionage activities within Canada and other countries. "The espionage agency in certain countries in Europe is directed and funded by Colonel Zabotin (formerly the director of the military intelligence agency in Canada, who was later recalled to the Soviet Union) and his assistants. "The Soviet secret political police have a powerful agency in Canada. "In addition, several parallel secret agencies in Canada are directly directed by the Soviet Embassy. They may still exist. "Soviet spies have also stolen extremely important political secret information, thereby spying on the various policies of the governments of the US, UK, and Canada. "There is also considerable evidence of the existence of a naval espionage agency. "There is also a secret political agency, headed by Gorsalov, the second secretary of the Soviet Embassy, which specializes in directing communist activities.

### General He Yingqin Expresses Impressions of Japan Before Departing for the US

[Gaejoosa, Nanjing, 16th] Before departing for the US from here yesterday, General He Yingqin issued a statement saying: The best impression I received in Tokyo was MacArthur's political contribution to Japan, which was even greater than his contribution as a soldier. I firmly believe that under MacArthur's leadership, Japan will be able to smoothly move towards the path of democracy. Japan suffered direct war damage for only one year, while China suffered eight years of war damage, and most cities were destroyed. The Chinese people have suffered greatly, which the Japanese cannot imagine. Japanese leaders only thought about the development of the military and economic economy and ignored political reforms, which is the reason for indulging in the abuse of force and also the reason for trapping Japan in today's plight. However, if the Japanese people abandon their policy of aggression in the future and turn their efforts in the war to peace and construction, they will surely make a great contribution to world peace. China's foreign policy is to be kind and neighborly and to convince people with virtue. I hope that Japan will become a democratic country and work together for the happiness of all mankind in the world.

### Atomic Bomb Underwater Explosion Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow

Number of Experimental Animal Deaths Released

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 16th Broadcast: General Blandy, on the flagship outside Bikini Atoll, officially announced that another eighty animals on the forward-stationed ship used for atomic bomb testing have died. Since the July 1st test, the number of animals that died at the time and those that have gradually died since then has reached 537. (Note: There are a total of 3,519 sheep, pigs, mice, and other animals used for the experiment.) Because all animals are affected by the radiation during the atomic bomb explosion, there may be continued deaths in the next few weeks.

[United Press, Atomic Bomb Test Memorial Ship USS McKinley, 15th] The second atomic bomb will be detonated underwater in the Bikini Lagoon by triggering it with radio waves from the lead ship. The ship is scheduled to test a dummy bomb first on the 19th. A flash bomb full of gunpowder will be remotely detonated by radio.

### Yugoslav Partisan Leader Sentenced to Death: Execution Set for Today; Appeal on Eight Major Charges Rejected

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 16th: It has been broadcast that former Yugoslav Partisan Commander Mihailović has been sentenced to death and is scheduled to be executed by firing squad tomorrow. His appeal has been rejected.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] General Mihailović, former Yugoslav Partisan leader, was recently sentenced to death by the pro-Soviet government. Former Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, Fotić, citing Mihailović's assistance in rescuing American airmen during the war, for which he is highly regarded in the United States, today requested President Truman to intervene and prevent Mihailović's execution.

[Associated Press, Belgrade, 15th] Mihailović was sentenced to death by a military tribunal yesterday. He has been granted eight and a half hours to petition the Yugoslav parliament for clemency. Unconfirmed reports suggest that Mihailović and ten of his subordinates will be secretly executed.

Enumeration of Charges

[Reuters, Belgrade, 15th] Mihailović is charged with eight major offenses: (1) Colluding with the aggressors and engaging in terrorist activities to suppress the Yugoslav people's resistance movement. (2) Joining traitors to oppose the liberation movement. (3) Engaging in military and political conspiracy with Germany. (4) Using the slogan of protecting the Slavic nation as a pretext to undermine Slavic unity. (5) Opposing communism and instigating civil war. (6) Obeying the orders of the exiled Yugoslav government, which stated that "fighting the enemy is not yet the time," thereby weakening Yugoslavia's fighting capacity. (7) Inciting ethnic hatred. (8) Colluding with Gestapo personnel to organize terrorist groups after the country's liberation. Following the sentencing, the defendants' lawyers, representing the families of the accused, petitioned the Presidium of the National Assembly for amnesty.

Tito's Remarks

[Reuters, London, 15th] A telegram from Belgrade states that Marshal Tito, in a speech given today in Montenegro, said that the verdict against Mihailović and others is equivalent to a verdict against international reactionaries. Although anti-Yugoslav elements are unwilling to accept the Four Foreign Ministers' decision regarding the port of Trieste, they do not intend to engage in adventurous actions, but will continue to strive through legal channels to persuade Western nations to change their attitude towards Yugoslavia. This trial shows that while reactionary forces are connected, democratic forces are also connected. Mihailović colluded with all reactionary forces, but the reactionaries ultimately failed. Now, the reactionaries are attempting to seize Istria, Trieste, and the Julian March, which belong to our country, as revenge.

### German War's End; Plan to Bomb New York: Design and Manufacture of Super Bombers; Full Development of Rocket Weapons

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] The U.S. Army Air Forces announced today that scientists under Hitler had designed and manufactured super bombers to bomb New York. This was one of 136 secret weapons that Germany was striving to complete or improve at the end of the war. According to Putt, Deputy Director of the Technical Intelligence Division of the Air Materiel Command, these bombers were expected to ascend to 114 miles above the ground, but they were not completed. The Germans hoped to use one hundred of these aircraft to destroy any city on Earth with several days of bombing. Germany designed a long-range flying-wing rocket intended to carry small rockets, launching from a specific location at a speed of 5,800 miles per hour. This weapon had a range of approximately 3,000 miles, sufficient to cross the Atlantic. Other weapons included rockets to destroy the United Nations' air forces and rockets utilizing all existing remote control and ignition methods, such as radio, radar, sound, infrared, and magnetic force. All methods of propulsion using rockets were fully developed. Germany made significant progress with jet engines, which could generate 4,400 pounds of thrust and achieve a speed of 500 miles per hour. Fritz X radio-controlled bombs, capable of penetrating armor, were deployed against United Nations ships at Salerno. In January 1945, the largest-scale manufacturer produced butterfly-shaped rockets, controlled by radio, to counter bombing raids. The greatest development in explosives by the Nazis was the V-2 rocket, with a range of 250 miles and a maximum speed of 3,500 miles per hour. A total of 10,000 of these were manufactured. During the three months that these bombs were used, they accounted for one-tenth of the British casualties from aerial bombing. The Greater London area was struck by 2,351 V-2 rockets, killing 5,476 people and destroying 23,000 buildings.

### Islamic Leader's Grand Gesture: Weighing Himself with Diamonds

[Reuters, Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika, 15th] Aga Khan, the spiritual leader of 25 million Ismaili Muslims, is expected to arrive here at the end of the month. He will be weighed with diamonds on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of his ascension to the leadership. He also held a similar ceremony on his birthday this spring.

### Full Text of Byrnes's Speech

[United States Information Service, Washington, 15th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a national broadcast this evening, reporting to the nation on the results of the recent Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. The full text of the speech is as follows:

After every major war, the victorious nations feel the difficulty and disappointment of the work of peacemaking. Even in the case of the United States after the War of Independence, it took five years for the thirteen states, in disagreement over domestic issues, to formulate a constitution that would protect lasting peace within the country. The creation of world peace, and the reconciliation of differing views, all require greater tolerance and understanding. To seek the most perfect decision, accept it, and then implement it; the creation of world peace requires this kind of intent and ability. Just as war fuels disaster, we can also strengthen peace with peace. Therefore, two months after the victory in Europe last summer, President Truman and I decided at Potsdam to establish a Council of Foreign Ministers to begin the work of peacemaking, and we wholeheartedly hoped to achieve peace in all regions. Judging from the situation at the time, concluding a peace treaty with Germany would obviously take a considerable amount of time. Since Germany did not have a government that was involved in the matter, we also had no agreement to stipulate a date for the establishment of a deceptive German government. It was also extremely clear that we should conclude peace treaties with Italy and other Axis satellite states. Since Italy and other countries still had governments, we immediately began work in this area.

Paris Peace Conference

Over the past ten months, the world has been well aware of the arduous work we have done to eliminate differences of opinion among the major powers, draft peace treaties, and prepare for the convening of a peace conference. This work has now come to a successful conclusion, and it has been decided that the peace conference will be convened in Paris on July 29th. In addition to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the United States, sixteen other states that participated in the war against the Axis powers in Europe will also participate in the conference. Although the Council of Foreign Ministers has made suggestions regarding the organization and agenda of the peace conference, the conference can still decide its own organization and procedures. In the past, there were suggestions that meetings of subcommittees should be kept secret, but after our opposition, this suggestion was abandoned. I have stated that, as far as the United States is concerned, we believe that the proceedings of the conference and its committees should be made as public as possible. The task of the peace conference is only to make recommendations; the members of the Council of Foreign Ministers are responsible for drafting the final draft of the peace treaties and considering the recommendations of the conference, and they should not reject any of them without good reason. After the Council of Foreign Ministers has considered the recommendations of the conference and approved the final draft of the peace treaties, the treaties will be signed by representatives before the conference adjourns.

Draft Peace Treaties

The draft peace treaties approved by the various countries are not the best fruit of human wisdom, but they are indeed the best result that human wisdom can achieve with the unanimous agreement of the four major powers. The draft peace treaties will show that the attitude of the various countries towards restoring the world in a world filled with war clouds not only represents the opinions of the President and the Secretary of State, but also represents the opinions of Senators Connally and Vandenberg, who are rich in diplomatic experience and have a deep understanding of the work of concluding peace treaties and creating peace.

Greatest Dispute

The greatest dispute lies in the Italian treaty, and the biggest problem involved in that treaty is the fate of the port of Trieste and the territory along the western coast of the Istrian peninsula. The American representative, with the support of the British and French representatives, strongly advocated that the port of Trieste and its surrounding territory should remain with Italy, while the Slavic hinterland should belong to Yugoslavia. The Soviet Union strongly argued that Trieste and the surrounding territory should not be cut off from its direct hinterland. Although the Soviet Union acknowledged that several cities and towns along the coast did belong to the United States, it strongly argued that the Istrian peninsula should be regarded as a single territory, and since it is considered as a single territory, its sovereignty should naturally belong to Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia also supported this view. The Soviet Union further argued that greater consideration should be given to the demands of Yugoslavia than to the demands of Italy, because Italy was formerly an Axis partner and should be held responsible for fighting against the Allied nations and the loss of thousands of Allied lives; on the other hand, Yugoslavia had always fought alongside the Allied nations and had suffered the oppression of Italy. Since the Soviet Union and we were both unwilling to compromise, someone proposed that this issue be submitted to the peace conference, but the Soviet Union also disagreed with this point. Therefore, we were in a dilemma that was more serious than most people could imagine.

Separate Treaties

We could have concluded a treaty with Italy separately, ignoring Trieste, but the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav government, as well as several other governments, were unwilling to accept such a treaty. If we were to conclude a treaty separately, the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav government would inevitably demand that Italy also conclude a treaty with them separately, ceding Trieste to Yugoslavia. If Italy were to refuse, it is not difficult to foresee the difficulties that would arise from this. Even if no one offered a treaty to Italy, a disarmed Italy could only resist the Yugoslav army as long as our army was protecting Trieste. In an effort to break this deadlock, France informally proposed that the port of Trieste and its surrounding territory be separated from Italy, but not ceded to Yugoslavia, and that its security and integrity be guaranteed internationally. At first, no one made such a suggestion, but after careful study, this suggestion seemed reasonable and could serve as a basis for mutual agreement. Before Italy joined World War I, it had suggested that the Trieste region should become an autonomous state. My delegation insisted that the region should be protected by the United Nations, and not, as suggested by the Soviet Union, by the Italian and Yugoslav governments, nor, as suggested by France, by the four Allied powers.

Sovereignty of Trieste

This suggestion was finally agreed upon, with Gorizia and Monfalcone in the north being assigned to Italy, and the remaining area west of the mutually agreed ethnic line, including the Free Territory of Trieste. Indeed, sovereignty within the Free Territory of Trieste belongs to Italy, while sovereignty outside the territory belongs to the Slavs, but neither the Italians nor the Slavs within the territory are placed under foreign rule. They have domestic rule, the people will elect their own parliament, and the parliament will elect officials to enforce the laws. They will be supervised by the United Nations Security Council and a fair trustee appointed by the Security Council. The prosperity and welfare of the port of Trieste are not only related to Italy, but also to Yugoslavia and the countries of Central Europe. The port of Trieste is the natural outlet for Central Europe to the Mediterranean Sea, and the only railway leading to the port of Trieste passes through Yugoslavia and is managed by Yugoslavia. Representatives of the Yugoslav government strongly argued that if the port of Trieste were to be handed over to Italy, they would inevitably transfer their traffic to Hum, or other Yugoslav ports. Due to the animosity between the two nationalities in the region, United Nations control can be said to be the best way to avoid armed conflict and ease tensions. If the region were to join either Italy or Yugoslavia, its political and economic relations with the other country would inevitably suffer. Its industry may not be able to absorb the necessary capital, and workers may find it difficult to find work. If the Free Territory of Trieste can maintain friendly relations with its neighboring countries, this small territory may enjoy greater prosperity and become a greater source of solutions to problems for its neighboring countries, which would be more beneficial than joining either Italy or Yugoslavia. I firmly believe that if the parties concerned can work together, the solution to the Trieste issue will be extremely fair and have a chance of being realized. Unless they cooperate, the problem will not be solved.

Italian Colonies

Regarding the issue of the disposal of Italian colonies, the various parties have not yet reached a final decision. We should remember that the Soviet Union originally had a demand to be entrusted with the trusteeship of Tripoli, and the Soviet Union said that it hoped to obtain a merchant shipping base in the Mediterranean region. France suggested that the various colonies be entrusted to Italy for trusteeship, and the Soviet Union also expressed its willingness to accept France's suggestion in April. The United Kingdom has expressed its support for our suggestion that Italian colonies be entrusted to the United Nations for trusteeship, except for the issue of Cyrenaica, which is still under consideration. In view of the difficulties of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and the danger that the colonial issue would hinder the resolution of other issues, I suggested that the discussion of this issue be postponed. It was finally decided that the final disposal of the colonies should be decided by the four major powers after considering the wishes and welfare of the people of the various colonies, and taking into account the interests of other countries and world peace and security. If the four major powers can reach an agreement on the disposal of the colonies within one year after the peace treaties come into effect, they should handle the matter in accordance with the opinions on the disposal of colonial issues put forward by the United Nations General Assembly. The four major powers also agreed to send envoys to the various colonies to investigate the wishes of the local people. Until this issue is resolved, the Italian colonies will continue to be administered by the existing British military authorities. I am very satisfied with this matter, because the final decision on the colonial issue does not require the unanimous agreement of the four major powers. Even if the four major powers fail to reach an agreement, the United Nations can come forward to decide. The Soviet Union finally withdrew its opposition to the occupation of the Dodecanese Islands.

Reparations Issue

The issue of reparations is even more difficult. The Soviet Union insisted that it should receive at least $100 million in reparations from Italy. In addition, according to the armistice agreements signed by the Allied nations with Hungary, Romania, and Finland, the above-mentioned countries should each pay $300 million in reparations to the Soviet Union. For this reason, the Soviet Union's policy on reparations from Italy is also difficult to be lenient. On the other hand, we deeply feel that Italy has given us all kinds of assistance in the months before the end of the war, so we do not want it to bear the heavy burden of reparations, which would hinder its economic recovery. We had previously agreed that Italy could use its wartime factories within its borders, and the assets of Italian nationals in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, to offset the reparations. However, the Soviet Union insisted that Italy's reparations should be paid in currency or in products manufactured by Italian factories and shipyards in the future. Although we had no choice but to agree that the Soviet Union should receive reparations of $100 million, we made a request, believing that even if Italy paid the reparations with its products, the Soviet Union should find ways to transport these products to avoid hindering Italy's economic recovery. At the same time, we also requested that the Soviet Union grant Italy a grace period to start paying these reparations two years later. In order to avoid Italy borrowing money from us to buy raw materials to manufacture the goods that the Soviet Union would receive as reparations, we also requested that the Soviet Union supply Italy with the necessary manufacturing raw materials. There are still some issues in the peace treaties with Italy and other countries that have not been finally agreed upon. The Soviet delegation insisted that the Soviet Union would not agree to convene a peace conference until the four major powers had reached an agreement on their views on all basic issues. We believe that the Soviet Union does not consider this issue to be a basic issue and will accept the decision to convene a peace conference. (To be continued)

### Jiaxing Kidnapping Case Cracked at Zhaofeng Park: Hostage Shakes Hands, Police Swarm Out; Bandit Leader "One-Eyed Dragon" Had Killed Two People

[Our Own Dispatch] On June 9th, six bandits armed with four firearms went to the home of Lu Yangyun, a wealthy businessman in Jiaxing, and kidnapped his sixteen-year-old son, Lu Zhichao. They claimed to be from the New Fourth Army and stated that they were borrowing 50 million yuan due to insufficient military funds. Before leaving, they threatened that if the case were reported to the police, they would not only kill the hostage but also shoot the entire family. This case was cracked several days ago. It is reported that after kidnapping the hostage, the bandits took a boat from Zhao Family Village and traveled by water to Shanghai via Hengjing and Huangdu, hiding him somewhere in Zhoujiaqiao. Lu Yangyun reported the case to the Jiaxing County Government on the 10th. On the 13th, he received a letter asking him to negotiate at Zhuangjiajing, Jiwangmiao, on the 19th. Lu went there himself, but without results. On the 22nd, Lu entrusted Ni Binru and Tang Jiatao to return to the original location to negotiate, agreeing on a ransom of 12.5 million yuan, with an initial payment of 1 million yuan on the spot. On the 30th, another 3 million yuan was paid. On July 5th, they met in Shanghai and paid another 5.5 million yuan. On the appointed date, they paid another 4 million yuan at the Huierkang Cafe, and the hostage was released. However, the bandits refused to accept the 4 million yuan because it included a bank promissory note dated July 14th, insisting on cash. They then agreed to exchange the note for cash at the entrance of Zhaofeng Park between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM on July 10th. Afterwards, Lu reported the incident to the Changning Branch Bureau. On that day, Lu Zhichao went to the park entrance and saw the bandits waiting. He immediately stepped forward and pretended to shake hands. At that moment, Section Chief Shi and Officer Xu of the police bureau, who had been deployed all around, seized the opportunity to swarm out and arrest the bandits, taking them back to the bureau for interrogation. The bandit confessed that his name was Yao Wenhua, also known as Xiao Yao, nicknamed "One-Eyed Dragon." He also confessed that his accomplice, Wang Xin, was hiding at No. 8 Xinmin Inn, Wusong Road, Hongkou. Officers went to arrest him but failed to find him. He was later captured that night at the entrance of the Jiaxing Grand Theater. Yao Wenhua also confessed that during the enemy puppet period, he served as an intelligence officer for the enemy constabulary. He had disagreements with his colleague Li Wenbin and later killed Li. At that time, Li's family reported the incident to the Beixinjing puppet police station. The puppet police chief, Zhang Yiren, arrested Yao Wenhua and sent him to the puppet court, which sentenced him to eight months in prison. Yao was released on September 14th last year after serving his full sentence. Unexpectedly, at the Shenyanggen teahouse in Zhoujiaqiao, Yao encountered Zhang Yiren again. He lured Zhang to the wasteland near Gaojia Temple at the intersection of Huobili Road and Yulin Road, and together with two accomplices, killed Zhang, inflicting six fatal knife wounds. They then threw the body into a small ditch. There are still four bandits at large, and they are currently being pursued.

### Debate on Assault and Battery Case Concludes; Sentencing Set for the 20th of This Month

On June 23rd, various organizations in this city held an anti-internal disorder parade, during which incidents of assault and battery occurred at locations such as Fuxing Park. After the District Court Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution, the District Court initially heard the case on the morning of the 9th of this month. Yesterday morning, the court convened again, and the debate concluded, with sentencing scheduled for the 20th of this month. It is said that before the hearing, the majority of those in the audience were male and female students. The entire trial lasted three and a half hours, adjourning at 1:00 PM. The defendants in this case, Xu Damao, Zhu Jiangsheng (in custody), Diao Minzhi, and Ruan Guangyu (released on bail), hired lawyers Zhu Shaowen, Yu Zuoliang, and Sha Qianli to defend them. The plaintiffs, Yu Qingrong, He Xuechun, Zhang Yong, Qiu Shengqing, and Yu Zhenhua, were represented by lawyers Duanmu Kai, E Sen, Yu Fuding, Lu Jiayi, and Zhao Zuwei, who entered the court successively. However, the four witnesses summoned this time, Lin Handa, Gu Qinliang, Huang Wanqing, and Li Zhaolin, did not appear in court. Presiding Judge Wu Shaochang continued to preside over the trial. The first to testify was the victim, Yu Zhenhua, who stated: "I study at Zhiye Middle School. At 12:45 PM on June 13th, I was distributing leaflets at the Risheng Lou and Yile Tian Lou, which led to me being dragged downstairs and beaten." Yu Jinrong stated: "I am a student at Zhonghua Vocational School. I was beaten while distributing leaflets on Henan Road and Nanjing Road, and my hands were tied behind my back and I was dragged onto a truck. Xu, Zhu, and others were all present, including a worker wearing a 'Patrol' armband." Zhang Yong stated: "At the time, I was reading in the library on the second floor of the YMCA when I was suddenly attacked by a group of people wielding wooden sticks. I was labeled a 'secret agent' and dragged onto a car, where the words 'Special Agent' were written on me with paint. I was then taken to Fuxing Park via Ma Lang Road. As for the weapons used by Xu and others, the police station can be consulted for verification." Finally, he testified in court that the perpetrators and guards were undoubtedly the defendants Xu and Zhu. At this point, Judge Wu questioned the defendant Xu Damao, who denied the assault and other actions, stating, "I never saw anyone distributing leaflets." Zhu Jiangsheng refuted the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the plaintiffs and witnesses during the previous hearing. Diao Minzhi strongly argued that he was not on the car as a guard and performed a demonstration in court, carrying a lead bucket and cloth bag, cunningly claiming that because he was carrying the tools for pasting slogans, he could not have hit anyone. Ruan Guangyu testified: "I was with the parade, from Gezhi Middle School to the North Railway Station. At 11:00 AM, while passing by the YMCA and other places, I did not see any fighting." Subsequently, the defendant's lawyers temporarily presented eight male and female witnesses, Zhang Peixin, Tang Guifen, Sun Jin, Xu Huiqing, Gu Liang, Liu A’gen, Liang Run, and Zhu Qingyan, who all unanimously stated: "Our parade team was walking on Avenue Edward VII when we heard something had happened ahead. We waited patiently and did not witness any fighting." After the questioning, Prosecutor Fang Zheng stood up and argued: "The defendants have already confessed to the police, and the facts are clear. They should be convicted according to the law for the crimes of joint injury and obstruction of freedom." Subsequently, the lawyers on both sides engaged in a fierce verbal battle, attacking each other's weaknesses. The defendant's lawyers argued that the defendants were motivated by patriotism and were acting to demand peace, and had not harmed anyone or obstructed their freedom. The trucks they prepared were for rescue purposes. The plaintiff's lawyers responded: "If it was a patriotic act, why did they beat people who were acting for the same goal? And why was a mimeograph machine placed inside the truck? Could a mimeograph machine be used for rescue? This shows that the defendant's actions were premeditated." Finally, the plaintiff's lawyers brought up the attached civil lawsuit, in which the victim Zhang Yong requested compensation for clothing and medical expenses totaling 498,000 yuan, Yu Jinrong requested 378,000 yuan, and He Xuechun requested 105,000 yuan. Judge Wu questioned the defendants again, who all replied that this was not the case and that they were not liable for compensation. At this point, after everyone in the court, including the plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses, signed and stamped their names, they were returned to custody or released on bail to await the verdict.

### Major General Liu Yaohan Receives US Medal for the Second Time

[Reported by this newspaper] US Army Lieutenant General Killen, stationed in China, presented Major General Liu Yaohan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Logistics Command of our Army Headquarters, with the Bronze Star Medal of Freedom at his office in the Datong Building at 2:00 PM yesterday. The award recognized his outstanding contributions and cooperative spirit to the US Army Logistics Command during his tenure from July 25th to August 14th, 1945. His excellent English was also praised by US military authorities.

Those who attended the award ceremony included US Army Headquarters Deputy Commander Colonel Rogers, Executive Director Colonel Tao, Intelligence Director Colonel Weton, Administrative Director Colonel Dunerci, and Chief Engineer Colonel Collinsk. The citation was read by US Army Adjutant Captain Link.

General Liu is from Hebei and is 39 years old. After graduating from middle school, he went to the United States to study at Carleton College. In 1944, he graduated from the US Army University. After returning to China, he served as a liaison officer for General Stilwell and participated in the Guilin-Liuzhou Conference as a member of the chairman’s delegation. He later served with General Stilwell in Burma. Subsequently, he served as the chairman’s personal liaison officer to General Wedemeyer. General Liu is currently stationed in Shanghai, representing the Logistics Commander in charge of military transportation. This is the second time Mr. Liu has received a medal from the United States. The first time was last year in Chongqing, when he and Minister Bai Chongxi, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, and former Vice Minister of Military Administration Lin Weiwu were simultaneously awarded medals by General Wedemeyer. The award medal was signed by the late President Roosevelt, because General Liu and others received their awards in 1944, which were signed and issued by President Roosevelt.

### Grain Loan Case Resumes Hearing Today; Chief Prosecutor Reported to Beijing Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] The Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters has been conducting intense joint court hearings on the grain loan case for several days. Yesterday, the person interrogated was Ren Xingyai. The hearing began at 9:00 AM and lasted until 5:00 PM.

### Sheng Laosan, Shao Shijun, Qian Da Kui, etc. Lead Luxurious Lives, Acted Arrogantly, Confiscated Property of Traitors Is Shockingly Valuable, All Utensils Used Are Either Gold or Silver, Diamond Rings Are the Most Numerous Among the Ornaments

In the inventory of the confiscated property of traitors and collaborators, we can see the extravagant lives of ordinary traitors during the period of the Japanese occupation, who abused the people and acted tyrannically. For example, the utensils used in the homes of traitors such as Sheng Laosan, Shao Shijun, and Qian Da Kui were either gold or silver, showing an unparalleled extravagance. According to what this reporter learned, among the Shanghai traitors, those who had the most houses and real estate confiscated were Gu Huanzhang, Sheng Youxuan (i.e., Sheng Laosan), Wu Yong'an, Shao Shijun, and others. Those who had the most gold, silver, and diamond jewelry were Sheng Youxuan, Li Shiqun, Shao Shijun, Qian Da Kui, and others. Among these traitors, Sheng's property was the most extensive. The inventory of his confiscated property was 128 pages thick (each page lists 15 items of property), including 6 pages of real estate, 2 pages of promissory notes, 1 page of stocks, 21 pages of gold and silver jewelry, 1 page of gold and silver, 30 pages of furniture, and 67 pages of other items (including clothing and other miscellaneous items), which is twice as much as Shao's property. Among the jewelry, there was a platinum brooch inlaid with a nine-pointed star-shaped large diamond, with a 28-carat diamond in the center and about 160 small diamonds weighing about 15 carats around it, which is estimated to be worth more than 60 million yuan at the lowest estimate. In addition, there was a 24-carat large diamond "Longevity" brooch, as well as 20-carat and 18-carat or larger diamond rings, and more than 30 diamond rings ranging from 2 carats to less than 10 carats. The spittoons, smoking sets, ashtrays, small pedestals, and birdcages used by Sheng were all made of gold, and there were 47 large gold bars. The real estate confiscated included: two houses on Avenue Albert, a Western-style house on Avenue du Grand-Occident, six houses on Avenue Joffre, six houses on Rue Pere Huc, two houses at No. 1 and 2 Shengde Lane on Route Tenant de la Tour, four houses in Lane 1699 on Avenue Haig, 23 houses on Rue Lagrenée, a Western-style house on Route Cohen, a house at No. 118 Rue Pere Huc, 12 houses on Route Virmont, a garden villa in Hangzhou, six residences in Suzhou (one with 71 rooms and the other with 52 rooms), and 13 properties in Changzhou. Shao Shijun's real estate also occupied 6 pages in his confiscated property inventory, most of which were in Shanghai. The entire inventory consisted of 47 pages, including 6 pages of real estate, 6 pages of promissory notes, 3 pages of stocks, 18 pages of jewelry, 1 page of gold and silver, 5 pages of furniture, and 8 pages of other items. The most valuable items in Shao's jewelry were a diamond necklace inlaid with nine large diamonds totaling 37 carats and 77 small diamonds, and a diamond bracelet weighing 18 carats, as well as a single large diamond weighing 10 carats, and 20 to 30 diamond rings and diamond buttons weighing less than 10 carats. There were also seven [units missing] and two gold blocks. Because Shao was in [place missing], it is believed that all of his gold and silver jewelry are not included in this number. Qian Da Kui's confiscated property inventory consisted of 20 pages, with jewelry occupying 6 pages, gold and silver occupying 1 page, and real estate including a Western-style house at No. 1015 Rue du Lieutenant Petiot, a house bordering Avenue Joffre, five mu of land on Hongqiao Road, and a house in Taicang County. The opium smoking sets, teacups, and spittoons used by Qian were all made of gold, and diamond rings were also the most numerous among the ornaments. The largest was a single diamond ring weighing 54 carats, and there were 46 large gold bars, two gold bars weighing five taels each, and 20 small gold bars. In summary, the total value of the confiscated property of these three traitors is shocking. Therefore, it is generally estimated that the value of the confiscated property in Shanghai (the previous estimate released by the Xingju was about 50 billion yuan) is more than 50 billion yuan.

### Hartung Inheritance Dispute Expected to Be Resolved Soon; George Recognized as the Main Heir

[Reported by this newspaper] According to this reporter's inquiries from relevant sources, the inheritance dispute of the Jewish businessman Hartung in this city, which has been in litigation for many years, will soon be resolved peacefully. Hartung's heirs will donate three plots of land, respectively, to the National Government, the Municipal Government, and as a fund for charitable causes. The value of this land is estimated at more than 10 million yuan, based on the currency value in 1941. Hartung's inheritance has been subject to complex disputes since the death of Hartung's wife, Luo Jialing, in October 1941. Initially, there was the so-called dual case of the 1931 will and the 1937 will. The former designated Hartung's adopted son, George, as the main heir, while the latter designated Hartung's comprador, Ji Juemi, and Luo Jialing's adopted sons and daughters as the main heirs. The two sides sued each other for a long time without a resolution. In 1942, twelve Jews who claimed to be relatives of Hartung, including Esra Sassoon Hartung, filed a lawsuit requesting to take over the management of Hartung's estate, further complicating the case. At that time, Shanghai was under the control of the enemy and puppets. According to newspaper reports, the puppet court designated Jin Dingxun and two others as estate administrators. Subsequently, the puppet Ministry of Justice Administration ordered the revocation, as the case was purely a private rights dispute. The lawsuit between the two sides ended without a resolution. After the victory, through mediation by various parties, Luo Jialing's adopted children have agreed to recognize George as the main heir. Currently, only Ji Juemi has not fully agreed, but according to relevant parties, there should be no further major complications. As for the twelve people who claimed to be relatives of Hartung, they had already sued Luo Jialing and lost the lawsuit when Hartung passed away, so they should know that it is difficult to succeed this time.

### Conversation with Li Fusun, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Li Fusun, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, returned from the United States at the end of April. Our reporter attempted to interview him once but was unable to have a thorough discussion. Yesterday, we visited him again, and the reporter asked several questions. Mr. Li was kind enough to answer them in person. Excerpts are as follows:

(Question) Recently, you were appointed by the government as a member of the Supreme Economic Council. Can we hear your suggestions on various national economic measures?

(Answer) After my appointment, the Supreme Economic Council has not yet met, so I have no concrete opinions. I privately believe that our country's agriculture, industry, and commerce have always lagged behind. The eight years of the War of Resistance have caused enormous losses in manpower and material resources. From now on, all national manpower and material resources should be fully used for productive construction. I sincerely hope that a peaceful era will truly unfold so that various plans can be put into practice. Construction is a major undertaking and requires a large amount of capital. We should be diligent, thrifty, and endure hardship, accumulate capital, and guide it well. At the same time, we should attract foreign investment and cooperate with it. What we should pay attention to is the "guidance" and "attraction" of capital. The direction of capital movement is nothing more than safety and profit. Therefore, the safety and profit conditions of investment must be vigorously promoted so that domestic and foreign capital will easily converge. As for the manpower required for construction, we have plenty of labor. The start of various construction projects can solve the employment problem for the people. We still feel that we lack technical personnel. We should recruit foreign talent to assist in the work and provide training.

(Question) What are your opinions on the boundary between state-owned and private enterprises?

(Answer) Regarding this point, Chairman Chiang mentioned the principles and gave specific examples in his broadcast speech on the eve of the 34th National Day, roughly saying, "...There should be a clear division between the types of state-owned and private enterprises... All enterprises that are national in scope, monopolistic, and difficult for the people to undertake, such as the steel industry, national railways, and large-scale hydropower plants, should be state-owned. Other economic enterprises can be widely operated by the people... Our national construction plan should aim at the welfare of the people. The people's economic freedom should be protected by the overall national plan. This is the meaning of our ancient teaching, 'storing wealth among the people.'" Also, at the 33rd International Business Conference in New York at the Repair Workers' Union, I was also one of the representatives. I received a telegram from the government regarding the main points of the private enterprise system and commercial policies, roughly saying, "...Enterprises that cannot be entrusted to individuals or are monopolistic should be operated by the state. All enterprises that can be entrusted to individuals or are more suitable for private operation than state operation should be operated by individuals and encouraged by the state and protected by law." It also said: "Our country's enterprises, whether state-owned or private, may accept foreign investment." After returning to the country, I went to Beijing last month to meet with Chairman Chiang and received further instructions. The original policy and boundaries will not change and must be implemented soon. Premier Song of the Executive Yuan has also repeatedly stated that the temporary state operation of certain enterprises after the war is a matter of expediency and will eventually be transferred to private operation. The principles stated by the government are very clear, and the boundaries are also quite clear. However, we hope that they will be implemented as soon as possible so that entrepreneurs can operate with peace of mind.

(Question) What are your opinions on the reform of our country's monetary system?

(Answer) The stability of the monetary system is paramount and is closely related to other economic items. The main part of the stabilization work is currently being carried out by the Central Bank and is proving to be quite effective. Recently, many people believe that the exchange rate of the national currency is too high. This is not unreasonable. However, when the government set the current exchange rate, it really wanted to avoid stimulating prices and causing losses to the people. As long as the country is stable, transportation is restored, production increases, and exports are smooth, the value of the currency will naturally be stable. I deeply feel that the Central Bank attaches great importance to the credit of the national currency and will not easily change the current exchange rate. Speculators in gold and foreign currencies may inevitably incur losses.

(Question) What are your opinions on the domestic financial situation after the war?

(Answer) In terms of finance, what I have observed since returning to the country differs from before the war in two main ways: first, the number of banks has increased significantly; second, prudent operation is not yet widespread. In my humble opinion, the main source of operating funds for banks is deposits. Now, in terms of the "quality" of bank deposits, they are actually much lower than before the war, and almost all are demand deposits, which are highly volatile. Under these circumstances, bank lending operations must be particularly cautious. If banks make imprudent loans, or even engage in covert speculation, such as buying and selling gold and US dollars, or even directly operating in the buying and selling of goods, it will not only endanger themselves but also have a great impact on the entire financial market and the entire society. Although banks are profit-seeking organizations, they should have social goals and a national concept in addition to profit-making. Therefore, prudence is a proactive approach and not a passive attitude. I hope that all colleagues will not take chances, adhere to the right track, and not forget their social goals and national concepts, so that we can jointly seek long-term development.

(Question) You just said that prudent operation is not yet widespread. What are some examples?

(Answer) Many banks are doing acceptances and bill discounts, but some of them are inevitably related to bills that are not based on genuine trade, and some have not obtained reliable collateral. The acceptance or discount procedures are not in line with government regulations, and some even pay no attention to the background and credit of the bill debtors. In European and American countries, accepted bills are the best and most important credit instrument, and bill discounting is the most important lending business for banks. In our country's business and financial circles, we should carefully examine the truth and earnestly promote them. It would be a great mistake to abuse this good name. In addition, the so-called "guarantee" of post-dated checks is particularly dangerous and clearly contradicts legal regulations.

(Question) Recently, at the end of June, the money market was extremely tight. What is the reason?

(Answer) The tightness of the money market at the end of June was due to three reasons: first, industries and businesses had a large amount of taxes due, which were summarized and paid to the Central Bank at the end of the month, so the deposits of various banks and firms suddenly flowed into the Central Bank, which collected the taxes. Second, the silver and money industries had a mid-year settlement holiday, which lasted three days including Sunday. Customers who received cash usually deposited it in banks and firms, but temporarily did not deposit it because of the holiday. Third, the illiquidity of the Great Asia Bank caused market anxiety. Under normal circumstances, banks and firms with prudent operations maintain a relatively high level of daily payment reserves, so their payment ability is still sufficient, and they can temporarily lend to their colleagues to provide some assistance.

(Question) It is said that the Central Bank has refused to grant loan requests from banks and firms. From the perspective of the Central Bank's position and mission, how should this be viewed?

(Answer) As far as I know, the current policy adopted by the Central Bank focuses on tightening. In my humble opinion, this policy is very appropriate today when various speculative trends have not yet subsided and the business of banks and firms has not yet become universally stable. In fact, the Central Bank is certainly willing to make adjustments for prudent colleagues when necessary. Also, when various colleagues undertake important and legitimate lending but their own funds are insufficient, such as the spring fertilizer loans for the silver and money industries this year, the Central Bank has also provided appropriate assistance.

(Question) It is said that the Shanghai Silver and Money Industries Joint Reserve Association is about to be established, which will be very helpful to various banks and firms in the future. It is also said that the Shanghai Clearing House will also be reorganized. What are the measures?

(Answer) When the "January 28th" First Shanghai Incident began in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], the Shanghai financial industry was the first to be affected, and its payment ability suddenly became short. Banks urgently convened a meeting to deal with the situation and jointly initiated the establishment of the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Association, which centralized assets to make adjustments. The money industry also established a joint reserve treasury, which stabilized the market. Later, during the turmoil in the money industry in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], during the Second Shanghai Incident in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], and during the run on deposits in the silver and money industries in the summer of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], it made great contributions to colleagues and society. In July of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], the Ministry of Finance formulated the principles for silver and money industries to establish joint reserve associations in Chongqing and ordered them to be promoted in various places. Many of the measures adopted the original Shanghai system. After Shanghai was recovered, the city's finances were being reorganized. The banking industry reserve association and the money industry reserve treasury, due to the original business during the war, such as interbank deposits and interbank lending, etc., either have other appropriate affiliations or are temporarily not needed, so the banking industry reserve association is still suspended, and the money industry reserve treasury has been closed. This spring, the silver and money industries associations, in view of the unstable situation of the financial industry in the city and the lack of a mutual assistance center among colleagues, proposed to rebuild the joint reserve system. After returning to the country, I consulted with the Central Bank authorities, who all agreed that the joint reserve system could be an arm of the Central Bank and agreed with it. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has approved the establishment, and a covenant will be signed soon. In the future, while colleagues have this center for gathering strength, they must also strive for prudence, consolidate the foundation, and have a consistent pace so that collective security can be ensured. We must know that after the new reserve association is established, interbank lending will only be carried out for temporary adjustments when truly necessary, and it cannot be used to supply operating funds to general colleagues. Therefore, colleagues should not have excessive expectations for the new reserve association. As for the Clearing House, the silver and money industries and foreign banks used to operate separately. Last year, when Shanghai was liberated, the silver and money industries followed the instructions of the Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance and organized a unified Clearing House. At that time, in order to quickly complete the unification work, the Central Bank appointed members of the Clearing House to manage the affairs of the Clearing House with the approval of the Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance. When I returned to the country, I happened to be at the time when the silver and money industries associations had completed their re-election. The Central Bank authorities, in accordance with the practice of allied countries, believed that in large cities with a large number of negotiable instruments, a non-profit organization nature Clearing House should be established by the financial industry itself to specialize in the clearing of negotiable instruments. Therefore, they instructed the silver and money industries to elect executive members of the Clearing House themselves and be supervised by the Central Bank to comply with the system. The two associations decided to do so. Therefore, the reorganization of the Clearing House is actually only the re-election of the members of the Clearing House.

(Question) What are your opinions on the current municipal administration of this city?

(Answer) After Mayor Wu took office, he governed with a decisive style, such as the adjustment of city tax revenue, which is sufficient to reduce the burden on citizens, and the control of the rice market and the handling of labor-management issues, which are all difficult matters and the measures are very wise. In addition, he has made every effort to rectify social morality, which has refreshed the views of both Chinese and foreigners and has been widely praised. Secretary-General He is a virtuous and upright scholar who, with his experience in serving in the Municipal Council before the war and as Deputy Mayor after the victory, is Mayor Wu's right-hand man. It can be said that they complement each other. What I personally hope is that all citizens of the city should understand that every citizen has a responsibility for the improvement of the city's administration and should assist in promoting public facilities so that the city's construction work will become more smooth.

### US Sailor Steals and Sells Cigarettes; Aukin, Laihai, Given Suspended Sentence

[Report from Our Newspaper] Aukin Laihai, a 22-year-old American, was a sailor on the American merchant ship "　Tuo La," which was docked at the Kai 　Wharf in Nikkei Harbor. At 3:30 a.m. on June 30th of this year, Aukin Laihai stole eighty-two cartons of cigarettes from the ship. The captain, Fulai Duo, discovered it and reported it to the police, who arrested him and sent him to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye tried the case in the Third Criminal Court. Sun Zhaozhang, a lawyer selected by the US Consulate, was appointed to defend him in court. According to his confession, his monthly salary was only US$145. He had an elderly mother at home, and US$100 had to be sent home for living expenses. The remaining US$45 was not enough to use in Shanghai, so he was confused for a while and stole the cigarettes. He had already sold eighteen cartons for US$25, and the rest had been recovered. Subsequently, Lawyer Kong stated that the defendant was young and had a family burden, had never committed a crime before, and had expressed remorse today. He should be given a lenient sentence. Judge Ye then announced in court that "the defendant is guilty of theft and is sentenced to three months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence." After Lawyer Kong explained the meaning of the suspended sentence to the defendant, the defendant indicated his acceptance of the sentence in court and was released on bail. It is reported that the defendant has been detained for two weeks.

### Landing Craft Test Run on the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, our reporter met with Mr. Hailishi, a British shipowner who successfully test-ran a landing craft on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River for the first time, and inquired about the test run. According to him, he has test-run landing craft on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River many times. During the first small-water test run, the water level in Yichang was only four feet one inch deep. During the second medium-water test run, the water depth was fourteen feet. During the third high-water test run, the water depth was more than twenty feet. During the fourth high-water test run, the water depth was more than forty feet. All the test runs were successful. As a result of the test runs, a water depth of between twenty and thirty feet is the most suitable. He said that the rudder of this landing craft should be modified to be larger. Although some ships have been modified to be larger, they are still not very suitable. It is said that there will be a total of fifteen landing craft sailing on the Yangtze River in the future. Among them, China Merchants Bureau has ten ships and Minsheng Company has five ships. He has now been hired by the Executive Yuan as a teacher to train landing craft drivers. He is currently actively training a large number of crew members, who will be assigned to various ships after six months. According to Haili, he has been working for Minsheng Company for fifteen years. During the War of Resistance, he always sailed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. He is especially familiar with piloting on the Yangtze River.

### Incompetent Doctors Cause a Lot of Harm; Authorities Intend to Ban Them

The reporter then visited Zhang Wei, director of the Health Bureau. Director Zhang expressed deep pain and hatred for incompetent doctors who endanger people's lives and said that the Health Bureau had long paid attention to this and had already drafted concrete measures to ban them. However, because they are currently concentrating all their efforts on epidemic prevention, they have not yet launched it. When the reporter immediately asked about the content of the measures, Director Zhang smiled and did not answer, only saying that they would be seen in action within one or two weeks.

### The Ministry of Education Decides to Establish a National Educational Broadcasting Station in the Capital, Broadcasting Can Begin in January Next Year

[Our Newspaper's Special Report from Nanjing] The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to promoting educational television. The original plan was to complete the establishment of the National Educational Broadcasting Station (the name has not been completely finalized, it may be named the National China Educational Broadcasting Station) in the first half of the 35th year, and start broadcasting in the second half of the year. However, the return to the capital and post-war recovery slowed progress, and this plan was delayed. It was not until July of this year that the plan was completely finalized, and preparations for the establishment were immediately carried out. Broadcasting equipment has been purchased from the United States, a site has been selected in the capital, and design and management are underway. It is estimated that broadcasting can begin in January next year. If this station is established, not only will social education be greatly promoted, but school education will also receive good guidance. At designated times, the whole country can use radios to enter the "Air University" and attend classes everywhere. Furthermore, the promulgation and revision of educational laws and regulations, and the slow delivery of official documents from distant places, can be quickly and promptly known through this broadcast. This educational broadcasting station has the following three missions: (1) to implement air broadcasting-style education at all levels of schools; (2) to promote social education through broadcasting; (3) to facilitate the dissemination of new educational laws and regulations. National educational institutions and schools, as well as provincial and municipal education departments, must have adequate radio reception equipment and must designate specialists to be responsible for the transmission of radio education news and regulations.

### Hu Shi Concerns Himself with the Preservation of Ancient Books at the Central Library

Central Library - Millions of Volumes of Ancient Books

[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] The National Central Library of China is currently running out of space in its storage rooms, resulting in millions of volumes of ancient books that cannot be accommodated.

### Chaoyang College's Ping and Yu Campuses: Ju Zheng and Xia Qin Concurrently Serve as Presidents

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] Chaoyang College has a history of more than 30 years in Beiping. During the War of Resistance against Japan, it moved to Sichuan and continued classes at Xinglongchang in Ba County. After the victory, universities that had moved inland returned to their original locations one after another. Chaoyang College was no exception, causing high school graduates in Sichuan Province to feel the pain of having nowhere to go to college. Moreover, with the implementation of constitutional government imminent, the country needs legal talents. Based on the above two points, the establishment of Chaoyang College in Chongqing was founded. According to the Ministry's order, independent colleges cannot establish branch colleges. Therefore, the old and new campuses can only be named Beiping and Chongqing, respectively, but in fact, they are still sister schools, both of which are headed by Ju Zheng and Xia Qin as president and vice president. When the Yu campus opened in the spring of this year, due to limited funds, only evening classes in the law department were established, with one upper and one lower class, totaling more than 200 people. Recently, the college's board of directors has been working hard to raise funds, add school equipment, and receive hundreds of thousands of books from the Beiping Chaoyang Library in Xinglongchang, actively preparing for day classes.

Who should be taught for advanced studies, who should be taught life skills, and who should be given moral education should all be determined according to individual circumstances in order to achieve the effectiveness of education. Third, we should cultivate production skills. At the beginning of the recovery period, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, we must strive for the development of production. Cultivating production skills should be the most urgent task at present. Fourth, the education of talent must be in line with the national reconstruction policy. We must not be overly ambitious or stick to old conventions. The current problem lies in how to rebuild the country, so the direction of education must immediately follow the road of national reconstruction and advance in order to cooperate with the national policy. I am a native of Zhejiang, but I have been away from Zhejiang for a long time. I still need to observe the actual situation in the province. In the future, I will follow the instructions of the central government, refer to the local conditions, and take measures step by step. It is also heard that only Zhong Weishi came with Mr. Li on this trip to Hangzhou to take office." (Butterfly)

Commercial News: Export Packing Loans at 6% Annual Interest with 70% Loan Value; Can Be Re-Mortgaged with Letters of Credit

[Our Report] Recently, in order to encourage exports, the Central Bank initiated export packing loans to facilitate funding for exporters. In order to understand the loan measures, this reporter visited an authorized foreign exchange bank yesterday. They informed me that these loans started to be processed successively from mid-June. There are generally two types: (1) Exporters holding letters of credit can apply for loans from designated banks with their letters of credit. The designated bank will lend 70% of the amount stated on the letter of credit, calculated at an annual interest rate of 6%. Once the exporter's goods have been shipped, they can submit the bill of lading, insurance policy, and all supporting documents listed on the letter of credit to the designated bank that provided the original loan to complete the repayment procedure. After receiving these documents, the designated bank will calculate the interest from the date of the loan to the date of submission of the documents, plus one month of interest, as it is estimated that it will take about one month from the time the exporter's documents are sent to the United States until the payment is received in the United States. The designated bank undertaking this loan may re-mortgage to the Central Bank with the exporter's letter of credit at an annual interest rate of 4%. The term of the loan is three months. (2) Exporters who do not hold letters of credit apply for loans, which are handled at the discretion of each designated bank. The decision to grant the loan or not is generally based on the amount of foreign exchange held by the bank itself and the exporter's creditworthiness. The term of the loan is six months. However, the Central Bank does not accept re-mortgages. It is understood that for exporters holding letters of credit, their goods have already been shipped to Shanghai. Conversely, their goods are likely to be held up in other ports. For both types of export loans, if the exporter stops shipping the goods abroad or fails to sell the foreign exchange to the designated bank that provided the original loan on time, the loan will be calculated at the prevailing domestic interest rate. At the same time, all designated banks will be notified to refuse to deal with the exporter in the future. The designated bank also expressed the hope that the Central Bank would allow designated banks to handle re-mortgages for the second type of export loan. They also hoped that if the exporter were to default, the Central Bank would compensate for the foreign exchange losses incurred by the designated bank. This reporter then inquired with relevant parties about this matter, who stated that if the Central Bank were to compensate for this loss, it would be equivalent to opening a loophole in foreign exchange resources, which would be difficult to implement.

### The Money Market is Loose; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rise in a Straight Line

Chinese stocks continued to be actively bought yesterday. Liquidity was excessively abundant. With nowhere else to turn, silver firms and pawnshops continued to pour into the stock market. From the morning opening, various stocks gradually rose, with very few setbacks along the way. Small stocks were even more arrogant. High prices were seen throughout the morning. Near the closing, there was a slight consolidation. Smaller and less active stocks such as Match, Sino-French, Underwear, and New Asia continued to be absorbed by investors. Old established stocks also showed activity. As a result, compared to the previous close, Wing On, Shanghai Silk, and Meyer rose by more than 50%, while Jingfu, New Light, and Qinxing rose by more than 150%. Smaller, less active stocks also rose by 50% to 100%. Old established stocks made slight gains.

Foreign stocks were suddenly absorbed by Sichuan individual investors. The buying intention was unusually strong. At the same time, there were rumors in the market that foreign stocks would be auctioned in Hong Kong. The upward trend was therefore stronger. Ewo Silk rose from 8,800 yuan in the morning to 9,500 yuan. Hong Kong & Shanghai Hotels rose gradually from 9,100 yuan to 10,500 yuan before leveling off slightly. As a result, stocks rose in order of the degree of rumor-driven buying, with Ye Guang rising by slightly less than 100%, and the rest rising sharply by around 150%.

### The Gold and Currency Markets are Quiet

Gold continued its previous path, meandering within a short distance in an extremely mediocre situation. The opening was stable. After opening, it rose from 1,942,000 following the US dollar to 1,955,000. However, the upward trend stopped there and turned to meandering. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 73 bars at a price of 1,947,500. Thereafter, until noon, it struggled around 1,950,000. At the beginning of noon, it fell to 1,940,000. Later, due to the opening of next-day trading, it rebounded slightly. As a result, there was little difference compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars did not change. Black market interest was flat and loose, with interest rates remaining at only about 1.5%.

The US dollar had some spot settlements, and the situation improved slightly. Since the morning opening at 2,470 yuan, buyers have been actively trading. By noon, it had risen to over 2,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell slightly and remained within the 2,500 yuan range. The situation then became sluggish again. As a result, it rose 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar notes were initially firm and then flat, reaching as high as over 570 yuan before settling down slightly. As a result, it was still up 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 560 yuan to 570 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 685 yuan to 695 yuan, the British exchange rate was 9,100 to 9,200 yuan, and the US exchange rate was still inactive.

### A Major Investor Pours Funds into Buying Class C Bonds, Breaking the 1,000 Barrier

Bulls Sell Off and Then Collapse

Government bonds were erratic. A major investor used all of the profits gained in the bond market yesterday to buy Class C bonds. The price rose from around 950 yuan to 1,070 yuan before buying stopped. The bulls then took the opportunity to sell off at high prices, and a collapse occurred. At noon, it fell back to the 800 yuan range. As a result, it rose only slightly compared to the previous close. Class A and B bonds fell slightly, while Dingxu bonds gradually rose slightly.

Dried Seafood Shows Mixed Fortunes

May and June are usually the off-season for dried seafood. Most items are sluggish except for those that are sold in a timely manner. For example, the supply of Coix seeds is very scarce, and sales are in season, so the situation is quite tight. Auctioned Agar-Agar has a large supply. Although it has fallen, its sales are not weak and it is still relatively active. Wood ear and hair seaweed prices have increased due to shortages in the producing areas, so prices are firm. Items such as shrimp tails, raw flour, Qicai, pepper, fennel, sago, and seaweed are sluggish in sales and are all weak.

### More Gold Arrives

A Total of 388,000 Taels

[Our Report] The Central Bank recently shipped another 118 boxes of gold from the United States, totaling more than 388,000 taels. The batch of gold was transported by the "Stoghound" and was completely unloaded into the warehouse yesterday.

### Wuyuan Fried Green Tea is Selling Well

The mid-summer period is usually the peak season for domestic sales of tea. Therefore, buyers from all over have been actively purchasing in recent days, striving to drag it in. Fortunately, the supply and demand are corresponding, and there is no difference in price. However, among them, Wuyuan's newly fried green tea is particularly popular due to the large number of buyers, resulting in an unusually strong price of 180,000 yuan per dan.

### Coal Merchants Hoard and Speculate

In the coal market, screened white coal has been hoarded by holders due to the depletion of existing inventory. The arrival of Yangquan white coal, which is expected to arrive in the next few days, is also being closely watched by them. As a result, there is a shortage of goods circulating in the market, and those who need it are raising prices to compete for purchase, and the market has risen again. White coal powder is also actively sold because the price of coal lumps has increased. The market situation for bituminous coal lumps and coal powder is the same as before. Lumps are very popular and the market price is strong, while powder is sluggish and the market price is weak. Firewood and charcoal prices have risen slightly due to reported price increases in the producing areas.

### Yarn and Cotton Rise Together, Cotton Cloth is Stable

The yarn market continued to soar yesterday. Double Horse still has outlets in South China and rose by another 60,000. The increases in the remaining Jin Cheng and Dafa yarn prices were also 40,000 to 50,000. The gains in smaller and medium-sized yarn prices slowed slightly, rising by only 20,000 to 30,000. Although transactions were sparse, people's confidence was quite firm.

Yesterday, the New York American Cotton Telegraph flew again, rising by 98 to 100 points per pound. The price of nearby American gold was 35.03, the price of forward American gold was 35.39, and the spot price of Metlin hit a new high of 35.84. Spot cotton transactions in this city continued to be active. Shanghai Textile mills such as Xin Sheng, Fuan, Jiafeng, Qingfeng, and Dasheng all made purchases.

The supply of grey fabrics has tightened and there is slight demand from all sides. The market outlook has rebounded. However, Shirting remains stable. Calico's momentum has weakened again as the season is gradually coming to an end. This morning, the Textile Construction Company opened for sale as usual, but the supply of grey fabrics was not strong. Only one grade of 12-pound colored balls was available, and the quantity allocated was only one piece per customer, totaling 40 bolts.

### The US Ban on Cotton Exports Will Not Affect Our Textile Industry

Since the United States lifted price controls, US prices have soared. Even cotton, which has a large existing inventory, has risen from 30 cents per pound to 35 cents. The US authorities therefore issued a ban on US cotton exports some days ago. According to a source in the textile industry, this increase in US cotton prices and the US government's announcement of a ban on cotton exports have no impact on our country. The total cotton stock in our country is more than 800,000 bales, which is sufficient for one year's needs. Furthermore, manufacturers have ordered a large number of US cotton from the United States. As for the $60 million US cotton loan agreed upon by the Central Bank and the United States, only a small portion has been used. Although the US government has announced a ban on US cotton exports, those with existing contracts are not affected. In addition, the cotton producing areas in various parts of our country have a very abundant production this year. The transportation problem can be solved and the supply will naturally be balanced.

### A Large Number of Supplies Arrive in Shanghai from the United States

Diesel, Caustic Soda, Cotton, Iron Bars, etc.:

(Our Report) The "Geraldine Verne" and "Stirling Verne" vessels, managed by Shun Heng Trading Company, arrived in port together yesterday. The "Geraldine" brought over 3,600 barrels of diesel and kerosene, 370 pieces of caustic soda, and 8 boxes of woolen goods, as well as 10,000 pieces of fruit.

### Direct Remittances Between the US and Guangdong

Guangzhou Siyi is the concentration place of overseas Chinese in America. Overseas Chinese remittances to this region used to be transferred from the Shanghai Bank of China to the Guangzhou branch for payment, taking one week to arrive. To facilitate overseas Chinese in the United States, the Bank of China began to handle direct remittances between San Francisco and Guangzhou earlier this month. Siyi includes Zhaoqing, Taishan, Zhongshan, and Xinhui counties. Daily remittances are 10,000 to 20,000.

### Italy has 200 Silk Factories and Approximately 600,000 Silkworm Farming Households; The Italian Government is Vigorously Encouraging It

[Reuters, Rome, 16th] The US Department of Commerce's "Foreign Trade Weekly" stated that the textile industry is Italy's only most important export industry. Among them, the cotton textile industry was originally the most important, with as many as 5,500,000 spindles before the war. As for the export of raw silk, it has always occupied an important position in Italy's foreign trade figures. Among all textile industries, the silk industry is the most widely distributed, because the raw materials for cotton yarn and wool all need to be imported from abroad, while cocoon production is spread throughout the country. At least 600,000 households in the population are engaged in silkworm farming in addition to farming. At present, the government is vigorously encouraging it in order to make up for the import of cotton yarn and wool. The 1946 cocoon production is estimated to reach 40 million pounds, compared to 60 million pounds in 1939 and approximately 100 million pounds between 1919 and 1929. There are currently 200 silk factories, with the manufacturing center in Como.

### Reinsurance Fund

Ministry of Finance Allocates an Additional 4 Billion

In order to alleviate the difficulties of the insurance industry and to prevent foreign exchange leakages, the Ministry of Finance will replenish the reinsurance fund with an additional 4 billion yuan. Together with the previous allocation, the total amount is 5 billion yuan, which will be managed by the China Trust Bureau for reinsurance business. This additional 4 billion yuan will be paid by the national treasury according to temporary needs. In addition, the stamp tax on the insurance industry has exceeded the income of insurance premiums of various insurance companies. After reporting to the Ministry of Finance, it has agreed to reconsider.

### Rice Market Strictly Prohibits Off-Site Transactions; The Grain Review Committee Determines Prices in Producing Areas

The rice market situation is gradually getting back on track and people's confidence is very stable. The goods in each shop are gradually reduced, and the rice stores' absorption is weak. The total number of customer and goods registrations in the North and South markets yesterday was 7,374 shi and 40 bags. In order to make the industry thoroughly understand the mission of the Market Management Committee and to eliminate black market transactions, the Market Management Committee posted a notice yesterday stating: "All industry transactions should be conducted in the North and South markets as centralized trading venues, and no illegal transactions are allowed outside the venues. All market prices should follow the price determined by the Rice and Grain Review Committee as the standard and must not be exceeded. If any of the above situations occur, anyone can report it at any time." At the same time, the Rice and Grain Price Review Committee has established contact with Suzhou and Wuxi to understand the rice prices in various rice producing areas. They can obtain market price information from the producing areas at noon every day. Therefore, in the future, the review of rice prices will be based on the purchase price in the producing areas.

The supply of flour from the mainland is slightly more active, and shops are looking forward to it, but the price is 100 to 200 yuan lower. Bran is weak and continues to fall by 200 yuan. Soybeans rose by more than 1,000 yuan again. Broad beans, mung beans, raw kernels, and yellow sesame remain flat. Bean cake sales in rural areas are agile and prices have gradually increased, rising by another 300 to 400 yuan. Oil prices are rising by more than 2,000 yuan because the arrival is not as strong as sales. The sales of wheat in other ports have become slack and the situation has become weak.

### The United States Prohibits Cotton Exports; Our Textile Industry is Not Affected

Since the United States lifted price controls, US prices have soared. Even cotton, which has a large existing inventory, has risen from 30 cents per pound to 35 cents.

### Taiwan Sugar Priced at 80,000 Yuan Per Dan; Market Price Sells for 94,500 Yuan; Future Allotment Prices Expected to Gradually Decrease

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's sixth allotment of sugar followed the regulations of the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, allotting 15,330 bags of medium-grade sugar to the Sugar Industry Association at a price of 80,000 yuan per shi dan (approximately 50 kg). In addition, 1,030 bags of medium-grade sugar were directly allotted to candy factories and consumer cooperatives.

It is reported that a total of 225 sugar merchants applied to purchase sugar in the sixth allotment, requesting a total quantity of 50,800 bags. However, the stipulated allotment quantity for the sixth period was 15,000 bags. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau negotiated a solution: all applicants requesting 50 bags would receive their full allotment. Those applying for between 50 and 100 bags would be allotted 60 bags. Those applying for between 100 and 200 bags would be allotted 70 bags. For each additional 100 bags requested, 10 bags would be added to the allotment. The intention is to discourage sugar merchants from arbitrarily inflating their application quantities and to encourage them to accurately report their actual sales volume in future applications. Furthermore, it is estimated that allotting 15,000 bags of sugar per week is sufficient to meet normal demand. It is said that 70% of this allotment is transported and sold to other cities. The current sugar inventory is approximately 90,000 bags, enough for six weeks of allotments. A large shipment of Taiwan sugar is expected to arrive in Shanghai successively within these six weeks to replenish the supply.

It is also reported that Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau recently convened a meeting with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and the Sugar Industry Association. It was stipulated that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation would allot 15,000 bags of sugar to the Sugar Industry Association every Tuesday. Yesterday was the sixth allotment, with a marked price of 80,000 yuan per shi dan. Sugar merchants are not allowed to resell to sugar stores for more than 86,000 yuan per shi dan; the Municipal Government will strictly crack down on any violations. When the seventh allotment takes place next Tuesday, the marked price will be reduced to 75,000 yuan per shi dan. Subsequently, the sugar price will be gradually lowered with each weekly allotment, with the aim of restoring normal sugar prices. However, yesterday's market price still hovered around 94,500 yuan per shi dan. According to those familiar with the sugar industry, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's low price of 80,000 yuan per shi dan allotted to sugar merchants already provides them with a profit of 9.9% per bag, as well as an excess of two jin of sugar, totaling a fixed profit of 3,040 yuan. If sold at the stipulated price of 86,000 yuan per shi dan, sugar merchants would profit 9,040 yuan per shi dan. Therefore, at yesterday's market price of 94,500 yuan per shi dan, the profits for sugar merchants are indeed considerable.

Furthermore, it is reported that the sugar market initially fell on the news that the Taiwan Corporation was resuming sales of medium-grade sugar, causing panic. However, the market rebounded as the company's supply was limited. Consequently, local sugar merchants mostly remained on the sidelines. The Association marked the price at 92,000 yuan, but it quickly broke the 90,000 yuan barrier and fell to 88,000 yuan. The morning close was at 90,500 yuan. In the afternoon, for the aforementioned reasons, it returned to 93,500 yuan, 94,500 yuan. Sugar stores were selling at a discount of 2-3,000 yuan. However, sugar stores had no intention to sell due to cost concerns, fearing losses at a price of 80,000 yuan.

### Lingering Heat in Guangdong

—Special Correspondent Liang Feng, Guangzhou Air Dispatch from this Newspaper, 5th

After fighting for eight years, everything has changed a bit! Who would have thought? Even the seasons are a bit different. This year, the southern region is unusually hot, especially early. In recent days, heatwaves have fiercely struck Guangzhou, suffocating people. Since June 21st, the average daily death toll from heatstroke has been over fifty people. Livestock are also suffering from epidemics. Such extraordinary heat, especially so early, is said to be unprecedented in Guangzhou for years.

"Quenching Thirst" is Paramount

"Cholera" is Secondary

Due to the continuous extreme heat, people are seeking ways to cool down and relieve the heat, adding a new dimension to Guangzhou's landscape. Although ice shops are springing up like mushrooms after rain, increasing daily, they are mostly packed, unable to keep up with demand. Residents prioritize quenching their thirst; "cholera" is a secondary concern. Ice and soda factories are selling almost everything they produce, with prices tripling, yet still unable to meet demand. Lychee Bay and the Pearl River waterfront are popular summer retreats, teeming with visitors every evening. Swimming pools are even more crowded. Whether in the western suburbs or on Shamian Island, swimming pools are packed all day, a truly unprecedented scene. Therefore, many speculators are planning to open swimming pools recently. It is said that someone is preparing to invest 10 million yuan to open a giant amusement park called "Cape Red Mansion" on the shore of Lychee Bay, which will feature a swimming pool, dance hall, bar, hotel, ice rink, billiards room, music tea house, and other facilities, truly offering everything. If this amusement park opens, Guangzhou residents will surely find what they seek!

The Food Crisis Appears to Have Been Safely Overcome

In the past half month, food prices have been relatively stable. The food crisis seems to have been safely overcome; currently, food prices in various counties of Guangdong province have gradually decreased.

According to the most recent survey report, the province's 30 million people require approximately 60 million shi dan of food for half a year. Guangdong province has a total cultivated area of 39,989,896 mu, and the early rice crop should yield over 69 million shi dan. However, this year, the early rice crop suffered from irregular rainfall, and it is estimated that the harvest will only be 55% of normal, resulting in a shortage of over 22.2 million shi dan for the early crop. Guangzhou city is estimated to be short of over 5 million dan. This estimated food shortage figure is quite considerable. However, solutions are being implemented. For example, 300,000 shi of rice from Fujian, 100,000 shi from Jiangxi, and 10,000 shi from Zhejiang are being continuously transported to Guangdong for relief. Of course, inter-provincial transportation faces considerable difficulties, and the aid may not be able to address immediate needs. However, many overseas Chinese are donating rice to their homeland for relief, which is being continuously transported. For example, the fifth batch of 4,172 tons of loose rice donated by overseas Chinese in Siam recently arrived in Hong Kong. It is said that this batch of rice will be distributed with 200 tons going to Xiamen, 2,500 tons to Guangzhou and Qiongyai, and 1,492 tons to Chaozhou and Meizhou, which can be said to be good news for the people of Guangdong!

The Fate of Siamese Rice Remains Unclear

Batches of loose rice donated by overseas Chinese in Siam are being continuously transported, but the mystery of the previous sale of Siamese rice in Hong Kong has yet to be revealed. The Municipal Assembly, representing public opinion, is constantly demanding that the Good Relief Branch account for the relief funds, but the accounting is consistently unclear.

At the Municipal Assembly's regular meeting on June 21st, Director Ling of the Good Relief Guangdong Branch was originally invited to report, but Director Ling did not attend that day, sending a representative who could not answer many questions, which made the assembly members very unhappy. Therefore, it was decided to invite Director Ling to personally report at their regular meeting on the 26th. At the designated time, Director Ling finally arrived! The assembly members first brought up Director Ling's statements to reporters in Shanghai, asking him to explain. He only said that the statements did not match the original publication and that he had sent a letter requesting a correction. At the same time, he acknowledged that there were errors in his letter to Mr. Jin Cai, signing his name, published in the Ta Kung Pao, which were due to temporary negligence, and Director Ling apologized. This issue was thus provisionally concluded. However, regarding relief issues, the assembly members asked questions like machine guns. Some of these have been answered, and some require written responses. There are these questions: What is the total amount of special funds received by the province? How much is allocated to Guangzhou? What are the allocation standards? What is the total amount of losses from delayed materials? The numbers published by the branch do not match the records of the Public Works Bureau. What is the reason? The Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway lost over 130 million yuan due to the flour issue. What is the reason?

During the meeting, Assembly Member Zhu Keqin loudly asked, "Why is only 65% of the loose rice distributed to groups? Where did the remaining 35% go? Only people who have lost all conscience could commit such fraudulent acts!" Director Ling's face turned red, and he could only say, "I have not heard of this matter. Is there any evidence?" Assembly Member Zhu replied, "This is an ironclad fact!" When Director Ling left the meeting, Assembly Member Zhu repeated this statement, "Please pay attention to my words. This is an ironclad fact!" Director Ling simply nodded and left.

Communist Troops Retreat North; Pacification Work Begins

The security situation in Guangdong province has improved relatively, but scattered gangs of bandits in the Dongjiang area still harass the region and harm merchants and travelers from time to time. In the past, it was very difficult for the authorities to carry out pacification work because the armed personnel of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had not withdrawn. However, the CCP's armed personnel in Guangdong have now boarded ships to retreat north. Furthermore, the leader of the CCP's Dongjiang Column, Zeng Sheng, has acknowledged that there are no CCP armed forces left in Guangdong province. At the same time, the CCP recently provided assurances to the Guangzhou camp through Colonel Miller, the American representative of the eighth group: (1) As of June 20th, there are no so-called CCP armed personnel in the area north of the Dapeng Peninsula. The CCP cannot recognize other bandits posing under false pretenses. (2) The CCP guarantees that it will abide by its promises in the future and will no longer engage in armed struggle in Guangdong.

Therefore, there are currently no CCP armed personnel in Guangdong province, and any that exist are imposters. Therefore, the military authorities here have launched a comprehensive pacification plan to completely eliminate bandits everywhere within three months. The military measures being implemented are as follows: (1) Re-assigning tasks to the national army and provincial defense security teams throughout the province. (2) Rapidly organizing people's self-defense forces and implementing self-defense and security. Firearms for the self-defense forces of each county will be issued uniformly by the province. (3) Implementing joint suppression and mutual protection plans, holding regional security meetings in various districts.

The meeting for the Beijiang district was held on June 25th, and the pacification meeting for the Guangdong-Jiangxi border area was convened on July 1st. General Zhang Fakui, the Director of the Xingying (military headquarters), and over a hundred officers and soldiers from the Security Deputy Commander's Office personally went to Dongjiang on June 24th to preside over the pacification meetings in the Beijiang district and the Guangdong-Jiangxi district, and to inspect the defense of the northeast Dongjiang area. Hopefully, the security situation in Guangdong will no longer be a problem in the future.

### The Melancholy of Guilin

—Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Guilin Air Dispatch from this Newspaper, 3rd

Depressing midsummer, bleak days, a chillingly desolate ruined city. Annoying wind and rain obscure the sunlight, mountains and rivers, and even the plains are covered with an unfathomable white fog, which extends into people's hearts, so melancholic, so stifling. The inexplicably changing climate has become too bizarre. However, what has changed is more than just the weather?

Hypocritical democracy is like a bright poisonous mushroom growing in a pile of manure. Many people exert tremendous effort, vying to pick one and hang it on the lapel of their long gown or mandarin jacket. Democracy! Why isn't the product of manure fragrant?

The Speaker's Dispute Becomes an Unprecedented Farce

The difficult-to-birth Provincial Assembly continues to be difficult to birth. The dispute over the speaker has created an unprecedented farce. When appealing to the Ministry of Interior for a decision, the two sides (Li Renren, representing the official language faction, and Chen Xizhang, representing the vernacular faction) suddenly held another "consultative meeting," hoping to resolve the speaker's issue through discussion. The result? Finally, "no result" and another unhappy ending. The reason for holding the "consultation" meeting, to put it bluntly, is "there is a reason for everything," somewhat resembling the effect of "pressure." To trace back to the origin would be a long story, too difficult for the word "democracy." Because there is no leader, the assembly has acquired a new, unheard-of name. Because there is no speaker, there is a "Chairman's Meeting," where a council member from each administrative district takes turns acting as chairman. Because the assembly has not been established, the preparatory meeting has changed to a "talk meeting." After the first plenary meeting without a speaker, the many gentlemen realized that many issues could not be resolved in such a meeting. Therefore, they adjourned for two days, rushing to resolve the speaker's issue. The result is "as stated above."

First Meeting Firmly Rejects Reporters' Attendance

Also, there was an event that was both laughable and not laughable at the first meeting. The assembly abruptly rejected reporters' attendance. What was the reason? Please don't laugh: the reason was, "This meeting is discussing internal issues. We fear that the debate will be fierce, leading to blushing faces, which would be unsightly for everyone. Therefore, we temporarily ask the reporters to leave."

The political melancholy, the immaturity of democracy, growing in today's China, no one can blame anyone. To get better, it probably won't get better quickly. Arguing and quarreling, without court proceedings, is already considered a sign of harmony. Ordinary people who understand the situation will understand without saying anything.

The people of Guilin seem to have little interest in the ups and downs of political turmoil or the many incomprehensible disputes. Too much trouble has made them cold as ice to such things. Those with some money are busy planning how to rebuild their homes, without time to care about external affairs. Those without money must get up in the middle of the night and rush to the grain distribution center on Guixi Road to queue up to buy subsidized rice (the price of rice has risen to over 60,000 or 70,000 yuan amid the gentlemen's quarrels). Refugees frown at the notices posted on the streets saying "Repatriation of Refugees, Ends at the End of June." Everyone is in chaos, and they have no leisure to listen to any resolutions, which are definitely not as popular as the news of a few tons of relief flour arriving in Guilin.

Mountain Torrents Erupt, Washing Away Roads and Bridges

Not only political issues are causing melancholy, but also transportation problems, which seem to be fueling the unease in people's hearts. Continuous heavy rains cause mountain torrents to erupt and wash away roads, which then need to be repaired. While repairs should be underway, a dispute arises between national and provincial roads. When the Guangxi Provincial Highway Bureau was about to send workers to repair the ferry crossings, road surfaces, and bridges, the Third District Administration of the Ministry of Transportation's Highway Bureau intervened, saying that this was the Third District Administration's project and that the Provincial Highway Bureau should not interfere, refusing the Provincial Highway Bureau to carry out repairs. As a result, two monks had no water to drink, and all ferry crossings stopped work. The only ones suffering were the rows of cars stranded at the ferry crossings. You can't cross, I can't cross, and the drivers stare blankly at the river. Dispute! Dispute! Dispute! When will the dispute end? Grain transport is cut off in the dispute, and travelers sell all their luggage in the dispute. The entire lifeblood of Guangxi is thus hardened by the dispute! If there weren't news of the "Liuzhou-Guilin-Xiyi Railway opening to traffic in October" to comfort people, it would be too infuriating.

A Major Murder Case to Be Publicly Tried Soon

In the melancholic atmosphere, the only somewhat stimulating thing is a major murder case that is about to be publicly tried. The main culprits are Ni Zhongtao, who served as the "Inspector Commissioner" and "Security Commander" of the "Second Administrative District" during the occupation of Guiliu, and Guo Yongzhang, the "Deputy Commander of the Liuzhou District Militia." The person wrongly killed was He Wenyun, the magistrate of Luocheng County. He Wenyun was a well-known magistrate in the Guibei area during the war against the enemy, but Ni Zhongtao shot him for the unfounded reason that he wanted to concurrently hold the position of Luocheng County magistrate. Naturally, the people were outraged and unanimously called for the strict punishment of this confused commissioner. After the liberation of Guiliu, Ni Zhongtao was immediately detained, and the Guilin District Court Prosecutor's Office filed a public lawsuit. Because the case involved significant issues, it was decided to specially organize a collegiate panel for trial, scheduled to open next week. It is indeed rare in Guangxi for a commissioner to arbitrarily kill a magistrate and end up in prison. Being able to punish a commissioner does indeed involve unspeakable twists and turns.

A Public Case Involves Ouyang Yuqian

In recent days, there has also been a public case in Guilin involving a playwright. This playwright is named Ouyang Yuqian. Because the military morale items handled by Mr. Ouyang before the evacuation of Guilin were somewhat unclear, people are digging up old cases and questioning "Where did the military morale items go?" in the newspapers. Mr. Ouyang was very unhappy and replied, "The military morale items have all been distributed to the various units of the Guilin garrison. There is evidence to prove it." However, "the person in charge of the receipts is scattered in various places," so he still needs to "send letters to collect them and publish them to the public." Finally, he said that he was about to leave, but because of a foot ailment, he "has not yet left." It is strange that cultural figures residing in Guilin do not have a good impression on the local people. For example, after the Zhang Xinfu incident, Mr. Mu Mutian actually said everywhere that "Zhang Xinfu was assassinated by Kuomintang agents." This kind of argument is really headache-inducing. It is admirable that cultural figures love democracy, but it is inevitable that they will offend the public if they speak carelessly.

Putting down my pen and looking out the window, I see a refugee as thin as dried bamboo sitting on the grass, frowning, lowering his head, and tightening the belt on his stomach one degree at a time, until his stomach is as small as a bowl. Then, he struggles to pick up his bamboo cane and walks towards the road in the rain. Ah, this melancholic city of Guilin!

### Radar and Navigation Safety

Radar devices, which were used by the Navy during the war, have now become important instruments to assist in transportation. With the guidance of radar, ships have overcome many obstacles and eliminated many dangers. Recently, the steamship "Lee H. Richmond" sailed from Baltimore, Maryland, to Norfolk, Virginia, a 185-mile nighttime voyage, relying entirely on radar guidance, which proves the importance of radar for navigation.

The radar device consists of two parts: a rotating radar antenna on top of the wheelhouse and a receiver-indicator on the bridge. This device can display images of ships and coastal obstacles within a range of 100 yards to 32 miles.

During the ship's trial run, the cathode ray tube displayed images of ships anchored in the ocean and coastal scenery. Even in dense fog, clear images could be displayed. Other objects, such as buoys and small islands in the sea, could also be seen clearly.

### Relief for Flood Victims and Refugees in Jiangsu Province; 50 Tons of Locusts Eradicated; "China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Distributes Flour for Work Relief

Since its official establishment on January 16th of this year, the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRA) Jiangsu Branch has actively promoted civil engineering projects such as the Ling River road repair and dike construction, using work-for-relief methods. As of the end of this month, the branch has completed the earthen dike project on the southern Jiangsu seacoast, the dredging project of the Zhenwu Canal, the three Bama engineering project of the Jiangbei Canal returning to the Yangtze River, small-scale river dredging and dike construction projects in more than ten counties including Zhenjiang, Wujin, and Jiangyin, the Five Rivers and Six Dikes project in Huaian and Guanyun in the Communist-controlled area, and other scattered work-relief projects in various places. According to reporters, as of the end of this month, a total of 700,000 workdays of disaster-stricken laborers and refugees in the province have been mobilized, completing 850,000 cubic meters of earthwork, dredging more than 20,000 meters of the Xuzhou sewer system, and completing two water-blocking dams in the Jiangbei Canal, benefiting the local area and providing relief to disaster victims, with widespread effects. Since the busy farming season is approaching, and disaster-stricken laborers and refugees can participate in rural work, this first phase of work-relief projects will soon end. Employees will be reassigned to use this busy farming period to conduct design testing of various water conservancy projects, so that the branch can greatly improve water conservancy roads in the region after the autumn, laying the foundation for post-disaster relief efforts. The branch also reports that locust plagues are severe this year in Nanjing, Baguazhou, Jurong, Jiangpu, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, and Piaoshui. Since April, thousands of disaster-stricken laborers and refugees in various places have been mobilized to dig up eggs and catch nymphs, and flour is issued based on weight for work-relief. As of the end of June, more than 50 tons of jumping nymphs and more than 2,000 jin of locust eggs have been eradicated. In Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other places, the work of controlling rice borers has been launched, and demonstration areas for drug prevention and control have been designated. Various Baohan Borer Associations have been organized to actively promote work-relief borer control work. Recently, in the demonstration areas of Wuxi and Suzhou, a large amount of DDT powder, totaling three and a half tons, has been distributed in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Educational Institute, covering more than 1,600 mu of rice seedling fields, with remarkable results. Many people have gone to visit and observe. It is said that several reporters from the Associated Press and Mr. Geling, the chief agricultural expert stationed in China by the United Nations, have also gone to investigate and observe, and added instructions, believing that the results are satisfactory.

### Unwise Neighbor

(Today's China is no longer the fragile "China" of old, so no country can use the arrogant and conceited attitude of 1900 to look down on China again. To still view today's China in this way only proves one's own lack of wisdom.

Those who have observed and studied the outbreak of this great war and its tortuous rise and fall will know that the Axis powers failed entirely because they encountered China's strong and heroic long-term resistance from the beginning of their aggression, just as a great thief is captured or a mighty lion is caught because it suffers a fatal wound at the start. In essence, the victory of the anti-Axis nations came from the strong and heroic long-term resistance of China.

If on November 20, 1937, when Nanjing fell, our highest authorities had not resolved to resist, we would not bear to imagine the Japanese Rising Sun flag flying over the entirety of China today. What we would even less bear to imagine is that today's Siberia would probably have already become a "recreation area" for the Japanese Kwantung Army. People often praise the beauty and magnificence of the Empire State Building's top, but they should also remember the underlying structures that support it and bear the heavy load. Today, the European powers are at the top, and China is the underlying structure.

Whether today's China is a girl who takes advantage of and manipulates the conflicts and contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union to gain a large amount of happiness and profit, or a country that suffers losses and misfortunes due to the opposition and hostility between the United States and the Soviet Union, we believe that today's China should act as a sincere mediator, not a pitiful scapegoat.

Molotov is one of the most outstanding diplomatic figures in the international community. He should remember the sympathy and friendship that China's chief representative, President Soong Tzu-wen, gave him during the tense atmosphere of the "rotating chairmanship" system proposal and vote at the San Francisco Conference.

Molotov should know that the establishment and consolidation of China's position as one of the four great powers did not come from the Paris Conference under today's swords and shadows, but had already been settled in the performances at the Tehran and Yalta conferences. Therefore, if Molotov wants to deny China's qualification as an inviting nation, that is, to deny China's qualification as "one of the four great powers," he should have raised it during the Cairo, Tehran, London, San Francisco, and other conferences.

The situation inside China's opaque window today will not exist and linger in China forever. The state of civil war and internal strife today is like the darkness before dawn, like an arrow of time approaching. People should know that the moon thinking in stillness will appear in the cloudy and foggy sky in the morning. Just like the solar eclipse, the sun will still shine upon the earth. Therefore, people abroad should not use the current opaque national conditions of China as a reason or basis to look down on China.

Molotov's proposal will not only discard all the friendship of the past twenty years since the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, but also make the five hundred million people of China feel infinitely disappointed in their earnest expectations of the Soviet Union, and will cause deep pain to conscientious citizens of various small and weak nations around the world. Today, the Soviet Union seems to want to change its compassionate life preserver into a rope to drown people.

A history of the modern world and European diplomacy is not lacking in examples of self-deception. When the protagonist of the future Third World War, "Hitler II," performs his pathetic "setting sun over a lonely city" scene, he will remember the value and preciousness of China's friendship and assistance today. There is a Western saying: "If you don't make small repairs, you will have to make big repairs." The time for Molotov to make small repairs to China's friendship and diplomatic relations is today. It must be known that only the mainstream of history can stir up the waves of human justice, and the obstacles created by the times will always be destroyed by these waves. Here, we sincerely wish that our unwise neighbor today can become our wise friend tomorrow. (Dai Meiling)

### Military Police Discharge

Editor:

I am a military policeman who has served for more than six years and is now being discharged. Sir, although we did not personally fight on the front lines during the War of Resistance, our work in suppressing bandits, maintaining security, and maintaining military discipline never stopped. Although we have no achievements, we should have some hard work, right?

During the War of Resistance, we endured any pain. We only wanted national victory. What is a little material pain? The country was indeed victorious, but we, this group of military police who overcame thousands of hardships, were discharged.

Discharge is understandable because it is the beginning of demobilization. We have no complaints. But it is very painful that when we leave, even our clothes are taken away. We are not allowed to wear a single set, let alone money.

We only have a few thousand dollars a month. How can we afford civilian clothes? If our clothes are taken away, aren't we going to be naked? Later, after repeated requests, we were allowed to wear a set of torn military uniforms and a set of torn shirts. Sir, tell me, isn't that heartbreaking?

Sir, please publish this letter so that the officers can see it and show some compassion to the comrades who have been discharged but have not yet left! (A Discharged Military Policeman)

### Economic Loopholes

Editor: Is the exorbitant profit of state-run yarn factories for enriching the national treasury? Is the exorbitant profit of privately-run yarn factories also for enriching the national treasury? This is the first thing I don't understand. Silk is a major product and the only source of foreign exchange, but silk factories are allowed to go bankrupt. Although the government subsidizes one million yuan per dan, it is still below cost. Why not reduce the exorbitant profits of private yarn factories to subsidize the losses of silk factories? This is the second thing I don't understand. Prices are so high, and the scope of transactions is terribly large, but the 0.15% business tax is universally evaded. Probably the current industrial and commercial sectors only declare a few percent or a few tenths of a percent. Why is the tax authority turning a blind eye? Is it corruption? Is the treasury so flush? This is the third thing I don't understand. Large businesses issue invoices for tens of thousands of yuan, and small businesses issue invoices for thousands of yuan. The stamp tax should be considerable, but I have never seen the authorities sell stamp tax tickets with a face value of more than ten thousand yuan. It is always limited to four hundred yuan. How can we affix them? Are we teaching people to evade taxes? Is it okay to underpay? Is the cost of paper and printing not worth the money? This is the fourth thing I don't understand. Given all of this, the country is poor and the treasury is empty, and the economy is in danger. Why doesn't the authority think of some ready-made solutions? (Reader Cui Zi'an)

### Passive Registration

After the victory of the War of Resistance, my home in northern Jiangsu was occupied by the Communist army. They implemented a policy of terror. Anyone with prestige, assets, knowledge, or a profession is in danger of being killed or having their property confiscated at any time. As a result, farmers cannot farm, workers cannot work, merchants cannot trade, and students cannot study. The people are destitute and wander to other places, looking like homeless dogs. More than three million refugees have wandered to various parts of southern Jiangsu. During the day, they beg to make a meager living, and at night, they sleep on the streets without clothes or food. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness! Now, thanks to the government and the enthusiasm of all sectors, generous donations have been made to help the refugees from northern Jiangsu. Yesterday, the registration procedure was held at the Tianchan Theater. I participated with my relatives and friends. On that day, thousands of refugees lined up in a queue. Working comrades held chalk and wrote down numbers to register in order and obtain receipts. Then, they went back on their own. I said that the relief is just a drop in the bucket and not a fundamental solution. The refugees from northern Jiangsu originally had professions. Wandering in other places is not a long-term solution. Therefore, I hope that the government and all people will quickly devise a way to return to their hometowns and resume their livelihoods. This is the best policy. (Elementary School Student Shao Anlai)

### Governesses and Rickshaw Pullers Should Have Price Limits

Editor: The difficulty of living in Shanghai is well known to everyone. Even the cost of hiring a servant has increased. I think many people must be feeling a headache. I must specifically bring it up and ask everyone to pay attention to improvement.

(1) Governesses: Most of the people living in Shanghai who are boarders hire one or two governesses. Most of these governesses are introduced by employment agencies. Since last winter, a group of wealthy old men and tycoons have hired governesses regardless of the situation. No matter how high the wages are, they are not afraid. As a result, the wages that were only 500 or 600 yuan in early spring this year jumped to 2,000 yuan, then to 5,000 yuan, then to 10,000 yuan, and recently even to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. As for the employment agencies, they charge the employer a commission of three months' salary. For example, if a governess is hired for a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan, they must pay a commission of 90,000 yuan. For 50,000 yuan, they must pay 150,000 yuan. The employment period is only one month. If the governess does not continue to work after the expiration date, the employment agency is not responsible. If you hire another one, you have to pay another commission. As a result, a huge problem has arisen, that is, the employment agencies often collude with many governesses. After agreeing on the conditions with the employer, they immediately start working. After working for one month, they quit for some reason. The commission obtained by the employment agency is split between the two. Many families have been harmed. Readers, under this situation, how can you hire a governess? The Social Affairs Bureau should have a method of banning the employment agencies. We must not allow this scam to exist and harm the people.

(2) Private Rickshaw Pullers: For the sake of commuting to work, it is necessary to have a rickshaw, which is more economical than hiring one. Unexpectedly, a group of private rickshaw pullers have an unusually dark heart. Since this year, the monthly wages have increased from 10,000 yuan to 50,000 or 80,000 yuan. Board and lodging are provided by the employer. Still, they feel it is too little. Recently, I heard that some are even demanding an increase to more than 100,000 yuan, which is really shocking. I am specifically raising this issue. How much is the monthly salary of public employees hired by the state? How much is the monthly pay of the national defense soldiers who protect the country and defend the people? No wonder it is not as high as the income of private rickshaw pullers! If this continues, everyone will want to be a private rickshaw puller, which is ridiculous! It should also be stipulated by the social government that the monthly wages of private rickshaw pullers should not exceed a certain amount of yuan, and this can also prevent farmers from the countryside from coming to the city and changing their profession to rickshaw pullers, which is beneficial to agricultural production.

### Clearing Accumulations of Filth

Editor: The western part of Shanghai is full of factories and a densely populated area for the poor. The nearby shallow beaches are silted up, and the stench is nauseating. Especially near our factory, on the sides of the intersection of Pinlang Road and Hede Road, residents casually pile up garbage and filth on the roadside. Pedestrians cover their noses. In this hot summer, there is an epidemic. It is very detrimental to hygiene. If no action is taken to ban it and find a way to remove it, it will harm the health of the residents. I am writing this letter to ask the health authorities to pay attention. I beg you to disclose it. (Wei Hongqing)

### Reply to Readers on Industry and Commerce

(1) Xu Linxiang from Nantong asks: I have long admired your newspaper for its untiring efforts to serve its readers! I am very impressed! Now there is a question that I would like to ask you to investigate and answer: (1) Is the raw starch mentioned in the dried goods section the same as sweet potato starch or mung bean starch? (2) Where is the market for buying large quantities of mung bean starch? Please also inquire about its source (i.e., place of origin).

[Reply from the Commercial News Editor of this Newspaper] Raw starch is produced in Singapore and other places and is similar to arrowhead starch. In addition to being used for food, it can also be used for sizing cloth. All seafood and foreign goods stores on Foreign Firm Street in this city sell it. Mung bean starch is a raw material for making bean starch noodles and is obtained from Zhenjiang and other places.

(2) Gu Zhiqi asks: Editor, I currently have some shares of the Commercial Press that I want to sell urgently. However, according to reports, only a few popular stocks are traded frequently, and the price of paper stocks is sometimes not listed at all. Although I have tried to find out in many ways, I have not been able to find anything. I want to go to school next semester, but I am in financial straits and have no support from home. Out of desperation, I implore your newspaper to point me in the right direction so that I can get financial help and focus on my studies.

[Reply from the Commercial News Editor of this Newspaper] Shares of the Commercial Press are traded every day and can be bought and sold through securities firms.

(3) Zhang Xiaojie from Zhenjiang asks: A reader was introduced by a friend and plans to work in Taiwan, but he lacks travel experience and is unfamiliar with the route. Now I have three questions. I pray that you will answer them in the newspaper: (1) Do I need a certificate or passport? (2) What is the weight limit for luggage? (3) What is the price of a boat ticket and a plane ticket?

[Editor's Reply] For information on travel to Taiwan and procedures, you can consult the Taiwan Provincial Government's Shanghai Liaison Office (4th floor of China Merchants Bureau, 5 Ma Road, Bund) in Shanghai. Please bring all your documents with you. All senior personnel with visas can take the plane for free, while junior and middle-level personnel wait for a boat. If you have relatives and friends in Shanghai to stay with, you can save a lot of travel expenses. It is hot in Taiwan, so it is best to bring as little luggage as possible.

### Reader Donations Respond to the Orphan and Widow Relief Fund

Social Needs Are Urgent and Awaiting Assistance

Dear Sir: I deeply agree with the Qinxia Elderly and the Jialin Student Loan Fund's entrustment of your newspaper to handle the Orphan and Widow Relief Fund. I am sending a check for 500,000 yuan and hope that it will be used for the case. Sincerely, Jin Deqi.

[Editor's Note] This column, entrusted by the Qinxia Elderly, has already approved the subsidy for two batches of eight people to relieve orphans, widows, and the poor and sick. Recently, the number of applicants has increased day by day, which shows that in a large city like Shanghai, there are many people who are helpless and have no one to turn to. This column believes that this relief is very urgent and has profound significance. It is necessary to expand fundraising due to the limited funds. Yesterday, a person named "Jin De" sympathized with this relief cause and sent a staff member to donate 500,000 yuan. This gentleman also did not want to reveal his real name, but said, "Doing good does not require fame." His kindness is admirable.

### Service Briefs

### Where Is Chinese Painting Heading?

— Wang Yingyuan

In recent years, the chaos in the Chinese painting world has been simply overwhelming and confusing. Because the essence of the Song and Yuan dynasties cannot be continued, and an orthodox painting school has not been established, the large-scale absorption of Western painting has caused the instability of traditional Chinese painting. These are all preludes to the new development of academics, which is naturally exciting. But it is a pity that the Western painting and Chinese painting schools are too deeply divided, and they are mutually hostile. In the art school, due to the different theoretical schools, there is alienation between professors and professors, and between students and students. Almost even the clothes between the departments are not pleasing to the eye. Of course, there are similar phenomena in other academics, such as the Chinese Literature Department and the Foreign Literature Department are also rarely harmonious. However, I feel that the progress of academics should be in the theoretical discussions and should not be expressed outwardly with emotion, focusing only on right and wrong between people.

In the current Chinese painting world, pure Chinese painting and pure Western painting are two extremes. The theoretical struggle is naturally inevitable. However, there are too many branches and schools between the two extremes. In terms of form and technique, there are those who have emerged from Western painting sketches and use Chinese painting ink, and those who have emerged from Chinese painting and have Western painting composition or have Western painting colors. When painting characters, there are those with Western anatomy, and there are also pure Western painting forms, taking Chinese painting themes and artistic conceptions. In short, they are intertwined with each other, almost indistinguishable. Each small school also holds its own opinions, scolding each other. What is the combination of Chinese and Western, what is the separation of China and Japan, what is oil canvas better than rice paper, and what is a brush stronger than a brush, what is a strong color better than a light and elegant one, and what is transcendence better, making it extremely chaotic. In fact, it should be understood that the various backgrounds and elements of the production of artworks, as well as the general trend of artistic development, can avoid external conflicts.

Based on the research results of human cultural evolution history, we can probably know that every time other cultures are flourishing, new art is always budding, and then it will develop brilliantly later. Few arts are in a leading position, and the trend of cultural development is determined by regional environment, historical background, philosophical thought, religious belief, political characteristics, diplomacy, internal affairs, economy, transportation, etc. When art is produced, in addition to the above elements, there are also factors such as climate and materials. Because artworks have to go through two key points: one is the psychological condition of the writer, and the other is social public decision. Artworks that violate the above conditions and factors will be naturally eliminated and decline, even if they are produced. When you create an art that is ahead of its time, society has no ability to accept it and is criticized. When you never improve, you will be abandoned by society. A few years ago, when various new schools in Europe (such as Matisse and Picasso) rose for a while, they were like flashes in the pan and immediately became traces in art history. Our country once advocated it, and as a result, those who learned Fauvism and those who learned Cubism later became Chinese painters.

However, when the time is not ripe, it is absolutely impossible to compromise. Forced assembly becomes an unnatural thing, that is to say, the emergence of an orthodox new school is not that simple. There must be cultural exchanges (according to Professor Xu Beihong, it is necessary to wait for a large number of Chinese and Western marriages) before the new culture gradually merges Chinese and Western art into one furnace. As far as the new Chinese painting is concerned, there will be a real new school of Chinese painting at that time. It is by no means that current painters bring a little Western painting color and composition, which is called the combination of Chinese and Western, and it is not that easy.

When that time comes, what kind of posture will this new school appear in? We can speculate that in terms of production materials, new tools and new materials will be discovered, in terms of materials, the scope will definitely be expanded, and the standards of themes will have to be shifted. The brushwork and brush strength may be maintained. In terms of content, it will change due to the influence of foreign new cultures, but because China has thousands of years of traditional culture, philosophical background, national character, outlook on life, etc., the artistic conception expressed will never destroy all the essence of the past, and completely take Western painting to replace it.

### Ah Cui (A Novel) - Part 1

— Zhong Yuan

Six years ago, we had a young maid in our house named Ah Cui.

She was a seventeen-year-old country girl who, while not exactly beautiful, had a pointed oval face and was fairly well-featured. When she first came, she was probably only fifteen, wearing a short shirt and trousers of willow-patterned cloth, red foreign socks, green shoes, and two pink velvet ribbons tied on her greasy braid. With this getup, she could have certainly attended a wedding banquet in the countryside, but in the city, it was inevitably a bit out of place. I looked at her braid and couldn't help but laugh. Unexpectedly, she was very perceptive. The next morning, when she came to sweep my room, she brought a pair of scissors and a comb, and said to me with a smile:

"Miss, I know you laughed at my braid yesterday. In the countryside, I heard long ago that city girls all cut their hair. I argued with my mother, but she always refused to let me cut it. Now that I'm out, my mother can't control me anymore. Miss, I heard you're good at cutting hair. Thank you, please cut my braid for me, okay?"

"How did you know I can cut hair?" I asked in surprise.

"How could I not know! Little Xiang from next door told me!" She took a few steps forward with a smile, standing in front of me and saying, "Sister Xiao Xiang said that you even cut the hair of their eldest young mistress and second young lady, and that you cut better than the barber!"

When I cut Ah Cui's braid, I discovered that this country girl was quite remarkable. Not only was she quick-witted, lively, and good at socializing, but she had also befriended Sister Xiao Xiang next door after only one day. When I untied her greasy braid and cut it off with two snips, a white substance appeared on the back of her neck. I rubbed it with my finger, and it was a bit sticky. I sniffed it, and sure enough, it was the newly bought "Love's Cream" that I had left downstairs by the tree!

Ah Cui's love of beauty seemed a bit excessive. On Sunday evenings, whenever the weather was nice and there was a moon, my mother always liked to take me and my younger brother out for a walk. I can't remember how many times I happily held my younger brother's hand and came back from outside, went upstairs, and stepped into my own room, only to be startled by Ah Cui's slyly grinning face in front of the mirror. Of the dozen or so cheongsams that I had, she had probably tried on every single one. My fleece-lined jacket, leather shoes, and even stockings, she all wanted to "taste."

However, I must admit that Ah Cui was a rare and good servant. She was clever, quick, and even better at reading faces and understanding situations. She arranged everything neatly before anyone even asked. Sometimes, seeing me in a bad mood, she would automatically go to Yun Fang's house next door to borrow some novels and ask me, "Miss, why don't you read a book to relieve your boredom!"

On Ah Cui's sixteenth birthday, my mother gave her four dollars, telling her to go to a restaurant to eat a bowl of noodles and buy whatever else she liked with the rest. She thanked us with a smile and went out, but didn't return for a long time. I guessed that she wouldn't be willing to spend the four dollars on food. She must have gone to buy some cloth, rouge, silk stockings, and other things. Unexpectedly, when she came back in the evening, her hands were empty, and she brought nothing back. I asked her if she had eaten the noodles, and she shook her head. When she opened her mouth to smile at me, a sparkling gold tooth appeared in her mouth!

Loving beauty is certainly not a bad thing, but Ah Cui's flaws definitely came from her love of beauty. Since the day she had the gold tooth installed, she gradually became less settled. Whenever she had a free moment, she would sneak out, and would always be gone for two or three hours. She also desperately applied face powder to her face four or five times a day, wishing she could make it as white as a wall. Fragrant soap, cold cream, and cologne were all ready. The shelf in the kitchen was almost her dressing table.

One day, I was walking on the street. The sun was shining brightly at first, but suddenly it started to rain. I wanted to brave the rain and rush back, but then I thought that getting soaked and catching a cold or triggering my old illness was no small matter, so I stepped onto the steps of a shop to take shelter from the rain.

I didn't pay attention to what kind of shop it was. I wasn't the only one taking shelter from the rain. A row of people stood in front like a screen, blocking my view. Suddenly, amidst the sound of the pouring rain, a series of sharp "giggling" sounds rang out. Surprised, I peeked between the shoulders of two old men in front of me to look across the street, only to realize that it was a dental shop. I saw a young man of about twenty standing at the door, flirting with Ah Cui...

I couldn't find a reason for myself, but I kept the matter a deep secret. However, it couldn't be concealed forever. One night, Ah Cui tried to sneak out through the back door after we were all asleep, but was finally discovered by my mother, who immediately went out to search for her. As a result, she found Ah Cui and the young man from the dental shop in a small inn...

The young man's name was Ah Shun. I heard that he was fired by his boss the next day. My mother asked someone to send a letter to Ah Cui's mother in the countryside to prevent anything else from happening.

Ah Cui's mother was a woman in her thirties with a pockmarked face and slanted eyes. Actually, she wasn't her mother, but her mother-in-law. Ah Cui had been taken in as a child bride. Because her son died before they could consummate the marriage, she treated Ah Cui as her own daughter. On a day when the New Year gongs and drums were beating lively, Ah Cui's mother rushed out from the countryside, bringing some brown sugar sponge cake, shredded radish cakes, and long-stemmed vegetables. As soon as she saw people, she shouted "Congratulations and get rich!"

That night, Ah Cui let her hair down, tears and snot streaming down her face, stamping her feet and crying:

"I won't go back even if I die... I won't go back even if I die..."

"You little slut! You dare curse on the first day of the New Year in front of the lady's door, I'll tear your mouth apart..." Ah Cui's mother's slanted eyes turned up, and after slapping her a few times, she turned around, saw me beside her, and said with some apology: "Miss! As soon as I received the lady's letter, I wanted to come out and take this little slut back, but I was too busy with the farm work to leave. I'm really sorry to disturb you at the beginning of the New Year!..."

The next morning, at the break of dawn, Ah Cui came to my room with a package to say goodbye, her eyelids swollen like walnuts, her throat still sobbing. When she saw me, a flood of tears rolled down again, and she sobbed for a long time, seemingly afraid to say something. After I asked her repeatedly, she said that Ah Shun lived at No. 15, Baojia Lane, West Gate, and she had no way to say goodbye to him. She wanted me to find a way to send him a message, saying that she had been forced back by her mother.

"Miss: Tell Ah Shun, I will never forget him even if I die... I will still come out even if I die!..." After I agreed to help her find a way, she said that while sobbing and clenching her teeth.

I can never forget Ah Cui's appearance that morning. She cried so much that she became a river of tears, her pointed oval face turning pale. I helped her to the door of the room and put two newly bought floral handkerchiefs into her palm and said:

"I'm giving you these two handkerchiefs as a souvenir. Don't be sad. A young man like Ah Shun may not be reliable. You're young, it's too late to be fooled! Your family has land, your mother is taking you back to protect you..." I hadn't finished speaking when she snatched up and said with a sob:

"Miss: You don't have to persuade me,... sob sob!... I've already seen through it,... land is fake, parents are fake,... apart from Ah Shun, nothing in the world is real,... I've already seen through it,... seen through it!..." She stepped out of my room, turned her head and said to me: "Miss:... please don't forget!... I have seen through it, only Ah Shun is sincere... sob..." and then went with her mother, crying.

After Ah Cui went back, there was no news for half a year. One day, an old country woman came from nowhere, holding a red paper package in her hand, and swaying into our courtyard, shouting loudly: "Is this the Zhang family? Miss Ah Cui asked me to send a piece of wedding cake to the lady, miss and A'guan to eat!"

Hearing "Ah Cui", everyone was shocked. After my mother invited the old woman to sit in the parlor, she asked:

"Is Ah Cui married? Who did she marry?"

"She married a good-natured young man,..." the old woman looked around stealthily, and said in a low voice: "There are no outsiders here, it's okay to say, Miss Ah Cui chose him herself, a young man named Lin Sheng from their neighboring village. At first, her mother refused, but later Lin Sheng asked someone to speak up several times before she agreed. They got engaged last month, and they had their wedding on the third of this month. The young couple is really in love!" The old woman said with a beaming smile.

The first time Ah Cui came to the city to play after her marriage was in late autumn when chrysanthemums were in full bloom. I still remember that there was a small caterpillar in the light purple chrysanthemum she had stuck in her hair. After I caught it for her, I asked her:

"Why did you grow your hair out again? Didn't you specifically ask me to cut it off for you?"

"People in the countryside all comb their hair, Lin Sheng asked me to keep it, and I wanted to keep it too, because..." she didn't go on, but looked at her belly happily and shyly. Her belly was very high. She told me that she had only been married for three months and ten days, but the child in her belly seemed to be at least six months old.

After lunch, Ah Cui asked me to accompany her to the street to buy some children's clothing material. Inadvertently, we passed by that dental shop again. I looked at her, seeing that she was acting as if nothing had happened and didn't look at the shop at all, so I asked her:

"Ah Cui, do you still remember Ah Shun?"

She paused slightly, but then smiled and said to me: "Miss, you have a good memory! What Ah Shun, no Ah Shun! Miss, to tell you the truth, I have seen through it, as long as the man is kind and gentle, they are all the same! Ah Shun was sincere to me, and Lin Sheng is also sincere,..." Saying this, she turned her head and smiled at me, the gold tooth still shining brightly in her mouth. However, in addition to the gold tooth, there was also something sparkling in her face, that is, her eyes. I saw that her eyes revealed joy and contentment after being immersed.

When Ah Cui was about to leave, she said that she would send red eggs to us when she gave birth, but she still didn't send them after a year. Some people said that her village was not peaceful, and Japanese devils came to rob and set fire to the village, and most of the villagers fled to other places.

Unexpectedly, another year passed, and on such a gloomy afternoon, Ah Cui came again.

Even my younger brother felt it was a little strange, pulling my sleeve and asking repeatedly: "Why has Ah Cui become so ugly?" She seemed to be ten years older. Although she still had her hair combed back neatly into a bun, the hair had fallen out, leaving only a thin patch that was dry and yellow. Her dark blue cloth coat was still made in our place, but it had already had holes. She lowered her face, which had been tanned to a soy sauce color, looked at the package in her hand, called out "Miss..." and her eyes turned red. (To be continued)

### Journey

— Lin Yongquan

The highway is like a sugared ribbon, with countless ant-cars attached to it, crawling on it.

The car is like a string of ducklings coming from the upper reaches of a winding river.

The car travels, the car tail drags a roll of dust, humming a "put...put..." song, speeding merrily from the flat road, appearing alertly in the mountain bend, suddenly disappearing in the valley.

In the days of blooming flowers, the tender spring breeze scatters colorful colors across the earth. The peach blossoms along the road welcome the car with their beautiful faces; the plum blossoms and cherry blossoms all over the mountains and fields also wave to the travelers in the car with their plain-colored flower buds. The happy car window constantly shows flower branches, lining up colorful reds and purples, and the travelers have nostalgia and warm dreams.

Look at that grassland, that flat grassland where horses are grazing, why aren't there any people playing ball there? The simple horses must not have been to the city and have not seen the Jeeps galloping in the city. Our long, galloping, fast-moving car team is even more unfamiliar to them. They stare with surprised eyes, their ears standing straight up.

What distant mountains, countless arm veins, countless peaks, endless forests and deep valleys. The ribbon of the highway has no trace of people on the road, no pavilions or houses, how desolate, how rough, how lonely and scary.

We have reached another provincial boundary. The clear river gushes out from the distant valley, and rows of tall bamboo on both sides of the bank bend towards the river, bend towards the highway, and bend towards the tired travelers with their foxtail-like long hats.

I haven't seen banana trees for a long time, they are still pointing to the car with green palms, waving to the car, and those teams that seem to be palms connecting with palms, are they welcoming the car? I say remotely with comfort: "Have you been well?"

Still stacks of crescent-shaped paddy fields surround the mountains, reflecting clumps of mountain cypresses; still lush green broad beans and wheat seedlings with hairpins, bustling bees and butterflies are flying around and patrolling.

After passing around a hill, you can see the Yangtze River from afar. The clear sandy shore is lined with a long stream. White sails that sway with the wind fly to the distance. The bird sounds and water sounds in the bridge forest and longan forest on both sides echo each other. The earth is a piece of green, full and harmonious.

At night, I sit alone in the riverside restaurant, leaning on the fishing fire by the river, leaning on the distant people who cannot be seen.

Turning onto the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, what a prosperous and famous highway, but why are there so many wrinkles, so many waves? Are the road maintenance workers neglecting their duties? Have the people in charge of the road bureau forgotten? It's a pity that our car, we are bumping and uneasy, almost sinking into the road of the sea!

I will leave here tomorrow morning, leave the small town on the Tuojiang River. I am worried that the other city that I have been separated from for a long time is too unfamiliar. I sent a telegram before the trip, "××I will arrive at × at 15:00, I hope to wait for me at the ×× station," when I came out of the telegraph office, I saw the distant mountains and rivers were misty like mist, and I was about to walk towards the misty place again, I fell into a misty dream.

### Double Flight Together (87)

— Zhao Qingge

As time went on, she attracted the attention of a female teacher. The female teacher did not know who Lihua was, but thought she was a studious child who was unable to study. Therefore, she felt sympathy for her. One day, when Lihua was about to run out again, she stopped her.

"Do you want to study?" the female teacher asked Lihua.

"Yes," Lihua replied, lowering her head and blushing.

"Have you ever gone to school before?" the female teacher asked again.

"No," Lihua shook her head and said.

"Give me the little notebook in your hand," the female teacher asked Lihua for her little notebook to look at, in a tone of treating a student.

Lihua refused, and was too shy to let her have it, hiding the little notebook behind her back. But suddenly the naughty Liyun snatched it and handed it to the female teacher. After reading it, the female teacher looked at Lihua in surprise and said:

"You write very well, you don't seem to have never gone to school."

"I used to read with my father, but I never went to school," Lihua said softly. She felt a kind of joy. Joy for the female teacher's praise!

"Then why don't you go to school? Where are you from? What is your family doing here?" The female teacher was like interrogating a new student.

Lihua was a little embarrassed by the female teacher's questions. She didn't know how to answer. At this moment, Liyun snatched the answer and said: "We are from Beijing, my sister——" Liyun had just said this when Lihua quietly pulled her, stopping her.

When the female teacher saw this situation, she didn't want to ask any further. She immediately took a basic book and gave it to Lihua, patting her and saying kindly:

"Take these books back and read them. If there is anything you don't understand, just ask me. Also, if you can understand the classes here, you can come here to audit every day, and we can waive the tuition fee."

"Thank you! I will definitely come to ask you for advice in the future!" Lihua said gratefully, gave a salute, and left with Liyun.

### Birthday Poem

— Xue Hua

The twenty-fifth day of the fifth lunar month is my birthday. Every year when this day comes, my friend Xuefang always sends me something. This year she sent a letter from the post office, with a blank piece of letter paper and a short poem inside, written like this:

——The same day the year before last,

I sent you a bright red rose,

Unexpectedly, as soon as you took it,

A small thorn broke your finger.

The same day last year,

I sent you a beautiful handkerchief,

Unexpectedly, as soon as you took it,

You put it to your eyes to wipe away tears.

The same day this year,

I decided to change my strategy,

I'll send you a blank piece of white paper,

I wonder if you can understand what I mean?——

After reading this poem several times, I picked up my pen and replied to Yunfang with the following poem:

——I understand what you mean:

Life is a blank piece of white paper.

I understand what you mean:

I can paint this white paper with splendid brocade,

I can also smear this white paper with stains.

Everything is up to my free will.

So I understand what you mean:

I should be careful with my free will!

I should cherish this blank paper of life!

International Knowledge

### Before 1960, the Soviet Union Did Not Dare to Wage War

Will there be a war between the United States and the Soviet Union in the near future? This is a question that the world cares about, but it seems that no one can answer. The American "Business Week" published an article by Paul Rensburg, a Dutchman, offering a bold answer to the above question. The main points are now excerpted and translated below, and those who are concerned about international politics can use it as a reference.

According to the Dutch opinion, the answer to this question can be seen from a series of concise figures put forward by Stalin. These figures illustrate the content of the Soviet Union's three five-year plans from now until 1960; they reveal what Stalin's purpose is.

Although many of the Soviet Union's five-year plans are entirely about the economy, they can also be seen as a barometer of Soviet political and military affairs. Modern warfare is ultimately built on economic strength. If factors such as morale and leadership are equal, the war is often won by the country with the largest industrial production capacity. Especially in the atomic age, a country's combat power cannot be judged solely by the number of its armed forces; the determining factor is still the function and scope of its technical system: its factories, scientists, workers, and raw materials.

The figures put forward by Stalin show that the Soviet Union is almost dwarfed in strength compared to the United States. Even if Stalin is determined to fight the United States, at least he can hope to do so before 1960.

His recent vows show that Stalin is well aware of the limits of Soviet power; the content of these speeches is more defensive than offensive. In order to ensure that the Soviet Union is not afraid of being attacked, it must be strong. At the same time, strength is a relative thing, so Stalin advocated that the first step for the Soviet industrial system should be to achieve this goal, which will take fifteen to twenty years.

For example, by 1960, the Soviet Union hopes to reach a steel production of 56 million tons per year, while the United States had a steel production of 80 million tons in 1945. The Soviet Union's steel production in 1940 was only 18 million tons.

Another sign of the Soviet Union's weakness is its limited pig iron production. Last year, the United States produced 54 million tons of pig iron, but the Soviet Union will only produce 50 million tons by 1960.

Oil production is another measure of a country's strength. In 1940, the Soviet Union produced 217 million barrels of oil, and by 1960, it hopes to increase this number to 420 million tons, but compared to the current production of the United States, it is only a quarter.

A country's industrial strength can also be judged from its transportation system. The Soviet Union's railway tracks are about 58,000 miles, many of which are single-track. The United States has more than 241,000 miles of railway tracks, more than four times that of the Soviet Union. As for roads that can be used in various climates, the Soviet Union has very few, while the United States has more than 3 million miles of main roads.

The Soviet Union hopes to produce 1 million cars per year by 1950, while by that time, American manufacturers can produce 6 million cars per year.

The purpose of this comparison is not to deny the progress of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's harvest is indeed great, but from the world's perspective, it is limited.

Stalin's plan particularly emphasizes four points, namely the Soviet Union's land, food, resources, and people. The Soviet Union's territory is three times larger than the United States, and although there is a temporary shortage of food, the hope of expanding agricultural production is almost unlimited. As for resources, the Soviet Union has sufficient reserves of almost every important mineral, and even if a few are insufficient, it has invented appropriate substitutes. In addition, the large population is also a factor that Stalin pays attention to.

Based on these points, Stalin believes that the Soviet Union can catch up with the United States, because according to Stalin's theory, American production will at most remain the same or even become depressed in the next 20 years due to the constraints of capitalism.

But the Soviet Union is very unwilling for the United States to experience a recession. This is not because Stalin has any preference for the United States, but for another reason. Because once the United States encounters economic difficulties, it may engage in arms production to seek a way out; this is an emergency measure to remedy the situation, and in this way, there is a danger of forcing other countries to implement an arms race.

Of course, the Soviet Union's leaders hope that the Soviet Union will grow, but at the same time, they also hope that the United States will not encounter difficulties and remain strong. The Soviet Union believes that the industrial equality between the United States and the Soviet Union is a plan to build a peaceful world.

Therefore, the Dutchman's conclusion seems to be that before 1960, when the Soviet Union has not caught up with the United States in industry, it will not dare to rashly start a war.

### The Soviet Union's Diplomatic Magic Weapon: The Veto, Repeatedly Used in the Security Council, Leaving British and American Representatives Helpless

— Edited by Jianan

### "Veto" Expert Gromyko

The "veto" issue of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council is indeed a very delicate topic. Many people think that it is enough to hinder the Security Council from taking effective action, and some think that it is a guarantee that can prevent a country's主張 from being erased by other countries. In fact, the "veto" can be regarded as a barometer of whether international cooperation is sincere. The less it is used, the more it can show that the cooperation between countries is free from question. Of course, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to abolish the "veto" for a while. We can only hope that time will dilute it and make it disappear invisibly.

Up to now, the Soviet Union has used the "veto" the most times.

The Soviet Union encountered reefs in the Security Council, and it used this power. The whole world is already accustomed to this. In order to counter the majority of democratic countries, the Soviet Union used the "veto" to protect itself. But if the United Nations must bow to a minority of countries on every issue, it simply cannot work.

A year ago, at the San Francisco Conference, the Soviet Union finally agreed with other major powers that the use of the "veto" should be limited to taking punitive actions against countries, and should not be used for minor issues such as procedural matters. The Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China jointly declared: "We cannot assume that the permanent members of the Security Council will deliberately use the "veto" to obstruct its actions." But within five months, the Soviet Union used the "veto" twice to oppose resolutions for peaceful settlement, and also had the intention to use the "veto" for non-punitive issues.

We now list the number of times the Soviet Union has used the "veto" below:

(1) In January of this year, Canadian Pannier's failure to be elected as Secretary-General of the Security Council was due to the Soviet Union's opposition and the threat of using the "veto."

(2) In February, the Soviet Union vetoed the resolution of confidence on the withdrawal of British and French troops from Syria and Lebanon. (At present, all troops have withdrawn from Syria, and almost all troops stationed in Lebanon have also withdrawn).

(3) In March, Soviet representative Gromyko walked away because he could not convince other members of the Security Council that the resolution to listen to the report of Iranian Ambassador Elara was also within the scope of the "veto."

(4) In April, Gromyko refused to vote on the proposal to establish a subcommittee to investigate Franco Spain, with no other intention than to show that he had the "veto" in hand, although he did not use it.

(5) In late June, Gromyko opposed the resolution on Spain, mainly because the Soviet Union opposed submitting this issue to the United Nations General Assembly.

The next day, the Soviet Union insisted on maintaining the "veto" in the control of atomic energy, opposing the United States' view of abolishing it. In the United States' view, if any country has the "veto," the world cannot effectively control atomic energy, but Gromyko said, "In any case, the "veto" should be maintained."

The "veto" is a passive thing, not an active tool. Its appearance shows that there are still gaps between countries, and the effectiveness of the United Nations cannot be fully发挥. We might as well say: "The more times the veto is used, the farther away from the ideals of the United Nations." But if international justice can become more and more obvious, the shadow of the "veto" will be broken by the light.

### How the Atomic Bomb Was Dropped

— Translated by Junmo from Saturday Evening Post

Colonel Tibbets, who piloted the Superfortress flying at 30,000 feet and dropped the historic first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, personally narrated this dramatic and moving story.

At the vast airfield in Utah, B29 Superfortresses were flying at altitudes invisible to the naked eye. The secret 509th Composite Group was training there. Pilots practiced sharp turns, return flights, and precise bombing. The airmen of the 509th were trained in atomic bombing, but did not know that there was such a thing as an atomic bomb. They only heard it said: "What we learn at the Utah airfield may end the war." They believed it and obeyed the command.

Until August 1944, I didn't know about the atomic bomb. Then, I received a strange letter from my father from Miami, asking: "How are you doing? Some special people have come to investigate your situation. Have you done anything wrong?"

Less than a week later, I was summoned to see General Ant, the commander of the Second Air Force. An army intelligence officer pulled me aside and asked me a question. This was the final test of my loyalty to the motherland. I passed, and then they told me about the atomic bomb.

Our training was completely secret. When a 509th aircraft took off, no one knew where it was going. Sometimes we dropped simulated atomic bombs in the sea, and sometimes we sent an aircraft to Japan to drop a bomb to test the accuracy of bombing.

By noon on August 15, everything was ready. The atomic bomb was ready, the aircraft had been fueled, and the crews had been tested. The takeoff time was set for 2:30 a.m.

I wanted to take a nap, but couldn't sleep. At one o'clock, we ate ham and eggs. At 1:30, three aircraft took off to Japan to scout the weather conditions over the target.

The atomic bomb was placed in my aircraft. My co-pilot was Bob Lewis, navigator Van Kirk, and bombardier Ferebee. Two B29s accompanied us. One tested the force of the explosion, and the other took pictures. At 2:15, we started the engines. I forgot about the atomic bomb and concentrated on checking the instruments.

Bob Lewis was calculating the time. Fifteen seconds, ten seconds, five seconds, ready——

At 2:30 a.m. sharp, the aircraft left the ground and flew to Japan, unfolding this new era of the atomic bomb.

After climbing to a considerable altitude, I drank some coffee, turned around, and told my companions what a guy was in the bomb bay. They listened, understood, and remained calm. An atomic bomb, good.

At 8:15, we received the weather report from the patrol aircraft on the radio: visibility over Hiroshima was ten miles, with a slight haze. We continued to climb, and the three B29s formed a loose formation.

Twenty-five miles from Hiroshima, we began to use radar to control the aircraft. The altimeter was pointing at 31,600 feet, and we would drop the bomb at 9:15 according to the planned schedule.

Twelve miles from the target, Ferebee shouted, "I see it!"

He grabbed the bomb sight and took over the control stick from me. A loud warning was issued on the radio, notifying the B29s protecting us that the bomb would be dropped in two minutes. Ferebee nodded to me, everything was fine. He made a gesture to the radio operator, and a continuous sound was emitted on the radio, telling each aircraft, "Bomb release in fifteen seconds."

The sound on the radio stopped, and the bomb was released. Ferebee left the bomb sight. I released the autopilot and turned the aircraft sharply.

I pulled up the welding glass. Suddenly, I couldn't see anything, I was completely blind. I dropped my glasses on the ground.

A dazzling light filled the aircraft, and the first violent blast wave hit us. We were already eleven and a half miles away from the explosion site, but the entire aircraft was shaking violently. I shouted, thinking that the aircraft had been hit by anti-aircraft fire.

The machine gunner in the rear compartment had seen the first blast wave coming, but he didn't know what it was. When the second blast wave came, he issued a warning.

We turned back and looked down at Hiroshima. The entire city was in flames, and columns of fire rose to an unbelievable height. Everyone has seen these photos now.

Everyone was silent for a while, and then everyone was talking. I remember Lewis swinging my arm and saying, "Look! Look!" He said that he could taste the taste of the atomic bomb explosion on his tongue, which was the same as the taste of lead.

Ferebee issued a report on the way back, "The result is excellent."

"Hey, what do you say?" He asked me, "It's really great."

When we landed, we heard someone shout, "Attention!" General Spaatz stepped forward and pinned a DSC medal on my lapel.

A relative told me that he recently wanted to take the No. 1 tram, which was no different from waiting for a hare to run into a tree stump. Once was on June 23rd, with wind, from 9:00 p.m. to 9:50 p.m., waiting for the eastbound No. 1 tram at the Nanjing Road Zhejiang Road station, watching several No. 2 trams pass by, but not seeing a single No. 1 tram. Once was on the 13th of this month from 4:55 p.m. to 5:25 p.m., waiting for the same No. 1 tram at the same station. The eastbound No. 2 trams reached 24, but not a single No. 1 tram was seen. Even the westbound trams, there were no less than 20 No. 2 trams, while only 2 No. 1 trams passed by in total. Another time, he saw an interesting fact. On the 14th of this month at 10:00 p.m., he passed through North Sichuan Road on his way home, and from the Changchun Road intersection south to the terminal station in front of Fuxing Middle Road, he counted as many as seven northbound No. 1 trams parked there.

We believe that trams are also a public utility, and the purpose is to facilitate the general public who cannot afford to prepare their own rickshaws, tricycles, or even cars. Judging from the above facts, the No. 1 tram from Jing'an Temple to the end of North Sichuan Road is really a bit of a headache for passengers.

Of course, we dare not believe that the tram company deliberately treats this most crowded route in the city harshly. But first, if it is said that there was wind on the night of June 23rd, the No. 2 trams were still running as usual; second, if it is said that there are not enough vehicles to distribute, so that not a single No. 1 tram departs for half an hour or fifty minutes, then how could the No. 2 trams have departed for 20 vehicles in half an hour? Third, as many as seven vehicles are parked at the terminal station at the same time. I wonder if the starting station has the same situation. Is it because the terminal station of the No. 2 tram is in public view, so it does not dare to have such a strange phenomenon of parking seven vehicles in a row?

Speaking of it, it is another trivial matter, but the time of the common people is also time. This article is respectfully submitted to the public utility authorities.

### Using Domestic Goods Is the Most Glorious

— Yang Mou

When imported goods fill every corner, our industry has to send out a cry for help for the sake of its fragile lifeblood. Everyone cannot but feel deep sympathy for the unfortunate fate that our industry is currently encountering.

Using one more domestic good is leaving one more vitality for ourselves.

Even if you put on glass clothes, and everything becomes glassized, you still cannot improve your own value and status. Always dragging behind others, using atomic something on this side, and Pol type something on that side, at best, it is just a mere echo.

Everyone using Chinese goods can help Chinese industry overcome difficulties and enter the bright road.

Many foreign goods are smuggled past our customs. But our industry, in addition to coping with high-priced raw materials and labor, also has to bear huge government taxes. This spirit is so admirable.

Loving to use domestic goods is by no means being xenophobic. On the contrary, we very much hope for the import of foreign goods, but what we hope to import are machines and raw materials, so that our industry can also develop day by day.

Admittedly, foreign goods are cheaper than domestic goods, but frugality can help you solve this problem.

Don't ignore it because it is small. Everyone uniting with one heart will perhaps save everyone from buying one less box of shoe polish, which is enough to open a shoe polish factory.

Today, foreign countries are already in the atomic age, and we are far behind. But just chasing after others, eating foreign instant noodles, foreign canned goods, foreign oranges, wearing foreign clothing, foreign suits, and using foreign cosmetics, this is still a great shame. If everyone uses their own products, even if they are crude, they are still worth glory and respect.

We are the victorious country, and the huge sacrifice has earned this glory. But the lessons of the past year can alert everyone, otherwise, how long this glory can be preserved is really a fiery question.

Everyone calmly think about it, use domestic goods or foreign goods?

Using domestic goods is the most glorious!

### Talking About Confusion

— Hua Ke

"Not crazy, not family head." Some people, some things, take confusion as the best policy. "Hard to be confused," how precious is "confusion."

Putting everything down a little, bringing more of a "Han doesn't care" indifferent atmosphere, throughout the ages, many people have often praised the confused as having "the demeanor of a gentleman" and "the belly of a prime minister."

In essence, many lucky people in society are sophisticated, long-sleeved, good at dancing, and round and round characters. So soft that you can't pinch out bones, and the knee joints are especially flexible, able to bend and stretch very softly. If people are too soft, although they can gain experience, they can hide their edge, but after all, they lack a bit of backbone, a bit of a spirit that is inviolable, and gradually become "confused" due to following the old ways.

In China, "not being confused about big things" seems to be a brilliant virtue. But in reality, it's okay to be a little confused about small things. So foreign scientists spend their whole lives calculating, and our statistics only show a general situation. In fact, people have been doing their best to study molecules, atoms, electrons, ... Could our world still be a world that is "undifferentiated chaos"?

In reality, big things are not necessarily not confused, because under the style of "turning big things into small things, and small things into nothing," even the biggest things can pass by easily, with calm winds and waves, in exchange for a result of "pure quietude and non-action."

"Great wisdom appears foolish, great skill appears clumsy," no wonder many smart people are learning to be confused, pretending to be "seeing but not seeing, hearing but not hearing"!

In this way, some people say that "confusion" is cleverness, and it is a benefit, but what is questionable is: is a "person" who is "living like a corpse with leftover breath" still a "person"? Is it still the "spirit of all things"?

### Professors Should Not Change Careers

— Ma Chaochang

Reading the report in the 14th newspaper that university professors are changing careers and opening dance schools, after reading it, I spontaneously produced infinite thoughts.

Now I know that a certain professor of literature at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou has abandoned his teaching career and opened a dance school because of "making a living." Whether this move is normal, I will not discuss it for the time being. But thinking of several professors in our school, they also started to abandon teaching and take up other jobs this summer. The purpose is also to maintain their lives. Under this situation, seeing the professors leaving their posts and going to other paths, is this a blessing or a misfortune for society? I think at least it is losing an ideal leader for the youth, and at least it is losing a talent who cultivates talents for the country. In the current process of building the country, of course talent is the first. Without talent, there is no way to build the country. Since we know that talent is important, then how can we let the talents who cultivate talents leave their posts? I see that the professors in the current universities are already lacking, especially the famous professors are even fewer. Under this situation, if we do not set up a strategy to retain the positions of the professors, then the future of China's university education will be unimaginable.

I remember that university professors went on strike last semester, and now I see that university professors are changing careers. "Going on strike" is their active way to struggle for a living, and "changing careers" is their passive way to improve their lives. But we should know that the active can be supplemented, while the passive is not reliable, so we cannot casually ignore the change of careers of university professors. At the same time, I dare say that the change of careers of university professors is exactly the harbinger of the impending crisis in Chinese education.

### Free Port

— Yu Lin

The Hong Kong authorities have announced a ban on the import of fabrics, silks, and woolens starting July 1st. Of course, this measure carries extraordinary significance and is definitely not aimed at saving the sales of local manufacturers' products. In fact, this ban is because, given the current situation, British goods in Hong Kong are likely to be unable to withstand the competition from American goods. Hong Kong is currently under British rule, and in order to maintain the inherent position of British goods in the Hong Kong market, the authorities have issued this import restriction order. The free port is no longer free.

American silks, fabrics, woolens, and daily necessities are currently being dumped into cities around the world, threatening business communities in all countries. Because of the current shortage of materials in our country, it seems that we need foreign goods to help us out. This kind of emergency relief is necessary, but it would be unwise to rely on foreign goods for a long time to maintain the domestic market. The supply of materials in a place like Hong Kong is not necessarily more abundant than in Shanghai. However, for their own benefit, the British authorities have first issued a ban on the import of silks, fabrics, and woolens. I think this ban may affect other imported goods in the future.

Currently, various foreign goods manufacturers in Shanghai are already feeling seriously threatened by the dumping of American goods. If everyone doesn't think of a way to save the situation, then the future of domestic goods will be unimaginable. However, our country is caught in the midst of national affairs, and it is difficult to solve political and military problems, making it even more difficult to find a solution to economic difficulties for the time being. What we can do is probably still support domestic goods.

### Municipal Government Building

— Gan Zi

I walked around the Municipal Government building and felt that this building was constructed very solidly. This solidity seems to have exceeded the limits of residential solidity. Someone with some military knowledge said: If sandbags are piled up at a few entrances of this building, it would be a very good fortress; there is a plaza inside where tanks can move in and out; and the location is close to the Huangpu River, making supply and communication very convenient. This building used to be the Public Works Department of the former British Concession, showing how far-sighted the British were in the first place.

### Heard in the Park

— Xiao Shi

In Gujiazhai Garden, I heard the following words:

"I have been working here since the French ran this park. The wages used to be forty-eight yuan, which could buy five dan of rice. Now it is seventy-two thousand yuan, and it is not easy to buy even one dan of rice."

"The French were very serious about park management and had a fixed budget. Once the budget was decided, there were no changes. The money under the budget items was all used for park management, so the park was well managed. We used to be very efficient and had good results. But the current situation is completely different. There is no money for park repairs. Even if it is severely dilapidated and requires a single nail, it is necessary to submit an official request, which must be reviewed by three or four reviewing agencies. The time is so long that you will forget about it, but the result is often not easy to achieve. For example, the official request in March is still unknown."

"Park tickets should not be sold in theory. All countries in the world and ports in China do not buy tickets. The reason for buying tickets here is to limit the number of tourists? Those who enter the park can also be neater. This is also a convenient method, which is not impossible. However, the ticket revenue should be used entirely for the park's own operations. (Now it is handed over to the Finance Bureau as the city's recurring expenses.) Moreover, there are too many things to be done in the park, and nothing can be done without money. Now we are often scolded for not doing things well. In fact, a clever woman cannot cook a meal without rice, and it is thankless to perform while holding a stone mortar. It is really unjust and wronged."

"During a certain period (the enemy-puppet era), the person in charge of park management not only did not make any improvements to the park, but also told us to move the better flowers, trees, and chairs in the park to their private residences, and often asked two or three workers to weed and work in their private residences. They were our superiors, how could we not obey orders?"

"We are not flattering foreigners and insisting that the French are good. This is a fact. We always hope that after the Chinese manage it themselves, the results will be better than theirs."

Anyone who has recently visited the park can confirm that the above remarks are not wrong. Indeed, there are fewer chairs than before, and it is very difficult to find a chair when entering the park. Moreover, some of the chairs have long been broken beyond repair. There are not many exotic flowers and plants, and there are no new arrangements. More than thirty workers are only doing weeding and sweeping.

### Humorous Miscellany

— Yun Kan

Someone named Wang was arrested and brought before the county magistrate for the crime of "receiving ill-gotten wealth"!

The county magistrate asked him, "Have you ever received 'legitimate' money?"

Wang replied, "Yes, only once, when your honor was elected as a senator last year, your honor rewarded me with five thousand yuan, a towel, and a bar of soap."

Mr. Lin said to one of his neighbors, "I heard that your son has returned from overseas!"

That neighbor replied:

"No, not returned from overseas, but from under the sea—don't you know he serves on a submarine?"

### Don't Make a Fortune Illegally

— You Fu

The newspaper on the 9th carried a news item in a prominent position: "Poor Teacher Makes a Fortune Illegally by Embezzling 200 Million Yuan in Public Funds." After reading it, I was very surprised, sympathetic, and finally let out a long sigh. I never thought that someone who makes a living with pen and ink would do such a thing. It's truly "prices rise, and personality declines."

However, after thinking about it, I feel that this matter is not simple. In addition to this personal criminal act, it is accompanied by a serious problem in society. A poor teacher has limited income and cannot support his family. Therefore, he will think of many "making a fortune illegally" ideas. I think that a person who entrusts his career to education is mostly enthusiastic about serving the people. If he can live a decent life, he will definitely be content and will not cause such unfortunate things to happen in society.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, "military affairs were first," but in the post-war nation-building cause, "education is first." Therefore, I hope that government authorities and social elites will pay more attention to and improve the treatment of teachers. It is not enough to rely solely on one or two teacher appreciation campaigns to make up for it. That is not a fundamental solution.

But I bring the topic back again. People, despite being "poor," must be "poor" with ambition. Moreover, most intellectuals are "poor," but intellectuals are "pioneers" whose reason and insights are higher than ordinary people. Therefore, they should not be spineless, and I believe that most are not. They don't want to make any money and prefer to live a simple life. This is also the spirit of the excellent tradition of intellectuals. This spirit still exists.

Now, after seeing this news, we cannot help but regret that such a scum has emerged among intellectuals. We must know that although everyone loves "money," we must not risk making a fortune illegally, because this can lead to "one wrong step bringing eternal regret," and we will never be able to wash away our stains, harming us for life. Not only will we face lawsuits, but also our career and future will be lost. Here I sincerely advise everyone, "Don't make a fortune illegally!"

### Sent to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (9)

— Zhou Shoujuan

Since you passed away, this home seems to have become a soulless place, and I seem to have become a soulless person. All day long, I wander around the garden like a walking corpse, reminiscing about the past, and getting some sweet memories. I remember that the eighth day of the first lunar month thirty years ago was the auspicious day of our wedding, which opened the door of happiness for me. Since then, starting a family and establishing a career have been entirely thanks to your assistance. Before the wedding, I already had someone in mind, but because she had been betrothed to someone else since childhood, the good thing did not work out. Both of us were timid children, succumbing to the clutches of the old etiquette and dare not act rashly. Although we had been corresponding for three years, we had never met or spoken a word. When she was forced to throw herself into someone else's arms, I was very distressed. A year later, my mother saw that I was too pitiful and persuaded me to choose a good marriage. I thought of you, whom I often met at my cousin Kan's house. Through my cousin, they entrusted a neighbor to propose marriage to your family. Your father immediately gave his consent, and married his only daughter to me, because at that time, the "Saturday" Weekly was popular, and he already knew my name. On the third day after you entered the door, I told you the whole story of that emotional public case without any concealment, and showed you her picture. Although you were a little unhappy, you also tried to tolerate it and only said to me, "The future is still long, as long as you are worthy of me." For thirty years, although I am still trapped in my own cocoon and cannot forget her, I respect you and love you, always as one. This is what you cannot deny, right? In the years that followed, we sometimes inevitably had some disputes over this matter, but we always tolerated and understood each other, and the emotions were quickly put away, without damaging our deep-rooted feelings. I remember that in my poems, there were these two poems: "The thread of love is on the body when I am young, it is difficult to brandish a sword and ten thousand threads are confusing; I have two hearts in two rooms, she occupies the first, and the second belongs to you." "Often feigning a slight anger, and often making cold remarks with subtle words; please understand that the past lingers in my heart, we are both people sharing the same quilt." I told you the meaning of the poems, and you were not offended, but only said that I was a fool. Yes! I am a fool in the arena of love, a fool for you, a fool for her, and this goes on in parallel until now.

A year after the marriage, you gave birth to Zheng'er for me. Unfortunately, you encountered a difficult delivery and were almost delayed by the midwife. We rushed to ask an obstetrician to perform surgery to deliver the baby. Fortunately, both mother and child were safe. However, the assistant was in a rush and accidentally spilled the chloroform on your face, causing swelling and ulceration, and it took more than a month to recover. When you were groaning and tossing, I saw you suffering great pain and fainted in a hurry. Less than ten days after giving birth, you got up to take care of the housework, and you were also breastfeeding yourself. It was extremely hard, but due to economic constraints, I had to trouble you. I remember that I later had three more poems "Teasing People," which were written for this purpose: "Seventeen-year-old Chang Jun, with a red thread and light powder; coming to the lip of the house to be a wife, don't sweep the eyebrows, sweep the steps." "In the past, I was timid and afraid of the empty room, but today I am suddenly a mother; after Lantian gave birth to jade, Tan slaves do not love children." "Household trivial matters are self-calculated, and the well and mortar are busy all day long; let's wait for the golden wedding flower candle night, why not let you be the groom?" When you heard the last one, you couldn't help but laugh and said, "You thought of it; if you want me to be the groom, you have to reincarnate!"

Over seventeen years, you gave birth to three sons and four daughters, a total of seven children. Originally, my mother and I were a desolate and lonely family, but thanks to your strength, it became a prosperous and respectable family. Fortunately, my economic situation gradually improved, so except for the second daughter, Ling, who was still breastfed by you, the other five hired wet nurses. Although it reduced some of your labor, you were still very busy. Although there were mothers and Granny Ye and Granny Wang who could help, you had to ask about everything, big and small; at the same time, you had to take the time to serve me, paying attention to everything I ate and wore; although my income has increased, you still refuse to waste a penny. Your spirit of diligence, thrift, hard work and endurance is truly great.
