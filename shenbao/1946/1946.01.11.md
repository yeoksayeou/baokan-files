### Jointly Discussing Plans for Peaceful Nation-Building: Opening Ceremony of the Consultative Conference Successfully Concluded

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] After leading the nation's military and civilians to victory in the War of Resistance against Japan, the National Government, in order to achieve peaceful nation-building and implement constitutional government, convened a Political Consultative Conference of representatives from various parties and prominent social figures to jointly deliberate on national affairs. Amidst the expectations of the people nationwide, the conference opened at 10:00 AM on the 10th in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting. Members present included Chen Qitian, Chang Naiyi, Yu Jiaju, Wang Yunwu, Shao Lizi, Guo Moruo, Miao Jiaming, Fu Sinian, Zeng Qi, Yang Yongjun, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Sun Ke, Zhang Lisheng, Qian Yongming, Chen Lifu, Li Zhuchen, Wang Ruofei, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yuzhang, Ye Jianying, Dong Biwu, Chen Bulei, Hu Lin, Lu Dingyi, Zhang Lan, Shen Junru, Shao Congen, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, Zhou Enlai, and Zhang Qun, totaling thirty-six people. Mo Dehui and Zhang Junmai, two members, were absent due to not having returned to Chongqing. The venue was arranged simply and neatly. In front of the stage, the members' seating area was in five rows, with seats arranged according to the list published by the government. The press seating area was in four rows, at the rear. When the Chairman arrived, all members stood at attention, and the Chairman smiled and nodded in acknowledgement. Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the number of attendees, after which the Chairman announced the opening of the meeting, reverently read the Last Will and Testament of the Founding Father of the Republic, and first announced that a method for stopping military conflicts had been agreed upon, and that orders to cease conflict would be issued immediately, to which the meeting hall responded with unanimous applause. He then continued with his opening address, pointing out the purpose of convening the Political Consultative Conference and his opinions on the conference, which were to gather ideas widely and jointly discuss the basic plan for peaceful nation-building and to promote the implementation of constitutional government. He hoped that all members would be sincere and candid, impartial and selfless, far-sighted, and prioritize the nation in all matters. He also wished the conference success. Finally, he announced the government's decision to implement certain measures. After the speech, Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, Zeng Qi, representative of the Youth Party, Shen Junru, representative of the Democratic League, and Shao Congen, representative of non-party and non-factional individuals, delivered speeches. (The texts of the speeches will be published tomorrow.) Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported that the meeting would continue at 3:00 PM tomorrow. At 11:30 AM, the Chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting.

[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 10th] The English name of the Political Consultative Conference is (Political Conference). As the name suggests, it is of a consultative nature. The opening ceremony this morning was extremely simple, but the arrangement of the venue was very solemn. The representatives were seated in the front, followed by special guests and the press. Restrictions on guests were very strict, and the press received special treatment. Foreign reporters who understood Chinese included Varaw, Macaleauy, and Chebykin.

### Chairman Chiang's Earnest Address: Hopes for National Unity to Overcome All Difficulties in Pursuit of Stability, Strengthening Power to Accelerate Nation-Building

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Chairman Chiang attended the Political Consultative Conference on the morning of the 10th and delivered an opening address. Before the address, he first said that he was very pleased to announce to everyone that a method for stopping conflicts had been agreed upon and that orders to cease conflict would be issued immediately. (Applause) He then read the opening address, the full text of which is as follows:

Gentlemen, today marks the opening of the Political Consultative Conference. On behalf of the National Government, I extend a sincere welcome to all of you. At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal expectations for the conference. As for the government's policy, I have already explained it in detail in my New Year's Day broadcast address, so I will not repeat it.

More than half of the members present today have participated in previous sessions of the National Political Council. Therefore, I naturally think of the achievements of the National Political Council. The National Political Council is now in its fourth session, and the proportion of elected members has gradually increased. Elected members now account for two-thirds of the total. The National Political Council has made numerous contributions to the country, but the most important one is the unanimous support for the national policy of resistance to the end. Although the members of the National Political Council have different political stances and opinions, their stance on the fundamental plan concerning the safety and survival of the nation and the people has been entirely consistent from beginning to end. This is a major force that has enabled us to persevere in the war of resistance and secure victory. Now that our war of resistance has come to a victorious end, our mission in this world war, like that of other United Nations, is to win victory and to win peace. Winning peace, generally speaking, means to firmly maintain the fruits of victory, establish a world order of peace, and eliminate the root causes of aggression and war forever. For China, in particular, it is especially important to immediately follow the victory of the War of Resistance with a united national effort to overcome all difficulties in order to seek domestic order and stability and to carry out the work of nation-building.

Concentrating Power to Begin Nation-Building

The purpose of convening this conference is to invite representatives from various parties and prominent social figures to jointly deliberate on national affairs. What we want to discuss is the basic plan for the country to transition from wartime to peacetime, from resistance to nation-building, that is, how to concentrate all forces and strengthen all forces to begin the work of nation-building. We have endured eight years of bitter fighting, with those who died sacrificing for the country and those who lived enduring great suffering. Our sole purpose was to ensure the survival of the nation and to remove obstacles to nation-building in order to obtain this good opportunity for revitalization and construction. Now that the War of Resistance has ended victoriously, the work of nation-building should begin immediately. It is universally recognized throughout the country that China must implement the Three Principles of the People. It is also the hope of the world that China must become a unified, democratic, and strong nation. Therefore, on the one hand, we must strive to promote the timely convening of the National Assembly and the early implementation of democratic constitutionalism. At the same time, before the National Assembly is convened, we must gather ideas widely and pool our efforts to eliminate all factors that could hinder unity of will, affect order and stability, and delay revitalization and construction, in order to strengthen our nation-building power and accelerate our nation-building progress. This is the aim of the government in convening this conference, and this is the mission and task of this conference.

Strengthening the Rule of Law to Establish a Constitutional Foundation

In the past, because we were engaged in a life-and-death war of resistance, all arrangements and laws focused on adapting to military requirements. After the end of the War of Resistance, our work should prioritize "post-war recovery first, construction first." Many wartime laws have been gradually abolished or amended. In the future, all political and social arrangements should be brought back to normal as much as possible, and the spirit of the rule of law should be strengthened to establish a constitutional foundation. The gentlemen participating in this conference must feel the same way about this point. If you have any opinions, I hope you will express them as much as possible. The government is willing to consider and adopt them. However, we must pay attention to the real situation of the country and society and ensure that no difficulties or turmoil occur during the transition period, and that the foundation of the country is not shaken, so as to smoothly promote constitutionalism and enable the work of nation-building to proceed smoothly.

People's Demands: Stability, Revival, and Unity

Although this conference is not elected by the people, all of you are enthusiastic about national affairs and concerned about the people's livelihood. You will certainly be able to understand the people's true hopes and wishes and recognize their urgent demands. The Founding Father of the Republic said, "The foundation of a country lies in its people." Therefore, the people's demands must be consistent with the needs of the country. According to my observation, the people's most urgent demands today are for stability, for revival, and for the country's unified progress and prosperity, in order to improve their lives. At a minimum, they also demand that their lives be guaranteed, that they can live and work in peace, and that their freedom is not violated. Of course, the government must be responsible and fulfill its duties to meet the people's wishes, relieve their suffering, and protect their freedom. At the same time, what this conference needs to fully discuss should also be based on these most urgent demands to determine our current national policy. China must realize democracy. This is the consistent goal of our national revolution and the purpose of this arduous War of Resistance. However, before the National Assembly is convened and constitutionalism is implemented, there is no way for the people's true will to be fully expressed. Our responsibility is very heavy. The government convenes this conference with only a sense of responsibility and obligation and has no selfish or self-interested considerations. The government will sincerely accept any decision made by this conference as long as it is beneficial to the country's construction, beneficial to the people's happiness, and helpful to the advancement of democracy. At the same time, on the day the conference begins, I would like to offer the following points:

Sincerity and Candor: Establishing a Democratic Model

First, be sincere and candid and establish a democratic model. This conference is certainly not a conference for various parties to solve their own problems, but a conference for jointly laying the foundation for nation-building. Our views on national affairs and our political positions cannot be absolutely the same, and may even be very different. However, I hope that all of you, under the common understanding of consolidating the foundation of the country, can fully and candidly express your views without any concealment or reservation. We can take this opportunity for heated discussion to discover common ground from different perspectives and to enhance our spirit of cooperation through mutual understanding. Only with candor can we see sincerity, and only by sacrificing prejudices and choosing what is good can we make rational and beneficial resolutions. We should actively advocate what should be advocated, and we should not hesitate to concede what should be conceded. We want to use this as a test of democratic spirit, and we want to use this as the beginning of cultivating a democratic demeanor. We hope that this conference can maintain understanding and harmony throughout, and we do not want any interruptions or setbacks.

Impartiality and Selflessness: Considering the Interests of the Country

Second, be impartial and selfless and consider the interests of the country. Our understanding and concessions have a common goal, which is to prioritize the interests of the nation and the people and to put the gains and losses of parties or individuals second. Before the overall interests of the nation and the people, all prejudices of parties or individuals should be sacrificed and conceded. To make effective resolutions, sometimes withdrawing our proposals is of greater value than insisting on our positions. Only in this way can we see our loyalty to the country, and only in this way can this conference achieve substantial results.

Farsightedness: Facing the Future of the Country

Third, be farsighted and face the future of the country. In the middle of holding the conference, there are three things that everyone should keep in mind: (1) the heroism of the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed during the War of Resistance, (2) the urgency of our compatriots who are displaced and suffering and longing for relief, and (3) the depth of the past suffering of our country and the unpredictability of the safety and well-being of the nation's future. Therefore, this conference is to concentrate power and must not disperse power. It is to create unity and must not destroy unity. It is to support the government and strengthen the government and not to weaken the government. It is to open up the future of nation-building and promote the progress of our country, and it must not allow the country to stagnate in a state of backwardness, or even cause the country to regress. As long as we can recognize these key points, our country can embark on the road of democratic construction and be respected by the friendly countries of the world. Gentlemen, I have full confidence in this conference. I deeply feel that the sincere cooperation of our past National Political Council has won the victory in the War of Resistance. Therefore, I am equally convinced that the achievements of this conference will promote the work of nation-building, maintain the fruits of victory, and win peace. World public opinion and the people's earnest prayers are focused on this Political Consultative Conference. I respectfully pray for the success of this conference with great sincerity. The speech ends here.

Guaranteeing Freedom and Recognizing the Status of Political Parties

The Chairman then announced that he would take this opportunity to announce the matters that the government has decided to implement.

"The Freedom of the People" The people enjoy freedom of person, belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association. Existing laws and regulations will be abolished or amended accordingly. Agencies other than the judiciary and the police shall not arrest, interrogate, or punish the people.

"The Legal Status of Political Parties" All political parties are equal before the law and may conduct public activities within the scope of the law.

"Universal Suffrage" All localities will actively promote local self-government and implement universal suffrage from the bottom up in accordance with the law.

"Release of Political Prisoners" Political prisoners, except for traitors and those who have committed acts that endanger the Republic of China, will be released separately.

### Ceasefire Order Issued, Executive Headquarters Established, Inspection Team Organized

[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] National Government representative Zhang Qun and Chinese Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai, after consulting Chairman Chiang and Mao Zedong respectively and obtaining their approval, issued the following ceasefire order to all troops:

The National Army's regular army, volunteer army, irregular army, and guerrillas, and the Chinese Communist Army's troops, shall execute the following orders:

(1) Immediately cease all conflicts. (2) Except for certain specific areas, all troop movements within the country shall cease. However, movements for demobilization, reorganization, supply, management, and local security are permitted. (3) Cease destroying or obstructing all lines of communication. All troops shall immediately remove all obstacles to the lines of communication. (4) Immediately establish an Executive Headquarters in Beiping to implement the ceasefire agreement. The headquarters will include three members, one representing the government, one representing the Communist Party, and one representing the United States.

All necessary instructions and orders unanimously agreed upon by the three members will be issued by the Executive Headquarters in the name of the Chairman of the National Government.

We have reached the following oral agreement regarding the above ceasefire order: (1) The ceasefire order does not affect military operations in the Jiangnan region, so that the National Army can continue to implement its troop reorganization plan. (2) The ceasefire order does not affect the military operations of the National Army entering or within Northeast China. (3) The lines of communication referred to in the ceasefire order include postal communication. (4) The National Army troops moving in accordance with the aforementioned oral agreement must report to the Executive Headquarters daily.

The Executive Headquarters' agreements, recommendations, and directives will only address urgent issues arising from the ceasefire. The sole objective of the United States' participation in the headquarters is to assist the Chinese members in implementing the ceasefire order. The Executive Headquarters will include working groups composed of officers and soldiers to investigate the details on the ground.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] According to military sources, after the government representatives and the Chinese Communist Party representatives agreed on methods for stopping conflicts and restoring communication, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, all field headquarters, pacification headquarters, war zones, front armies, garrison commanders, guard commanders, army groups, provincial chairmen, and army commanders on the 10th, instructing them to strictly comply.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Government representatives Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi, and Chinese Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Wang Ruofei, and Ye Jianying, after several discussions and exchanges of views on the issue of stopping military conflicts and restoring communication, reached a unanimous agreement on January 5. Now that the ceasefire order has been issued, the full text is hereby published as follows: Regarding the method of stopping domestic military conflicts, it is now agreed as follows: (1) Stop all military conflicts in all parts of the country and restore all communication. The orders for stopping conflicts and restoring communication shall be in accordance with the second provision. (2) All domestic military conflicts and communication blockades are related to our country's obligations to the Allied nations regarding the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners. Therefore, the government and the Chinese Communist Party should each send a representative to consult with General Marshall as soon as possible, submit a plan to the government for implementation. (3) The resident members of the National Political Council and the Political Consultative Conference shall each appoint eight impartial individuals other than those involved in the Nationalists and Communists to form a military inspection team to go to the conflict areas with both the Nationalists and Communists to investigate the military situation, communication conditions, and other matters related to domestic peace restoration. They shall submit and publish reports on the true facts at any time.

### Young Girl Supporting Zhang Lan, Reporters Provided with Cigarettes and Tea

[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 10th] (1) The Chairman entered the venue at 10:15 AM, wearing a khaki Zhongshan suit, and sat in the first leather chair on the right side after his address. (2) The government and CCP representatives sat on the right side, the Democratic League and non-party members on the left, and 38 press seats were behind them. (3) Chen Qitian of the Youth Party was the first to arrive. (4) Zhang Lan was supported by a young girl, Shao Congen had a patch of white hair and a peaceful demeanor.

(7) Lei Zhen asked Shao Lizi how the arrangement was, and he replied: Very good, very good. (8) A press reception room was set up on the side, equipped with cigarettes and tea. (9) There were four doors to the venue, with two military police at each.

### Clouds Gradually Dissipating over the Situation in Northeast China: National Army Awaiting Takeover of Shenyang

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 9th] Today, it seems difficult for anyone to make a definite prediction about the future of the situation in Northeast China. The Chinese and Soviet military authorities have agreed to hand over the defense of Shenyang on the 15th, but whether this can be realized at that time depends on how the facts evolve. On this day last month, Du Yuming's troops had advanced to Xinmin City, and Shenyang was already within reach. A month has passed, and the situation on the Beining Line is not much different from a month ago. The reason for this is not that they have been obstructed by the Communist army, because their strength is not strong and they can be defeated with one blow. The main reason is still that the diplomatic aspects have not been properly handled, and there may be misunderstandings with the Soviet army. General Du Yuming is using the time to point his sword northward to clarify the situation on the left side of the Beining Line and to control the channel from Inner Mongolia to Northeast China. As for the Soviet troops stationed near the Beining Line, according to the Soviet side, Soviet troops are stationed in Xinmin County and Xinlitun County, but in reality, it is for procurement purposes. Soviet troops are also scattered around Dahushan and Heishan. A Soviet chief of staff contacted our front-line division commander, expressing welcome to the National Army's entry into Shenyang. We also sent senior officials to set up camp. General Du Yuming finally decided not to make an informal takeover for the time being. Whether or not to advance eastward in the future is still awaiting orders from the highest authorities. Currently, General Du Yuming is focusing on the area north of Heishan and east of Fuxin. General Du's next focus seems to be on the summer resort and hunting ground of the past Manchu emperors. The National Army soldiers fighting on the snowy front line are still not fully equipped with winter uniforms. Each army has only received 20,000 half-leather coats, and they have not yet received wool hats. Many soldiers' hands and feet are frostbitten, making it difficult to move. After their most elite partners, the New First Army and the New Sixth Army, arrive, they can be relieved of their most important tasks and rest for a while.

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 8th] Director Xiong Shihui flew to Jinzhou by special plane this afternoon to inspect. Lieutenant General Gao Ziju, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Military Administration, also flew there on another plane. It is generally believed that the situation in Rehe will have new developments in the short term.

### National Army Continues to Be Airlifted to Changchun: Shenyang Barracks Site Already Surveyed; Two Million Citizens Prepare Grand Welcome

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] There was snow and wind here yesterday, and air transportation was hindered. Today it is clear and sunny, and ten more planes arrived, carrying National Army troops. Twenty-nine personnel from the Ministry of Transportation, including Zhang Wei, Zeng Yuming, and Xiao Jingxuan, arrived on one plane at the same time as the National Army troops.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 8th] Director Peng of the camp construction team surveyed Dongda Camp and the Tiexi Industrial Zone this afternoon as sites for the National Army barracks. Mr. Peng and Soviet Garrison Commander Govorov held another meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and the result was satisfactory. The National Army is scheduled to take over the defense of Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Liaoyang, and Benxihu on the 15th. As for the date of takeover in Xinmin, it will be decided by Director Du himself. With the National Army's arrival in Shenyang approaching, the two million citizens here are preparing to step up preparations for a comfort conference. In addition to preparing to raise more winter clothes, they will also raise 20 million yuan for the military.

### Wedemeyer in Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Lieutenant General Albert Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in China, arrived in Chongqing by special plane from Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 10th and immediately went to Yi Garden to visit Special Envoy Marshall to report. It is understood that Mr. Wedemeyer will return to Shanghai tomorrow.

### Chen Jie to Go Abroad to Take Up His Post in Argentina

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Chen Jie, China's first ambassador to Argentina, is scheduled to go abroad on the 11th to take up his post.

### French Ambassador Merillon Pays First Visit to Foreign Minister Wang

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] The new French Ambassador Merillon paid a visit to Minister Wang Shijie at 10:00 AM on the 9th. The new Italian Charge d'Affaires Anzilotti also paid a visit to Mr. Wang at 2:00 PM on the 10th. Both were their first visits after taking office.

Editorial

### The First Session of the United Nations General Assembly

The first session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in London yesterday. Coincidentally, yesterday was the 26th anniversary of the establishment of the League of Nations in Versailles. It is believed that the United Nations General Assembly can accomplish the mission that the League of Nations failed to complete. Since the war to defeat the Axis powers began, military developments have often unfolded simultaneously with political developments. During this period, there were consultations among the leading figures of the Allied nations in Casablanca, Cairo, Tehran, Quebec, and Crimea, as well as international conferences in Bretton Woods, Dumbarton Oaks, and San Francisco. All efforts were focused on how to organize a strong United Nations organization to ensure lasting world peace. After repeated preliminary consultations, the first session of the United Nations General Assembly finally convened in London yesterday. People all over the world, especially the people of Asia and the people of China, who have endured long periods of war, have high expectations for the convening of this historically significant international conference.

The organization of the United Nations is the result of the ardent demands of the world's people after experiencing the painful lessons of this unprecedented war. The people of the United Nations have learned lessons from the war, understanding that peace is indivisible and that "all under heaven are one family." Today, any disruption of peace in one place will inevitably affect other places, and even the entire world's peace. Humanity had already learned painful lessons from the First World War, resulting in the League of Nations, hoping to maintain peace among nations. However, after the First World War, the League of Nations organization suffered from so-called inherent deficiencies, preventing it from exercising its due power, ultimately leading to the outbreak of the Second World War within twenty years. Having suffered the wounds of war, humanity has learned from past mistakes. What is needed is a strong international organization; this desire is reflected in the composition of the United Nations organization.

The United Nations international organization is fundamentally different in nature from past international organizations. First, the United Nations organization is primarily composed of countries that fought against the Axis powers in this war, especially the major countries that fought against the Axis powers. These countries encountered Axis aggression, using blood, flesh, and countless lives to defeat the Axis. They earnestly hope for lasting peace. The United Nations organization was cultivated with the blood of countless people of the United Nations. The exchange of blood gave them a new understanding of international organizations. Second, the current United Nations organization was mainly established under the inspiration of the late President Roosevelt and received active support from the United States. In the war to defeat the Axis, the United States made its greatest efforts. Due to the painful experience of the imperfect international organization after the First World War, the United States made its greatest efforts in the organization of the United Nations, just as it did in the effort to defeat the Axis powers. Such an organization not only bears the mission of maintaining lasting world peace but can also exercise its power to achieve its assigned mission.

The convening of the first session of the United Nations General Assembly in London is to formally create this organization, to use its functions to maintain world peace. It is said that the agenda of this first session, in addition to dealing with the issue of atomic energy control, includes: (1) electing six non-permanent members of the Security Council to cooperate with the five countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France, which hold the most power. The election of non-permanent members should be based on regional distribution; (2) electing the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization; (3) appointing a Military Committee to guide the military quotas that the Security Council should request each country to contribute; (4) the implementation of the trusteeship system; (5) the issue of the permanent headquarters of the United Nations. In addition to these, other issues may naturally be discussed. Judging from these agendas, it can be seen that the main task of this General Assembly is to organize the structure of the United Nations, so that this organization can operate as soon as possible. In how to operate this United Nations organization to exert its power, the United Nations cannot be compared with the League of Nations of the past. The current United Nations organization, with the United States as its main pillar, and the League of Nations' failure to obtain the participation of the United States, reflect a very interesting contrast. The New York Times, when sending the US delegation to the UK to attend the first session of the United Nations, said: "If the United States had joined the League of Nations, and if the member states of the League could have taken small risks to avoid great disasters, and taken decisive measures against aggressor nations, then the League of Nations would have had a better chance of success." Now, the United Nations organization, with the active participation of the United States, and in light of the past failures of the League of Nations, firmly believes that it will be able to take small risks to avoid great disasters in its operation.

At the San Francisco Conference, our delegation proposed that China, in order to promote the United Nations into a strong organization, was prepared to relinquish part of its sovereignty to the United Nations. The proposal was immediately praised unanimously by the American media, who considered it the most meaningful measure to support the United Nations organization. When US representative Eleanor Roosevelt arrived in London, she also declared to reporters: "The atomic bomb has made the people of the world aware of the responsibility of the United Nations organization. Success is not only what we hope for, we must work and hand over everything we have." It can be seen that in order to maximize the effectiveness of the United Nations organization, it is necessary to "hand over everything we have," including some components of national sovereignty. The error of past international organizations was that they placed too much emphasis on the nation and too little on the international organization. This attitude is no longer suitable for an atomic energy era like the present.

It goes without saying that the first session of the United Nations General Assembly in London will have important agreements on the organization of the United Nations. Regarding the issue of the permanent headquarters of the United Nations, it is said that a decision will be made to select one of two locations near Boston and New York in the United States. The selection of the headquarters is a meaningful measure. Although Boston is a famous city in American history, and it has world-renowned universities and cultural institutions, we feel that Hyde Park in New York is more suitable for the headquarters of the United Nations than Boston. In the effort to defeat the Axis powers, President Roosevelt made indelible contributions to humanity. Although President Roosevelt did not see the creation of the United Nations organization, the United Nations was indeed organized under the inspiration of President Roosevelt. Now that the United Nations has gathered representatives from fifty-one countries to seek lasting peace for the world, if its headquarters can be located in the hometown where President Roosevelt lived, grew up, rested, and where his tomb is located after his death, the representatives, while engaging in negotiations and discussions, can remember the great achievements of the late President of the United States for mankind, and it is believed that it will generate a subtle effect on the spiritual and mental level, which will be of great benefit to the maintenance of world peace.

### First Session of the United Nations General Assembly - British Prime Minister Delivers Opening Address - Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak Elected as President of the Assembly

[United Press, London, 10th] The General Assembly of representatives from fifty-one United Nations officially opened here today. This may be humanity's last attempt to prevent future wars. The opening time was 4:00 PM (midnight Shanghai time), at which time the sound of the meeting bell reverberated throughout the Central Hall near Westminster Abbey. First, British Prime Minister Attlee delivered the opening address, outlining the general issues of the new international organization. One of the representatives from a small country, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, will be unanimously elected as the President of the First General Assembly, after which the representatives will begin the work of organizing the United Nations, a task that will take four to six weeks to complete. At that time, the meeting will be adjourned until the second half of the year when it will reconvene at the permanent headquarters in the United States. What is striking is that today's gathering is the 26th anniversary of the day when countries attempted to initiate collective action to maintain world security. The representatives of countries gathered in Geneva to organize the League of Nations on January 10, 1920.

[Reuters, London, 10th] After extensive behind-the-scenes discussions over the past two days, the major representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly were honored with a grand banquet hosted by the British King last night. The main purpose of the informal gathering before the meeting was to ensure the smooth progress of the United Nations General Assembly. As for the topics discussed, nothing has been disclosed to date, but it is generally believed that thorny Soviet issues, the Soviet-Turkish dispute, and the Spanish issue have been raised in the deliberations. The most important issue of the General Assembly is the organization of the Atomic Bomb Control Committee, which is expected to involve heavy discussions. It is heard that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie was unable to participate in the General Assembly, so the Chinese delegation will be led by Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun. All news agencies and newspapers have completed extremely detailed arrangements to report the progress of this historic event to the world at any time.

No Disagreement Among Major Powers on Atomic Energy Control

[Reuters, London, 10th] As the first General Assembly of the United Nations organization is scheduled to be held here today, representatives are engaged in post-impact preparations and studying the agenda of the General Assembly. At the same time, US Secretary of State Byrnes refuted various rumors of disagreements among the major powers on the most important issue of the atomic bomb. Byrnes said last night: According to the wording of the Moscow resolution, preventive measures will be applied to all stages of any plan proposed by the committee, and any plan proposed by the committee must, of course, be submitted to the governments for approval in accordance with their constitutional requirements. Byrnes also said: There has never been a question of amending the Moscow resolution. The United States is very concerned about the success of the United Nations organization. He will stay here until the meeting is on the road to success. He believes that this meeting of the United Nations organization will be limited to discussing the details of the group.

This General Assembly's Work Emphasizes Organization

According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, those who expect this meeting to immediately resolve all outstanding world issues will be disappointed. The primary work of the General Assembly is organizational and legislative, in order to enable this organization to be effectively realized and to handle its dual tasks, namely to begin the economic recovery of the world and to prevent peace from being shattered. Simply setting up the necessary institutions is a very heavy task, which may consume all of the representatives' time in the first meeting of the General Assembly. However, the gathering of the world's responsible politicians in London provides an opportunity to engage in many important discussions outside the meeting room of the General Assembly, and the formation of future events in Europe may also be discussed in detail outside the General Assembly. The Deputy Foreign Ministers of the five powers will draft treaties of peace with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Finland, and Hungary in London. Difficult issues not specifically mentioned in the General Assembly's agenda include matters related to Turkey, Libya, Palestine, Indonesia, and China. And it would be surprising if the issue of the control of Germany does not advance further in London. In addition, the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will have a good opportunity to discuss the future steps regarding France and Spain. The question of who will lead the French delegation is still awaiting the final decision of General de Gaulle.

### Grand Banquet at St. James's Palace - British King's Speech - Hope for Goodwill and Understanding to Lay the Foundation for World Peace

[United Press, London, 10th] British King George VI hosted a public banquet at St. James's Palace last night for the chief representatives of all countries attending the United Nations General Assembly, and delivered a solemn speech, stating: "The well-being of all mankind in the world and their descendants is in your hands. You are responsible for laying the foundations of a new world. The most recent war nearly annihilated our world, and we must never repeat it in the future. In the new world, men and women can fully realize the brightness of the future, but the current goal cannot be achieved without effort and sacrifice. Joining the United Nations as a member is a service, not for selfish self-defense, or for the benefit of one country, but to serve the entire national society. This is an obvious characteristic. There is now a driving force that must inspire all actions, so as to deal with all difficulties in a spirit of cooperation, understanding, and goodwill. The tasks currently facing the United Nations are a crusade for world peace, which cannot be completed immediately, nor can it be fully completed unless we can understand, tolerate, and forgive each other."

### Relief Work Can Obtain Reasonable Support

[Reuters, London, 10th] The first General Assembly of the United Nations is expected to pass new subsidies for the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). The British delegation decided to propose collective support for UNRRA at the meeting. Considering the current situation, if cooperation is not strengthened to alleviate the economic pain of the post-war period and solve urgent problems, international political cooperation alone may not be enough to maintain lasting peace. The British delegation's proposal can make the United Nations fully aware of the importance and difficulties of UNRRA, so that the agency can become a powerful tool for international cooperation and reconstruction, backed by the United Nations, so that its funding can be sufficient. After the First World War, most of the credit for relief work was due to Herbert Hoover alone. The relief problems after this war are more serious than before. However, no one has yet advocated reasonable support. The UK's proposal, after its adoption, would allow UNRRA to be directly responsible to the Secretariat of the United Nations organization, ensuring continued funding and facilitating consultations with governments.

### US Initiates the Convening of an International Trade Conference

Twelve Countries Accept Invitation

[United Press, Washington, 10th] US government officials announced today that twelve countries have accepted the US invitation to attend the International Trade Conference to be held this spring, including China. The UK and France have indicated their willingness to consult with US representatives to begin reducing trade barriers.

### Truman's Economic Envoy Talks About His Impressions of Visiting China

[United Press, Washington, 9th] Mr. Maverick, an important figure in American business, went to China to investigate the interests of American businesses in the Far East for two months. After just returning, he met with President Truman today and submitted a report. According to Maverick, the negotiations on the Sino-US commercial treaty have been going on for eight months. The US State Department has submitted a draft to China, but neither government has made it public. The Chinese side is incomprehensible regarding the conclusion of the treaty. This kind of attitude should be corrected, so that all industries related to trade with China will know the basis on which they are permitted to operate. The United States should not lend funds until it knows the use of the loans and China's ability to repay them.

Maverick also said that he fully supports the friendly policy towards China, but this friendly policy must be based on post-war relations. China currently has no intention of facilitating the resumption of business by American businesses in China. This unstable situation must be resolved immediately. The number of officials in the US Embassy in China is extremely insufficient and must be greatly expanded and increased. It is difficult to handle relations with China wisely if the State Department does not obtain sufficient information from China.

### US and Soviet Military Authorities Discuss Korean Issues

[United Press, Seoul, 10th] US and Soviet military authorities stationed in Korea are preparing to hold negotiations in accordance with the Moscow Agreement in order to resolve various issues. US military commander Lieutenant General Hodge said: The Soviet Union has agreed to begin negotiations within a week or ten days. At the same time, the fighting among the parties in southern Korea has eased today. Representatives of the four major parties of the left and right wings jointly issued a declaration calling for support for the Moscow Three-Power Resolution to safeguard Korean sovereignty and independence and to assist in the development of democracy.

### UK's Position on the East Indian Question

Heavy Fighting in Sumatra

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The UK deeply hopes that Indonesians can gain autonomy, but does not hope for their independence, for the following reasons: (1) The British feel that the cultural development on the many islands to which Indonesia belongs is quite uneven, which could lead to various difficulties. (2) It is feared that extremists will seize power and promote the Japanese "Greater East Asia" policy, which may lead to hatred of white people and the danger of spreading to other parts of the Far East. This view is the same as that of some American military leaders.

[United Press, Batavia, 10th] According to the Dutch side's report from the East Indian Republican government, fierce battles between the East Indian independence army and the Japanese army have taken place in the Ajiche area of northern Sumatra. The number of incidents in Sumatra has increased compared to before, and the situation seems to be in chaos. Leaders of the Sumatran natives have protested to the British and Danish Allied forces, requesting that the Japanese army be disarmed as soon as possible.

### Gandhi Inspects Assam - Admonishes Indian Masses - Strive for Freedom Through Action, Not Slogans

[Reuters, Guwahati, Assam Province, 10th] When Gandhi arrived here from Calcutta to inspect the entire Assam Province, he gave a speech saying: We Indians seem to be about to achieve independence, perhaps it will be realized within a few days. When Gandhi's car stopped at night, he heard large crowds chanting slogans, so he said that freedom consists of more real and determined action than chanting slogans. Last night's situation was terrible. I still hope to live to be 120 years old, and I cannot tolerate this kind of phenomenon for several consecutive days. The Indian people's lack of discipline proves that they have not fully followed the non-violent doctrine I have been promoting for 25 years. However, the people of the country do not need to be discouraged. It is indeed not easy to make 400 million people obey discipline without using violence. Twenty-five years is not enough to carry out this major task. I hope to live to be 125 years old to witness the completion of my doctrine, but if I encounter events like last night again, I am afraid that this fragile old age will end in less than a month.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Officials here said yesterday that news from India said that the Secretary of State for India, Lord Lawrence, or the Under-Secretary of the Department, Hanson, will visit India in March. They do not know about this.

### Hitler's Will - Signatory Arrested

[Reuters, London, 10th] British military police officers said yesterday that General von Below, who signed Hitler's last will and testament, has been arrested in Bad Godesberg near Bonn on the Rhine. Von Below had changed his name not far from the headquarters of a British division, so he was not noticed. The arrest was made after a tip-off. The city of Bad Godesberg was where Hitler met with the late British Prime Minister Chamberlain before the signing of the Munich Agreement in 1938.

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang

Shanghai Robbers of Gold Apprehended in Songjiang

On the 5th of this month, an elderly woman was seen by the county detective squad attempting to exchange gold ornaments at a silver shop. Upon investigating the source of the ornaments, it was discovered that a major gang had robbed a large sum from the Lao Wannian Silver Shop in Shanghai and was hiding in the city. The police immediately apprehended two key suspects, Bao Wenyun and Xie Wuquan (who were originally from Songjiang and came from a wealthy family). A significant amount of gold ornaments was recovered. It was also discovered that accomplices were hiding in Shanghai. The squad dispatched officers to Shanghai, seized firearms, and the remaining gang members fled upon hearing the news. They are currently being pursued.

Kunshan

County Government Supervises the Collection of Military Grain

The county received orders to collect 50,000 shi (a unit of dry measure) of military grain, and has been actively proceeding with the task. A Military Grain Collection Committee has been established to oversee the process. However, the provincial grain funds cannot be allocated in full immediately, while the procurement of military grain is urgently needed. Therefore, a method of collection has been proposed, requiring each district to subscribe for and deliver a certain amount to the warehouse. Until the grain funds arrive in the county, temporary grain receipts will be issued to tenant farmers. Once the grain funds arrive, payment will be made upon presentation of the receipts.

Changshu

Frequent Reports of Robberies on Water and Land

Since the beginning of the year, frequent robberies have been reported here. The most significant cases are: (1) Zhou Junnan's home in Miaojiawan, outside the South Gate, was invaded by three robbers with guns who attempted to rob it. The attempt failed, and they shot and injured Zhou's wife, née Gao, in a location that needed to be treated in Suzhou. Unfortunately, she died from her wounds. (2) The Shaxi ferry encountered robbers at Xieyan in Dongtang City, resulting in losses exceeding six million yuan. (3) The Zhi Tang and Bai Ting boats were robbed one after the other at Yuyu Kou in Guli Village, each suffering losses of over five million yuan. (5) A Su-Chang Road automobile was intercepted by robbers at the Fifth Bridge, with no passengers spared. The authorities have been notified and are conducting a rigorous pursuit.

Suzhou

Request for the Return of the Suzhou Power Plant

The Suzhou Power Plant was originally a private enterprise. During the occupation, it was managed by the Japanese military. After the victory, Zhang Bintong of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was appointed as the receiving commissioner to take over and continue operations. The board of directors of the plant has submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to return the plant to private ownership in order to restore property rights. They have also sent a letter to the receiving commissioner Zhang Baotong, requesting a freeze on price increases until the return, in consideration of the people of Suzhou's hardship.

Jiangyin

Water Conservancy Committee Surveys River Embankments

In order to understand the actual condition of the river embankments along the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee has formed a survey team to inspect the embankments. It has been learned that the leader of the second team, Ding Chengwen, along with an assistant engineer, has arrived in Cheng from Nanjing and will begin the survey work immediately. After completing the work, they will proceed to Danyang, Yangzhou, and other places to continue their work.

He has been meticulously interrogating the more than fifty captured traitors, including Zhang Bojing, the "President of the Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce," and Huang Tongbao, an "informant for the enemy military police," in order to find concrete evidence for prosecution. It is expected that the investigation will be completed within this month.

### Date of Japanese General Election to Be Decided by Allied Supreme Commander; Prime Minister Shidehara's Resignation Dependent on the General Election

[United Press Tokyo, 10th] The date of the Japanese general election will be decided by the Allied Supreme Commander. The fact that it has not yet been announced seems to be a major key to resolving the current cabinet crisis. Well-informed Japanese sources stated today that the possibility of the entire cabinet resigning is increasing. The main question is whether Prime Minister Shidehara will be reappointed or replaced by a new person. If the general election is held soon, Shidehara may temporarily retain his cabinet members and then form a political party government after the election. However, if the election is postponed for several months, a new prime minister may have to be appointed. However, no instructions have been given as to when the final decision on when to hold the general election will be made. Influential American sources have expressed the view that purging unqualified candidates and reorganizing political parties are two separate issues. In addition, given the election preparation procedures, it is doubtful that the vote can be held before spring. Japanese sources said that the majority of cabinet members are convinced that a total resignation is necessary. If six or seven cabinet members resign, Shidehara himself will not be able to remain in office. However, it can be agreed in advance that after submitting a total resignation, the Emperor of Japan will reappoint him to form a new cabinet. Many Japanese believe that this will be done before Shidehara returns from his leave, or when he returns to office. Another option is for Shidehara to request the Supreme Commander to temporarily allow the cabinet members with problems to remain in office, or to approve their total resignation and appoint a new prime minister. According to well-informed sources, Shidehara will consult with his close advisors before making a final decision. However, the cabinet is secretly preparing to resign, and will implement it after a decision is made. Political activities are still underway behind the scenes. Foreign Minister Yoshida and other key cabinet members frequently visit the Prime Minister's residence. It is also reported that Yoshida has been in close contact with his father-in-law, former Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, who is deeply trusted by the Emperor of Japan and is a key figure in the current Japanese ruling class. According to news reports, Liberal Party leader Hatoyama declared when hosting reporters that the Shidehara government is incompetent, causing the current social unrest. The Liberal Party should cooperate with the Social Democratic Party to form a new cabinet to remedy the situation, which is the party's responsibility to the country. Although the party considers the current cabinet as a temporary cabinet before the general election, it has to change this attitude as the situation becomes more serious. A spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party also declared at the same time that if they can obtain four seats in the cabinet, they will nominate candidates. Observers believe that the two parties are making this proposal in order to increase representation in the next cabinet. However, it is doubtful whether they have sufficient strength to form a complete cabinet.

### Minister of Commerce and Industry Fujiyama Resigned Yesterday Morning

[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Aiichiro Fujiyama resigned this morning because he had previously served as secretary of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Political Association of Japan, which falls within the scope of MacArthur's recent directive.

[Our Newspaper Tokyo, 10th] The Shidehara Cabinet has decided to resign en masse. Interior Minister Horikiri said: "Some members of the Cabinet will resign, and I am one of them." He refused to answer questions about the MacArthur directive, but expressed his gratitude for President Chiang's broadcast regarding the Japanese people. He went to Shidehara's private residence, but because he was ill, he was received by his son, Toko Taro. Foreign Minister Yoshida arrived at that time, and he said that although they wanted to avoid a total resignation, it seemed unavoidable. As for the opinion of the Allied authorities, they believe that whether or not the Shidehara Cabinet resigns en masse should be decided by the current Japanese government.

[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Shidehara's assistant chief medical officer, Miyoshi, said today: "So far, the members of the Shidehara Cabinet have not discussed the issue of a total cabinet resignation." He said: "The cabinet is not scheduled to hold a special meeting today, but it will meet tomorrow." Shidehara has recovered from his illness after two weeks, but according to Miyoshi, he still needs to rest for a few days, so he will probably not be able to return to work as usual this week. "Yomiuri Hochi" said today that Shidehara has given up his plan to reorganize the cabinet and has decided to resign en masse, believing that the Emperor of Japan will order him to reorganize a new cabinet.

### Japanese People Collect Signatures Seeking Clemency for Yamashita

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 10th Dispatch] After Yamashita was sentenced to death, a movement to request MacArthur to spare Yamashita's life has emerged in Tokyo. Japanese people have gathered on the main streets of Tokyo to collect signatures, and have already obtained the signatures of 86,000 Japanese people.

### American Demobilization Measures to Be Announced and Implemented Soon

[United Press Washington, 9th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower today ordered overseas army commanders to send unnecessary soldiers home for demobilization. This order was announced by Acting Secretary of the Army Royall.

### Far Eastern Commission Held First Meeting in Tokyo Yesterday; Japanese War Crimes Tribunal Being Organized

[United Press Tokyo, 10th] The Far Eastern Commission held its first meeting here today at MacArthur's headquarters. Representatives from eleven countries and MacArthur's economic and scientific advisor, Major General Marquat, held consultations. The details were not disclosed. The commissioners then had lunch with MacArthur. In the afternoon, they continued to meet with Marquat. Meanwhile, the wartime transport ship "McKinley," carrying the commissioners and their entourage from Honolulu, arrived in Japan and has moved from Yokohama to the Tokyo docks today, where it will serve as the commissioners' headquarters and living quarters during their stay in Japan.

[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Far Eastern Commission Chairman MacMahon announced today that the representatives of the eleven countries will inspect Honshu after today's meeting, from Sendai to Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, and will also inspect the Hiroshima atomic bombing area. The commission's stay in Japan is limited, and it is scheduled to return to Washington on the 31st of this month.

[United Press Washington, 10th] According to reports, the Japanese war crimes tribunal is being organized and is expected to bring former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and other Japanese war criminals to trial within a month. This tribunal differs significantly from the Nuremberg International Tribunal for trying German war criminals. MacArthur will hold great power in the trial of Japanese war criminals, which has been specifically granted to MacArthur by the U.S. Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff. MacArthur has the right to: (1) appoint prosecutors and judges representing the nine participating countries; (2) review the court's judgment and reduce the sentence, but not increase it. MacArthur has repeatedly cabled Washington, requesting that the trial of Japanese war criminals in Tokyo be conducted entirely by the United States, in order to expedite its conclusion.

### Strange Fish Found in Siamese Rivers

[United Press Washington, 9th] According to a recent report by the Smithsonian Institution, Siam produces a type of catfish with a stout body that can swallow stones. Stones as large as a human fist have been found in the stomach of a catfish. It seems hard to imagine that catfish really eat stones to satisfy their hunger. It is likely that when they are gnawing on algae, the algae and stones stick together, and they accidentally swallow the stones and then spit them out. Visiting the rivers of Siam is like seeing a marine exhibition, where many strange things can be found. One type of fish can spray insects, causing them to fall into the water and then swallow them. Other fish cannot submerge in the water for too long, or they will drown. There is also a small fish that likes to climb onto the shore and move insects. In addition, there is a type of carp whose nose has developed into a suction tube, allowing it to suck stones in the water with its nose. The catfish that swallows stones can sign a contract with it, each taking what they need. When the catfish eats algae, the carp can suck the stones, so that the catfish doesn't swallow the stones.

Education and Sports

### President Chiang Discusses with Education Authorities; Punish Students Who Caused Trouble at National Provisional University; Eight People Detained After Investigation by the Capital District Attorney's Office

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 10th] The stern stance of Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, on handling the student unrest at the National Provisional University (Lin Da) has generated a good impression among intellectuals in the capital. Fourteen students, including Yu Boqing, who caused trouble, have been expelled by order of the Ministry of Education. The faculty and staff who resigned jointly due to the student unrest have all been retained. The Ministry of Education's decisive adoption of such strict measures for the Lin Da student unrest should be the starting point for reversing the academic atmosphere. After the order to expel the students who caused trouble was issued, the education authorities declared with certainty that if the students in that class were to resist guidance or disobey the rules again in the future, they would not hesitate to dissolve the entire class.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 10th Urgent Dispatch] President Chiang was very angry when he heard that a small number of students at National Provisional University were causing trouble and insulting teachers for no reason. He has instructed the education authorities to punish the students who caused trouble according to the law in order to correct the academic atmosphere. He instructed them to properly comfort the students in that class who were polite, law-abiding, and diligent in their studies, and to examine the students' actual needs in life and improve them appropriately.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 10th Urgent Dispatch] The Capital District Court Prosecutor's Office, on the grounds that class advisor Wang Shulin was injured in the violence, which involved a criminal offense, specially summoned fourteen students, including Yu Boqing, to the court for questioning on the morning of the 10th. On that day, nine people, including Yu Boqing, Sun Di, Li Shutang, Yao Dajun, Ding Jincheng, Ouyang Zhen, Yang Shihou, Yan Jiqing, and Sheng Chuanxian, arrived. Five others did not arrive, one of whom was said to have secretly gone to Shanghai. When the court opened, all the students gathered at the court, requesting to attend the hearing. The court did not allow attendance because it was an investigation court, so the students gathered in the court's main hall. The interrogation court began the interrogation at 9:30 a.m., using two people as a group. The interrogation was completed at 12:30 p.m., and eight people were detained in court, with only one person released on bail.

### Capital Universities to Reopen After Summer Vacation

[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] The president of Jinling University is currently planning the reopening of the university in Nanjing. Because the school buildings have been borrowed by cram schools, the cram schools are shortening the originally planned one-year cram period to the summer in order to let the universities reopen. The pre-university program at National Provisional University has a similar situation. It can also be completed by the summer, and the building will be returned to National Central University for classes to resume. In addition, the National Conservatory of Music has established a preparatory office for reopening on Guofu Road and plans to reopen. (An)

### Xikou Wuling School is Preparing to Start Construction for Restoration

[Dahua News Agency Xinghua News] Shi Jiyan, the director of the Feng Hua Xikou Wuling School, which was founded by President Chiang, went to Xikou under the order of President Chiang to prepare for the restoration of the school. He arrived at the end of last year. After inspecting the school, he believed that the damage was too great, and it would not be easy to restore it to its original appearance. He must ask President Chiang for instructions in person, so he recently left Xikou, passed through Ningbo, transferred to Shanghai, and flew to Chongqing. According to Zhu Kongrong, who came with Shi Jiyan, the repairs to the school buildings can begin after the instructions are received. As for the school affairs, in addition to actively enriching the elementary school department and temporarily setting up remedial classes for the middle school department, it is planned to add industrial and commercial departments in the future if conditions permit.

### Tangshan Institute of Technology Formulates Measures for Replenishing Instruments; Receives British Support from Sino-British Science Cooperation Office

[Our Newspaper Bishan Special Report] The National Jiaotong University Tangshan Institute of Technology, which was originally located in Tangshan, Hebei before the war, has moved several times after the war and suffered heavy losses. The current location is Dingjia Ao, Bishan, Sichuan. It is reported that a plan to return to the original location has been determined, and it can be moved back to the original location in Tangshan in May. The reinstatement committee of the institute received a letter from alumni in Beiping and Tianjin reporting that the Tangshan school buildings are still quite complete, but the instruments and books have disappeared. It is also reported that all the books were transported by the enemy to Baoding, and the institute plans to try to recover them when it returns north. The reinstatement committee of the institute has formulated measures to replenish the instruments. In addition to opening a list of losses and submitting it to the government to demand compensation from the enemy, it has also obtained the consent of the British person in charge of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office, who will provide the institute with the convenience of replenishing instruments and books in the future through a loan.

### Harvard University Adds International Relations Department; Focuses on China and the Soviet Union

[Associated Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, 9th] Harvard University is planning to add a regional studies course focusing on the Soviet Union and China, as part of the Department of International Relations. It is expected to be implemented in the academic year 1946-47. According to University President Buck, the addition of the regional studies course will be a pilot project. The course will include the language crash courses used by the Army during the war. Students will receive special training in general knowledge of the selected region and will be given the opportunity to study it. The Department of International Relations is based on world problems and is designed for those who aspire to diplomatic affairs, providing them with work that suits their individual needs, backgrounds, and interests. The University's Language and International Issues Subcommittee praised the establishment of the course, saying that it would use Harvard University's abundant talent to develop a course of study on international issues and languages, as there is no shortage of professors at the University who are familiar with the situation in the Soviet Union and China.

### Brief News

The Tongzhou Normal School was established by Zhang Jian of Nantong. During the national crisis, it suffered significant damage. Recently, alumni of the school residing in Shanghai planned to organize the Shanghai branch of the Tongzhou Normal School Alumni Association to assist in the school's restoration. Zhang Jingli, Tang Yishan, Song Zijing, and eight others were elected as standing committee members. A dinner and general membership meeting are scheduled for the 13th of this month at the Gongdelin vegetarian restaurant.

The original school building of the Lixi Cheng Primary School in the Penglai Road area of Nanshi, which was quite grand in scale, was occupied by the enemy and puppet forces during the occupation, resulting in considerable damage. After the victory, it was used as the headquarters of the 23rd Conscription Regiment, preventing its immediate return. It is now learned that the garrison headquarters ordered the relocation of the military police unit from the school building last month. Furthermore, the garrison headquarters convened a meeting of military and police leaders on January 2nd, which resolved to return all school buildings occupied by military and police forces. Therefore, the school is scheduled to hold a general alumni meeting at its current location on Sapose Road at 9:00 AM on the 13th of this month to discuss the arrangements for resuming classes.

The original campus of the University of Shanghai (沪江大學) in Yangshupu was occupied by the enemy and puppet forces when the war broke out. After the victory, it was stationed by the Korean Restoration Army, which has now been ordered to move out. The campus has been taken back by the university authorities. According to President Fan Zhengkang, the campus was severely damaged. The university originally planned to move back and resume classes this spring, but the repairs may not be completed in time, leaving the possibility of returning to the old site for classes this spring in doubt.

All public and private middle schools in Beijing will hold placement tests in the near future to reclassify students based on their performance. Whether or not elementary schools will hold similar tests is still under consideration.

The original location of the Shanghai Municipal Shangwen Primary School was on Xueqian Street in Nanshi. During the war of resistance, it moved to 291 Sapose Road in the former French Concession. After the victory, the original school building was occupied by the police bureau's security brigade and the second district management office of the public works bureau. Despite repeated negotiations, they refused to vacate, preventing the school from resuming classes to this day.

The Shanghai Primary School Physical Education Teachers' Association held its second preparatory meeting at the gymnasium the other day, with Wang Fu of the Education Bureau in attendance to provide guidance. It was decided that the inaugural meeting would be held two weeks after the start of the next semester.

Chongqing News: The National Women's Normal College had an unofficial strike over the relocation issue. After Cao, a section chief of the Ministry of Education, was sent to the college to persuade them, all students immediately resumed classes. The relocation issue has also been resolved. It is said that Tianjin and Qingdao are the most promising locations.

The Shanghai Education Loan Committee plans to organize a charity sale committee to collect items for auction. All proceeds will be used for loans. It is learned that the committee will hold a meeting at its premises at 735 Zhongzheng Road tomorrow (Saturday) at 2:00 PM, and letters have been sent to the principals of various schools and prominent figures from all walks of life, inviting them to attend and participate in the discussions.

At the same time, he also raised the issue of the new exchange rate, which has been delayed for some time, for discussion. It is heard that the principles have been decided. Once Mr. Song returns to Chongqing, they can be announced. As for the rumors that the new exchange rate will adopt a graded system, this is unlikely. The meeting ended at 10:30 AM.

Flying to Beijing this Morning

After the meeting, Mr. Song received Central Committee Member Pan Gongzhan and Jiangsu Supervisor Cheng Zhonghang in his office, and also met with Chen Guoying, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' office in Shanghai. Mr. Chen presented a report on the negotiations and handling of the "Berdine" ship's illegal transportation of the French Nazi Kaco Pingno. President Song believed that Mr. Chen's handling of this incident was quite appropriate. At 3:00 PM, he returned to his office to meet with Peng Xuepei and Liu Gongyun to inquire about the handling of enemy and puppet properties in the Shanghai area. After dinner at 6:00 PM, he went to his office to handle important official business. Zhao Zukang, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, went to pay his respects. It is heard that President Song is scheduled to fly to Beijing this morning, and the staff who came to Shanghai with President Song will also fly to Beijing on the same plane.

Sale of Goods

[United Press] Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen today instructed the Shanghai Enemy Property Handling Committee to sell large quantities of cotton cloth, winter clothing, rice, Taiwanese sugar, and refrigerated fish and meat at low prices in order to suppress prices. Mr. Song ordered the committee to use all means to complete the government's plan to stabilize prices and to suppress the current market prices of various items. He revealed that because of the shortage of goods on the market, the price of coal has risen to US$400 per ton. Measures have now been taken to manage fuel and import Vietnamese coal.

Chen Changtong Speaks

Yesterday, this reporter visited Mr. Chen Changtong, the manager of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China. According to his discussion, the government has conducted thorough discussions on the foreign exchange issue and has solicited opinions widely. It is now at the stage of announcement, and it is expected that it can be decided and announced after President Song returns to Chongqing. Mr. Chen went on to say that the setting of the new exchange rate will be based on commodity prices. The reason for the delay in its announcement is that commodity prices vary too widely in different places. Commodity prices are now tending to stabilize, so it is expected that the announcement of the new exchange rate is just around the corner. Mr. Chen has consulted with Chinese and foreign business people for their opinions. Importers and exporters do not think that the current natural exchange rate is too high or too low. Mr. Chen denied the rumors that the new exchange rate will be divided into several grades, saying that a simple and uniform foreign exchange rate is better to prevent abuses. However, luxury goods, etc., will be restricted. According to Mr. Chen, raising tariffs is the best way to restrict foreign exchange. The government's foreign exchange policy is to encourage exports, so as to balance our international balance of payments. Mr. Chen also said that fluctuating exchange rates make it easy for merchants to take risks, and commodity prices will also fluctuate, affecting people's livelihoods. According to the Bretton Woods Agreement, each country's adjustment of exchange rates is limited to within 10%. If this limit is exceeded, it must be decided by an international conference. Therefore, after our foreign exchange rate is announced, it will reverse the past practice of daily quotations and strive to achieve long-term stability.

### A Key Member of Shali's Gang, Nguyen Van Huong, is Arrested and Will Be Prosecuted as a War Criminal

### National Assembly Representatives in Shanghai Issue Statement Defending Civil Rights

[Central News Agency, this city] National Assembly representatives in Shanghai, Xi Yushu, Qin Liankui, He Yuanming, Zhou Xuexiang, Ding Zhongying, and others jointly issued an opinion defending civil rights, stating: "Since the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, the government has returned power to the people, fulfilling its promises. Last year, the government clearly ordered the convening of the National Assembly on May 5th of this year. The War of Resistance has ended, and the drafting of the constitution is underway. By following the law and keeping faith, the nation will be built. The National Assembly representatives in Shanghai, recognizing that the foundation of law and trust has been established, hope to contribute to the national interest and fulfill their mission by working hard to prepare for the constitution. They do not wish to add any other complications. However, constitutional government is based on the rule of law. If the rule of law is rejected first, what constitutional government can there be? Now, the government has invited dozens of representatives from various parties and factions, as well as several non-partisan figures, to form a political consultative conference. Its meaning is to reconcile the various factions, and its power is not to relinquish major policies. However, it is heard that some people intend to use the opportunity of consultation to attempt to re-elect National Assembly representatives, thereby delaying the return of power and seeking to divide power for their own convenience. How can this be what the people of the whole country hope for? We cannot remain silent. The Provisional Constitution has been in effect for fifteen years, but due to foreign troubles, its promises have not been fulfilled. However, the exercise of the power of governance, which legally represents the National Assembly, is still clearly stated in the Provisional Constitution and has not been diminished. Now that the National Assembly has been scheduled to convene, there is a legitimate way to return power. If we stop halfway and unite to divide power, we will be violating the law, breaking faith, and seizing civil rights. What is the rule of law? What is democracy? We, as representatives of the people, will never recognize its legal effect. Before the start of the consultation, we issue this statement, reporting to the government and the public, let us all uphold the rights of the people."

### The Stock Exchange is Preparing to Resume Business; the Public Exchange of the Former Shanghai Stock Exchange has Lost its Basis for Existence

The other day, the North China Daily News carried a message that foreign businessmen hoped that the British Public Exchange would resume business as soon as possible. This reporter made a special visit to a well-known banker in this port for this matter, and he was kind enough to express his opinion, stating that according to the laws of our government, only one stock exchange is allowed to be established in each region. The cancellation of the former Shanghai Commodity and Securities Exchange was based on this principle. The British Public Exchange was originally established based on extraterritoriality, and now that extraterritoriality has been abolished, the exchange has lost its basis for existence. It is now heard that the Chinese Stock Exchange is actively preparing to resume business, and Mr. Du Yuesheng is in charge of it. Mr. Du is a leader in the industrial and commercial circles and currently serves as the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce, and he is very familiar with Shanghai's industrial finance. Now that he is in charge of this matter, he will certainly be able to do it well. Our country is now trying to attract foreign investment and engage in construction. Friendly countries should be able to support this move to facilitate foreign investment. In my personal opinion, anyone with relevant experience and qualifications can participate, such as domestic foreign banks joining the unified method of the Silver Industry Exchange. As for the listing of stocks of Chinese and foreign companies, as long as they comply with our country's laws, they should not be divided into different regions and should have equal opportunities. It is best to have financial and industrial organizations to form a credit investigation agency to jointly participate in the review, and the content of each company should be investigated in detail for the reference of investors. It is heard that the institute has now hired experienced experts to plan carefully according to the systems of the British and American exchanges. When preparations are complete, it can be officially resumed.

Li Ze's Trial Scene

### Criminal Court Transfers to Prosecutor's Office Li Ze Case Investigated Again Yesterday Employee Representatives Submit Evidence and Make Pledges

[Our Report] The sensational Li Ze case, originally scheduled by the High Court to be tried at 9:40 AM yesterday in the Special Criminal Court at Ti Jian Bridge. Before 9:30 AM, Li Ze's wife and younger brother arrived at the court to listen in, and reporters from various newspapers also arrived in droves, reaching seventy or eighty people. In the piercing cold wind, they waited until 9:30 AM, but still no news of the trial opening was heard. At this time, Chen Tingrui, the defense lawyer hired by Li Ze, also arrived and asked the bailiffs, who replied that there were no cases being tried today. However, everyone's summons clearly stated 9:40 AM on the 10th.

Re-investigation Changes to Prosecutor's Court

Later, a staff member of the court revealed: For the sake of prudence, the case has been sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for re-investigation, and then a decision will be made as to whether to file a public prosecution. At this moment, Li Ze was brought from the prison to the office by bailiffs, head held high, but his face was haggard and his temples were covered in white hair. The buttons on his blue serge robe were not fastened. Soon after, Prosecutor Dai Yunduo arrived in court and announced: This case has been transferred by the High Court to this office for re-investigation. During the investigation period, listening in is not allowed according to law. The bailiffs drove the crowd out of the court, causing a great uproar. The crowd questioned the prosecutor, who explained in detail that witnesses who had received summonses could still enter the court to confront Li Ze in turn. Only then did the crowd leave the court.

Former Positions Claimed to be Involuntary

Li Ze was the first to be summoned and questioned for about half an hour. Li admitted to the two false positions of director of the "Business Coordination Council" and the "Sixteen Kinds of Commodity Evaluation Committee," but claimed that he was forced by the environment and not voluntary. Subsequently, employee representatives Han Wucheng, Shu Yueqiao, Yao Zhuoren, Ye Qiubin, and others were summoned to court to confront Li Ze. Han and others submitted evidence to prove that Li Ze had indeed held false positions. The prosecutor ordered the four to make pledges, stating that if they were accomplices in false accusations, they would willingly accept punishment, the penalty being seven years of imprisonment. Subsequently, Huang Zhenguang, a senior employee of the New New Company, and Han Zhiming and Zhiyuan from the Sen Da Iron Factory were summoned to court with the account books for September of the 33rd year to be verified. According to Han and others, more than a hundred water crafts were purchased by the Sen Da Iron Factory from the New New Company, for a total price of 2,074,000 in counterfeit currency. Fifty million was paid the first time, sixty million the second time, and the full amount was paid the third time. All were checks from the Shanghai Xingye Bank. It has been found that the bank has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to suspend operations and liquidate, so it must wait until the bank's transaction records are reviewed before it can be proven. The trial ended at 1:20 PM, taking two and a half hours. At 5:00 PM yesterday, ten employee representatives from the New New Company, including Han Wucheng, received summonses from the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, ordering them to go to the headquarters this morning at 10:00 AM to await questioning, but Shu Yueqiao was not summoned, nor was the case being investigated specified.

Garrison Headquarters Also Investigated Yesterday

The Garrison

Headquarters Inspection Office had previously questioned Li Ze by Inspector Bi Gaokui. Yesterday morning, Fang Xuegu, the director of the company's art department, and Liang Gongchen, the director of the cosmetics department, who went to the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the "Exhibition" in the 31st year, were summoned to the Garrison Headquarters for questioning. Inspector Bi personally questioned them, inquiring in detail about their experiences in puppet Manchukuo. According to Fang Xuegu, the puppet Ministry of Industry sent Chen Zhong to purchase a large number of goods from the New New Company to be transported to the Northeast to participate in the so-called "Greater East Asia Exhibition," requesting the company to send personnel to accompany them to sort and arrange them. Because the puppet authorities repeatedly requested, Liang Gongchen and Chen Bosong were sent to go with him. The accompanying persons were Chen Zhong from the puppet Ministry of Industry, a Jin official from the puppet Counselor's Office, a Niu commissioner from the puppet Counselor's Office, and other staff members from the puppet Ministry of Industry, a total of seven people. Inspector Bi asked: In addition to the New New Company, were there any other companies transporting goods to the puppet Manchukuo Exhibition? The answer was: No. According to Liang, the travel and accommodation expenses were all paid by the puppet Ministry of Industry. The company told us to see how the business was there.

Commercial News

### Major Investors Shift Focus Gold Prices Gradually Decline New Hong Kong Dollar Notes Show Activity Again

Red-hot stocks continued to trend downwards yesterday, and those holding goods felt bored, settling their accounts and seeking other outlets. The situation became one-sided, but the process was mediocre, with much fluctuation. After opening at 845,000 in the morning, it gradually declined from 847,000. Although several households took advantage of the low prices to buy in the middle, their strength was limited and it was difficult to see any rise. Major investors followed the trend and, seeing the situation was not good, shifted their focus to foreign stocks and public bonds. The market gradually declined, and by noon it had fallen to around 825,000. The afternoon was the same, and those in the industry were dispirited and trading was sparse. As a result, the close was down 10,000 from the previous day. Gold jewelry was listed at 88,000, silver taels at 700 yuan, and silver dollars at 450 to 460 yuan. The secret discount was still between six and nine cents. The gold market was stagnant, and floating capital tended to public bonds and new Hong Kong dollar notes to seek other developments. If there is no special stimulus, the gold market will be even more deserted.

The US dollar is still difficult to boost due to the sluggish gold market, but the situation is still stable. It initially showed a slight improvement in the morning, but as the gold market deteriorated, it was dragged down. It once fell below 1420 yuan at noon, and then it was slightly pulled up. As a result, it closed down 15 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong dollar notes were favored by securities firm investors, and floating capital followed, buying new notes. As a result, the new notes rose. The old notes were mediocre due to the lack of speculative atmosphere, while the new notes rose by 5 yuan.

### Yarn Prices Become More Stable

Yesterday's yarn market started down and ended strong. Initially, it continued the previous day's weak trend, falling another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. For example, 20-count Double Horse once fell to 650,000, and 16-count Guangming once fell to 400,000. Then, due to the successive purchases by inland investors and fellow traders, although the transaction volume was not large, the market was enlivened a lot. Each yarn rose by 40,000 to 50,000. Finally, 20-count Double Horse was traded at 700,000, and 16-count Guangming was traded at 440,000 to 450,000. As a result, the market price was similar to the previous day, and people's hearts were no longer as weak as the day before yesterday, but became more stable.

### Sales in Various Places Gradually Open Up The Tea Market Continues to be Attractive

The Ningbo area of Zhejiang is also a rich tea-producing area. According to people in the pharmaceutical industry, when the enemy puppets were entrenched, the people were quite miserable under various oppressions, especially the tea farmers, who suffered the most. Whenever the new tea came on the market, the traffic was blocked, making sales difficult. Although there was no shortage of human consumption in the producing area, the income was ultimately not enough to cover the expenditure. Therefore, people changed to other industries, and some even chopped down tea trees for firewood. Therefore, the tea production is declining day by day. At present, the enemy puppets have surrendered, and the sales in various places are gradually opening up. Recently, Jiangbei, Tianjin and other places have shown a great willingness to accept tea. Unfortunately, the supply of red and green tea in this city has been exhausted for a long time, and the stock has not been replenished, resulting in a shortage of supply and soaring prices. Yesterday, Tong Taixiang sold Huizhou fried green tea, and the price rose to 44,000 yuan per load, a increase of more than 4,000 yuan compared with the previous increase. Other varieties are also strong.

### Rice Prices Rise Across the Board

The rice and grain investors from Tianjin and Qingdao are very enthusiastic. Early indica rice soared by 700 to 800 yuan, and northern japonica rice also increased by 400 to 500 yuan. Indica rice and glutinous rice both rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Flour is scarce and still firm, but the enthusiasm for investing in Southeast Asia has waned. The oil market was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, and the market temporarily lacked glory and disgrace. Soybean cake from Taiwan and Shantou is still being absorbed, rising by another 100 yuan. Soybeans have returned to a small increase of 200 to 300 yuan. The liquor market rose by 500 yuan with the rise in rice prices.

### Turmeric Production Prices Rise

Turmeric was previously very firm due to the scarcity of arrivals and stocks, but it has returned due to slightly sluggish sales. According to a quick report from the producing area of Shangrao yesterday, someone has been collecting turmeric recently, resulting in a production price increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The Shanghai market is relatively stable, with about 50 loads of goods being offered, priced at 18,000 yuan.

### Floating Capital Concentrates on Public Bonds Class C Breaks Through Three Levels Stock Market Generally Mediocre

The public bond market was unusually strong yesterday. Chinese investors and floating capital joined in, but the stage was narrow. Once major investors pulled up the price, retail investors followed suit. Various ideals and rumors abounded. Class C consecutively broke through the major levels of 1,000, 1,100, and 1,200 yuan from the initial price of 970 yuan in the morning. Short sellers were forced to cover urgently, and at noon it soared to a new high of 1,255 yuan, and then slightly pulled back. As a result, compared with the previous close, Class A and B rose by 320 yuan, Class C rose by 200 yuan, Class D rose by 320 yuan, and Class E rose by 280 yuan. Floating capital was widely mobilized to take advantage of the price market, so that miscellaneous brands were much more attractive than Class C and E.

The Chinese stock market fluctuated greatly, but because major investors were concerned with other things, retail investors were unable to boost the price. Although there were many good rebounds in the middle, the chips had become loose, and it was nothing more than major investors pretending to make a show, and that's all. After struggling, the noon close compared with the previous close showed that Yongsha fell by 80 yuan, Meiya fell by 30 yuan, and Sanxiao was slightly down by 1 yuan and 2 yuan. Real estate stocks continued to make progress under the rumor that the property registration of real estate companies could be exempted from taxes.

Because securities firms and paper industry investors continued to be active in foreign stocks, Yisha was the target of public investment, and the market was still vigorous in the first half of the day. However, the overall trend was unfavorable, and those who profited came continuously, so it could not be supported at noon. However, Ye Guang continued to show luster under the favorable rumors. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha fell by 150 yuan, Yizao and Paper fell by 50 yuan each, and Huidemeng and Yeguang rose by 150 yuan each. Rubber stocks were mediocre and unchanged.

### Silk is Weak

In the midst of the plunge in yarn and cloth, silk also inevitably followed the trend. Rayon opened weak in the morning, with 120 Tianqiao at 830,000 yuan, and retreated to the 800,000 level at noon. Silk mills bought in at low prices, and the price rebounded, closing at 830,000 yuan in the evening, a small decrease of 20,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The spot of rayon is quite scarce, and the demand exceeds the supply, often low and then high. However, the overall trend is difficult to avoid weakness. The market situation for factory warp is quiet, and the price is stable. The price of silk goods shows a decline. Meiya quilt face was traded at 550,000 yuan, Dachen checkerboard crepe factory's market has not opened, and the market is doing 1,650 yuan, and Minsheng brocade is still on the original market.

### Fuhua Company Moves to Shanghai to Increase Production of Export Silk

In the spring of the previous year, National Assemblymen Leng Yuqiu and others, in order to revive the silkworm silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, promoted the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Third War Zone to jointly form the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silkworm Silk Industry Revitalization Committee, engaged in the investigation of the enemy-puppet silkworm silk industry in the occupied areas and the propagation of mulberry seedlings. At the same time, they also initiated the establishment of Fuhua Silk Company, grabbing raw silk from the occupied areas to meet the needs of the Allied countries. In the early winter of the previous year and the summer of last year, they twice grabbed hundreds of ancestral raw silk and exported it. The company has a capital of 350 million national currency, and has leased Hangzhou Wei Cheng Company and Kaiyuan Silk Factory, the largest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, adding new-style multi-strip silk reeling machines and improving the original equipment. It is scheduled to officially start work in mid-March, and can produce more than 300 loads of high-grade export raw silk per month. The chairman of the company is Leng Jieqiu, and the general manager is Shen Jiuru.

### Tinplate Prices Rise

Since the arrival of bottled kerosene from Yingfu, Texas and other companies in Shanghai, the demand for kerosene tank blanks has been strong, and the market price has been rising steadily. In less than half a month, the price of 112-pound bodies has risen from 15,000 yuan to about 30,000 yuan per box, and the price of 156-pound bottom covers has also risen from 25,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan per box.

### Coal Prices Stabilize Coal Jin Luo Yi Transported

After the return of white coal screened lumps, the price has stabilized. White coal fines are selling well due to the popularity of coal balls, and trading is quite active. The arrival of firewood and charcoal is still crowded, and the trend is weak, and the market price may fall again. Coal ships are coming one after another. The Lin'e Tai of the British Far East Shipping Management Office, which loaded 8,300 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The ship did not arrive yesterday, and will be imported today. In addition, the William Futmale wheel of the management office is also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, with 3,200 tons of coal. In addition, the Zhongshan of the American President Company is also scheduled to transport 9,000 tons from Taihuang Island today. The coal transported by the above three ships is all consigned by the Fuel Committee.

### Commercial Situation Summary

The turnover of sugar is even stronger. Although there are continuous arrivals, the supply and demand are still not balanced, and the market is rising again. It is feared that it will be difficult to fall in the short term.

Dyes are still trending upward due to the fact that investors are seeking blue red light black indigo powder double goose yuan nine boy yuan ma gu lian.

Knitted products continue to decline in price because they are prohibited from exporting along with cotton yarn and cotton cloth.

The turnover of cigarettes is flat, and the distribution of goods is uninterrupted. Gold prices continue to fall, so the market is falling in the selling trend.

Rosin and beeswax are selling well, and the goods have not yet arrived in Shanghai. Those who hold the goods are supporting the price, so the price is higher than the previous day.

The timber market, which has been quiet for a long time, is thriving due to the recent purchases by Nanjing investors. The road trend was stable yesterday.

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to various industry associations, requesting that the number of members who have joined the association be reported in detail within three days as of yesterday, so as to facilitate statistics.

### After the Franc Devaluation The Black Market for Foreign Currencies Soars

Spring and Autumn

### The Long March at Sea

— Zhuang Junpeng

The sea is so vast, the sky is so high, the water connects to the sky, the sky connects to the water, the water surges with white waves, and all around is just the connection of water and sky, and not a single piece of land can be seen. Clouds of various colors float in the sky, drifting with the wind. Gulls fly in groups of three or five over the sea, sometimes flying high, rushing into the clouds, and sometimes flying low, skimming the water and dancing.

A sailing boat called "Liberty" is heading south! On board are a dozen young Chinese men and women, who admire freedom, love freedom, and want to use their power to open up freedom, explore freedom, create freedom, cultivate freedom, nurture freedom, ... to establish a "free" "new world" - Utopia. The boat is in the middle of the sea, its sails are raised, its rudder is set, and it is sailing forward, sailing forward, the waves are hitting the hull, suddenly spitting out a white foam, the waves are getting bigger and bigger, and the wind is blowing harder and harder, our little boat is really too small, wandering in the blue waves, the cloth sail seems to be unable to withstand the fierce attack of the wind, several times it is about to capsize or break, although the helmsman changes every day, but they have no sailing experience, and after a few days of fatigue, they are exhausted, as if they can only let nature take its course, and follow the wind forward, they and she are fighting against the wind and waves!

This long march at sea will naturally suffer from wind and huge waves, but the partners on board do not care at all and do not feel afraid at all. In order to "escape reality," they are willing to take the risk of going far away, and are very willing to endure it. They cannot get used to the cruel battlefield, they cannot get used to the disguised paradise, they know that peace is the hypocrite of mankind, they know that war is the ambitious person of mankind, they doubt what is called justice? What is called justice? What is called democracy? What is called freedom? What is called happiness? ... They have firm beliefs, a brave spirit, and everyone is confident: "In the near future, they will sail to the shore of happiness, the land of freedom, - where they can establish Utopia, - a country without money, obviously they have suffered from the persecution and exploitation of money.

They are not only afraid of the wind, not afraid of the waves, but also fight with an indomitable spirit, and continue to move forward! Sometimes they look at the floating clouds in the sky, which change rapidly; sometimes they look at the white gulls on the sea, soaring freely; sometimes they look at the vast blue sea; sometimes they look at the white waves, and sometimes they are in the mood to sing a song of "freedom," "equality," "fraternity," ... accompanied by a harmonica, with ups and downs, how pleasant! They love "freedom" so much that they are afraid it is more "valuable" than their own "lives." Especially when they see the gulls rushing up into the sky and skimming over the sea, they really envy this kind of "free" life.

Night has come, the whole sea is surrounded in darkness, so they can't tell the east, west, north, and south, they only feel a salty breath in their noses, and they only hear the roaring waves in their ears. Although they can say that they have been living at sea for more than ten days, this is the first time they have encountered this kind of experience. Maybe "God" is not willing to "beautify" them, and deliberately "make things difficult" for them! The future is so treacherous, which cannot make them lose heart at all, but increases their courage a hundredfold, and they strive to move forward. In order to strengthen their courage, everyone sang a "Volga Boatmen's Song" in unison, because everyone raised their voices to sing, so it was louder and more energetic than the last time. The wind was also blowing furiously, and unfortunately half of the canvas was blown away by the wind, and they could no longer take advantage of the wind to go. Everyone was quite surprised, but there was nothing they could do. They simply unloaded the lower half of the sail, which would at least make the boat more stable.

It was late at night, the wind was strong and the waves were high, and the boat's body inevitably tilted east and west, letting it move forward in the sea. Mingqiang, the youngest on board, said, "What's wrong! Why is the boat not moving? Could it be that the boat has hit a reef?" The slightly older Ziqiang smiled and said, "Don't be afraid! There are no reefs here, how can it hit a reef?..." Captain Liming said, "The boat is not moving, it really is not moving, let's not panic, look! In the farthest place over there, there seems to be a line of lighthouse light, maybe there are no reefs here..." Before he finished speaking, Lifen pointed to the east and said, "You don't have to argue, it will definitely be dawn soon, look! Isn't there a line of light over there? And this light doesn't look like the light of a firefly lighthouse..." Huifen joked, "This must be land, ... the boat may have been stuck in the mud by the shore." Yuqin said sternly, "Didn't everyone see a round of rising sun over there? ... not from purple to red, red to white, soon the sun will have light coming out, the beauty of sunrise at sea, or the first time in my life! Zhigao was the first to walk to the bow of the boat, and at that time there was really more sunlight, and the sun was also rising. He saw at a glance that the boat's body was really stuck in the mud by the shore. He happily kicked hard with both feet and suddenly jumped onto the shore stone. Then more than a dozen young men and women jumped ashore one after another, singing a "Victory" song on the shore, not only loud, but also majestic. Their ideals have been realized, and "freedom" has also been realized. Think about it: how happy they are!

This small island is called "Freedom Island."

### Starting from Eva Braun's Diary

— Shi Jimei

Adolf Hitler, this mysterious and unpredictable oddball, was thought to be a lifelong bachelor, but who knew he would suddenly get married before committing suicide? The bride named Eva Braun said, "To die with Hitler is the supreme glory."

If this record is true, leaving aside political positions, we find the dramatically poignant scene of a "martyr dying for his country, a chaste woman dying for her husband" deeply moving and worthy of some sympathy. Especially for a woman like Eva Braun, who willingly dedicated her precious life completely to a man at the end of his road, regardless of what kind of person he was, she was still great. It seems that among all the women in Germany, even the world, only she truly understood genuine love. Therefore, in a psychological state devoid of excessive reason and filled with emotion, one might even recall that pair of heroic figures from ancient China surrounded by the "songs of Chu on all sides," Xiang Yu and his Consort Yu.

However, is that really the case?

We read another piece of news in the newspaper the next day: American intelligence agents discovered the diary written by Hitler's mistress. The diary was written in 1935, and that mistress was Eva Braun—the bride who married him in 1945.

As a result, all dramatic and touching emotions were lost; we only feel that Hitler was an undeniable oddball, who even on his deathbed remembered to leave behind a shocking arrangement to give posterity novelty.

Reading Eva's diary, there is a passage: "The wind is gentle, and the sun is bright, the weather is good. Yet I—the wife of the most important person in Germany and the world—must sit at home withered, leaning on the window, gazing at the sky..."

What melancholy and resentful few words! Just these few words write out countless grievances and sorrows. Eva Braun is not a writer, but she wrote the emotions and flavors she experienced more truthfully than anything else. Clever Chinese poets also used the line, "Suddenly seeing the color of willow branches at the edge of the road, I regret having urged my husband to seek a title," to describe it, although the author was not a woman.

In our real lives, there are many, many glamorous and noble women. They are graceful in every way, adorned with pearls and jewels, golden branches and jade leaves, they... However, are they happy and satisfied with all this superficial luxury and wealth? Are there tears, complaints, and tightly furrowed brows behind that golden curtain?

I think of Eva Braun, and many, many women like her, and I can't help but recall a saying: "Women use youth and beauty to add to the glory of men, but their glory is only the love and favor of men."

I don't know if these words are right or wrong, but since I thought of them, I might as well write them down and dedicate them to the newlywed Marlo. Her husband is a kind and good young man, an engineer who is neither famous in the world nor possesses great wealth; I wish them eternal happiness!

### Flying Together (3)

— Zhao Qingge

(3)

Mrs. Mo didn't sleep well all night, her stomach aching continuously in waves. She had just drifted off into a hazy sleep when she was awakened by Mr. Mo, and couldn't help but kick him hard.

"What are you doing? You're so old, yet you can't sleep peacefully like a child."

"What? You, what are you saying?"

"I'm asking what you're dreaming about? I just want to close my eyes for a while, and you're shouting and screaming."

Mrs. Mo grew angrier as she spoke. If her body wasn't uncomfortable, she would have liked nothing more than to get up, hold him down, and punch him a few times to vent her anger.

"I was dreaming? You say I was dreaming?"

Mr. Mo became somewhat sober. He opened his eyes and looked around. It turned out he was lying on the bed. He then touched his body with his hand, and he was not stuck in the mud but wrapped tightly in a soft silk cotton quilt. Thus, he happily breathed a sigh of relief.

"If you weren't dreaming, you were visiting hell! Otherwise, why would you be shouting 'fight the ghosts, fight the ghosts' so early in the morning?" Mrs. Mo said before angrily turning over. Mr. Mo then understood that he had disturbed his wife because of his dream, so she was now throwing a tantrum.

"Yes. I just had a strange dream!" Mr. Mo humbly admitted to Mrs. Mo.

At this time, roosters in the distance crowed the dawn. Mr. Mo gently lifted the bed curtain and glanced at the window. He saw that the morning sun was rising, and the room was already bright.

"Ah, it's already dawn!" Mr. Mo said to himself as he lowered the curtain.

"I'll say it again: I didn't sleep well all night! Did you hear clearly? It's dawn, so get up early for me. Go to the study! Don't keep babbling to me." Mrs. Mo was practically giving an order.

"Uh!"

Mr. Mo responded as he sat up and got dressed. When he got out of bed, he was especially careful to cover his wife with the quilt and tucked in the curtain. He hastily washed his face, and then quietly walked out of the room and went to the study in the west wing.

Mr. Mo loudly recited the Book of Poetry for a while, and then coughed for a long time before he saw the family members appear one by one. The first one to walk into the study was Bao Ling—Mr. Mo's only son.

"Bao Ling, recite that 'Three Character Classic' once more today, and recite it to me later."

After Mr. Mo said this, Bao Ling "mm"ed and obediently went to sit at the desk where he did his lessons every day.

Then, Mo Sheng brought a bowl of red date porridge, which was Mr. Mo's breakfast. Mr. Mo looked at the porridge and didn't say anything, only sighed deeply.

"Master, please make do with a few sips! I heard you coughing so badly earlier, so I specially rushed to cook it myself. Alas! Nowadays, there's nothing to say! Bird's nest and white fungus are so expensive that you dare not even ask about them."

Mo Sheng, seeing Mr. Mo's distracted look, understood what he meant, so he couldn't help but persuade him with a few words.

"I know!" Mr. Mo uttered these three meaningful words somberly.

Mo Sheng didn't find it appropriate to say anything more, and he respectfully retreated.

Mr. Mo drank the bowl of red date porridge with all sorts of feelings. Because of Mo Sheng's words just now, and the extremely polite bow he made when he left, Mr. Mo's past was brought to his heart!

### Seagull

— Ren Jun

You are the children of the ocean! You work on the ocean,

Play on the ocean,

Live on the ocean; The boundless ocean,

Is your universe,

Your home, how free you are! However, the little sparrow tilts its head,

Sticking out its chest, twittering its high-minded opinions: "Rolling around in the waves all day and night, what an unstable life! When the storm comes, and the waves surge as high as mountains, it's even more dangerous! Why bother! We are much more comfortable; under the eaves of people's houses, we build a small nest, marry and have children, peaceful, happy... Safe from wind and rain."

Oh, seagull! Are you smiling bitterly? Yes—to understand the ocean, to understand you, the little sparrow's head and chest are really too small and narrow!

Social Service. This newspaper and Xinwenbao Newspaper and other commercial entities jointly manage student aid. Fundraising is comprehensively planned, and subsidized students receive the same aid as before.

This newspaper's student aid fund has been in operation for nine sessions. In the past, due to the government's relocation during the Anti-Japanese War, the government's influence could not reach most of the needy students in Shanghai, so the responsibility of providing relief could not be fully carried out. The colleagues of this newspaper's student aid fund, based on the innate human duty of mutual assistance, combined social strength and collective effort to handle student aid affairs, directly seeking relief from the pain of youth uprooted and impoverished during the war, and indirectly contributing to the nurturing of talents for society and the country. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, and the sun has shone again, our government authorities have long since completed their return. This student aid movement should be comprehensively planned and uniformly managed. Therefore, this newspaper, Xinwenbao, and the "Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee" headed by the Municipal Education Bureau have repeatedly discussed and decided to cooperate. This is truly a new era in the student aid movement. The three parties, as a single entity, cooperate sincerely, and it undoubtedly increases great strength in manpower, material resources, and financial resources. It is hoped that people from all walks of life and readers will maintain their past enthusiasm, cooperate even more, and enthusiastically donate, so that funding will be sufficient and our student aid effectiveness can be brought into full play. The country and society are deeply reliant on this! As for the students who received aid in the previous session from Shen Bao and Xinwenbao, we will do our best to seek relief together. We hope that you students will bravely forge ahead and complete the mission of hard work!

Letter from a Reader in Changshu

### Please the County Government to Appropriately Reduce Rental Rates

Editor: We humbly borrow a corner of your esteemed newspaper to appeal to the suffering of our tens of thousands of farmers, hoping for your permission. Now that the enemy has surrendered and the sun has shone again, everyone is jubilant, rejoicing and raising their foreheads to celebrate. At the same time, the National Government has clearly ordered the exemption of land tax in the occupied areas, and the benefits have reached all people, who are grateful and appreciative. However, the farmers in the seventh district of Changshu alone are not receiving such benefits, causing them deep doubt! As this district has public properties such as You Wenbin's education fund, an orphanage, and a charitable ferry, before the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the rental rate per acre was only 1.05 yuan. After deducting surcharges and the land tax that should be paid, the actual rental amount was only a little over 5 jiao. At that time, the price of rice was 9 yuan per shi, which is equivalent to only 5 sheng or so. Now, the public property office has come to this district to collect rent, and after deducting the 25% rent reduction per acre, they are still collecting 1.2 dou of rice, which is the same amount as collected by the enemy puppets in previous years. Upon inspection, the farmers in our seventh district who lease land are different from those in other counties, in that they can freely buy and sell, and the property rights always belong to the farmers. Therefore, they naturally have the right to enjoy the exemption from land tax. It is clear that the rent collection office this year can only collect a portion of the rent interest. Now, they are acting rashly, not knowing on what basis. Can the enemy puppets' past practices be used as a rule for future rent collection? The people in our seventh district, in addition to shouldering 10 million yuan of legal tender in loans from the county government and all the expenses of the district office, already feel exhausted. Amidst the 25% rent reduction and the clear order to exempt land tax, the rental rate collected is actually heavier than in previous years. Are the farmers in our seventh district of Changshu not citizens of the Republic of China, who should not enjoy the national favor of land tax exemption? Or does the local government, facing economic difficulties, want to take from the farmers to make up for them? Survivors of the catastrophe, covered in scars, after experiencing the depths of misery, are now suffering from arbitrary levies. The grief of the small people is unparalleled! We deeply hope that the authorities will show mercy, exempt the land tax that should be paid from the rent, and appropriately reduce the rental rate, so that the tens of thousands of farmers in our seventh district will be infinitely grateful. Respectfully submitted by the farmers of the seventh district of Changshu County.

Strange Encounter of an Apprentice

### Picking up a Piece of Candy, Eating It, Becoming Mute

Editor: Yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m., Zhu Yuexiang, an apprentice from our shop, was delivering rice to Fuxu Fang on Hede Road. At the entrance of the alley, he encountered an old man with a short stature and a beard as white as snow, reaching to his abdomen. The old man was holding candy in both hands and met Zhu at the entrance of the alley. At this time, the old man accidentally dropped a piece of candy next to Zhu's feet. Zhu immediately told the old man, "Old man, you dropped your candy!" The old man turned around, looked at him, and said, "It's okay, pick it up and eat it, this candy is very sweet." After saying that, he left the alley. So Zhu picked it up, saw that the candy was lovely and red, and swallowed it. After eating it, his throat felt slightly painful, but he didn't mention it when he returned to the shop. Who knew that when he got up this morning, he had lost his hearing and could not speak. The shop owner was extremely anxious when he saw this, and after inquiring in detail about what had happened yesterday, he was shocked. Thinking that if children throughout the city were careless, they would be subjected to the evil plans of bad people, we are sending this letter to be published in your esteemed newspaper to warn future generations and to prevent such occurrences early. If a good doctor in Shanghai is able to treat him, we hope that they will come to our shop and relieve Zhu of his lifelong suffering. The merits will be immeasurable! Respectfully submitted by Shengchang Rice Store, No. 69 Hede Road.
