After detailed research by the Four Joint Offices, it has now been decided that if the raw materials and finished products for industrial and mining loans are insufficient to provide as collateral, machinery recognized by the office can be used as partial collateral, but real estate and other immovable property cannot be used as collateral. The new methods for providing collateral for industrial and mining loans as approved by the office are copied below: (1) Industrial and mining loans shall use raw materials, material finished products, and semi-finished products as collateral. The discount rate shall be determined by the Four Joint Offices from time to time based on market conditions and the nature of the collateral. (2) If the collateral listed in the preceding paragraph is insufficient to provide as collateral, machinery that has been put into operation or has a definite plan for operation, meets manufacturing standards, and has been approved and recognized by the Four Joint Offices can be used as part of the collateral, with a maximum component of 50%. The discount rate is as follows: 1. Newly purchased machinery with a working age of no more than three years shall be pledged at 50% of the purchase price; 2. Existing machinery with a working age of no more than ten years shall be pledged at 40% of the estimated value; 3.

### Measures Agreed Upon by the Provisional Headquarters to Save the Hankou Commerce and Industry

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 24th] The economic market in Hankou has always been outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Recently, with the rise of speculative capital, legitimate merchants have been subject to exploitation by usurious loans, resulting in a series of debt disputes. Large households possessing speculative capital are mostly reluctant to lend, resulting in extraordinarily tight credit in the last half month. Various businesses that rely on borrowing for operations are closing down due to losses. According to reliable investigation, as of today, a total of 117 businesses in the city have closed down. The ratio between the total value of inventory and the total amount of loss is approximately one to ten. Among them, there are also not a few business owners who have fled to escape punishment.

Those who pass the review and examination shall be granted a doctoral degree by the college or university after being approved by the Ministry of Education."

Then, it was discussed to request the government to instruct the Academy to be responsible for preparing the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius' birth, i.e., 1950, and to request the government to instruct the representatives of our country attending the General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in November of this year to formally propose inviting the General Assembly to hold a meeting in China in 1950. Fu Sinian opposed this proposal. Fu stated: "The year and month of Confucius' birth are actually unresolved historical questions. It is problematic for us to suddenly determine that 1950 is the 2,500th anniversary of his birth. I truly admire Confucius' greatness, but there are also aspects of his doctrines that I do not fully agree with." Hu Shi expressed his opinions from the opposite standpoint. It was resolved that: (1) The case of commemorating the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius' birth shall be handed over to the next council for discussion; (2) The Ministry of Education will be requested to instruct the representatives of the Chinese delegation attending the General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to formally invite the General Assembly to be held in China in 1950 at the first General Assembly in November of this year.

The review report of the third group, regarding the determination of the powers of the Council and the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, was resolved to be passed in accordance with the review opinions. Regarding the International Council of Scientific Unions, increasing the number of members of its Committee on Science and its Relation to Social Relations by twelve, a proposal to submit candidates was decided to nominate Zhu Kezhen, Weng Wenhao, and Lan Bendong as candidates. The case of inviting our country to send representatives to participate in the 75th anniversary commemorative meeting of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers was resolved to send Councilor Wang Chongyou to participate. All cases were discussed by 6:50 p.m. After Zhu Yitiao delivered a speech, the conference concluded successfully at 7:00 p.m.

Important Resolutions

The important resolutions are attached as follows: (1) Regarding the proposal to cooperate with various universities, it was resolved to allow full-time researchers to teach a course related to their research field at the university, with no more than four hours of teaching per week. When necessary, the university may request full-time researchers from the Academy to teach a course in their specialty for one semester or one academic year. (2) Regarding the Ministry of Education's letter requesting the establishment of a Legal Research Institute in advance, it was resolved to postpone the establishment due to financial difficulties. (3) Regarding the case of granting doctoral degrees, after seeking the opinions of several institutes, it was resolved that the Council believes that the doctoral candidate's usual research work and doctoral dissertation should be approved by the government, established a research institute for more than five years, and universities or independent colleges that have been specially permitted to accept doctoral candidates shall conduct their own review and examination. Those who pass the review and examination shall be granted a doctoral degree by the college or university after being approved by the Ministry of Education. (4) Regarding the case of the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius in 1950, it was resolved that the Council intends to request the government to instruct the Academy to be responsible for preparing the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius. This case will be reserved for discussion at the next meeting, and the Ministry of Education will be requested to instruct the Chinese delegation attending the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Conference to formally invite the General Assembly to be held in China in 1950 at the first General Assembly in November of this year. (5) Determining the powers of the Academy and the Ministry of Education regarding the review of academic ownership, as a case of division of authority, it was resolved that Councilors Weng (Wenhao) and Sa (Bendong) are authorized to consult with the Ministry of Education on the matter. (6) Nominating candidates for the Committee on Science and its Relation to Social Relations of the International Council of Scientific Unions, it was decided to nominate Mr. Weng Wenhao, Mr. Sa Mudong, and Mr. Zhu Kezhen as candidates.

### After Thirteen Years of Accumulated Hatred, the Enemy is Captured Today: The Main Culprit of the Tragic Massacre in Pingdingshan Village, Fushun, Kubo, is Arrested; Over Three Thousand Villagers Were Killed at the Time

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] The elders of Northeast China have accumulated hatred in their hearts, and the tragic massacre in Pingdingshan Village, Fushun, which occurred in 1933 (Republic of China Year 22), is still infuriating. The main culprit, Kubo, etc., have been arrested by the Japanese Nationals Prisoner of War Administration here and will soon be transferred to the Northeast Provisional Headquarters War Crimes Tribunal for trial. The course of events in this case is as follows: A Japanese shop near Fushun was attacked by volunteer soldiers. Afterwards, part of the shop's goods was discovered in Pingdingshan Village. The Japanese army then massacred over three thousand people in the entire village. Only twenty-seven people survived. Tang Juwu, who was only seven years old at the time and was injured but not killed, and seven other witnesses are now coming to Shenyang to testify to avenge their fathers and brothers.

### Traitor Yin Rugeng's Trial Concluded Yesterday; The Prosecutor Enumerated Crimes and Requested the Death Penalty; The Life or Death of the Veteran Traitor to be Decided on the 31st

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Veteran traitor Yin Rugeng underwent his fifth trial at the Capital High Court on the 24th. At 10:30 a.m., President Zhao Chen, along with Presiding Judge Ge Zhiqin, Jin Shiding, Prosecutor Wang Wenjun, and Clerk Hu Hanbin, entered the court. Yin Rugeng was wearing a gray silk robe and black cloth shoes. His face was fleshy and his hair was white, but he looked flustered. Especially when President Zhao pressed him closely with a solemn tone, revealing his fear of death, Yin Rugeng was stammering, making mistakes, and was at a loss, which was laughable and pitiable. After questioning his age and background, the court first stated that the favorable evidence he had submitted had been fully investigated, and then read out the handwritten reply from Vice Minister Qi Dechun stating that Yin Rugeng's organization of the pseudo-Jidong government had never obtained the tacit agreement of Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and that there was no contact afterwards; the reply from the Salt Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Finance also proved that Yin Rugeng seized the salt tax of 22 counties in Jidong in 1934 and coerced the Changlu Salt Administration Bureau to obtain a huge sum of four million yuan. Then, in turn, he was strictly interrogated for his crimes of organizing a pseudo-regime, issuing counterfeit currency, promoting enslavement education, assisting smuggling, using air force bases, private armed forces, and military yamen mineral deposits to plan to repair the Grand Canal and plot to respond to the "Greater East Asia Holy War". Yin Rugeng either evaded, denied, or quibbled. The debate began at 12:30 p.m. After enumerating his crimes, the prosecutor said: "Throughout the country, even a three-foot-tall child knows that Yin Rugeng is a veteran traitor and should be sentenced to death by the court." Upon hearing this, Yin Rugeng's expression changed drastically, his face turned pale, his whole body trembled, and he frequently wiped his eyes with his sleeves. He then defended himself in a trembling voice, claiming that he "sacrificed himself and jumped into the fire pit to preserve the vitality of the country and buy time", and that "after being arrested by the Japanese, he did not intend to take office again, but was forced to do so!" He also cunningly claimed that "if no one had been willing to sacrifice at that time and had broken with Japan abruptly, there would not be today's situation. He believed that the prosecutor's words were based on the current situation and discussing the facts of that year, and were mostly speculation." Then, lawyer Zhang Shizhao stood up to defend him. Mr. Zhang, with his qualifications as the former Hebei-Chahar Political Council, spoke from personal experience, saying that the government was pursuing a two-faced policy at the time, and Mr. Song Zheyuan endured humiliation and suffered terribly. Yin Rugeng's actions were also a result of the situation, and he hoped that the court could divide Yin Rugeng's behavior into two parts for trial based on the July 7th Resistance War. Lawyer Zhang Wenbo added further remarks. Around 2:00 p.m., the court ordered the debate to end, and the sentence was set for the 31st, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Hu Shi Talks Freely About World Affairs; Expresses Optimism About the Overall Situation at Home and Abroad

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Hu Shi, who came to Nanjing to attend the Academia Sinica Council, received reporters on the 23rd and expressed optimism about the world and domestic situation, repeatedly saying, "I am not pessimistic at all!"

The International Situation Should Not Be Pessimistic

Mr. Hu believes that the world situation is "not bad," as this war was an unprecedented war in human history. It has only been a little over a year since the enemy surrendered, and it is impossible to restore everything to its original state in this short period of time. The situation should be the same abroad. For example, the United States still feels a lack of meat, and strikes are on the rise. When I (Hu speaking of himself) went to England last year to participate in the World Literary Conference, our delegation stayed in a hotel in London that had not seen an egg for three weeks; however, countries such as Britain and the United States have taken measures to a considerable extent, so the people are not suffering too much. For example, in the United States, rent has not increased by a single cent in four years. I was afraid that the new location of the US Embassy in the United States would be taken by someone due to the housing shortage, so I voluntarily increased the rent, but the US government would not allow the landlord to accept it. The postwar situation in various countries is good and bad, but I am not pessimistic about the world situation, and I think I shouldn't be pessimistic. Generally speaking, the current situation is better than after the end of the last great war. To this day, almost no country wants to go to war again. At the same time, a new international organization has emerged after the end of World War II. There is indeed constant discord between major countries, but this is a good phenomenon. Bernes, Bevin, and Molotov may not speak politely to each other, but no one wants to break up, and no one wants to demolish the stage. In the last international organization, neither the United States nor the Soviet Union participated, but now all major countries are participating, and countries that truly take aggression as their doctrine, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, have no say, so I am not pessimistic about the international situation at all.

The Domestic Situation Has Improved

Speaking of the domestic situation, Mr. Hu first said: I came here because I was busy with the resumption of work at Peking University, and recently I have been busy with meetings, so I have no time to read the newspapers carefully, so I am not very clear, and he quoted the joke he told in Beiping: "I didn't even know who the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government was." Then he asked the reporter: Who is the chairman of Jiangsu? After learning that it was Wang Maogong, Mr. Hu said: "Very unfamiliar." When asked about his views on national affairs, Mr. Hu said: The situation in our country has also improved compared to the past. When I was in Beiping, the Communist Party representatives there could move freely without interference. When I met Dong Biwu in Beijing, his movements were also not interfered with. This is a new atmosphere and a good phenomenon; in terms of speech, it is also more free than in the past, such as the publication of the Xinhua Daily in Chongqing, which is an example. Mr. Hu also solemnly pointed out: Freedom is a habit and must be gradually cultivated. Tolerance is also a habit and must be gradually cultivated. Now everyone says what they want to say, which is a good thing.

Optimistic About the Future of Academics

Mr. Hu is also optimistic about the future of academics in our country and reiterated his speech at the opening day of the Academia Sinica Council: If the government can provide ten years of stability, academics will definitely make great progress. The situation of university education is also the same. Peking University held examinations in nine places this year (three of which were joint admissions with Tsinghua, Nankai, and other universities). 32,500 people participated, and the results of this examination are sufficient to represent the level of secondary schools across the country. Generally speaking, the results are not only incomparable to those before the Anti-Japanese War, but also inferior compared to the period of the Anti-Japanese War or the period of occupation. The main reason is that students have been selected for broadcasting in the past year, and their lives are unstable, and their studies are bound to decline, which shows the importance of stability to academics; however, the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War have given students rich life experience, making them deeply aware of the difficulty of life and the difficulty of learning. This will also help them in their pursuit of knowledge, so although the current results are relatively poor, as far as I am concerned, I am not very pessimistic.

Will Continue to Engage in Writing in the Future

Mr. Hu also briefly discussed his plans for future writing, saying: Once the school starts and everything is on track, I can handle fewer administrative matters and engage in writing. When asked when the second volume of "History of Chinese Philosophy" could be completed, Mr. Hu first said that the materials had been collected, but it was difficult to determine when to continue writing; later he said that he would abandon the entire book and planned to rewrite it and rename it "History of Chinese Thought" and expressed that he was more interested in specialized research recently; as for the "History of Vernacular Literature", he also planned to rewrite it and rename it "History of Chinese Living Literature".

Finally, the reporter asked him about his thoughts on the departure of Jiang Tingfu, and Mr. Hu repeatedly said: "This is a most regrettable thing." Mr. Hu praised Mr. Jiang highly, but said that Mr. Jiang had said that he planned to take a short rest, and it would be difficult to return to school to teach in the next semester.

### It is Not Easy to Live in the Capital! Landlords Arbitrarily Exploit Regardless of Government Laws; Foreign Embassies Consider Moving to Shanghai or Plan to Reduce Staff

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The lease terms of most houses in the capital have expired, and residents have received notices from landlords or agents increasing rents by several times. A Latin American diplomat rented an embassy residence a year ago for $300 per month, but now the landlord is asking to raise it to $1,000 per month. In addition, the rent for the residence of an employee of the Embassy of Afghanistan is also being asked to be raised from $250 to $3,000. Other members of the diplomatic corps are also encountering the same crisis. Although the authorities have promulgated rent control regulations, restricting the rent of new houses to no more than 20% of the cost and land price, and the rent of old houses to no more than 500 times that of October 1937 (Republic of China Year 26), Nanjing landlords ignore it and arbitrarily exploit it. Some members of the diplomatic corps have considered reducing staff or moving to Shanghai. An ambassador told a United Press reporter that he had recommended to his government to reduce the number of embassy personnel to a minimum and order the remaining personnel to return home. The Nanjing Municipal Government is at a loss as to how to implement the rent control regulations, and even the National Government cannot rationalize or legalize rents. For example, the Central Propaganda Department wanted to rent a hotel in accordance with the prescribed rent to entertain foreign reporters, but could not find one for months, and finally rented a house for 50 million yuan in legal tender per year. The municipal authorities plan to build small and large apartments to solve the housing shortage for civil servants. The National Assembly plans to requisition the dormitories of various universities to solve the accommodation problem for 2,050 representatives.

### British Business Delegation's Receptions in Tianjin

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] The British business delegation to China visited the municipal government's garrison headquarters and the external affairs commissioner's office on the morning of the 24th. The entire delegation attended a banquet hosted by British merchants in Tianjin at noon. In the afternoon at 6:00 p.m., the British consulate held a reception to welcome the delegation and invited our leaders to accompany them.

### Traitor You Yizhao Sentenced to Seven Years

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Capital High Court sentenced You Yizhao, the pseudo-Minister of Transportation, on the 23rd to seven years of imprisonment for colluding with enemy countries and resisting this country, and deprived him of his civil rights for seven years. His property will be confiscated in accordance with the law.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Pseudo-Naval Vice-Minister Li Huiji was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for six years by the Ministry of National Defense Military Law Department at 6:00 p.m. on the 24th.

### Only Specialty in the Eastern Hemisphere: Asbestos Mines Discovered in Hualien Port, Taiwan

[Central News Agency, Hualien Port, 24th] The asbestos mines in Hualien Port (located on the east coast of central Taiwan) are the only specialty in the Eastern Hemisphere. The richness of its reserves is comparable to that of Canada, a world-renowned producing area. There are two producing areas, Fengtian and Ruisui. During the war, the Japanese carried out mining in Fengtian due to military and industrial needs, extracting 500 tons per year. The current reserves can still be mined for 20 years, but it has been suspended. Ruisui has even richer reserves, but has not yet been mined. Preliminary surveys estimate that there are more than 200,000 tons, and the quality is better than Fengtian.

### Mrs. Cripps Left Lanzhou Yesterday; Flew to Shandan for Inspection

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th] Mrs. Cripps and others flew from Lanzhou to Zhangye at 8:00 a.m. on the 24th, and then took a car to Shandan to inspect the Industrial Cooperative Peili School, and are scheduled to return to Lanzhou on the 25th. Before leaving, Mrs. Cripps expressed her gratitude for Chairman Gu's warm reception, saying that the Lanzhou she had personally seen was by no means the backward northwest city she had imagined, and that Lanzhou's construction and progress were admirable. When Mrs. Cripps left Lanzhou on the morning of the 24th, leaders from all walks of life in the area went to the airport to see her off.

### The Central Headquarters of the Youth League Held a Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday

Standing Committee members He Haoruo, Jiang Jingguo, and others attended. The meeting passed resolutions on the reorganization of various departments and the selection of personnel, and on the appointment of Standing Committee member Li Zheng as the leader in charge of the preparation of the Beiping branch of the League and the instructor of the three groups in Hebei, Tianjin, and Beiping.

### Internal Disputes Within the Zhonghe Party

Standing Committee member Li Shaoqi and others published a notice denying You Yongchang as chairman

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch of the 24th] Li Shaoqi and others, members of the Standing Committee of the Extraordinary Conference of the Chinese Zhonghe Party, published a notice in the Jian Guo Daily here on the 24th, denying You Yongchang as the chairman of the Zhonghe Party.

### The International Federation of Red Cross Societies to Hold Administrative Committee Meeting Next Month

I send Zeng Dajun as a representative to attend

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] The International Federation of Red Cross Societies is scheduled to hold an administrative committee meeting in Geneva in late October, and specially telegraphed to invite Chiang Menglin, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society and Vice President of the Federation, to participate. Chiang, due to busy political affairs, specially requested and was approved by the Executive Yuan to send Zeng Dajun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Society and Senior Secretary of the Executive Yuan, to attend as a representative. After the meeting, he will also visit the Red Cross Societies of Britain, France, the United States, and Canada and present a portrait of Chairman Chiang to express his gratitude to the Red Cross Societies of the above countries for their wartime assistance to our country. Mr. Zeng is currently completing the procedures for going abroad and is scheduled to fly to Britain from Hong Kong at the beginning of next month to attend the meeting.

### Editorial: Looking at the World's Future from the Opening Speech

The United Nations General Assembly opened the day before yesterday in New York, the "Capital of the World." Although the world dares not be overly optimistic about the prospects of this UN General Assembly, after hearing President Truman's welcoming speech, infinite hope arose, and the belief that the UN General Assembly would succeed was further strengthened. Summarizing President Truman's speech, there are six main points: First, the UN organization does not focus on solving current problems but on trying to maintain future international peace; second, the United States has an unshakable belief in maintaining peace and is willing to provide all its resources to support the UN organization, and will never return to its previous isolationist attitude; third, UN member states must not use force to interfere with the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of other countries; fourth, any country that launches aggression must be sanctioned by the International Court of Justice. Although this noble principle has been established, it has not completely eliminated the world's fear of future wars, so the United Nations must establish an agreement to take more active and concrete actions so that all countries, large and small, can share reasonable peace; fifth, all of America's goals are aimed at preventing war, seeking genuine peace, and promoting the realization of the Four Freedoms (i.e., the freedoms of speech, religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear advocated by the late President Roosevelt); sixth, the Allied countries should immediately negotiate an agreement to disarm Germany and Japan to ensure that fascism cannot raise its head and engage in aggression again. Therefore, the Allied countries should draft peace treaties with Germany and Japan as soon as possible, which is also urgently needed.

During the Paris Peace Conference, seeing the ups and downs in the Luxembourg Palace and the pessimistic expressions of representatives from various countries, people inevitably felt some emotion about the future of the post-war world. While they urgently sought peace in their hearts and hoped that the UN organization could become an effective tool for maintaining world peace, they did not dare to overestimate its value, and the shadow of the League of Nations often appeared before people's eyes, raising people's vigilance toward the UN organization. However, after hearing President Truman's words, this kind of doubt immediately dissipated, as if gaining a reliable guarantee that the UN organization would never repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations. Although the League of Nations was also a product of the Great War, its purpose was also to promote international cooperation to maintain world peace; however, its nature was completely different from that of the current UN organization. First, although the League of Nations was initiated by the late U.S. President Wilson, no U.S. representative attended the opening ceremony of the League of Nations. No one can deny that this was the League of Nations' fatal wound. Since the United States adopted isolationism, the League of Nations could not become an effective tool for maintaining world peace. Therefore, the failure of the League of Nations was by no means accidental. Second, the Soviet Union remained outside the League of Nations for the first ten years after its establishment. It was not until Japan violated the covenant that the Soviet Union raised the banner of peaceful diplomacy, and Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov stepped into this nominally "Palace of Peace" amidst the applause of representatives from various countries. However, in today's UN organization, not only are the United States and the Soviet Union both participating, but they have both become the two major pillars of the UN organization. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson welcomed representatives from various countries, saying, "The United States has integrated its consistent foreign policy into the UN organization." Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also said after arriving in New York: "The Soviet delegation is sure to make a contribution to this UN General Assembly, so that it can complete its work to promote the interests of peace and the welfare of the people of all countries in the world." Therefore, with the full support of the United States and the Soviet Union, the UN organization will surely complete its task of maintaining world peace, without a doubt.

Although President Truman's speech did not involve U.S.-Soviet relations, his call for all countries of the United Nations to work together to seek peace certainly included the Soviet Union. This newspaper's editorial on the 23rd pointed out that the focus of today's world political situation lies entirely on U.S.-Soviet relations, and the key to the success or failure of the UN General Assembly also lies entirely on U.S.-Soviet relations. British Prime Minister Attlee also gave a speech in the House of Commons the day before yesterday, emphasizing the necessity for the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to cooperate in order to avoid the catastrophe of a third world war. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes also recently stated that the American people have extended a hand of friendship to the Soviet Union. This makes us even more convinced that the only way to prevent a third world war is through close cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since President Truman said that all of America's goals are aimed at preventing a third world war, the United States will redouble its efforts to obtain the friendship of the Soviet Union. At the same time, we believe that although the United States and the Soviet Union are two completely different countries in terms of ideology and system, one being a capitalist democracy and the other being a socialist Soviet state, at present, whether for the sake of the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union themselves, or for the future of the entire world, they should work together to maintain world peace. War is not only the destruction of the world, but also a catastrophe for both the United States and the Soviet Union, which is harmful and useless to both sides. Therefore, the UN General Assembly is being held in New York in an atmosphere full of peace and light, and it is entirely possible for politicians from both the United States and the Soviet Union to act with great wisdom and benevolence, abandon prejudices, dispel suspicions, and reconcile. I remember that when Molotov arrived in New York, he said: "I believe that sincerity and goodwill will surely lead to mutual understanding, and any difficulties can be solved easily." We are looking forward to the United States and the Soviet Union being able to seek mutual understanding with sincerity and goodwill and sweep away the current international haze.

Recently, the political situation in the United States has also caused a great uproar due to the rift between Secretary of Commerce Wallace and Secretary of State Byrnes in foreign policy. Although the Secretary of Commerce has been succeeded by Harriman, a loyal follower of the late President Roosevelt, the outside world is still skeptical about whether President Truman will continue to adhere to Roosevelt's legacy. It could not be eliminated, but after listening to President Truman's words the day before yesterday, "America's goals are aimed at preventing war, maintaining true world peace, and promoting the realization of the Four Freedoms," we can rest assured completely, and can believe that the current U.S. foreign policy is following the path indicated by the late President Roosevelt and moving toward the goal of these Four Freedoms. All foreign accusations, either that the United States harbors imperialist ambitions or that the United States uses financial diplomacy to achieve certain goals, can be refuted without being attacked and really do not need to be refuted again.

Although the pace of the post-war world towards peace is very slow, and countless international conferences have been held in the past year and a half, the result is only the formulation of five draft peace treaties; however, this little achievement is enough to encourage the world. The future of peace is still bright and splendid, and the second step is to create peace with Germany and Japan. President Truman also bluntly pointed out that the two countries should establish an agreement immediately. Therefore, we hope that when the four foreign ministers hold a meeting in New York on November 4 to discuss the German issue, everyone can seek mutual understanding with sincerity and goodwill, reduce differences of opinion to the minimum, and then establish a peace treaty with Germany; then create peace with Japan, so that the post-war world can return to normal as soon as possible.

In short, President Truman's welcoming speech is enough to inspire people of all countries with confidence in peace, and at the same time, the tense situation between the United States and the Soviet Union can gradually ease as a result, ushering in a beautiful prospect for the current international situation; however, whether this prospect can be realized and not shattered will depend on whether politicians from the United States and the Soviet Union can match their words with deeds. May the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union improve from now on!

### Concrete Arrangements for Disaster Relief in Northern Jiangsu Determined: Landlords Strictly Prohibited from Evicting Tenants and Demanding Back Rent; Reconstruction of the Telecommunications Network in Recovered Areas Actively Underway

[Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper on the 24th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that the counties in northern Jiangsu have just been successively recovered and that the people's minds are often turbulent after the turmoil, telegraphed all commissioners and county magistrates on the 23rd to strictly prohibit landlords from arbitrarily evicting tenants and demanding back rent.

[News from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] The villages and towns in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu are dilapidated and miserable after the robbery. The Jiangsu Construction Department, the Provincial Social Affairs Department, the Xingzong Su-Ning Branch, and the China Farmers Bank and other relevant agencies, in view of this, yesterday specifically consulted on disaster relief measures. Regarding wheat seeds, the Su-Ning Branch will exchange 100 tons of flour for wheat seeds to distribute to farmers, so as not to affect the farmers' winter plowing needs. As for rice seeds, the China Farmers Bank will provide a loan of 1.5 billion to purchase and lend them. Agricultural tools and plowing cattle will also be purchased and distributed to various counties by the China Farmers Bank with a loan of 2.1 billion for farmers to use. Regarding fertilizer, it is planned to apply for 100 tons from the Agricultural Rehabilitation Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, so that the disaster victims after the robbery can wake up as soon as possible.

[News from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] Since the canal line in northern Jiangsu was opened, the refugees who fled here have all celebrated that the hope of returning home is in sight and have made plans to return. Now, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has specially prepared a special ship starting from the 23rd to go directly to Huaiyin, which can be reached in a total of three days. The first day will dock at Shaobo, the second day at Shiying, and the third day will reach Huaiyin. The fare for ordinary passengers is 10,700 yuan, and refugees holding refugee certificates will receive an 80% discount.

### Suzhou and Wuxi Strengthen Public Security: Principal Culprits in Two Robbery Cases in Suzhou to Be Executed First; Those in Wuxi Who Fail to Register Households to Be Dealt with According to the Law

[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper] In recent days, lawless thugs have been active inside and outside Suzhou City, and robbery cases have occurred repeatedly, even in broad daylight, without the slightest fear. The Suzhou City Defense Headquarters specially convened the heads of relevant units such as the local administrative police, military police, and self-defense forces on the 23rd to hold a symposium. Detailed discussions were held on improving the Baojia organization, adding street lights in the alleys, and opening door lights in the shops. It was also decided to extend the curfew hours, increase the police and military strength, and the personnel on duty at the city gates. The Winter Prevention and Security Conference will be held again on the 28th of this month to discuss winter prevention measures. As for the 11 bandits including Li Shiyong, Zhang Rong, and Chen Yiping who robbed Ge Yunbin's house at No. 45 Qiaosikong Alley in the city a few days ago, and the three habitual bandits Zhang Genhai, Zhang Fulin, and Zhang Aban who were previously arrested by the military police for robbing Chen Weigang, the chief of Tingxiang Township in Xijinqiao Town, the reporter inquired the person in charge of the City Defense Headquarters about the disposal measures. It was heard that the headquarters decided to execute the principal culprits in the two cases first within days in order to deter others, and then report the cases to the higher authorities.

[Report from Wuxi by this newspaper] The Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, in view of the fact that the bandits in the Jiangnan area have now been largely suppressed and that only a few remnant bandits are lurking in various places, which can be annihilated in one fell swoop in a short period of time, convened the heads of various agencies on the 22nd to hold the first public security meeting, which was presided over by Chief of Staff Mao Sen. It was resolved that: (1) Those who fail to report their household registration will be punished for obstructing public security; (2) An investigation team will be organized to investigate the location, number, number of people, family members, and housing of military agencies stationed in Wuxi; (3) There are many scattered soldiers and vagrants inside and outside the city.

The police bureau should organize a car patrol team, and the parachute team should organize a riding patrol team. Foreign ships should be ordered to be inspected by the water police team.

### Notorious Bandit Xu Guoliang Executed in Pingwang

At noon on the former day, a Suzhou-Changzhou bus of the Xihu Company was driving from Changshu to Suzhou when three bandits (two in military uniforms and one in Zhongshan suits) who had boarded the bus beforehand suddenly showed box guns, ordered the driver to stop, and began to loot. After half an hour, a small car driving from Suzhou to Changzhou passed by and was also robbed. After a while, they took the small car to the vicinity of Likou in Suzhou, got out of the car and escaped. Among them, two bandits, Xun Hong and Huang Youlin, were eventually intercepted by the self-defense forces at Taiping Bridge in Suzhou. Two sets of military uniforms left in the car have been reported by the Nanmen Police Station here to the General Bureau for verification.

[Report from Fuliang by this newspaper] In the western countryside of Qimen County, southern Anhui, adjacent to the border, a Big Knife Society has recently been discovered. It is active in the Zhuyuan Pancun area. The society uses "Tianyun" as its year title and attracts ignorant people, claiming that those who join the society cannot be invaded by knives, guns, water, or fire, and can eat without producing. Not a few suffering people have been misled into joining, which is a hidden danger to the local area in the future.

### Zhejiang Province's Construction Plan Proceeding Miserably: Work-Relief Obligatory Labor Being the Main Force; Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference Actually a "Flour and Noodle Conference"

[Report from Hangzhou on the 24th by this newspaper] The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference has ended. The discussion on various construction plans was quite detailed, but because it was affected by the deficit finance, the great plans could not succeed as desired. A commissioner smiled and told the reporter that this water conservancy and transportation conference was actually a "Flour and Noodle Conference". All the plans are based on national compulsory labor and Xingzong flour. Without the work-relief flour, everything will be stagnant! This is a very abnormal phenomenon. Director Pi of the Zhejiang Construction Department went to Beijing to consult with the central government on ways to improve the situation in order to relieve the province's financial situation. During this trip, Pi will also ask the China Farmers Bank to approve the appropriation of 1 billion yuan of Zhejiang Province's fishing loans. Last winter, Zhejiang Province requested the United General Office to allocate 500 million yuan of fishing loans, and it was not until this year that it was approved to allocate 35 million yuan. There are a total of 26,000 fishing boats in the province, and each boat only gets more than 1,300 yuan. During the fishing season this year, Zhejiang Province requested the allocation of 4 billion yuan of fishing loans, which is still awaiting Pi's direct negotiation with the United General Office.

### Lakeside Desolate, Paradise Bleak

[Report from Hangzhou on the 24th by this newspaper] Prices in Hangzhou have soared recently, and civil servants and teachers are lamenting their suffering. The new standards have been set but not issued, and silver loans are nominally relaxed but secretly tightened, resulting in rampant usury. The market is becoming more and more bleak. Department stores are the first to bear the brunt. More than 20 stores have closed down because they cannot maintain their operations. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian originally placed the greatest hope on the prosperity of West Lake. The autumn wind is rustling, and there are few tourists. Boatmen and boat women gather to bask in the sun, and the lake is desolate.

### Suzhou Rice Market Plunges, Flour Far Exceeds the Price Limit

[Report from Suzhou on the 24th by this newspaper] After Provincial Chairman Wang personally came to Suzhou to suppress and stabilize the situation of food grains, the situation of rice has become more and more normalized. The situation of hoarding and manipulating has disappeared, and the goods arriving from the countryside are surging, and the market is full of samples. Yesterday, white rice in the market had fallen by five levels, and the opening price was 48,000 yuan. The prices of other early rice and japonica rice have fallen across the board. However, the flour market is chaotic and the black market is rampant. The future evolution is extremely serious. Yesterday, Qidai Double Peach rushed to 21,000 yuan, exceeding the price limit by as much as 5,000 yuan.

[Report from Wuxi] The land tax in this county will be collected immediately. The land tax registers have been ordered by the County Land and Food Bureau to be rushed to completion overnight and submitted to the county for review.

After deducting the 25% rent reduction, the rent amount to be paid per mu is five dou and four sheng and four he; (2) if one-fourth of the 25% rent reduction last year has not been reduced, it should be based on last year's standard. The rent that has been received and exceeds the standard should be deducted and returned; (3) each dou is calculated at 15 city catties.

### Jue-Character Seawall in Danger; No News of Emergency Repairs After the Dyke Engineering Bureau's Survey; Ninghai People Urge Again

[Report from Haining] The "Jue" character seawall outside the South Gate of this county is in danger, and cracks have suddenly appeared in Doujiatou, which has been urged by local people and Xiangdang. Ling Hua, the county magistrate of this county, has also telegraphed the province to send personnel for emergency repairs. The reporter recently visited the county government on this matter. It was reported that Chief Engineer Feng of the Engineering Bureau had visited for a survey on the 22nd, but there is still no news of emergency repairs. The people of this county are making another emergency appeal because they are afraid that if it is washed away once the autumn tide is high these days, it will be unimaginable. The rapid repairs are urgent.

[Another dispatch] The county government received an order from the province yesterday, according to the report of the Emergency Seawall Repair Project Office, that the results of the emergency seawall repairs in various sections were best in Haining, Dangyang, and Tonglu counties. The county magistrates and construction section chiefs of Haining and Haiyan worked very hard to collect civilian workers, so that the entire project could be completed quickly. The Ministry clearly commended them as follows: The county magistrate of Haining County should be given a major merit once. Bo Fuyang Tongchang and the former county magistrate of Fuyang, and the construction section chiefs of Haiyan and Haining should each be given a merit once. The county magistrates of Yuhang, Pinghu, and Jiashan counties should be given commendations.

### Reforming the Weak Literary Atmosphere: Suzhou Promotes Exercise

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 24th] Major General Ma Shigong, the paratrooper commander stationed in Suzhou and commander of city defense, has been stationed in Suzhou for two months. Observing that the people of Suzhou are physically weak and lack understanding of fitness and hygiene, which will be detrimental to the future of the nation, he has formulated a concrete plan to initiate the organization of a Committee for Promoting Exercise from All Circles in the county. He is calling on enlightened members of society to jointly support this effort.

### Chongming Towns and Villages Establish Self-Defense Forces

[Our Newspaper, Chongming Dispatch] Since the restoration of the county, scattered soldiers and vagrant troops have filled the villages, causing disturbances everywhere. Public order has been greatly disrupted. Subsequently, national troops stationed themselves to suppress the unrest, working with the security team day and night to suppress and arrest perpetrators.

Recently, the county government, in order to adapt to the current needs, establish permanent public order, and prevent bandit intrusions, has ordered all towns and villages to organize civilian self-defense forces, and coordinate with patrol teams to provide night-long security. All coastal ports are under strict guard.

### Ningbo Prepares for Waterworks: Shanghai-Based Gentry Invite Experts to Conduct Surveys

[Our Newspaper, Ningbo Dispatch] Liu Hongsheng and Li Shuxiong, gentry from Ningbo residing in Shanghai, in order to prepare for the construction of the Ningbo waterworks project, invited Mr. Bowen and Mr. Pullen, hydraulic engineers from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Mr. Yang Kuanlin, dean of the St. John's University Engineering School, to Ningbo on the 20th of this month. They were accompanied by Mr. Chen Ru and Mr. Zhou Xinbai to conduct an on-site survey. After arriving in Ningbo, they frequently met with Commissioner Yu of the Sixth District and County Magistrate Chen, who both expressed strong support. They then appointed Ni Weixiong of the telephone company and Wang Dianzhang, head of the construction section, to discuss the matter with the American engineers. Whether the water source should be taken from the Yuyao River or from Dongqian Lake requires serious study. So, the next morning, they went to Dongqian Lake to inspect the water source and conduct some preliminary surveys. In the afternoon, they returned to Ningbo and inspected the Yuyao River again, also proposing to build a dam to store fresh water. The complete detailed plan will be studied in detail after returning to Shanghai. Reporter's note: The plan to establish waterworks in Ningbo dates back ten years, during the tenure of County Magistrate Chen Baolin. However, it was abandoned due to insufficient funds and manpower. This time, the old plan is being revived. If it is realized, it will truly be a blessing for the people of Ningbo.

### Zaozhuang Coal Mine Fortunately Preserved: Communist Troops Caused Extensive Damage During Their Retreat; Workers, Recognizing the Importance of the Greater Good, Risked Their Lives to Rescue It

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou Dispatch] The former "New Fourth Army" 7th Division, 20th Brigade, and 21st Brigade, totaling approximately 20,000 men stationed in Zaozhuang, held a meeting on October 7th and decided to completely blow up the two generators and electric boilers at the Zaozhuang coal mine that could not be transported away, and to burn down all the buildings as much as possible. The workers pleaded for the preservation of the facilities, but to no avail. At 8:00 AM on the 8th, the mine's No. 3 4,000-kilowatt generator was blown up. At 9:30 AM, the No. 2 2,000-kilowatt generator was blown up, and all the buildings in the mine were also destroyed. The head of the Communist workers' detachment also placed a large landmine under the power plant and lit the No. 2 boiler. At this time, the rapid transport troops of the National Army had surrounded the Zhangzhuang area five miles north of Zaozhuang. The Communist troops fled in panic, and workers Chen Zhaowen, Zhao Wenlin, and more than 30 others seized the opportunity to remove the landmine. When the Communist cadres returned to the power plant to search for it, a certain regiment of the National Army suddenly entered the area and captured more than 50 people, including Zhang Fulin. When the workers saw the National Army entering Zaozhuang to provide comfort, the citizens were a hundred times more excited. They automatically pieced together and installed the remaining damaged parts and worked hard to repair the No. 1 generator to prevent flooding. By 4:00 PM on the 10th, the power plant was able to generate electricity and pump water. By 5:00 PM, all the lights in the mine were on. By 3:00 PM on the 11th, the Chen-appointed receiving committee for the mine sent more than ten people, including Chief Coal Engineer Lu, to Zaozhuang to supervise the repairs. The current pumping rate has reached 16 tons per minute, and the water level can be lowered by five or six inches per minute. It is estimated that the water can be completely pumped out in three months. There are currently more than 100,000 tons of coal stored in the mine, which is sufficient for the complete restoration of the mine. The technicians Chen Zhaowen, Zhao Wenlin, Zhang Xigui, and more than 30 others, who cared for the mining area and bravely carried out repairs, have reportedly been recommended by the General Labor Union for commendation by the Ministry of Social Affairs.

Questioning the Rejection of Public Treasury Checks

I am a civil servant in the rural area of this city and also handle administrative work. Due to my duties, I often have to deal with ordinary merchants, which causes a lot of trouble. The most troublesome thing is the public treasury checks. I have to beg and plead repeatedly before they are willing to accept them or put a stamp on the back of the check. For example, recently I went to Fufeng Paper Company on Zhongzheng East Road and asked them to stamp the checks for transactions in August and September. Not only were they unwilling, but they said contemptuously, "Our company doesn't accept public treasury checks. We don't want to do this kind of business at all. Why didn't you come to get it stamped back then?" Sir! The public treasury system was not created by us, and it also gives us a headache. For example, this month's expenses need to be issued at the end of the month or even at the beginning of the next month. Except for salaries and petty cash, all checks must be stamped with the store's seal before they can be withdrawn. Our agency is more than 30 li from Shanghai, and it costs a lot of money to come to Shanghai. Going to the city bank that acts as the public treasury also requires submitting to the resident auditing personnel for review. If you're unlucky, you have to wait for two hours to get the money. Therefore, we collect invoices for two or three months and ask the merchants to stamp them, which is also our helpless plight! Now, this situation has forced me to raise the following two questions and ask the relevant authorities for instructions:

(1) Is it reasonable for merchants to refuse to accept public treasury checks? What legal remedies are available? Can the police be asked to enforce the system (since the public treasury system is promulgated by national law)?

(2) If purchases this month must be paid with this month's checks, then we can only ask the financial and accounting authorities to issue regular expenses at the beginning of each month. Otherwise, we dare not even advance the money, because the merchants will not stamp the check after the time has passed! (Hao Ruo)

Please Expedite the Issuance of Victory Commemorative Medals

The most glorious page in the history of our country, the victory against Japan, can be said to be famous for all time and immortal! The price paid for this historical achievement was that our soldiers used our heads and shed hot blood, fought hard on the battlefields, fought north, south, east, and west, and suffered all kinds of hardships! In the past eight years, only our soldiers have tasted this kind of suffering, which everyone can agree on.

The government made and issued "Victory Against Japan Commemorative Medals" and "Orders of Merit" to reward meritorious personnel. Although we have no special meritorious performance, we have never left the army in the past eight years of the war. We have marched tens of thousands of miles, climbed mountains and waded through water, slept in the open and ate in the wind, and faced gunfire and rain of bullets. We can also call ourselves the honorable name of "Anti-Japanese Soldiers", and we are not boasting.

Last month, our team reported to receive this commemorative medal, but it can only be issued to those who have been appointed and served in battle by the Ministry of Personnel. Otherwise, it is not possible. We have all been appointed and served in positions, even repeatedly. The roster has been submitted to apply for the medal for almost a month, but there has been no news so far. We are now retired and about to return to our hometown. However, after participating in the eight-year war of resistance abroad, if we return to our hometown this time without any performance of anti-Japanese identity, we will feel ashamed! We respectfully ask the authorities to quickly issue the "Victory Against Japan Commemorative Medal" as soon as possible! (Retired Officers of the 49th Company of the 7th Battalion of the 17th Regiment of the Central Training Corps)

### UN General Assembly Begins General Debate: Shortening Speaking Time, Can Conclude in Four Days; Soviet Union Opposes Amendments Despite Five Powers' Veto Power

[Reuters, Flushing, New York, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly, which officially opened yesterday, began general affairs today. Assembly President Spaak called on all representatives to shorten their speeches, so it is expected that the general debate can be concluded in four days. Then the six main committees will begin to deal with the world's major problems. In today's debate, any representative can speak on any topic they choose. The terms of the three Council seats of Mexico, Egypt, and the Netherlands on the Security Council will expire at the end of this year. The Assembly will elect their successors. The highest-rated candidates are Belgium, Colombia, and Syria. Molotov's warm response to President Truman's appeal has given many representatives hope that the East-West rift can be eliminated. Diplomats also feel that international resolutions can be established through harmonious opinions, without having to go through the path of voting and vetoing. However, some representatives feel that the Soviet Union may allow Yugoslavia or another small country to join the Security Council in order to strengthen the Slavic group's power in the Security Council together with Poland.

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th, United Press] After Truman delivered his wise words at the United Nations General Assembly, he returned to Washington at midnight. After the opening ceremony of the General Assembly, the Soviet Union began to fight those who wanted to change the five powers' veto power. Today, Caolotov warned other major countries that the Soviet Union was prepared to demand that the Assembly or the committee reject a full debate on the veto issue. Ancient, Phi, Australia, and other countries outside the five powers are striving for the complete abolition of the veto power or explicitly stipulating restrictions on its use in the Charter. If the Soviet Union succeeds in preventing the debate on the veto power in the 14-nation committee, the efforts of countries such as Cuba will be in vain. At an informal meeting of the committee last night, Soviet representative Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union opposed five provisions in the General Assembly's provisional motion, all of which were related to the veto power. Vyshinsky's opposition failed to gain the support of the United Kingdom and the United States. In his speech yesterday, Dumen clearly stated that the United States supports full discussion of the veto power, and even amending the veto power. British Prime Minister Attlee also expressed his support in the House of Commons for reviewing the veto power to make it consistent with the original intention of those who drafted the Charter. Today, the Soviet capital's radio station attacked Attlee as an "enemy of peace" because he was seeking restrictions on the veto power. Cuba proposed convening a meeting of representatives from 52 countries to remove the provisions on the veto power from the Charter. Vyshinsky opposed this move and tried to prevent it from being included on the agenda.

### Chairman Spaak Describes the Main Purpose of the General Assembly

Cultivating Mutual Understanding and Virtues, Jointly Promoting Major Tasks

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd, Special Dispatch] Spaak, Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly, stated the main purpose of the General Assembly at the General Assembly and jointly and enthusiastically called on other representatives to find ways to enhance and generate a "common international spirit" and cultivate the "virtue of mutual understanding," and to take both as the starting point of this world organization, thereby promoting its important responsibilities. The short and concise Foreign Minister Spaak also frankly stated that there are still many obstacles to the future of international cooperation, but these obstacles can be overcome. He further explained that our goals are the same, but our reactions and methods of thinking and discussion are often difficult to be permanently consistent. There are differences in race and temperament between us, so conflicts sometimes occur over direct interests. There are various obstacles to the international future, and it is absurd and dangerous to ignore this. However, these obstacles can hardly be overcome without generosity, wisdom, and absolute necessity.

Mr. Qi also told people around the world that the world's top diplomats have gathered here to "seek a balance of our individual interests." He suggested the following work methods, that is, let us try to work, work not just for empty talk, but to adopt sound methods to achieve concrete results. The result is a clear and true thing, and it is also what the people who are expecting and are anxious about are looking forward to us. We should avoid lengthy general discussions and discuss all issues with an honest, courageous, and agile attitude. Mr. Si also gave a powerful answer to those who doubted the United Nations organization, saying, "Can they suggest any better organization than the United Nations? Are they still not clear about this dilemma, which is actually very simple? If we do not succeed, the world will fall into chaos and eventually lead to war." Previously, Spaak celebrated the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union had both taken active actions in the United Nations, rather than adopting isolationist policies after the First World War. He then expressed his deep gratitude to President Truman for attending the first meeting of the General Assembly and deeply commemorated the achievements of the late US President Roosevelt.

### Our Delegation Attends the General Assembly

Ten Newspaper Reporters Listen In

[Our Newspaper, Special Correspondent, New York, 23rd] The United Nations General Assembly officially opened in New York today. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, arrived here from Washington. He was wearing a gray suit and attended the General Assembly. Representative Guo Taiqi arrived here from Paris on Monday, wearing a black suit, and sat next to Gu. Before the meeting, the two skilled Chinese diplomats had been constantly talking earnestly. Other Chinese representatives, including Vice Minister Liu Zuo, Dr. Zhang Pengchun, and Xie Jinlin, also attended. The seats of the Chinese representatives were arranged in the middle row of the third row. There were ten Chinese newspaper reporters in attendance, including reporters from Chinese-language newspapers published by overseas Chinese.

### Jin Yangrong Sends Letter to Lay: Condemning the Division of Korea

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd, United Press] Jin Yangrong, president of the US-Korean Association, recently wrote to UN Secretary-General Lay condemning the division of Korea into north and south along the 38th parallel, saying that this is a "direct violation of the principles and purposes of the United Nations." He also firmly stated that the United Nations should respect the will of the Korean people.

### The United States Decides to Provide Aid to Italy to Solve Post-War Problems

[United Press, Washington, 24th] US Secretary of State Bernardes telegraphed the new Italian Foreign Minister Nanni today, saying that the American people are determined to fully assist Italy in solving post-war problems, and he is very happy to work to strengthen the close ties between the two countries.

### Scenes from the Meeting: Truman and Molotov Warmly Shake Hands and Congratulate Each Other

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] After President Truman finished his speech at the United Nations General Assembly today, when he walked past Molotov, Mr. Mo greeted President Du in Russian, saying, "Molotov sincerely congratulates the President on his speech. He thinks this speech is very great." Mr. Du replied, "I am very grateful." This was the first time that Molotov and Truman had met again since Molotov attended the United Nations Organization General Assembly last year and passed through Washington to meet with Truman. The opening ceremony was 15 minutes later than scheduled because Chairman Spaak was waiting for the English translation of his opening speech to the General Assembly. The translation of Mr. Lu's speech was placed at the United Nations' temporary headquarters at Success Lake. When a messenger came to pick it up, he argued with the security guards at the door for a while before being allowed to enter the meeting place. The names of the representatives of various countries who attended today's meeting were like an international biographical dictionary, including prime ministers, foreign ministers, and ambassadors, etc. The number of foreign ministers exceeded 20. The only member of the royal family was Prince Faisal, son and foreign minister of the King of Saudi Arabia. Although President Truman was the most prominent figure attending today's meeting, the movements of Bernardes and Molotov were actually attracting more attention. These two are currently the symbols of the so-called East-West group dispute. After the opening of the General Assembly, Molotov left the venue and the Soviet delegation was led by Vice Minister Vyshinsky. Bernerd led the US delegation with Senator Austin. The front row of the meeting place was for the representatives of the three powers, with the United Kingdom first, followed by the Soviet Union, and the United States third. Among the 500 representatives and deputy representatives, there were twelve women representatives. The most famous one was Mrs. Roosevelt. El Salvador sent two women representatives, and the remaining nine countries each sent one woman representative, namely China, India, Paraguay, Dominica, Ecuador, New Zealand, Cuba, Luxembourg, and Panama.

### The Soviet Union Sets Up a Special Committee to Supervise Collective Farms

### The Veto Power of Refugee Trusteeship: A Review of the Four Powers' Policies; There Will Be a Fierce Dispute at the UN General Assembly

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th, Special Dispatch] The success or failure of this United Nations General Assembly depends on the ability of the major powers to coordinate their international policies. The policies of the major powers, mainly, will be expressed in the debates on the three major issues of refugees, trusteeship, and veto power. The following are brief descriptions of the various objectives that the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France want to achieve in the world parliament, based on the current indications. (1) United States: On the veto power, the US delegation will condemn the Soviet Union's abuse of the veto power. The United States will undoubtedly support the application of the veto power, which must be restrained. In terms of trusteeship, the United States will prevent the General Assembly from determining the fate of the former Japanese trust territories currently occupied by the United States before the signing of the Japanese peace treaty. If the United States puts these islands under the rule of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, it is believed that the United States will insist that the United Nations has the power to supervise the trust territories, which may conflict with the Soviet Union's policy, because the Soviet Union may consider obtaining superficial supervisory power over the trust territories and will not welcome it. On the issue of refugees, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly start another debate on the proposed funding of the World Refugee Organization and the right of displaced people to return to their home countries. (2) Soviet Union: On the veto power, the Soviet Union will strongly resist any attempt to abolish or change the veto power. On the issue of refugees, unless the World Refugee Organization refuses to assist Soviet political enemies in United Nations refugee camps, the Soviet Union will not provide economic assistance to refugees. There are two other issues that the Soviet Union will try its best to insist on: one is the withdrawal of US troops from "non-enemy" countries, and the other is the exclusion of Franco's Spain from all United Nations special agencies. (3) United Kingdom: On the refugee issue, it will strongly demand joint action with the United States to immediately establish an international refugee organization to entrust the displaced people in United Nations refugee camps. Regarding trusteeship, the United Kingdom will insist on the early establishment of the Trusteeship Council. Regarding the veto power, the United Kingdom will support the rule of unanimity among the five powers and will suggest that the provisions in the Charter stipulating the veto power be interpreted progressively to avoid its abuse. (4) France: On the veto power, it is believed that France will insist on its veto power. Regarding the issue of trusteeship, France will act as a buffer and mediator when discussing the issue of trusteeship, with the status of being the first to submit a trusteeship agreement to the United Nations. On Franco's Spain, France will support the Soviet Union's position because France is strongly opposed to Franco's Spain joining any United Nations agency.

### Undermining the Yalta Guarantees: Soviet Union Massively Stationing Troops in Eastern Europe; Churchill Raises Startling Questions to the Government

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd, United Press] Churchill, in a speech to the House of Commons today, condemned the Soviet Union for undermining its guarantees made at Yalta and criticized the Soviet Union for maintaining over two hundred divisions of troops in a "wartime footing" in its Eastern European occupation zone. Churchill stated that during Hitler's era, it was easier to sense and predict the general direction of certain events. Today, we do not need to consider how to deal with Hitler and his cruel, anti-Semitic Nazi party, of which anti-Semitism was the core tenet. What we face today is more difficult to grasp than what was openly laid out in "Mein Kampf." What we face today is a collective of ideas whose actions we cannot determine the origin of. In the Kremlin, there are thirteen or fourteen shrewd and capable individuals who hold control over the entire Soviet Union and more than one-third of Europe.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] British opposition leader and former Prime Minister Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons today, questioning whether it was true that two hundred divisions of Soviet troops were stationed in Europe. Political observers believe this is Churchill's cunning plan to force the government into a corner. Undersecretary McNeil narrowly avoided the trap, as if McNeil had replied that the government was unaware of the stationing of such a large army, Churchill would have questioned whether the revelation of this information would change the government's policy. Conversely, if McNeil had admitted that this figure was accurate, Churchill would have questioned whether the government would take countermeasures against such a concentration of forces to prevent armed conflict in Europe. McNeil almost replied that, given the progress of democracy in the Soviet Union, this number was not particularly alarming, but McNeil only stated that although the Soviet Union had a large number of troops stationed in Europe, he was not as pessimistic as Churchill. He also expressed skepticism about the figures mentioned by Churchill.

### British Prime Minister Delivers Speech, Fiercely Criticizing the Communist Party, Saying It Creates Division and Suspicion Between Countries; Worries About the Future of the World Situation

[This Newspaper's Report] London, 24th Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech today at the British Trades Union Congress in Brighton, strongly criticizing the Communist Party. He stated, "Anyone who refuses to accept the orders of the Communist Party is branded as a fascist. Wherever the Communist Party has an advantage, it is considered democracy, and conversely, wherever the Communist Party loses power, it is labeled as fascism. For example, the Greek elections were held under international supervision, and as a result, the anti-communist faction prevailed, and the Communist Party immediately attacked it. On the other hand, the plebiscites held in places where the Communist Party is in power are praised as the sacred will of the people. The Soviet government seems to deliberately want to isolate the Soviet people from other people, which is a pity for the future of the world situation. Soviet newspapers deliberately make untrue propaganda about foreign situations, causing division and suspicion between countries. Some people may think that the Soviet system is most beneficial to workers and should welcome close contact between workers in various countries, but in fact, it goes against it. This policy is regrettable, and we cannot help but hope that the Soviet Union will change it."

### New Labor Strife Erupts Among British Tram Workers; Mayor Sets Deadline of Today to Resume Work; Labor Demands Should Undergo Legal Mediation; Inciters of Labor Strife Ordered Arrested

[This Newspaper's Report] Regarding yesterday's general strike by British tram workers, Mayor Wu met with reporters from various newspapers in the City Hall conference room at 4:30 PM yesterday to report on the facts of the matter and set a deadline for all to resume work this morning. The cause of the British tram workers' strike was the breakdown of negotiations with management. On September 24th of this year, the labor side put forward four demands: (1) Requesting the issuance of children's education expenses, with each employee receiving a loan of 100,000 yuan for tuition. (2) The base salary of the British collection clerks in the company is 40 yuan, while that of the French is 44 yuan, requesting the same treatment as the French tram company. (3) Requesting the adjustment of the Peace Award for drivers and ticket sellers, calculated according to the cost of living index. (4) Internal affairs and machine maintenance department workers requesting the issuance of uniforms. After the above demands were put forward, although negotiations were held repeatedly, no results were achieved. The union held a representative assembly the day before yesterday and decided to openly "invite guests" from 2 PM on the 24th. Unexpectedly, when the trams were dispatched yesterday morning, four workers blocked the trams on all routes, preventing them from leaving the depot, and under their call, a general strike was implemented.

I believe that employees in public service professions should have a spirit of service, and that the British tram company has gone on strike three times in one month over trivial issues, which is extremely unreasonable. The four workers dared to openly block the trams yesterday morning, which is an act that disrupts social order and violates Article 153 of the Criminal Law (anyone who publicly commits one of the following acts through words, pictures, speeches, or other methods shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no more than two years, detention, or a fine of no more than 1,000 yuan: (1) inciting others to commit crimes; (2) inciting others to violate laws or resist lawful orders). I have ordered the police to arrest these four people and send them to court for legal processing. At the same time, the union has been warned that all must resume work from the 25th. Even if negotiations break down, the demands put forward by the labor side should be mediated by the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau. Strikes and "inviting guests" are both illegal actions, he said.

Finally, the mayor solemnly declared: Today's strike atmosphere has lost the sympathy of society. I would like to propose the slogan "Striking is easy, resuming work is difficult." If the British tram company does not resume work tomorrow (i.e., today), it will be considered automatic dismissal. It will not be so easy to ask to resume work in the future. Moreover, the company authorities can review the list of workers, and disruptive elements with bad conduct may not be approved. The above opinions are based entirely on a neutral position and are absolutely not biased, he said.

After the meeting, a reporter asked how to curb the trend of soldiers riding the bus without tickets. Mayor Wu said: A joint announcement will be issued with the Garrison Headquarters to strictly prohibit soldiers from riding without tickets.

Mayor Wu also said: The foreman system at the rice wharves on the Suzhou River in this city is unreasonable. It is said that the handling fee for each bag of rice is 300 yuan, while the foreman must extract 210 yuan, and the workers actually receive only 90 yuan. This kind of cannibalistic system must be improved.

### Lone Army Enters Sihang Warehouse; 10th Anniversary Commemoration Ceremony Held Tomorrow

Tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of General Xie Jinyuan leading the Eight Hundred Warriors into the Sihang Warehouse.

After the victory, only a small number of lone soldiers remained, with no home to return to, and many were old, weak, and disabled, still staying in Shanghai, living a hard life.

### Chairman Fang Receives Industrial and Commercial Circles, Hoping for Sincere Unity

All the members of the Municipal Party Headquarters held a tea party yesterday afternoon at the Sado Ballroom to receive the industrial and commercial circles of this city. More than 150 people attended, including Xu Jiyun, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, all directors and supervisors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and chairmen of various trade associations. First, Chairman Fang gave a speech, stating his hopes for people in the industrial and commercial circles, saying: The development of commerce can improve the general level of culture and is also used to prosper the rural economy and promote international prosperity, so the responsibilities borne by people in the commercial circles are extremely important. However, in the current domestic situation, most factories have stopped production, and production and consumption are fundamentally disconnected. If the country is still like this, it is useless to discuss the development of international trade. The central government definitely has good plans for industry and commerce, but these good resolutions have not been effectively implemented. On the other hand, capitalists with idle funds are unwilling to invest in industry. All of this makes it difficult for industry and commerce to develop. In the future, I hope that the government will sincerely support industry and commerce and effectively implement the established plans. Industry and commerce themselves must also be truly united and take on the responsibility of prospering commerce. Then, Xu Jiyun, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stood up and gave a speech, briefly describing the history of cooperation between the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Party Headquarters in the past. At the same time, he hoped that people in the industrial and commercial circles would recognize the domestic political line and work together to seek the development of industry and commerce. Subsequently, Wang Yansong of the silk and satin industry, Wang Jingdong of the rubber industry, and Tang Zuxiang, a representative of the military uniform industry association, expressed their opinions one after another, all hoping that the government would effectively support industry and commerce, and at the same time expressed their willingness to cooperate sincerely with party headquarters at all levels. Finally, Chairman Fang summarized the opinions of all parties and stood up to give a speech, saying: The Municipal Party Headquarters is determined to maintain close contact with the people, seek happiness for the people, strengthen the Party Headquarters' organization and training of the people, and hopes that people in the industrial and commercial circles will be sincerely united. The tea party ended at around 5 PM.

### A Pair of Stone Figures Beside the Racecourse is About to Say Goodbye; Moller Writes to the Authorities Asking for Them to Be Moved

[This Newspaper's Report] Ever since the American company MGM decided to build the best movie theater in the Far East on the vacant lot at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Bubbling Well Road, the fate of the two stone figures (see picture) living there is about to end. The land was originally the site of Moller & Co., and the two stone figures were originally from the tomb of a certain family in the racecourse. When Moller built a new house in West Bridge, they were moved here as decorations. Unexpectedly, many Chinese people are superstitious and worship them as gods, with the words "Requests are Always Granted" written on them. Incense in front of the stone statues never stops, and many pious pilgrims come from afar; and many grooms who participated in horse racing also go to pray. Therefore, Moller recently wrote to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, requesting that the two figures be moved to the side gate of the racecourse on Mandelane Road, so that the grooms can continue to worship. However, the Bureau of Public Works believes that this facility is obviously promoting superstition, and the gathering of people for worship will hinder traffic and affect the appearance, so it is difficult to approve. In short, this pair of figures will inevitably be moved soon, but where they will be moved is still unknown.

### Robbery and Extortion - Thirteen Young Robbers Arrested in One Day for Numerous Crimes

[Our Report] The Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Bureau apprehended thirteen robbers on the 12th of this month. What is most distressing is that they are all knowledgeable young men in their twenties. Moreover, they are seasoned in this path and have committed numerous crimes. In their last act, they were well aware that the life of an outlaw was not a long-term plan. They changed their appearance, under the guise of an official organization, hoping to defraud a large sum of money and establish a business, changing professions. Unexpectedly, the net of justice is wide, and their treacherous schemes were thwarted, and they were apprehended by the police. On the 11th, the police received a tip that a large group of bandits were hiding at No. 66 Limar Road in the South City. At 00:30 on the 12th, Detective Feng Qishan, Zhang Changgui, and Chen Xianrong, along with officers Zhang Jingyu and Ding Wenjiang, rushed to the scene. They arrested Wang Fuyi, a 23-year-old from Beiping, on the third floor. A pistol and nineteen bullets were found next to the escalator on the third floor. Wang confessed that his accomplices were hiding at No. 1 and No. 4, Lane 891, Huangpi Road. The police proceeded to those addresses. They first arrested Huang Jin at No. 1 and confiscated a pistol.

Flipping Over Roofs in Attempt to Escape, Ultimately Captured

When the police arrived at No. 4, the bandit Wu Debao (age 23, from Ningbo), knowing that their cover was blown, climbed onto the roof from the balcony and fled to the back building of No. 903 South Huangpi Road, hiding under a bed. However, he was eventually discovered by Detective Feng, who bravely captured him. After interrogation at the police station, Huang confessed that the pistol belonged to Xu Xinglou (residing at No. 12, Tianhe Lane, West Gate Road). As dawn was approaching, the police, seeking to round up all the suspects, dispatched some officers to guard the bandits' dens, and rushed to Tianhe Lane. That day, Xu and another accomplice, Zhang Shoubai, were waiting at the home of the victim, Pan Yijun, due to suspicions of extortion related to treason. Only another accomplice, Tang Junhua, was apprehended there. Subsequently, Xu and Zhang were arrested at the home of the victim, Pan Yijun, at No. 18, Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street. Meanwhile, the officers guarding the bandits' dens successively arrested accomplices Chen Zonghao, confiscating a six-round pistol, as well as Geng Ruizhang, Wei Chaohua, Xia Yuren, Huang Ronggen, Ge Shuqi, and Li Ming, totaling thirteen people. According to Wei, another pistol was hidden with Zhang Wenkui, a soldier in the guard of the Fuxing Island Naval Training Camp. The police, along with military police, went there, but Zhang Wenkui had already fled. Only a pistol and five bullets were found in his luggage.

Confessed to Robberies and Extortions - Six Times in Total

After days of investigation by the police, the robbers have confessed to the following robberies: (1) No. 8, Dongping Lane, Caojia Street, Old West Gate, on June 20th; (2) No. 268, Yiding Lane, Jiangsu Road, on September 5th; (3) No. 5, Qingsheng Lane, Zhonghua Road, on September 30th; (4) No. 8, Lane 273, Duolun Road, on September 24th; (5) The home of Zheng Miaoyun, Room 24, Peien Apartments, South Chongqing Road, on October 3rd; (6) No. 5, Hongyefang, Lujiabang Road, on October 6th. There was also a case of intimidation and deprivation of freedom. Because they feared that they would eventually be caught, Xu Xinglou, Zhang Shoubai, Tang Junhua, and others suggested finding another way out. On the 9th of this month, they impersonated an organization, wore firearms, and went to Pan Yijun's place at No. 20, Tongkang Lane, Huasheng Road, accusing Pan of being a traitor and claiming to be under orders to arrest him. Pan's friend, Feng Baoyong, intervened and arranged a negotiation at Guanshengyuan on Jinling Road. There, Xu and the others proposed that if Pan could invest 20 million yuan in their Xinghua Trading Company, they would drop the case. Feng agreed to relay the message and rescheduled the meeting for 8 PM on Double Ten Day at the Paradise Hall on the eighth floor of the Jinmen Hotel. At that time, Pan was unable to raise the large sum and asked Feng to refuse on his behalf. Xu and his accomplices turned their anger towards Feng, and Tang Junhua took Feng back to the bandits' den to be held in custody. Meanwhile, they went to Pan's place, but Pan had already fled. However, they had learned that Pan's wife lived at No. 18, Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street, so Xu and Zhang went there to monitor her movements, intending to wait for her husband. They were arrested by the police who had been tracking them. Among the stolen items from the above robberies, there was a diamond ring weighing 5.20 carats belonging to Zheng Miaoyun, as well as countless gold ornaments, clothing, and cash. Some of the stolen goods have been recovered by the police, and the victims have identified the suspects without error. The entire case will be transferred to the Garrison Command today for legal proceedings.

### Ten Employers in the Fashion Industry Fail to Comply with Settlement Records; No One Summoned to Court Hearing

[Our Report] Employees in the Department Store Group (specializing in shirts and underwear) of the fashion industry in this city requested improved treatment in March of this year, leading to a labor dispute. On March 25th, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs mediated and established a settlement record with the number (three five) Labor Two, number three one seven nine was issued notifying both labor and management to faithfully comply. However, ten employers, including Wang Xingji, Weihua, Qichang, Maoji, Huaxing, Tangsheng, Maosheng, Jiang Fusheng, Huaxiang, and Meiyi, have delayed in fulfilling the various items stipulated in the settlement record. After both parties appealed to the Bureau of Social Affairs again, the bureau continued on June 19th, ordering the fulfillment of the record, but the ten, Weihua and the others, ignored it. The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the ten merchants are disregarding the law, so the entire case was sent to the District Court for enforcement. Yesterday, the Twelfth Civil Division of the District Court heard the case. Because the addresses of the ten merchants were unknown, they were not summoned. The labor representative, Zhang Bochen, appeared in court to respond. After a brief questioning in court, Zhang Bochen was ordered to submit a supplementary complaint, detailing the addresses and names of the employers, as well as the names of the persons in charge of each business. The non-complying businesses will be summoned to court again on the 31st of this month for enforcement.

### The Inside Story of Shanghai's Pickpocketing Gangs (5)

— Huang Jiamou

Taking Items from Pockets as if Plucking Them; Disappearing Without a Trace

When pickpocketing gangs "do business," they usually form small groups of three to five people, often dressed neatly, resembling merchants or students. Places with high foot traffic and crowded passengers are their ideal locations. Seasoned pickpockets can make items disappear from the victim's pockets without their knowledge. They use small blades to cut open the victim's outer clothing, and then they cut open the money-filled belt. (Early merchants often hid their money in a belt near the buckle.) They steal all the money. Pickpocketing gangs have a superstition that they must steal everything; if they leave some behind, something unlucky will happen.

They can also use smoke bombs to obscure the customers' vision. For example, they use a newspaper to cover the customer's view, and the third hand reaches under the newspaper to the customer's clothes. Sometimes they have an accomplice knock the customer's hat off, and when the customer bends over to pick it up, the pickpocket seizes the opportunity to strike.

In the past ten years, people have generally preferred to use handbags instead of pockets in their trousers, which is the thing that pickpocket gangs hate the most, because the bag is held tightly in the left hand, making it impossible to move. In the early years, when gold chains were popular, all respectable people liked to use them, especially those wearing Western suits, who would display their gold watch chains outside their vest pockets, showing off everywhere. But in the blink of an eye, they would fall into the hands of pickpockets. The substitutes that were developed followed, which were Parker pens, etc., hung on the small pockets of Western suits. These valuable American goods were all the rage in Shanghai a decade ago. The price was high, no matter if the pens were new or used. The thieves could get rid of them easily, so stealing them became common. This type of theft was called "eating steel pens," or "eating big draws."

If a pickpocket was caught stealing a metal pen, or if they did not have time to hide it and someone noticed, they would have to be extremely alert. The pickpocket would throw the pen on the ground or on the floor of the tram, and immediately kick it aside. An accomplice would be waiting to pick it up and return the pen to the owner, who might even thank them.

Wharf Activities: Combining Soft and Hard Tactics

"Running the base" refers to the "pickpocketing gangs" that are dispatched to operate at the wharves. "Base" is a slang term for "ship." Shanghai was a prosperous port, and the wharves were scattered along the banks of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek. Before the war, countless ships docked at and departed from the wharves every day. Operating in this area naturally offered significant benefits, but the all-powerful 36 Gangs had already occupied the territory. The "Old Brothers Gang's" "pickpocketing gang" was ultimately weak and lacked influence, so they could not compete. But where there were benefits, the pickpocketing gangs never gave up. However, only the "respectable" older members of the Old Brothers Gang could participate in "running the base." At the same time, they needed special powers to protect their occupied wharves and prevent aggression from other gangs. This required using tactics, combining soft and hard approaches, and using the art of "building relationships." They would select talented individuals from among their peers, bring them in as "fellow pickpocketing brothers," and try to bring in new members to help them. The more gang members they had, the more glamorous their status became. Thus, they could attack or defend, and look for opportunities to make money in their territory. Therefore, whether they were "uncles" or "devils" (partners), they had to be agile and dress neatly, otherwise they could not operate on the wharves.

Amphibious Operations: Masterful Accomplishments

The activities of the "running the base" gang were divided into three major categories:

"Warehouse" - "Warehouse" is a slang term for cargo warehouses. All theft of goods being unloaded from ships or loaded onto ships from warehouses was the gang's specialty. When goods were unloaded and passed through the wharf, small groups of three to five "warehouse" members would take advantage of the busy unloading process to "cut off some vegetables" from the outside of the packages. Although the amount taken was small, it accumulated into substantial profits. Even if the cargo owner found out, the loss was limited, so they would not quibble. If an entire item was stolen, the cargo owner and the person in charge would have to pay compensation, inevitably leading to conflict.

As for why the porters would not stop them when they saw packages being cut, experienced porters earn their wages with sweat and blood. Why should they offend the strong? They are not familiar with the cargo owner anyway, and even if they defended the goods, the cargo owner would never "issue a commendation." Instead, they would make the old brothers resent them, and they would immediately gather a crowd to cause trouble and "give you color" (punish you). If the goods had already been transported from the warehouse to a barge, when the barge was still docked and had not yet set sail, it was a golden opportunity. The old brothers would unceremoniously steal the entire item. Because at this point, the warehouse was no longer responsible, and the loss belonged to the cargo owner or the barge owner. The theft route was either by water or by land, mostly using small rowboats. This action was always somewhat dangerous, often requiring a full-scale performance. Experienced barge owners, in order to avoid trouble, often made deals with the "uncle gangs" in advance, allowing them a certain amount of money to ensure safety. The "uncles" were naturally happy to enjoy this kind of "peaceful income" and even considered themselves to be "building relationships."

Extortion and Fraud: A Mix of Laughter and Tears

"Full Mouth Pick" - This is a collective term for extorting smugglers. Smuggling has always been rampant in Shanghai's wharves. Most of these could be agreed upon verbally, so the profits were high, and there was no need for much fighting. It was almost entirely a matter of diplomatic skills. However, those engaged in this profession needed to have many years of experience and a keen eye. When they saw someone transporting smuggled goods or contraband, they would step forward and question them. The barge owners, with a guilty conscience, would have to spend money to silence them. The types of smuggled goods and contraband, and the gang's slang, are as follows:

Item Name: Slang

Opium: Black Old

Private Dust: White Old

Smuggled Grains: Wine Pearls

Smuggled Inferior Auxiliary Coins: Ancient Gun Screws

Smuggled Inferior Copper Coins: Yellow Millet

Firearms and Ammunition: Board Head

Bullets: Connected Hearts

Obscene Pictures: (Slang Unknown)

The verdict was announced at 10:00 AM yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court. Thirteen defendants, including Zhang Hongtu and Yu Xiangyan, who were in custody, were brought in from the detention center at 9:30 AM. Of the twenty-three defendants who were released on bail, only eight appeared. Twenty-two proxy lawyers all appeared in court to hear the verdict. The audience section was as crowded as before. Presiding Judge Mei Erhe and Judge Tie Changzhuan, accompanied by the court clerk, appeared on time. After Judge Mei asked each defendant their name, age, hometown, and address, he stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Zhang Hongtu, Zhang Bowei Kangjing Jun, Chen Jingyao, Zhuang Renmao Zhu Biwen, Zhang Kaiyuan, Zhang Zelong, Zhu Peizong, Gu Zhenmin, Yu Peien, Xia Dingwu, Sun Xuesan, Li Jie, Xu Chuangui, Cai Zhidao, He Zuen, Yu Xiangyan, Yu Zhonglu, Jin Yunting, Cao Zuxin, Li Fenbin, Wu Lianqing, Xia Zhaozhen, Yu Kanghou, Yang Wenli, Shen Yunsheng, Zhou Jinhua, Xu Binghong, Yu Yifu, and Li Hangxin, jointly and continuously sought direct profit from the affairs they were in charge of. Zhang Hongtu and Yu Xiangyan are each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Zhang Bokang is sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights.

After Judge Mei finished reading the main text, he explained in a gentle tone, "The purchasing department staff of the Road Bureau colluded with merchants, used their position to illegally receive commissions, or obtained property through loans, continuously for several months, constituting the crime under Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. Therefore, they are all punished. If they disagree with the judgment or believe that the cited articles are inappropriate, they can apply for retrial within ten days after receiving the judgment." After speaking, he announced the adjournment. Zhang Hongtu and his wife Yu Xiangyan, the former director of the Materials Department, showed no expression and were extremely calm. However, Zhang Bokang was dispirited after the verdict and almost collapsed. According to the lawyers of the defendants, they all felt that the sentence was too heavy and would appeal, especially regarding the punishment of the merchants who paid commissions as accomplices to corruption, believing that the sentence could be reduced after appeal.

### Chennault's Air Transport Team to Sign Contract This Morning; Flying Tigers to Undertake Flight Operations

The Executive Yuan has approved the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation (GARR) Air Transport Team, which will be managed by General Chennault. Chennault went to Nanjing on Monday to discuss the matter with relevant parties. After three days of discussions, both parties have largely resolved the points in the contract. Chen will return to Shanghai tomorrow evening and will sign the contract at the GARR at 10:30 AM this morning. The content of the contract will be publicly released after signing today. According to Chen, he will have further detailed discussions with the GARR and relevant parties in Shanghai regarding the future work of the air transport team, as well as financial issues. The nature of the air transport team is different from that of ordinary airlines. Its main task is to assist the GARR in transporting relief materials. The air transport team will also be terminated at the same time as the GARR. As for the twelve aircraft provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the US$2 million in funding provided by the GARR, they are still pending. Chen himself will also try to raise funds from various collaborators, aiming for US$1 million. Once all the issues are resolved, a contract will be signed in Qin and work will begin. The air transport team is under the GARR and serves the GARR, so it is very different from commercial airlines. Some of the Flying Tigers members who are participating in this work have come to China from the United States to undertake flight operations.

### Dispute Over Fish Transportation Still Unresolved; No Fish Available in Markets Yesterday

The dispute between pedicabs and trucks over the transportation of fish in this city has not yet been resolved through mediation. The fish market has been temporarily using its own trucks for transportation for several days. At the same time, relevant parties are negotiating to find a suitable solution. However, at approximately 4:00 AM yesterday, after most of the fish had been traded, a market closure occurred while the fish was being transported. Many people were talking at once, and all the traded goods waiting to be transported could not be shipped. Many asked for refunds, resulting in no fish being available in the markets yesterday. The fish that was stuck in the market was lost due to not being sold in time, which can be described as adding insult to injury. The market authorities have been working hard to negotiate for several days, and this change is truly unexpected.

Fishmongers Association Petitions the Mayor

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, more than one hundred members of the Fishmongers Association gathered at the entrance of the Municipal Government to request that the authorities stop the pedicab drivers from causing trouble. Wu Qiding, Zhao Zhixiang, Hu Rongfu, Yu Jingqing, and four others were selected as representatives to meet with the mayor and report the situation. Mayor Wu met with them, listened to the details, and said that the case would be jointly handled by the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Police Bureau.

### Finance and Budget Committee to Hold Subcommittee Meeting Today

[Our Report] The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council has scheduled a subcommittee meeting for 4:00 PM today at the committee's secretariat in Fuming Village. It is reported that the meeting will discuss issues related to the film industry and donations and taxes. The Budget Committee has also scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today at the committee's office.

### Railway Workers Demand Adjusted Treatment; Stage Petition; Bureau Agrees to Consider

[Our Report] Yesterday, workers from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways submitted a request to the bureau to adjust their treatment. In the afternoon, dozens of worker representatives staged a petition in the square in front of the office building. The bureau has agreed to consider the workers' demands. According to Director Chen Bozhuang, the treatment of workers on the two railways is already better than that of other railways. Low-level mechanics earn about 160,000 to 170,000 yuan per month, and non-mechanics earn 80% of that, about 130,000 to 140,000 yuan per month. Currently, the workers are requesting that their treatment be aligned with that of postal and telecommunications workers. The bureau is taking a "selfless and patriotic" attitude. However, the workers' stomachs must be filled first, so if the current treatment is indeed insufficient to maintain their livelihoods, the bureau will report to the Ministry of Communications to increase it appropriately.

Chen Bozhuang Goes to Nanjing

[Another Report] Chen Bozhuang, director of the two railways, and his secretary Sun Yafu took the evening train to Nanjing yesterday to visit the Ministry of Communications. It is reported that they will seek instructions on railway administration matters.

### Arrival of the Australian Steamer "Empress of Australia" in Shanghai: Carrying Over 300 Passengers, Staying Overnight and Departing This Morning

[Our Dispatch] The Changxing Shipping Company's Australian steamer "Empress of Australia" arrived in port yesterday afternoon and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, carrying 377 passengers without any cargo. This is not only the first time the "Empress of Australia" has come to Shanghai since the war, but also it had never been here before the war. It used to sail between the United Kingdom and Canada across the Atlantic Ocean, never having sailed in the Far East Pacific. This time, it came for military service and is scheduled to sail to Japan this morning, carrying returning British troops for reassignment. Therefore, the import and export procedures were handled by the British Company, and the Changxing Company did not participate. The ship has a gross tonnage of over 38,000 tons and three funnels, with an unusually magnificent appearance. Currently, it is still a military transport ship, so it is entirely grey, with wartime equipment throughout.

Arrival of American Ships Still Pending

[Another Dispatch] The second strike of American sailors has spread across the country and is very serious. Almost all ships have stopped sailing, and it has been over a month without a resolution. On the 22nd, local merchants received a broadcast from San Francisco with news of a strike resolution. Inquiries with American shipping agencies revealed that they had not yet received any telegrams. Furthermore, even if the strike is resolved, ships will need time to load and unload cargo, so it is feared that they will not be able to sail immediately. The arrival of ships to Shanghai is still pending. Recently, American ships have been leaving Shanghai more than arriving, gradually decreasing in number. As of yesterday, the American President Lines had only six ships docked in Shanghai, and the Fulai Company had only one ship. Including other American company ships, the total number is less than ten.

It is reported that the President Lines will have a ship arriving in Shanghai tomorrow, named "Red Gauntlet," which departed from the United States before the strike. It is said to be carrying large quantities of commercial goods such as gasoline and cotton.

### Giant Panda Remains: Dissection Performed: Two Doctors Personally Take Action: To Continue This Afternoon

[Our Dispatch] The dissection of the giant panda remains, originally scheduled for the 22nd, was postponed due to insufficient preparation. It was rescheduled for yesterday at the National Market Management Office of the Public Works Bureau at No. 2 Julan Road. Two doctors, Zheng Qingduan and Qin Lirang, pathology research experts from the Central Animal Husbandry Experimental Institute, personally took action. U.S. Army Captain Kenningham and Dr. Xu Yinqi, head of the Biology Department and specimen expert at Soochow University, were also present. However, because the giant panda remains had been preserved in water for too long, the flesh had hardened. After only cutting open about eight inches of fur on the abdomen, they were unable to continue due to incomplete tools. It was rescheduled for this afternoon at the Central Animal Husbandry Experimental Institute at No. 200 Hongqiao Road.

### Road Administration on Two Railways: Urgent Need for Improvement: Responsible Personnel Discuss Plans: Hoping for Improvement Next Year

[Our Special Feature] There is an old Chinese saying: "It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's difficult to take even one step outside the door." This kind of unambitious and demoralizing thought is certainly unacceptable in today's "One World" era. However, seeing the current state of domestic transportation, it is impossible not to feel discouraged!

Without going into distant matters, considering the situation on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, almost everyone who has experienced buying tickets and traveling on these lines has major complaints. These two railways used to be the most well-managed transportation organizations. Why are they now in such a terrible state? Did China degenerate and become incompetent after eight years of resistance against Japan?

Looking at the deeper reasons, it still involves the fundamental issues of the entire country. While it is true that the management authorities are not without fault, they are also complaining. They will present a series of figures to prove that the actual difficulty lies in the shortage of vehicles and the large number of passengers. For example, before the war, there were more than 4,000 freight cars, but now there are only over 2,000, and more than 800 of them have been borrowed by the Jinpu Railway. Before the war, there were 370 passenger cars, but now there are only 242. Before the war, there were 161 locomotives, but now there are only 93. As for passengers, statistics show that there were about 12,000 people per day before the war, but now there are 30,000 to 40,000.

The road administration authorities' reasons also have undeniable factual basis. The phenomenon of crowded passengers also includes a serious livelihood issue – the activity of "small-scale traders." Taking the Beijing-Shanghai Railway as an example, some commodity prices in Nanjing are much cheaper than in Shanghai. Pork there costs only over 1,000 yuan per catty, while in Shanghai it sells for over 3,000 yuan. With a single transaction, one can earn more than double the profit, and the cost of a train ticket for a mixed train fourth class is only over 1,000 yuan, and for a special express train third class is no more than 4,400 yuan. Therefore, many small-scale traders bring fresh pork to Shanghai for sale in large baskets and small bundles, and some also bring eggs and fresh fish. We often see short-clothed people lying on the floor in the North Station building at night, most of whom are waiting to buy tickets early in the morning to make a living. From the perspective of maintaining order and cleanliness, it seems necessary to ban them, but from another perspective, we cannot bear to cut off the livelihoods of so many people!

The regulations on the opening hours of ticket windows and the long queues when purchasing tickets are also a central point of criticism from passengers. However, the railway bureau explains that this is to prevent the rampant scalping of tickets, although the buying and selling of scalped tickets has not disappeared to this day. A third-class ticket costing over 4,000 yuan sometimes sells for over 10,000 yuan on the black market. In addition to all these phenomena that seem difficult to completely improve, the road administration authorities should at least and necessarily conduct strict supervision of the efficiency of the ticket office staff at all times.

According to responsible personnel, the sleepers on the two railways were laid by the British in 1902 and have been in use for more than 40 years. Due to long-term use and damage during the war, many of them have rotted and been damaged, which has affected the current train speed. Recently, the bureau has started a restoration plan to replace 400,000 sleepers, which is expected to be completed in February next year. At that time, the express train between Beijing and Shanghai will be able to arrive in four and a half hours, and the number of daily train services can also be greatly increased, which can greatly improve the transportation of passengers.

### Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra: Holding a Special Concert

### Dai Changling Sentenced to Two and a Half Years in Prison: Chen Yuan and Others to Be Sentenced on the 30th

[Our Dispatch] In the case of Dai Changling, suspected of being a traitor, the High Court yesterday sentenced him to two years and six months of imprisonment for colluding with an enemy country and plotting to resist his own country, deprived him of public rights for three years, and confiscated all his property except for the necessary living expenses for his family.

### Shanghai Women's Middle School Principal Wu Yizhi Case Heard

The High Court opened a hearing yesterday afternoon to investigate the case of Wu Yizhi, principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School in this city, who was accused by his widowed sister-in-law, Shen Huiying, of being a suspected traitor. Wu denied the accusations that he had served as a member of the puppet Municipal Education Association and a member of the puppet New China Newspaper Business Committee, and submitted documents from the Three People's Principles Youth League as proof. The court hearing was adjourned for further hearing. It is noted that the original principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School was Wu Zhiqian, who was murdered by traitors at the school on September 4th of the 28th year, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Wu Yizhi, until now.

### Li Hu and Others Adjourned for Further Hearing

In addition, the cases of Li Hu, a member of the escort team of the enemy China Central Water Products Company, Han Shoushan, a second-class police sergeant of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and Zou Shanbao, a merchant who manufactured military uniforms for the enemy, all suspected of being traitors, were all adjourned for further hearing after questioning.

### Weather Forecast

### Social Services: Responding to Readers

Legal Questions

(1) Wartime Wife

Chen Yi asks: A friend of mine fled to the rear during the early stages of the war and lost contact for five years. He remarried in the rear and had children. Now he has returned to his hometown and discovered that his original wife (married before the war) is still alive, and his new wife has also come to his hometown. Now my friend intends to divorce his original wife. What path should he take? (1) Is it legal for the man to file for divorce with the court on the grounds that he had been separated for many years and her whereabouts were unknown? (2) Is it feasible to disregard her and only give her a considerable living allowance to make her leave? (3) If the original wife files a lawsuit, does it constitute bigamy? (4) There seem to be many cases like this. Has the legislative authority recently enacted any appropriate new laws to deal with such marital problems? (5) Can the original wife's children request a judgment that they be taken away by the woman? (6) If the woman makes harsh financial demands that the man (a civil servant) cannot afford, can the court be requested to reduce them?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) During the War of Resistance, postal services and transportation between the occupied areas and the free areas were never interrupted. It is not difficult to find out whether the original wife's whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, using this as a reason for remarriage is not sufficient. (2) It must be with the consent of the original wife, otherwise it is not permissible. (3) He should be held responsible for bigamy. (4) Recently, no new laws have been promulgated regarding the resolution of such marital disputes. (5) After a divorce, the support of children is legally the responsibility of the husband, but if there is another agreement, it shall be followed. (6) In this case, the woman is not at fault and should be given a considerable maintenance allowance according to law, until the woman dies or marries someone else.

(2) Elopement with Another Man

Zhang Chengye asks: A woman, A, could not bear her husband, B's, abuse, so she fell in love with her neighbor, C (unmarried). Subsequently, A (age 22 at the time) eloped with C to Shanghai and lived together. It has been twelve years, and they have had three sons and two daughters. Nine years ago, B's mother came to Shanghai. Through mediation, C gave B a subsidy of one hundred yuan, and B's mother signed the divorce certificate on behalf of B. Now the certificate has been lost. Please advise: (1) Is the certificate valid if signed by B's mother on his behalf? (2) Is C guilty of seduction by cohabitating with A? (3) If this crime is constituted, how should it be punished? (4) Can a newspaper announcement declaring the certificate lost be used as evidence? (5) Can A request a divorce in court?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) Invalid. (2) Crime of disrupting a family. (3) Imprisonment for up to three years. (4) The certificate is fundamentally invalid, and whether it is lost or not is irrelevant, but it can also be announced in the newspaper for future reference. (5) Requesting is permissible, but whether it can achieve the goal is a matter of judicial discretion.

### Cotton Cloth Standards Approved: Cost Re-examined Based on Yarn Prices: Wholesale Profit Set at 12% Above Factory Price

[Our Dispatch] At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the Social Bureau convened the second meeting of the Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee. Attendees included Director Gu of the Social Bureau, Zhao Gongxin of the Municipal Council, Chen Jiazhen of the Textile Construction Company, Chang Guangdi and Wu Shuying of the Sixth District Textile Guild, Zhu Shangyi of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Bu Boxun and Lu Runjin of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry, and Huang Jiufeng and Bei Zairong of the Cotton Cloth Industry. Director Gu presided over the meeting and reported Mayor Wu's determination to stabilize yarn and cloth prices, as well as the significant mission undertaken by the committee. The mission of the committee is (1) to review reasonable prices and (2) to eliminate the black market. At the same time, the regulations passed in the previous session should still be referred to as regulations, and the members of each unit should be determined to facilitate the convening of meetings at any time.

When reviewing prices, Huang Jiufeng of the cotton cloth industry suggested that the standards for reviewing cotton cloth prices should be based on popular, widely sold goods. According to the current sales situation, the standards should be (1) 12-pound fine twill, (2) 12-pound white plain fine cloth, (3) No. 190 mercerized Shilin, and (4) Yuan Piji. There were no objections. Regarding prices, Huang Jiufeng reported the market prices before and after the foreign exchange adjustment. (1) 12-pound fine twill was 54,000 yuan before the exchange rate adjustment, with a maximum of 90,000 yuan, and the current market price is 80,000 to 82,000 yuan. (2) 12-pound fine cloth was 56,000 yuan before the exchange rate adjustment, with a maximum of 107,000 yuan, and the recent price is 78,000 to 80,000 yuan. No. 190 mercerized Shilin was 92,000 yuan before the adjustment, with a maximum of 150,000 yuan, and the recent price is 135,000 yuan. Thread Piji was 70,000 yuan before the adjustment, with a maximum of 120,000 yuan, and the current market price is 102,000 yuan.

Next, Bu Boxun, a representative of the dyeing and weaving industry, said that according to the current cost of the above four types of cloth, the actual cost of 12-pound fine cloth is at least 88,380 yuan, 12-pound fine twill is 80,000 yuan, No. 190 mercerized Shilin is 151,000 yuan, and Piji is 116,000 yuan. The market prices reported by the representatives of the cloth industry are not enough to cover the cost.

Director Gu said that the market prices and costs stated by the representatives of the cotton cloth and dyeing and weaving industries are very accurate. However, for the sake of reasonably suppressing cloth prices, it is necessary to carefully discuss and decide. He then entrusted the dyeing and weaving industry to formulate a detailed report based on the yarn prices determined by the Textile Control Committee, detailing the cost, factory payment, and legal profits, and submit it to the Social Bureau. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Council will then jointly investigate and verify the report before discussing it again at the next meeting. The attending representatives of the cotton cloth and dyeing and weaving industries jointly proposed that the cotton cloth market price should be flexible and determined separately according to the level of raw materials. Zhu Shangyi of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce said that the regulation of cotton cloth prices should include not only raw materials, but also other labor, taxes, and profits in the calculation to be reasonable.

Then, the profit of cotton cloth wholesalers was discussed, and it was unanimously decided that the wholesale price should be 12% above the factory price. Finally, Director Gu stated that now that there are general regulations on the factory price and wholesale price of cotton cloth, strict regulations on punishment should be imposed if manufacturers and wholesalers manipulate or raise prices in the future.

Wu Shuying, the representative of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Guild, believed that the cotton cloth market price is lower than the cost, and factories are selling at a loss. She still disagreed with the disposal item. However, the representatives said that Mayor Wu is determined to stabilize yarn and cloth prices, and they should unanimously support the price stabilization policy.

### Technical Issues in Yarn Allocation: Textile Control Committee Holds Symposium: Classification, Allocation Numbers, and Payment Awaiting Further Discussion: Yarn Dealers Also Need to Submit Reports for Allocation

[Our Dispatch] The Textile Industry Management Committee convened a symposium at the Textile Construction Conference Room, No. 130 Hankou Road, at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, bringing together the dyeing and weaving, knitting, underwear, towel, blanket, handkerchief, handmade cotton weaving, and yarn and cloth industries. The technical issues in the implementation of cotton yarn allocation were discussed. Deputy Director Li Shengbo and Director Liu Wenteng presided over the meeting. Mr. Li announced that Director Wu, who is also the chairman of the committee, had allocated 12,004 and a half pieces of yarn to the yarn factories, based on the standard of 1.75 million yuan per piece for 20-count yarn. Starting this Saturday, the yarn will be allocated to the various cotton product manufacturing industries over 15 days. Each guild will calculate the amount needed based on the previously reported needs, discounted by 60%, and allocate half of the amount first, as follows:

Dyeing and weaving industry: 7,816 and a half pieces
Knitting industry: 1,902 pieces
Underwear industry: 1,015 pieces
Towel and blanket industry: 720 and a half pieces
Handmade cotton weaving: 460 and a half pieces
Handkerchief industry: 90 pieces

As for the manufacturing industries that have not submitted reports, such as the canvas industry, and the members of each guild who have not participated in the application, they are limited to truthfully submitting reports within these 15 days and will participate in the allocation next time. Director Liu also stated that (1) the members of each guild must accurately report their production equipment, yarn usage, and yarn inventory. (2) This yarn allocation must focus on practical use. Each guild is responsible for reporting its allocation, production, and sales situation after the allocation. (3) The actual situation of each factory that has submitted a report for allocation may not match. Each guild is responsible for continuing to strictly investigate. If the application is excessive, it should be substantially reduced. Subsequently, representatives from various industries expressed their support for the policy of the主管authorities and felt the significance and difficulty of their responsibilities. They hoped to work together under the leadership of the Textile Control Committee. Finally, Pan Shihao, Xu Zhaohou, Li Daofa, Ren Jiandao, and others were nominated to meet with the responsible personnel of the Textile Construction Business Office and the organizers of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Guild this morning to discuss the classification of goods and the detailed procedures for reviewing the allocation standards, payment, and delivery. Mr. Li stated to the yarn dealers that in addition to the yarn used by the above six manufacturing industries in this city, a survey report must also be submitted for review and allocation, and the yarn dealers will handle it. He also said that the restrictions on yarn going to South China will soon be lifted. It is heard that the above six manufacturing industries are scheduled to meet at the Dyeing and Weaving Guild this morning to discuss the matter.

### Public Bonds Unable to Rise

It is also rumored that "Index-Linked Redemption" is said to have large accounts settling at the 78th floor. However, with the revival of the "Index-Linked Redemption" theory, there are also new buyers, and slightly more people are short covering at lower prices. The market is still mediocre. The Unified C opened at 2,200 yuan in the morning and was immediately surrounded by sellers, gradually falling to 2,010 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, it closed slightly lower by 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The same was true for Unified A and B. Unified D was slightly lower by 50 yuan, and Unified E fell by 70 yuan.

### Limited Allocation of Rayon: Market Prices Remain at Original Levels: Allocation Based on Actual Needs to Begin Next Month

[Our Dispatch] The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Government Material Supply Committee, sold rayon as usual yesterday, allocating a total of 119 and a half cases to various silk weaving factories. The allocation price for No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang was 2.8 million yuan per case. The price for the same number of miscellaneous brands was 2.75 million yuan per case. However, the quantity was extremely small, so most of the silk factories did not receive any, and those who did only received five to ten or so bales at most. It is said that starting next month, allocation will be implemented based on actual needs, four times a month.

In addition, the Textile Construction Company also sold rayon yesterday, totaling 172 cases. Among them, weaving tape factories accounted for 51 cases, and rayon merchants accounted for 121 cases. The allocation price for No. 120 miscellaneous brands Youguang and Banguang was 2.75 million yuan per case. No. 75 JINJI Banguang was 2.38 million yuan per case. No. 150 miscellaneous brands Youguang was 2.59 million yuan per case. Therefore, although the shouted prices in the rayon market yesterday remained at the original levels, not a single case was traded. Factory management was stable with a slight sense of fatigue. The transaction price for Grade D yesterday was 50,000 to 100,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Grade E had few transactions, and ordinary goods and Gan Jing were still shouting at the original prices of the previous day, with rare transactions. Silk goods and quilt covers were down another 50,000 yuan yesterday, and there were still no buyers. There were no changes in other goods.

### Money Supply Eases, Buying Sentiment Strong: Both Gold and Paper Money Recover Well

Raw gold still rose slightly yesterday, opening around 2.235 million in the morning. Sentiment was quite good, and powerful players were taking in. From 2.232 million, it gradually rose. After 10:00 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 130 bars at a price of 2.2425 million. After that, the money supply was still loose and abundant. Near noon, demand still exceeded supply, rising to 2.25 million before stabilizing slightly. At noon, it hovered around 2.245 million. In the afternoon, it continued to be slightly stable, and the next-day settlement was stationed at around 2.25 million. As a result, it closed 15,000 higher than the previous close. Ornament gold rose to 2.38 million. Pattern silver and plain silver dollars continued to be low. Underground short-term financing was even looser, with interest rates ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 cents.

Foreign currencies were stable with few changes. The retail price of the U.S. dollar was still 3,500 yuan, with demand. In the underground market, it was between 4,100 yuan and 4,150 yuan, slightly higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars remained stable due to the fact that both the spot and term rates in the Hong Kong market had been hovering for several days, hovering around 880 yuan, with little change compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was also stationed around 880 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,070 yuan with supply. The British exchange rate was around 14,100 yuan, with very few transactions. The listed price of the U.S. exchange rate was still flat.

### Business Firms Prohibited from Accepting Deposits

Those Who Do Not Rely on Deposits for Lending Are Not Subject to Prohibition

[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance recently issued a document to various regions, clarifying the regulation in the "Measures for Managing Banks" that "those who accept deposits without calling themselves banks are regarded as banks." That is, ordinary business firms should be absolutely prohibited from accepting deposits. However, those who handle fund transfers, remittances, or handle bill discounting and lend money to relevant parties for the purpose of using funds, and do not rely on absorbing deposits for lending, are not subject to prohibition. However, they still need to have a legitimate document for a certain business activity to prove it.

### Fellow Traders Eager to Sell Off: Yarn Market Turns Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned downward. Reports indicated that the combined distribution of the Liaoning Cooperative was only slightly over 24,000 units per month. Many factories still reportedly sold excess yarn freely. Investigations revealed that private factories accounted for two-thirds of the quota, only 16,000 units. However, the total production of private factories was more than five times this amount. It was easily deduced that a large portion of yarn from private factories would still flood the market, inevitably leading to a significant increase in the supply of actual goods. Consequently, market sentiment turned pessimistic, and fellow traders eagerly competed to sell off their holdings. 20-count yarns of various brands fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Fine yarns initially rose but ultimately stabilized, resulting in no significant changes from yesterday.

### Purchase of Hankou Cotton

The Association Finds It Inconvenient to Handle Uniformly; Members Will Negotiate Individually

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau previously proposed a plan to purchase Hankou cotton, seeking the consent of the Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District. The Association's board of directors has now decided that each member will negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau individually, rather than having the Association handle it uniformly. A member of the Association stated that there were two reasons for this decision: (1) The required cotton quality varied among factories, making it inconvenient to handle uniformly; (2) There were theoretical issues. Regarding the quality of domestic cotton, it was stated that among the Shaanxi cotton, American Upland cotton could be spun into 32-count yarn, while local cotton could be spun into 20-count or higher yarn; the American Upland cotton from Central China could be spun into approximately 30-count yarn, while local cotton could be spun into less than 20-count yarn. Currently, the city's need is for fine yarn of 30 counts or higher; coarse yarn can only be woven into coarse cloth, which is sold in rural areas.

### Large Quantity of Foreign Paper Arrives

The "Hai Sui Te" (海歲特) of the Tianxiang Foreign Firm, arriving from Norway the day before yesterday, brought 2,500 wooden crates of paper, 12,270 rolls of newspaper, and various types of foreign paper. It is currently docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading. Furthermore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Zhixin" (執信) ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday, carrying 3,500 bags of refined salt, reported by the Jiuda Refined Salt Company.

### Chinese Stocks Weak and Unable to Rise; Trading Volume Sharp Decline; Speculation Rife that Spot Transactions Will Be Implemented Next Week; Sentiment Agitated, with a Slight Increase in Buying Interest Near Closing

Chinese stocks were slightly stable when trading opened yesterday. Off-market speculative capital seemed to be participating, but with limited capacity, the market turned weak again shortly after a small initial rise. Trading volume decreased after 10:00 AM, and market conditions were worryingly bleak. As a result, brokers were facing an unfavorable situation. Number 176 closed out Yongxin Yarn and bought Xinhao, causing the market to feel even more cautious and weak. Number 233 closed out a large volume of Yongxin Yarn, forced down to within 730 yuan. By 11:30 AM, the market was in a tug-of-war. Due to limited buying interest, most transactions closed at low prices. Compared to the previous closing prices, popular stocks such as Yongxin Yarn, Xinhao, Jingfu, and Qinxin declined slightly, while Meiya and Xinguang fell by 3-4%. Cold stocks such as Datong rose slightly, while Tongyi and Xinya Underwear remained flat. The remaining stocks declined slightly. The afternoon was stable with little change, with limited ups and downs, and the market continued to hover. Near the closing, there was widespread speculation that spot transactions would be implemented on Monday of next week, leading to a slight increase in buying interest. However, due to limited time, the closing prices differed slightly from the final transaction prices. Overall, compared to the previous closing prices, popular stocks such as Yongxin Yarn, Xinhao, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxin all declined slightly. Cold stocks such as Zhongfang, Huafeng, and Match Company declined slightly, while Datong, Zhongsih, and Rongfeng rose slightly. Xinya, Tongyi, Cement, and Liann remained flat. Jinglun and Wuhe each fell by about half a percent. The total trading volume was 6.82 million shares. Price fluctuations for various stocks off-market were minimal.

Foreign stocks were stable, hovering without much movement. However, the situation still felt unsustainable. Compared to the previous closing prices, Yeguang rose slightly, while Yisha, British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, Paper Industry, Steel Industry, and Asia declined slightly. Jardine Brewery remained flat.

### Four Associations Discuss Industrial and Mining Loan Measures; Machinery and Raw Materials Allowed as Collateral; Real Estate and Other Immovable Properties Excluded

[Nanjing, 4:00 PM, 24th] The Shanghai Office of the Four Associations is handling industrial and mining loans, originally intending to assist with working capital. The regulations stipulated that raw materials and finished products would be used as collateral. However, the office has recently received repeated requests from industrial and commercial groups to broaden the scope of collateral to include real estate and machinery. After detailed study, the office decided that if raw materials and finished products were insufficient as collateral, machinery that had been put into operation, or had plans to begin operation, and met manufacturing standards approved by the head office, could be used as collateral for the insufficient portion. However, real estate and other immovable properties were not allowed as collateral. The industrial and mining loan measures are listed below:

1.  Industrial and mining loans will use raw materials, materials, finished products, and semi-finished products as collateral. The discount rate will be determined by the head office and branch offices at any time, based on market conditions and the nature of the collateral.

2.  If the collateral in the previous article is insufficient, machinery that has been put into operation, or has plans to begin operation, and meets manufacturing standards approved by the head office, may be used as partial collateral. The proportion shall be limited to a maximum of 50%. The discount rates are as follows:

    A. New machinery, with an age of three years or less, will be collateralized at 50% of the current new price.

    B. Existing machinery, with a working age of ten years or less, will be collateralized at 40% of the assessed value.

    C. Existing machinery, with a working age of twenty years or more, will be collateralized at 30% of the assessed value.

3.  Real estate and other immovable properties shall not be used as collateral under any circumstances.

### High Commodity Prices and Heavy Interest Rates: Coal Market Trading is Sparse

The coal market is experiencing sparse trading in white coal. Traders are hesitant to buy due to high commodity prices and heavy interest rates, thus they are limited to actual sales volume. Sellers, on the other hand, are maintaining high prices due to the scarcity of goods. As a result, the market is in a hovering situation with little change. Previously, the market price of bituminous coal lumps was much higher than the price allocated by the Fuel Commission due to shortages. Recently, the supply of spot goods has become looser, so factories are directly purchasing from the Fuel Commission. Sales for coal merchants are gradually cooling, and the market is extremely weak.

### Ban on Wheat Exports: Market Prices Plunge Yesterday; Rice Prices Also Decline Slightly

Rice arrivals are continuous, with over 10,000 stones registered for both customers and goods, but digestion remains sluggish. The market is steadily declining. Southern and Northern japonica rice are successively down by over 1,000 yuan. "Yangxian" (羊秈) and "Buxian" (埠秈) rice are still acceptable, but medium and lower grades are also down by 1,000 yuan. "Duxian" (杜秈) and "Kexian" (客秈) rice are down by another 1,000 yuan. "Baiyuan" (白元) rice is gradually declining by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan with limited transactions. "Yinyuan" (陰元) rice is down by another 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The oil market is digesting well, with raw oil remaining popular. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil are flat, while sesame oil remains unchanged. The Shantou yellow soybean market is closed, causing fatigue from accumulated work. Yellow soybeans are up slightly by 1,000 yuan. Sesame seeds are doing well. Red sorghum is similar. Tea beans are sluggish, and red beans are down by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are trading slightly in high-quality goods, with buyers in other locations picking up high-priced goods, causing a rebound of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Peanut sales are sluggish, down by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Arrivals of red beans are mostly scattered, and buyers are also sluggish, continuing to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes are also weak, down by 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat bran is firm. Due to the ban on wheat exports, digestion is stagnant, and prices have plunged by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, with a lack of formal transactions.

### Edible Oil Price Limits Increased: Rapeseed Oil Up by 8%

The Bureau of Social Affairs invited representatives from oil and grain industries, oil tillage industry associations, private oil mills, China Vegetable Oil Factory, and China Edible Oil Company to convene a review meeting to readjust edible oil prices as follows: Qingdao raw oil, 98,000 yuan; soybean oil, 98,000 yuan; rapeseed oil, 93,000 yuan; raw sesame oil, 92,000 yuan. Except for raw sesame oil, which was not previously included in the price limits, the above three types are added for the first time. Based on proportional calculations, rapeseed oil has the highest price increase, accounting for 8%, soybean oil accounts for 5%, and raw oil has the least, only about 1-2%. Yesterday, the prices of all goods in the market did not exceed the new price limits. Zhongzhi and Zhongshi continue to maintain a daily joint distribution of 200 barrels of edible oil, totaling 700 dan. Private factories such as Dade Xin and Dayou Yu also put over 1,400 dan of edible oil on the market. It is understood that if not affected by power supply, private factories can produce 20,000 dan per month, Zhongzhi 10,000 dan, and Zhongshi regularly imports 10,000 dan from Qingdao, which is more than sufficient to meet the city's needs. If restricted by electricity, production may be reduced by half. This price adjustment will undoubtedly benefit various manufacturers in maintaining costs.

### Financial Panic in Wuhan: Executive Headquarters Seeks Rescue Measures

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 24th] The financial market here is undergoing constant changes. According to reports, the number of businesses and money houses that have collapsed has reached 117. To rescue the recent crisis, the Wuhan Executive Headquarters convened a symposium with the financial sector and relevant agencies yesterday, deciding on the following: (A) Investigate the actual situation of the collapsed businesses and strictly deal with any cases of fraud; (B) Establish an economic research group to determine measures for maintaining financial stability in detail; (C) Resolutely support the 58 legally registered money houses and crack down on underground money houses; (D) Consult the Ministry of Finance to consider establishing a joint reserve bank.

### Raw Silk Purchase Price: Both Sides Have Not Reached an Agreement; Another Meeting Will Be Held Today to Decide

[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives from the Central Trust Bureau, China Silk Corporation, Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Central Bank will hold a meeting at 2:00 PM today to continue discussing the raw silk purchase price issue. Yesterday, the China Silk Corporation and Central Trust Bureau convened a discussion meeting with representatives from silk factories and silk merchants, informally exchanging opinions, involving the difficulties of silk merchants and general import/export issues. In general, the Central Trust Bureau's position is based on a financial perspective, believing that the government subsidies are already high based on the previously agreed price, and the merchants' demands are excessive. The China Silk Corporation, standing from the perspective of producers, believes that the purchase price of raw silk should be determined by referring to the situations in other countries and the production costs in China, so that the national treasury is not burdened too heavily, and silk merchants can also prosper.

### Import Statistics for September: Imports Four Times Exports, Cotton Leads; Oils, Waxes, Bristles, and Hides Are Major Exports

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to customs statistics recently released, the total value of Shanghai's imports and exports in September of this year is as follows (unit: thousands of legal tender yuan): September | Cumulative from January to September

(1) Imports 222,606,170 | 781,855,461
(2) UNRRA Goods 66,260,059 | 232,295,792
(3) Exports 53,520,163 | 161,763,948
(4) Trade Deficit 169,086,007 | 620,091,513
(5) Trade Deficit Including UNRRA Goods 235,346,126 | 852,387,306

The value of imports in September was approximately four times the value of exports. If the value of UNRRA goods is added to the value of imports, it is approximately five and a half times the value of exports. Among the imports in September, raw cotton still ranked first, totaling 34,801,090,000 yuan. Chemical products ranked second, totaling 16,841,977,000 yuan.

### Ministry of Education Recently Formulated Two Principles for National Schools and Academic Institutions to Hire Foreign Personnel

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Education has recently formulated two principles for national schools and academic research institutions to hire foreign personnel: (1) The school will hire the personnel independently, and the school will bear the cost of the treatment.

As for the detailed measures, the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education is discussing them with the Counsellor's Office.

They will respectively compete against Youlian and the Soviet team tomorrow night for the championship.

In the women's group, You Team and Dongqing first competed. Dongqing ultimately demonstrated less experience, making it difficult to achieve anything. You Team thus consistently led, winning the first set 21 to 12. In the second set, You Team found even greater success, with Dongqing losing again 7 to 21. In the final set, You Team easily won, 21 to 6. Concluding the match, You Team easily defeated Dongqing in three straight sets.

### Mayor's Cup Small Ball Redecision; Championship Still Undecided

Longjie and Jianxing Recreate a Draw

The Mayor's Cup small ball final was played for the second time yesterday at Jinyuan Park. Jianxing and Longjie were still unable to gain an advantage. Although the game was extended for 20 minutes to determine the winner, the result remained a scoreless draw, ending 0-0. The Mayor's Cup championship thus remains undecided, and a third rematch will be scheduled.

Yesterday's game drew a large crowd. Mayor Wu specially sent Wang Guanqing as a representative to present awards. In the first half, Longjie's offense was very strong, with Jianxing's Luo Jiefu saving multiple dangerous shots. In the second half, Jianxing suddenly became active, with Chen Mingzhe charging straight towards the goal, which could have easily resulted in a score. However, he acted too hastily and hit the ball too high, to the disappointment of the spectators. At the end of regulation time, neither team had scored, so the game was extended for 20 minutes, and the situation became even more intense. The result was still a pair of goose eggs, resulting in another draw.

Jianxing: Tao Ziming, Shen Jinda, Xu Guofu, Tao Jianfu, Chen Mingzhe, Gu Yiche, Luo Shoufu.

Longjie: Sheng Peter, Zhou Yongfang, Yu Zhenyue, Gao Xiuqing, Zhao Yongfang, Gu Dirong, Lin Shaojun (replaced by Yu Musen).

How this situation is to be handled has been submitted to the Civil Affairs Bureau for instructions. It is reported that after receiving the report, the Civil Affairs Bureau stated that (1) applications for national identification cards should be forwarded as soon as they are received, and there should be absolutely no delays; (2) during the period when each Bao cadre is handling household registration, if people have situations involving registration, removal, birth, death, marriage, divorce, recognition, adoption, migration, etc., the Jia chiefs should always urge each household to apply for various registrations, and nothing should be omitted. These stipulations have been repeatedly communicated and detailed in the 13th point of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Letter No. 229, issued on September 10.

### Northern Jiangsu Situation Improves; People Still Fearful; Tears Everywhere

— Zhenjiang, 14th. Special Correspondent Fang Canglang

Although the Communist army was defeated in the plains along the canal and retreated to the marsh areas of Xinghua and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu, hoping to make a final struggle, it is already like a trapped beast within the strong encirclement of the National Army. Their future fate is self-evident. What deserves our attention now is the series of problems left behind by the Communist army, the most important of which are the land reform policy, the reconstruction of basic-level administrative institutions, and the restoration of the rural economy. The people of northern Jiangsu are now watching the government's actions with a mixture of joy, fear, grief, and hope, and eagerly hope that the government will quickly come up with a wise solution to prove the cruelty and absurdity of the Chinese Communist Party with bloody facts, and reflect that the policies implemented by the National Government are indeed gentle, appropriate, and suitable for the needs of all Chinese people.

Fifty-Year-Old Woman with Bound Feet Killed by Remnant Bandits

After Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Baoying were successively recovered by the National Army, the people along the canal have seen the light of day again. However, because the National Army's advance was rapid, it was difficult to restore the communication between the city and the countryside in each county for a time. Therefore, in the vast rural areas beyond the points and lines on both sides of the canal, there are still a few remnant bandits who failed to escape, hiding in the countryside, waiting for an opportunity to make trouble. In the Luyang Lake area at the junction of Gaoyou and Jiangdu counties, remnant bandits killed innocent people who were unwilling to join the bandits on the 8th and 9th of this month to vent their anger. Their methods of killing innocent people were even more vicious than those of the Japanese invaders, often using hoes to behead innocent people. On the 9th of this month, the villagers in the area learned of the good news that the National Army had recovered Shaobo. The villagers ran to tell each other, but the remnant bandits discovered this. That night, more than 100 people were killed, even a woman with bound feet over the age of 50 was not spared. It is reported that when the eastward-窜 能 army returned to the small Jixiang area in Fanchuan, the number of people killed by the remnant bandits was also large.

Nothing is More Urgent Than Clearing the Countryside; Post-War Work is Busy

Now the National Army ××× Division stationed in Yangzhou has taken advantage of the victory to advance. General Liang Bo of the ×××× Brigade of the Gaobao Reorganization has personally led his troops to garrison in Yangzhou to assume the heavy responsibility of pacifying the local area. The order on the west bank of the canal has been improving day by day. After the east bank's remnant bandits were searched and suppressed by the capable troops of our ××× Division Huang department, the security of the countryside can also be guaranteed.

From the 9th of this month to the 15th of this month, it should be the day for the refugees who fled outside the canal to return to the city. From the 16th of this month to the end of this month, it is almost the day for the refugees in each county to return to the town. From next month, refugees from outside each county can safely return to their hometowns, resume their businesses, and return to farming. At present, in the post-war reconstruction work of each county along the canal, nothing is more urgent than clearing the countryside.

Quickly Research Land Policy to Seek a Reasonable Solution

When the reporter arrived in Yangzhou on the 12th of this month and interviewed gentlemen and local elders from various counties in northern Jiangsu to inquire about the post-war reconstruction issues in the counties in the recovered area of northern Jiangsu, the conclusions obtained were: First, quickly clear the countryside to pacify the people; second, reconstruct basic-level administrative institutions and carefully select personnel, refresh rural administration, and start anew with the people to prevent criticism; third, carefully handle the land issue, and quickly send senior, reputable, knowledgeable, and well-connected officials to the recovered area of northern Jiangsu to study the reasons for the failure of the land distribution policy implemented by the Communist Party in northern Jiangsu, and conduct on-the-spot surveys of the area and types of land in northern Jiangsu, the current situation of farmland water conservancy, the habits of landlords and their land income rent, and the lives of owner-farmers and tenant farmers, in order to prepare for the revision of the land policy when order is established, the country is unified, and the constitution is implemented.

The Policies Implemented by the Communist Party Violate the Father of the Nation's Teachings

Most people in northern Jiangsu (including landlords and those without land) expressed doubts about the proposals published in the Shanghai and Nanjing newspapers to implement a moderate land policy in the recovered area of northern Jiangsu. Some experienced people even criticized this as a fallacy by some planners who do not move their limbs, do not distinguish between the five grains, and speculate about land issues behind closed doors. They also said that advocating to retain or tamper with the land policy left behind by the Chinese Communist Party in northern Jiangsu is actually contrary to the teachings of the Father of the Nation, because the Father of the Nation's methods of equalizing land rights and controlling capital are clearly stated in the "Three Principles of the People" and can never be replaced by the Chinese Communist Party's cold and cruel land policy or the seemingly right but actually wrong moderate land policy advocated by some people. However, in addition, some local administrative authorities also agree that this is a major event worth studying and should be carefully considered. Whether a moderate land distribution policy can be implemented first in northern Jiangsu, where great chaos has just subsided, has been ravaged by war, and both landlords and tenant farmers have fled for their lives under the high-pressure policies of the Communist Party, they hope that experienced experts will first go to the rural areas of northern Jiangsu to conduct on-the-spot investigations, carefully study the matter, and come up with a reasonable solution.

### Zhou Fohai Publicly Tried in the Dacheng Hall; Old Accounts of the "Two-Faced Man" Settled for the First Time

— Express Report from Nanjing and Beijing, 21st. Yang Yanbing

Unable to Withstand the Test of Artillery Fire; He Tore Off His Mask Himself

Zhou Fohai, a traitor, was one of the original five-member gang of the "Wang Regime." He successively served as the Secretary-General of the Pseudo Central Political Committee, the Pseudo National Government Commissioner, the Pseudo Vice President of the Executive Yuan, the Pseudo Minister of Finance, the Pseudo Mayor of Shanghai, and the Pseudo President of the Central Reserve Bank. Although his position in the pseudo-government was second only to the traitor Chen Gongbo, he formed his own faction, like a small overlord. His actions have harmed the country and his crimes are obvious. Therefore, the public trial of the traitor Zhou in the Dacheng Hall today can be called the climax of the capital's trial of traitors. Zhou Fohai is from Hunan. He studied at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan in his early years and made friends with insidious and cunning Japanese politicians. After returning to China, he worked as a professor at Lingnan University. During the Northern Expedition, he once served as the secretary of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters. Later, he also served as the secretary-general and director of the political department of the Wuhan branch of the Central Military Academy. Soon after, he colluded with Wang Jingwei and engaged in treacherous activities.

When he was the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, the flames of the War of Resistance were spreading across the plains of the north and south of the Yangtze River. At that time, Zhou Fohai also hoarsely shouted "Resist Japan" in a hypocritical manner. However, unable to withstand the test of artillery fire, his germs of defeatism erupted in his body like malaria germs. He began to feel uneasy about the country, eloped with the traitor Wang to Hanoi, and even became an echo of the traitor's surrender. Later, they simply tore off their masks and began to engage in treasonous activities. This shameless behavior determined his fate.

Before 7:00 AM, the entrance of the High Court was crowded with citizens who wanted to attend the hearing. The traffic vehicle of the Capital Police Department went to Laohuqiao at around 6:00 AM. At this time, Zhou Fohai was getting up. Seeing the summons, he quickly put on the newly made gray cloth robe that his wife had sent the night before, and polished his single-shoe-style leather shoes. He said to the bailiff: "Sorry, please wait a moment while I have some breakfast." After speaking, he took out two butter breads, ate them, and then put the two books of ten lines of characters in a yellow leather bag, and put on a gray woolen hat, taking ten minutes. When Zhou Fohai walked out with the bailiff, the other traitors in the same prison, Ding Mocun and Luo Junqiang, said one after another: "Let's watch Lao Zhou first." After the bailiff handed Zhou Fohai over to the High Court's bailiff, the photo reporters took pictures. On the car, Zhou Fohai asked the Chief Zhu: "I'm afraid I'm wearing too many clothes. Can I take them off there?" The Chief replied: "Yes." Then he asked Zhou Fohai: "How is your food handled?" Zhou smiled and said: "It's all sent by my family." His words showed a sense of satisfaction. When the car passed Moshou Road, Chief Zhu said that he had arrived at Moshou Road, and Zhou Fohai actually asked: "Is it still called Moshou Road now?" When he passed the Bank of Communications at Xinjiekou, the Bank of Communications was the former site of the Pseudo Central Reserve Bank. Zhou Fohai stared at the building for a minute, as if with endless emotion.

Moved Out Grain Hidden by the Communist Army to Relieve Refugees

After the situation in northern Jiangsu improved, it greatly benefited Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang economically. Shortly after the canal was opened, the food from Gaoyou and Baoying could be transported to Jiangnan to regulate food supply. After the army marched north, the National Army's military essence could also be supplied locally in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the price of rice in Gaoyou has increased from 10,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan per stone. The autumn harvest this year in the canal and Lixiahe in northern Jiangsu is still good. Although the farmers fled due to the Communist army's oppression and there was insufficient manpower, the local food in the countryside is reportedly not very lacking. The public grain hidden by the Communist army in various places was cleared out and used to relieve refugees, which is a good thing. However, under the Communist Party's high-pressure deception and plunder policy, people were struggling to survive, and both materially and spiritually, they felt endless pain. Going north along the canal from Yangzhou, the residents along the coast, whether in urban or rural areas, and regardless of age, mostly had a pale complexion and were haggard. An old man from a rural area in Gaoyou told the reporter: "Fortunately, the National Army recovered Gaoyou on the 8th of this month. If it had been three days later, all the old men with beards in the county would have been lost because the Communist Party's target of struggle in Gaobao counties had only one 'beard' left." After the beginning of this month, the Communist Party's political workers in Gaoyou shouted the slogan of cleaning up the 鬍子 and struggled against the beards. When the old man said this, his voice trembled.

### Zhou Traitor Looked Up and Not Down; Tripped on the Big Stone Steps

When arriving at the High Court at 8:30, the High Court was already crowded. Zhou Traitor was the second to last to get out of the car, and the citizens scrambled to watch. Zhou Traitor seemed ashamed under the glaring eyes of the crowd. After 10 o'clock, Judge Zhao Chen led the jurors and prosecutors to the court. Zhou Traitor was escorted by four bailiffs and walked out of the waiting room. Zhou Traitor strode high and seemed fearless. But at this time, perhaps because he looked up and not down, he actually tripped on the stone steps. Zhou Traitor walked into the courtroom, stepping onto the dock of the accused. Perhaps the mercury lamps and the tens of thousands of onlookers had taken away his soul. His fat and stiff cheeks and whiskers kept twitching, and his body was also trembling slightly.

Photo reporters began to work busily, magnesium lights illuminated, and the sound of cameras clicked. In the sea of people where movement was difficult, they ran with difficulty. "Fight for the best shot" was their responsibility. Under the dazzling light of the magnesium lamp, Zhou Traitor lowered his proud head, and his face began to flush. On the stage, the prosecutor solemnly stated the main points of the indictment, and the noisy voices of the people drowned out these beautiful and majestic words. Zhou Traitor stretched his head and kept scratching his newly shaved head.

"After the July 7 Incident, the government repeatedly declared its determination to fully resist Japan, and would never stop until the final victory. You are the perennial Minister of Propaganda, you must know this." The judge asked sternly. Zhou Traitor smiled slyly. After a thought, he created a set of novel defenses, saying that although he should bear the responsibility of a traitor in law, but politically, because of the bad political and international situation at that time, he "formed his own" and had a new view.

### Zhou Traitor Confessed; Even if the Law Does Not Sanction, He Feels Uneasy in His Conscience

Zhou Traitor was after all clever. Speaking of this, seeing the color on the court was not right, he knew that the previous propaganda had not achieved the desired effect. So he frowned, quickly turned his head, and put on an artificial tone of regret, he hurriedly said: "Everything was due to the unclear judgment at the time. As soon as I arrived in Nanjing, I knew that I had completely made a mistake." He said: "Secretly leaving Chongqing, even if the law does not sanction it, I feel very uneasy in my conscience. On the contrary, in the five years in Nanjing, even if the law sanctions it, I don't feel any guilt in my conscience." Obviously, Zhou Traitor is a dualist of facts (such as the political situation he said) and law. In his opinion, when the time comes, the law can be thrown to the winds.

### A Strange Clique: The Low-Key Club

Next, Zhou, the traitor, explained to the reporters a specialized term he had pondered for many years – the Low-Key Club. He said: Before the War of Resistance, this was merely a private friendship group without any formal organization. At that time, anyone who frequented his home, such as Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, and others, felt that defeat in the war against Japan was inevitable. Therefore, they derided those who strongly advocated resistance as "talking high." One day, Dr. Hu Shih, during a conversation at his home, casually proposed this peculiar and elegant name, which then spread throughout the country. In reality, it was just a joke.

Zhou, the traitor, was always two-faced. He said that when he served as the Minister of Propaganda in the early stages of the War of Resistance, he secretly advocated peace but never dared to express it. However, when asked in court whether he outwardly advocated resistance while inwardly advocating peace, he revealed an embarrassed expression. He had no response whatsoever. When talking about our sacred Blue Sky with a White Sun flag, he also reluctantly attached a shameful tail to it. Zhou, the traitor, smiled and repeatedly said, "Ashamed, don't mention it!" At this point, order in the courtroom deteriorated beyond repair. A swarm of people crowded into the courtroom, climbing onto the desks. The courtroom was filled with various shouts, and benches and tables were smashed to pieces. Groups of people standing on top of them fell to the ground. Zhou, the traitor, turned his head and looked back, smiling. The reporters, squeezed beyond help, used their backs to resist the crowding mob, continuing to record everything in the courtroom.

Unexpectedly, Zhou, the traitor, even criticized Wang, the traitor, for being dictatorial. According to him, the power to decide on major issues within the puppet organization was almost entirely in the hands of Wang, the traitor. They could only make slight modifications on minor details. For example, the decision on the "Peace Movement" was almost entirely handled by Wang, the traitor, alone. Mentioning the decision on the "Peace Movement" at that time, Zhou, the traitor, added with a smile, "Mr. Chen was even more resolute than Wang, the traitor."

The reporter loved to see that solemn face of President Zhao, upholding justice and fearing nothing. He sternly and solemnly recited Chairman Chiang's announcement at that time, refuting the Konoe Declaration: "The confidence in the War of Resistance cannot be shaken in the slightest, otherwise, they will be eternally guilty of the nation and the country." Under the solemn and righteous declaration, Zhou, the traitor, stammered again.

The court further produced records of Zhou, the traitor's crimes, such as "Japan is sincere," "Resistance will lead to national destruction," and "How painful it was to serve in the central government in the past." Everything was recorded in Zhou, the traitor's booklets, "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Construction" and "Memories and Prospects." In this booklet, Zhou, the traitor, also incidentally criticized President Sun Ke's erroneous international views at the time, but today, with the unfolding of facts; Zhou, the traitor, could only smile bitterly and say, "Now I truly know I was wrong." Furthermore, in this booklet, he even believed that he was the pioneer of the "Peace Movement."

When discussing Zhou, the traitor's large-scale issuance of counterfeit currency and acquisition of legal tender to support the enemy, the presiding judge lamented and narrated the moving stories of the people in the rear, how they died, struggled, worked, and fought under the enemy's relentless bombing. Finally, he rebuked Zhou, the traitor, for disrupting the financial stability of the rear through various methods. This time, it provoked Zhou, the traitor's temper. He loudly said that the court should not "casually" or "presumptuously" speculate about the situation at that time. However, when he realized that the word "casually" might cause displeasure in the court, he hurriedly smiled and corrected himself, saying, "Ah, not casually."

Next, Zhou, the traitor, in an "激昂" tone, delivered a fallacious statement, saying that he stabilized the finance in the occupied area, and that he was not "colluding with the enemy to resist the country," but "colluding with the enemy to save the country."

He also said: "The reserve of the Reserve Bank consists of 50,231 gold bars, 5.3 million US dollars, 7.690 million taels of silver, 330,000 silver dollars, 9.23 million reserve notes, 200,000 Japanese government bonds, and more than 52 million Shanghai original discount notes, as well as other stocks, movable and immovable properties. This reserve has been entirely handed over to the Central Bank of China. The total issue amount of the Reserve Bank is 41 trillion yuan."

### Witness Presents Evidence, Recounts Subversion and Rescue Work

Finally, lawyer Wang Jiaxiang presented sixteen pieces of evidence favorable to Zhou, the traitor, and immediately summoned witnesses. Zhou showed a hint of a smile, gratefully helping them adjust the microphone in front of the witness stand. The first witness was Zhou Hao, who worked for the Military Intelligence Bureau. His relationship with Zhou, the traitor, began in January of the thirty-third year (1944), when he was ordered by the central government to come to the Southeast region to undertake subversion work. After arriving in Nanjing, he contacted Zhou through the introduction of another staff member, Chen Kexiang. Because he was in the enemy-occupied area at that time, his life was unpredictable. Since meeting Zhou, they immediately got along well. With Zhou's help, he was able to infiltrate the puppet government and take office. Also, through Zhou's introduction, he contacted Sun Liangcheng, the Director of Pacification for the puppet regime, and in the thirty-third year, he instigated Sun's army to move from Kaifeng to northern Jiangsu. The second was Wu Huawen (Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army of the puppet regime), subversion. Wu's army moved to the Bengbu area. Again, Zhang Lanfeng (Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army of the puppet regime), Ren Yuandao (Commander-in-Chief of the First Route Army of the puppet regime) all obeyed the central government after subversion work. The above measures were all carried out under my orders for subversion work. He negotiated with Zhou in advance. Zhou used his position as Deputy Director of the Military Committee to avoid enemy suspicion and issue command moves, planning to respond to the central government's counter-offensive, preparing to cover the Allied landing, and preventing the deployment of bandits. Zhou assisted greatly. The court asked Zhou Hao, is everything above true? Are you responsible? "I am willing to take absolute responsibility," he firmly replied.

The second witness, Zhang Shuping, testified that he met Zhou Fohai through the introduction of Tang Mang. After in-depth discussions, he knew that Zhou had regretted his past mistakes. Later, underground work comrade Liu was arrested and was also rescued by Zhou. Liu was a confidant of Gu Zhutong in the Third War Zone. At that time, Zhou appointed Liu as Chief of Staff of the Tax Police Corps. Therefore, Zhou also had liaison and subversion relations with Commander Gu, and Commander Gu can be asked to prove this. The third witness, Mei Siyi, also presented several pieces of evidence favorable to Zhou, and said that in March of the thirty-fourth year (1945), he was ordered by the Commander of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Region to go to Shanghai to discuss with Zhou, the traitor, how to proceed with the subversion work. Zhou, the traitor's attitude was quite sincere. When the court ordered a remand for further hearing, Zhou, the traitor, argued that "The defendant does not accept the charge in the indictment that he jointly colluded with the enemy to conspire to resist the country. After the thirty-third year, the defendant should be described as colluding with this country in the hope of resisting the enemy." This is noteworthy and is also something for the High Court President to study. We await the results of the continued hearing.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Sulfonamides for External Use

— Zhang Ming

Sulfonamide drugs, when used externally for bacterial infections of wounds and various suppurative skin diseases, indeed have various advantages and are much better than ordinary antiseptics. First, sulfonamides have very mild irritation and do not greatly hinder the speed of healing. Second, the antiseptic effect of ordinary antiseptics is very short, while the antiseptic effect of sulfonamides is very long, and their effect can last for one or two days after a single application. Third, sulfonamides, when used externally, have a higher concentration and have an inhibitory effect on various pyogenic bacteria, unlike some antiseptics whose effects are limited to only a few bacteria.

Due to the above advantages, sulfonamide drugs quickly replaced ordinary antiseptics and were widely used locally for various suppurative skin diseases and infections of the eyes, ears, nose, throat, etc. Some are liquids, used to drip into the eyes or nose; some are powders, used to sprinkle on wounds or ulcer surfaces; some are tablets, used to hold in the mouth; and there are even various ointments. There are countless brands on the market. In Shanghai, there are also manufacturers who make sulfathiazole (i.e., Xiaozhilong) into toothpaste, soaps, and other cosmetics, which are heavily marketed to prevent infections of the gums and skin, further extending sulfonamide drugs to everyday products.

However, the external use of sulfonamide drugs is not without danger, and the large-scale overuse as toothpaste and soaps is particularly dangerous. According to reports from scholars in various countries, external use of sulfonamides can easily cause sensitization. Once a patient becomes sensitized, there are various dangers: (1) Various rashes may appear on the skin, and severe cases can even be fatal. For example, Schwartz reported in 1944 that a patient who often used nasal drops containing sulfonamides unknowingly became sensitized. Later, he developed pneumonia, and the doctor, unaware of the sensitization, gave him sulfonamides. This caused a major disaster: the patient developed an extremely severe dermatitis all over his body, with large patches of skin peeling off, and coupled with urinary retention, he quickly died. (2) A small amount of externally applied sulfonamides is also absorbed into the body, and this trace absorption is most likely to cause sensitization. There may be no manifestation at the time, but once a serious infection such as pneumonia or meningitis occurs and sulfonamides are used for treatment, the latent sensitization will greatly manifest, causing various severe reactions. Some directly lead to death (as in the above example), and some prevent the patient from continuing to use the medication and die from incurable pneumonia or meningitis and other severe infectious diseases (there are many more examples that cannot be listed). (3) The last, but also the most dangerous, is the production of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria. After prolonged exposure to sub-inhibitory amounts of sulfonamides, most bacteria develop drug-fastness and can resist the antibacterial effects of sulfonamides. Even large doses are ineffective, and once such bacteria gain an opportunity in the body, they will proliferate uncontrollably, making it impossible to subdue them with sulfonamides. This is not only harmful to the patient but also a great harm to society if transmitted to others.

According to Abramowitz's estimation (1944), this sensitization often occurs. In the same year, Tate and Klorfain's statistics in British military hospitals showed that 3% of those who used sulfonamide drugs externally (mainly sulfanilamide) developed allergic reactions. Among sulfonamide drugs, sulfathiazole (i.e., Xiaozhilong) is particularly likely to cause allergic reactions. According to Darke's report, up to 6% of patients using sulfathiazole ointment developed allergic reactions.

Even very small amounts of locally applied sulfathiazole ointment can cause allergic reactions. Beche reported in January of this year that a patient who had a small boil on his nose applied some sulfathiazole ointment, and the boil healed after four days. Ten days later, a small pimple appeared on his arm, and he applied some ointment in the same way. However, twenty-four hours later, many wheals appeared on the area where the medication was applied and spread to areas where the medication was not applied, and it took several weeks to cure him.

Most patients, and even doctors themselves, are unaware of the various dangers of externally applied sulfonamides. Blaisdell knew of a doctor who often applied sulfathiazole ointment to patients, and some inevitably got on his hands each time. He rubbed his hands together to remove the ointment. As a result, he developed a rash all over his body.

Therefore, the Committee on Drugs and Chemistry of the American Medical Association published a report last year detailing the dangers of external use of sulfonamides, which aroused the attention of the medical community. They loudly called for opposing the indiscriminate use of sulfonamide drugs on the skin or mucous membranes and advocated that pharmacies should only sell sulfonamide drugs based on a doctor's prescription, and should not allow patients to purchase drugs for self-treatment. At the same time, they also advised doctors not to use sulfonamide topical medications casually, and if they have to risk using them due to a severe infection, they should not use them for more than five days. As for the daily use of sulfonamide toothpaste and sulfonamide soaps, they should of course be banned. In the United States, several states have now used laws to prohibit the public sale of sulfonamide topical medications without a doctor's prescription. It is hoped that our country's health authorities will also take appropriate measures to increase public safety.

### Digestive Ulcer Sound

— Xia Zhenyi

Psychological Factors in Treatment

We firmly believe that emotional factors have a great impact on the persistence of symptoms and the hindrance of recovery in patients with peptic ulcers, especially in today's highly stressful society. We pay more attention to their psychological factors!

I have always felt that the greatest difficulty in psychological adjuvant therapy is that mental health cannot be achieved in a short period, and it is believed that each patient has different psychological problems and needs individual thinking, analysis and training. Therefore, some scholars have conducted very precise psychological research on many wealthy patients using individual approaches. If each patient has different psychological problems, then using individual approaches will have great effects. However, the result is that those patients did not get slight psychological improvement. Although we don’t have experimental evidence, we can believe that the main psychological factors of each patient have more commonality than individual particularity. We can see that all patients have the same symptoms: such as indigestion, extreme hunger, easy fear and anger, constipation and increased sensitivity to pain. As for the psychological aspect, there are also many commonalities: (1) Patients often feel mentally depressed, lazy, irritable, and have infinite difficulty in thinking. (2) They often use ill health as the focus of their conversations with relatives and friends. (3) They often want to use willpower to overcome their situation.

When emotions are tense, gastrointestinal movement speeds up, spasms, relaxation, and reduced blood circulation. These have a considerable relationship to the health of the gastrointestinal tract, because the healing of peptic ulcers is due to the formation of fibrous tissue in the affected area. This change is entirely a metabolic process. In a suitable environment, the affected area will heal itself. The suitable conditions are rest and sufficient blood circulation in the affected area. We know that physical rest and emotional tension are mutually exclusive. The body absolutely cannot rest when the brain is extremely stimulated and excited. Because the brain is often in a state of unpleasant emotions, it will stimulate the efferent nerves. Therefore, if they can avoid or reduce excessive emotions, the disease will not be difficult to heal on its own.

We cannot forget the close relationship between mind and body. When treating an internal medicine disease, we cannot ignore the psychological factors, especially for the treatment of peptic ulcers. In addition to medication and diet therapy, we must also pay attention to psychological therapy. The following are a few common principles on which psychological therapy is based:

(1) Suppression of worries: There are many ways to eliminate worries and boredom. The simplest and most direct method is to have patients learn some enjoyable activities or pastimes to replace boring thoughts. Later, appropriately guide patients to recall the most pleasant events in their past lives. Whenever they are bored and unhappy, they should try their best to recall those sweet and happy situations in the past. For most patients, childhood memories are of great help. This makes the bored mood disappear, and the heart is always filled with a source of joy and pleasure. Patients initially find it inconvenient to change their thinking, but after a few days of practice, they can cope with ease.

(2) Suppression of discussion: It is not difficult to suppress patients from often using difficulties as the focus of their discussions with relatives and friends, because if they know that this has an impact on the recovery of their condition, they can control themselves very well. However, the most important thing is to get the cooperation of their family members and friends. Relatives and friends should avoid talking about difficult things as much as possible. Whenever the patient is angry, the mother or wife should remind, hint, or advise him, so as to reduce emotional tension.

(3) Suppression of striving: Patients often want to use striving or willpower to overcome special situations, but they often become irritable because they cannot find a solution. This is a big disadvantage, because striving is contrary to the rest of the internal organs. Therefore, reduce or avoid striving as much as possible, and often guide them not to think about their troubles or use their emotions excessively. There are many special circumstances that patients have to pay attention to. The following is a very common example:

For example, the patient has developed a habit – when he goes to bed, there must always be a glass of milk on the table as a pain reliever when he is awakened by pain at night. Although he feels that this is a bad habit and should be removed, he still has some inclination towards this glass of milk in his heart. These two concepts are fighting in his brain, and he feels that he is too useless and too weak, and he does not have the determination to make a decision on this little thing. So he encourages himself and suppresses himself. This tendency to self-determination is the expression of using willpower or striving to solve difficulties. Therefore, whenever he has a slight inclination towards milk, he must do what he should do, regardless of whether he actually needs it. In fact, this habit is not very meaningful and important. What should be noted is that when he goes to bed, he should not have the fear of nighttime stomach pain and the absence of milk in his heart. In that way, if there is food that he dare not eat, it is best to avoid it or not eat it. When he wants to eat a certain food, he can eat a little bit, so that the fear is reduced, and the confidence in his own stomach strength is enhanced.

(4) Explanation talk: Give the patient a 45-minute psychological talk every day, expounding the nature of thoughts, the impact on physical activities and daily life, the source of ideas and the relationship of emotional reactions, and often praising the value and effectiveness of drug and diet therapy. From these talks and explanations, the patient can understand himself, improve himself and maintain health.

(5) Self-suggestion: We know that the patient's psychology has a great impact on health, but they often feel negative and pessimistic. This gray outlook on life should be broken, and an optimistic and positive outlook on life must be established. Therefore, the patient must always be confident that his condition has gradually recovered. Whenever he goes to bed at night or has not gotten up in the early morning, repeat the phrases suggested by Mr. Coue: "Day by day, every day, my health is improving." (Day by day, every day, I am getting better & better). We firmly believe that the patient's self-confidence and thought change training are the two major elements to promote recovery.

(6) Inductive suggestion: Use inductive methods to make patients produce a kind of self-confidence. Mr. Bernbelu calls it inductive suggestion. This self-confidence includes digestion, absorption, sleep, activities, elimination of emotional tension and pain, and correction of constipation.

According to the results of the experiments of M.N. Chappell: J.J. Stefons and others, they claim that common psychological training can not only improve symptoms, but also help patients enjoy a healthy life for at least three years. Therefore, I am specially introducing it here. I hope that internists will not ignore the psychological factors of these patients when treating them.

### The Battle Between Humans and Germs (7)

— Qiao Shumin

Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management"

In the past, our management of infectious diseases has largely been a history of failures. This is because the true nature of infectious diseases was not fully understood in the past, and the measures taken were inevitably empty and impractical. Now that this publication has explained the three elements of infectious diseases in the thirteenth issue, it is appropriate to use the scientific methods we know to target these three elements and seek to eliminate and control them. Generally, cutting off one of the three elements of infection is sufficient to achieve prevention and control. From the perspective of human resources and economics, we should adapt to local conditions and to the times, starting from the easiest and most effective points. We know that our current knowledge is still very lacking, and future generations will look at us as we look at the past. However, at the current stage, we can only do this much, so that our country can effectively implement measures, and it is hoped that the unjust deaths and illnesses caused by infectious diseases can be reduced by more than half.

I. Curbing the Source of Infection

Suppressing the source of infection is the key strategy for infectious disease management, akin to "drawing firewood from under the cauldron." There are six main methods for suppressing the source of infection:

(1) Reporting - "Reporting" refers to the immediate reporting of any discovered cases of infectious diseases to the local health authorities.

A. When to Report - Reporting should be done as early as possible, and it should also be complete.

B. Who Should Report - In European and American countries, hospitals and private practitioners are generally responsible for reporting infectious diseases. In our country, the number of hospitals and doctors is too small, and other institutions and personnel are urgently needed to participate and assist.

C. Which Diseases to Report - Currently, only ten types of infectious diseases are designated as legally notifiable infectious diseases and must be reported: (1) Smallpox (2) Scarlet fever (3) Diphtheria (4) Epidemic Meningitis (5) Plague (6) Cholera (7) Typhoid and Paratyphoid fever (8) Bacillus dysentery (9) Typhus fever (10) Relapsing fever.

D. What to Report - The content of the report should be as concise as possible so as not to bore and discourage the reporter, especially since not all reporters in our country are technical personnel.

(2) Investigation - Investigation work should begin immediately after receiving the report.

A. Purpose of Investigation - Before starting the investigation, it is best to make the investigator understand the purpose of the investigation, so that the results can be more satisfactory.

B. Investigators - Usually,

(1) Public health nurses - are the main investigators, but

(2) Physicians

(3) Health inspectors, engineers

(4) Other personnel - are also sometimes needed.

C. Content of Investigation - The content of the investigation naturally varies with the type of infectious disease. The first investigation should be the most detailed. Regardless of the nature of the disease, the purpose of the investigation is generally focused on discovering the source of infection. Therefore, the following seven items are mostly indispensable:

1. Name of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)
2. Gender of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)
3. Age of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)
4. Occupation of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)
5. Past medical history of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)
6. Source of the patient's daily diet
7. Possible opportunities for infection for the patient

(3) Isolation - "Isolation" refers to the separation of patients with infectious diseases in designated places, so that the pathogens they carry no longer have the opportunity to infect others. This is indeed an important measure for the management of infectious diseases. If the first case can be strictly isolated, the disease can be prevented from spreading. Isolation is especially valuable for the prevention and control of rapid infectious diseases such as smallpox, cholera, plague, and typhus. However, for infectious diseases that are difficult to diagnose early and have early infectiousness, such as measles and pertussis, isolation is not easy to be effective. There are two types of isolation: home isolation and hospital isolation.

A. Home Isolation - The following points should be noted:

(1) For home isolation, there should be two rooms dedicated to isolating the patient, preferably upstairs.

(2) All items such as clothing, furniture, and utensils that the patient does not need should be removed in advance.

(3) The door should be closed or hung with a gauze curtain.

(4) The window should be opened to allow air circulation, and it should be screened to prevent the entry and exit of flies and mosquitoes. If there are already mosquitoes, flies, lice, etc. in the room, they should be killed immediately.

(5) Except for medical and nursing staff, no one else is allowed to enter. Medical and nursing staff must strictly pay attention to disinfection, hand washing, and changing clothes (isolation gowns).

(6) The patient's clothing and utensils must not be taken out of the room before disinfection.

(7) The patient's excrement, nasal mucus, sputum, and other filth should be disinfected, incinerated, or buried.

(8) Family members and guests are not allowed to visit the patient. If necessary, they can only speak softly through the curtain.

(9) When the patient recovers and no longer carries germs, he should take a bath and change clothes before going out.

Except for a few wealthy families who can hope to achieve this kind of home isolation, most families find it difficult to do so. However, even if this kind of isolation is not perfect, it is better than nothing. If the situation permits, it is best to send the patient to a hospital for isolation, which is not only complete but also provides proper treatment.

B. Hospital Isolation

(1) Infectious Disease Hospital or Isolation Hospital - This is a hospital dedicated to isolating and treating patients with infectious diseases. Every city should establish one.

1. Site Selection - The site should be high and dry, easy to drain, not located in a crowded area (residents within half a mile should not exceed six hundred), and the traffic should still be convenient.

2. Bed Allocation - Generally, one bed should be set up for every thousand people, but each hospital should not have less than twelve beds. More beds are more economical. Each bed should occupy 144 square feet of floor space and 6,000 cubic feet of fresh air per hour.

3. Bedside Isolation -

(1) Nursing and medical staff must wear isolation gowns and disinfect and wash their hands immediately after any direct or indirect contact with the patient.

(2) All clothing and utensils used by each patient must be strictly disinfected and limited to the use of that one patient.

(3) All excrement, nasal mucus, sputum, and other items from the patient must be strictly disinfected, incinerated, or buried.

(4) The distance between beds should be more than 10 feet to prevent droplet infection.

4. Staffing - The number of staff depends on the size of the facility.

B. Alternatives to Isolation Hospitals - In some environments, a fixed isolation hospital cannot be established, or some infectious diseases do not need to be sent to a hospital for isolation, so we should find a way to replace it. There are usually several of the following that can be used:

1. Borrowing temples and ancestral halls

2. Temporarily renting private houses

3. Utilizing the patient's house

### Possessing Every Grace

— Sun Fuxi

Preface to the Study of Expression

Human faces are different, each like its heart. Because spirit is the face of the heart, having a heart is the origin of spirit. Therefore, facial appearance and demeanor, even the slightest word or movement, all come from the heart. Correcting words and actions can also correct the wickedness of the heart.

Often, fashionable beauties, at first glance, inspire respect and admiration. However, a single smile or word can reveal their depth or superficiality.

Our country has always valued etiquette. Whether solemn or lively, each has its strengths. Recently, the atmosphere has been poor, and education has been lacking, resulting in the majority of people seen in society being vulgar in speech and action, and flustered in demeanor. They can neither maintain the inherent solemnity of China, nor match the vitality of Europe and America. I am especially raising this issue and doing preliminary research.

The study of expression is a comprehensive blend of physiology, psychology, literature, and aesthetics. It makes a great contribution to literary description, pictorial representation, and theatrical performance, and is indispensable in daily life. European youths often have experts to guide them in practicing expressions in front of a mirror, so that they can be moderate in their dealings with people and things, so as not to lose their composure. Few people in our country pay attention to this, so there are no good teachers or good books to seek. To study this, one must always pay attention, in theaters, restaurants, streetcars, and on the road, observing the words and actions around, and investigating the causes and consequences of one's own words and actions. For example, at a gathering, observe the guests, some are silent and calm, some are jumping and laughing, and then analyze the reasons for one's own restraint and boredom, and the impact of one's own cheerful conversation on the environment at that time. We can discover many expressions that are like crying but not crying, like laughing but not laughing, and inappropriate expressions of crying and laughing.

Therefore, to seek progress, the first is the problem of knowledge. We must learn to know the standards of right and wrong. Second, and more importantly, is the problem of thought. If we have a righteous heart and deep love for humanity, we will not have expressions of contempt and disdain. Third, there is a more significant problem in the Chinese nation, which is the problem of physical strength. The reason why many Chinese people do not abide by morality and laws is that their physical constitution is too weak. "It is not that they do not want to advance, but their bodies cannot bear it." At public gatherings, they yawn, stretch, want to sit down after standing, and want to sleep after sitting. As a result, they leave before the end of the event. Based on the above three points, and then combining the standards of aesthetic education, we can hope to have moderate speech and laughter, and possess every grace.

This will not only add a lot of face to the country and the nation, but also, for the individual, enhance their status, reduce misunderstandings, and be of great help in their career.

### Where is Beauty?

— Shusun Ruying

When we talk about art, we talk about beauty. Beauty is the essence of art, and aesthetic behavior is artistic behavior. A healthy life is a model of beauty, and a work of art is a crystallization of beauty. However, where does beauty, this elusive and mysterious thing, actually exist?

When we are admiring scenery, we praise, "This is truly beautiful!" When we are admiring a painting, we praise, "This is truly beautiful!" When we see a triumphant warrior returning home and his old mother who has been waiting for him leaning against the door, embracing each other and crying bitterly, we also secretly praise in our hearts, "This is truly beautiful!" We find traces of beauty everywhere, but we are never able to grasp the essence of beauty.

Where is beauty? Does it exist in the object, or does it exist in the heart?

If you say that beauty exists in the object, in natural scenery, in works of art, in the generous and tragic behavior of human beings, then I must ask you, why does a farmer who is busy all year round never find the beauty of the mountains and rivers in front of his village? Why are works of art just like goods in the eyes of an antique dealer who makes a living by buying and selling old calligraphy and paintings? In the minds of a group of brave men who are charging towards the enemy under a hail of bullets, why does the excitement and tension overwhelm all feelings, and there is no talk of beauty or ugliness at all?

Take a famous painting as an example. This painting is regarded as a treasure in the hands of a collector, but in the eyes of a poor person who is not clothed and fed, this painting is not as valuable as a piece of bread. Even if this painting falls into the hands of a vulgar nouveau riche, he may regret that the light ink bamboo in the painting is not as auspicious as the figures of Fu, Lu, and Shou. Moreover, when Beaumarchais' comedy "The Marriage of Figaro" was published, French critics unanimously condemned it as vulgar and mediocre, but after several performances, it finally received unanimous praise. Even critics cannot see the beauty of a good work of art. Then, to say that beauty exists in the object, or rather, to say that beauty exists in the heart of the appreciator is more accurate.

But to say that beauty exists in the heart also has some major misunderstandings. A bad painting will never become more beautiful because the person appreciating it is a poet. A blank piece of paper is just a blank piece of paper in the eyes of a painter, and cannot make him have a feeling of beauty. For a person who knows how to appreciate, he has a higher standard for beauty, and he is unwilling to look at general works of art. Things that ordinary people think are beautiful, he often finds extremely ugly. The reason why beauty is beautiful is definitely not a one-sided illusion of appreciation. Therefore, we cannot believe the saying that beauty exists in the heart.

Beauty does not exist in the object, nor does it exist in the heart. So, where does beauty actually exist?

When our heart comes into contact with external objects, we become aware. The heart observes, the object is observed, the heart evaluates, and the object is evaluated. When this act of observation or evaluation occurs, beauty, or ugliness, appears.

From this, we can know that beauty is neither the measure of the heart nor the attribute of the object, but simply a harmonious unity of the heart and the object. Beauty only has the possibility of appearing when the heart and the object intersect. Just like "There are steeds, and then there are masters of equitation (Bo Le)." Even if there are steeds, without a master of equitation, the steeds cannot be called steeds. Even if it is a work of art, if there is no appreciator, the beauty of the work of art is buried in vain, and cannot be said to exist.

Moreover, even if the heart and the object enter the aesthetic realm when they intersect, the value judgment of beauty often varies from person to person. Taking reading poetry as an example, some people like Tao Yuanming, and some people are fond of Li Yishan, and believe that what they love is beautiful, and what they do not love is not beautiful. The so-called beauty here is subjective beauty. Subjective beauty may appear as long as the heart and the object intersect and an aesthetic act occurs. Therefore, cigarette advertisement paintings are also beautiful in the hearts of elementary school students, and the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea are also beautiful in the hearts of the tutors in rural schools. However, this beauty does not necessarily conform to objective standards, and is not the main object of study for researchers of aesthetics.

The search for objective standards of beauty is one of the main tasks of those who study aesthetics, but this standard is very difficult to determine. Moreover, the so-called objective beauty here is only relative objective beauty. The existence of objective beauty must also be at the time of the intersection of the heart and the object, but it needs to be accompanied by additional conditions, and it needs to be in a state of unity between the subject and the object, so that objective beauty can be recognized.

### Awakening Thoughts (Sculpture)

### An Old Woman Playing the Qin — Yangzhou Continued Dream, Four —

— Hong Weifa

"Lowering her eyebrows, she plucks the strings continuously, telling all the infinite things in her heart." This is the mournful voice of a merchant's wife on the Xunyang River. However, in this mournful voice, there is only resentment and hatred of separation. As for her sense of twilight and the suffering of sinking, it seems that there is a world of difference compared to the old woman playing the qin on the Slender West Lake.

The old woman playing the qin on the Slender West Lake often plays and sings in Luyang Village. Many old tea drinkers say that she was originally a famous courtesan in her youth. Why didn't she find a home while time hadn't taken away her beauty? Even "marrying an old man to a merchant" was impossible. The old men lamented and said, "She was really too popular at that time. She always thought that flowers could bloom forever and the moon could be full forever!"

She has been singing for a long time in Luyang Village. At first, she seemed to be still a fading beauty. Classical costumes, combined with the remaining charm, can make people reminiscent of the prosperity of the Silk Willow City in the past. Therefore, there were still many tea drinkers who spent money to have her play and sing every day. She plays the moon qin and sings outdated songs, like the cuckoo crying at night and the cicada singing in late autumn, which is enough to make the audience's hearts churn. However, time is forcing her to imitate, and after the remaining charm has disappeared, the tea drinkers who want her to play and sing have also decreased. So she has to automatically play and sing in front of many tea drinkers. After playing and singing for a while, she automatically asks the tea drinkers for a few cents. Begging is not easy. She doesn't know how many cold stares she has received, and she doesn't know how many smiles she has given to people. Later, the tea drinkers' attitude towards her seems to have become worse as she became older and uglier. So when she plays and sings, she shrinks to the side, and almost doesn't dare to face the tea drinkers, just wanting to use her suppressed singing to arouse some compassionate feelings in others.

However, although she was abandoned by many tea drinkers, some older people still seemed to have some old feelings for her that had not been completely destroyed. This is a common occurrence. When the setting sun passes over the western mountains, the twilight is vast, and gradually encompasses the earth, she tidies up the moon qin, and with a tired and disappointed expression, when she is about to leave Luyang Village, she will encounter some old tea drinkers, ask about her singing situation, shake her head and sigh for her, and even greet the waiter to prepare some refreshments for her to eat. "Thank you very much, Old Master!" she says, and at the same time casts a flirtatious look at the old man. The old man also stroked his beard and smiled. At this time, the old woman playing the qin and the old man both seemed to have returned to their youth, and were warming up their youthful dreams. Unfortunately, this beautiful dream will eventually wake up! Today, the old woman playing the qin and those old tea drinkers are no longer seen on the Slender West Lake. They should have abandoned the lakes and mountains and are sleeping underground!

### Tolstoy Quotes

— Fengtian

A person can be happy forever only by living for others. Sacrifice and suffering are the fate of thinkers and artists, because their purpose is to seek the happiness of all mankind.

The real cause of poverty is the wealth accumulated in the hands of those who do not engage in production but concentrate in the cities.

Forced education methods can never produce the people needed by people, but only the people needed by degenerate societies.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 72

— Ye Jingfeng

In our office, almost everyone was doing something to kill time. Some were smoking cigarettes, blowing out one circle after another; some were writing diaries or something; some were turning the newspaper upside down, looking for something to read; some were fixing their eyes on the ceiling, as if a movie was being projected on it; some were leaving their seats in a hurry, running through the rooms, maybe to go to the toilet, and then hurrying back. And so on, and so on. However, every minute or two, someone would look at the clock on the wall, checking it against their own watch or pocket watch; there were fifteen minutes, fourteen minutes, thirteen minutes, twelve minutes left...

But when the clock on the wall was clearly seven or eight minutes away from five o'clock, suddenly, we heard a deafening explosion, right near our office, and even the glass window panes shook with a "bang"; everyone exclaimed "Huh" in unison. This was the signal we had agreed upon to take action. Why was it seven or eight minutes early? We may still not find the reason now; according to the person in charge of this matter, he said afterwards that he had indeed given the order on time, and he had left the headquarters an hour before, and had checked the time before leaving. When the people who came to question him compared their watches, they were all exactly the same. This matter was really inexplicable.

As soon as the signal cannon sounded, the captain looked at the clock on the wall, and then looked at his own watch, frowned, and immediately waved his hand. Hu Di and I immediately jumped up from the building, left the office, and took the six messengers who were waiting outside, and set off in two cars. The puppet public mansion was at most five or six minutes away from us. When we were still some distance away, we had already heard gunfire erupting, and the puppet public mansion was on fire. At this time, the sky was not yet bright, and although it was dim, everything could still be seen vaguely, but some places and things were instead made somewhat dim by the fire. About three or four hundred yards away from the puppet public mansion, the road was already chaotic, and the streets and alleys were filled with all kinds of people, running around, some in military uniforms, some civilians, and some security guards.

Although it was chaotic, the martial law situation had already been established, and security team squads were stationed at each important intersection to carry out defenses. Anyone without the special armband issued by our headquarters was not allowed to pass. These people crowded in the streets and alleys were originally somewhat inexplicable about this action, but in a few minutes, our propaganda squads lurking in various districts had used the fastest distribution method to spread our printed "Proclamation to the Citizens," and everyone knew what was going on, so they followed the instructions on the proclamation, and everyone first sorted out a blue sky and white sun national flag and quickly hung it at their door.

Hu Di and I saw that the car was difficult to pass for a while, so we instructed the driver to park the car on the side of the road to wait. We each took out our weapons and got out of the car on foot. When we arrived at the puppet public mansion, we found the person in charge of the command and learned that things were going extremely smoothly. They were now deploying the surrendering guards, counting documents, and so on; at the same time, they were also assigning people to put out the fire and deploy defenses. Immediately, I quickly wrote a report, and Hu Di and I signed it, and assigned two messengers to report to the headquarters.

"Report!" At this time, Hu Di suddenly stood at attention to me and gave a military salute; this was the first time he had done this since he took office, and he did it quite well; he must have practiced a lot in secret. But I didn't expect it for a moment and was startled. "Reporting to the captain, - I want to go over there to catch thieves." "Over there" was pointing to the residences of the rebellious figures.

I thought that arresting the treacherous Yin was also an urgent matter, and it was indeed necessary to go help, so I agreed to let him go quickly, and instructed him not to be greedy for credit, because there were people specifically responsible for searching the rebellious residences and arresting the treacherous figures. We were just providing some assistance. I also instructed him to return to headquarters at exactly six o'clock, where we would meet and go outside the city. I also repeatedly instructed him not to lose contact.

### Ants and Aphids

— Shaofu

If you enjoy rights, you must fulfill obligations.

Let's look at the ants in the biological world.

Ants can cohabit with other small creatures, such as beetles and other insects, spiders, land crustaceans, etc., and the most common is cohabitation with aphids. What is the state of their cohabitation? According to the results of biologists' investigations:

Ants use the two antennae on their heads to rub the back of the aphid, causing the aphid to secrete sugar, and then take the opportunity to lick it. But ants can drive away the enemies of aphids, protect aphids, and sometimes even take the eggs of aphids and move them into their nest. After winter, when the spring warms up, they move the hatched young aphids to the tender buds of plants. If they encounter harsh weather, they move the young aphids back into the nest to take temporary shelter.

Ants are so busy, responsible, and fulfilling their obligations in order to lick a little sugar on the back of the grasshopper (which they rub out with their own antennae).

Killing chickens to eat eggs is even more out of the question. Today, there are many such cruel and foolish people in society.

Social Problem Data

### Mediation for Divorce

— Chai Fei

Mediation institutions for marital disputes are not yet common in our country. Such disputes should not be entirely brought to court. It falls within the scope of social services, and the social service agencies established by the Ministry of Social Affairs in various regions should take on the task of marital mediation. The case of Chen Jizheng suing Sa Benju and Shi Biren for adultery and disrupting the family (the so-called "Anti-Japanese War Wife" case) ultimately ended up in court. In a healthy society, the preliminary handling of this case should have been done by a social service organization.

In the United States, there are specialized agencies for marital mediation, and some even consider it a lifelong vocation. The best marital mediation work is generally recognized to be done by the Family Dispute Mediation Department in Milwaukee. Mrs. Nippert, the head of the department, has reconciled estranged couples and achieved better results than any other American in this field.

She says, "Many divorces are caused by illness, which prevents them from engaging in normal occupational activities, and each case needs to be handled individually." It is clear that she does not emphasize the superficial reasons for marital disputes. Her work can be said to benefit more than just Milwaukee. Sociologists warn us that wartime divorce cases are surging, reaching the point where nearly one in five American couples are divorcing, but Milwaukee has been trying to turn the tide with significant results. Judges and social service agencies in cities across the United States, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Australia have requested Mrs. Nippert to provide them with reference materials to help them organize similar marital mediation agencies.

What Causes Couples to Fall Out? A Broken Mirror Can Be Mended.

Before Mrs. Nippert took over, only one in fifteen marital dispute mediations in Milwaukee was successful. Now, almost half of the families on the verge of breaking up are reconciled through mediation. According to officials in Milwaukee's Civil Affairs Department, "The $37,000 annual budget we give to the mediation department led by Mrs. Nippert is truly the best investment the city government has made."

How does Mrs. Nippert approach her mediation work? For example, when a couple like the Schoberts comes to the mediation department, Mrs. Nippert asks:

"Why do you want a divorce?"

"He's a drunk, often threatening me and hitting me right on the nose," the wife complained.

"She's always spitting on me and wants to leave me!" the husband defended himself. "The pastor at the church told us to come see you."

Mrs. Nippert nods, not surprised. Of the ten thousand divorce cases handled by Mrs. Nippert and her twelve assistants, about one-third are referred by pastors, relatives, or even judges. Another third are referred by the Milwaukee Family Court. The rest are couples who come to the department voluntarily seeking mediation.

Mrs. Nippert asks in a sympathetic tone, discovering that the root cause of the Schoberts' divorce is that the husband is not very successful in his job at the factory, so he drinks to forget his troubles and often argues with his wife. The wife endured it for a month before finally losing her temper and wanting a divorce.

Using Psychological Tests to Study the Causes of Divorce

"I think," Mrs. Nippert says calmly, "Mr. Schobert's job is the main reason for your wanting a divorce." Both of the Schoberts look at her in confusion. She then asks a volunteer psychologist to test Mr. Schobert's work ability.

The psychologist's test results show that Mr. Schobert is not suitable for working as a machinist; during his free time, he relieves his depression by fixing cars. Now he has become the head of the repair shop, has almost quit drinking, and gets along very well with his wife.

Mrs. Nippert sometimes discovers the crux of the problem from the testimonies of the children of divorcing couples. A high school student described the heartbreaking family situation: "Dad is as honest as an old shoe, but Mom often leaves him to go to clubs and fashionable social gatherings, mingling with those she considers respectable people. Dad, however, prefers to hide in the basement playing with his beloved rocking horse. They think they should get a divorce because someone is pursuing Mom. But Mom and Dad really love each other."

So Mrs. Nippert offers the divorcing couple this advice: "The husband should accompany his wife to social gatherings once a week; the wife, in turn, should encourage her husband to play with his rocking horse, but shouldn't always nag him about constantly mingling with so-called respectable people." The result is also very effective.

Later, two girls told Mrs. Nippert that their father always listened to his grandmother when handling family matters, which often led to quarrels with their mother. Mrs. Nippert then advised the man to see a psychiatrist. After learning the reasons for his unhappy family life, he began to realize that he was forty years old and should make his own decisions about everything. From then on, he never mentioned the word divorce again.

Wife Not Bearing Sons Affects Marital Relationship

Mrs. Nippert believes that the first thing to investigate when looking into the causes of divorce is the health of the husband or wife. A young woman suffering from migraines once complained to Mrs. Nippert that she could no longer live with her husband. Mrs. Nippert asked a psychiatrist to advise her to live comfortably, get enough sleep, and participate less in dances and club activities. Six weeks later, her condition improved, and she realized that she also had to take responsibility for the marital conflicts.

A couple often quarreled because the wife could not have children, and a neighbor went to Mrs. Nippert for help. As a result, a psychiatrist pointed out that they should adopt a child, and the quarrels stopped.

Economic difficulties often lead to divorce. Mrs. Nippert always advises people not to get divorced impulsively. If the family's finances are currently tight, forming a second family after divorce will not necessarily improve the situation, and the cost of divorce is at least $500 each time.

The biggest difficulty Mrs. Nippert faces in her mediation work is the relentless attacks from greedy judges and lawyers, who accuse her and her assistants of being "despicable intruders into the private lives of Milwaukee families." But in reality, she is, as she herself says, a social worker. Since her husband died in World War I, she has been engaged in marital mediation, and to date, a total of ten thousand couples have been saved from the brink of disaster through her mediation. No matter how strong the difficulties she encounters, she still works tirelessly. She says that now she is busy all day, starting her second ten thousand mediation cases.

The experience of foreigners makes us feel that dealing with anything in today's world cannot be separated from science, and those engaged in social service work in China should pay more attention to this.

### The So-Called "Anti-Japanese War Wife"

— Sheng Jie

The so-called "Anti-Japanese War Wife" case, which was highly valued by the people of Shanghai, has come to an end with the first instance verdict that Sa Benju and Shi Biren were each sentenced to four months of imprisonment for adultery (and mutual adultery).

The plaintiff still wants to appeal, and the outcome is still unknown. However, this verdict only addresses the act of adultery itself. How these one man and two women will handle their future relationship is a matter of fact, and it may become a de facto one husband and two wives situation. If so, they are probably more troubled than happy. I dare not talk about right and wrong, I just feel like how should this kind of problem be handled well?

First of all, I think the so-called "Anti-Japanese War Wife" is a bit of a fabricated term. The law clearly states that they committed adultery, but in reality, they are praised as "Anti-Japanese War Wife". I don't know which "Anti-Japanese War Husband" concocted this. I guess the intention is to reduce their legal responsibility. Therefore, the defense lawyer in the Sa case simply made a "tangential" defense in court, saying that the defendant was ordered by ××× to do this and that, and had contributed to the Anti-Japanese War, which could be used as a reference for the trial, which is extremely far-fetched!

Furthermore, the original wife who stayed in the occupied area is generally referred to as the "Occupied Wife". I don't know how this came about. In fact, it is inappropriate to put the word "occupied" before "wife". Who did she fall into the hands of? After the victory, it should be "recovered"! If we say that the wife stayed in the occupied area and did not fall into anyone's hands and waited bitterly for dawn, but once dawn broke, the husband brought back a "wife" wearing an "Anti-Japanese War" hat, and at the same time regarded his original wife as an "occupied" "wife", it is really a violation of loyalty and integrity and is unacceptable!

Similar cases occur due to wartime displacement and need not be seen as very serious. However, if we create terms and regard "adultery between people with spouses" as a tacitly approved and legitimate matter, it will inevitably affect the proper order of social organization! In the first instance, the Sa Shi case could be settled with a "fine of 120,000 yuan". Whether this is reasonable or not, we (outsiders to the law) do not need to make arbitrary judgments. What must be pointed out is that the trend of creating terms must not be allowed to spread! I believe that in many so-called "Anti-Japanese War Wife" cases, many of the protagonists (indulgent men) would commit adultery even if they did not fight in the Anti-Japanese War.

### A Notable Figure in the Balkans: Turkish President İnönü

— Mi Shan

The Soviet-Turkish relationship, which has attracted worldwide attention, has deteriorated further due to the dispute over the Dardanelles Strait. Turkey's response to the Soviet Union has been published, firmly rejecting joint control of the Straits. The subsequent development of the situation concerns the safety of the entire Europe, and all parties are paying great attention to it. During the war, Turkey was in a state of siege on all sides, but it still refused to yield and adhered to neutrality, which ultimately restrained Hitler's ambitions. After the war, it still navigated between the great powers in a tense atmosphere, and always handled the situation with ease without suffering any losses. Therefore, everyone admires the person who holds the reins of the country, a very capable and sophisticated figure.

Turkish leader İsmet İnönü is the successor of former Turkish President Atatürk and one of the two great founding fathers of Turkey. His original name was İsmet Pasha, but his current name represents a glorious victory. During the Turkish-Greek War of 1921-1922, he led the Turkish army to an unprecedented victory in the İnönü region. To commemorate his military achievements, the place name was made his surname.

İnönü was born in 1884 and graduated from military school in 1906. Before he was twenty years old, he was already the leader of a secret party that overthrew Turkey. During the Russo-Turkish War in 1916, he met Atatürk in the army, and from then on, they formed a lasting friendship. He served as Atatürk's chief of staff at the time. His military achievements in the İnönü region during the Turkish-Greek War laid the foundation for his future career. After the victory of the Turkish-Greek War, he was sent to Switzerland as a representative for peace negotiations. He transformed from a soldier into a politician and diplomat.

From 1923, he served as Prime Minister for six consecutive years. In 1938, after Atatürk passed away, the National Assembly elected him to succeed as President. He was re-elected in 1943. In the general election in Turkey in August of this year, İnönü won seven-eighths of the votes with the campaign slogan "Don't change horses midstream," and was elected for another term.

İnönü's personality is completely opposite to that of Atatürk. Everyone knows that Atatürk was a passionate, courageous, and flamboyant person. His completion of the revolution and promotion of the reform movement was like a storm. İnönü, on the other hand, likes to be calm. He has the ability to "not seek recognition and listen without speaking." Patience and politeness are the secrets to his success. When dealing with enemies, he will pretend to be a paper tiger until the end. Even when fighting with powerful countries, he is still amiable and polite on the surface, but he always insists on his own views and refuses to change them.

Little is known about İnönü's private life. It is not easy to find his trace in public gatherings. When he does appear, he is always wearing a neat English-style suit. He has a very happy family with three children. He usually likes to ride horses. He does not drink alcohol at all, and even at social gatherings, it is rare for him to drink a glass of wine.

Turkey does not have a strong military backing, and its geographical location straddles Europe and Asia. In particular, the Dardanelles Strait, which controls the passage from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, is a strategic location that the great powers must compete for. If the rulers are not careful, they are in danger of being caught in a war. İnönü's foreign policy has always been to take advantage of the conflicts between European powers to allow Turkey to "reap the benefits." He strives to liaise with the United States and Britain, and strives to continue to maintain Turkey's exclusive defense of the Dardanelles Strait. Due to his thorough handling and smooth skills, the small and weak Turkey has gradually gained international attention. Atatürk often praised him during his lifetime: "İnönü is the most sophisticated person in Turkey!"
