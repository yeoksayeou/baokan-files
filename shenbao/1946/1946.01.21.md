[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 19th Dispatch] According to Changchun reports, the Northeast reception work has proceeded smoothly since the reception of Changchun Municipal Government on December 22 last year.

After the cities in Huaihe River North were killed in battle, factories stopped work, the source of materials was insufficient, and the amount of coal was insufficient, and prices rose daily. The general people's lives were under considerable threat. Although the exchange rate between the circulation coupon and the legal tender was set at one to thirteen, very few people exchanged it. One is that there is still no legal tender here, and the other is that the fixed value is too high. The general public believes that if the National Army is stationed in the Northeast, it will be able to adjust the Qing Dynasty and the price can be expected to fall back.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] In the midst of some unbearable reports of the Communist army defying orders, betraying faith, blocking roads, destroying mines, attacking cities, and seizing land, the National Army was still able to achieve its major troop reduction plan by training methods in an extremely difficult time in accordance with the established policy.

### Major Robbery Case in Hong Kong

[United Press, Hong Kong, 19th Dispatch] The wife of a businessman in Hong Kong was robbed of US$200,000 in money orders yesterday. According to the person concerned, three Chinese people entered his apartment, one holding a pistol and two holding sharp knives, and tied himself and a ten-year-old boy to the bed. They searched the entire room in thirty minutes, and left. Afterwards, the maid returned and released the two. This is a horrific robbery case in Hong Kong after the war. The police station is making every effort to investigate today, but there are no clues.

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 19th Dispatch] Zhang Yuanshen, deputy director of the Oil Pipeline Engineering Office, said: The office will be closed soon. There are about 1,908 current employees, and half of them will be laid off or transferred separately. The issue of oil pipeline transfer has not yet been decided. It is estimated that there may be three ways: A, transfer to local government, B, transfer to the Highway Bureau, C, transfer to the Yunnan Provincial Garrison General Headquarters. What kind of method to adopt can be decided recently. The commercial value of the Sino-Indian oil pipeline is very low, because the consumption is too large and the management is difficult. The oil pipeline in China is 1,000 kilometers long. From the beginning to the present, the engineering responsibilities, material costs, general affairs fees, and employee salaries paid by our country have cost a total of 100 million yuan. As for the cost used by the U.S. government on the entire oil pipeline, if converted into legal currency at the black market price in U.S. dollars, it may be as high as 8,000 million yuan. In terms of the amount of oil transported, from the beginning of April to the end of October last year, the average monthly oil transportation was 70,000 barrels. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the U.S. military unconditionally transferred all oil pipelines in the country to our country free of charge in early November last year. This spirit of cooperation is deeply admired.

After the 16th of this month, the Communist Army continued to organize railway destruction teams to carry out destructive activities on the northern sections of the Pinghan and Tianjin-Pukou Railways, using various methods to entice Japanese engineers and coerce villagers along the railway lines to participate in road destruction and wire theft. The Communist forces near Xuzhou and south of Lincheng attempted to launch a sneak attack on Xuzhou after the ceasefire order was announced, but were repelled by local defense teams. The section east of Haizhou has been encroached upon by Communist forces who have violated the ceasefire agreement, disrupting traffic between Xuzhou and Haizhou.

North China Expedites Restoration of Telecommunications

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] The North China telecommunications network, which has been paralyzed for months, is expected to be fully restored to normal within a month if the ceasefire order is thoroughly implemented. According to the Beiping-Tianjin Telecommunications Administration, restoration work is actively underway. The government has prepared over 40 tons of copper wire, which is being transported from Jinghan to North China.  The local authorities also plan to dismantle less essential electrical wires between Beiping and Tianjin and relocate them to areas where rapid telecommunications restoration is necessary. Furthermore, the Dagu Factory has been ordered to draw copper wire to meet the large demand. There are also no major problems with telecommunications personnel. If manpower and resources are fully available and unhindered, North China's telecommunications can be fully restored within a month. The concern is that the ceasefire and traffic restoration orders may not be effectively implemented. Even after the ceasefire order took effect on the 14th, incidents of telecommunications destruction continued to occur. For example, on the 14th, 30 telegraph poles were destroyed between Dingxian and Zhaixidian on the Pinghan Railway. On the 17th, 8 telegraph poles were destroyed between Songlindian and Zhuozhou. On the same day, 100 poles were destroyed between Caohe and Baoding. There was also one instance of destruction on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway near Cangxian. Between Tangshan and Qinhuangdao on the Beining Railway, telecommunications were also destroyed once on the 13th, after the order was issued. The current status of various telecommunications trunk lines is as follows: (1) The Pinghan line can normally reach Shijiazhuang, but there is frequent severe destruction between Dingxian and Shijiazhuang, so telecommunications are only clear to Dingxian. The electrical wires between Shijiazhuang and Gaoqian south to Zhangde have been completely destroyed. If repairs are carried out simultaneously from both the north and south ends, it will take about a month. (2) Tianjin-Pukou line telecommunications can reach Cangxian in ten days, but there is occasional destruction. Between Botou and Yucheng in northern Shandong, and between Tai'an and Xuzhou, telecommunications have been completely destroyed. The remaining sections between Cangxian and Botou, and Cangxian to Jinan and Tai'an, are also currently not open. (3) The section between Tangshan and Qinhuangdao on the Beining line is subject to occasional destruction, but the rest is clear and can reach Jinzhou and Suizhong. (4) The Ping-Sui line telecommunications reach Qingliqiao. The authorities are currently preparing personnel and materials to repair this line's telecommunications. (5) The Pinggu line originally only reached Tongxian, but recently people were dispatched to repair it with guns, and it has been repaired to Shunyi. It will reach Miyun on the 21st.

### Syria and Lebanon Request Withdrawal of British and French Troops, Issue Appeal to the World, This Issue is Similar in Nature to the Iran-Soviet Dispute, United Nations Committees to Begin Work This Week

[United Press, London, 19th] During the inaugural session of the United Nations, Syria and Lebanon raised another urgent international political issue, appealing to the world today to demand the withdrawal of British and French troops from the Levant. This issue is similar in nature to the current Iran-Soviet dispute, where Soviet troops occupied northern Iran and will remain there until an agreement is reached on a withdrawal date. Syria and Lebanon do not intend to request formal action from the United Nations to resolve their issue, but merely want to draw the organization's attention to the fact that foreign troops remain in the Levant, hoping that public opinion will exert pressure to force the withdrawal of British and French troops. Syria and Lebanon were formerly French mandates and became areas of political dispute during the war. Although they have been recognized as sovereign independent states, France recognizes that the final link cannot be severed until the old League of Nations mandate system has been formally abolished. Syria and Lebanon have expressed serious opposition to Britain and France forming agreements on stationing troops in the area without their consent. The United Nations General Assembly has concluded a week-long debate, with representatives giving speeches 41 times. Only ten countries did not speak, including the Ukrainian representative who cancelled his speech due to illness. The other countries that did not speak were seven small Latin American countries, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Liberia, and the Philippines. After the debate, the General Assembly will proceed with the work of various committees to address urgent issues such as atomic energy, international relief, refugees, and the completion of the United Nations organization.

[Reuters, London, 20th] After yesterday's general debate, the focus for the first half of this week will be on the various committees. Some preliminary discussions on the control of atomic energy, originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon by the Political Committee, were postponed due to the illness of the committee's chairman, Ukrainian chief representative Manuilsky. The Administrative Committee appointed a subcommittee yesterday afternoon to study the annual salary and location of the United Nations Secretary-General. This subcommittee is composed of ten countries, including China and Egypt. The Security Council will convene the first closed meeting within the United Nations on Wednesday to discuss the selection of the Secretary-General. The Security Council will also issue an order to convene the Military Staff Committee, whose main task will be to determine the number of land, sea, and air forces that the fifty-one member states should provide to organize an international security force. The Economic and Social Council is also scheduled to hold its first meeting on Wednesday.

### Soviet Chief Representative Arrives Late, Vyshinsky Still in Moscow, Expresses Concern About Soviet Complaint to Iran

[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 20th: The United Nations has now begun to handle practical work. The absence of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Minister Vyshinsky makes the General Assembly feel somewhat uneasy. In the past week, London has expected Vyshinsky's arrival almost daily, and there was still news today that he might come here. It was not until the last moment that reliable sources learned that he was still in Moscow. The late arrival of the Soviet chief representative and Moscow's silence prevent London observers from making the explanation of delays due to bad weather.

[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 20th: The Soviet Union has expressed great concern about Iran's decision to submit the Azerbaijan dispute to the Security Council. The issue of the veto power of the five permanent members of the United Nations once brought the San Francisco Conference to a standstill, and the Iran-Soviet incident is bound to raise this issue again. However, one thing is certain: the Soviet representative in the Security Council cannot veto the investigation or discussion of the dispute. If the other members of the Security Council decide to seek a solution to the dispute through negotiation, inquiry, arbitration, or other peaceful means, the Soviet Union, as a party to the dispute, will not have the right to vote, and therefore cannot veto it. However, if the Security Council decides that economic or military action must be taken and that its decision must be implemented, the issue of the veto power will arise at this critical juncture. At this time, any permanent member can veto such action, because the United Nations Charter stipulates that the passage of a resolution requires the vote of all permanent members. It seems that the Soviet Union also has the right to veto whether the articles of the Charter can be applied to Iran's representative attending the Security Council and participating in the meeting without voting. The Economic and Social Council meeting will open on Wednesday, and India is also a member of the Council. It is expected that the Indian representative Mudaliar will be elected as Chairman. The Trusteeship Council will meet at the beginning of the week, but the Trusteeship Council will not actually convene until the first meeting of the General Assembly in April. According to the articles it has formulated, the Trusteeship Council may not convene until the areas to be placed under trusteeship are ready for delivery. British Prime Minister Attlee will be able to make a more detailed statement on trusteeship policy after the reconvening of Parliament on the weekend.

[Reuters, London, 20th] The Iranian delegation attending a United Nations body yesterday began taking formal steps to submit the Azerbaijan incident to the Security Council for handling. Iranian Chief Representative Takizadeh wrote to United Nations Executive Secretary Jambor, stating that the Iranian delegation, after proper study, decided to request the United Nations Secretary-General to submit the dispute between the two countries caused by Soviet interference in Iran's internal affairs to the Security Council for investigation and to propose appropriate solutions, in accordance with Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the United Nations Charter. Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the Charter stipulates: "Any member of the United Nations may bring any dispute or fact conforming to the provisions of Article 34 of this Charter to the attention of the Security Council or the General Assembly." Article 34 of the Charter states that "The Security Council may investigate any situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute, in order to determine whether the continuation of such dispute is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security." This move by the Iranian delegation has caused general surprise. Although Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi told the Iranian Parliament a week ago that he had instructed the Iranian delegation in London to take this step, it was generally believed that Iranian Chief Representative Takizadeh would wait until Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky arrived in London before submitting the matter to the Security Council. London observers generally believe that the Iranian incident is a test of the United Nations.

English Translation:
Afterward, General McNarney, commander of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany, issued a statement saying that according to the agreement reached in Yalta with the Soviet Union, a large number of Soviet citizens would be repatriated from Germany to the Soviet Union. This action sometimes required the use of force, and occasionally some, out of fear and nervousness, destroyed themselves. Therefore, it must be pointed out that among the few Soviet people remaining in Germany, there is a high possibility of including traitors, either deserters, those captured wearing German uniforms, or those who voluntarily defected to the enemies of the Soviet Union.

熊澤確係舊皇裔　但不致另立新皇致遺紛擾
English Translation:
Kumazawa is Indeed a Descendant of the Former Imperial Family, but a New Emperor Will Not Be Established to Avoid Disturbances

English Translation:
[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Special Dispatch]

記者單獨獲悉麥克阿瑟元帥部官員調查熊澤所提之要求後，現已滿意發現此困居於日本南部城市之熊澤老者，實爲日本皇室之嫡出。
English Translation:
This reporter learned exclusively that after officials of General MacArthur's headquarters investigated the claims made by Kumazawa, they are now satisfied that the elderly Kumazawa, who is confined to a city in southern Japan, is indeed a direct descendant of the Japanese imperial family.

裕仁乃爲北朝墓信者之後
English Translation:
Emperor Hirohito is a descendant of the adherents of the Northern Court

，保皇派人最近雖發表聲明，謂熊澤所提之要求「荒唐無稽」然盟軍總部當局與日本歷史專家進行研討後，已判斷態澤之要求正確，麥帥總部雖判斷態澤之要求理屬正當，然總部不致再採取其他行動，蓋日本政局複雜，另立新皇，自將引起不需要之混亂。
English Translation:
Although royalists recently issued a statement saying that Kumazawa's claims were "absurd," Allied Headquarters authorities, after conducting research with Japanese history experts, have judged the claims to be correct. Although MacArthur's headquarters judged Kumazawa's claims to be justified, the headquarters will not take any further action, because the Japanese political situation is complex, and establishing a new emperor will cause unnecessary confusion.

English Translation:
The sound waves it emits are heard by personnel at three widely spaced acoustic detection stations on shore using electroacoustic detectors, and then, by comparing the time with a specially prepared table, the location of the bomb's explosion can be found.

此項測聲站可望於本年夏在西海岸及夏威夷之聞裝設完成。
English Translation:
These acoustic detection stations are expected to be installed on the West Coast and Hawaii by this summer.
