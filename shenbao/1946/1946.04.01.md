### China Has Immense Recuperative Power and Can Become a Strong Eastern Nation; U.S. Officials Hold Emergency Discussions on Economic Aid to China

"United Press, Washington, 30th" According to a high-ranking official: U.S. economic assistance to China is absolutely necessary and must be completed. Research into methods for China's recovery, roughly related to finance, is currently undergoing lengthy emergency consultations here. When asked if lending to China was worth the risk, the official replied firmly: "The answer is quite simple. We really have no choice but to assist China." The official, who has a background and experience in China, and is now closely involved in Sino-U.S. affairs, stated that if China falls into prolonged economic chaos and political division, the U.S.'s war objectives in the Pacific would be half-lost. If China cannot become a strong, democratic nation, the Pacific will fall into indescribable chaos. Establishing a transportation system to revive China is absolutely necessary. China's problem is our problem and it is the greatest problem we face in the world today. China has immense recuperative power. One thing that is gratifying is that one can see cheerful, intelligent faces in China. Although the Chinese people have endured hardship, their spirit has not been broken. They are truly a superior people. China must have the strength to become a dominant power in the Pacific, replacing Japan. The United States has proven to the Chinese that its current extensive activities in China have no hidden motives. When asked if there were any signs that Japan's propaganda of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere had taken root in China, the official replied no, because the Japanese are hated everywhere and can be said to have achieved their goal. He also said that traveling in China today is extremely difficult, so restoring the operation of China's arteries is urgently needed. The first step is to restore navigation on the Yangtze River. At present, navigation is not smooth due to a lack of trained sailors to operate internal combustion engine powered riverboats.

### Four Major Events in Europe Yesterday: Greek Elections Proceed Smoothly; New Cabinets Formed in Belgium and Bulgaria; Dozens Arrested in Nazi Remnant Uprising in Germany

[Our Dispatch] London, 31st Broadcast: Four important events occurred in Europe today. First, in Greece, the country's first election in ten years was held today and proceeded very smoothly, with enthusiastic voters. Second, Belgium formed a new cabinet today, with a strong left-wing flavor. Six of the new cabinet members are from the Liberal Party, five are from the Communist Party, and three are independents. Third, a new cabinet was formed in Bulgaria, with participation from all parties, including two members of the opposition who demanded new elections and opposed the Communist Party joining the government. Fourth, in Frankfurt, western Germany, remnants of the Nazi "Werewolf" organization carried out a large-scale party uprising, and dozens of people were arrested, including a former leader of the Hitler Youth.

[United Press, Athens, 30th] The Greek election is one of the most important elections in post-war Europe. Greece is the last stronghold of British influence in the Balkans and the only country in the Balkans not absolutely controlled by left-wing forces. Experienced political observers here believe that the election results will favor the right-wing party, or be a preliminary step towards the restoration of King George.

[United Press, Athens, 30th] The streets here are full of armed army and navy soldiers, and British troops are also standing by. Hundreds of American, British, and French observers will monitor the election, but the Soviet Union has refused to participate.

News of the Soviet withdrawal from northern Iran continues to reach Tehran. When withdrawing, the Soviet troops hand over security responsibilities to the local gendarmerie, as Iranian troops have not yet advanced north to take over the areas vacated by the Soviet troops. Well-informed Iranian and British circles believe that although there is no written agreement between the Soviet Union and Iran, the two governments may have some kind of "understanding," namely that if the Iranian central government does not send troops to garrison the area, allowing the local autonomous government to maintain its power, then the Soviet troops may even withdraw from Azerbaijan.

### Bevin Calls on the Powers to Abandon Imperialism; Do Not Use Military Force to Resolve Disputes Under Any Circumstances

[United Press, Bristol, 30th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, speaking to the Transport and General Workers' Union tonight, called on the world's powers to abandon the method of negotiating through threats, and proposed that the United Nations establish a proper mechanism to resolve economic competition, but did not mention the dispute between the Soviet Union and Iran. Bevin said that it is inappropriate for large countries to occupy the territory of small countries by force, forcing them to negotiate or thereby obtaining concessions. The use of force is the imperialism of the nineteenth century. Member states of the United Nations should conclude an agreement that, under no circumstances, should military force be used to resolve disputes. Imperialism must be abandoned, and the belief is that a solution can be found, and to accept a principle that representatives of major countries are unwilling to use military force. The method of negotiating through threats must be abandoned, and there is even more to this, such as if important raw material relationships cause conflicts between major countries, there should be a suitable mechanism to deal with them, instead of adopting the old method of resolving with military force.

### Tentative Proposals for Implementing a New Land Policy (Part 2)

— Tao Qiwu

Victory came too suddenly, and all restoration preparation work seemed rushed and unable to keep up with the pace of time. The situation after the victory, the political and military developments in various localities, were also beyond my prior predictions. Of course, in terms of seizing the time, we should, on the one hand, take over, and on the other hand, immediately issue emergency decrees based on the Kuomintang's land policy, adjust the distribution of land and people, and implement land revolution. However, in reality, the situation across the country varies greatly. To solve the current problems, we cannot ignore reality and must adapt to local conditions, formulating methods that can be smoothly implemented under a single policy (from "land to the tiller" to "land nationalization") for different regions with varying conditions. In the author's opinion, the implementation of land reform nationwide should be divided into three major regions, and the methods adopted in these three major regions do not necessarily have to be the same. The major divisions of these regions are as follows:

(A) Reclaimed areas originally under enemy and puppet control;

(B) The Free Area of the Great Rear;

(C) Special areas (including areas where conflicts have ceased—using the name "Political Consultative Conference"—as well as what the Communist Party calls guerrilla areas, and former enemy-occupied regime areas).

(A) The first type of area mentioned above is reclaimed from enemy and puppet control. These areas are all along the river and coast, with convenient transportation, dense population, and fragmented land rights. The period of fall in these areas varies. Some are war zones with intertwined fronts, resulting in population displacement, loss of land records, and large areas becoming wasteland. In some areas, the fall lasted for a long time, and the enemy and puppets established a new order that lasted for several years, during which land rights were transferred repeatedly. The relationship between owners and land falls into the following four categories: (1) those with deeds and boundaries; (2) those with deeds but no boundaries; (3) those with no deeds but boundaries; and (4) those with no deeds and no boundaries.

When the local government is established in the recovered areas, the land administration authorities should, together with fair and upright local gentry (who did not collaborate with the enemy), immediately establish a Land Rights Evaluation Committee to re-evaluate all land ownership in the county. All owners should apply to the committee for registration and review within the prescribed public notice period. Upon receiving the application, the committee should handle it separately according to the following standards:

(1) For owners with deeds and boundaries, if it is verified that the deed was issued by a legitimate local authority before the fall, or has been registered, their ownership should be recognized. If their land has been forcibly occupied, the committee should immediately rule to return it to the original owner. If the deed is issued or approved by the puppet government, they should be required to provide local legitimate persons or shopkeepers to prove that their acquisition of ownership went through legal procedures and did not involve plunder, and it should also be recognized. (2), (3) For those with deeds but no boundaries and those with boundaries but no deeds, the original owners should be required to provide boundary and deed certificates or ancestral guarantees. After examination and public announcement procedures, if there is no doubt, their ownership can also be confirmed. If it has been illegally occupied, it should also be ordered to be returned.

After the above land is returned to the original owner, or the original owner's ownership is confirmed, the exercise of their ownership should be subject to the following restrictions: (1) No arbitrary increase in tenant rent is allowed. (2) No arbitrary eviction of tenants is allowed. (3) The acreage of fields is not allowed to exceed a certain limit, and the excess part will be confiscated by the Land Rights Evaluation Committee. (4) For land returned or confirmed to the original owner according to the above standards, if it is excessively fragmented or scattered, making it inconvenient for cultivation, the evaluation committee should order the owners to consult and concentrate it into a single piece through exchange and division methods to facilitate cultivation. However, if the land has different fertility, the party benefiting more from the exchange and division should compensate the party suffering losses based on the current value. (5) If tenants or hired farmers owe debts to the landlord during the fall period, the evaluation committee should rule to reasonably reduce or exempt them.

(4) As for the fourth type of land with no boundaries and no deeds, as well as land that does not meet the provisions of items (1), (2), and (3) to determine the owner's ownership, confiscated excess land, abandoned land in war zones, and land confiscated from the enemy and puppets, should all be taken over by the evaluation committee. Taking the township as a unit, it should be distributed to the following personnel for cultivation according to the method of allotting land based on population. The priority order is as follows: 1. Returning refugees from the township. 2. Retired soldiers. 3. Public and educational personnel registered in the township. (Even if public and educational personnel are working elsewhere, their families should have the right to allocation, so that farming and education can be integrated, and the lives of public and educational personnel are not easy to improve for a while. Allocating land for their families to cultivate can support integrity and help reduce corruption in governance). Allotting land based on population should be mainly self-cultivation, and it should be stipulated that they have lifelong use rights, so as to truly achieve "land to the tiller."

(B) The Free Area of the Great Rear. During the eight years of bitter war, the Great Rear provided adequate military and civilian food supplies, which cannot but be attributed to the hard work of most farmers. During the war of resistance, food prices followed commodity prices, rising step by step, allowing landlords to gain profits without labor, increasing their income. In reality, the surplus grain of the tenants and hired farmers who actually cultivate the land is often not enough for one year's consumption. Whenever there is a shortage of grain, they resort to high-interest loans to survive, and when the new grain is harvested, they use it to pay off debts at low prices, so their lives are never easy to improve. On the landlord side, since the war of resistance, although they have made every effort to contribute through requisitions and purchases, they have also made great contributions to the country. However, due to the circumstances, they have reaped huge profits, making wealth more concentrated, and the distribution of social wealth is even more uneven, which the government cannot ignore. The method of adjustment should follow the legislative principles of the Land Law, and implement the following measures effectively with moderate means:

(1) Increase the land value tax, so that land prices fall, giving individual farmers the opportunity to buy land.

(2) Implement a 25% rent reduction, so that the landlord's income does not exceed 37.5% of the total income from the cultivated land's main produce. If this can be strictly implemented, land prices are expected to fall, giving tenants the opportunity to purchase land.

(3) Implement a land limit system, so that the number of fields owned by each household does not exceed a certain limit. Collect high progressive taxes on the excess to prevent excessive concentration of land. If the landlord sells the field, the tenant has the right to purchase it at a preferential price.

(4) Protect the tenancy rights and perpetual tenancy rights of tenants, so that landlords cannot evict tenants at will. Only when tenants have definite guarantees can they do their best to improve their land.

(5) In most parts of the Great Rear, except for central and southeastern Sichuan, cultivation has been carried out everywhere, and the land can be said to have been utilized to a considerable extent. However, in provinces such as Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, there are barren mountains and wastelands everywhere. The government should allocate retired officers and soldiers, public and educational personnel and their families to settle and cultivate, or recruit reclamation personnel to invest in agriculture. After reclamation is completed, the reclamation personnel should be given considerable benefits, and then gradually repay their investment.

(6) Confiscate the land of absentee landlords and allocate it to retired officers and soldiers, public and educational personnel, or their families to cultivate. The above reclaimed areas and free areas of the Great Rear all recognize private land ownership to a considerable extent, but with moderate restrictions. If implemented in this way, the income of landlords who gain without cultivation will gradually decrease, and they will have to gradually sell their land to invest in industry and commerce? Large landlords will be automatically eliminated, and at the same time, those with the ability to cultivate can have the opportunity to acquire land, without the need to achieve the goal through violence. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching of "land to the tiller" can be fully achieved.

(C) Special areas. Part of the land in the special zone has already been reallocated, and part is in newly expanded areas after Japan's surrender, and the distribution relationship seems to be in transition. Whether to recognize its current system or to readjust it with regard to land disposal in this area depends on the outcome of the "consultation" before a decision can be made. However, what is adopted in this area seems to be purely a system of land nationalization. All land of bureaucrats, warlords, local bullies, landlords, ancestral halls, temples, association properties, and rich peasants has been confiscated and reallocated to hired farmers, poor peasants, middle peasants, workers, soldiers, or their families. The theory of land public ownership was originally recognized by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and general scholars, but the means adopted by each other are different. In fact, the boundaries of the fields in these areas have been completely destroyed, and the original landlords may no longer exist. Most of the land has adopted collective management methods, and restoring the original state is impossible and unnecessary. It is best to think of ways from a positive perspective. In this type of area, we should actively develop farmland water conservancy, promote scientific management, such as improving soil to prevent disasters, and expanding the use of land machinery, so that cultivation efficiency reaches the highest level, so that the least amount of manpower can harvest the greatest output. As a result, everyone can recognize that the efficiency and harvest of public, state-owned, and collectively operated businesses are indeed better than self-cultivation on a small area of individual land. If this trend is created and farmers gain universal belief, then without forcible supervision, everyone will automatically move in this direction.

The above three types of regions adopt different methods, but they all lead to the same goal (land to the tiller—land nationalization), and the ultimate goal is still the same.

Land is necessary for human life. Our food, clothing, housing, and transportation all come directly or indirectly from the land. If the land problem is solved properly, the source of food and clothing for the people will be inexhaustible, and then we can talk about industrial construction, promote social progress, and economic prosperity. If the solution is improper and the land cannot be used effectively and distributed reasonably, the result of monopolizing land benefits and wasting local resources will inevitably lead to social injustice and hinder the progress of economic life. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "The primary task of nation-building is people's livelihood." The implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood must take equal land rights as a prerequisite. If the land is used to its fullest potential, the vast rural areas can be stabilized, agricultural production can be increased, and industrial raw materials will not be lacking. If the living standards of farmers are improved and their purchasing power is increased, there will be a broad market for industrial products to digest. And the stability and prosperity of rural order and security are undoubtedly a prerequisite for the widespread development of industrial construction. Therefore, equal land rights and industrial construction must advance simultaneously and complement each other. The great cause of nation-building can then be successful. If we are biased towards one side, the result will inevitably be nothing. Now that the war has been won and domestic political consultation has succeeded, we hope that the government will seize the opportunity, while planning the entire industrial construction, make a bold decision in a timely manner based on the Principle of People's Livelihood land policy and the successive resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session and the Second Plenary Session, and solve the land problem. (The End)

### Great Difficulties in Import and Export Trade, Many Reasons, Difficult to Make Profits, Most Merchants Maintain a Wait-and-See Attitude, Foreign Goods Arrive Slowly, Unbearable Interest Burden, Most Raw Silk Exports Suffer Losses, Ninety Percent of Pig Bristles Are Returned

[Our newspaper news] This reporter recently visited a giant in the import and export industry in this city, asking about the general situation of the import and export industry in this city. I was told: It has not been long since our country opened up foreign exchange; the import and export industry has just resumed, and there is a sense of unfamiliarity and difficulty in all aspects. Difficulties on the import side include: (1) The designated banks fail to provide as much foreign exchange as needed by importers and exporters. (2) The schedules of ships sailing from foreign countries to China are often uncertain. (3) Industrial and other necessities are also in short supply in foreign countries, so an order often takes four or five months, and there is no definite news of arrival in Shanghai. For this reason, importers in this city have a wait-and-see attitude towards import trade. It is understood that the implicit interest rate in the wood market is very high. When ordering goods from abroad, the full amount of the goods must be paid. Now, if the goods cannot arrive in port for four or five months, whether it is still profitable to bear the huge interest burden even if the goods arrive in the future is quite doubtful. There are also difficulties on the export side: (1) The quality of local products has gradually declined after the war, and it does not meet the standards required by foreign countries. (2) The transportation situation in various places has not yet recovered, and it is quite difficult to transport local products to Shanghai. It is said that among the recent exports, raw silk and pig bristles account for the majority. The former often suffers losses after export. The latter is mostly returned because the quality does not meet the standards. Therefore, it is hoped that in the future, export products should be inspected and qualified by our Commodity Inspection Bureau before being exported. At the same time, it is also hoped that we can negotiate with American merchants to use the inspection results of our Commodity Inspection Bureau as the standard for export products, so as to avoid disputes over inspection standards.

Import and Export Companies Establish Guild

[Our newspaper news] The Shanghai Import and Export Companies Guild, after two months of preparation, held its inaugural meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday on the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association.

First, he reported on the preparation process of the association, and said that the number of registered members had reached more than 300. Subsequently, Zhou Lianze, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, Chen Su, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Ge Jechen, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others delivered speeches respectively. Finally, the articles of association and many proposals were discussed, and fifteen directors, seven supervisors, five alternate directors, and two alternate supervisors were elected.

The plane was personally piloted by Captain Yu of a certain squadron of our Air Force and is expected to arrive in Tokyo in eight hours.

### Tax Bureau to Hold Registration of Customs Brokers

Merchants in this city mostly entrust customs brokers to handle procedures with the Goods Tax Bureau to declare and transport unified tax goods and apply for the necessary documents and permits. However, some customs brokers have not handled matters satisfactorily, and even delay forwarding the documents and permits they have obtained. When the consignors urge for transportation, they arbitrarily shirk their responsibilities. It is learned that the Tax Bureau, in view of this, has ordered strict prevention and will hold registration of customs brokers to rectify the situation.

### Add Trains to Wuxi for Easy Tomb Sweeping

In view of the approaching Qingming Festival, the Two-Roads Administration has added a third-class passenger train from Shanghai to Wuxi at 9:20 a.m. every day starting yesterday to facilitate passengers returning home to sweep tombs. The train stops at Nanxiang, Huangdu, Anting, Kunshan, Weiting, Suzhou, Wangting, and can arrive in Wuxi at 12:28 p.m. on the same day.

In addition, the bureau has recently reported that unscrupulous people often purchase passenger tickets from the bureau and resell them at higher prices outside. This is abhorrent. In addition to strict investigation and prohibition, the bureau hereby announces to passengers that they must purchase tickets at the ticket window in accordance with the bureau's regulations to avoid losses.

### Labor Dispute in Bath Industry Resumes Mediation

Yesterday, they were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### A Major Theft Case Cracked, Twelve Boxes of Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Worth 50 Million Yuan

[Our newspaper news] The Ministry of Military Administration's Military Administration Department received the First Army Hospital of the Japanese Army in Jiangwan last year, which stored a large number of valuable Western medicines produced by the German Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory. Unexpectedly, they were repeatedly stolen, resulting in huge losses. Later, the department sent personnel to guard it day and night, but thefts still occurred. He Chenggeng, a military medical supervisor, and Wang Shulin, an adjutant of the Shanghai Health General Warehouse of the Ministry of Military Administration, found out that they had colluded with police officers from the Changshu Police Bureau to go to the residence of Wang Kechang, an employee at No. 27 Dumei New Village, Pushi Road, and seized twelve boxes of Bayer pharmaceuticals on the spot, worth more than 50 million yuan. At that time, Wang was out and had not returned. The police bureau and others continued to arrest two accomplices elsewhere and took them to the bureau for interrogation.

### Shi Konghuai Discusses the Problem of Building a Bridge over the Huangpu River

[Our newspaper news] Mao Yisheng, a Chinese bridge expert, expressed his views on the bridge over the Huangpu River that is being planned for construction in this city, saying that if a high bridge is built on the Bund of Zhongzheng Road, the bridgehead must start in front of the Great World..., If a tunnel is built, the Shanghai beach is too deep, and the stone is only encountered more than 900 feet below the water surface, which is the same difficulty as building a high bridge. Mao's conclusion is that only a movable flat bridge can be built temporarily, and the middle part of the bridge can be opened at a specified time for ships to pass through. It is said that direct transportation between the two sides of the Huangpu River is extremely important for the development of Shanghai's commercial port and the development of the Pudong area, and all parties are paying close attention to this issue. Yesterday, this reporter met with Shi Konghuai, a Chinese port expert. According to Shi, "There were originally many ferries on both sides of the Huangpu River south of the Bund of Zhongzheng Road, but it is still felt that they cannot pass at any time, and there are some obstacles to navigation. Now Shanghai is not only the largest commercial port in our country, but also one of the world's major ports. Its future development is unlimited. Anything that hinders navigation should be avoided as much as possible, so building a flat bridge on the Bund of Zhongzheng Road should be carefully considered. As for the tunnel, it does not have to be built on the stone. For example, the New York Holland Tunnel, which passes through the Hudson River, is built in the mud and sand at the bottom of the river. The deepest point of the tunnel averages about 101.5 feet from the high water surface to the bottom of the tunnel, so there is no need to be as deep as more than 900 feet below the water surface. Although the construction cost of the tunnel is more expensive than that of the high bridge, its convenience for land and water transportation is far superior to that of the high bridge, especially in national defense, it has a more secure value. I hope it will be available for the authorities to study."

### Shout on Tangshan Road, Apprentice Killed by Bullet

[Our newspaper news] Near Baoding Road on Tangshan Road in Pudong last night at 7:30, two drunk American sailors stumbled into the road and forcibly dragged a pedestrian, who was terrified and called for help. A member of a certain regimental headquarters rushed to the scene after hearing the sound. Suddenly, a gunshot rang out, and a stray bullet injured the bladder of Chai Zhongfa, an apprentice at Yisheng Silk Factory (Chai is 19 years old and lives at No. 52, Lane 952, Tangshan Road). He fell to the ground in response and died shortly after due to the injury to the vital part. As for the two sailors who were drunk, they had fled without a trace. The division in charge, the division bureau, was still thoroughly investigating the shooter late last night.

### Drive Robbery Gold

Our newspaper news) Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock, an old goods shop with great interest (also dealing in gold and silver buying and selling) at 316 Xiafei Road suddenly came to a customer, claiming that he wanted to buy a gold bar.

Unexpectedly, when he was walking in the Song Village Lane at 312 on the same road, the customer suddenly took out a pistol to threaten him and fled with the gold. The victim reported to the Taishan Branch for investigation. The fugitive was wearing a green robe and suit pants, and was about twenty years old.

It is rumored that more than 400 important and secondary traitors who have been arrested one after another have been transferred to the court and will be publicly tried.

### Health Authorities: Not Afraid of More Garbage, Good Use of Waste

— Reported by our correspondent, Canglong

Do you hate garbage? But Shanghai has a lot of it! If you don't believe it, Mayor Qian's report at the Municipal Council the other day will astound you. He said that when the municipal government first took over, there were more than 10,000 tons of garbage in the streets of the city. Under the supervision of the relevant authorities, a total of 382,661 tons of garbage have been cleared in the past six months!

Where does so much garbage come from, and who collects it? And how is it disposed of? Urban children living in their ivory towers may not pay attention to these "trivial matters." But the Health Bureau has established a Cleaning Brigade specifically for clearing garbage. The brigade is divided into eight squadrons, each responsible for the work of one police district.

According to statistics, the city's daily garbage production is between 1,600 and 3,000 tons. During Christmas and New Year's holidays, the amount of garbage produced is even more frightening. What to do? Only urge street sweepers and garbage collectors to work harder. There are now more than 3,000 street sweepers working every day, which is one-third more than before the victory. These urban garbage removers have to go to each workstation at 6:30 every morning to report (meaning roll call). By 7:30, they have all arrived at their work destinations and started their cleaning tasks. From 11:30 to 1:30, it is their lunch time. After that, they have to work until 4:30 or 5:00 before stopping. Every day, each street sweeper is responsible for sweeping garbage within one kilometer, and each garbage collector is responsible for collecting, transporting, and disposing of thirty large and small garbage cans.

However, many people still dump garbage on the streets. The Health Bureau has decided that before May 1 this year, every household in the city must prepare a container for garbage. Every day at a certain time, a garbage truck specially dispatched by the Health Bureau will come to collect it, ringing a bell.

Currently, there are three ways to dispose of garbage: land reclamation, landfill, and incineration. Most of the garbage is transported by garbage boats to vacant land near Sanlintang in Pudong for temporary storage. The Health Bureau believes that these disposal methods are outdated, so they have planned a thorough and fundamental cleaning method. They plan to divide the city's garbage into five categories: (1) animal waste such as meat bones and fish bones, (2) plant waste such as vegetable roots and bark, (3) cloth strips and paper scraps, (4) tin cans and waste cans, and (5) cinder and ash. After this analysis, most of the garbage can be turned into useful things. How to transform it?

There is quite a lot of second-category garbage. The plant waste collected from the city's twenty-seven vegetable markets every day is already considerable. The Health Bureau plans to concentrate this type of garbage in a disused public cemetery, let it corrode, and according to chemical principles, it can produce a large amount of CH4, which is combustible biogas. In this way, the combustion of biogas can be used to incinerate unnecessary garbage, and the combustion of biogas will also be used to generate steam. The third category of garbage, cloth strips and paper scraps, can be melted into pulp to make recycled paper. This is an exciting plan to produce materials from garbage, which you may not believe. However, the Health Bureau is actively promoting it and hopes to realize it within this year.

The preliminary plan is said to utilize the city's Baojia system for mutual assistance and cooperation. The Health Bureau will, on the one hand, try to place five types of garbage containers everywhere, supervise and urge specialists to classify the garbage first, and then provide different treatments.

Undeniably, Nanshi is still the place with the most accumulated garbage. The Health Bureau said that it is now determined to deal with it comprehensively, starting with the Yemiao district in Nanshi as the starting point for garbage removal. The elders and leaders of the district have now been convened to discuss ways to remove the garbage.

In such a large city, there are many restaurants, but there are only 217 public toilets in the city, which is far from the actual needs. It is now said that another 200 will be added, of which 88 are expected to be completed within the year, and ten urinals will also be added recently.

Do you hate garbage? Not entirely! Don't bury the garbage! There is nothing useless in the world; it depends on how people use it. However, if you are determined to produce a lot of garbage, remember to put it in your own garbage can. Even if you don't use it, it will still be used by the public. Useless garbage can be turned into useful materials again.

### Social Services

My aunt (my uncle has passed away) mortgaged the property to someone in the 20th year of the Republic of China, a shop, for 700 legal tender, using a receipt as a mortgage and rent as interest. When the term expired, it was during the War of Resistance, and it was not redeemed. If it is redeemed now, will it still be calculated in legal tender? According to the public announcement of the Central Economic Special Commissioner in October last year, pre-war deposits are all calculated in legal tender. Is the same procedure applicable to pre-war debts? If calculated according to the price index, how many times should it be increased? (2) My aunt borrowed 300 legal tender from someone in the 17th year of the Republic of China, using a house receipt as a mortgage. Later, interest was added to the principal, and another 100 yuan was borrowed, bringing the total to 600 yuan in the 26th year. Is it still calculated in legal tender now? (3) Can I handle the above questions on my behalf, or does my aunt still have to handle them on her own?

Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers: (1) Pre-war debts are handled in the same way as deposits. (Refer to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Proceedings after Reconstruction) (2) Repayment now is still calculated in legal tender. (3) The original debtor should handle the matter.

### Last Week's Gold and Foreign Exchange Market Weak, Securities Speculation Unusually Prosperous, Grain Market Prices Gradually Decline

The trends of various industries last week were relatively stable, but some hot money has not developed normally and is still active in speculative black market transactions. Initially, the rice market was tight due to rain, and merchants raised prices, with white japonica rice hovering around 32,000 yuan. Later, the weather cleared and arrivals increased sharply, causing a general decline. By the weekend, white japonica rice had fallen to 28,000 yuan. Cotton yarn prices rose due to strong demand from Guangdong merchants. The cloth market was soft, but poplin and printed cloth prices were firm due to seasonality. The details are as follows:

Gold Bullion: Due to the end of the month, those in urgent need of funds frequently sold, and the Bank of China's exchange rate remained unchanged, continuing the weakness. At the beginning of the week, it was around 1.6 million, and then it gradually fell. By Saturday afternoon, it had fallen below the 1.5 million mark to 1,495,000, and finally closed at 1.5 million yuan.

Unified Bonds: Rumors were rife, and hot money was rampant. Although the authorities were investigating and banning it, the black market was still rampant. The market price of unified bonds rose steadily. On Tuesday, a certain large short-seller dumped a large amount, causing a slight rebound. On Wednesday, buying interest at low prices was strong again, and it seemed to rise again. Type C bonds exceeded the 3,000 yuan mark. On Thursday, some short positions could not be delivered and were suspended, but scattered transactions were still pushing up the price. By Saturday, Type C bonds had risen sharply to 3,400, and the rest had rebounded slightly.

Foreign Exchange: The US exchange rate was 2,020 yuan, and there was no progress in US dollars, so it remained within 2,000 yuan. Hong Kong dollars gradually sold off after speculators made profits, falling once. Old goods fell from 435 yuan to 415 yuan, and new goods once approached the 200 yuan mark. On Saturday, it was slightly firmer, but still 20-30 yuan lower than the previous week.

Stocks: At the beginning of the week, Chinese stocks were slightly hesitant, and foreign stocks saw a surge in sellers, but the steel industry was particularly strong. On Wednesday, buying interest in Chinese stocks was strong, and the market price rose steadily, creating an unprecedented peak. Foreign stocks were also lifted by the rise in Chinese stocks. The next day, there was a dispute in the bond market, and it was also the eve of the holiday, so the industry generally took a wait-and-see attitude. Chinese stocks initially stabilized, but then fell back in the middle, but the three small stocks rose particularly high. Foreign stocks had different supply and demand, and rose and fell differently. At the weekend, some people were searching for large Chinese stocks, and the price rose again. Small stocks such as Xinguang fell slightly, and there were no other changes. Sentiment in foreign stocks was boosted, and they rose unanimously, with paper stocks rising even more.

Spun Yarn: In the past week, the initial trend was very mediocre. Later, the actual needs of the Guangdong merchants continued, especially on Saturday when purchases were the most smooth. And there was news of immediate shipment, so new buying and short covering were very enthusiastic, while new sellers were relatively scarce, forming a situation where demand exceeded supply. The highest transaction for the entire week was 2.85 million for 60-count Sunlight fine yarn on Saturday, an increase of 200,000 from the previous week. 20-count special Double Horse yarn rose by 90,000, followed by 10-count Boy Scout yarn, which rose by 110,000. The other yarns rose by 30-50,000.

Cloth Market: Due to the abundance of inventory on the market, there was little demand from merchants and stores, and textile mills could not start selling, so the market was lifeless. Among the various brands, Daming poplin rose the most, 4,000 yuan more than the previous week. Coarse cloth was stable, and fine yarn and Shilin cloth fell by 3-4,000 yuan.

Cotton Market: The source of foreign cotton was continuous, and manufacturers and cotton firms were increasingly waiting and watching. Purchases were not as strong as in the previous weeks, but at the weekend, the price of US cotton futures soared by more than 60 pounds, and the price of cotton in Shanghai also had a booming trend. As a result, the prices of various cottons rose by 3-5,000 compared to the previous week.

### West Sichuan Hongtong Oil on the Market

After eight years of the War of Resistance, West Sichuan Hongtong oil, which had disappeared from the market, has gradually resumed production this spring and has been successively transported to Shanghai. The sales of various brands, such as Xu Yongchang, Liu Tongqing, Liu Qingyuanfeng, Dachangfeng, Xiao Hengqing, etc., have all arrived in one or two batches, so the wholesale of each store has returned to the pre-war state. The selling price is between 84-85,000 yuan per barrel, while Hongjiang Tung oil, which is self-made in the Mudi and Suxi areas, has been naturally eliminated. Although the selling price is cheaper, at 60,000 yuan per barrel, it is difficult to compete in comparison. It is heard that Zhengpai Hongtong oil, such as Jichanghe and Jiyingfeng, are also preparing to resume production, and it is expected that they can be listed on the market in the spring this winter.

### Redemption of Counterfeit Currency, Ended as Scheduled Yesterday, Very Little Remained

The redemption of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes ended yesterday, and from today on, they will become waste paper. The four banks and two bureaus and some banks and Zhuang's counterfeit currency redemption departments all followed orders and continued to work on the holiday yesterday, until 5:00 pm. However, the number of people redeeming counterfeit currency yesterday was not as crowded as expected. According to Bank of China officials, the counterfeit currency redemption period lasted for five months from November 1 of last year to yesterday. Compared with the currently redeemed amount, there is little difference from the nominal issue amount of 41,993 billion yuan for counterfeit currency. The amount left over is obviously very small. As for the redemption work in various outer ports, Bank of China had previously telegraphed to report by telegram or letter yesterday. Bank of China will not accept overdue redemptions. However, the area where counterfeit currency is circulating is as wide as ten sparrows, and telegrams and letters take time, so the total number of redemptions will have to wait until three days later to be known.

### World Tea Famine, Americans Dissatisfied with Inferior Tea

[Reuters, London, March 31] At present, people in various countries around the world, especially in the United States, are quite dissatisfied with the abundance of inferior tea on the market. Although the needs of various countries have increased, the United Nations Food Agency has not greatly increased the allocation for the coming year. For countries that are not major food producers, the ration is only half of what they consumed before the war, but the supply to Britain and the United States has not decreased significantly. Unless Dutch East Indies and other liberated areas of the East can export 200 million pounds per year, it seems unlikely that tea rations and controls will be lifted. But to reach this figure, it will take at least two years after the situation in the Dutch East Indies has stabilized. It is estimated that one-third of the tea-producing areas in the Dutch East Indies have been destroyed or abandoned and are not suitable for planting.

### Method of Endorsing Negotiable Instruments, Abolished from Today

The old habits of receiving and paying negotiable instruments in the city's banking industry will be changed from today, and the principle of holding the bill (i.e., the person who holds the money) will be implemented. In order to comply with the principles of the Ministry of Orders and the four joint offices, the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association has stipulated that all existing checks that contain the name or title of the payee are registered, and those that do not contain the name or title of the payee are unregistered. Regardless of whether the words "bearer" or "holder" are crossed out, the holder of the bill is the person who holds the money. The practice of guaranteeing endorsements by collection agencies in the past is abolished at the same time.

### Under Attack from Both Internal and External Forces, the Production Industry Seeks Self-Salvation, City Chamber of Commerce Holds Meeting Today

(Reported by this newspaper) The City Chamber of Commerce will convene various industrial associations at Yushi this afternoon to discuss ways to cope with the current crisis in the industrial sector. Recently, foreign orders have increased, and the production of domestic products has fallen behind, while general import firms are still calling for and accepting orders. Labor unrest is also increasing day by day. With the sharp rise in the cost of living, factories cannot calculate production costs, and work stoppages are heard of every day. Investment in new factories is even regarded as a dangerous path. At the request of several important industrial associations, the City Chamber of Commerce is convening a meeting today to agree on ways to cope with the situation.

### Inventory Verification at the Enemy and Puppet Yarn and Cloth Clearing Office

It has been operating for almost a month. Among the staff, there are experienced personnel from the former puppet merchants' association. It is reported that a large portion of the goods that the Textile Construction Corporation is selling comes from this office. According to the results of the inventory check against the records, some of the goods are no longer very usable due to being stored for too long.

### Customs and Electric Factory to Auction Large Quantities of Materials

The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau entrusted the Jianghai Customs to start auctioning a large quantity of enemy and puppet materials starting today.

The quantity and value of the materials received have since doubled. The Enemy Property Bureau has already sold pigments worth 36 million yuan and pharmaceuticals worth 250 million yuan.

Timber production has always been scarce in the Jiangnan area. With the recovery period now, there is a great need for timber, so prices have risen sharply and it is difficult to purchase. This phenomenon is particularly serious in the Nanjing area. It is recently heard that merchants from Shayi have gathered a large amount of timber in Yichang, waiting for the river water to rise slightly before rafting it downstream to supply the market.

Special Production and Construction Edition

### Production and Construction Should Emphasize: Increasing Production of Export Goods

— Wang Naiyi

The author of this article, Mr. Wang Naiyi, has profound research in economic accounting and abundant writings. Currently, in addition to serving as an accounting consultant for various sectors, he also serves as the chief accountant of the Revitalize Tea Industry Company. The following article is indeed aimed at reality. —Editor

Our country has always been known as an import-surplus nation in international trade. After the War of Resistance, all commercial ports nationwide fell into enemy hands, and all foreign exchanges, except for military necessities, almost entirely ceased exporting commodities. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, all foreign trade was on the verge of stagnation. Since the victory, various parties have been shouting the slogan of restoring foreign trade. However, one should know that although an import surplus state is inevitable for an industrially immature country, striving to reduce the import surplus figures is not only something that the government authorities should pay attention to but also something that the nation's 450 million people should try to rectify. Now that the War of Resistance has just settled down, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt, we need foreign materials and various manufacturing machinery to help us; our expectations are sincere. At this time, talking about reducing the import surplus is not easy! The only method is to strengthen production and massively increase the export of tangible goods in order to remedy the import surplus of tangible goods. As for other measures to balance international payments, there are several intangible ones, which will be introduced in another article. At this moment, the author intends to briefly describe the current situation of tangible export trade:

Looking back to the period from the teens to the twenties of the Republic of China, trade figures were very calm, generally around one billion yuan or so. Up until the twenty-first year, due to the impact of the global recession and the occupation of the Northeast, the trade figures showed a significant decrease, some even dropping by half. Therefore, after the twenty-third and twenty-fourth years, the export trade volume was only a small amount of four to five hundred million yuan.

Furthermore, according to our country's export goods, raw materials have always accounted for the majority, which is enough to show the natural characteristics of an agricultural country's foreign trade. Since the Northeast was invaded, our country lost a large agricultural area that accounted for one-third of our export trade. Therefore, after the twenty-second year, raw materials fell to second place, while manufactured goods jumped to first place among export commodities; food and beverages further fell to third place. Among them, the rise of manufactured goods cannot be celebrated by the country, because their quantity has not increased, and it is caused by the most important factor: the bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of agricultural affairs. The author hereby specifically points this out to avoid being mistaken for industrial progress and mistakenly believing that our country has risen to become an industrially advanced country? Wouldn't that be absurd?

The manufactured goods mentioned above include cotton cloth, cotton yarn, raw silk, and silk fabrics; raw materials include cotton, wool, cocoons, solid and liquid fuels, raw cowhide, ore, seeds, and oil; food and beverages include rice, miscellaneous grains, bean noodles, sugar, vegetables, fruits, preserved fruits, candies, livestock, meat, egg products, fish products, salt, tea, wine, and tobacco. Among them, the details of oil, tea, cotton yarn, and raw silk are the largest. According to agricultural and industrial production categories, agricultural products still account for an absolute majority.

If our country wants to increase the export volume, it must promote the production of various commodities listed above on a large scale, especially agricultural products. At this moment, seeking to promote the production of manufactured goods to compete with advanced countries seems too premature. With our country's immature industry, coupled with years of war, it is like a weak body that has just recovered from a serious illness. How can we compete with countries with flourishing industries, advanced science, and all-powerful machines? Therefore, the most appropriate and candid criticism at the moment is that the production of industrial manufacturing can be self-sufficient and not be dumped by foreign goods, which is considered the best of the best. As for developing the export of manufactured goods, it still needs to go through a considerable amount of time; and agricultural production has always been our country's export characteristic, so we must not allow it to remain in a state of decline permanently. Therefore, increasing tangible export goods should be agricultural products as the primary goal.

Recently, I heard from a friend who returned from the United States that the level of mechanical industrial development in various countries makes it difficult for our country to catch up even after decades of effort. Even the military or commercial machinery, ships, and warships that various countries have transferred to our country are mostly obsolete and unusable waste products from those countries, which our country still regards as precious treasures, which is disheartening.

Although the level of various undertakings in our country is so low, it is not without remedy! On the one hand, we should start by cultivating talents, adding machinery, and improving and enhancing various production methods. On the other hand, we should promote our country's inherent natural resources and strive to increase production in order to restore our international trade position. Therefore, the author believes that when discussing production and construction issues, we should awaken everyone to pay great attention to agricultural production so that export trade will not abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, falling into a dangerous path. President Chiang mentioned in his broadcast speech on the Tenth National Day that the economic construction policy should emphasize both agriculture and industry; and pointed out that industrial progress must be based on the development of agriculture. On February 25th, the author stated in this newspaper the general situation of tea farmers' production in the important sector of agriculture, and the importance of its relationship with national economy and people's livelihood can be generally seen; other agricultural products can also be inferred by analogy. The author's suggestions in this article also seek to emphasize both agriculture and industry, but believes that to revitalize foreign trade, agricultural production should be increased first. As for industrial production, it is advisable to first focus on domestic operations, taking resisting foreign imports as the primary task; then gradually expand to Southeast Asia, and expand to Europe and the United States, so that it can be said to be the most practical method of taking both internal and external factors into consideration, and simultaneously developing agriculture and industry.

Finally, in addition to hoping that the government and financial institutions will earnestly assist in implementing low-interest loans, reducing product costs, strengthening transportation capacity, purchasing new machinery, and cultivating technical management talents, they should also promulgate measures to encourage increased production of export commodities and measures to encourage export trade, appropriately exempting part of the tariffs and transportation costs of export products, and actively undertaking export usance, in order to promote the smooth turnover of funds for export merchants; and facilitate export customs clearance procedures as much as possible; at the same time, it is hoped that the industry will pay special attention to agricultural products that occupy an important position in exports, invest heavily, and try their best to remedy various difficulties, to achieve the ultimate goal of the expected increase in agricultural production. The completion of the large-scale export of important export commodities, the revival of international markets, the reduction of import deficit figures, and the acquisition of foreign exchange chips are all deeply reliant on this.

### Production Construction and Enjoying One's Work

— Yao Siwei

In today's society, everything is advancing by leaps and bounds, which is very different from the past. Therefore, it will be even more difficult for future generations to establish themselves in society and achieve success. Because the faster the progress, the fiercer the competition. In this ever-progressing society, we have to struggle to find an opportunity to establish ourselves, and even further, to be able to achieve the goal of success. So, we must first understand how to succeed?

A successful person cannot lack knowledge, experience, cultivation, and effort, and even less can he lack the basic psychology of enjoying his work. Enjoying one's work refers to the love of one's profession and treating it as a lifelong career, enjoying it without fatigue, taking on complaints and hard work without any concern. Most of the world's industrial and commercial figures are created by the psychology of enjoying their work. They are diligent and strive forward every day, without any complacency, and constantly struggle. As such, even if there are any difficulties, they will be able to overcome them. My country's industry and commerce are backward, and we should have the psychology of enjoying our work. It is not only closely related to personal achievements, but also has a considerable impact on the prosperity and decline of the national economy.

Although in the past few years, I think there have also been those who have been lucky enough to achieve success and become wealthy merchants. In the enemy and puppet era, everything was abnormal, but in the future, there will definitely be no luck in achieving success. We must know that the psychology of luck is the shadow of success in a career, and we must not have it in our minds again. We must regard the psychology of luck as an obstacle to success. In the current era, everyone should rise up, make the best use of their talents, and rush into the progressive society to become a hard-won successful person. Moreover, in production and construction, we can also achieve good results.

### Introduction to Industrial and Commercial Management

— Xu Baiyi

(3) The Talent Problem

No matter what, to achieve success, you need the right talent. It is true that "things are done by people." In the operation of a business, you need even more talent.

This time, after eight years of the War of Resistance, many talents have left their original jobs and changed their professions. Many talents who originally possessed considerable morality have become bad elements due to the bad environment. Therefore, in the past eight years, talent has only decreased and has not increased. For the sake of future development, the cultivation of talent is really a matter of urgency.

According to the principles of management, a perfect management talent must have the following components, which can be used as a reference for cultivating or selecting talents:

1.  Ambition: A person who wants to progress must first have ambition. If he hopes to be able to achieve that step, he should have that kind of ambition as early as possible. The founder of the American Tobacco Company, Duke, helped his father sort out tobacco leaves when he was young. At that time, he felt that the tobacco business had a lot of development potential, so he was determined to develop in this area. As a result, because he had ambition first, and then went through continuous efforts, he finally succeeded.

2.  Knowledge: A person's knowledge is the accumulation of experience obtained indirectly or directly. When we join a business and start serving, we should always pay attention. We should study everything we can get in touch with.

3.  Creative Spirit: People with management skills are mostly creative. When they see something that should be reformed, they go ahead and reform it. Once upon a time, a person was buying things in a department store in Chicago. While waiting for the goods to be wrapped, he saw a young clerk walk up to the manager and suggest that the arrangement of that part should be reformed, and explained the method of reform. The situation at that time gave him a deep impression. That young clerk later became the owner of London's largest department store, Gordon Selfridge.

4.  Thoroughness: To take on major affairs, a person should be able to do various things very thoroughly, observe them meticulously, and work perfectly. A person who can do things thoroughly can take on greater responsibilities.

5.  Analytical Power: This point is a bit similar to the fourth point. Many management talents who have not been trained judge things according to the surface of things and do not delve into the details of things. If he is a truly capable management talent, then when he wants to solve a problem, he must analyze it in detail, and see all aspects of the matter—the good aspects and the bad aspects—as well as the various interests and relations.

6.  Judgment: With analytical power, if there is no judgment ability, then things still cannot be carried out, and sometimes many good opportunities will be missed. Especially in modern times, everything must be decided in the shortest period of time, so if there is no judgment ability, there can be no quick decision, which will delay affairs if small, and mislead the great plans of the business if large.

7.  Organizational Ability: Since a business cannot be carried out by one person or one single part, a responsible authority must have the ability to organize, so that each part can cooperate fully, the progress of affairs is very smooth, and the relationship between colleagues is very harmonious.

8.  Concrete Ideals: A person's ideals are the primary condition for his progress. If there is no ideal, there will be no progress, but his ideal should be concrete, otherwise there will be no possibility of realization.

9.  Ability to Adapt to the Environment: A management talent must have the ability to adapt to the environment, because in front of him, suddenly there are many documents piled up, waiting to be processed urgently, and suddenly he has to deal with foreign guests. If he does not have the ability to adapt to the environment, then he will definitely get flustered and disorderly, and it will also be enough to affect his judgment ability.

10. Leadership Talent: This is related to organizational talent. A management talent must have a kind of leadership skill. He can direct others to implement his ideas and can cooperate with them to jointly handle the progress of affairs.

11. Elegant Demeanor: In today's various environments, impression is very important. If a person can give a good impression, it is very helpful for his own progress and the progress of affairs. To have an elegant demeanor, he must have a strong physique and excellent etiquette in dealing with people.

12. Ability to Apply Various Principles: To be a management talent, you must be able to apply various principles, because to promote a business, there must be reasonable arrangements everywhere. If there is no ability to apply principles, then it is often easy to act on personal impulse and will not succeed.
