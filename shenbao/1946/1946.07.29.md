### Regarding the Issue of Military Reorganization; the Government Determines Its Established Policy; Continues to Negotiate Openly with the Chinese Communist Party

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Dispatch] An authoritative source informed our reporter about the crux of the issues in the KMT-CPC political negotiations over the past six months. Since the issuance of the ceasefire order on January 10th, the government has consistently adhered to the ceasefire. However, the Communist Party continued to occupy major cities after January 10th. Although there was a second ceasefire order on June 7th, the Communist army disregarded it and launched large-scale attacks. The government was forced to retaliate in self-defense under unavoidable circumstances. When the reporter inquired about the battles taking place in various parts of Northern Jiangsu, the Communist Party claimed that they were suppressing puppet troops. When asked whether this claim was true, the source replied, "May I ask, were there really puppet troops in Taixing, which the Communist army once occupied?" The Communist Party's statement is clearly a pretext for launching attacks. The reporter further inquired about the issue of administrative power after the Communist army withdraws from Northern Jiangsu. The Communist Party has stated that it can be decided by popular election. The reporter asked whether the government could accept this. The source stated, "The most difficult point in the troop withdrawal issue lies here. Because the Communist side insists on retaining administrative power, it has continued to attack after the ceasefire order. Its purpose is to change the administrative system of each city it occupies, so that its scope expands daily. If it is said that a government elected by the people will be implemented after its withdrawal, then why did it not adopt a method of popular election at the beginning of its occupation, allowing the people to decide whether to retain the original government or change it? Therefore, if the Communist Party withdraws from various regions today, its local administrative power should be restored to the original state when the National Army withdrew. In other words, the Communist Party should actually withdraw its administrative power." The source then stated, "Regarding the issue of military reorganization, it should have started on July 1st, and the numbers were as follows: the government army would be reduced to 90 divisions in the first phase and 50 divisions in the second phase. The Communist Party would be reduced to 18 divisions in the first phase and 10 divisions in the second phase. The progress of this reorganization must be announced to the American side at any time. However, if we look at the government side today (with officer corps everywhere and surplus officers everywhere), it has already reduced its forces from the original 300 divisions to 90 divisions, while the Communist Party has not yet announced its designations and reorganization status. This is the biggest proof that the Communist Party cannot implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. As for the so-called defense zone system, there is actually no such name. It is simply a matter of garrison locations. If the Communist army is reduced to 18 divisions in the future, how many areas should they be garrisoned in, and can it be coordinated with the existing areas? All of this should be discussed." The source finally stated, "Some people have said that all parties are waiting for the Chairman to issue a ceasefire order. In fact, a ceasefire order cannot be issued unilaterally by the government. The Communist Party's willful distortion and propaganda are of no benefit to the negotiations. In the future, the government should continue to negotiate with the greatest sincerity under the established policy, maintain a calm attitude, and not engage in unilateral propaganda, nor be swayed by any propaganda."

### Li Minran Visits Du Zhang Again; Restores the Xiaofengman Power Transmission Line to Shenyang; Li Signs an Agreement with Mayor Dong

[Central News Agency Shenyang 28th Dispatch] Lin Biao's representative, Li Minran, visited Chief Du again today for a three-hour discussion. Li also visited Zhang Jia'ao for a discussion of about two hours, and signed an agreement with Mayor Dong on restoring the Xiaofengman power transmission line to Shenyang. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Chief Du.

[Central News Agency Shenyang 28th Dispatch] The electricity supply for Liaoning and Shenyang relied on the Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant. After the Soviet army withdrew, the supply was cut off and the electricity has not been restored to Shenyang. Mayor Dong has discussed this issue twice with Li Minran, the representative of the Communist Party who came to Shenyang, and a concrete solution has been drafted. The power transmission line from Meihekou to Nanlimu, a section of about one hundred kilometers under the control of the Communist Party, has been agreed to be repaired by two teams of technical personnel sent by the government, starting from both ends on August 1st. The safety of the engineering personnel is the sole responsibility of the Communist Party. After the power line is repaired, the Communist army will be responsible for protecting it and will not damage it again. The government will supply electricity to Harbin, Qingyuan, Liuhe, and Jinchuan. The transmission lines to Harbin will be surveyed by personnel from both sides in their respective areas, who will be responsible for repairing them. After all the repairs are completed, electricity transmission will be restored simultaneously in each area. It is estimated that if the damage to the power lines is not significant, the repairs can be completed within two weeks.

[United Press Beiping 28th Dispatch] The KMT and CPC representatives of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun Forward Branch have accepted the US representative's proposal to establish a buffer zone in the Songhua River and Hailong areas, with both armies withdrawing to temporarily avoid conflict and facilitate negotiations. It is heard that the establishment of the buffer zone is not intended to be the basis for dividing the garrison areas of the KMT and CPC armies in the Northeast.

Confucius looked at it and kept saying, "Tedious, tedious." Amidst a burst of laughter from the reporters, the interview ended.

### Madame Chiang's Life in Lushan is Simple, Elegant, and She Does Not Give Up Work

— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu from Our Newspaper in Guling

Almost every day after breakfast, at noon, and as the sun sets and the lights come on, in the misty clouds of Lushan, if you step onto the poetic Jianguo Road, lined with verdant trees and divided by a flowing spring, you will often see the Chairman and Madame, and sometimes Madame Marshall, leisurely strolling, or going out for a ride in a sedan chair, or returning after a tour, or a scene of relaxing in the garden of the Ma Gongguan. Every time I see the happy mood revealed on Madame's face, I feel even more the beauty of this fairyland. Madame Chiang's life on the mountain can be said to be as simple and elegant as the Chairman's, but equally, she has not given up work. Every morning around 7:00 AM, Madame and the Chairman get up together to pray for half an hour. Sometimes, if Madame feels a little unwell or lacks sleep, she will rest for a while after praying. Her breakfast is also very simple, usually two eggs, one or two slices of toast, some fruit, and a cup of cocoa. Madame does not like to drink milk very much. Like the Chairman, she has the same habit of reading the newspaper at breakfast. After breakfast, she either takes a walk with the Chairman nearby, or goes to the opposite door to play chess with Madame Marshall. Then she goes to her private office to handle various important matters related to the women's community. Usually, when there are official English matters, Madame personally drafts the documents and gives them to her secretary, Ms. Chen Chunlian, to organize and type. If it is a Chinese official matter, it is handled by a secretary named Liu Tongzhen. This time, because there is a little free time from official duties on the mountain, only Ms. Chen came. In addition to handling official business, Madame also often writes, and most of her works are sent abroad for publication.

Around 11:00 AM, Madame often goes to the garden to personally supervise the gardeners in arranging flowers and trees. Madame's love for flowers is truly unparalleled. No matter what garden she passes by, if she sees beautiful and lovely flowers, she must stop to admire them. If she can find a way to bring some home, she will be very happy. And she especially pays attention to the art of flower arrangement. She absolutely does not like to stuff a bunch of flowers stiffly into a vase. Therefore, all the flowers in the official residence are arranged by an attendant with artistic talent.

Sometimes, Madame uses this time (after 11:00 AM) to receive guests. The people who are often summoned include Chief Executive Huang Renlin, Military Aide Pi Zonggan, and representatives from the women's community. Mr. and Mrs. Smice, the US Consul General in Tianjin, are also her guests. However, after coming to the mountain, Madame's closest friend is Madame Marshall. Madame's hospitality and sincerity towards Madame Marshall are truly remarkable. Not only did she send her own Western cuisine chef to her place to cook for her, but she also went to the Ma Gongguan almost every noon to have lunch with Madame Marshall. Madame eats more Western food, and she dislikes dishes with a strong fishy smell. At dinner, the Chairman eats two and a half bowls of rice, and sometimes some porridge, but Madame does not like to eat porridge very much. Madame usually drinks clear tea, and always puts two daisies in her tea. She does not drink alcohol often, except when it is necessary to entertain guests. Sometimes, she will go for a picnic to scenic spots at noon.

After lunch, she does not necessarily take a nap every day. Sometimes she talks with Madame Marshall, plays chess, or strolls on the street. When she goes to the street, she likes to look at the items displayed in the shop windows and ask about the prices. Everyone knows that Madame's clothing and supplies are not lacking compared to any lady or miss, but probably few people know the extent of her thrift. Even if a pair of silk stockings is torn, she has to mend it before wearing it again. All the expenses of the official residence, up and down, must be approved by her before they can be processed.

When she walks on the street, she will definitely go up to pat the shoulders, touch the heads of the children, regardless of whether they are poor or rich, and ask them their surnames, what they are called, where they are from, and how old they are. When she sees them dirty, she tells them to go back and wash clean. Madame's loving heart can be seen from this. When strolling, if she comes across fresh corn or other things planted in the fields by the villagers, she will often have the attendants buy some to take home.

From afternoon to evening, she sometimes receives guests, sometimes attends gatherings. If she happens to receive foreign guests, she will serve as the translator. Before dinner, she goes out for a walk with the Chairman or Madame Marshall again. Because Madame Marshall is very lonely here alone, Madame always invites her to dine at her residence together. If the Chairman has guests who need to be talked to at the table, Madame and Madame Marshall will dine separately.

After dinner, if the weather is clear and the moonlight is bright, she will stroll for a while outside the house or in the garden. Madame loves music. There is a piano in the official residence, and when Madame is in a good mood, she will play a piece herself. Music on the radio is also often listened to. She goes to bed around 11:00 PM, and still goes to the office to work for a while before going to sleep.

Madame's clothing on the mountain is sometimes a long cheongsam and sometimes Western trousers. In summer, her preferred colors are light green or blue and white patterns. She rarely wears high heels after going up the mountain, and has already switched to half-high heels for walking. (Sent from Lushan on July 25th)

### US Ambassador Falls Ill Due to Fatigue; Marshall and Others Visited Him Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Guling 28th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart arrived on the mountain on the 27th and immediately felt unwell, but still held three talks with Marshal Marshall and plans to report the results of the talks to the Chairman. According to relevant sources, there was no new development in the ambassador's talks with Zhou Enlai in Nanjing. Zhou only reported the Kunming incident to Ambassador Stuart, wanting to gain Ambassador Stuart's sympathy, and did not discuss political issues.

### 共產軍隊在河北北部決堤　楊村各地被淹沒　河北省政府電軍事調處執行部請求制止

[This Newspaper Tianjin, 28th] With the flood season approaching its peak, the Communist army in Hebei Province is widely exploiting the season by digging up riverbanks. Several dikes along the Grand Canal in Wuqing County and near Yangcun have already been breached by Communist forces. The National Army's defense area in Xincheng County along the Daqing River has also been flooded due to the Communist army's deliberate breach of the dikes. Rivers are overflowing incessantly. The Hebei Provincial Government has sent a telegram to the Military Mediation Department, requesting them to intervene and stop these actions.

[This Newspaper Beiping, 28th] Sources in transportation circles have learned that the Communist army breached the southern bank of the Majiaqiao dam, located thirteen *li* north of Yangcun west of Tianjin, at 3:00 AM this morning. The floodwaters are flowing south, already inundating several villages. Furthermore, Lutai on the Beining Railway is currently under threat from the Communist army, which has deployed 3,000 troops ten *li* to the north and over 600 troops six *li* to the west.

[Central News Agency Beiping, 27th] Reliable sources confirm that the Communist army east of the Pingbao Line, in order to hinder the restoration of county administration, is taking advantage of the heavy flooding of the Daqing and Fu Rivers to breach their dikes. Detailed information obtained from relevant sources is as follows: (1) The Baigou Town (70 *hua li* southeast of Gaobeidian Station) area, located between Xincheng and Rongcheng counties on the east bank of the Daqing River, has long been occupied by Communist forces. Recently, due to heavy flooding, the Xincheng County Brigade of the Chinese Communist Party led local laborers to breach the eastern bank of the river one *li* north of the town. The water is spreading southeast, intending to obstruct the military and administrative restoration work in Xiong County. Currently, dozens of villages in the Biantang area southeast of Xincheng, the northern and eastern districts of Xiong County, and the southwestern part of the county are completely submerged, resulting in widespread misery and crop failure. (2) The Communist Brigade stationed inside Anxin County City supervised local laborers to breach the northern dike of the Fu River. The breach is located at the Laohetou Village in Anxin County. The water flow is significant, and the area north and east of Dongan Town (30 *li* east of Baoding) in Qingyuan County, as well as villages and towns in northern Anxin, are now a vast expanse of water. Autumn crops have been destroyed, houses have collapsed, and villagers are homeless, creating a truly tragic situation.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 27th] The water level in the old course of the Yellow River within Xuzhou City is rising sharply. Investigation reveals this is due to mountain torrents. Jinpu Town has already been flooded. The city government and police department are actively supervising the construction of dikes.

### A Legendary News Story: The Disappearance of Sun Zhongyuan – Abducted but then Calling the Garrison Command Himself – Police Found Sun at the Address Given in a Private Residence

[This Newspaper Beiping, 28th] Regarding the disappearance of Sun Zhongyuan, a member and spokesperson of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, this reporter has learned from reliable sources the following account of this legendary event: Sun Zhongyuan went out with his sister at 4:00 PM on the 18th and was abducted by a car that came up from behind. Subsequently, the Beiping branch of the Democratic League reported the case, requesting the Beiping City authorities to investigate. Zhang Dongsun intended to host a press conference to explain the situation, but this did not materialize. Then, the Beiping Garrison Command suddenly received a phone call. The caller said, "I am Sun Zhongyuan. Please come to a certain location to protect me." The Garrison Command immediately dispatched personnel, who indeed found Sun in a private residence with three or four women present. Upon questioning, Sun first asked, "Can you guarantee my safety?" The reply was: "Yes!" Sun then produced two letters he had written in advance, one addressed to a certain news agency and the other to a certain newspaper. The letter to the newspaper also included a letter for the Beiping负责人 (person in charge) of the Democratic League. The letter to the news agency stated that, having seen reports that the Democratic League seemed to be using him as a propaganda tool, he wished to declare that "I (Sun referring to himself) am not a member of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Democratic League. I only participated in the Democratic League in order to strive for democracy, peace, and unification." The letter to the newspaper was similar in content. The letter to the Beiping负责人 of the Democratic League expressed dissatisfaction with the Democratic League's advocacy for the Communist Party. At this point, Sun still did not explain the reasons for the incident but repeatedly questioned the Garrison Command personnel in a tense tone: "How can you guarantee my safety?" The Garrison Command personnel replied that, to ensure absolute safety, he (Sun) should petition Director Li Zongren. Upon hearing this, Sun was greatly alarmed, believing that the individuals who came to protect him were not specifically guaranteeing his safety, and promptly fainted, losing consciousness. The Garrison Command personnel have already requested a doctor to administer a stimulant injection and are providing protection. Further developments will depend on Sun's recovery. The letters to the news agency and newspaper will only be released after a thorough investigation.

### Luo Longji Discusses "Neutrality," Saying Zhang Lan Misunderstood Its Meaning

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 28th] Regarding the internal disputes within the Democratic League, Luo Longji stated: "Zhang Lan has misunderstood the meaning of my 'neutrality.' In terms of the party's position, the Democratic League should remain neutral between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, what I mean by not being able to be neutral is in relation to the civil war. Every Chinese citizen cannot remain neutral regarding the domestic war; otherwise, they would not be a true Chinese person." It is reported that Luo has sent a letter to Zhang Lan, requesting him to send the full text of his previous statement in Chengdu to Nanjing for further study.

### American History Professor Writes Book: A History of US-Russian Competition in the Far East

[Associated Press San Francisco, 27th] "A History of US-Russian Competition in the Far East - A Study of Diplomatic Policy and Great Power Politics" by Cyprian Bridge, Associate Professor of History and International Relations at Newark University, has been published by the University of Pennsylvania Press.

### Whereabouts of Former Manchukuo Empress Qiuhong Unknown

[Central News Agency Changchun, 27th] Since the Japanese surrender, the whereabouts of the former Manchukuo Empress Qiuhong have been unknown. A former attendant of Puyi from 通化 (Tonghua) claims that, following the Soviet air raid on Puyi, the family and servants fled to Dali Village in Linjiang County, then to Tonghua. He claims that Qiuhong has always been nearby since then. It is said that three days before the Japanese surrender, on August 12th, Puyi fled with his family and about sixty palace attendants to Dali Village in Linjiang County after Soviet planes bombed 通化. Puyi then flew to the northeast but was captured by the Soviet army midway. At that time, Qiuhong and others remained in Linjiang. In January of this year, when the Communist army captured Linjiang, they were detained and stripped of their jewelry, Tang and Song calligraphy, and various jade and precious stones. These jewels were worth about 200 million流通劵 (circulation notes). After being imprisoned in Linjiang for two months, they were sent to 通化, but many of the attendants had been scattered. Only seventeen people went to 通化. After the Communist army captured Changchun, a certain political commissar took them to Changchun on April 29th, but three days later they were transferred to Yongji. At this time, only Qiuhong, Puyi's sister-in-law, and their children were traveling together. A few days before the National Army entered Yongji, they were sent back to 通化, but dispersed on the way. Their whereabouts are now unknown. The attendant also said that Qiuhong and Puyi had a poor relationship. Qiuhong was thin and addicted to opium, and her nerves were often unstable.

After the autumn harvest, a new resolution on the public sale of grain will be implemented, first in 京沪 (Nanjing and Shanghai), and then in major cities. Zhejiang Province plans to pilot it first in the three major consumer markets of Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Yongjia, implementing fixed quantity allocation, and then extend it to other important counties.

Silver Store Robbed of Large Quantity of Gold

The Xinfu Jiuji Silver Store at No. 108 Xizhong Market in Chuangmen Nei, Suzhou, was broken into by seven robbers at around 2:00 AM on the 25th. They entered through the back door along the river kitchen, each armed with nine short guns. The iron boxes in the vault were destroyed, and more than 70 *liang* (unit of weight) of gold (including more than 250 pieces of jewelry) and more than 2.4 million legal currency were looted, resulting in a loss of more than 20 million yuan. On the morning of the 26th, the City Defense Headquarters recovered eight short guns at the Songfuji Shouchi Store at No. 43 Xiatang Hengjie. In the afternoon, the police station found military uniforms and other items in the store. It is said that the case has yielded clues and is expected to be solved soon.

Allocation of Stored Rice for Famine Relief – The Wuxian Grain Storage Association had an original storage of 7,000 *shi* (unit of volume) of rice, but 4,000 *shi* were allocated to subsidize public school teachers last month. Recently, given that the season is between harvests and the poor, elderly, and disabled are experiencing hardship, even though rice prices have slightly recovered, they still cost about 50,000 yuan per *shi*. Therefore, they will use the stored rice to implement famine relief. They will mill 1,500 *shi* of rice into white rice and open the famine relief in late August. The urban areas and towns will compile a register of poor households, and each household will be able to purchase five *sheng* (unit of volume) of rice per week, calculated at 60% of the market price.

Wuxi – Beautiful Wife and Singer Succumb to Poison One After Another

The Liang Juxin Garden restaurant on Nanchang Street, outside the South Gate of this county, is opened by Hua Arong and has been operating for more than thirty years. The restaurant is thriving because of its location in a busy area. The young owner of the restaurant, Hua Dechang (nicknamed Agou), married a woman named Yao, who is currently twenty-five years old. They have been married for six years, and their relationship has been harmonious. On the third day of the lunar New Year this year, Dechang met a singer named Chen Mengping at the Xianle teahouse. They fell in love and were very close. When his wife Yao heard about it, she advised him with kind words, but Dechang ignored her, and they argued several times without result. In anger, Yao decided to commit suicide. At around 1:00 PM on the 26th, she swallowed two bottles of Lysol. She was sent to Puren Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. She died fifteen minutes later. At the same time, after the singer Chen Mengping heard that Dechang's wife had committed suicide by poisoning, she felt responsible for this crime and swallowed half a box of赛塔 (brand name) matches.

Editorial

### Wishing the European Peace Conference Success!

The European Peace Conference opens today at the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. Representatives from twenty-one countries are attending. The opening address will be given by the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Our country’s Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and diplomatic envoys stationed abroad are also participating. This is the first peace conference after the war, and its main purpose is to clean up the aftermath of the war in Europe. People all over the world who yearn for peace are expressing their deep expectations for this European Peace Conference with joy. The biggest task of this conference is to sign peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, so that a part of war-torn Europe can return to peace as soon as possible. Therefore, the significance of this conference is significant and cannot be compared to ordinary international conferences. When U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes boarded a special plane in Washington to fly to Paris, President Truman held a farewell ceremony for him, wishing the conference success, and earnestly urged: "The American people are determined to fully support a just and reasonable peace based on the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter." This gives Byrnes not only a supreme principle to adhere to when attending the conference to discuss European issues but also a reliable backing in case of disputes with representatives from other countries.

It has been more than a year since the European war ended with the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. During this period, politicians and diplomats from various countries have exhausted their wisdom and ability to repeatedly convene international conferences, such as the Potsdam Big Three Conference, the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference, the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, all in order to enable the European countries after the war to return to their normal state as soon as possible, and the people who have suffered from the war can also escape from the fire and water and ascend to a comfortable seat as soon as possible. However, after twists and turns and exhaustive efforts for more than a year, this European Peace Conference could finally be convened. The difficulty of creating world peace is really no less than striving for victory in wartime.

Looking ahead to the future of the European Peace Conference today, we must not be pessimistic just because it is not easy to create peace. The more difficult it is to obtain something in the world, the more precious it feels. We believe that human conscience will overcome various difficulties and achieve final success in striving for peace. After the great disaster, the people of all countries in the post-war world deeply reflect on the pain and yearn for peace. It can be said that everyone has the same heart and the same principle. As long as there are no more Hitlers, Mussolinis, or Tojos who suffer from the delusion of "ruling the world", then we dare to say that the scourge of world war will not rise again, and permanent peace will surely be realized one day. There is really no reason to be "discouraged" or "disappointed" at this moment. As long as everyone has determination and a sense of justice, and for this conference, "only success is allowed, and failure is not allowed," then the outcome of this conference will surely sow many seeds of peace in Europe and will also make a considerable contribution to the entire world peace.

However, creating peace is everyone's common goal, but how to achieve the goal of peace has indispensable preconditions:

First, the creation of world peace should adopt democratic methods, because the people of all countries in the post-war world hope that the post-war world can enter a new era of peace and democracy, and they all agree that true world peace cannot be achieved until international democracy is realized. Looking back at modern history, the outbreak of international wars has always been the result of the evil of international power politics. And observing the relations between countries in the past year, there is still only a rebalancing of "power," and all issues are determined by "power" factors. Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union are competing for hegemony, especially the Soviet Union and the United States each have their subjective world policies, while Britain vacillates between the two, hoping to maintain its important status as a powerful country in the rebalancing of "power." This European Peace Conference may be an excellent opportunity for power politics to display its magical powers. If this style cannot be changed, and everyone only recognizes "power" and ignores "reason," and still believes that "power is reason," and only regards the conference as a banquet for entertaining guests, and all issues are determined by a few powerful countries, and even the agenda is not allowed to be discussed and decided by everyone, and the representatives of general weak and small countries only take this opportunity to visit Paris, dance, or attend cocktail parties and tea parties, then the future of the conference may not live up to the expectations of the world. To realize the principle of international democracy, we believe that the "veto power" of the minority controlling the majority should be abolished to avoid abuse.

Second, when discussing any issue at the conference, the representatives of all countries should base their opinions on international justice, without any malicious intent of revenge, and then a reasonable and fair solution can be sought. Only in this way can it be done once and for all. Otherwise, only seeking the present and ignoring the future; or only seeking one's own pleasure and not thinking about whether others can bear it; or only knowing temporary compromise and abandoning principles, these are not thorough and fundamental solutions, and they cannot establish a century-long plan for human peace. President Truman said that the United States supports a fair peace based on the two major charters. This sentence has profound meaning and deserves the common consideration of the twenty-one national representatives attending the conference. The peace treaty after the First World War is our lesson.

In short, it is certainly not easy to create world peace, but by accumulating the common efforts of mankind, it will surely succeed. The convening of this conference is another step towards peace. We should happily wish the conference success, and at the same time insist on international democracy and justice as the supreme principles for creating peace, and urge the representatives of all countries to abide by them so that this world can truly enter a new era of peace and democracy.

### Twenty-one National Representatives Gather at Luxembourg Palace European Peace Conference Opens Today British Prime Minister Attlee to Attend in Person Soviet Delegation Totals Three Hundred

[Our Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcast: In twenty-three hours, the world-renowned Peace Conference will hold its opening ceremony at the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. Representatives from various countries have arrived in Paris one after another. Attendees today include British Prime Minister Attlee, Alexander, and Canadian Prime Minister King. French President Bidault expressed his welcome to the representatives of various countries, stating France’s confidence in cooperating with the three powers, and deeply believing that the conference will be successful.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th Special Dispatch] The Peace Conference with the participation of twenty-one countries will open at the Luxembourg Palace at 4 p.m. tomorrow, writing the first chapter of peace after World War II. Its task is strictly limited to discussing the draft treaties with the former German allies Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. This conference will not discuss the issues of Germany, Austria, or Japan. Several country peace conferences will be opened later for discussion. The general public attaches great importance to this Paris Peace Conference, as this will be a precedent for future peace conferences.

[Reuters, London, 27th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin is unable to attend the opening ceremony of the Peace Conference in Paris due to health reasons. Prime Minister Attlee will personally attend instead. Other attending representatives include Sea Minister Alexander, Foreign Secretary McNeil, and Treasury Financial Secretary Hall. Bevin has been ordered by his doctor to rest for at least one week. During the Prime Minister's absence, Lord President Morrison will act as Prime Minister. According to the agency's diplomatic correspondent, the opening phase of the Paris Peace Conference may not involve issues that require Bevin's special experience. The treaties of the five countries have been largely agreed upon, and Britain's attitude has already been clearly expressed. However, the issues of Germany, Austria, and Palestine may be discussed outside the conference at the same time, and Bevin's rich experience seems especially indispensable when discussing the German issue.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th Special Dispatch] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie led a delegation of Wu Nanru, Bao Yi, and six other members, arriving in Paris this afternoon. Those who welcomed them at the scene were Chuan Bingchang, Liang Long, Jin Jiansi, Qian Tai, and Colonel Delebeamont, the representative of the French Provisional President Bidault.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th Special Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky arrived here this afternoon from Moscow by plane. The Soviet delegation totaled more than 300 people, traveling on five planes, landing one after another. The Soviet delegation included for the first time Lithuanian Foreign Minister Rotanskis, Estonian Foreign Minister Fareskam, and Latvian Foreign Minister Kra, led by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky and Belarusian Foreign Minister Kiseime respectively. The delegations of the two countries also arrived in Paris this afternoon by plane.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 27th] It has been learned that the Indian delegation to the Peace Conference will be led by the Minister of Indian Affairs, Lawrence.

Provisional Suspension of Announcement of Draft Treaties of the Five Countries

[Our Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcast: According to the London Foreign Office, the directive regarding the indefinite cancellation of the publication of the clauses of the draft treaties of the five countries Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria will be issued from London this afternoon, stating that any part of the treaty must be published from Paris. The Soviet Union had previously agreed to publish the parts of the treaty that had been agreed upon, but suddenly overturned the previous agreement last night.

[United Press, London, 28th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated today that the Council of Foreign Ministers has decided not to publish the full text of the treaties of the five countries Italy, Finland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, speculating that the reason must be that the U.S., Britain, the Soviet Union, and France "failed to reach an agreement on what should be published and what should not be published." The parts of the full text of the treaty that have been agreed upon by the four countries were handed over to the press yesterday, scheduled to be published at 11 p.m. today. This permission has now been revoked.

### Wishing That All Countries Show Sincerity to Establish World Peace Byrnes Issues Statement Before Departure

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Secretary of State Byrnes addressed a crowd of 2,000 welcomers at the airport this afternoon before departing for Paris, stating that the United States will never return to a policy of isolation. He said that the situation today is completely different from when World War I ended. There are no longer conflicts between government departments within our country, but rather a state of working together with one heart. The world cannot trust a divided United States. I hope that the first set of treaties can be signed at the end of this conference. Peace must come from the heart of mankind to be effective. President Truman wished Byrnes success on this trip and told him that the United States will be the backing of the United Nations, hoping to establish peace based on the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter. The British and French ambassadors also saw Byrnes off at the airport.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, broadcast a declaration by Secretary of State Byrnes before attending the Paris Peace Conference, stating that the United States is determined to make this conference the beginning of peace efforts and will never let it be the end of peace work. He also said that the hope of avoiding a new war of terror depends on whether the causes of friction left over from the war can be eliminated. He said, after months of effort, I feel that we have stepped onto the path of peace. In a world where countries jealously safeguard their sovereignty, there is no real peace-making process. Making peace requires seeking compromise, and the progress made so far is also the result of compromise. Before the task is completed, compromise must continue, but this so-called compromise refers to reconciling honest conflicts of opinion, not obtaining selfish benefits for oneself or others. Today, we should not only help make peace but also make it an effective peace. We should cooperate with various countries to establish peace and develop peace.

### Australian Foreign Minister Speaks in London

Creating World Peace

Should Adopt Democratic Methods

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, the head of the delegation attending the Peace Conference, arrived in Southampton, England, from New York and said that the goal of the Australian delegation is to obtain a reasonable and democratic peace, and it must be determined that democratic methods should be adopted to create peace, not only limited to the Paris Peace Conference. Afterwards, democratic methods should also be adopted in the relationship between Germany, Austria, and Japan. The Australian representatives will do their best to contribute to peace, so that they can be on par with the achievements of the Australian army, navy, and air force in various war zones during this war. Australia and Britain have an inseparable relationship because they share the same king and the same race, and they depend on each other for life. This has been fully demonstrated in the first and second world wars. For this reason, we have a direct interest in European issues. In short, Australia's main interest lies in the Pacific because it seeks a lasting solution based on justice and democracy. However, because Australia is a part of Britain, it can never stay out of Europe.

### Ambassador Zheng Arrives in England to Assume Office Taking Promoting Sino-British Relations as His Mission

[Reuters, London, 27th] Chinese Ambassador to England Dr. Zheng Tianxi arrived at London Airport this afternoon. British Foreign Office officials, staff from the Chinese Embassy, and his son welcomed him at the airport. After getting off the plane, Zheng said: "I am very happy to be here and feel extremely honored to take up this position. I will do my best to promote the friendship between China and Britain. This has become my main task."

### Conference Agenda

First Discuss the Treaty of Italy

[United Press, New York, 27th] The New York Times today carried a dispatch from Paris stating that the Treaty of Italy may be listed as the first item on the conference agenda. This treaty can prove that although the Council of Foreign Ministers has reached an agreement on many important points, it is not unanimous on other points or remains to be decided, and will ask the conference for instructions. The content of the treaty is definitely a draft rather than a treaty. The four powers have largely agreed on the Italian border, but there are still other proposals, such as the Italian-Yugoslav border line proposed by Yugoslavia and the free leadership of Italian Autriche Trieste. Although the four powers have agreed to Italy's reparations to the Soviet Union, they have not agreed on what kind of reparations should be given to France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Abyssinia. Although the special port has agreed to be managed internationally, the status of its government has not been determined. Although it has been agreed to postpone the decision on the Italian colonies in North Africa and East Africa for one year, the solution is not clearly stated in the draft.

### Japanese Defense Lawyer of the International Court Plans to Submit a Secret Telegram Proving Roosevelt Knew of the Breakup Early

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] A United Press reporter exclusively learned today that during the trial of Japanese war criminals here, the Japanese defense lawyers may use a Japanese secret telegram to prove that President Roosevelt and former Secretary of State Hull knew as early as November 28, 1941, that Japan had determined to make the peace talks break down. This news was revealed to the United Press alone by a defense lawyer, but he was unwilling to announce his name. The purpose of the defense lawyers' plan is to prove that senior U.S. officials should not be too surprised by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This person also said that U.S. military officers intercepted and deciphered a coded telegram sent by Japan from Tokyo to Washington on November 28, 1941, in which the Japanese government told the "peace envoys" sent to Washington that the negotiations would break down in two or three days. It is said that this telegram was deciphered on the same day after it was intercepted. If this telegram had been used, it would have been used as the basis for defensive work, because both the U.S. and Japan knew that war was coming, and Roosevelt and Hull pretended not to know, so that Japan took this action first. The United Press reporter further learned that this telegram expressed admiration for the "superhuman efforts" made by the Japanese representative sent to Washington, Mr. Gu, to achieve peace; but pointed out that the U.S. counter-proposal was too humiliating to Japan and could not be accepted. The Japanese diplomatic representatives sent to Washington learned from this telegram that they would soon receive the Imperial Government's views on the U.S. proposal in two or three days. The negotiations to this point will in fact be broken. It is said that the telegram stated that this situation was inevitable, but warned the representatives not to create the impression that the negotiations had broken down before the official note arrived.

### UN Military Staff Committee Watches World Situation Development

[United Press, New York, 7th] The United Nations Military Staff Committee, temporarily one of the most powerful groups in world history, is apparently making slow progress, closely monitoring the development of the world situation.

Its activities are extremely secret, and even today, six months after the meeting, it is not known if there is a chairman.

### Treaty Spirit Should Conform to Christian Doctrine

Pope Plans to Appeal to the Conference

[Agence France-Presse, Vatican, 27th] The "Italian Daily" published a news story today with a large headline, saying that Pope Pius XII plans to contact the Paris Peace Conference and appeal to the future peace treaty to be inspired by Christian doctrines. Former Popes Benedict XV and Pius XI also interfered in the same way in 1917. Officials here do not believe that the Pope will take this action at present, because the Pope has repeatedly called attention to investigating the responsibility of those who are not inspired by Christian doctrines and put the fate of mankind in danger. At the same time, according to the "Evening News," the Papal Secretariat of State has been reorganized and a Papal Secretary of State has been appointed. Officials pointed out that this matter has been mentioned some time ago, and the reorganization is within expectations.

### Trieste Intensifies Security

[Reuters, Trieste, 28th] As the Paris Peace Conference approaches, the security of the Trieste area has also been intensified. The remains of the Italian Communist Party member Battistella, who was shot and killed by the police, were paraded through the city yesterday, lasting two hours. Many people along the way paid their respects.

### France Notifies Austrian Government to Take Care of German Property in Occupied Area

[Reuters, Vienna, 27th] The French government officially notified the Austrian government, informing it that France intends to manage the German property in the French military zone in Austria in a way that is conducive to the revival of Austria. The French authorities have also taken steps to allow Austrian officials to participate in the management of the property. Before the final solution is reached, no decisions will be made regarding the property. Apart from Britain, all four powers have indicated to Austria their position on foreign assets. To date, Britain has only issued a "status quo" order in the British zone of Austria.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th Special Dispatch Delayed] The Siamese Ministry of Interior recently issued an order stating that overseas Chinese who were accused of participating in anti-Japanese activities under the Siamese dictator Phibul government in 1939 should be formally given a decision not to prosecute. This order affects more than 2,000 overseas Chinese, most of whom are wealthy businessmen.

### Old Man's Lament: Loudly Exhorting: Yuan Xiluo Fasts for Three Days: Advocates Dietary Restrictions to Aid Refugees in Northern Jiangsu: Plans to Fly to Yan'an for Final Admonition

Yuan Xiluo, a respected elder and educational pioneer in Jiangsu Province, recently went to Zhenjiang to attend a fundraising meeting for refugees in northern Jiangsu and visited refugee relief centers. Deeply saddened, he decided to fast for three days, donating the food saved during those three days to aid the refugees in northern Jiangsu. He also appealed to the elders in the counties south of the Yangtze River to embrace a compassionate spirit and actively donate to help. At the same time, he sent a telegram to Mao Zedong and Zhu De, imploring them to prioritize the people's lives and respect public opinion by promptly withdrawing the communist forces from northern Jiangsu, so that displaced compatriots could return to their hometowns as soon as possible. He also plans to borrow a plane in the coming days to fly directly to Yan'an and offer a final admonition through fasting. The original text of Yuan's handwritten letter and telegram are recorded below:

Telegram to Zhu and Mao Requesting a Prompt Withdrawal of Troops

Shanghai Central News Agency and all newspaper offices forward to Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Zhu De in Yan'an: Last November, Xiluo and fourteen elders in Shanghai jointly sent a telegram urging both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to cease hostilities. They pointed out that your army's destruction of railways was disrupting the flow of goods, leading to the suffering of the people who were without food and clothing and freezing to death. They planned to fly to Yan'an to dissuade your army from destroying the railways through fasting. Chairman Chiang did not allow the dispatch of a plane to send me to Yan'an because I was old, so Zhu Chengxing did not go. It has been eight months since then. Negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not succeeded, and conflicts continue. The 31 counties and cities of northern Jiangsu Province, with a population of 20 million, have suffered immensely from the enemy and puppet regimes during the War of Resistance, enduring extreme pain. In the eleven months since the victory, they have been subjected to the "struggle" and "confession" campaigns carried out by your party's military and political personnel, as well as the conscription of young men for the party's conflicts, leading to the destruction of families and widespread fear. In recent months, hundreds of thousands of people have fled to Xuzhou, Haizhou, Nantong, Taizhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and areas south of the Yangtze River. Xiluo went to Zhenjiang the other day and visited these refugee relief centers. Although the government and charitable people have donated money for relief, with millions of refugees, the daily need for rice is ten thousand stones, which is beyond their capacity. Therefore, the refugee camps are no different from hell on earth, where everyone is emaciated, barely clothed, and without resources for medical treatment when ill. Deaths are a common and unbearable sight. I have now decided to abstain from food for three days, donating the money saved to aid the refugees, and I am informing people in the counties south of the Yangtze River to join in this effort, fasting for one day each and using the money to aid the refugees. I earnestly request the two gentlemen to promptly withdraw your army from northern Jiangsu, so that the millions of displaced compatriots can return to their hometowns in the autumn and not freeze or starve to death. Do not let the people's resentment deepen, leading to your party's ultimate abandonment by the people. Nowadays, weapons are becoming more sophisticated, and the world has entered the atomic age. If you indulge in war to harm the country, it will inevitably lead to national demise and extinction. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are descendants of the Yellow Emperor, brothers from the same ancestor. If you fight for territory, causing people to die in the crossfire or be displaced and starve to death, it is truly fratricide. In February of this year, Xiluo wrote about Confucius's "Great Unity" and gave it to Mr. Zhou Enlai to send to the two gentlemen. Please read it carefully, as it contains the golden words of Chinese sages for saving humanity through public ownership. I hope you will adopt this principle and work with the people of the whole country to save China and the world. Xiluo plans to borrow a plane in the coming days to fly to Yan'an and engage with the two gentlemen through fasting. This telegram is sent in advance. Yuan Xiluo sends this telegram with deep emotion.

Appeal to the Elders for Widespread Sympathy

To the elders, brothers, and sisters in the counties south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, and to the elders, brothers, and sisters in Nanjing and Shanghai: On July 20th, Xiluo went to Zhenjiang. On the afternoon of July 21st, he attended a fundraising meeting for refugees in northern Jiangsu and visited refugee relief centers. He listened to the reports of refugee representatives and realized that the people of northern Jiangsu, due to the extraordinary actions of the communist military and political personnel, had lost all their property and could not guarantee their lives, forcing them to leave their homes and seek refuge in Xuzhou, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and surrounding areas. The relief of refugees in the refugee relief centers requires a massive amount of rice and flour. For 1.2 million people, 6,000 stones of rice or 600,000 catties of flour are needed daily. Although the government allocates funds and enthusiastic people donate, the amount is often insufficient. Therefore, the refugee camps are no different from hell on earth. The refugees are emaciated, and clothing is even more scarce. Fortunately, it is summer, so they will not freeze to death, but children are mostly naked, while adults must cover their lower bodies, using tattered cotton-padded jackets and trousers for covering, with no summer clothes in good condition. If they are sick, they lack medical resources and can only wait for death. Currently, the number of refugees whose names have been investigated is 600,000 in Xuzhou, including those who fled from Shandong and Henan, 500,000 in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and surrounding counties and cities, 100,000 in Nantong, and an estimated 3 million or more who are not in refugee centers but live with relatives and friends, or rent houses and live by begging in the countryside. Xiluo has witnessed and heard this and feels extremely saddened for these compatriots who have fled from communism. Recalling November 5th of last year, when the communist army prevented the National Army from carrying out the government's orders to take over lost territories and disarm the surrendered Japanese army, they destroyed the railways, fearing that not only would the National Army not be able to take over the lost territories, but also that the flow of goods would be disrupted, leading to the starvation of the people. Xiluo and fourteen elders in Shanghai sent a telegram to Chongqing and Yan'an, urging them to stop the internal conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Xiluo telegraphed his old friend Wu Zhihui, asking Chairman Chiang to send a plane to Shanghai to take me to Yan'an to dissuade Mao Zedong and Zhu De's extraordinary actions through fasting. Wu Zhilao did not agree with my fasting and did not send a plane, so I could not realize my plan to fast in Yan'an. Now, Xiluo has decided not to eat for three days, donating the food saved during those three days to aid the refugees from northern Jiangsu. Xiluo respectfully requests the elders, brothers, and sisters in the counties south of the Yangtze River, Nanjing, and Shanghai to support this effort, abstaining from food for one day each and using the food saved to aid the refugees from northern Jiangsu. The value of one day's food can be converted into cash and deposited in a nearby bank, which can be remitted to the Jiangsu Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. Such merit will be a hundred times greater than burning incense and chanting Buddha's name. I humbly wish you all good health. Seventy-one-year-old Yuan Xiluo respectfully declares, July 26th.

### Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association Provides Relief to Displaced Students

The Shanghai Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association convened a meeting on the 26th to provide relief to displaced youth, passing four important resolutions: (1) The procedure for distributing funds to students will be as follows: The school will identify students from northern Jiangsu in each class, create three copies of the roster, and appoint a representative to oversee the distribution together with personnel from relevant authorities. Students must also appoint a representative to assist in the handling of the disbursement. When receiving funds, students must bring their student ID card and seal, and follow the prescribed procedures. The use of funds received by students is limited to maintaining meals. Funds transferred to the cafeteria or bank will be handled by the school. (2) The amount of funds for student relief during the summer vacation will be 20,000 yuan per student per month, mainly to maintain meals. (3) Medical and other expenses for students who become ill will be handled by the office. (4) A "Temporary Student Relief Committee of the Shanghai Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association" will be established to handle future student relief matters. Hu Shenzheng, Fu Haiqiu, Lu Ticheng, and thirteen others were elected as committee members, with Lu Ticheng as the convener. Necessary office expenses for the committee will be allocated by the office.

### Can All Salaried Individuals in the City Donate One Day's Income?

The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association received a letter yesterday from an enthusiastic person, proposing to appeal to all civil servants and other salaried compatriots in the city to donate one day's income (applicable to all those with a fixed monthly income). According to statistics, there are approximately one million such salaried individuals, and the average daily income per person is at least 3,000 yuan, totaling over 3 billion yuan. The committee is currently considering this proposal.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Encourages Returning Technical Personnel at Reception: Should Acknowledge Domestic Difficulties and Prepare to Cope: Use Valuable Experience to Assist in Reconstruction

[Our Report] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, Vice Minister Bei Zheng, Pan Xulun, and others held a tea party at the Bank Club yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to receive a total of 114 members of the first batch of technical personnel sent to the United States by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for internships. Zhang Zijian, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and Chief Secretary Guo Keshu, among others, also attended. Minister Wang delivered a speech, stating: "I am very pleased to hold this tea party with you today. You were scheduled for a year to return home after completing your studies and participate in various wartime production tasks. Now that our country has won the War of Resistance, you will participate in postwar reconstruction work. The sudden arrival of this victory has made the people feel happy, but our country's preparation for postwar reconstruction was not sufficient. Therefore, there have been many uncoordinated phenomena after the victory. Taking industry as an example, the recession seems to be even more severe than during the war. However, this is an inevitable phenomenon of transitioning from wartime to a stage of peace. Generally, when transitioning from peace to wartime, people's minds tend towards hard work and endurance. Therefore, all difficulties, which are not easy to solve in the first place, can also be solved. However, transitioning from wartime to peace is different. People's minds generally tend towards excessive optimism. As a result, the reconstruction work that should have been done with redoubled efforts has suddenly been relaxed. Therefore, disappointment is expected and there is no need to be pessimistic. You have spent a year interning abroad, familiarizing yourself with the industrial facilities in foreign countries. Upon suddenly returning home, you may feel that all the facilities of domestic industry are uncoordinated, making it impossible to fully utilize what you have learned. However, before going abroad, you had been working in the industrial sector for many years, so you should be different from ordinary students studying abroad. I hope you will not view things too simplistically, lest you feel disappointed if you encounter setbacks. Therefore, there are two points that I expect from you now: (1) I deeply hope that you will recognize the various difficulties in our country, first study the details of the difficulties, and prepare to cope with them, so that you will not feel disappointed. (2) You have spent a year interning abroad and have seen how American industry transitioned from wartime to peacetime. The United States had prepared for postwar reconstruction early on and has rich experience. Therefore, I hope you will take these

Valuable Experience: Combine with National Conditions

Implement it into our country's reconstruction work. As for the issue of your service after returning home, during this reconstruction period, when various agencies need technical personnel, you should be able to find your place and do your best. According to the internship subjects, the dispatched personnel are divided into nine groups. I hope each group will elect a representative to report on the experience of going abroad for the internship." Subsequently, Vice Minister Xiao Zheng stood up and gave a speech, stating: "I would like to supplement Minister Wang's comments with a few words. I hope everyone will work hard to build China into a prosperous and strong country. In the past, our country was an economically invaded country. After this war, it jumped from a semi-colony to a world-class power. For the time being, let's put aside the victory or defeat on this battlefield, but the actual economic and industrial victory has not been achieved. The lessons of the eight-year War of Resistance show us that if our country wants to become prosperous and strong, we must work hard to build the foundation of economic and industrial development. Looking at countries like Britain and the United States, with economic foundations and industrial positions, they still need to go through a considerable period of time to complete reconstruction after a war. And our country

Economic Foundation: Always Fragile

Reconstruction work cannot be completed overnight. Therefore, the Central Government has already discussed a five-year reconstruction plan before the victory, aiming to build our country's economic strength in the fastest possible time. This plan has not been fully disclosed to society, but it is a preliminary plan to set a good economic path for our country. You are divided into nine groups to go abroad for internships, all in line with the needs of this plan. The foundation of this plan has two parts: (1) Build national transportation, (2) Build basic industries. Once these two departments are completed, we can gradually talk about the development of other light industries. However, even for these two departments, tens of thousands of specialized talents are needed. The government, in view of the drawbacks of the past laissez-faire study abroad system, has dispatched you based on this five-year plan. Therefore, I hope: (1) How to systematically coordinate you under the original plan, so that you can all use your strengths and serve the country. (2) I hope you will adhere to your respective positions and work hard under the premise of the entire country, in accordance with the original intention of the weaving family to send you, and cooperate with the needs of the country to complete this construction plan. In recent years, the economic systems of various countries have shifted from liberalism to planned economies. Britain and the United States all feel the need to assist a country's economic construction with the strength of politics and the state. Our country's economic system is centered on the Principle of People's Livelihood, and economic construction is also advancing in an organized and planned manner. Therefore, there should be no competition between state-owned and private enterprises, but mutual cooperation and development. I deeply hope that everyone can work together in accordance with this principle, then the development of our country's economy will have great prospects." The representative of the students, Mr. Huang Zhenxun

Delivered a response, Huang thanked Minister Wang and Vice Ministers Xiao and Pan on behalf of all the students for their kind invitation to the tea party. He also stated: "After returning home this time, with the guidance of the officials, we will not be at a loss. We feel that the wisdom of our people is no less than that of foreigners. However, American workers are mostly well-led, strictly managed, and live very stable lives, so they can work with peace of mind. We urge the government to ensure a stable life for all personnel who have completed their studies and returned home, so that they will of course do their best to assist in national construction."

Finally, Cai Jiali of the Electricity Group, Feng Zipei of the Mechanical Group, Meng Xiqian of the Electrical Group, Wu Tongzhao of the People's Livelihood Chemical Group, Wang Liang of the Management Group, Su Xianjie of the Textile Group, and Lu Yuanyong of the Oil Refining Group respectively reported on the internship experiences of their respective groups. The following are excerpts of the major points: Advantages of American Factories: (1) Detailed division of labor, close cooperation, flexible organization, and easy coordination and application. (2) Personnel system is very regular. (3) Production control is very perfect. (4) Management technology has a long history. (5) Production costs are highly concerned. (6) Wages are very low, for example, cotton textile workers earn 70 cents per hour, and their lives are very stable. (7) Workers' education and knowledge are improving day by day. In addition to the above advantages, the members felt that there were some large factories that were reluctant to disclose information due to the nature of their products and foreign trade relations. It is hoped that in the future, when the government sends personnel abroad to study, all aspects should be coordinated and complete.

[Another News] Minister Wang and Vice Minister Pan, among others, are scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning.

### The Alarm Rang for a Long Time: Citizens Were Startled: It Turned Out the Wire Was Broken

[Our Report] At 6:45 PM yesterday, the alarms in the Taishan and Huangpu districts of the city suddenly rang for a continuous ten minutes. The general public had not heard this mournful sound for a long time, and its sudden arrival startled everyone. At that time, a civilian airliner happened to fly over the city, making nervous people even more imaginative. Later, the police station notified Xinhua Merchant Bank to investigate the cause. It was reported that underground wire No. 108 in the Jiangxi Road area was damaged due to accumulated water and humidity, causing the alarms in the two districts to ring on their own. Personnel were immediately dispatched to repair it.

### Pan Gongzhan, Li Shizeng, and Others Jointly Petition to Designate August 8th as Father's Day; All Children Should Wear Red and White Flowers on This Day in Remembrance

The establishment of Father's Day in China truly began on August 8th of last year, initiated by ten Shanghai leaders: Yan Huiqing, Yuan Xilian, Shi Zhifu, Mei Lanfang, Fei Mu, Zhang Yiqu, Chen Qingshi, Lu Ganchen, Yan Duhhe, and Fu Wenshou. At that time, it was during the final battle of the Far East, with the enemy rampant and the environment perilous. Their resolute initiative to establish Father's Day was, in reality, an implicit commemoration of the motherland. People in Shanghai responded unanimously, holding enthusiastic celebrations that were deeply inspiring. Recently, ten prominent figures from various circles, including Pan Gongzhan, Li Shizeng, Song Hanzhang, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Zhihui, Li Denghui, and Qian Yongming, felt that this initiative represented a pure expression of national righteousness during the war of resistance and deserved to be widely promoted. Furthermore, just as the United States initiated Mother's Day after World War I, our country initiated Father's Day after World War II. This parallel brilliance, especially at a time of amicable Sino-American relations, felt deeply meaningful. Therefore, based on the original proposal, they jointly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to forward the request to the central government, seeking approval to designate August 8th as Father's Day and issue a nationwide circular for its implementation. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau issued a response, stating: "Received the petition, approval granted to proceed accordingly, and permission is granted to forward the petition to the Ministry of Social Affairs for nationwide circulation and compliance. Be informed accordingly, this is the order." The original petition is now recorded as follows:

Respectfully submitted: It is hereby noted that ten leaders from various circles in Shanghai, including Yan Huiqing, Yuan Xilian, Shi Zhifu, Mei Lanfang, Fei Mu, Zhang Yiqu, Chen Qingshi, Lu Ganchen, Yan Duhhe, and Fu Wenshou, initiated Father's Day on August 8th of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic (1945) and issued a statement of origin, stating: "Recalling that at the end of the First European War, Ms. Jarvis of the United States initiated Mother's Day, aiming to comfort the mothers of those who died in battle. Subsequently, capable people from countries around the world actively promoted it, transforming it into a commemoration of one's own mother.

Regardless of place, time, or culture, the idea of cherishing one's elders is the same. However, the father gave me life, and the mother nurtured me. Zhang Hengqu inscribed the father's heaven and the mother's earth with gratitude, and Liu Meixiao explored the father's worries and the mother's hardships. Father and mother should be equally esteemed and regarded. Knowing only the father and not the mother goes against the common feelings of humanity. Knowing only the mother and not the father is a truly heartbreaking matter! We, the undersigned, as the Second European War comes to an end, are reminded of this and hereby jointly initiate Father's Day, designating every August 8th for respectful celebrations, also known as the Double Eighth Festival.

The double eighths connected resemble the Chinese character for 'father' (父), and the pronunciation is similar to 'baba' (爸爸), making it easy to remember. The ceremony imitates the precedent of Mother's Day. All children wear flowers in remembrance. Those with living fathers wear a red flower, while those whose fathers have passed away wear a white flower, showing respect and performing rituals to the fullest extent. The love of the red sun will shine forever, and the grief of losing one's protector will preserve the pure family tradition. Who does not have parents? Who does not have children? Hearing of this initiative will surely evoke empathy. It is hoped that social leaders will promote and implement it, from one family to one village, to one county, to one province, to one country, and to the entire world. May the gratitude to one's parents be universally unified. This is what we all earnestly and sincerely wish for." These words have been published in various Shanghai newspapers. However, the enemy publication "New Shenbao" refused to publish them, precisely because the initiation of Father's Day was an expression of national consciousness, and the initiators, such as Yan Huiqing, were all known for their unwavering loyalty. It was natural for them to be suspected by the violent enemy. At that time, the violent enemy occupied Shanghai and spared no effort to numb the national consciousness of the people, using nets and restraints to suppress those with ideals. Even the wise could barely protect themselves. However, the initiators did not avoid the perilous environment and resolutely initiated Father's Day, ostensibly as a way to bless their fathers, but implicitly to commemorate the motherland. Even after the Eastern Territory had fallen, the people still longed for Shu. Even with the Southern Crown unchanged, the three households could still overthrow Qin. Their actions are commendable, and their deeds are praiseworthy. This national righteousness should be exemplified by the nation. Moreover, the red and white flowers used to commemorate Father's Day at that time represented the red and white plum blossoms of the motherland, both as a reminder of the concept of the motherland and to strengthen the spirit of perseverance in adversity. At that time, the initiators also donated over 20 million yuan to help with loan funds for primary and secondary schools. This was intended to revive education in the motherland and cultivate national seedlings. Based on these two facts, it is even more evident that the initiation of Father's Day was purely a genuine expression of national self-awareness during the war of resistance, which is perfectly compatible with the Mother's Day initiated by the United States after the First European War and shines with mutual brilliance. For the sake of commemorating the historical traces of the war of resistance and for the sake of promoting national morality, the central government should issue an explicit decree to designate it as a permanent festival. Therefore, we now jointly petition your bureau to review and promptly forward the request to the central government, granting approval to designate August 8th as Father's Day and issue a nationwide circular for its uniform implementation. This would be a truly virtuous deed. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Petitioners: Pan Gongzhan, Li Shizeng, Song Hanzhang, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Jingheng, Li Denghui, Qian Yongming.

### He Dequi Flies Back from Beijing; Government to Send Personnel to Shanghai for Investigation

### Three Heads of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Answer Reporters' Questions; Current Economic Measures Aim to Resolve Difficulties for Factories in the Rear; Enemy-Puppet Factories Will be Transferred to Private Operation

Minister Wang, Vice Minister Xiao, and Vice Minister Pan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs met with reporters yesterday to answer questions about current economic measures: (Question) Representatives of factories in the rear have petitioned in Beijing, proposing a "Plan for the Resumption of Work at Enemy-Puppet Factories," hoping to be treated favorably through joint ventures or delegated management. What is the Ministry's response? (Answer) The Ministry attaches great importance to factories in the rear that have made special contributions. As for what method will be adopted to solve the current difficulties of each factory, we are currently exchanging opinions with all parties. (Question) It is rumored that the government has decided to allocate thirteen of the enemy-puppet factories taken over in Shanghai to factories in the rear, giving them priority in purchasing them. Is this true? (Answer) This is being handled by the Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property. Detailed procedures have not yet been learned, but the number of factories that will be sold to private factories in the rear will be more than this number. (Question) It was originally stipulated that the textile industry would be transferred to private operation in two or three years. What method will be adopted in the future? Will the China Textile Company also be subject to this principle and be transferred to private operation on a fixed schedule? (Answer) The government's takeover of enemy-puppet factories for resumption of work through state-owned operation is temporary in nature. When production is back on track, they will be immediately transferred to private operation. The China Textile Construction Company is also included in this. When it is transferred to private operation in the future, it may adopt a company organizational method, selling stocks and allowing the people to invest and take over. (Question) More than one-third of the spindles in the country use American cotton as raw material. How will the sales of domestic cotton be remedied? (Answer) The Ministry attaches great importance to promoting domestic cotton. Where domestic cotton can be used, we will try to use it as much as possible. However, due to current transportation difficulties, factories have no choice but to replace it with American cotton. (Question) The factories under the Ministry of Economic Affairs that have resumed work are currently headed by factory directors who are responsible for their management. Will this system be maintained for a long time? (Answer) The factory directors were temporarily dispatched to take charge of the factories for the needs of resumption of work. After the factories have been reorganized, separate handling methods will be formulated. (Question) The factories under the Ministry of Economic Affairs that have resumed work are experiencing great difficulties in the turnover of funds. Are there any remedial measures? (Answer) The government has no budgetary funds to allocate to the factories that have resumed work. In principle, we hope that each factory can maintain production with its products. No other measures are currently being considered. (Question) The prices of domestic manufactured products are several times higher than those of similar products abroad. Has the government considered remedial measures? (Answer) This issue is very broad and cannot be answered in a few words. However, most of it is still affected by the exchange rate. (Question) What is the situation regarding the government's review of the takeover and handling of factories across the country? (Answer) Regarding the technical aspects of the takeover, because it involves various parties and is more complicated, it is not easy to make a judgment immediately. However, we are constantly investigating and improving it.

### Over Fifty Banned Radio Stations to Send Representatives to Beijing to Request the Ministry of Communications to Conduct a General Review

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications recently stated that there are many radio stations in the city and the radio waves are mixed. As a result of the investigation by the personnel sent, it was announced that the qualified ones were: Cooperation, Jindu, Asia, China Free, Ninety-Nine, and Minsheng, a total of six stations. The ones ordered to modify and re-examine were: New Voice, Datong, Greater China, Union, Chinese Culture, and Jiancheng, a total of six stations. One public radio station. Fifty-four stations, including Triumph Radio Station, were listed in the scope of being banned. For a time, the banned radio stations were in a state of panic. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, they hosted reporters from various newspapers on the fourteenth floor of the International Hotel. Zhu Wenhao from Jiancheng Radio Station reported, roughly stating: After the victory, the establishment of radio stations had been filed with the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Central Broadcasting Affairs Bureau. The investigators sent by the Telecommunications Bureau recently did not fully fulfill their responsibilities when they set out to investigate. Moreover, the authorities have no follow-up measures for the banned radio stations. For example, the radio station equipment is left unused, and it is susceptible to moisture, mold, and damage. For these reasons, it is planned to send representatives to Beijing to petition and request four points: (1) Request the Ministry of Communications to select competent personnel to come to Shanghai to conduct a general review. (2) Request the Ministry of Communications to increase the weekly rate or allow the same industry to operate jointly for relief. (3) Before the request is resolved, permission is granted to continue broadcasting as usual. (4) After the review, if it is determined that there is indeed non-compliance with the regulations, the government should fund the purchase or order the relocation to the mainland for establishment.

### Solving the City's Traffic Problems Requires Development in the Air and Underground

[Our Dispatch] According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Works Bureau: Shanghai's traffic congestion is an inevitable phenomenon, because the traffic in lively cities in Europe has progressed to three-dimensionality. At present, the methods used in this city to improve traffic are all temporary remedies. To seek a thorough solution, the traffic problem must be developed "in the air" and "underground." The Public Works Bureau is currently petitioning the Public Works Bureau to study the building drawings of the former Public Works Bureau to explore whether the piles and drainage devices under the city's surface are suitable for opening underground passages. However, Zhao believes that this proposal is premature until the economic problem is solved.

The Public Works Bureau will also suggest to the Public Works Bureau that future construction of high-rise buildings must be equipped with parking spaces to avoid vehicles from parking on the roadside and obstructing traffic in the city.

Special Article

### Introducing the New Qun Middle School in Hangzhou, Returning Victorious, Continuing the Songs, Studying Well in the Scenery

"The plum rain season opens with rain in every household." In this first summer vacation after the victory, young students are all preparing to go home with a light heart to enjoy this long summer. However, graduating students may feel somewhat apprehensive about the issue of further education. Which school should they go to? Here, the author would like to give readers a brief report on the New Qun Senior Middle School, which will resume classes in Hangzhou this autumn.

A Brief History of the Founding

New Qun Senior High School was founded in 1940. At that time, the flames of war had severely impacted the original middle schools in western Zhejiang, making it difficult to fully restore them for a time. However, young people in the occupied areas, with enthusiastic hearts, came to the interior but had no place to study. Mr. Ruan Yicheng, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department, and others then initiated the establishment of New Qun Senior High School. After several plans, classes officially began in the autumn of that year in Shishi, Yongkang, the temporary provincial capital of Zhejiang at the time. After the opening of this middle school, it provided special relief to students from the occupied areas, and the teaching was also very conscientious, so it gained a good reputation in society. By the summer of 1942, there were six grades and more than 300 students. Unfortunately, the war situation changed rapidly that year, and many places in eastern Zhejiang were devastated. New Qun moved six hundred miles in one month, and the difficulties encountered along the way were beyond description. All equipment, except for books, was completely lost, so classes were temporarily suspended. The original students were introduced separately and transferred to provincial schools to continue their studies.

The Process of Resuming School

After the victory of the War of Resistance last year, the New Qun School Board sent personnel to Hangzhou to prepare for the resumption of school, temporarily borrowing No. 7 Leifeng Pagoda as the school building. Leifeng Pagoda is one of the famous scenic spots in Hangzhou, facing the lake and backing the mountain, with beautiful scenery. It is only three li away from the lakeside, and both water and land transportation can reach it directly. Moreover, "the ruins of Leifeng are still visible, the sound of the Southern Bell is endless, and the flowers and trees are lush, and the garden is wide," making it a good place to study. The original houses, having been stationed by enemy and puppet troops, were mostly damaged. The School Board allocated huge sums of money to repair them, and they have generally been restored to their original appearance. The library currently has 15,000 volumes, and it is still being actively purchased from various sources. Physical, chemical, and biological instruments and specimens have been ordered from the United States according to the equipment standards of American secondary schools. It is estimated that more than 16 million yuan has been paid, and they can be shipped to Shanghai around the end of October this year.

Enrollment Steps

The school has now been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education to resume classes starting this autumn. Mr. Zhu Yiqing has been appointed as principal. Mr. Zhu has served in the education sector for more than 20 years and was originally the principal of Wenzhou Middle School in Zhejiang Province. He was recently granted permission to resign in order to take over as the head of New Qun. Regarding the faculty, the appointed include Cui Dongbo, the former principal of Hangzhou High School in Zhejiang Province, and Pan Xijiu, the former principal of Shaoxing Middle School in Zhejiang Province, all of whom are well-known figures in the Zhejiang education sector. In the future, the academic standards and the style of learning will certainly be able to get a satisfactory answer, and answer the enthusiastic expectations of the social people. It is heard that the school will enroll four classes (200 students) of first-year high school students next semester, with entrance examinations to be held in Hangzhou around mid-August. Students from Shanghai or other places who come to Hangzhou to take the examination can ask the school to temporarily arrange accommodation. Detailed enrollment information is sent by Mr. Lin Renzhe of the school at No. 7 Leifeng Pagoda, Hangzhou, and anyone can request it by letter.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Personnel Who Participated in the War of Resistance and Were Dismissed Should Be Given Priority in Employment by Various Agencies

Yesterday, the Municipal Government received a directive from the Executive Yuan approving a public letter from the Control Yuan, stating that, according to a report by Control Committee Member Li Xiaoting, the former Central Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for Refugees had registered dismissed civil servants returning to their hometowns. Recently, many of the personnel who have come from various directions are mostly scantily clad, suffering from exposure and wind, and wandering without recourse. The voices of complaint are loud, and many think of taking risks. At a time when the country urgently needs construction and people are urgently needed, it is regrettable to leave those who participated in the War of Resistance, faced difficulties, and were loyal to the country idle. Therefore, it is suggested to forward it to the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan, respectively ordering the recovered areas, provincial, municipal, and county governments, and security police bureaus to give priority to employing personnel who participated in the War of Resistance and were dismissed, allowing them to hold certificates or letters from superiors to apply for employment at the local agencies, which should immediately employ them according to their level, and not refuse or reject them, in order to encourage loyalty and quell disturbances. The letter requested verification and handling, which was approved. In addition to distribution, the order was issued to be followed and forwarded for compliance. It is now learned that the Municipal Government has issued an order to its subordinate agencies to comply.

### Academic Qualifications from Unregistered Schools

Treated as Non-School Backgrounds

The Ministry of Interior approved a letter from the Fujian Provincial Government, stating that civil servants applying to change their names or surnames, or to add a surname, should be handled in accordance with the regulations on the review of name changes and surname additions and additions of the Ministry of Interior, Article 12. However, how should it be handled if the person is not from a school, or the original school has been closed for a long time, and the local educational administrative agency has no record to verify and does not provide proof? It is approved to investigate that the academic qualifications referred to in Article 12 of the regulations on the review of name changes and surname additions and additions of the Ministry of Interior refer to schools that have been registered by the Ministry of Education or local educational administrative agencies. If the original school has been closed for a long time, and the local educational administrative agency has no record to verify and does not provide proof, it is naturally an unregistered school. This type of academic qualification is the same as a non-school background and should be handled according to the general procedures for people to apply, and is not restricted by the provisions of that article.

### Government Agencies at All Levels in Need of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate

Should Participate in Bidding and Report to the Executive Yuan

Yesterday, the Municipal Government received an instruction from the Executive Yuan: Enemy and puppet houses and land should be sold by auction in accordance with regulations, and people and business groups should be given priority to purchase them in order to enrich the national treasury. Government agencies at all levels in need of houses and land should follow the general practice. Requests to allocate these houses and land are not in accordance with regulations. However, at a time when the housing shortage is serious, the lack of offices for government agencies will affect the implementation of public affairs. It should be handled flexibly. In the future, if government agencies urgently need to allocate enemy and puppet real estate, they should still participate in the bidding at the local enemy and puppet property disposal agency in accordance with regulations. The bidding agency should present the proportional bid price to the Executive Yuan for approval. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government has issued an order to its subordinate agencies to comply.

### Elections in the Thirty-Second District

### Foreign Goods Pouring In, Fuel Shortage, Cement Industry in Jeopardy, Imported Cement Sold for Only 5,000 Yuan Per Bag, Coal Inventory Dwindling, Few Coal Allocations

[Our Newspaper Report] Under the dumping of foreign cement, the domestic cement industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. According to reliable statistics from the customs, from January to June of this year, imports of foreign cement reached more than 500,000 bags. With a market price of 5,000 yuan per bag of 50 kilograms, the outflow of funds in half a year reached 250 billion yuan. Shanghai Cement Company, China Cement Company, Zhe新 Cement Company, and Taiwan Cement Company recently established by the Resources Committee have organized the China Cement Industry Federation to discuss solutions in order to save the current crisis. Yesterday, Mr. Xi Zhengxiu, secretary of the federation, told reporters that the first step is to request the government to increase the import tax on foreign cement. Currently, the production cost of domestic cement is more than 9,000 yuan per bag of more than 60 kilograms due to the high cost of wages, raw materials, fuel, and transportation. However, the market price of foreign goods is only 5,000 yuan per bag of 50 kilograms. In order to recover national interests, they have to sell it at a price of 6,000 yuan per bag, but how can they bear the loss in the long run? They will be forced to stop work one day. Now that the cost side cannot be reduced due to various factors, they can only hope that the government will increase import tariffs to seek remedy. Secondly, cement is a very necessary material for national defense and construction. Before the war, my country's cement industry had excellent achievements, such as the Elephant brand of Shanghai Yongni Company, the Taishan brand of China Cement Company, and the Horse brand of Qixin Company. Their quality even surpassed foreign goods, so all sectors of the country were very happy to use them. However, since the victory, the trend of blindly believing in foreign goods has become stronger, and even government agencies are doing so, which is extremely painful. Therefore, it is planned to request the government to find ways to encourage the people to use domestic goods. Furthermore, the source of fuel coal is extremely difficult. Taking Shanghai Cement Company as an example, it needs about 4,000 tons of coal per month, but the Fuel Allocation Committee can only supply about 100 tons. What it currently relies on to maintain is the coal left by the Japanese after the reception, but it is about to run out, so this point also needs to be urgently resolved.

### The Farmers Still Hold a Lot of Silk Cocoons; Failure to Purchase Them Soon Will Affect the Autumn Cocoons

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper visited a responsible person from the China Silk Company to inquire about the company's stance on China's silk industry. According to this person, the company hopes to provide a comprehensive solution for the Chinese silk industry. Regarding manufacturers, they hope to raise silk prices, maintain manufacturers' costs, and provide them with a small profit, so that the silk industry can be sustained. At the same time, the interests of silkworm farmers should be guaranteed. For example, there are still three to four thousand *dan* of silk cocoons held by various silkworm farmers. It is hoped that manufacturers will purchase them, so that the farmers will still have the interest to raise autumn silkworms. Regarding price, the production costs of silkworm farmers should be maintained and reasonable profits should be given. Ultimately, it is hoped that both government and the people can thoroughly improve China's silk industry, reduce production costs, increase production volume, and ensure a large quantity of uniform quality, so that the Chinese silk industry can be expected to recover. The responsible person concluded by saying: I deeply hope that after receiving government relief, manufacturers will not abandon the silk industry due to temporary low profits, but should maintain the spirit of persistent efforts, strive hard, and overcome this difficult stage, so that there is hope for a bright future.

### Statistics on Financial Institutions in Seven Major Cities Nationwide: Total of 912

According to the latest statistics released by the Central Bank, there are a total of 912 financial institutions in the seven major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Chongqing, and Guangzhou. Specifically, Shanghai has 359, Tianjin 105, Nanjing 52, Beiping 48, Guangzhou 13, Hankou 84, and Chongqing 251. These figures include all financial institutions in these areas, such as state-owned, provincial, municipal, and private banks, as well as silver shops, native banks, trust companies, insurance companies, and cooperative treasuries.

### Curbing Hoarding by Banks and Native Banks

The Ministry of Finance Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Account Books. Due to the abundance of floating capital in this city, many banks and native banks are using this capital to buy up goods. Some are also using investment in factories as a pretext to hoard goods, which is greatly stimulating prices. To prevent this from happening, the financial authorities have not only issued strict orders to prohibit this, but have also dispatched personnel to investigate the transaction records of various banks and native banks. Anyone found to have committed the above-mentioned acts will be severely punished.

### Imbalance in Silk Supply and Demand; Uniformly Weak Market Conditions

Last week, rayon 120 from the Tianqiao brand was priced at 1.7 million yuan. Subsequently, due to the imbalance in supply and demand, the market price gradually declined. By the end of the week, the transaction price was 1.61 million yuan, a total decrease of 100,000 yuan. The 120 brand of bright yarn from miscellaneous factories was still selling well, so the price was more stable than Tianqiao. For example, Jin Sanma was priced at 1.63 million yuan on Monday and 1.57 million yuan at the end of the week, a decrease of 60,000 yuan. The 75 semi-matte yarn was selling very well in Hangzhou, with a shortage of 40,000 yuan last week. Factory-reeled silk was also weak. Grade 81 high uniformity was priced at 2.4 million yuan at the beginning of the week and 2.35 million yuan at the end of the week. Grade 78 was priced at 2.25 million yuan at the beginning of the week and 2.2 million yuan at the end of the week. The price of silk for ordinary users decreased by about 50,000 yuan during the week. Dried reeled silk received little attention, with a decrease of 100,000 yuan compared to the beginning of last week. The price of Meiya silk damask for quilt covers was generally between 1.43 and 1.44 million yuan at the beginning of last week, but decreased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan each day from Thursday, for a total decrease of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Dacheng checkered crepe has been phased out and very little trading is taking place. The price decreased by more than 200 yuan starting from Thursday last week. However, Huajin crepe, purchased by customers, sold particularly well. The highest price on Wednesday was 2.15 million yuan, but due to the abundance of spot goods and uneven quality, the price returned to 2 million yuan.

### Shanghai-Taiwan Shipping Costs Reduced to 48,000 Yuan per Ton

Trade between Shanghai and Taiwan is gradually flourishing. The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently adjusted the shipping costs for its vessels sailing between Shanghai and Keelung, Taiwan, and implemented a reduction starting yesterday. The original shipping cost was 72,000 yuan per ton, which has now been reduced to 48,000 yuan per ton. A general flat rate is charged for all kinds of goods, regardless of whether they are valuable items such as ginseng and woolen cloth, or ordinary items such as fertilizer and soybean cakes.

### Tungsten Ore Exports Begin; A Glimpse into Import-Export Merchants' Goods

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Zhongkai wheel is scheduled to sail directly to Guangdong yesterday, fully loaded with cotton yarn, totaling more than 6,400 bales. Tungsten ore exports have begun. The Aeteward, managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., left Shanghai the day before yesterday and returned to Vancouver, carrying 100 tons of tungsten ore to Australia. In addition, the Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company's Hanyang wheel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, bringing more than 5,000 pieces of bananas and 7,000 pieces of general merchandise, as well as 1,500 tons of cotton, which is scheduled to be transported to Qingdao and Tianjin by the same vessel at noon today. It is reported that the cotton is relief goods. The Gordon, managed by the Runde President Lines, left Shanghai yesterday for Bombay, carrying more than 1,500 bales of factory-reeled silk from this city.

### Hardware Transactions Dull

Transactions of steel plates were average last week. Pipes remained strong. Due to Nanjing merchants' procurement, man-made fiber and gauze prices were raised by 10-20%. As the season is about to end, many users are releasing green iron wire mesh, but buyers are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a drop of 30,000-40,000 yuan. The second batch of files has been decided and will be transported soon, but only by five or six major companies, so prices are not expected to collapse. Due to competitive bidding, there is not much dog-brand door locks currently in stock.

### U.S. Lacks Cast Iron; Automobile Production Will Be Reduced

[United Press, Washington, 27th] The Civilian Production Administration announced today that automobile production may decline within the next three months due to a shortage of raw materials and parts. It is said that the main reason for the decline is a severe shortage of cast iron. In August and September, the Bureau will give priority to the allocation of cast iron to producers of agricultural machinery and housing materials, at which time the reduction in automobile production will be even more acute.

### Investigation of New Enterprises in Shanghai

New China Scientific Instruments Manufacturing Factory, Co., Ltd., with a capital of 50 million yuan, has been approved for establishment by the Social Affairs Bureau and started operations at the beginning of this month. It specializes in the manufacture of scientific instruments, focusing on models of animals, plants and pathology, and also produces advertising tools, etc. The chairman is Chen Caifu, the general manager is Li Xianying, and the assistant managers are Zhou Huachen and Ding Peiqiang.

### Grey Serge Revived

White Serge Declines Alone

White serge has recently declined, and there are no accurate price quotes at tea parties. The supply and demand for raw serge is low, and because it is not a popular item, its price is often below that of other colors. Navy blue serge, regardless of thickness, sells well in all seasons. During the peak period of customer purchases, the market price rose sharply, and most are on par with grass green. Grass green serge is essential for military and government circles, and sales have been even smoother after the victory. Purchases from all over are extremely popular, and the production and inventory in Shanghai are scarce. The genuinely domestically produced Yinfeng and Zhanghua brands are particularly profitable. Recently, actual sales have gradually increased, and it is also the time when China Textile Corporation has no shipments, and the auction of enemy property inventories is about to end. The market sentiment for grass green and navy blue thick, all-wool serge is even stronger. Grey serge, which was popular more than ten years ago, has now been revived, and its price is higher than all other colors of serge, which also shows that things reach their extreme and then return, and that scarce goods are valuable.

### Company Managers Must Register Within a Time Limit

Failure to Comply Will Result in Legal Action

Regarding the registration of company managers, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to notify members of various trade associations through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to register in accordance with the law before the end of this year. Those who have previously appointed managers but have not yet registered must be ordered to apply for registration retroactively. Those who appoint managers in the future must report and register in a timely manner in accordance with the law. Failure to comply will be handled in accordance with Article 352, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law, and will still be ordered to register and report the handling situation for verification.

### "Underground Banks" in the Beijing-Shanghai Area Secretly Engage in Illegal Discounting

A large number of banks and native banks that were active during the enemy and puppet period and have not been approved for registration by the Ministry of Finance have emerged in the form of "underground banks" since they were ordered to suspend operations and liquidate. They secretly engage in illegal discounting, fueling usury, causing legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises to be unable to bear the pressure of high interest rates. The financial authorities have taken steps to crack down on them. According to reporters, these "underground banks" are scattered throughout the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai line and in this city, and there are many of them. However, it is quite difficult to eliminate them thoroughly, because their discounting deducts interest first, leaving no traces on the bills. Moreover, they often have no public fixed offices, but conduct private transactions based solely on personal friendships. Furthermore, according to reliable information obtained by reporters, these "underground banks" suffered heavy losses in the recent collapse of the national public debt, estimating losses of at least 5 billion yuan or more. The disputes over returned checks have not yet been fully resolved.

### How to Eliminate Usury?

— Shuang Hong

Indeed, usury, which promotes speculation and disrupts finance, has become the most widespread and uncontrollable serious problem today! The media has repeatedly published righteous and stern articles criticizing it, and the financial authorities have also paid close attention, investigating and banning so-called "underground banks" and "discounting companies." But usury has not been eliminated!

Is usury really impossible to eliminate? Not necessarily. But if we comprehensively review the actual economic conditions of industries and businesses in various regions and the local financial institutions, we can see that if we want to defeat usury, it will not be effective to use methods of investigation or banning. We need to study how to use other methods to make this usury disappear naturally.

Before discussing how to eliminate usury, we must first study how this usury has become so widespread as to create today's situation.

The so-called usury in the past was lending at exorbitant interest rates, and most of the people who borrowed this money were poor people who had nothing to pawn. Only then did they engage in this act of drinking poison to quench their thirst. Ordinary factories and shops had banks and native banks to deal with, and absolutely did not need to borrow money at exorbitant interest rates. Conversely, people who lent money at exorbitant interest rates certainly did not have such large assets to supply the widespread industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, the so-called usury of the past—exorbitant interest rates—was only a small corner of the darkest bottom of society, and would certainly not affect or promote speculation and disrupt finance.

Since the fall of China to the enemy, due to the rampant issuance of counterfeit currency day by day, prices have been soaring madly day by day. The mentality of the general public is that hoarding goods is the only way to get rich, so they borrowed money at high interest rates to hoard goods at any cost. Naturally, supply meets demand. Banks and native banks claimed that funds were tight and raised interest rates day by day, resulting in usury even higher than exorbitant interest rates. But the result was really wronged. During the eight years of enemy occupation, compared to the people hoarding goods, it is said that the people lending money at high interest rates suffered heavy losses.

Since the victory, everyone thought that everything had changed, and that there would be no such strange phenomenon. Who knew that the first event in life was two hundred being treated as one, followed by the closure and liquidation of all banks and native banks in the recovered areas. They were neither allowed to resume operations nor allowed to establish new ones.

The result of two hundred being treated as one was a clearly visible, widespread stimulus to rising prices. Thus, the merchants and hoarders still could not forget hoarding goods, and they still borrowed money at high interest rates to hoard goods at any cost.

After all the banks and native banks in the recovered areas were closed, many practitioners had no way out, so they pooled a small amount of capital and lent money at high interest rates. This is also one of the reasons. But the biggest problem is that national banks cannot universally regulate industry and commerce. Small factories and shops feel that they have no access to temporary small loans for financial turnover. Besides temporarily borrowing from so-called discounting companies, they have no way to obtain loans!

On the other hand, the deposit interest rates of provincial, municipal, and county banks are too low. If someone believes in legal tender and regularly avoids speculation and hoarding goods, depositing cash in a bank to receive weekly interest rates of several fractions of a percent or one percent per week, they are certainly not such naive birds under the current standard of living. Because of this reason, whether it is public officials, shop clerks, or even women, they all know one way out: if they do not hoard goods, then all surplus funds can only be deposited in discounting companies to receive high interest rates. This has invisibly increased the strength of discounting companies.

The reason why usury has caused such a widespread situation today is nothing more than the above-mentioned reasons. Based on these reasons, we can easily obtain methods to eliminate usury.

(1) Strictly prevent bureaucratic capital from rushing into the ranks of unscrupulous merchants to speculate and manipulate. (2) Effectively suppress prices. (3) Increase bank deposit interest rates. (4) Quickly open up the establishment of new banks and native banks in various regions.

In short, usury is certainly not a one-sided affair. Lending begins with borrowing. If there is no need, then usury has no use. Points (1) and (2) are related. Without bureaucratic capital meddling in it, we believe that suppressing prices is easily effective. After prices stabilize, who would be willing to hoard goods, let alone borrow money at high interest rates to hoard goods? (3) Increasing bank deposit interest rates can bring floating capital into the right track and reduce speculation, and at least prevent ordinary clerks and women from blindly depositing into discounting companies. (4) If various regions open up the establishment of new banks and native banks, so that the general industrial and commercial sectors can universally obtain financial regulation, then who would be willing to borrow money at high interest rates from discounting companies?

The event of two hundred being treated as one has already passed. We hope that the financial authorities will quickly do things that can still be saved! Do not continue to keep the doors of new banks and native banks tightly closed, forcing industries and businesses to have no way to obtain loans and forcing them to borrow money at high interest rates from discounting companies. The current general situation can be said that the authority of financial activities in the provinces, cities, counties, and towns, except for Shanghai, is actually in the hands of discounting companies. This is not an exaggeration on my part. The general facts are like this. I hope that the financial authorities will no longer use official language and merely investigate or ban them, which can be said to be completely ineffective in reality. We urgently hope that the financial authorities will adopt our opinions, not to say things like "Why don't they eat meat porridge?" which are irrelevant and miss the point, but to come to the ground and observe the needs of the people's industry and commerce. Truly save the weak industries and businesses! This is the fundamental solution to eliminate usury.

### "White Elephant Country" A Scene of Storm: The Sudden Death of the King of Siam Before and After

— Special Dispatch from Bangkok, November 11th, from Jie Sun

Ever since Luang Phibunsongkhram (i.e., Nai Biri) resumed the position of Prime Minister of Siam, people have been apprehensive that the forces of dictatorial politics will be revived. In the general election of the National Assembly, the Democratic Party led by Seni Pramoj and Nai Khuang Apaiwongse declared defeat. Luang Phibunsongkhram's Constitutional Party was victorious, and almost all the figures from the Luang Phibunsongkhram era have returned to the political stage, making the dictatorial atmosphere even stronger. King Rama VIII, Mahidol Adulyadej (i.e., Ananda Mahidol), studied in Europe from a young age and was influenced by European and American thought. After returning to his country, he often interacted with Seni Pramoj and Nai Khuang, expressing goodwill towards China and the United States, which made him a target of the dictator's early suspicion. His sudden death this time has attracted worldwide attention, and the Siamese people, in particular, have many doubts. Members of the National Assembly have also repeatedly raised questions. A considerable number of people and members of the Assembly have been arrested as a result. Although the Luang Phibunsongkhram government has tried to cover up the truth in various ways and appointed Luang Arrun as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army for suppression.

According to general public discussion, almost all do not believe that the late King's death was accidental. The more outspoken Siamese newspapers, in addition to listing facts to refute the authorities' statement, also determined that the late King was indeed assassinated. Under the strong pressure of public opinion, Luang Phibunsongkhram had no choice but to comply with public sentiment and set up a special investigation committee to investigate this unprecedented case.

The Late King's Nanny Relates the Tragic Story

In addition to publicly summoning palace attendants who were close to the late King, a small committee was also established, inviting domestic, British, and American doctors to conduct an autopsy and experiment with shooting corpses in the head at Surithao Hospital in order to verify the gunshot wounds. According to the late King's nanny, Mae Nang, she is now sixty years old. She studied at the same school as the current Queen Mother in the past, and their relationship was harmonious when she served as a nurse. She often accompanied the King's father abroad. The late King was born in Germany and later moved to Paris when he was only three months old, and then moved to the United States again. The current King Bhumibol was born in the United States. The King's father was irritable and easily angered, and would occasionally try to harm himself over minor matters, such as jumping into rivers or off buildings. The late King's personality was exactly the opposite of his father: he was quiet and taciturn, and did not express his feelings, even if he was touched. Occasionally, he would become depressed and unhappy due to stimulation, but this was not common. According to daily habits, she would wait until the late King, the current King, and the Queen Mother had entered his bedroom before she went downstairs to rest in her bedroom. The night before the incident occurred, she did not notice any signs of difference, and the late King was no different from usual. At about 7:00 AM the next morning, she went upstairs as usual to serve the Queen Mother. After arriving upstairs, she saw that the Queen Mother and the current King were already up. Since there was nothing else to do, she went to visit the late King. At this time, she suddenly heard a gunshot. She was panicked and did not know what to do and heard a cry of "Ah, Mama..." When she entered the bedroom, the Queen Mother and the current King had already entered. The Queen Mother was embracing the late King in bed, and the current King was standing in front of the bed, embracing the Queen Mother. Both mother and son were crying, and the situation was very tragic. The late King was lying on his back, in a posture like someone sleeping soundly. Blood was flowing from his forehead, and a pistol was placed between the late King's left elbow. According to her, the late King's pulse was very weak, but his whole body was still warm. The late King often consulted her on matters after returning to the country, because he regarded her as his closest relative. On one occasion, he expressed to her how to enable the people to live in peace, which also shows the late King's concern for the suffering of the people. The late King was a wise ruler, who knew right from wrong, and was rich in moral concepts.

Twenty Famous Doctors Specializing in Autopsy Work

As for the autopsy of the late King's body, it was carried out by twenty famous doctors. The first step was to take an X-ray of the head, then open the skull, insert an iron bar from the wound on the forehead, pierce through the skull at the back of the head, making an oblique straight line, and then take an X-ray. Next, a square of skin was cut out from the wound on the forehead for examination. Another incision was made in the abdomen, and the stomach and large intestine were taken out and sent to the chemical laboratory for testing, and the results showed that there were no toxins present. A total of seven dead human heads were used for shooting experiments at Surithao Hospital. Six heads were shot in the forehead with pistols at varying distances, and only one was shot from the back of the head. All heads were X-rayed after being shot for record-keeping. After careful examination and experimentation, the participating doctors immediately convened a meeting to discuss their findings. The meeting stipulated that the three principles set by the police should be used as the criteria for discussion. The three principles are: (1) Accident, (2) Suicide, (3) Murder.

No Stimulation Before the Sudden Death

After the meeting began, the doctors specializing in psychology announced their opinions. According to them, after careful examination and experimentation, including an on-the-spot inspection of the late King's bedroom, there was absolutely no reason to believe that the late King had committed suicide. In addition, it was also investigated that the late King had not been subjected to any stimulation during his lifetime, especially on the night before the incident. There was no conflict of opinion with the Queen Mother and the King's brother. Even the closest nanny did not see any signs of unhappiness or displeasure on the late King's face. He only spoke of how to find a way to enable the people to live and work in peace.

Bone Expert Verifies Shooting Situation

According to the bone experts, the fracture and penetration of the skull was caused by a bullet shot at close range. The bullet passed through very quickly, and the explosive force of the bullet resulted in cracks in the skull. According to the reports of X-ray and microscopic experts, after careful examination of the square skin cut from the forehead, the wound was found to be concave and round, which was due to the pressure of the gun barrel. A 11 mm caliber pistol was then placed on the skin of the wound, which fit perfectly. Gunpowder was also found around the depression, which fully proved that the bullet entered from the forehead and exited from the lower end of the skull at the back of the head. It was observed that the shot was fired at the head of the bed, and the bullet penetrated the skull at the back of the head. When the head of the corpse was examined again, the path of the bullet shot in the forehead was straight, which means that the bullet entered from the forehead and exited from the upper end of the skull at the back of the head. As for the experiment of firing from the back of the head, the wound on the forehead where the bullet exited was larger than the entrance wound on the back of the head.

Who is the Murderer? Discussions are Very Diverse

At this point, the meeting unanimously agreed that the late King's death was indeed a murder. It was also unanimously believed that the late King was asleep in bed when he was murdered, and the murderer entered from the head of the bed, placed the gun barrel against the skin of the forehead, and then pulled the trigger. Thus, the death of Ananda Mahidol due to murder has become a definite conclusion, and who the murderer is and why he was murdered can be answered from two perspectives: Some say that it was the reactionary faction in Siam who committed the crime. Because although Ananda Mahidol was young, he was highly educated and had fresh ideas, and was very close to the new faction in the country. This time, he was preparing to go abroad, intending to visit the United States first, instead of going directly to Europe. When his itinerary was decided, Seni Pramoj volunteered to serve as the Siamese representative and go to the United States for assistance because French troops had invaded the border. This coincided with the Siamese King's visit to the United States, and the reactionary faction suspected that it contained political intentions. Another thing that aroused the hatred of the reactionary faction was that before going abroad, he inspected the Chinese business districts and various group organizations, accepted the warm welcome of the Chinese, had dinner with the representatives of the Chinese, and made pro-China remarks.

Complex Case, Said to Have International Background

Some say that the border disputes are serious, and the British troops stationed in Siam are also conducting exercises, simulating the occupation of important areas of Siam and its government agencies, echoing the French troops from afar. Then, a large number of British troops entered southern Siam from Malaya, claiming to suppress bandits. All these series of facts seem to indicate that an international storm is coming to the White Elephant Country on the Golden Peninsula! Under such dangerous circumstances, the sudden death of the king is considered to have an international background, attempting to create internal turmoil in Siam and reap the benefits. For more than a month, Siam has been turbulent. Luang Phibunsongkhram himself also made a statement a few days ago, saying that the previous disturbances were all bloodless, and that judging from the current situation, bloodshed is inevitable.

Overseas Chinese Wipe Tears and Hold Joint Public Memorial

In 1935, Siam underwent a revolution, and the political system changed from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy. King Rama VII fled to England, abdicated, and let his nephew inherit the throne, that is, Ananda Mahidol. In 1938, Ananda Mahidol returned to Siam from Europe and ascended the throne at the age of about thirteen. Soon after, he went to Switzerland to study. During the reign of Luang Phibunsongkhram, the royal family was severely controlled, and its property was even declared confiscated. King Rama VII also died in a foreign land at that time. After the end of this war, Ananda Mahidol returned to his homeland on December 5 last year. He originally planned to stay for a while and then go to Europe, but because the new constitution had not been drafted in time, he delayed his trip until after the signing and promulgation of the constitution before deciding to accept President Truman's invitation to visit the United States. He was deeply dissatisfied with the actions of the Siamese rulers, but because the power was not yet in his hands, he was unable to do anything. When inspecting the Chinese business district, he replied at the welcoming meeting with the sentence "The two nations of China and Siam have had a deep relationship in history, and they must cooperate closely in the future," which gave a very good impression to our overseas Chinese. His tragic death is tantamount to China losing a good friend, and the overseas Chinese are deeply saddened. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Chaozhou, Hainan, Guangzhao, Hakka, Fujian, and Jiangsu-Zhejiang Associations jointly held a public memorial service. The Chaozhou Association's elegiac couplet reads:

"Ascending the throne for more than ten years, Qishan phoenixes sing, the people praise the holy king;

Returning for only half a year, Dinghu dragons leave, Chaozhou overseas Chinese wipe tears and mourn the wise king."

### From the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to the Paris Peace Conference

— Special Correspondent Xue Yan, London Dispatch, November 11th

The ill-fated Paris Peace Conference can finally be convened. During the drafting of the treaty, although most of the difficulties were raised by the Soviet Union, the completion of the current draft treaty is also largely due to the Soviet Union's concessions.

When the four foreign ministers held their second meeting in Paris on June 15, the forms prepared by their representatives listed more than twenty points that the four foreign ministers had agreed to and disagreed with, which was a grand sight. However, the real disputes at the meeting were only three issues in the Italian treaty: (1) Reparations, (2) Italian colonies, and (3) Trieste. Among them, the amount and principles of reparations had already been decided by the four foreign ministers at the first meeting in April, and Italy should pay the Soviet Union 100 million US dollars. This time, the four foreign ministers argued about the source of reparations and the valuation of some of the assets used to offset the reparations. All Italian properties within the Soviet Union, the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, and the Soviet military zone in Germany were all valued and taken over by the Soviet Union to offset the reparations. However, the estimated total value of these properties differed between the American and Soviet experts, so there was some debate on the spot. However, this was ultimately an expert issue that could be studied objectively, and the results were still handed over to the experts for re-evaluation. In addition, some of Italy's military factories and several ships were also handed over to the Soviet Union as reparations. If the number is still less than 100 million US dollars, then the goods produced by Italy in the future will be transported to the Soviet Union and used as a substitute for the price. There was also a dispute over the types of products under the last item and the repayment period, but it was finally decided that payment should begin within three years after the treaty takes effect, and be paid off within six years from the date of first payment. As for the determination of the types, it will be agreed upon by the governments of the Soviet Union and Italy.

### The Depressing North

— Special Correspondent Li Shaolin, Tianjin Dispatch, November 18th

The climate in the north is becoming increasingly hot. Although occasional showers bring some coolness, they are fleeting and cannot relieve the suffocating heat. The current situation is shrouded in haze, with gunfire erupting everywhere, further increasing people's depression. What people are reflecting on is no longer how to seek peace, but just dreaming of when peace can come. Everyone seems to have lost the courage to actively call for peace and has become passively and helplessly waiting.

The peace talks that went directly from Chongqing to Nanjing have evolved from infinite hope to a vague hope. So many people turned their attention to the local and regional negotiations, always hoping that the success of negotiations in one place would bring hope to another place. However, Chen Yi's refusal to go to Qingdao and Lin Biao's postponement of going to Changchun have made the people's hopes come to nothing, and expectations have turned into bubbles. What is left now, besides unparalleled depression, is only blind waiting. The weather is so hot that many people are expecting a downpour. The sky is indeed covered with thick clouds. Will this rain really fall?

The three-day war in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway in the early part of this month was an unprecedented large-scale conflict since the restoration. At that time, the common army's goals were two: one was Qingxian, and the other was Cangxian. In Qingxian, the common army used the 33rd Regiment, 35th Regiment, 63rd Regiment, Baoding Brigade, Xinle Brigade, Jinnan Detachment, field artillery company, and part of the militia. In Cangxian, there were the 24th Regiment, 78th Regiment, 17th Regiment, 18th Regiment, and Cangxian Brigade of the common army, etc., with a total force of about 20,000. At the beginning of the conflict, every important station on the railway line from Tianjin to Cang was attacked and destroyed by the common army. Then, the main force of the common army pointed to Qingxian. This battle lasted for three days and three nights. The common army was repulsed on the 8th, and Qingxian was relieved. As a result, more than 1,500 common army soldiers were annihilated, and the people along the line suffered the most. Who can say that the purpose of the common army was just this? In recent days, the Jinpu and Beijing-Nanjing lines have been generally calm, but listening to Mr. Zhou Enlai's remarks, it seems difficult to guarantee that it will remain so calm.

Gu Zhutong, Xiong Shihui, Zhang Jiaao, Lu Han, and others passed through Tianjin on the afternoon of the 17th and headed north. They stayed at the station for less than a quarter of an hour before hurrying to Ping. Xiong said that this trip did not have any mission, but many people meant that this was not an ordinary trip. If they wanted to prove that they were here for a summer vacation, then the Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, Du, had gone to Beidaihe from Tianjin the day before to prepare their residence for them. However, Gu and others did not stay in Beidaihe. Xiong answered reporters' questions separately in the car. The first question was of course the situation of the conflict in the Northeast. Xiong said that it had been relatively calm recently. When asked why the meeting with Du Lin had not been successful, he said that it was because Lin Biao did not go to Changchun. As for why Lin Biao did not go, he did not know. The reporter had a separate conversation with Zhang Jiaao for a few minutes. Regarding the takeover and reorganization of the Northeast industry and mines, Zhang said that he was gradually expanding and reorganizing. Zhang said that the main problem in the restoration of Northeast industry and mines was electricity. I asked: Do we have the strength to restore the required electricity? Zhang paused slightly and said, "It is always possible."

After the special train left Tianjin, the news reporters immediately received a notice: this news cannot be published, but the next day, all the newspapers in Pingjin published it. After the abolition of news censorship, the press has indeed gained freedom.

Today, observing the overall situation in the north, it is really impossible to see the reason. Because the whole situation is still in chaos. The Tianjin military vehicle authorities have repeatedly and firmly stated that the security of Tianjin is extremely solid. This point has indeed gained the trust of the people. Although the common army's area is only a few dozen miles away, the people's hearts are unusually stable. Starting from the 16th of this month, the Tianjin authorities began to train citizens. At first, it caused some doubts among the citizens. After the authorities positively stated that it was to supplement the shortage of police and engage in local security, people's psychology gradually stabilized.

In a few days, it will be the time when the green gauze tent rises. Whether it can be passed peacefully will be answered by the facts. If the peasants' blood and sweat are cherished, then those crops should no longer be harmed. If our material resources are considered extremely scarce, then it can also be clearly understood that the war of attacking in and retreating is useless. Look at a recent example: in the Qingxian battle, the dozens of common army soldiers captured were about to be incorporated into the local teams. Are these people considered liberators, or are they being liberated? Basically, they don't know what's going on.

### Trieste Issue Establishes Compromise Plan

Trieste has always been one of the international disputes because of the complexity of the ethnic groups of the inhabitants and as a commercial import and export point for the Balkan Peninsula. When the four foreign ministers met for the first time in Paris, every time they talked about Italy's territory in Africa, they always said: "Considering that Italy may lose territory in other areas," they hinted at the Soviet Union's intention to completely separate Trieste from Italy and merge it into Yugoslavia. In fact, the most heatedly debated issue at the second four foreign ministers' conference was the Trieste issue. In the end, it was a great achievement to adopt the compromise plan proposed by France, which can be said to be the greatest achievement of the second four foreign ministers' conference. Now, the agreed draft is translated as follows:

(1) The four foreign ministers agreed to establish the Free Territory of Trieste, the area of which includes the entire territory west of the Duino line and south of Cittanuova, as suggested by France.

(2) The integrity and independence of this free territory shall be guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council.

(3) A special committee shall be organized by representatives appointed by the Security Council (including representatives of the four powers), after consulting the governments of Yugoslavia and Italy, to submit recommendations on the administrative organization of the territory to the twenty-one-nation peace conference.

(4) The regulations of this free territory, after being approved by the Security Council, shall be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 15 of the United Nations Charter.

(5) Recommendations on the establishment of the interim government and permanent regulations of this territory shall be submitted by the twenty-one-nation peace conference.

(6) The establishment of its interim government and permanent regulations shall be in accordance with the following principles:

A. The chief executive of this territory shall be appointed by the Security Council after consulting the representatives of South Italy. B. The legislative and judicial institutions of the interim government shall be established in a democratic manner.

C. The rights enjoyed by its citizens regarding language, religion, newspapers, education, and public service shall be respected.

D. Its chief executive shall submit a report to the Security Council annually.

### Italian Colonies Reach New Agreement

There were also several unexpected developments in dealing with the issue of Italian colonies. The Dodecanese Islands were merged into Greece, and the status of its territory in Africa will remain as it is for the time being, and a final decision will be made in a year. The full text of the agreement is as follows:

(1) Italy renounces all ownership and title to its territory in Africa.

(2) Before a final decision is obtained, the above-mentioned territory shall continue to be governed by the current administrative agencies.

(3) The final disposal of the above-mentioned territory shall be determined by the four powers within one year after the treaty takes effect, in accordance with the principles of the joint declaration issued by the four powers.

The draft of the joint declaration has the following points:

(1) The four powers agree to jointly determine the final disposal of Italian African territory within one year after the Italian treaty takes effect.

(2) When the four powers finally dispose of the above-mentioned territory, they shall make decisions in accordance with one or more of the following resolutions. As for whether it applies to the entire territory or ten parts of it, it shall be decided based on the wishes of the local residents and the opinions of the governments concerned.

A. Independence.

B. Merge into neighboring territory.

C. Trusteeship by the United Nations collectively or by one of the countries.

(3) If the four powers cannot reach an agreement in accordance with the above resolution, they shall submit it to the United Nations General Assembly and request recommendations, which the four powers agree to accept and take appropriate steps to implement. However, the promise given by the British government to Senussi during the war must be taken into consideration.

(4) The foreign ministers' representatives shall continue to discuss the issue of the disposal of Italian African colonies, and may send investigation teams to the above-mentioned places or any one place to search for materials related to the foreign ministers' meeting finally resolving the above issue.

### US-UK Cooperation Isolates the Soviet Union

Although the Italian colonial issue has not been completely resolved, only postponed for a year, the progress has been considerable, considering the initial differences among all parties and their development. We know that the Soviet Union originally intended to occupy the Dodecanese or to administer Tripolitania (Tripoliatnia) alone. However, in the first meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, the Soviet Union realized that its proposal would not pass and instead supported the United Nations' trusteeship or Italy's continued trusteeship of a portion of the territory, which was almost in line with the US opinion. Britain, with its strong interest in expanding its imperial power, especially considering that the Italian territories in Africa were already under its occupation, naturally wanted to take them for itself. Initially, it wanted to separate the handling of the colonial issue from the peace treaty itself, which was almost impossible in the first meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers. Therefore, it proposed to have Cyrenaica under British trusteeship and Libya granted independence, citing the British government's wartime promise to the Senussi. The British idea of independence was naturally modeled after countries like Egypt and Transjordan, making it another link in the sphere of influence of the British Empire. The Soviet Union attacked this most vehemently. Therefore, in the first meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, the British opinion on the colonial issue was very isolated, while being close to the French. However, in this (second) meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, the United States no longer opposed Britain, so the handling of the colonial issue actually passed completely according to Bevin's suggestion. Britain ultimately did not completely achieve its goals, but it was at least very close to its original plan. This shift seemed to have occurred after the first meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers and before the second meeting. Whether there was an understanding between Britain and the United States is unknown, but British diplomacy has always been known for its cleverness, exploiting the contradictions of other countries to seek its own interests, which is a consistent policy of British diplomacy. Also, in the second meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, the cooperation between Britain and the United States was seamless, far better than in the first meeting. Close cooperation between Britain and the United States and the complete isolation of the Soviet Union was one of the main reasons for the success of this meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers.

### US Withdrawals Lead to Soviet Concessions

In the Four Foreign Ministers meeting, in addition to the disputes regarding the peace treaty itself, there were also issues regarding the conference itself, such as the determination of the date, the inclusion of rules of procedure on the invitation, and the issue of inviting countries. Among these, the last one, related to China, involved the Soviet Union opposing China's inclusion as one of the invited countries. The US representative said that this action was tantamount to insulting China. The British representative said that he had no preconceptions about whether China should be included as one of the invited countries, as long as the Soviet Union did not intend to insult China. Molotov did not explicitly state that he did not intend to insult China, but also did not state that he did, so no one insisted on the matter.

In this meeting, secret negotiations were used extensively, thus avoiding many deadlocks caused by face-saving issues. Many small problems were compromised in advance, and passed smoothly in the meeting. The most effective way to prompt Soviet concessions was naturally the threat from Britain and the United States to directly submit the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and to separately negotiate a peace treaty. In large international conferences, the Soviet Union is often in the minority, which it has repeatedly experienced. And Italy is now under the influence of Britain and the United States. If the Soviet Union were to break with Britain and the United States and negotiate a peace treaty with Italy alone, it would probably gain even less, so it naturally preferred to make concessions. Therefore, every time the United States indicated that it was willing to withdraw, the Soviet Union was willing to make concessions, which was one of the main reasons for the success of the meeting.

### Answering Reporters: Legal Queries

(1) Question from Wang: My sister is 38 years old. She has been married for 20 years. The relationship between her and her husband was initially harmonious. Now, they have children. Although their family life is not wealthy, they have enough to eat and wear. However, good times don't last. My sister's husband has been seeking new romance since two years ago. He resents the family and often quarrels with them. Initially, my sister was unaware of this. After his behavior changed, she investigated and found out the truth, but her repeated劝劝劝 were ineffective. Now, my sister is suffering from mental breakdown and sometimes goes mad. If we take legal action, and the other party knowingly marries a married man, is there a crime of disrupting the family? Can the court rule for divorce? Otherwise, can the legal wife request a one-time payment of alimony and live separately?

[Answer from Lawyer Chuan Kuanlin:] According to the criminal law, a woman who has an affair with a married man commits the crime of disrupting the family. She can sue the other party in court and have them punished according to the relevant laws. If the legal wife does not pursue prosecution and wishes to live separately, she can request a one-time payment or monthly payment of lifelong alimony from her husband.

(2) Question from Luo Jiamo: My best friend, Mr. Mao, at the age of 17, through a matchmaker and his parents' decision, entered into a marriage contract with a woman who graduated from elementary school. Because of circumstances, I did not participate in the decision. Three years have passed since. My friend has the desire to terminate the contract and is often unhappy because of this. Now he is of legal age and should have the right to make his own decisions about marriage. However, it is impossible to directly negotiate a termination. My friend is afraid of delaying the woman's youth and wants to publish a statement in the newspaper declaring the marriage contract invalid. However, he does not know if there are any legal conflicts. Please have your legal expert advise.

[Answer from Lawyer Chuan Kuanlin:] According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, a marriage contract should be entered into by the man and woman themselves. Since Mr. Mao does not agree to the non-autonomous marriage contract, he can notify the woman in writing, stating that the marriage contract is invalid. If the woman does not agree, he can file a lawsuit in court to terminate the marriage contract.

(3) Question from Chang Dongliang: Your column has long been reputable. I have a question, please provide an answer. I am 23 years old this year. Three years ago, through a matchmaker's introduction, I became engaged to a 19-year-old woman and obtained the consent of both sets of parents. It was stated that the marriage contract would be fulfilled in three years. Now, I have suddenly received a letter of termination of the marriage contract. How should I respond? (1) Is this letter of termination of the marriage contract valid? (2) How should I proceed with the protest procedures? (3) How can I recover all the expenses and gifts from the engagement?

[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuanlin:] According to Article 975 of the Civil Code, the performance of a marriage contract cannot be enforced. Since the woman has decided to request the termination of the marriage contract, you can request compensation from her for all losses incurred during the engagement. If the woman refuses, you can file a lawsuit in court to claim damages.

### Pharmaceutical Factories Note the Expiration Dates on Injections

To Avoid Patient Suffering from Reactions

Recently, many "glucose injections" sold on the market are of poor quality due to prolonged storage. Patients are unaware of this. Within half an hour after injection, they experience chills, like a malaria attack, and gradually recover after 45 minutes, followed by fever. Doctors say this is a reaction caused by deterioration, which affects the patient's health. Therefore, I urge all pharmaceutical factories to affix "expiration dates" to each box so that buyers can know it at a glance. If pharmacies know that the goods have been stored for too long, please do not sell them. It is also an act of accumulating virtue. From Huang Aolin, who has been affected

### The Significance of Manual Arts

— Jiang Danshu

"Manual Arts" is a type of art. In the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic of China (1932-1933), the Ministry of Education revised the curriculum standards and designated it as a course term. Since then, it has been highly valued by educators. Even the Ministry regulations stipulate that students who fail in manual arts must repeat a grade because manual arts is an artistic instinct inherent in human beings.

Some people think that manual arts is about teaching skills, but this is not entirely accurate. It should be known that its educational significance outweighs its technical significance. Taking primary school as an example, children's nature is that none of them do not like to labor, do not like to make, in other words, everyone likes to move, likes to tinker, (pronounced gǎo, in Hangzhou dialect). As long as there is something to tinker with, anything is fine.

People Have an Innate Laboring Nature Regardless of whether they are the sons of officials or commoners, city dwellers or rural people, they are all the same. This is the "innate laboring nature" common to all human beings. This nature is the "source of life and the instinct of art." People cannot live without labor, nor should they live without it. Therefore, this nature is very precious and should be cultivated and developed in educational methods and opportunities, and should not be obliterated or diminished. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "What Heaven imparts to man is called his nature; an accordance with this nature is called the Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction." Since we have this good nature, we should naturally follow this natural principle and train him according to the situation. The so-called method of guiding the situation is the manual arts class. This is the important principle for "manual arts" to become a type of "education."

The manual arts class in primary schools is to cultivate laboring habits, not to impart various skills. The manual arts class in middle schools certainly needs to attach importance to some skills, but it is not to impart specialized

Manual Arts Can Cure Fashionable Diseases skills, but still focus on cultivating laboring habits and working interests. To put it more clearly, focus on "curing diseases," "curing diseases." If these diseases can be fundamentally cured, then you can step into the "reality," "diligence," "frugality," "integrity," and "chastity" moral circles. At this time when human desires are rampant and extravagance has become a custom, the old dandies have transformed into new slickers, with hair greased, bodies upright, clothes scented, and feet shining. These people are everywhere. Especially some modern wives, besides cosmetics, use blood-red nail polish, besides bracelets, wear anklets like shackles. They certainly have not labored, are unwilling to labor, and even want to look down on the other party's laborers, laugh at them for wearing queues, and despise the virtue of others' diligence, while boasting about their beauty and dressing up their precious little citizens like foreign dolls, indulging them like Jia Baoyu, hiring cars to pick them up from school and cars to pick them up from the park. Sometimes they even take them to red-light green-screen places to eat delicacies and watch dances, cultivating a habit of daintiness, laziness, extravagance, and superficiality from a young age, making it an incurable second nature! The art of manual labor is a painful针砭 for this root of the disease. You must have your foreign doll sweep the floor, wipe the table, pour out the chamber pot, mix mud, learn to be a little carpenter, a little tailor, and also go to the garden to learn how to grow vegetables, flowers, and trees, water, and fertilize, making your foreign doll like a little apprentice and a little shepherd boy. It is precisely because of this that families who do not understand art education object. The child comes back, and his clothes are dirty. The mother asks what he is doing. The child says he is doing manual arts. So the ears of the manual arts teacher must be burning hot from afar, right? In fact, the children themselves are not afraid of labor, not afraid of work, not afraid of getting dirty, and do not think of themselves as young masters and young ladies. They like to do manual arts very much, which shows that the nature of labor is indeed innate. Education should follow nature and not go against it. On this point, it is hoped that the family's views will be consistent with the school so that the second generation of citizens who are democratic and equal can be cultivated.

I firmly believe that a person who has received consistent, systematic, and good manual arts education from family and school from childhood to adulthood can cultivate such a "character model." - If there is no ready-made food to eat, they can cook for themselves; if clothes are torn, they can mend them; if they are dirty, they can wash themselves, and if they are seen doing these things by friends, they do not feel embarrassed;

Manual Arts Can Cultivate Good Character Types if the legs of a stool are broken, they can fix them; if a light bulb is broken, they can repair it; when going out to prevent rain, they can take a paper umbrella or a broken foreign umbrella; if they encounter rain halfway, they can walk barefoot; they can usually grow vegetables and raise chickens, and they can chop firewood and catch fish temporarily; if the old master goes on strike, they can倒目倒 the toilet; if the rickshaw puller knocks on the bamboo clapper, they can lift their feet and walk by themselves; if the cost of living is too high and the income is too low, and it is not enough to maintain integrity, they can also make small crafts to sell for money or use themselves;... But if they can suddenly rise to prominence, they can also be good officials; because they have such abilities, they are naturally honest in ordinary times and will not lose their integrity in times of change, can be content in poverty, and will not be arrogant and lustful in wealth. If you don't believe it, please open history and look: the great statesman Shun was born as a farmer, fisherman, and kiln worker; Yi Yin was born as a farmer; our Jiang Taigong was also born as a fisherman; the young Zhu Maichen was born as a woodcutter; Tao Yuanming and Zhuge Liang also practiced farming; and many great masters were able to live by themselves and provide for themselves; they all have complex minds, simple lives, goods in their stomachs, and no airs on their faces. In other words, they are typical figures who are both civil and military, both rough and fine. When they were not officials or not rich, they did not think about being officials every day or think about getting rich every night. After they became officials, they could naturally take out the spirit of hard work to do things for the public, unlike later generations, especially modern people, who put on airs everywhere and always want to make money; it can be seen that labor and knowledge are not only not contrary to each other, but also complement each other, so I hope that wise families and the general public will not say that labor is worthless and oppose it.

### The Founding Writers of Literati Painting: Zong Bing and Wang Wei

— Yu Jianhua

Most people believe that Chinese literati painting was founded by Wang Wei and Wang Qia in the Tang Dynasty. Dong Qichang in the Ming Dynasty even divided the painters of past dynasties into two major schools, the Southern School and the Northern School, and used the method of "yellow robe adding body" to honor Wang Wei as the founder of the Southern School. This is really a bit of "forgetting one's ancestors" because the real founders of literati painting were Zong Bing and Wang Wei, who were more than three hundred years earlier than Wang Wei.

Zong Bing, courtesy name Shaowen, was a native of Nieyang, Nanyang. He was born in the second year of Emperor Xiaowu's Ningkang of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (374 AD) and died in the twentieth year of Emperor Wen's Yuanjia of the Song Dynasty (443 AD) at the age of sixty-nine. He was contemporary with Gu Kaizhi, and his death was about thirty years after Gu's. Wang Wei, courtesy name Jingxuan, was a native of Linyi. He was born in the eleventh year of Emperor An's Yixi of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (415 AD) and died in the twentieth year of Emperor Wen's Yuanjia of the Song Dynasty at the age of only twenty-nine. He was born in the year of Gu Kaizhi's death, and died in the same year as Zong Bing, which can be said to be extremely coincidental, but their lifespans were different.

Zong Bing and Wang Wei not only lived in the same era, but their personalities, learning, art, and writings had many similarities. Bing "lived in mourning excessively, and was praised by the villages," "his wife, Luo, also had high sentiments and shared interests with Shaowen. After Luo died, Shaowen was excessively grieved." He did his best to support the orphans of his two elder brothers, which shows that he was a virtuous gentleman. Wang Wei was also a person who was devoted to his siblings. His younger brother, Sengqian, had talent and learning. When he fell ill, Wei treated him himself. Sengqian died because he took medicine improperly. Wei deeply blamed himself and fell ill. Forty days after Sengqian's death, he died at the young age of twenty-nine.

Zong Bing was "skilled in Qin books and refined in reasoning," while Wang Wei was "fond of learning since childhood and had read everything, was good at writing, calligraphy, and painting, and also understood music, medicine, Yin-Yang techniques, and divination." It can be said that both were versatile artists.

Although Zong Bing's family was very poor, he was not seduced by profits. Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty wanted to recruit him as a secretary, but he declined. When asked why, he said, "Bing has lived in the hills and valleys for thirty years." Emperor Wu appreciated his answer and stopped. He asked to be a hermit who could roam the mountains and forests and live in the hills and valleys, but he was unwilling to be a secretary who would follow the trend and fawn on others. His high character can also be imagined. He also liked to "live in leisure and tranquility" to cultivate his moral character. As for Wang Wei, he also "often lived in a room, reading books and playing with antiques, without going out for more than ten years." Emperor Shizu gave him the title of Secretary because he was chaste and reclusive, and he was also a noble who did not like to be an official. These two people's attitude seems too passive and too grey in modern times, without the active spirit of saving the world and helping the people. However, an artist needs a chaste and reclusive personality in order to not be lured by profits, not be subdued by power, and be able to roam freely in the spiritual realm of heaven and earth without being touched by external things. This spirit of despising corruption and standing upright, not taking anything, has been passed down from Chao Fu, Xu You, Boyi, Shuqi, Lao Tzu, and Zhuang Zhou to Zong Bing and Wang Wei. It is a kind of transcendent attitude in Chinese philosophy, ethics, and art, and it has formed the original life of Chinese art. "If a person's character is not high, the ink cannot be used properly." If an artist does not have a noble character, his works will not have eternal value. It is a pity that many people who call themselves artists now forget (or simply do not know) the fundamental starting point of Chinese artists. They follow the trend in their daily production, catering to what wealthy merchants like. In the era of precarious national fortune, they do not hesitate to fawn on the enemy and serve the enemy. Such people have no backbone, no character. Even if their skills are very pure and the colors are very gorgeous, and all their works are bought by people who see with their ears instead of their eyes, they are actually worthless. They are false works with only shells and lacking souls, and are not enough to pass on to future generations.

Zong Bing had "Preface to Painting Landscape" and Wang Wei had "Preface to Painting" and other writings. They are the earliest and most wonderful treasures in Chinese painting theory. Not only are the words high and wonderful, but their elaboration of the principles of painting has unique insights. The main point is to liberate painting from the practical aspects and give it a free, lively, ethereal, and ideal realm. From then on, it became the source of literati painting, and made Chinese art. Possess a "distinctly different" style.

### About the Art Center Station

— Shi Chongpeng

The Art Center Station – this name seems quite unfamiliar. To put it grandly, it's an unprecedented initiative in the history of Chinese education; to put it simply, it's the establishment of this simple art education institution due to the current financial constraints in education and culture.

It has been nearly forty years since China began implementing new education, but art education has yet to be popularized. Any beautiful works of art are not appreciated by the general public, and any valuable art exhibitions do not receive the attention of the general public, as if art has no relation to society. In the past, educational authorities did not pay attention to this issue, and schools did not value this issue. Therefore, there are no art institutions such as art galleries or painting galleries established in society, and the general public cannot obtain tools for lofty spiritual adjustment. Art classes in schools have become nominal subjects that are neither alive nor dead, and all equipment and teachers are empty and extremely incomplete. Students' parents look down on art, believing it to be of no practical use, and students do not take art education seriously.

After the restoration of this city, the educational authorities first noticed the issue of art education. Thus, the Art Center Station was born. Its purpose, to put it succinctly, is to promote public art education and to solve the difficulties of art education facilities and teachers in various schools in this city. It is hoped that the general public will understand the relationship between art and life, and then pursue a rational spiritual life in the direction of art; at the same time, to enable the serious implementation of art education in this city. The work goals of the Art Center Station are briefly introduced below: The work goals of the Art Center Station are two:

(1) To promote the appreciation and research of art among the general public;

(2) To assist in the implementation of art education in schools.

The first item can be implemented through five methods:

(1) Hold various art exhibitions; (2) Organize art lectures; (3) Set up mobile painting galleries; (4) Convene symposiums for the art community; (5) Organize amateur art research classes.

The second item can be implemented through four methods: (1) Research art teaching materials and teaching methods; (2) Supply art teaching tools and equipment; (Schools near the Art Center Station can schedule dates to come to the station for practice). (3) Guide art teachers in further study; (Hold art education demonstrations). (4) Enhance the effectiveness of art education. (Special training will be given to children with artistic talent.)

Proceeding according to these two major goals, the work is very difficult. It is hoped that domestic art educators and artists will provide assistance in various ways so that art education in this city can achieve considerable success.

### Methods of Arranging Landscape Paintings (Part 1)

— Cheng Mingshi

For those who study landscape painting, as long as their talent is not particularly low, understanding the methods of using the brush and ink is relatively easy. As for the actual techniques of painting trees and rocks, they are even easier to learn. However, for composition—that is, the method of arrangement—beginners not only find it difficult to apply, but also find it not very easy to understand the principles. Now we will focus on explaining this point in more detail, so that we can break the bad habit of only being able to copy but not create drafts.

To explain the arrangement of landscape paintings, we must first explain the principles of composition in landscape paintings. Originally, the composition of landscape paintings is not a realistic depiction of the scenery, but a reduction of the real scenery using a bird's-eye view, and then a depiction of it. For example, when we go to the countryside to see real landscapes, what we can see with our eyes is only a layer of mountains or a stretch of water. Such simple scenery is not easy to constitute a landscape painting. We have to go deep into the landscape, view all the scenery, and then return home and reduce what we have experienced like drawing a map. The painter makes himself very large and the scenery very small, as if he is looking down on the mountains, so that he can form a "thousand miles within a foot" picture. Once we understand this point, we can know the principle of "perspective," so we cannot fully apply it to Chinese landscape painting.

However, having said that, some Chinese landscape paintings are very similar to real scenes, such as those by Mi Fu, Ma Yuan, and Xia Gui in the Song Dynasty; and Shi Tao, Shi Xi, Bada Shanren, and Mei Qing in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties. However, these are just variations in Chinese landscape painting and cannot represent the orthodox painting method of Chinese landscape painting. The landscape paintings we usually see are always characterized by layers of mountains and distant landscapes, which can only be imagined in the mind or seen in paintings. We cannot see them all in the real natural world.

Some people say that Chinese landscape paintings represent the scenery seen from above. This statement does have considerable reason, because the higher a person stands, the wider the view, and the smaller the things seen. As the saying goes, "Confucius climbed Mount Dongshan and found Lu small, climbed Mount Tai and found the world small," which is the same principle. However, if Chinese landscape paintings were really writing the scenery seen from above, then the things at the foot of the mountain could not be seen very large and clear. Now, ordinary mountains and paintings always focus on the scenery at the foot of the mountain. The so-called main trees, main rocks, and water are often described in great detail, while the mountain peaks above are mostly described in general terms. This is still not in line with the principle of perspective, so the reason that Chinese landscape paintings depict the scenery seen from above is still not very satisfactory, but it seems to have this trend.

In short, Chinese landscape painting paints poetry, paints materials that have been cut by poets, not the original dull mountains and clumsy water. Therefore, the complex scenery, thousands of mountains and valleys, is extremely majestic; the simple scenery, one tree and one rock, is extremely open and spacious. It is abstract, literary, and even philosophical, and cannot be explained by scientific theories. This is its shortcoming, and it is also its strength.

There are usually three rules for the scenery in Chinese landscape paintings: The first is Pingyuan (level distance)—the scenery seen from near to far, the arrangement should be flat and open, not high and steep. The second is Gaoyuan (high distance)—the scenery seen from below to above, the arrangement should be high, dangerous, and steep, not flat and deep. The third is Shenyuan (deep distance)—the scenery seen from the outside to the inside, the arrangement should be deep and distant, not shallow and solid. There are also Pingyuan that combines Gaoyuan or Shenyuan, Gaoyuan that combines Shenyuan or Pingyuan, and Shenyuan that combines Pingyuan or Gaoyuan. However, the various layout methods are ever-changing, but their principles are ultimately nothing more than the principle of "three distances." (Small and horizontal paintings are suitable for Pingyuan, horizontal paintings are also suitable for Shenyuan, large and vertical paintings are suitable for Gaoyuan and Shenyuan, and vertical paintings are especially suitable for Gaoyuan).

The Pingyuan scenery often uses slopes and sand and water to express; the Gaoyuan scenery often uses paths and waterfalls to express; the Shenyuan scenery often uses layers and clouds and smoke to express. This is also something that those who study landscape painting should know.

Regardless of Pingyuan, Gaoyuan, and Shenyuan, there is only one secret to arranging the layers of trees, rocks, and mountains: the "inverted V arrangement method." The so-called "inverted V" is an inverted V. For example, if you draw a clump of trees and rocks on the left, count it as one layer, and then draw a clump of trees and rocks on the right, it is another layer. The left side of the left is high and slopes downward to the right, and the right side of the right is high and slopes downward to the left. The structure of these two layers becomes an inverted V. Then draw a mountain peak on the left and a mountain peak on the right, and it becomes an inverted V again. Repeatedly superimposed in this way, it becomes countless inverted V's (Pingyuan has fewer layers. Gaoyuan and Shenyuan have more layers, especially Shenyuan, if there are not many layers, it lacks the fun of secludedness). However, the size of the area occupied by each layer should not be uniform. The first layer has a large area, the second layer should be smaller, the third layer has a small area, and the fourth layer should be larger. By changing in this way, the layout will not be rigid. Also, in the middle of the three large "V"s, there are often many small "V"s; in short, there is no place that is not different, no place that does not change, so that all abilities can be exhausted.

### Artistic Musings

— Translated by Huang Hanqiu, written by Takarmura

The meaning of art should not be regarded as the "freehand" expression that the world usually talks about. It would be a mistake to compare the feeling of tired people in the actual social life who, when waiting quietly for dinner in the evening, are presented with a glass of wine hidden from the Napoleonic era to art. However, it has become a common thing in the world to compare it to art, and it can enable people in the world to obtain such things, which is considered the ability of an artist. Of course, there are not a few people who do not think this way, but in fact, there are many who think this way. Art brings comfort to people, increases interest, and as a result, people who have tasted the bitterness of actual society seem to have obtained a valuable flavor enhancer. It is now common sense in the world to think in this way.

According to such a reality, the original tone of the world is lowered, so people in such a reality do not pay attention to their original weakness, and this failure to pay attention is completely pathological.

In the past, a German poet had a theory that art originated from people's play instinct, and many scholars were superstitious about this theory. Although this can be explained by using the remaining power of people's lives to tend towards art, it seems like a big mistake to treat people's entertainment desire and artistic desire as the same thing.

Art is not to comfort people but to strengthen people's will; it is not to increase interest but to make people think. It makes people go upward, makes people progress, and makes people more satisfied. It is not to soothe the bitterness of daily life with palliative means, but to give the strength of the root that can endure bitterness. In actual social life, it is not used to comfort the groaning and moaning updating, but to give the nutrients to eliminate the groaning and moaning. It is like a kind of incredible magic that teaches people that although the body is tired, the soul is not tired. Focusing on art is to open up a bright world for people. Art is to show people and the true picture of the myriad phenomena surrounding people, so that people can realize the true "beauty" at the bottom of this floating and impermanent phase that flows in the present world. It makes people deviate from the life limited to comrades as objects, and always keeps things above in their hearts, and makes life go upward. And it makes people grasp the meaning of the world. It does not require speculation, but makes it directly obtained. In the world, it is often the case that people who are clear about the ways of the world, who are well versed in human relationships, and who are insightful into the twists and turns of human affairs fully savor the meaning of the world. However, this is nothing more than a dictionary. Although it is valuable, it is only useful for people who own accumulated materials. The reason for wanting to keep this valuable material is still unknown. Starting from the unknown place, most people fall into low-level enlightenment, or simply continue this evil game and spend their lives. Art is a way to restore health to a world in this pathological state.

Conversely, there is no such powerful art, it is very low-level art. Art that is played with or caressed should not be called art.

Production and Construction

### The Psychology of Self-Confidence

— Wang Ying

Published every Monday

In the industrial world, the psychology of self-confidence is very important, especially when the current industry is in a dangerous situation. Many people in charge of factories believe that Chinese industry, in this situation, can be said to have no hope. This psychology is because of a lack of self-confidence.

In fact, as long as we work hard, improve quality, and strive for construction, the products of Chinese industry can also be equal to the goods manufactured by advanced countries. Therefore, we should create a psychology of self-confidence through hard work, and start from the psychology of self-confidence to have a practical expression. After the quality of goods is improved, not only can they gain a foothold, but they can also develop rapidly.

### Key Points of Textile Industry Construction

— Zheng Jian

The textile industry is the most important industry for people's livelihood. All daily clothing and supplies are required from this industry. Now, based on what the management office knows, the key points of my country's textile industry construction in the future are listed below, and I hope that industry leaders will give their corrections.

(A) Essential prerequisites for building the textile industry:

(1) First, require the government to do its best to resolve the current serious political problems, stop the civil war, and allow people to live and work in peace and contentment.

(2) Restore national water and land transportation as soon as possible to facilitate the exchange of materials. So that production can remain normal. And purchase new textile machines, and imitate them to increase production.

(3) Increase foreign exchange, and the import of textiles that can be woven independently should be reduced as much as possible to avoid threats.

(4) Encourage those who improve and invent in the textile industry and those who are enthusiastic about progress.

(5) Strive to restore the original overseas textile market and foundation, such as the Nanyang Islands.

(6) Labor and management work together to eliminate labor disputes, and strive to increase production to reach the standard and compete with other countries. At that time, according to the book "China's Destiny" compiled by Chairman Chiang, it will be possible to expand the 10 million spindles of textile machines that should be set up throughout the country in the future in a timely manner, so that the people of the whole country can be self-sufficient in clothing. The above are prerequisites.

(B) Key points of improvement and construction: The first is the psychological construction of people, which must be corrected:

After the victory of the Great War and the restoration of the country, material construction must be carried out as soon as possible, and psychological and spiritual construction must not be delayed. In today's arduous era of nation-building, our psychology and spirit should be based on serving the country and serving the society. Everything must be realistic and hardworking, and we must shoulder the arduous work after this glorious victory. Always with the purpose of "serving and serving," I especially hope that comrades who are engaged in this career will work together to thoroughly reform the current complicated psychological and spiritual construction.

(C) Use scientific methods to combine theory and practice; The theory of science clearly states that the progress of industry depends on the proper application of science. For example, some workers in a textile factory have a high level of education, but they still feel insufficient in practical experience, while others have experience but lack knowledge, so there is often "knowing what it is, but not knowing why it is." The former relies on their knowledge, and the latter relies on their experience, but they cannot be used together, so this is one of the reasons for their backwardness. The author believes that factories should attach employee training centers and technical training classes to increase the academic and technical skills of employees, and train them using the method of part-time work and part-time study so that general employees can combine theory and practice and have a clear understanding of the application of science.

(D) Mechanical maintenance and personnel management: "If a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." If the tools are sharp, the job will be done well. This is an unchanging truth from ancient times to the present. The structure of textile machinery is complex. If the machinery is sophisticated, the production efficiency can be increased; maintenance is to maintain the machinery to increase its life, can give play to the efficiency of the machinery, and achieve the maximum amount of the best products. It is found that my country's textile machinery is almost entirely purchased from abroad, and the forms are complex and varied. Often, the machinery used in one factory has as many as six or seven names. Therefore, the difference in the organization makes management and use particularly inconvenient. Due to the difference in the components, if one is missing, it cannot be repaired. As a result, it takes a long time. Due to the difference in the organization, the use of tools is also difficult to generalize. Maintenance is inconvenient, and it is also difficult to attract maintenance talents who are proficient in various machines. The author believes that the machinery used in textiles in the future must be carefully selected and unified, and then the Chinese will imitate them themselves. This will not only benefit a lot from maintenance, but the entire textile industry wants to develop, and it must devote itself to this. (3) Increase the number of schools to cultivate textile talents: My country has a cultural history of four or five thousand years! It is much earlier than European and American countries, but it has not paid attention to science and engineering education, so it is difficult for the development of the entire national industry to reach a high level. The prosperity of the United Kingdom and the United States and the continuous progress of their textile industries are all because the people have received considerable education, especially paying more attention to science and engineering education. The creativity and invention of the British and Americans, and the spirit of the Japanese in being good at imitation, are all based on the high progress of science and engineering education. We cannot talk about creating profits and inventions, but at least we must have the ability to imitate others, and we should be cautious and work hard. At the same time, I hope that the government should increase the number of specialized schools to cultivate textile talents, such as state-owned textile factories should actively prepare to increase the number of textile schools in the short term so that those who are already employed but lack knowledge can seek opportunities for advancement. And at any time to cultivate the large number of textile talents needed in the future to solve the problem of lack.

### New Anesthetic

The California State Medical University recently invented an anesthetic that allows chest surgery to be performed with an electric knife in the future. Anesthetics such as ether and propane are explosive. When using electricity, an electric spark must be used to close many small veins and arteries. Otherwise, ether and propane will cause the electric spark to explode in the patient's lungs. This new anesthetic is two extremely potent poisons, nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide) and curare (a poison used by South American natives to coat arrowheads, made from a certain plant). Nitrous oxide puts the patient to sleep, and curare paralyzes the patient's respiratory muscles.

A huge 90,000 kilovolt generator is being assembled in the United States in preparation for shipment to the South Markland Dnieper power plant in the Soviet Union. The machine was specially designed for the Soviet Union by the New York General Electric Company. A total of three units will be transported to Markland to replace those destroyed by the German army during the war. (Special correspondent of this newspaper from the New York Times)

### The Movement to Love National Products

— Yi

The movement to love national products has been launched by all parties and has begun to be promoted. This was explained in detail in the previous issue of this journal, and it is a movement to correct psychology, which will have a great impact on the future.

Chinese industry is really facing unprecedented difficulties, but if we can correct the wrong psychology of the public, and increase the sales of Chinese industrial products through the love of national products, even if we do not revive Chinese industry, we may be able to take the movement to love national products as a starting point.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

Third, the quality of raw materials must always be consistent and should not be changed:

The most taboo thing in manufacturing and selling goods is the decline in the quality of goods. At the beginning of the first issue, the quality was very good, but later, it gradually declined. The reason for the decline in quality is often that it is impossible to purchase the same raw materials as the first batch for a while (because they were collected by others and could not be bought for a while, or because the price of raw materials increased, they had to use the next grade of raw materials). The result of the decline in quality is often that sales are getting worse and worse, and even the goods cannot be sold.

Many manufacturing plants, such as pharmaceutical factories, must first perform chemical tests when purchasing raw materials, and only accept them if the chemical tests are qualified. Many original raw materials cannot be unsealed for chemical testing, so they can only be purchased from reliable experts and reliable manufacturers.

Due to the above three points, it can be proved that raw materials have a great relationship with the sales of goods and the future of the company, so it is natural to be cautious when purchasing raw materials.

The raw materials mentioned here include various raw materials used in manufacturing plants, and the decoration of goods. Such as glass bottles, etc., can also be applied. The principle mentioned here, according to the results of expert research, a manufacturing plant should not make too many types of goods. It may be better to manufacture a few types first, and then add new products after the sales are smooth and the foundation is stable. If many goods are manufactured at the same time, it will require many different raw materials and decorations, and the funds will be scattered. In case the goods cannot be sold well, the funds will be trapped, especially the decorations, which are difficult to sell, and there is no hope of recovering the money after it is paid out.

The Work of Purchasing Materials

The relationship between raw materials and goods has been mentioned above, and now we will talk about the method of purchasing materials.

Those who are in charge of purchasing materials may be a purchasing committee, or a purchasing director, who is responsible for the matter, but the principle of purchasing materials is the same.

A person in charge of purchasing materials must possess the following conditions in order to make his purchasing work produce excellent results: 1. Familiar with the market situation: How much inventory is there in the market for various raw materials (that is, how much quantity is there in the market in total)? Their consumption and the rise and fall of market prices should be investigated in detail. Therefore, a person in charge of purchasing materials should frequently contact all relevant parties so that he can obtain relatively rapid and reliable information, which can provide a lot of convenience in the purchasing work.

2. Strong judgment: After obtaining information, whether to purchase immediately and how much to purchase should be decided immediately, so a person in charge must have strong judgment. When the molten iron of the large furnace of the Ford Motor Factory is poured out, sparks fly in all directions. Due to the shortage of steel supply, the Ford steel plant is working day and night to increase production to meet the needs. (Special correspondent of this newspaper from the New York Times)

### The Need for Hard Work

— Shao Fu

"We should investigate where our shortcomings lie. Is it talent? Knowledge? Then, we should strive to overcome them. Perhaps we will need to endure five or ten more years of hardship, but if we only endure hardship without exploration and research, the period of hardship will only be prolonged. Our cultural and educational circles should clench their teeth during these five or ten years…"

The above is a conclusion drawn by Mr. Hu Shih, upon his return to Shanghai after nine years abroad, during his first public speech.

After the September 18th Incident, the student strikes and worker strikes in Shanghai were surging. Everyone was in no mood to study. I remember a German geometry professor advising us not to shout and clamor乱嚷乱呌. He said that such clamoring was not only not patriotic but harmful to the country. He said: After Germany was defeated in the First World War, the whole country, from top to bottom, did not shout or clamor. Everyone silently buried themselves in hard work. Students studied and researched desperately, and workers worked desperately. They usually worked eight hours a day, but at that time, they worked almost twelve hours. Fifteen years of hard work restored the country's strength, and we were no longer afraid of any foreign aggression.

Today, our war of resistance has been won, and we are respectfully one of the four major powers. But honestly, we are so ashamed! Comparing anything with others, we are ashamed beyond words. Japan is now a defeated country. Friends who have returned from Tokyo say that they do not have the emotions of mourning their parents. They have rallied their spirits to do all kinds of work. Silk exports have already recovered, many factories have gradually started operating, and food shortages are addressed by tightening their belts and saving, while also stepping up production and inventing various substitutes to supplement it. The atmosphere of studying is even more intense. No matter what political party, all are starting with restoring national strength. It is not alarmist to say that if our generation does not strive and lay a solid foundation, another Sino-Japanese war might occur in ten or twenty years. At that time, it will be difficult for us to encounter such good luck as we have now. Therefore, for the sake of our children and grandchildren, as Mr. Hu Shih said, we should clench our teeth and bury ourselves in hard work during these five or ten years!

### "Speculating on the Black Market" - Recent Events in Hong Kong

— Fang Jun

The term "official price" 公價 seems to be a product of this war, appearing in the world at the same time as the term "rationing" 配給. Black markets, however, have existed since ancient times and did not begin today. But they flourished during the previous World War and were rampant during this war. The degree of rampancy was worse than the plague. Not only were large cities universally infected with this suffering, but even remote rural areas were also widely covered with poisonous bacteria and growing slowly. To this day, its influence has not diminished slightly.

Hong Kong, like other cities, has almost turned even the air into a black market. The black market controls the entire market, and the black market has permeated the blood of every citizen; from the moment each citizen opens their eyes in the morning until they close them again at night, if they haven't made a circuit in the black market that day, their life will have some imperfections, perhaps some indispensable imperfections.

When Hong Kong was occupied, the black market was controlled by the Japanese, as black as a flock of crows, and as dark as the darkest night. After the Japanese were locked up in Stanley, the Chinese and British copied a set of old articles from the Japanese, added some genius creations, and the Hong Kong black market changed from an imperialist black market to a democratic black market. It also flourished a lot, with imported goods brought in by warships, and imported goods almost included everything needed for life. But they were only military supplies. Later, even British and American goods became black market goods. The black market dominates the people, and the black market also prospers today's Hong Kong.

Then there was the official price 公價, and the government said, "Anything exceeding the official price is the black market." Gradually, the government expanded its control from rice and grain.

——Now, the Hong Kong government declares that it will attack the black market and have a decisive battle with the black market.

The first step in the attack or decisive battle is to send out "assault vehicles" 衝鋒車 to arrest black market hawkers. The hawkers fly all over the streets, fly away and then gather again. Reassembling, there is a black market, which makes it even more of a black market. The second step is to punish black market shops. The government authorizes courts or judges to enforce the black market regulations against shops selling black market goods. The first time a shop sells black market goods, it is punished with a month of closure and suspension of business, then six months, but only targeting cigarettes and alcohol. The Jin Cheng Restaurant was the first to be punished, but it was only fined and not closed, because its crime occurred before the regulations were announced, and the judge or court had not yet received the authority granted by the government.

But the black market doesn't seem to care about this at all. The government is launching its attack, but the black market is still the black market today.

The black market is organized. According to government investigations and public statements, the black market organization has a spy network to find out the types of goods arriving in Hong Kong, and directly purchase goods from importers or wholesalers, but not by forced purchases, but by threatening fair transactions. The fairness of the transaction can allow importers or wholesalers to obtain considerable profits. After the black market gang gets the goods, they hand them over to hawkers to sell. The hawkers then pay the black market gang considerable profits, and the hawkers charge customers considerable profits. With the layers of added profits, only consumers feel that the burden is too heavy.

The black market organization is tight-knit and has great latent power. Sometimes, even goods with official prices are controlled by them, which means that goods with official prices are snatched up, and consumers have no choice but to seek them from the black market.

The black market occupies the entire territory of Hong Kong, even the airspace. People in Hong Kong are getting everything they need from the black market. But some people in Hong Kong are indifferent, some don't even know what a black market is, and some go to "eat" the black market.

——Eating the black market can be quite impressive.

There are even those who use the black market to create another black market or double black market goods, and this is called "speculating on the black market".

So, the world now has two symbols: one is the "black market" and the other is the "atom".

### Comic Strip - Sanmao Joins the Army (66)

— Written by Zhang Leping

### The Fool

— Wen

"The so-called fool" thinker Chuan Baikun once explained it this way: "A person who kicks aside considerations of personal gain and loss, and acts solely according to their own pure and unadorned heart, is definitely not someone who seeks temporary ease or just gets by. Instead, they are able to think fundamentally and thoroughly about everything, and can implement the answer in their own environment. They are able to constantly add new things to the burning flame of life, so they are also unwilling to be self-satisfied."

It seems that "similar fools" are rarely found in this profit-driven society, I think few people are willing to be that; but thinking carefully, the world is always being constantly improved by the "fool's" strength; humankind's ability to evolve to this point today is because there are many fools, big and small, working hard. If not, who knows what the world would be like!

If there were no Copernicus, Darwin, and many tireless fools, perhaps the world would still be ruled by the forces of superstition. If it weren't for 　　this fool who was not afraid of authority and created the theory of the social contract, perhaps the common people would still be living an inhuman life under feudal power. If China had not sacrificed many fools in the repeatedly failed revolutions, perhaps our country would not be a republic today. However, times have changed, and such fools have become historical figures. We don't need to expect them to reappear like ghosts 幽　. Everyone should make up their mind to start from themselves. Even if we can't be a big fool, we should still be a small fool. If we can't be a hundred-point fool, we should at least be a sixty-point fool. But don't ever try to be a one hundred and twenty-point smart person. Look at those smart people like Wang Jingwei, like speculative profiteers, who 　can say they aren't smart? But what have they contributed to China and to mankind? What are their consequences? So, I would like to respectfully say it again: "I hope everyone can be a useful fool." The more fools, the more hope there is for China, and the more humankind will evolve!

### Please, British Tram Company, Take a Look at Others!

— Xia Jiansheng

Amidst the voices of criticism and dissatisfaction with the tram today, I do not intend to deliberately go against the grain and praise the French Tram. Frankly speaking, it does have the following advantages:

Regarding vehicles: French Line 2 (1, 5, 10) trams, at any station, except for special reasons, the tram will definitely arrive within three minutes, and the three lines come in sequence. Except for occasional differences due to the length of the journey, within ten minutes, the line you need will arrive. After arriving at the station, the door will definitely open, but because the vehicle capacity is limited, some passengers will inevitably be excluded from the door, but don't worry, within ten minutes, the line you need will come again.

Also, regarding the morality of conductors: the French are also more disciplined and never pocket money. However, in crowded or rushed situations, there may be occasional forgetfulness. But if you mention it, they will immediately find it for you. I have had this experience many times and it is definitely correct.

The advantages of the French tram are nothing more than the large number of cars, proper allocation, and serious operation. We hope that the British Tram Company authorities will: take a look at others!

### Looking at One's Reflection and Feeling Sorry for Oneself

— Chang Gong

Lily is a beautiful, unmarried nurse. After she came to my house three times, I found that she was quite interested in the mirror. I put on a "seeing nothing" pose and secretly made an interesting record:

In a corner of my living room is an old-fashioned dressing table with an oval mirror in the middle that can reflect half of the body. As soon as Lily entered the door, she took her purse to this table, and then faced the mirror, greeting the people in the room while brushing her soft hair on her shoulders.

The second time she looked in the mirror was about ten minutes later. She ran to the table, reached into her purse to take out a package of "Xiao Zhi Long" 消治龍 pills, and glanced at Lily in the mirror.

The subsequent times varied in length because the living room was too small, and our Lily was not used to sitting for long. Her slender body stood up, and after moving slightly, she and that lovely mirror formed parallel lines. Lily stood in the posture of a "willow in the wind", chatting for about three minutes, and glancing sideways at the mirror no less than three times.

My sister suddenly talked about the various hair styles, which naturally aroused Lily's high interest. She simply stood in front of the mirror and compared them for a full three and a half minutes.

My sister was busy going to the kitchen to cook, and I also quietly went to the back room, which was not lit all day, to fumble around for a while. Lily was left alone in the living room. Suddenly, I looked up and saw Lily leaning over the table through the small window facing the dressing table, enjoying the pleasure of "looking around freely". I remember reading in a passage by Gorky: when a person is alone in a room, they will let out all the most innocent and ridiculous movements, which is a kind of liberation of human nature. Therefore, I thought that Lily must have obtained this kind of "liberation of nature" at this time. It was hateful that in less than two minutes, my sister's slippers came Xiang'ed from the hallway, and Lily had to sadly re-enter the restraints of the human world and quickly left the mirror.

After the meal, after washing her face, the脂粉 powder on Lily's face was patchy and uneven. This time, she openly and clearly aligned herself with the mirror and applied it extensively. When she left, she had to take the purse on the table. Taking the purse inevitably meant facing forward and getting one last close look at the mirror, which could be said to be quite fortunate, before leaving gracefully.

Lily stayed at my house for a total of two and a half hours between coming and going.

Writing to this point, my recording responsibility can be considered complete. If readers are interested, you may wish to take the trouble to calculate: How many times did Lily look in the mirror in these two and a half hours? On average, how many minutes was it per time? If she continues like this, in total, how much of her life will be spent on the mirror?

### An Encounter with Mr. Lang Jingshan

— Fan Tu

One hot afternoon, I met the famous photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan on the second floor of the Xin Ya Restaurant.

Tall, with a calm demeanor, wearing a long gray silk gown, he spoke without revealing his emotions, fully demonstrating the demeanor of a cultivated artist.

After sitting down, the reporter asked him: "I heard that Mr. Lang is going abroad recently"?

"There is such a thing," he said with a smile. "An American friend wrote to invite me to give lectures on photographic art, aimed at their P.S.A., which is an association of photographic comrades, as well as many women's groups. Recently, Gu Brand Petroleum Company and others are preparing to jointly hold an international aviation photography competition on October 5th and have also written to invite me to be a judge. However, the time to handle passport procedures is already too late, and I probably won't be able to go abroad until next spring. At that time, I also plan to bring some of my latest works to hold an exhibition."

Mr. Lang took out several letters from them to show the reporter and said that his works had already been exhibited in the United States more than thirty times.

Regarding the Chinese photography community, he said that what is lacking is organization.

"This organization is very necessary for international publicity or for connecting emotions. For example, the Japanese are smarter than us in this regard. They try their best to use photos to publicize the losses they suffered during the war, so the relief they received is much more generous than ours. On the contrary, we ourselves have very few works that play a role internationally. Instead, some foreigners have taken many photos in China to publicize for us!" He took out a Chinese painting collection published in London, which was full of works by foreign photographers.

He also told the reporter that someone in the United States recently wrote to him asking for photos of various aspects of China. He is trying to collect them and is preparing to unite the photography community to form a kind of academic group.

"Finally," Mr. Lang especially emphasized, "We cannot manufacture photographic materials ourselves, which is a very serious problem, especially in the past during the War of Resistance, we felt great pain. Therefore, I am also thinking about ways to address this, at least to see if we can ask foreign companies to help us invest and operate together, and then gradually achieve self-reliance."

When the reporter bid farewell, he kindly gave me a recent work, which was a male lion photographed in an animal enclosure, combined with the background of Mount Emei.
