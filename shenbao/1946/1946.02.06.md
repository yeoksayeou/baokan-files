### Chairman Chiang's Interview with Foreign Journalists: Wishes for Permanent Cooperation Among All Parties to Jointly Undertake National Construction; Consideration Being Given to Sending Troops to Japan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Chairman Chiang, in response to requests from several foreign journalists, granted them an audience at his official residence yesterday. A record of the questions and answers is as follows:

Question: (1) Does the Chairman believe that the recently agreed-upon reorganized government is a permanent solution for Chinese politics? After the implementation of elections, will this government still be the principle, or will a single-party cabinet be formed by the majority party?

Chairman's Answer: This is the beginning of cooperation between political parties. What form the government will take in the future must be decided by the National Assembly. I personally sincerely hope that all parties in China will cooperate permanently and jointly build the country.

Question: (2) After agreeing to reorganize the government, the Kuomintang has relinquished its vested interests. What will be the position of the Kuomintang in the country in the future?

Answer: The Kuomintang only knows its responsibility to the country and does not acknowledge having any rights. Now, distributing part of its responsibility to various parties is the beginning of fulfilling the wish of returning power to the people. After returning power to the people, the Kuomintang should still bear the responsibility of national construction together with the people of the whole country.

Question: (3) When will the government be reorganized?

Answer: After the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, the reorganization can be carried out after consultation between the government and all parties.

Question: (4) When elections are held under the new constitution, will the Chairman be a candidate for president?

Answer: I have not thought about this matter yet. I believe that after returning power to the people, I will have fulfilled my obligations to the country and the people.

Question: (5) Does the Chairman still intend to visit the United States, and when will he depart?

Answer: I have always hoped to visit the United States. If there is an opportunity, I sincerely hope to make the trip as soon as possible.

Question: (6) Six months after Japan's surrender, journalists from China, the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Communist Party have all been able to go to the nine northeastern provinces and work freely, but British and American journalists are still not allowed to enter. Is there a country other than China that should be held responsible for this?

Answer: Regarding this matter, Minister Wu has already informed you of the facts. I have no other comments.

Question: (7) In the military resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, why was it not stipulated how many divisions the Communist Party's army should be reduced to?

Answer: This matter can be decided by the Military Three-Person Committee meeting.

Question: (8) Now that military conflicts within China have ceased, does the Chairman plan to send troops to participate in the occupation of Japan?

Answer: This matter is under consideration.

Question: (9) What does the Chairman consider the most important domestic issue in China today?

Answer: I believe that transportation, education, and public health are the three most important.

Question: (10) Should the Japanese Emperor be considered a war criminal? Is the Chairman satisfied with the various policies for the occupation of Japan?

Answer: I generally agree with Marshal MacArthur's various policies and methods for controlling Japan.

Question: (11) In addition to the published Sino-Soviet Treaty, is China currently negotiating with the Soviet Union to make concessions related to economics and politics?

Answer: There are no formal negotiations between China and the Soviet Union at present. Regarding economic cooperation, local and informal discussions are ongoing from time to time, but there are no so-called concessions.

Question: (12) When will the government return to Nanjing? What will be the status of Chongqing after the return?

Answer: The government is preparing to return to the capital before May, but it will also depend on the traffic conditions to determine. After the return to the capital, Chongqing will permanently become China's auxiliary capital, and a special agency must be established to promote construction. I personally wish to come to Chongqing at least once a year.

Question: (13) After military and political consultation, can the United States Military Advisory Group proceed with its organization?

Answer: This matter will be determined by consultation between the two governments.

Question: (14) In addition to serving as an advisor to the Three-Person Committee, does Marshal Marshall have other activities in China?

Answer: Marshal Marshall's main task in coming to China this time is to assist China with its obligations to the Allied forces, and military issues are naturally at the center. However, military issues are often interconnected with other departments, so his efforts also indirectly help other areas. With Marshal Marshall's wisdom and experience, I believe he will be able to successfully complete his mission.

Question: (15) Telegrams sent from China to overseas are often delayed due to interruptions, resulting in missed opportunities. I wonder if the Chairman can urge the Ministry of Communications to make improvements?

Answer: Of course, improvements should be made. At this point, Ms. Atlee, a journalist from Reader's Digest, raised a question and asked the Chairman to answer.

Question: The government has made many concessions in this Political Consultative Conference. Why does it not pay attention to publicity and explain it in detail? Also, after the government makes these concessions, can the privately owned army of the Chinese Communist Party guarantee complete nationalization?

Answer: I have said before that the Kuomintang believes that political power is a responsibility, not a right. The government can hand over a part of its responsibility to the people and have the people bear it together. This is what the government has always sought, and I consider this one of the most gratifying things in my life. As for the nationalization of the army, it is one of the main goals of this Political Consultative Conference. The people of the whole country believe that the Communist Party will definitely achieve this in practice, without any doubt.

Commentary

### The Foreign Exchange Rate Problem

â€” Wang Xiaolai

1. The Foreign Exchange Rate Needs to Be Determined Promptly

Since the government revised the gold parity to 85,000 yuan per ounce, the black market gold price has fluctuated continuously, sometimes exceeding 100,000 yuan, and sometimes as low as 80,000 yuan. The market price of the US dollar has also fluctuated, with rumors that the exchange rate of the US dollar would be set at 1,000 yuan, causing the market price to fall accordingly. Then, rumors that it would be 1,500 yuan immediately caused the market price to rise. Therefore, the price of the US dollar has reached more than 1,800 yuan at times, and nearly 1,000 yuan at low times. Fluctuations in the Shanghai market are even more frequent. The entire gold and banknote market is almost entirely enveloped in a speculative atmosphere. Gold price rumors can affect the exchange rate, and exchange rate rumors can also affect the gold price. Both stimulate prices, interact and surge, and those engaged in foreign trade are almost unable to start. Because the exchange rate is uncertain, cost accounting for the export industry is difficult, and profit and loss calculation for the import industry is also uncertain. Trade is equal to speculation, and prudent merchants all retreat. Therefore, for the sake of developing foreign trade, the foreign exchange rate really needs to be determined promptly.

2. Current Disagreements on Exchange Rate Opinions

The reason why our country's foreign exchange rate has been delayed in being determined is because the relationship is complicated. Not only must domestic economic conditions be considered, but also the direction of the United States must be observed. From the perspective of China's own interests, opinions on whether the exchange rate is too high or too low (high exchange rate means low exchange price, low exchange rate means high exchange price) are very divergent, and the views of China and foreign countries are also different. To sum up, there are approximately the following opinions:

(1) Those who advocate a low exchange rate. Some even advocate that the legal currency should be devalued to as much as 6,000 to 7,000 legal currency per US dollar. Their meaning is to first assume that the current domestic price index is 2,000 times. The exchange price is also calculated according to the pre-war exchange rate, with one yuan of gold equivalent to 3.4 legal currency per day. According to the 2,000-fold calculation, it is equal to 6,800 yuan. US prices seem to have risen by about 40 percent. Multiplying 6,800 by 104/100 yields more than 4,800 yuan. Therefore, according to purchasing power parity, the Sino-US exchange price should be about 5,000 legal currency per US dollar. However, China's current fiscal revenue and expenditure have not yet been balanced, and the phenomenon of currency inflation may continue for some time in the near future. If the exchange rate is set at 5,000 yuan immediately, it will be revised again soon. Therefore, it is better to directly set it at 6,000 yuan or 7,000 yuan, which exceeds the current purchasing power parity by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, leaving room for currency inflation in the next six months or one year. The government must sort out its finances within six months or one year. The benefits of this method are as follows:

(1) Once and for all. Foreign exchange policy should be stable. If the exchange rate is set too high, such as not enough to balance international payments, the legal currency will inevitably be gradually devalued, which is not appropriate. Now, if it is set low, this disadvantage can be avoided.

(2) Protect domestic industry. My country's industry has always been very young, and it has made little progress during the Anti-Japanese War. British and American wartime production technology has advanced rapidly. Therefore, the cheap and high-quality British and American goods must not be able to compete with my country's industry. However, lowering the legal currency exchange rate is equivalent to increasing the price of foreign goods, which is enough to protect domestic infant industry, and the unemployment problem of workers can also be expected to be solved.

(3) Promote the export of local products. The cost of domestic products is high, and it is not easy to sell them abroad. Only by devaluing the exchange rate can the foreign currency price of domestic goods be reduced, so that there is an opportunity for mass sales. For example, if domestic tung oil is 30,000 yuan per picul, if calculated according to the 7,000 yuan exchange rate, it will only sell for 4.3 US dollars, which is enough to cover the cost. If calculated according to 1,000 yuan, it will not be done without 30 US dollars. How different is it? Therefore, setting the exchange rate low can encourage the export of local products.

(2) Those who advocate a high exchange rate. Those who advocate a high exchange rate, that is, a low exchange price, think that one US dollar is only 1,000 yuan or 1,500 yuan of legal currency. According to the current gold price and exchange price, each US dollar can only be converted into this amount. Assuming that the exchange rate of the legal currency is set high, there are three benefits:

(1) It is beneficial to economic construction. My country's industrial economy is still young, and it was almost completely destroyed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. Most of what the Japanese invaders built in my occupied areas was also destroyed after the Japanese invaders surrendered. In the future, in order to improve the living standards of the people, large-scale economic construction must be carried out. Most of the capital required for this kind of construction depends on foreign assistance. Setting the exchange rate high is naturally very beneficial to construction.

(2) Reduce the government's burden. The government borrowed a lot of British and American loans during the Anti-Japanese War, and it still needs to continue borrowing after the war. The repayment of principal and interest in the future will be very large. A high legal currency exchange rate will reduce the government's burden a lot.

(3) It is easy to get the sympathy of the United States. After this war, the unemployment problem in the United States is very serious. Therefore, it hopes that the value of each country's currency will maintain a fairly high price against the United States, so that it can absorb more American goods to maintain full employment in the United States. At the same time, the United States is very willing to lend to various countries to assist the economic development of various countries. Therefore, a high exchange rate between China and the United States is naturally supported by Americans.

(3) Those who advocate a tiered exchange rate system. The audit method is still adopted for exchange, but different levels are set according to the type of exchange required. For foreign exchange required for the import of essential goods, more foreign exchange is given according to a high exchange rate (that is, a low exchange price). If it is not an essential product, it is calculated according to a low exchange rate (that is, a high exchange price) to show restrictions. The export exchange can also be handled separately. The benefits are:

(1) Economic construction and the protection of infant industry can be taken into consideration.

(2) Restrict people's useless waste and promote the balance of international payments.

(4) Those who advocate adopting a range method. This school believes that the current stable domestic price level has not yet been established, and a balanced exchange rate that conforms to purchasing power parity cannot be determined. The exchange prices currently advocated are all guesses. If the exchange price is too low, that is, the exchange rate is too high, then the demand for exchange is greater than the supply. The government will never have huge funds to maintain the exchange rate. If the exchange price is too high, that is, the exchange rate is too low, the people's lives will be greatly threatened, which is not appropriate. Therefore, it is best not to adopt a fixed policy, but to adopt a range method. If the government believes that 1,500 yuan is appropriate, then use this as the assumed center point, and set the limits of change above and below, such as a maximum of 1,800 yuan and a minimum of 1,200 yuan. The market exchange price can be freely traded within this limit. After a considerable period of time, if the market exchange price hovers around 1,700 yuan for a long time, the assumed center point can be moved upward and the range can be reduced, such as using 1,700 as the center and 1,900 and 1,500 as its upper and lower limits. Gradually move and narrow the range in this way to achieve final stability. The benefits of this method:

(1) The government does not need to set up a huge equalization fund to maintain the exchange price.

(2) The movement of the range is not easy to attract people's attention.

(3) If it is implemented immediately now, after half a year, a balanced exchange price that conforms to the natural price level may be found. At that time, my country will join the International Monetary Fund Conference, which will be very smooth.

3. My Opinion

The above two arguments each have their own views. Without detailed statistical figures to prove it, it is difficult to judge their merits. The tiered exchange rate system gives the person in charge the power of discretionary decision, which may lead to many abuses. Therefore, I quite agree with the range method. However, when starting implementation, it is best to assume that 2,000 yuan is the range center, and the upper and lower limits are 200 yuan each, that is, between 2,200 yuan and 1,800 yuan. The gold price is also adjusted to 100,000 yuan to maintain a balanced state with the exchange, so as to prevent speculators from profiting. If the exchange price breaks through the 2,200 mark, the government should try selling foreign exchange without restrictions in the short term to suppress it. When formal importers pre-purchase exchange futures to avoid exchange risks, the government should also supply them as much as possible after verifying the transaction documents. If the suppression is ineffective, the assumed exchange price center and the gold price should be adjusted at the same time. Adjust it gradually in this way. When the market exchange price hovers around the assumed exchange price center for a long time, for example, 2,500 yuan, gradually reduce its range to 100 yuan, and finally reach 50 yuan, which can be used as the determined exchange price. If so, the foreign exchange parity is 2,500 yuan. The government buys in at 2,450 yuan and sells at 2,550 yuan, implementing unlimited sales. If this goal can be achieved within half a year, it should be the most economical and effective of the above adjustment methods. I offer a humble opinion for the consideration of experts.

### The First Batch of Soviet Agricultural Loans Has Been Granted

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Zhenjiang News, the first batch of 100 million yuan of agricultural loans granted by the Farmers Bank of China in Jiangsu Province has been granted. The second batch of loans will be continued soon, and it is uncertain whether to continue lending 100 million yuan. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is most determined to revive the industrial and agricultural sectors in the north and south of Jiangsu and restore the past rural prosperity. It will request the Central Government to provide more agricultural trade in the province to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Zhenjiang News, the cotton exported from northern Jiangsu and the Ning salt transported from Huainan in northern Jiangsu are both suffering from insufficient transportation facilities and currency chaos, and have not been smooth. At present, the Ning salt transported from the Communist military area can be freely transported and sold after verification and supplementary collection of the national tax payable. Today, the people of northern Jiangsu in Zhenjiang are pleased to see the saying of unified currency system mentioned in this newspaper.

### The Ministry of Social Affairs Plans to Strengthen Relief Undertakings

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 5th] The Ministry of Social Affairs plans to strengthen relief undertakings. Recently, the ministry has formulated a plan and is determined to reorganize charitable organizations and groups, improve and expand relief homes and training centers, and strengthen labor undertakings to relieve unemployed workers, and promote compulsory labor according to law to jointly complete local construction undertakings.

### Party Affairs in the Military After the Second Plenary Session

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang's attitude towards the abolition of party affairs in the military and the promotion of nationalization of the army is as clear as the abolition of party affairs in schools in the past. According to people in the Party Headquarters, as soon as the Second Plenary Session establishes a resolution, the Party can take action to implement the abolition without advocating it.

### Another Batch of Political Prisoners to Be Released; List Under Review and Investigation

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Chongqing News: The first list of political prisoners submitted by Yan'an after Liao Chengzhi is being reviewed and investigated by the government one by one. These political prisoners will regain their freedom in the recent week. In principle, there is no problem. However, some of them have been trained in Xifeng, Guizhou and other places, and have been released by the government for a long time, and have won honors in the Anti-Japanese War camp. It is doubtful whether they are willing to return to their "old home". Today, the Chinese people have breathed the free air of a new era. The government cannot force anyone to return to a certain political group. It was rumored in Chongqing a few days ago that the Communist Party would release Ma Fawu in exchange for Ye Ting. It is heard that the government is concerned about this move, but the government may not want to exchange prisoners of war in the way of release. The principle of the government's handling of such problems is that as long as those who talk about politics in the future can be sincere and trustworthy, and talk about law and reason, instead of resorting to riots and plunder, which only causes suffering to the people, any political prisoner can be released, and is not limited to the Communist Party.

### The Takeover of Penghu Has Been Completed

[Central News Agency, Penghu, 4th] The takeover of Penghu has now been completed, and the household registration and land registration books are complete. Under the Japanese rule, the administrative system originally had Penghu Hall, with two branch halls below, followed by street and village markets. Now the provincial government has clearly ordered to change it to county, township, and town. Penghu has inconvenient transportation, and it is planned to set up a district office in the original branch hall area, and the original tribal meeting area will be changed to "village". The village chief will be elected by the villagers. In terms of education, all schools have abolished the enslavement curriculum, and Taiwanese compatriots have been selected as principals and teachers, but the books can be completely bombed, and there are few books left. Penghu is a military stronghold. The Taiwan-Penghu Naval Commander has a branch in Penghu. During the takeover, in order to facilitate the implementation of political affairs, it was agreed with the naval authorities that administration and military affairs would be divided. Penghu is currently facing two major problems: one is food. The island is barren and the people are poor, and it is known as a barren land. Food has always been supplied by Taiwan. In the past, rice for September to March of the following year was stored before the autumn wind started. The islanders live by fishing, but almost all ships were damaged during the war, and there is also a shortage of fuel. It is hoped that the authorities will find ways to allocate funds for relief.

### Construction of 5,000 Public Housing Units in Nanjing

### Continued Rise in Tianjin Commodity Prices

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 5th] Although trade was limited during the Spring Festival, commodity prices continued to rise.

After the stock exchange reopened, Qixin stocks were priced at 2,070 yuan, an increase of over 300 yuan compared to before the holiday.

### Unified Management by the Economic Reception Committee of the Nine Northeastern Provinces. The Actions of the New Sixth Army Await Further Development of the Overall Situation

[Report from our Beiping office, 4th] The situation in the Northeast over the past week can only be described as "chaotic." According to reliable sources, our reporter has learned that the responsible authorities in the Northeast have inquired with the Soviet army about when they will complete their withdrawal. The Soviet side has not provided a specific response. There are indeed some signs of Soviet preparations for withdrawal. For example, Soviet troops around Shenyang appear to be concentrating towards the city, and there have also been movements of Soviet troops north of Shenyang. However, the official here has not been able to confirm reports in the foreign press that Soviet troops south of Shenyang have already withdrawn. The New Sixth Army has stopped its advance after reaching Goubangzi and Xinmin, and is awaiting further developments in the overall situation. Zhang Jia'ao's flight to Chongqing is reportedly due to the delayed Soviet withdrawal, which has prevented the government's original plans from progressing as expected. He has gone to seek instructions from Chairman Chiang. The number of troops under the control of the Chinese Communist Party in the Northeast is approximately 300,000 to 400,000, but their leadership consists of only three regiments from the New Fourth Army and Li Yunchang's Eighth Route Army unit from Rehe. The rest are mostly newly recruited after their arrival in the Northeast. When the Soviet army initially planned to withdraw from Changchun, Communist troops gathered in the area, appearing to be preparing to enter the city. However, due to the Soviet army's delayed withdrawal, this trend has temporarily subsided. But, if the Soviet army does withdraw, the vast Northeast still faces the possibility of widespread conflict. The official here has no knowledge of the alleged advice given by Marshall regarding the Northeast situation. The city of Dalian was originally ready for reception, but due to the Communist army's activity in the southern section of the Changchun Railway, the safety of the reception personnel has not been established. Therefore, they remain stranded in Changchun and have not departed. The situation in Yingkou remains chaotic. The Economic Relief Efforts in the Northeast are moving towards Jinzhou. Before Director Xiong Shihui leaves Beiping, he will convene a meeting of political committee members from Beiping and Tianjin to exchange views with senior figures from the Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, told reporters on the 5th that the economic reception of the nine northeastern provinces will be managed by the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Industry Reception Committee, organized by the Northeast Headquarters, with Xiong Shihui, director of the Northeast Headquarters, concurrently serving as chairman, and special commissioners stationed in the Northeast from relevant departments serving as members. The principles for receiving economic enterprises in the Northeast have already been formulated. These principles are based on the principles and experience of receiving enemy and puppet economic enterprises in North China and Central China, and the reception work will be carried out accordingly. The rural economy of the Northeast has been exploited and oppressed by the enemy and puppets for fourteen years, and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Local industries such as hot pot (using high-quality liquor) and oil mills (extracting oil from beans) are unable to compete with those operated by the enemy and puppets using new methods. Moreover, the "grain delivery" and "gratitude delivery" methods implemented by the enemy and puppets for farmers are the main reasons for the decline of the rural economy. In the future, it is imperative to give the people of the Northeast an opportunity to recuperate and thrive.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 5th] Zhang Zuoxiang, the newly appointed member of the Political Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, took a train from Tianjin to Beiping today to meet with Director Xiong Shihui, and then flew to Changchun to assume his duties.

### The Communist Party Orders Zhou Enlai to Negotiate the Northeast Issue

[United Press, Yan'an, 5th] A spokesperson for the highest political department of the Chinese Communist Party stated that although the Political Consultative Conference has concluded successfully, from the Communist Party's perspective, there are still two unresolved issues: the Northeast issue and the Communist Party's participation in the coalition government. Regarding the first issue, it is claimed that the Communist Party authorities have instructed Zhou Enlai to immediately resume negotiations with the central government to prevent renewed conflict between the Kuomintang and Communist forces in the area. Secondly, the Communist Party also wants to obtain several ministerial positions, regardless of department.

### The Mediation Team Sent to Xinxiang Achieves Agreement on Northern Henan. The Four-Point Content Was Established in Jiaozuo Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] The Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation announced that the executive team sent to Xinxiang last week has reached an agreement between the military officers of both sides. The agreement includes four points: (1) Neither side shall take offensive actions. (2) Release prisoners of war and allow them to return home on their own. (3) The Communist Party is responsible for repairing the Xinxiang-Jiyuan section of the railway under its control. (4) The section of the road west of Xinxiang, between Xiuwu (controlled by the Communist Party) and Jiaozuo (controlled by the Communist Party), must be repaired, but must not be used for provocative purposes. Unarmed civilians may use the road, but must be monitored by political officers from both sides to ensure they are indeed unarmed. Civilians may transport coal from Jiaozuo to Xinxiang, and transport other goods from Xinxiang to Jiaozuo. This agreement was established in Jiaozuo four days after the team arrived in Xinxiang (Friday), but the detailed content only arrived yesterday. The number of teams sent by the mediation department has reached fourteen, with the added teams being those sent to Dezhou and Shijiazhuang. Currently, the working areas of the teams are distributed across ten provinces.

### Yu Junji to be Appointed as Envoy

### Syria and Lebanon Demand the Withdrawal of British and French Troops. Another Dispute Arises in the Security Council. The Establishment of the Trusteeship Council is Postponed.

[Associated Press, London, 5th] Yesterday, the United Nations Security Council had a heated debate on the Greek issue, overshadowing other developments. Notable points include: (1) Syria and Lebanon appealed to the Security Council, demanding the immediate and complete withdrawal of British and French troops from their territories; (2) The Soviet Union opposed the United Nations agency's proposed budget of 25 million US dollars as excessive; (3) The Soviet Union continued to strongly oppose the Western European countries' proposal to establish a special organization to handle refugees, and condemned the tolerance of anti-Soviet political propaganda in the refugee camps in western Germany.

[United Press, London, 5th] The Chief Representative of Syria to the United Nations General Assembly, Kolay, stated today that Syria and Lebanon have requested the Security Council to order the immediate withdrawal of British and French troops from the two countries. Another dispute has thus arisen in the Council.

[Reuters, London, 5th] The United Nations Trusteeship Committee unanimously decided last night to recommend to the General Assembly that the establishment of the Trusteeship Council be postponed. "Because the governments administering trust territories must first reach an agreement before the Trusteeship Council can be established." The Trusteeship Council is the successor to the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations.

[Associated Press, London, 4th] If the current plan is adopted, the United States will pay a quarter of the United Nations' expenses. The only temporary financial plan currently being decided is to first raise an operating fund of 25 million US dollars to meet the required expenditures in the United Nations agency's first annual budget. This amount will be borne jointly by 51 countries, with the United States contributing 6.25 million US dollars and China contributing 1.625 million US dollars.

### Stalemate on the Greek Issue, Verbal Battle Between Britain and the Soviet Union Intensifies. Bevin Demands a Clear Judgement on Britain's Actions. The Soviet Side Insists on the Unconditional Withdrawal of British Troops

[Central News Agency, London, 4th, Associated Press] The Security Council adjourned today after seven hours of debate. The Soviet representative attempted to use the veto power of the five permanent members for the first time during the meeting. When Chairman Makin proposed that the presence of British troops in Greece did not threaten peace, but that the Security Council should take note of the fact that the United States had promised to swiftly withdraw British troops from Greece, the chief Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, immediately stood up and declared that he would defeat the motion, stating: "We need the unanimous vote of the five permanent members. The Security Council cannot vote on this motion because the Soviet Union opposes it."

[Reuters, London, 5th] When the United Nations Security Council met yesterday afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Bevin firmly demanded "a clear judgement on Britain's actions." The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, insisted on the "unconditional withdrawal" of British troops from Greece, with each side refusing to yield to the other. After a lengthy debate, the representatives failed to reach a compromise solution on the Greek issue between the opinions of Britain and the Soviet Union. The meeting adjourned at 9:40 PM and was scheduled to reconvene at 10:30 PM tonight.

Soviet Side Launches Fierce Counterattack

At the afternoon meeting yesterday, Vyshinsky launched a fierce counterattack against Bevin, stating, "I can state clearly that the Soviet delegation considers the words of Bevin on February 1, 1946, to be the worst. His claim that Moscow's propaganda threatens peace has absolutely no basis. Moreover, does he believe that saying this is in harmony with the friendship between the two countries? The Soviet delegation felt uneasy when the British representative suddenly made this statement. The chill of past events invaded, and we could think of the shadows that plagued our two countries in the past. The Moscow propaganda song is an old song. In 1921, Lord Curzon (then British Foreign Secretary) made such accusations and even issued an ultimatum. However, we can easily explain that Lord Curzon's entire plan failed. Between 1926 and 1927, British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain followed Curzon's example and sent a letter to the Soviet government regarding so-called anti-British propaganda in Moscow. Although the results of these accusations were failures, their traces remain, which is extremely dangerous. When Bevin heard our friendly warning regarding the situation in Greece, he immediately used the term Moscow propaganda. Our description of the inhumanity and terror in Greece is still called Moscow propaganda. Our mention of the British troops remaining in Greece being used by adventurers and a majority of reactionaries to resist the United Nations is also referred to as propaganda. Bevin asked the Security Council to clearly judge whether the British government is endangering world peace in Greece. The Soviet delegation has answered this question and now reaffirms that British interference in Greek internal affairs has caused a situation that, in fact, endangers international peace. The presence of British troops in Greece is, in fact, a tool for suppressing the country's domestic affairs, creating a particularly tense situation that has serious consequences not only for the Greek people but also for international peace." Vyshinsky spoke for one hour and fifteen minutes, concluding by reiterating the Soviet Union's demand for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of British troops from Greece.

Britain Refutes Soviet Accusations

After Vyshinsky's speech, Bevin replied in a low and weary tone, at 5 PM. Bevin refuted all accusations of being unfriendly to the Soviet Union, stating that no one can say that he is unfriendly to the Soviet Union, because when the Soviet Union had few friends in Britain, he did his best to help the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky's speech refuted each point in the statement he made on Friday in detail. He stated that the Soviet Union's memorandum on Greece last July did not contain any attacks on Britain. He also quoted the words of several members of the British Parliament who agreed with the Soviet view. It should be known that it is not common in Britain to only state one side of any issue. He had ordered his staff to send a copy of the detailed report of the British Parliament's debate on Greece to Vyshinsky. Bevin also recalled: "Regarding the agreement between France, the United States, and Britain to supervise the Greek elections, Marshal Stalin expressed complete trust in British policy. It is interesting that Vyshinsky insists on this point today, because the Soviet government has never deeply felt about this matter, or has expressed trust in our actions. I have never denied that the Greek left-wing movement did good work during the war of resistance. What surprised me was that after the defeat of Germany, they suddenly stopped expelling the Germans from Greece and instead adopted a policy of seizing power. Britain's concern for Greece is not due to power politics or economic interests. The world should remember that from 1940 to 1941, Britain's wartime allies, besides the United Kingdom, were only the Greeks, who were not afraid of the enemy's attack. As for what other countries did, I would like to leave it to the world to guess." Bevin finally reiterated his firm demand and strongly urged the Security Council to clearly judge whether the British troops in Greece were protecting a people.

Statement by the Greek Representative

[Central News Agency, London, 4th Dispatch] The Greek representative, Attinaidis, issued a statement at the Security Council meeting this afternoon, refuting accusations by other countries that Greece might pose a threat to its neighbors. It is claimed that Greece has been invaded by Bulgaria three times, and should not be accused of threatening its neighbors. In fact, we have been threatened by several of our neighbors. Regarding the question of whether the British troops stationed in Greece pose a threat to peace, he said, "I believe this should first be answered by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. As for us, what I can explain is that we welcomed the arrival of British troops in Greece. The arrival of British troops in Greece was at the request of successive Greek governments. The arrival of British troops facilitated the liberation of Greece. Afterwards, British troops remained stationed in Greece. Unfortunately, a civil war broke out. At this time, it was fortunate that British troops were stationed in Greece. The Greek people will hold elections on March 31, at which time who will govern the country can be decided democratically."

I Agree with the US Proposal

[Reuters, London, 5th] The representatives of China and France both expressed support for Stettinius's suggestion that the Security Council should not interfere in the Greek incident. Chinese representative Gu Weijun believes that the Security Council should state that Greece can hold elections as soon as possible to make the withdrawal of British troops possible, but the Security Council should not take any action. Chairman Makin also agreed with Stettinius's suggestion, advocating that no intervention action should be taken. The Polish representative also said, "If the British ask whether the presence of British troops in Greece endangers world peace, I will answer 'Yes'." After the Council briefly discussed the conditions of the American "resolution," Soviet representative Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation agreed to issue a declaration stating that since the British side has announced that British troops should withdraw as soon as possible, the Council believes that the issue has come to an end. However, British representative Bevin opposed this proposal, advocating for a clear declaration stating that the presence of British troops in Greece does not endanger international peace. If this could be a preceding resolution, he agreed not to take any further action, but if he acted according to Vyshinsky's words, it would be tantamount to admitting that the Soviet Union's complaint was justified. However, Bevin has agreed to withdraw British troops after discussions by the Security Council. Bevin said he would not be so naive as to do this. At 7:55 PM, after five hours of debate, the Security Council adjourned for ten minutes to organize various resolutions, but ultimately failed to reach an agreement on the various resolutions.

[Central News Agency, London, 4th Dispatch] Our representative Gu Weijun spoke about the Greek issue at the Security Council meeting this afternoon, first saying that China sincerely respects and sympathizes with Greece's heroic resistance against the Nazi army from 1937 to 1945. He then stated: "China's attitude towards this issue discussed by the Security Council is that it hopes that it will not be transformed into a cause that damages goodwill and understanding between countries. China also hopes that all countries will always abide by the United Nations Charter. China is one of the Security Council's directors, and our delegation hopes to assist this important United Nations agency in carrying out its important tasks."

### Vincent Introduces Bill in the House to Help China Build a Navy, Suggesting the Transfer of Ships to China

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, introduced a bill today to "assist China in expanding its naval equipment," which appears to be a new type of Lend-Lease Act (including personnel and equipment). However, Vincent declined to comment until the committee meets tomorrow. The bill would authorize the US President to provide China with "naval services, training programs, and technical guidance as he deems appropriate," and would be able to sell, lease, donate, or transfer naval vessels (except battleships), destroyers, escort ships, and floating dry docks suitable for destroyer-class vessels to China. At the same time, it would also authorize the US President, at the request of China, to send US Navy personnel to assist China in handling naval affairs.

### Military Staff Committee Nominates Chairman

British Representative Sir Moyers Selected

### US Supreme Court Supports Original Verdict, Yamashita's Appeal Rejected, Final Fate in MacArthur's Hands

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The US Federal Supreme Court, by a vote of six to two, upheld the US Military Tribunal's verdict that Yamashita Tomoyuki, former commander of the Japanese forces in the Philippines, should be sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes. The Supreme Court has refused to intervene and has rejected Yamashita's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court's decision has effectively overturned Yamashita's argument regarding the legal status of the US Military Tribunal after the end of the war. Chief Justice Stone of the Supreme Court, representing the majority opinion, stated: "The military authorities' trial was lawful, because before the peace treaty, the power to prosecute cases of violation of the laws of war did not belong to the courts, but was in the hands of the government and political institutions. And this prosecutorial power itself may be bound by the terms of the peace treaty, as was the case with Japan's surrender." The Supreme Court overturned Yamashita's claim that he was not responsible for the actions of his subordinates, and ruled that the purpose of the laws of war is to protect civilians and prisoners of war from violence. If the commander of an invading army fails to take reasonable measures to protect civilians and prisoners of war and can be innocent, then the laws of war will be greatly ineffective.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] A spokesman for MacArthur stated this morning that the authority to review the Yamashita case now rests with MacArthur. MacArthur's decision will be his final decision. Whether to execute him or commute the sentence will be decided by MacArthur.

### Mass Grave Discovered in Silesia, 190,000 People Massacred

[Reuters, London, 5th] Moscow Radio: Multiple mass graves have been discovered in the Lanchedorf area near Opole in Silesia, some as deep as 30 feet or more, containing the bodies of no fewer than 190,000 Russian, French, British, and Polish prisoners of war. A committee jointly formed by the Polish government and Red Army representatives to investigate the German massacre has determined that the German army detained over 200,000 Allied prisoners of war in the Lanchedorf concentration camp, most of whom were Russians and Poles. However, when the Soviet army occupied the area, only 800 prisoners remained in the camp. The bodies in the mass graves were stacked in layers of ten to twelve. The medical team determined that some of the bodies had been shot, while others died from exhaustion, disease, or unbearable torture. The evidence related to this discovery has been compiled and submitted to the Nuremberg Military Tribunal. The bodies have been reburied, and many people participated in the funeral. The authorities plan to build a monument on the site to commemorate and never forget.

### New Siamese Cabinet: Strong Lineup, Closer Sino-Siamese Relations Expected

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 3rd dispatch] The key members of the new cabinet appointed by the King of Siam, headed by Prime Minister Apaiwong, all have decades of experience in politics. Pramoj serves as the Foreign Minister, Watcharat as the Finance Minister, and Sri Sanan as the Interior Minister. Among Siam's current priorities, foreign affairs and finance take precedence, hence the selection of Pramoj and Watcharat for these positions. Pramoj hopes to use his ability to promote relations between Siam and the UK and the US to negotiate with France for the return of the three provinces obtained from Vietnam in 1941. He will also be responsible for implementing the terms of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty and revising foreign policy to bring Siam into the international community. During his short term as Prime Minister, he was most liked by our people, especially after the successful signing of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty. With him taking up the new position of Foreign Minister, closer friendly relations between China and Siam are expected. The biggest difficulty faced by the new cabinet is the task of financial reconstruction. Finance Minister Watcharat is a wise statesman and a capable diplomat. He has Chinese ancestry and is one of the longest-serving officials in the Siamese government. Overseas Chinese are very concerned about the selection of the Siamese Interior Minister, as his duties will affect the welfare of the overseas Chinese community. The appointment of Sri Sanan as Interior Minister is deeply welcomed by the overseas Chinese.

### Isogai Surrenders to Prison, Nomura and Kurusu Not Listed as War Criminals

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Lieutenant General Isogai Kensuke, former Governor of Hong Kong, who was ordered to be arrested by MacArthur on the 19th of last month on suspicion of war crimes, surrendered to Sugamo Prison today. Isogai is 62 years old and was formerly the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Kurusu and Nomura, two Japanese envoys of false peace, were in Washington negotiating when the Pearl Harbor incident occurred, and were suspected of participating in a war conspiracy, but they insisted that they were deceived by the militarists. According to sources close to the Allied Headquarters, after investigation, no evidence of their involvement in a war conspiracy was found, so they will not be indicted as war criminals.

Infant Corpses Murdered by Japanese Troops Discovered: At No. 9, Lane 1 of 50 Shanghai Road in this city, the Japanese troops built a (Army Club) after the incident. It is currently being used by the 2nd Field Hospital of the 6th Naval Warfare Team of the US Navy. The building has six floors, with the bottom floor deeply buried underground and unused. On the 31st of last month, when carpenters were sent to repair it, they suddenly discovered two jars containing the corpses of our compatriots' infants in the cellar, two corpses in one jar and four corpses in the other. They immediately notified the police station, and the police were dispatched to lift the jars out. The jars were about two feet high, covered with wooden lids. The infants in the jars were three or four years old at the oldest and only a few months old at the youngest. Each corpse had been dissected, the eyes dug out, and the heart extracted, and soaked in potion, so they had not rotted. Wooden tags were attached to each corpse, numbered. From this, it can be inferred that there may be more than six infant corpses. A continued search is underway. The recovered infant corpses have been photographed by the police and posted for claiming. The inhumanity of the Japanese troops can be seen from this.

### Dikes on Both Banks of the Huangpu River Collapsed, Municipal Government Plans to Repair, Work Relief Scheduled to Start Within the Week

[Report] The dikes on both sides of the Huangpu River in this city, from Cao'an Temple in Pudong to Huangjia Bay, and from Qiujiang Bridge in Puxi to the boundary of Yangshan County, have a total length of approximately 30 kilometers. They have not been repaired for seven or eight years, and many places have collapsed, greatly affecting farmland and houses. After investigation by the Seawall Engineering Team of the Municipal Works Bureau, the construction steps have been determined. However, the investigation shows that repairing according to the regulations will cost 1,140,000,000 yuan. If ordinary repairs can be carried out to prevent seawater from flooding in summer and autumn, it will cost 100,000,000 yuan. This plan has been approved by the municipal government after being submitted by the bureau. However, due to the city's financial difficulties, the monthly allocation of funds still differs from the budget. Therefore, the Works Bureau has applied to the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for the distribution of workers' flour, adopting a method of half labor costs and half flour. If building materials can be provided free of charge, it will further accelerate the work. In addition, it is planned to adopt a work-for-relief system and a conscription method to strengthen manpower. The bureau has been deploying construction along the dikes since the day before yesterday and has also requested the assistance and cooperation of relevant district offices, town offices, police sub-bureaus, and local people. If everything can be resolved smoothly, the project can begin within a week.

### General Wedemeyer Sends Letter of Thanks to Mayor Qian

General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces in China, and Brigadier General Calloway, Acting Chief of Staff of the US Armed Forces in China, sent letters to Mayor Qian yesterday, expressing their gratitude for the Allied reception held by twelve groups, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and local associations, at the Paramount Ballroom on January 20. The original text stated briefly: During this World War, the soldiers of our two countries fought side by side, resolutely and unyieldingly, against those who seized our freedom. Therefore, the relationship between China and the United States has become closer.

The good cooperative spirit shown by the Chinese and American armies in the China Theater is not only an essential factor for the victory in this war but also greatly contributes to the maintenance of future security in the Far East, and it is worthy of cherishing. In this transition from war to peace, the hidden reefs and counter-currents that can damage the solid friendship between domestic and international relations can be encountered everywhere. If we want to avoid the recurrence of the tragic disasters of war, we must strive to seek mutual understanding and

peaceful compromise

, and make the same efforts as we did in fighting the aggressors in the past few months. True understanding between the peoples of the world can only be achieved by seeking the truth with an indomitable spirit. If all countries in the world cannot be patient and eliminate prejudices, then true friendship will not be possible. Your Mayor has always had a warm enthusiasm for the friendship and understanding between our two nations of China and the United States, which is to be congratulated. Thank you for your kindness to me and my comrades, and I am writing this letter to express my sincere gratitude.

### "Japan's Spy" Author Murdered in Manila

It is said that he was killed during the early period of the Japanese occupation.

### Whether in Power or in Opposition, Everyone Must Work Together: Huang Yanpei Talks to Reporters

[Report] Just after the Political Consultative Conference closed, Mr. Huang Yanpei, the Political Consultative Conference representative and protagonist of the Democratic League, flew to Shanghai. In order to comfort the elders and brothers of his hometown and to clearly explain the achievements of the Political Consultative Conference to the public, he invited reporters from various newspapers to a symposium at the China Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road yesterday afternoon.

Flash Introduction

Although there was a drizzling rain and only a cup of tea, the grand occasion and mood were better than any reception. The small room was crowded with people, and those without seats stood and listened, stood and wrote, which showed the great concern of the people for national affairs. Mr. Huang had a round face and a cheerful smile. He suggested that he first call the names on the list of reporters who signed in because he wanted to get to know a new group of friends. So, as if he were in class, he called a name, and a reporter stood up and greeted him. I doubt if he could remember thirty or forty unfamiliar names and faces.

Starting from Scratch

At the beginning of the conversation, he first mentioned the "painful victory" because it was exchanged for the lives of more than five million soldiers, and it was clear that the people had not yet truly tasted the fruits of victory. But he said: In any case, we have always won. Heaven has not abandoned China, and we still have today. We must always start from scratch, and everyone must do it. If we do it step by step, we will surely have a day of success.

Unity in Government and Opposition

He said that the atmosphere was harmonious during the 22 days of the Political Consultative Conference, and the military conflicts had all stopped. The day before he left, he first telegraphed Wang Ruofei, who represented the Communist Party of China, to be responsible for replying that all conflicts had stopped nationwide. Then Shao Lizi came to see him off and also said that the military conflicts had indeed completely stopped. This was the first good news he brought to Shanghai and the recovered areas. Regarding the demand for the protection of the people's basic freedoms, the government has revised or abolished the old laws separately, and the "Habeas Corpus Act" promulgated in the 24th year will be implemented immediately. He believes that these will be obtained soon. The release of political prisoners has also been ordered by the government to various places, and I think it is also in sight. The outlines of all major matters of military reorganization and army building have been agreed upon, but they are waiting for implementation. Therefore, in the future, whether in power or in opposition, it is not a matter of talking, but a period of personally doing things.

Another Magic Trick

Someone asked: Will there be difficulties in implementing the two things of abolishing the border governments and nationalizing the army? Mr. Huang answered very well. He said: We have already overcome so many difficulties. We cannot say that these two things are without difficulties, but under the situation of the nationwide demand for unity, even if there are difficulties, they will surely be completed smoothly. Asked: Who will be the Premier of the Executive Yuan? Answer: It will not be possible to be in the Executive Yuan until after the reorganization of the National Government. He also reported: The Democratic Daily was published in Chongqing on February 1. The work of the China Vocational Education Society is the same as before, but the magic trick will be different.

Finally, he said that he would return to Chongqing within the month to attend the Constitution Draft Review Committee and the Political Participation Council to be convened next month. The reporters asked him to bring more news to us when he comes to Shanghai next time. The conversation ended in laughter.

### Sawada Shigeru, a Prisoner of War, Returns to Shanghai

According to the US Military Headquarters in the China Theater: Two Japanese generals, the main perpetrators of the massacre of three airmen under General Doolittle, have been transferred to Shanghai for trial. The two main perpetrators are Sawada Shigeru, former commander of the 12th Japanese Army in the Shanghai area, and Wakao, a Japanese army captain who participated in sentencing the American airmen to death. Accompanying these two main perpetrators was Major Doyle of the US Military Justice Department. Major Doyle recently flew to Tokyo and found the two main perpetrators in a Japanese prison. He returned them to this place this morning and they were imprisoned in the Ward Road Prison along with the other perpetrators involved in the case.

The US Military Headquarters in the China Theater announced today that 18 Japanese officers who committed atrocities against American airmen in Hankou will be interrogated by the US Military Commission. The Commission rejected the defendants' lawyers' request to review the evidence. The Commission ruled favorably on the defendants' lawyers' request at the hearing on Friday at the Ward Road Prison, but the prosecutor requested a retrial of the request, which was held this morning. The case will continue on February 11. It was also announced that two of the defendants are said to have recently died and are currently under investigation.

### Zhongfu Bank Ordered to Be Liquidated; Several Other Collaborating Banks Still Exist; Orders for Closure and Liquidation Will Be Issued Separately

[Our News] Zhongfu Bank of this city received an order from the Ministry of Finance the day before yesterday, instructing it to cease operations and liquidate immediately. A reporter interviewed a senior official of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, who stated: If any banks or money shops in the recovered areas are found to have engaged in collaborationist activities, they will be ordered to cease operations and liquidate separately. Several such institutions have been found to have solid evidence of collaboration. In addition to Zhongfu Bank, which has already been ordered to cease operations by the Ministry, the names of the other institutions cannot be disclosed before formal orders are issued by the Ministry. Zhongfu Bank was established in the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916), with its general management office initially located in Tianjin and later moved to Shanghai. It has one branch in this city and branches in Hankou and Beiping. According to a staff member of the bank, it is still unclear whether the bank's business was implicated due to personnel holding positions in the puppet regime. It is said that since the order to cease operations and liquidate, the bank has temporarily suspended receipts and payments, and everything must wait for the appointment of the liquidator before it can be handled.

### Trial of Traitors: Life Imprisonment for Secret Agent

[Our News] Yesterday, the Criminal Division of the High Court held several trials for cases of treason. In the morning, Judge Zhu Zonghai interrogated Wang Jinfa. Wang opened the Dongya Automobile Company on Dongchang Road in Pudong. In order to protect his business, he entrusted Ito, a Japanese national, to introduce him to the enemy's military police and served as a secret agent. He used his power to intimidate travelers. However, Wang denied this in court yesterday. After consulting with twelve witnesses, Judge Zhu ordered a postponement for further questioning.

In the afternoon, the collegiate panel continued to try Dong Jin and Gan Rangyun. Dong was a major secretary in the Shanghai office of the 37th Division of the puppet army. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution based on the regulations for punishing traitors. Dong argued that the division had revolted before the victory and was incorporated into the Third War Zone. The court ordered a judgment to be delivered on the afternoon of the 12th.

Gan Rangyun, also known as Gan Weilu, is 72 years old. His father was British and his mother was Cantonese. In the spring of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), he served as a senior member of the puppet Legislative Yuan, and resigned at the end of the 31st year (1942). He founded the publication "Voice of New China," advocating the rejection of Britain and the United States. After the victory, the British Naval Office in Shanghai reported him to the city policeå±€, and he was arrested and transferred to the court. The case had been tried once before. At the hearing yesterday, Gan claimed that he had not formally obtained Chinese nationality, and he hired lawyers Tang Huaiqun and Qin Shouzhang to argue that, due to his nationality, the prosecution for the crime of treason based on "plotting to resist one's own country" was inappropriate. The court ordered a judgment to be delivered on the afternoon of the 12th.

Two traitors were also sentenced yesterday: (1) Wu Yimin, a secret agent of the enemy's Shanghai East Military Police, was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life; (2) Xu Xing, a member of the Xinåº„ puppet inspection station, was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for eight years.

Zhu Guilin of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau presided over the mediation. However, because the management representatives were not fully authorized, they could not provide concrete answers to the conditions and issues raised by the labor side, and the negotiations made no progress. At 4:00 PM, mediation continued. First, the issue of year-end bonuses was discussed. The labor side demanded 35,000 yuan per person, while the management side only agreed to 15,000 yuan, a significant difference.

Commercial News

### Initial Rise Followed by Fall; Gold Market Transactions Quiet; More than 100,000 Less Than on New Year's Eve

During the market closure, it was said that a few transactions called for prices as high as 1.3 million or more. Yesterday, the market opened with an initial rise, with prices called above 1.25 million. There was supply but no demand. The price of gold in the capital (Chongqing) was at 930,000. Jewelry stores continued their New Year's holiday. Under this twofold pressure, many long positions from the previous year were liquidated, causing the official market opening to fall back to 1.17 million. After opening, it continued to fall to 1.13 million. At this time, speculative funds saw the low price and bought in, causing it to rise again to 1.19 million. Large investors took out gold to buy currency, and securities firms also took out gold to buy stocks. The rising trend was blocked, and small investors also followed suit and liquidated. With prices in a situation of either advancing or retreating, the situation deteriorated, and at noon, prices gradually fell to 1.095 million.

The noon closing was 1,600 yuan. This was entirely due to securities firms and money shops engaging in arbitrage. As a result, the arbitrage spread narrowed slightly from 700 yuan per ten taels to around 685 yuan. Ultimately, it fell 80 yuan compared to New Year's Eve. Hong Kong dollars were initially firm but then weakened. Old currency retreated slightly from a high price of 260 yuan to around 245 yuan. New currency retreated from 75 yuan to 73 yuan.

Yong Yarn fell below the 2,000 yuan level, Meiya fell to 1,600, and Jingfu retreated from 103 yuan to below 95 yuan. Large investors took out gold to buy stocks, and the market briefly turned bullish, with Yong Yarn rebounding to 2,150 yuan, Meiya to 1,650 yuan, and Jingfu to above 105 yuan. However, long positions from the previous year were closed one after another, gold and currency weakened, and the environment lacked stimulation. After this, prices gradually fell, with the lowest prices at noon. The noon closing prices were all low. Compared to New Year's Eve, Yong Yarn fell by 200 yuan, Meiya by 170, Xinho by 85 yuan, Jingfu by 10 yuan, Xinguang by 9 yuan, and Qinxing by 6 yuan.

### Disposal of Robbed Yarn and Cloth Sparks Panic Among Industry Members; Joint Petitions to Authorities to Stop It

During the Lunar New Year holiday, the three associations of yarn, cloth, dyeing, and weaving in this city continued to deliberate separately and appeal in all directions regarding their request to the government for the return of the remaining yarn and cloth robbed by the enemy and puppet regimes. Recently, member factories of the Dyeing and Weaving Association reported that the line bills issued by the former puppet Business Unified Association had been transferred by the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region to the China Textile Construction Company. The association and others were greatly alarmed. In addition to petitioning the Executive Yuan to issue a prompt instruction, they jointly petitioned the National Political Consultative Conference and the Control Yuan in Chongqing, detailing the beginning and end of the robbery and requesting that the Disposal Bureau be instructed to stop it promptly based on legal principles and commercial realities.

### Company Registration in Recovered Areas: Handling Measures to Be Announced

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously stated that companies, banks, money shops, trust companies, and other industries in Shanghai, in addition to their original legal tender capital, were forced to increase their capital by puppet organizations during the occupation, with all income being received in puppet currency. Since the puppet currency was converted to legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1, it was uncertain whether this subsequently increased puppet currency capital and all claims and debts would be repaid or recovered at a rate of 200 to 1, or whether other measures would be determined. After submitting two telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on October 31st and December 13th of last year to request instructions, they received a response from the Ministry of Economic Affairs on January 23rd of this year, Document No. 21338 of the 35th Yu Shang: "Both telegrams have been noted. Regarding the handling of puppet currency capital within companies, this Ministry has drafted measures for the registration and handling of various companies in the recovered areas, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then submitted them to the Supreme National Defense Council for record. The measures will be announced and implemented after approval, and you should handle the matter accordingly after the measures are announced."

Spring and Autumn

### Lamp

â€” Meizi

I love lamps, because they are light in the darkness.

Especially that street lamp at the dark crossroads, I'm afraid that apart from the lighthouse in the ocean, no other light is more valuable and respectable; the revolving lantern of the Lantern Festival is indeed lovely, but it only wins the joyful jumping of children; the colored lanterns of grand banquets are beautiful, but they only decorate the charming scenery for wealthy gentlemen and ladies. However, that street lamp at the crossroads is great, although its light is very weak, half-bright and half-dim, trembling slightly in the cold wind of the cold night...

Every day, when it lights up, families nearby without clocks know that it is time to prepare dinner.

The postman, after delivering the last batch of letters for the day, can still clearly recognize the house numbers.

The old man leaning on his cane saves the money for a taxi, the careless child won't fall into the mud pit or next to the garbage, can the peddler selling fried ginkgo use this vague bit of light to clearly see if the person eating the protein fruit has given him one banknote less? Calculate how much income he has made today?

Travelers on the road all benefit from its grace. It tells you: What road is in front? What road is behind? Which way is to the left? Which way is to the right?

It illuminates the way home for those who have families, and the homeless wanderer also has a shadow by his side, so he doesn't feel lonely...

Silently praising this dim, half-bright, half-dim street lamp, after it goes out each time.

### Random Thoughts on the Spring Festival

â€” Shi Jimei

I am very fond of this so-called Spring Festival, which is also the Lunar New Year, because after the golden days of youth have flown by, no one can avoid lamenting that time flies like water and life is like a dream. They wish that the post-war years would slow down day by day, allowing them to be younger for a little longer. The solar calendar was changed to the national calendar, so people would unknowingly add a year to their age a month earlier. Who would want to calculate it that way? Fortunately, the lunar calendar has not been completely abolished, so this year that must be added can be temporarily postponed. Therefore, this limited period of "postponement" is particularly precious and makes people reluctant to part with it. These few days, the surplus on the profit and loss statement in the stores is a "bonus" for people's youth!

The twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month is the day to "send off the Kitchen God." The so-called "sending off the Kitchen God" is to send the Kitchen God to heaven. This custom exists in all regions, but the rituals are not necessarily the same. However, one thing is the same: the Kitchen God who is sent off is expected to "speak good words in heaven and ensure peace in the world below." Some places even smear some Kitchen God candy on the Kitchen God's mouth, hoping that he will say a few sweet words in heaven, generally instructing him to conceal evil and promote good. Therefore, we feel that this custom is too undemocratic. Today, the habit of "sending off the Kitchen God" seems to be less popular than in the past. Should we be happy about the gradual development of people's intelligence? No, what is sad is that the act of "sending off the Kitchen God" is now gradually being practiced on living people.

Daffodils, sacred bamboo, wintersweet, and pine and cypress branches are almost everywhere for sale. Pine and cypress represent longevity, wintersweet represents the five blessings blossoming, and I forgot what daffodils and sacred bamboo symbolize, but anyway, there are only auspicious words. People buy them all as decorations for the New Year to seek good luck, and even families who usually don't buy flowers all year round make an exception. If the spirits of the flowers knew, wouldn't they be heartbroken? In order not to compete with vulgar peaches and plums, they bloom in this freezing cold winter, who would have known that they would still be picked and used to decorate the bright red and green New Year?

These days should be the busiest time for housewives (mainly housewives, who direct the rest of the family). Purchasing New Year's goods, making New Year's snacks, New Year's offerings, sending New Year's gifts, planning the finances, and also the year-end cleaning. Almost the latest they can start getting busy is from the day of "sending off the Kitchen God," and they are still in a flurry until New Year's Eve. They only become idle on the first day of the New Year, and when they are idle, they are very idle. The only serious things are paying New Year's greetings and receiving New Year's greetings, and the rest is all play, all kinds of play, for many days in a row. So my view of the New Year is this: in the days before New Year's Eve, everyone is desperately busy, and in the days after New Year's Day, everyone is extremely idle. That's what the New Year is.

This year's New Year is filled with the sound of firecrackers celebrating peace. There are two types of people who set off firecrackers: one is still children, as in previous years, and the other is our allied American soldiers.

Speaking of firecrackers, even third-graders know that they are one of the three great inventions of ancient China. Our ancestors are indeed worthy of pride. What is shameful is that people have now invented the atomic bomb, but their descendants have not made much progress. Thinking of this, how can one not be saddened for the ancient civilization?

The most interesting thing is the New Year's Eve candle. In Shanghai, the word "candle" represents a certain typical person, and usually no one likes to accept this unlovable term. In fact, I have a surprising fondness for candles. If I were to describe it in personified terms, I would say that it has the temperament of a poet, the aspirations of a hero, and the martyrdom spirit of a religious person who sacrifices himself for the masses. The New Year's Eve candle is especially different from usual. If I were a candle, I would hope that people would choose me for the purpose of staying up late. The New Year's Eve candle is happier than the birthday candle on a birthday cake or the wedding candle in a bridal chamber, because I can also personally experience the end of everything old and the beginning of something new. The lifespan of other candles is only a few hours at most, but its one night is equal to two years. The New Year's Eve candle is bright in time and dies in time.

Older people like to say, "The New Year is for the children!" This statement seems unreasonable but actually makes a lot of sense. Although everyone, old and young, grows a year older starting from the first day of the New Year, which seems to prove that the New Year is for everyone, in fact, children want to know more new and exciting things and look forward to growing up quickly, so they are very happy to add a year to their age. But older people worry about the approach of old age, so they only go through the motions for this year that cannot be avoided and have no interest in it. There is a Western saying, "Life is a bridge from cradle to grave." The journey of this bridge is long but limited. Every year that passes takes them further away from the cradle and closer to the grave. How can you expect them to be enthusiastic? The rosy cheeks in the mirror, the white hair on the temples, youth cannot be bought for a thousand pieces of gold, youth cannot be bought for a thousand pieces of gold! So it is said, "The New Year is for the children!" Look, those children are staring with their round, dark, and bright eyes, playing with their beloved revolving lantern! Seeing that the ancient beauty who just passed by has turned out again, the child's small mouth opens and smiles innocently. That smile seems familiar. Yes, it's yourself, ten years ago? Twenty years ago? Also playing with a revolving lantern. Ah! How quickly the days pass, just in the blink of an eye, like the light turn of the figures on the revolving lantern... But the beauties on the lantern are always so young, and that general never gets old, only the child playing with the revolving lantern is no longer the same as before. Don't you feel melancholy? On that night of the Lantern Festival with bright lights, the New Year is for the children, the beautiful scenery is all for the children, youth cannot be bought for a thousand pieces of gold. How can we not be more careful, more cautious, more cherish, and walk step by step across the bridge of our lives?

### New Year

â€” Yu Hong

For many years, I have been somewhat afraid of the New Year, but I have a lot of longing for the New Years to come, because for several years I have been a guest alone, and seeing the reunions of others in a foreign land is a kind of embarrassing temptation. What I hope for is a happy victory in the future, with my family who are scattered in the mountain cities of the remote border returning. Although it is a dream, it has a surreal expectation.

After the victory, I like to listen to the broadcasters on the radio, patiently enduring the hoarse static noise, knowing that there will not necessarily be any news about my own people, but hoping to find some signs of the mountain city in it.

Each time after listening to the broadcasters, I am delighted, and everyone repeats:

"We are all well and can rush home for the New Year."

In these simple words, you can read how much the distant guests who are scattered in the mountain cities yearn for their long-separated hometown. People are reluctant to part with the traditional old year, because they are reluctant to part with this warm habit. I will never criticize this habit. Every year, I endure the embarrassment and look forward to the victory in the coming year.

Haven't you seen? After Christmas, the expeditionary troops in foreign lands started a wave of returning home? They are the same, they yearn too much for their warm habits. If the days of this habit come late, then this wave will inevitably be delayed. In order to match my own aspirations, I have this confidence.

But this year I am disappointed, and I am even more afraid of this year's Lunar New Year. Many demanding hands are reaching out, and I have no money. I shouldn't be so poor, but I am very poor. A servant in one place asked me:

"Sir, have you given the cigarette money yet?"

During the New Year, "gentlemen" have the obligation to give cigarette money. For a traveler who is a guest alone, if you have not avoided worldly worries, this cigarette money is a huge expense. But my own cigarettes have become worse and worse year by year. A friend who works in a newspaper office told me:

"I use one-fifth of my salary to pay the New Year's reward to the newspaper office's tea boy!"

I completely understand that he is not lying, and I believe that soon the other four-fifths of his salary will also be paid for cigarette money, because he is also a lonely person.

I am willing to do these things, if with this money I can buy the longed-for warmth. No, not at all. In the mountain city, they are sighing and chanting "It is difficult to leave Shu." Someone sent a few sparse words:

"It is difficult to predict when we can leave Shu. It depends on the means of transportation."

A newspaper published: The China Literary and Art Circles Association will purchase wooden boats to go down the river, and Mao Dun and his wife will also take this boat back to Shanghai, with a large headline attached:

"Writers take a risk and take a wooden boat east!"

The New Year is another name for reunion. It is even more embarrassing if you cannot spend the New Year at home. Looking at my family in the mountain city, I think:

"It's been another year, let's see each other next year!"

### Companion

â€” Xiao Hua

That year, when I was studying in a mountain city, by chance, I met Lei. We quickly became good friends. We often went in and out together. If one of us temporarily left for some reason, the other would feel unbearably lonely.

Even we ourselves were sometimes surprised. How could we get along so well? In theory, whether measured from temperament or hobby, there were obvious differences between us. We also lived in completely different places. However, in fact, our feelings surpassed those of brothers and sisters. This seemed to be a very incredible thing.

Our living room was very narrow. In addition to two beds, there was hardly any room for activity. But we loved this place. In the morning, if we opened the dusty lattice window, soft sunlight would fill the floor. Outside the house, there was a small courtyard paved with stone slabs. A row of camellias was planted against the wall. A gust of wind would sweep in a warm fragrance. We felt a strong love for this small world.

Our life in the mountain city was very poor. Our wallets were often empty. But this did not shake our confidence in life. When we got some money from somewhere, we knew how to spend it: we went to the small shop to drink two cups of liquor, or we cleaned the house and inserted a bunch of purple bauhinia in the bottle. Once, we were almost penniless. That day seemed to be a festival. We were unwilling to stay in the house, but we couldn't afford to go out. Then, we didn't know where we picked up a lot of copper coins. It turned out that we usually didn't pay attention and threw them casually in the corner of the drawer. We collected a lot. Our excitement was almost indescribable. We felt that we were very rich at the moment. We ran and jumped to the stall and each ate two large bowls of rice noodles and ear blocks. With the remaining money, we also bought a large bag of peanuts. I spent that festival very happily.

Sometimes we also took walks on the highway in the suburbs. We often couldn't suppress the revealing of envious eyes to those men and women who were holding hands intimately. We secretly cursed in our hearts. We even said:

"Look how happy you are! The Old Man of Heaven will bring bad luck to you!"

We also liked to take village trips that were amusing to people. That was a trace of adjustment in our bitter and lonely lives. It made us lively and young.

But soon I left there because of something. My life began to be monotonous, like filling in a large blank.

Lei had written to me. He wrote:

"Today, the landlady came over and asked me. She said, "Mr. University, why hasn't Mr. Guo come?" What do you think I should answer her? I smiled bitterly at her for a long time."

After receiving the letter, I sat there bitterly for a long time. I was trapped in extreme annoyance.

Now it has been five or six years since then. Lei has probably returned to the north. Does he still miss our small room with the lattice window, and the camellias planted on the courtyard wall?

### Morning in Beiping

â€” Ling Xing

I miss Beiping.

In Beiping City in the mid-autumn weather, the morning is still shrouded in a quiet solemnity. There are a few rickshaw pullers who have been pulling night shifts. They are already tired and lazily pull the rickshaws back to the factory. When they meet friends who are leaving early, who are full of energy and walk from the opposite side, they greet them wearily:

"Good morning, Da Liu!"

Then, there is still a quiet solemnity left on the street. On Chang'an Street, this flat and open avenue, there are only a few people walking past. Going down from Nanchizi, you can see that Tiananmen is still a vague, hazy big block. The pair of Huabiao pillars standing outside the gate are like two pillars propping up the sky, high, high, disappearing into the lead-colored sky.

This place is too empty. In front of it is a large forest park of velvet flowers. Walking down the Han white jade avenue covered with the base of the bronze statue of the Premier, there are three or five customers carrying packages and riding horses, rushing forward. No one speaks, just like pilgrims worshiping saints, silent in front of the towering arrow tower. Occasionally someone coughs, and it echoes clearly far away, as if under the solemn and solemn altar, a cup on the altar is broken, even shocking oneself.

On both sides of Tiananmen, the gates of Zhongshan Park and the Temple of the Emperors are still closed. Gradually, some rickshaws pulling customers have run over. The rickshaw pullers step on the ground with their thousand-layered-sole shoes, making a "sha sha sha" sound. The people sitting in the car are all hugging their luggage wrapped in wool felt and wicker bags that have been flattened in several places. These people are not too stingy with the quiet solemnity, shouting loudly with their throats, flashing some innocent and unrestrainedness in their laughter, letting other men on the road stretch their necks to look, and then turn their heads and mutter in a low voice:

"Heh, students, rushing to Tianjin to study?"

Counting on their fingers, the August Festival is not far away, and it is time for school to start. These young people, living in the ancient city of Beiping, admire the lively schools in Nankai, Tianjin. They have endured two long months of summer at home. It is finally almost time for school to start, so they rush back early. No one in the family can stop them. They are willing to get up early before dawn and catch the 8 o'clock special express train. When they arrive in Tianjin, they can still catch a lunch at the beef restaurant they have been longing for.

Every time during the start of school season, travelers always envy these innocent and unrestrained students, because they arrive at the station earlier than anyone else, get better seats than anyone else, have fewer worries than anyone else, and are happier than anyone else. Sitting in the carriage, they are still talking loudly and laughing wildly.

These rickshaws turn from the vermilion red Sanzuomen, cross the rickshaws at the entrance of Zhongshan Park, and then ring loudly on the Han white jade driveway opposite Tiananmen, dragging down. The quiet solemnity of the ancient city of Beiping seems to be shattered by this. Walking past the velvet flower trees along the Han white jade driveway, the outside of Zhonghua Gate has been transformed. Stalls selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, fried liver and pig intestines, and old tofu... all kinds of breakfast stalls are set up, shouting loudly regardless of the cost. The apprentice of the mutton restaurant near the Xijiaomin Lane archway also calls out with a long voice:

"Eat buns! Hot buns! Hot buns, so hot!"

Morning in Beiping!

### Cold Night

â€” Bi Xichang

A night of wind and rain shattered the heart of the traveler; and disturbed the intestines of the conscript.

"My love is not for my homeland, but I grieve for my aging parents."

For the sake of survival, I have been struggling on the hunger line for three full years.

My chest is covered with sour andè¾› memories; deep in my heart is imprinted with indelible scars.

In the desolate and lonely inn, only the cold lamp is alone with me.

It is close to people, and it still has the look of accompanying me when I was studying, but it feels more cordial and flavorful.

The arrow of time is relentlessly pressing on the limited life.

The cold drips of the water clock waste away the good night; the sound of the drumming in the twelfth lunar month ends the remaining year.

But, it also brings dawn and the new spring.

How can I continue to wander in the vast future?

Clean up the wounds given by the times; seize the warmth given by the new spring. To create my new life.

### The Old Man Selling Groceries

â€” Ren Jun

â€”â€”One of the Street Ditties

Dong, dong, dong...

A white-haired old man selling groceries

ran overâ€”â€”

Shaking a long-handled small drum in his hand.

Carrying a huge cargo box on his back;

(Three or four times bigger than his body!)

Like a little ant

Carrying a golden fly,

Or a small piece of meat...

Dong, dong, dong...
