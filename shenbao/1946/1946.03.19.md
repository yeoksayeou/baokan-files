### Reasonable Regulations for Borderland Autonomy: The Mongolian-Tibetan Committee Reorganized as the Ministry of Border Affairs; Recruiting Talents from Three Ethnic Groups to Participate in the Government; Allocating Special Funds to Develop Various Undertakings

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] The Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee, at its 19th meeting on the morning of the 17th, passed a supplementary motion on borderland issues. The original text is as follows: It is found that our Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members constituting our great Chinese nation, and the regions where they are distributed are an inseparable part of our territory. Our party has always aimed to support and develop our borderland compatriots, hand in hand, and strive for their common prosperity, strength, and happiness. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, care and comfort have been somewhat lacking, leading to the fact that the wishes of our borderland compatriots may not have been fully realized. Looking back on the past, we cannot help but feel deeply concerned. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the responsibility of nation-building should be jointly borne by all our compatriots. In accordance with this spirit, this conference has carefully reviewed the relevant cases and decided on the following points based on the spirit of the cases and the main points of the reports and reviews, with the hope of their rapid implementation, so as to achieve the unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups in the country and lay the foundation for the long-term stability and security of the country. (1) Under the principles of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution, in order to form a unified and democratic country, the Constitution should have clear provisions guaranteeing the autonomous rights of borderland ethnic groups. (2) The members of the reorganized National Government Committee and the political affairs committee of the Executive Yuan must include loyal and capable comrades from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups. (3) Talented people from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups must have ample opportunities to participate in the actual work of various Yuan, Ministries, and Committees. (4) In the newly added quota of representatives to the National Assembly, the quota of representatives from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups should be appropriately increased, to be selected by the Central Government. (5) Reorganize the Mongolian-Tibetan Committee into the Ministry of Border Affairs, so that capable people from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups can participate in actual work and assume actual responsibilities. (6) In the education provided in schools at all levels in the borderland ethnic areas, attention should be paid to the languages of the respective ethnic groups, and the national language should be a compulsory subject. The Ministry of Education should consider implementing this. The principle for official documents of agencies at all levels should be to use both the national language and the language of the respective ethnic group. (7) The Central Government must formulate reasonable regulations regarding the autonomous systems in various borderland areas, according to the actual situation of each area: A. Regarding the Inner Mongolia part, restore the original Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee, and clearly delineate the powers and responsibilities between the League/Banner governments and the provincial/county governments. B. Regarding the Xinjiang part, it should be implemented in accordance with the methods determined in the resolution of the Xinjiang Provincial Incident. C. Regarding the Tibetan areas under provincial jurisdiction, they should be given real opportunities to participate in provincial and county politics. (8) Special funds should be allocated for various undertakings in the borderland areas, such as economy, transportation, education, health, and relief, and the relevant competent authorities should be responsible for formulating implementation plans and promoting them rapidly. (9) The National Defense Forces stationed in various borderland ethnic areas should be concentrated in several strategic locations, with food and provisions supplied by the Central Government, without interfering in local administration. All local security forces should be staffed by trained members of the local ethnic groups and people as a principle.

### President Chiang Encourages All Central Executive Committee Members to Assist the Government in Completing its Tasks

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] President Chiang attended the Central Memorial Week today, with all Central Executive Committee members in Chongqing participating. After President Chiang led the ceremony, he delivered an impromptu speech, first stating: "This Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee has been lengthy.

Now that the meeting has concluded, I hope that all of you will lead all Party comrades to assist the government in faithfully implementing these plans in order to complete the tasks of this plenary session."

### Night Navigation to be Restored Between Anqing and Jiangyin

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 17th] The Yangtze River Navigation Administration recently convened a meeting of relevant agencies to discuss improvements in navigation affairs. It was decided to first restore night navigation between Anqing and Jiangyin, and vessels are currently being allocated.

### Government to Reorganize in the Short Term; Mao Zedong to Attend National Government Committee; Communist Party Central Committee Preparing to Convene

[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] It is generally expected that the government will be reorganized in the short term. According to reliable sources, when the National Government Committee is reorganized, the CCP will obtain eight seats, headed by Mao Zedong. At that time, Mao will come to Chongqing to attend the committee. Zhou Enlai will enter the Executive Yuan, but it has not been decided which ministry he will head. It is rumored that the Executive Yuan will be greatly expanded, with the addition of eight ministries, including Labor, Railways, and Industry. Reports state that the Democratic League has designated Zhang Lan, Zhang Junmai, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, and Luo Longji as representatives to join the government during the reorganization. According to a dispatch from Peiping, the councilors of that city have decided to propose moving the capital to Peiping. This matter will be decided by the National Assembly. Several embassies have inquired with the National Government about this matter, but have not received a definite reply.

[United Press, Yan'an, 17th] General opinion here holds that President Chiang will continue to serve as President of China for some time to come. Contrary rumors are unlikely to materialize. Communist Party figures believe that President Chiang is in fact a necessary stabilizing force. Democratic League leader Liang Shuming stated that during the transitional period of the coalition government, President Chiang will remain at the center. This period should be at least ten months. President Chiang recently said in a speech that his work had been completed, which caused many misunderstandings.

[Another dispatch] The Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee has just concluded in Chongqing, and the Communist Party Central Committee also intends to convene a meeting. The date is expected to be after Zhou Enlai returns from Chongqing next week. The CCP Central Committee has a total of forty-four members, who are currently scattered throughout the country. Some of them are currently representatives of the military mediation executive group, some are engaged in the work of organizing a new constitutional government, and some are far away in the Northeast and cannot return in time. Therefore, it seems difficult for all members to attend the meeting. The central government has allocated two transport planes specifically for the CCP to pick up and transport representatives. After the Central Committee meeting, it will discuss various major developments in recent months and decide on some internal issues, such as whether to expand party membership and whether the CCP headquarters will move from Yan'an to Nanjing.

### Declaration of the Plenary Session (Continued)

Fourth, we demand the thorough implementation of the nationalization of the military to establish a foundation for peaceful unification. The nationalization of the military is a primary condition for political democratization. Only when the military is nationalized can orders from the central government be thoroughly implemented, the country can achieve unification in name and in reality, and democracy can be truly realized. Warlordism is anti-democratic, and no country should have such a phenomenon. If military and political orders cannot be unified, local order is disrupted everywhere, and the people's most anticipated peaceful and prosperous life is not guaranteed, how can construction be implemented? The government's orders to cease military conflicts and restore transportation, as well as the army organization and integration plan recently agreed upon by the military three-person group, must be uniformly observed and thoroughly implemented throughout the country. Only then will we not fail our country's painstaking efforts to seek peace and unity through tolerance, and only then can we give compatriots who have suffered so much an opportunity to recuperate and rebuild. This conference, in reviewing the current facts, cannot but resolutely demand that the CCP troops immediately cease their continued attacks and actions that hinder unification, so that the work of peaceful nation-building can proceed smoothly, and the implementation of democracy will not be merely empty words.

### Our Country to Organize and Train Aviation Boy Scout Troops

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Yuan Lize, Director of the Training Department of the Boy Scouts of China, recently came to Nanjing from Chongqing and then proceeded to Zhejiang and Anhui to oversee the demobilization of the Boy Scouts. According to him, China plans to organize and train aviation boy scout troops so that boy scouts who aspire to a career in aviation can receive basic aviation training.

### Greeting Endner in the Rain

— Our reporter, Katie

He, at the advanced age of seventy-one, with a lung cancer that all doctors have given up on; even so, he begged to come and see his beloved, victorious China, one last time.

Yesterday at twelve noon, an American Navy plane from Honolulu landed at the muddy Jiangwan Airport. This was no ordinary plane, the latest C54 model, with a bedroom, a bathroom, a bed, a nurse, a doctor... And it brought an extraordinary passenger – China's chief foreign advisor, Mr. Endner.

Accompanying him was former Deputy Minister of Propaganda, Dong Xian Guang. General Huang Renlin of the battlefield service corps, and Flying Tiger General Chennault were at the airport to greet him. When the reporter boarded this luxurious and comfortable plane, Mr. Endner was chatting with General Chennault. Overflowing with supreme friendship and warmth between China's earliest and latest foreign advisors, the reporter was deeply moved by this sincere and touching scene.

Mr. Endner was wearing a gray wool suit and a khaki raincoat. Because he came from Hawaii, he was also wearing a straw hat. This was a man who had once single-handedly reversed the course of Chinese history. However, he was tired. His complexion was very haggard, and after shaking hands with the reporter, he was not as eloquent and talkative as before. General Chennault and a doctor helped him off the plane. An American Navy cameraman took many photos of this VIP who had never liked to be photographed. General Huang Renlin had originally prepared an ambulance for him, but he finally sat in General Chennault's car, and with great difficulty, he picked out a small road that could barely be used for military maneuvers on the airport's endless mud, circled around to the airport gate, and then changed to General Huang's car, accompanied by Mr. Dong and Huang to rest in room 300 of the Hong En Hospital.

He has lung cancer! Admittedly, in America, he could certainly get better care, but this seventy-one-year-old elder, terminally ill, requested to see his beloved, victorious China before it was too late.

President Chiang and his wife especially asked Dong Xianguang to go to Honolulu to pick him up. The US Navy immediately agreed to send him a comfortable plane to ride on. General Huang Renlin was ordered by the President to take care of him in Shanghai, so he slept at the airport for two nights, waiting for the plane. The reporter also went to Jiangwan Airport for three consecutive nights to greet him. Because the reporter knew that although Mr. Endner had struggled to fly across half the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai, the evening sun was infinite, and the reporter did not know how many more times he would be able to see him! Perhaps, in his life, the reporter was the last journalist he saw. Mr. Endner is Australian, originally a journalist, who was assigned as the New York Herald Tribune's reporter in China. Later, he went to Hong Kong and served as the editor-in-chief of the "De Chen Western Newspaper."

During his time as a journalist, Endner's most historic masterpiece was exposing Japan's "Twenty-One Demands" to China. At this time, Endner was the editor of "Far East Review" in Shanghai. The full content of the "Twenty-One Demands" and Japan's ambitions were first exposed by "Far East Review," and the Japanese hated him to the bone.

In 1915 (the sixth year of the Republic of China), when Sun Yat-sen wanted to find an English assistant, he invited Endner to take charge of the matter. Since then, this Australian journalist has become a mysterious figure in modern Chinese history.

In 1927 (the sixteenth year of the Republic of China), Endner served as Zhang Zuolin's advisor, and then as Zhang Xueliang's advisor. Through Zhang Xueliang's introduction, he became an aide to President Chiang.

Over the years, he advocated the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and he also helped the campaign to overthrow Yuan Shikai. He also promoted Zhang Xueliang's allegiance to the central government, completing the unification of the North and South. But his most commendable achievement was his efforts during the Xi'an Incident. Everyone must be clear about this matter.

When the war began, Japanese soldiers sent him to a concentration camp in Manila. Imprisoned in his old age, he finally contracted the cancer that doctors around the world fear the most. After the victory, he recuperated on the island of Tahiti for a period of time, and then went to Honolulu, where he met Earle Salle, the editor of the former Shanghai English Greater American Evening News. However, Salle was already blind. Mr. Endner felt that it was time to write his memoirs, so he collaborated with Salle, asking him to sort out the materials and write them. Decades of behind-the-scenes work have made him one of the people who knows the most about China's secrets. His memoirs will undoubtedly be the most valuable historical materials since the Republic of China, because he himself created a part of history.

His eyes are still shining brightly, his language is still clear, his handshake is still full of warmth, and his appearance is not more old than when the reporter met him twelve years ago, but—he knew that he had contracted a "cancer" in his lungs that no doctor could cure!

Some people say that he doesn't eat Chinese food, that he doesn't pronounce President Chiang's name like a Chinese, that he doesn't understand Chinese temperaments, and that he uses a foreign perspective to handle Chinese affairs. However, this frail, terminally ill "foreigner" has never forgotten China and loves China so sincerely! May a miracle come to the medical community to help him recover soon!

### Ten Crimes of Traitor Chen Gongbo; Suzhou High Court Filed Public Prosecution Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] Han Tao, Chief Prosecutor of the Suzhou High Court, formally filed a public prosecution against traitor Chen Gongbo on the 18th and announced the following ten crimes of traitor Chen: (1) Concluding secret treaties that insulted the nation and infringed on its sovereignty; (2) Searching for materials and supplying them to the enemy; (3) Issuing counterfeit currency to disrupt the financial system; (4) Recognizing a thief as a father and declaring war; (5) Conscripting young men to serve the enemy; (6) Publicly selling opium to poison the people; (7) Revising teaching materials to implement slave education; (8) Taking advantage of the so-called "Qingxiang" campaign to massacre patriots; (9) Government officials engaging in corruption, with politics based on bribery; (10) Recruiting puppet troops to harm the country and the people.

[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] Reports state that the trial of traitors in Peiping has been going on for several days, but so far, most of those tried are insignificant puppet officials. Major traitors such as Wang Yitang are still being detained by the military authorities.

### Government Advisor Brandford Has Left the United States for China

[United Press, New York, 17th] The New York Times, citing sources close to the government, reported that Mr. Brandford, appointed by President Truman a few weeks ago to reorganize China's budget, will have responsibilities that are more extensive than originally specified in his appointment. It is said that Mr. Brandford flew from Washington to China on Sunday and will be responsible for "the actual reorganization of the Chinese government. At the same time, his decisions may affect the social life and economic future of the Chinese people." The newspaper said that it is expected that Mr. Brandford will instill American democratic ideas into China's political system, "adjusting it to suit China's ancient philosophies and methods as part of his work in building administrative and financial plans." Although Mr. Brandford's official qualification is as an advisor to the Chinese government, "his tasks will include many aspects of a national urban planner." Before leaving, Mr. Brandford acknowledged the above points when interviewed by a New York Times reporter, saying: "I admit that the matters I will assist China with will be broader than reorganizing China's budget. I will make full use of my experience in administration or government organization. As for what specific work I will undertake, it will be determined by the wishes of the Chinese government."

### National Army Advances Northward Beyond Shenyang; Personnel Receiving Heilongjiang and Hejiang Provinces Return to Changchun

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Chongqing News: The precarious Northeast situation has become more serious due to the chaotic state north of Shenyang, but diplomatic circles in both Beijing and Chongqing believe that the pressure from the Northeast Communist Army has other purposes. It is not speculation to ask whether the true intention behind this pressure is to create a special situation north of Shenyang before Marshall's return to China and wait for the Military Mediation Department to go there for mediation. Currently, peace-loving people in Beijing and Chongqing, both Chinese and foreign, hope that this peace envoy will return to China as soon as possible.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 17th] The receiving personnel from the Heilongjiang and Hejiang provincial governments returned to Changchun today by special train from Harbin. Harbin is currently surrounded by the Communist Army. There are occasional artillery exchanges in the suburbs, and robberies occur in the city from time to time.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] There was heavy snow here on the afternoon of the 17th, which stopped late at night. The snow was still heavy on the morning of the 18th. Long-distance telephone lines south of Changchun have been cut off since 4:00 PM on the 17th and have not yet been restored on the 18th. Wireless telegraph communications between here and Shenyang, Jinzhou, and other places have also been interrupted, due to power outages in the aforementioned areas. [Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 17th] Reliable sources report that after the Soviet troops withdrew from Kaiyuan, Tieling, and Changtu one after another, they were disturbed by nearby Communist troops. After the Soviet troops withdrew from Siping Street, it was surrounded by 20,000 Communist troops starting at 2:00 PM on the 16th, and the airport was occupied. Liu Handong, Chairman of Liaobei Province, is currently leading the security forces to defend the area. The situation is chaotic. It is also reported that the vanguard of the National Army is overcoming all obstacles and advancing northward along the Changchun Railway, beyond Shenyang.

[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] The Central Daily News reported today that fresh troops of the National Army are entering Shenyang in a steady stream.

### Communist Troops from Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hebei Provinces are Moving Northward in Succession; Part of Shandong Communist Troops Transfer to Northeast

[Report from our Nanjing office, 18th] Military news: Communist troops from Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei are currently frequently being transferred, with the Communist troops claiming to be preparing for reorganization.

Communist troops in Hebei are moving towards the vicinity of Baoding for reorganization. The northern part of Baoding has been blockaded by Communist troops.

[Report from our Nanjing office, 18th] Zhenjiang dispatch: Communist troops in Rugao, Dongtai, and Xinghua counties in northern Jiangsu have recently moved northward in part. Large quantities of rice and grain that the Communist troops requisitioned from farmers in the above three counties are being transported northward successively. The purpose is unclear, but it is definitely not a withdrawal.

[Report from our Jinan office, 17th] The Communist troops in the Tai'an group have stopped repairing roads, claiming a lack of fuel and materials. However, the group stated that 30 tons of coal had been transported there a few days ago, so the fuel should not be exhausted. The Communist troops also requested the Nationalists troops at Dakou to dismantle blockhouses. The issue of continuing road repairs is still pending negotiation by the CCP representative Zheng Rennong after he returns to Jinan from Yi.

### Wedemeyer Arrives in Peiping; Measures for Repatriating Japanese from the Northeast Said to Be Unresolved

[United Press, Peiping, 18th] General Wedemeyer arrived here at 2:00 PM today. During a reception for reporters, he stated: "By the end of this month, approximately one million Japanese soldiers and civilians in China will have been repatriated to their home country. I have also taken appropriate steps to plan for the repatriation of Japanese from the Northeast. If I am also responsible for this matter, it can be gradually implemented. However, the Northeast is currently occupied by Soviet troops, and the repatriation of Japanese from that area is still an unresolved issue and could easily cause misunderstandings. The United States feels that this is its responsibility because the Northeast has been recognized as part of the China war zone. Since we are all allies, any party can repatriate the Japanese."

### Iran Hesitates to File a Complaint; Soviets and Iranians are Negotiating Secretly; Rumors of a Possible Revolution in Tehran

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 18th Broadcasting: Iran, in these troubled times, has entered a state of quiet today. Iranian diplomatic actions are proceeding in secret. The Iranian Prime Minister refuses to meet with reporters. On the other hand, London officials have confirmed that if Iran does not file a complaint, the U.S. government will bring up the Iran issue before the Security Council.

[United Press International, London, 18th] Today, reliable sources here stated that Soviet experts are currently engaged in secret negotiations with the Iranian government regarding oil concessions. Reports indicate that revolutionary actions may occur in the Iranian capital. It is said that the Sandana government is taking emergency measures to prevent a revolutionary coup. Meanwhile, diplomatic circles here believe that while the Iranian Prime Minister appears to oppose Soviet demands on the surface, he is actually secretly negotiating an oil agreement with the Soviets. They claim that the Iranian government is studying the suggestion of the former British ambassador, Prendergast, to submit the issue of Iranian oil resources to the United Nations for discussion.

[United Press International, Washington, 17th] According to diplomatic circles here today, negotiations on the political situation in Iran are expected to reach a peak in the days leading up to the meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York. These individuals believe that the Soviet military's movements within Iran are solely intended to force Iran to grant Moscow the privilege of developing its rich oil resources, and are not intended to threaten Turkey.

[Reuters, London, 18th] A spokesperson for the Iranian Embassy in the UK announced today that Iran is only prepared to negotiate oil concessions with the Soviet Union on the condition that Soviet troops withdraw. Rumors that the Iranian Prime Minister is currently in Tehran negotiating with the Soviet side could not be confirmed or denied. However, Iranian law stipulates that oil concessions cannot be discussed until foreign troops have withdrawn, so the rumors are likely untrue.

[United Press International, Washington, 18th] The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Wan Romiko, returned to his post on Saturday after being away from the US for several months. It is expected that he will begin talks with senior US officials today in the hope of reducing the difficult issues facing the three powers when the United Nations Security Council convenes next Monday. Officials said that the key now lies with the Soviet side, and that if Moscow could issue some statement, it would be helpful to the overall situation.

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The Iranian Embassy in the United States has not yet received instructions from Tehran as to whether the Iranian government will file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council. According to authoritative sources, the Soviet Charge d'Affaires in Tehran threatened the Prime Minister, informing him that the Soviet Union would consider Iran's complaint an unfriendly act. The Iranian government's hesitation is due to this.

[United Press International, London, 17th] The United Press International's London bureau reported today that it listened to broadcasts from Radio Moscow stating that the Soviet Azerbaijan Republic, which borders Iranian Azerbaijan, has opened many new oil wells, and its oil production is increasing by 210 tons per day.

### Frequent Soviet Troop Movements; Transportation Between Iran and Turkey Severed

Tehran Radio Suddenly Stops Broadcasting

[United Press International, London, 17th] Tehran Radio suddenly stopped broadcasting this afternoon. As of now, there has been no explanation for this. [Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 17th] According to news from the Azerbaijan Province, Soviet troops have not moved south, and the troops stationed in various regions have increased. The greatest increase in troops has been west of Tabriz. Several roads from Tabriz to the Turkish border have been blockaded, and transportation has been severed. In addition, Soviet troops are still moving in northern Iran, but there are no signs of them crossing the boundary line and heading south into Iran.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Yesterday's Tehran news: After Soviet troops were reportedly reinforced in Karaj, Iran did not send any troops to that area. Iranian newspapers avoid commenting on the actions of Soviet troops within the country. Reports of Soviet troop movements are all headlined with "According to foreign radio stations." Iraqi political figures are closely watching the situation in Iran, and most newspapers are publishing the actions of Soviet troops in prominent positions. Some say that Soviet troops are currently only 70 miles from the Iraqi border.

### Soviet Troops in Tabriz Prevent American Vice-Consul from Passing

Released Only After Proving Identity

[United Press International, Washington, 17th] The State Department announced today that the American Vice-Consul in Tabriz, northern Iran, Luo Shaohua, was detained by Soviet sentries in that city for half an hour on Friday. He was released only after proving his identity.

The local Soviet Consul General expressed regret for the incident.

### US Ships Cruising in the Mediterranean; Plan Canceled

[Reuters, New York, 18th] New York Times military reporter, Baldwin, stated: According to inquiries, the plan for the US aircraft carriers Midway and Roosevelt, and other US ships, to cruise in the central and eastern Mediterranean has been canceled at the suggestion of the State Department. Officials feel that this cruising plan had unnecessary provocative overtones.

### Soviet Troops on Danish Island Rapidly Withdrawing

[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 18th] Soviet troops stationed on the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea are rapidly withdrawing. Troops and military equipment are being loaded onto Soviet ships in preparation for departure.

### US Government Wartime Authority Extended for Nine Months

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th, United Press] The US State Department has recently passed a measure to extend the government's wartime authority (including quantitative allocation and priority allocation rights) for nine months. This authority was originally scheduled to expire on June 30 of this year.

### Rampant Black Market in Germany; Thousands Arrested

[United Press International, Germany, 17th] Black market transactions in Germany are highly organized. Recently, an entire train car of coal was stolen and transported over two hundred miles away, where it was sold and used to buy potatoes. This case was revealed by a British military officer, who frankly admitted that without the black market, Germans would have nothing to live on. This refers to small-scale transactions, as Germans rely on them to maintain their personal needs. Small transactions can hardly be eradicated forever. We can only try to prevent black market transactions from becoming rampant and unmanageable. The authorities are dispatching special police to hunt down the big players in the black market. Although many have been arrested, other smugglers have mostly changed to using remote paths and small roads, making it difficult to catch them all in one sweep. Black market transactions in Brunswick have recently become increasingly prosperous. British troops once surrounded the entire area and searched house by house, and thousands were arrested.

### Soviet Delegation Arrives in Seoul

[Reuters, Seoul, 18th] A five-member Soviet delegation participating in the US-Soviet Korean Investigation Team, along with over a hundred technicians, arrived here today from the Soviet-occupied area of Korea. The investigation team will begin work tomorrow to study ways to coordinate the occupation of Korea.

Indian League Urges Earnestly

[Reuters, London, 18th] In light of the imminent arrival of the British Cabinet mission to India, the Indian League convened a conference today to show its goodwill. During the conference, Professor Hosain, chairman of the Indian Liberation Committee, gave a speech, saying that the freedom of every Indian man, woman, and child is not a gift granted by the British, but their natural right. Without a free India, there is no free world. If powerful nations do not clearly state their attitude towards other countries, the blood of ordinary people will be shed in vain. The British should have a long-term vision. If Indians cannot freely decide their destiny, there can be no world peace. If India becomes a center of turmoil in Asia, the world's economic recovery will be difficult to complete. Only after India obtains complete freedom can it maintain genuine friendship with the UK and cooperate in the world's recovery.

### Editorial: The Situation in the Northeast Requires Calm

Since the Soviet army withdrew from Shenyang, the situation in the Northeast has remained shrouded in gloom, and has not yet reached the anticipated clarity. Recent news from the Northeast has also been quite chaotic. According to a report from this newspaper's Peiping office on the 17th, the situation in the Northeast remains extremely confused. The Communist troops may enter Harbin and even Changchun under the guise of the Li Zhaolin case. General judgment states that after Marshall consults with Truman, major diplomatic actions between China and the United States will be decided and commenced. Xiong Shihui is currently in Jinzhou dealing with the complex and ever-changing situation. While there is news from Chongqing that the Military Three-Person Group has reached an agreement on the Northeast issue, the Mediation Headquarters here has not received any specific instructions. Generally speaking, if the Military Three-Person Group can reach an agreement on the broad issues of the Northeast, the severity of the Northeast problem can be reduced. According to another report from this newspaper's Peiping office on the 17th, Li Zhaolin's death has thrown a new bomb into the current situation in the Northeast. This new bomb will serve as the roar of an impending hurricane in the Northeast. Some say that a certain party wants to use this to dilute and offset the Zhang Xinfu case, but the Liberation Three-Day Gazette, published by the CCP, firmly claims that this is a conspiracy by Chinese reactionaries against the Soviet Union and the Communists. From these reports, it can be seen that the Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang is not enough to clarify the situation in the Northeast.

In Washington, after arriving in the US capital, Marshal Marshall said at a press conference: "The situation in the Northeast is extremely serious," "a matter of life and death," and "on my last night in China, until ten minutes before I left, we were still reaching an agreement on dispatching an executive team to the Northeast ... There is still no representative from the executive headquarters in the East Nine Provinces, and the situation there is changing rapidly. Troops are moving everywhere, and various small conflicts are inevitable. These troops, especially on the Communist side, are almost unaware that we have reached an agreement. Therefore, we must quickly send an executive team to the Northeast." In Marshal Marshall's frank remarks, he did not underestimate the seriousness of the situation in the Northeast, but gave the Northeast situation a balanced description. This is of great help in clarifying the situation in the Northeast.

However, the haze and chaos will eventually clear up one day. Given the seriousness of the situation in the Northeast today, we should especially know how to handle ourselves. The passion of national sentiment over the past month is not only sufficient to express the people's concern for the situation in the Northeast, but also a manifestation of the abundant and powerful vitality of our nation. However, the passion of national sentiment may not be of any positive help in resolving the situation quickly, and in some cases, it may even hinder the resolution of the situation. We cannot allow mistakes. The seriousness of the situation in the Northeast today is well known; the opening and even elimination of the serious situation requires our calm and composure. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly elaborated on the situation in the Northeast. The recent Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee also conducted a thorough review of the situation in the Northeast and proposed to establish a true friendship between China and the Soviet Union based on the principles of respecting our national sovereignty and maintaining world peace. It can be seen that our government, starting with Chairman Chiang, is exhausting its wisdom to seek a resolution to the situation in the Northeast. We should have faith in the government and should not add to the government's difficulties. Therefore, regarding the situation in the Northeast, we can no longer allow emotional excitement and should calmly and quietly await the government's measures and resolutions.

Moreover, our allies are also trying to find a way to resolve the Northeast issue. The notes sent by the UK and the US to the Soviet Union one after the other indicate how concerned the UK and the US are about resolving the situation in the Northeast. The reason why the Northeast issue has emerged in its current form is that international relations exist within it. Therefore, with the cooperation of our allies in resolving the Northeast issue, a satisfactory resolution can always be reached. At this time, we need to suppress our emotions to avoid adding to the seriousness of this already serious situation. In terms of the international relations of the Northeast issue, even figures like Marshal Marshall do not shy away from the seriousness of the situation. It can be seen that people in allied countries have a correct understanding of the situation in the Northeast; with a correct understanding, it is possible to have an appropriate resolution. The Northeast issue is an international problem. As long as international people have a correct understanding of this situation, it will not be difficult to have an appropriate resolution to this problem. This is another point why we need to be calm and composed.

In his closing remarks at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, Chairman Chiang said that we must use the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual concession to resolve the current disputes. After mentioning Marshal Marshall's contributions, the chairman also said: "Our allies are so concerned about the peace and unity of China, let alone our own compatriots. Of course, we should abandon any prejudices, take into account the future of the entire China, and implement the goal of peaceful unification. I hope that the Chinese Communist Party can sincerely accept the good intentions of our allied friends in the same way as our government. Faithfully implement the agreed plan, do not take actions outside the plan, and do not create unexpected complications. Then I believe that General Marshall's mission can be successful as scheduled." In today's serious situation in the Northeast, Chairman Chiang's closing remarks are particularly meaningful. We hope that the Communist troops in the Northeast and the Chinese Communist Party will deeply appreciate Chairman Chiang's remarks. Mutual understanding and mutual concession require tolerance. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, this is another point that requires us to be calm and composed.

### US Adopts the Latest P2V Aircraft

Long Range, High Speed, Strong Firepower, Used to Maintain Law and Order

[Reuters, Hollywood, 18th] The United States Navy Department announced: the adoption of the new P2V peace patrol aircraft to maintain law and order in important areas of the United States. The engineering design of these aircraft is the most up-to-date. The carrying capacity and range are comparable to the B17 Flying Fortress and B24 Liberator super aircraft. Army and Navy engineers designed for two and a half years before completing this patrol aircraft with the longest range, highest speed, and strongest firepower. For example, a P2V aircraft based in Guam can reach Wake Island, Tokyo, Manila, Rabaul, etc., for non-stop patrol flights. A base in Manila can fly around Singapore, Shanghai, Hanoi, and other places. These aircraft can make non-stop flights of more than 5,000 miles, so non-stop flights from New York to Hawaii, Tokyo to Seattle, and Washington to Insk, can be made without refueling. The maximum speed is more than 300 miles per hour, and the normal speed is also more than 300 miles per hour. The aircraft is equipped with complete radar equipment and atomic bomb launchers, and can instantly become an invincible bomber. The wingspan and fuselage length of the aircraft, and the total bomb load, are similar to those of the Flying Fortress. It is equipped with two giant Pratt & Whitney engines with a total of 4,600 horsepower. The range at full load is 3,500 miles, and the normal range is more than 5,000 miles, exceeding the range of the Flying Fortress by 50%, and can be compared with the B29 aircraft that ended Japan's fate. The P2V aircraft weighs 58,000 pounds, and its effectiveness is above that of a four-engine aircraft. After the engine form is improved, it is smaller than the engine of the B29 aircraft.

### Local News

Suzhou: The Military Ministry Suzhou Receiving Group Abolished. The Military Ministry Suzhou Receiving Group has completed the receiving matters and is now abolished. It is learned that the group has been ordered to be abolished. The received military supplies and materials have been registered, reported, and sealed into storage. The group's warehouses in Mudu, Hanshan Temple, Pingmen, Shanren Bridge, East Railway Station, Hengshan, Qingyangdi, West Kuatang and other eight locations have been handed over to the Military Ministry's Supervisory Corps to temporarily take custody.

Changshu: Relief Flour Arrives Continuously. The Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the Relief Administration has shipped the second batch of 800 bags of relief flour, totaling 15 tons. Together with the first batch of flour shipped to Yu, there are a total of 3,100 bags, which will be allocated to the seawall workers for disaster relief. The Industrial Association Requests Tax Rate Reduction. Xue Mingjian, Chairman of the South Jiangsu District Branch of the Chinese Industrial Association, stated that before the War of Resistance, the business tax on factories was levied according to the amount of capital. Now it has been changed to be levied according to the amount of turnover. Yesterday, he telegraphed the Legislative Yuan again, requesting that the tax law be revised and that the amount of capital be used as the standard in order to encourage production. He also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for relief from stamp duty and requested that the starting tax base be changed to over one thousand yuan and the tax rate be changed to one-thousandth.

Zhenjiang: Planning to Establish the Jiangnan Electrical Bureau. Before the War of Resistance, there were 116 electrical enterprises in Jiangsu Province, accounting for 23% of the country's power plants, with a total generating capacity of 340,000 kilowatts, accounting for 35% of the country's total generating capacity. After the victory, the central government believed that the electrical industry was of great importance to industrial development, so the Jiangnan Electrical Bureau was established, equipped with huge capacity, to coordinate and control, and implement a plan for centralized power generation and long-distance transmission. Now, the Suzhou-Ningbo Branch, in order to cooperate with the central government's plan, has decided to first plan to restore the original power plants in northern Jiangsu, and secondly, to use the surplus equipment from the original power plants in southern Jiangsu, and request the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to install and transplant them to northern Jiangsu, in order to achieve balanced development of the electrical industry in both the north and south of the Yangtze River. The branch also believes that with the future prosperity of cities, the recovery of industry, and the inevitable increase in population, the existing water volume in Nanjing and Zhenjiang will be insufficient. Also, factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, Xuzhou, Nantong and other places are gradually increasing, and the population will inevitably increase sharply. It is also necessary to add water plants to improve environmental sanitation. Therefore, the branch is now starting to plan and organize the water plants in Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and to study and work on the addition of water plants in Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, Xuzhou, and Nantong. Public School Staff Engage in a Disguised Work Slowdown. Due to the soaring prices of goods and the high cost of living, public school staff in Wuxing were forced to take a day off on the 11th to demand improved treatment. However, on that day, some people in charge of duty in the departments of various agencies, only the work was slightly stagnant. All schools had classes as usual. Also, public school staff in Changxing took a day off on the same day.

Huzhou: Two Wuhan Traitors Arrested One After Another. Shangguan Yulin, a graduate of the third class of Huangpu, joined the puppet army after the fall of Changxing, willingly colluding with the enemy and committing many evils. After the victory, he hid in Huzhou City. After being reported, he was arrested by the local procuratorate and investigated according to law.

### Discussion of Post-War Education Films in the United States: Speech by Wu Junsheng After Returning from Inspection

[Our newspaper, Nanjing] Wu Junsheng, former Director of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education, was ordered to go to the United States in February of last year to inspect education. He inspected education in major cities in the United States and Canada for a year. He returned to China this spring and has reported the results of his inspection to the Ministry of Education.

Recent Trends in American Education

According to his discussion: American post-war education has been fully restored. Because scientific research has made great contributions during the war, scientific research is still highly promoted after the war. For students who participated in service work during the war, the government provides preferential treatment to those who return to school to study at this time, by giving public funding. Currently, the United States is trending towards abandoning weaknesses and using strengths. Universities and middle schools focus on the simultaneous mastery of basic subjects and cultural cultivation, in order to cultivate versatile talents who, in addition to specialized skills, can also be proficient in various arts.

Statistics of Students at All Levels

It is also learned that in American higher education, out of a total population of 130 million, there are more than 1.3 million students receiving higher education, an average of one person per hundred receiving higher education. Schools are also increasing year by year as needed. As for secondary education, middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools are everywhere. All primary school graduates who reach the age of entering secondary school voluntarily enter middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. Secondary education in the United States has almost become universal compulsory education, which is extremely popular. As for primary education, most children of school age have received national education. The ratio of actual school-age children to children in school is more than 95%, which is extremely popular.

### A Student Uprising Occurs at Jinan University

The Words "Cangfu" Cause a Misunderstanding

[Dahua News Agency, Jianyang] At National Jinan University, Professor Wei Yinglin of the College of Liberal Arts, when explaining the word "Cangfu" in "A New Account of Tales of the World," said that "stealing father" was the way southerners used to refer to northerners in the past, similar to what Shanghainese call Jiangbeilao. Unexpectedly, this caused a misunderstanding among two students from northern Jiangsu, who immediately questioned him.

Riot: After Wei's explanation, it had already subsided, but after class, some students in the school, instigated by professors and students who disagreed with Wei, launched an organization called the "School Protection Committee," and slogans such as "Down with Wei Yinglin" suddenly appeared everywhere in the school. By the next night, these students rushed to Wei's residence and destroyed it. Another group of students in the school opposed this behavior and launched a "School Protection Group" to confront them. At the same time, it was discovered that the instigator of the destruction of Wei's house was another professor, Lu Huaidao, and the crowd was outraged, so they also rushed to Lu's residence and destroyed it. At this point, the two groups of students were in a stalemate, and the entire school went on strike.

Mediation: At the same time, both sides prepared weapons, almost leading to violence. Fortunately, with the strong mediation of local party, government, and military circles, a tragedy was avoided. All the teachers in the school also issued a "Letter to All Students," suggesting that since both groups of students were premised on "protecting the school," "loving the school" should take maintaining the school's reputation and resuming classes as the top priority, and all difficult issues should be resolved after President He returned to school. Subsequently, both groups of students agreed to resume classes immediately, but the classes of Professors Wei Yinglin and Lu Huaidao were ended ahead of schedule, and they left the school first. Whether Wei and Lu will continue to teach in the next semester will be decided after President He returns to school. A disturbance was thus resolved.

The results of the review will be completed and announced by the end of April 1947. (4) Private vocational schools and above that have not been registered with the puppet organization, after completing the registration with the Ministry in accordance with legal procedures and being approved, their graduates' grades in school, after being reviewed and qualified by the Ministry, their graduation qualifications will be recognized without screening.

### Trial Begins for the Case of the Murder of Pilots Shot Down During the Bombing of Tokyo

Captain Nelson Testifies in Court Detailing the Process. The Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal Attends the Hearing. [Our newspaper] The trial of the case of the murder of the Doolittle pilots who bombed Tokyo began yesterday morning in Tilanqiao Prison by the US military court. The defendants are former Commander of the 13th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai, Sawada Shigeru, former warden of the Japanese military prison in Shanghai, Tachide Sotetsuro, former judge of the Japanese military court in Shanghai, Wakomitsu Yujitsuru, and Okada Ryuhei. After the court opened, the prosecutor reported on the case and applied for the prosecution of the four defendants, and read out the US government's note to the Japanese government through the Swiss government after the Sino-US declaration of war, urging it to abide by international wartime law, and

Protect prisoners of war, and received a reply from the Japanese government. Then, witness Captain Nelson reported the process. Nelson and other 119 pilots were ordered on April 18, 1942, to bomb Tokyo and other major cities, but the bombing targets were absolutely military installations. He also presented a map issued to each person by the authorities. On the way back, he and Lieutenant Fa's two planes were forced to land near Ningbo due to lack of gasoline. Of the ten people in the two planes, two died and eight were searched and captured by the Japanese military police three days later and sent to Shanghai. Later, they were sent to Tokyo. More than ten days later, they were interrogated by the Japanese Air Force, and then transferred to the Qiaotou Building in Shanghai. After two months, they were sent to the Jiangwan Concentration Camp, where they were treated harshly. Later, the former Japanese military court in Shanghai opened the trial, neither according to the trial regulations nor with a translator. During the interrogation, they were also severely beaten. The eight people were sentenced to death. Later, they were pardoned by the Japanese Emperor. Nelson and five others were sentenced to life imprisonment, and the other three were executed immediately. The trial adjourned at 4:30 pm yesterday and is scheduled to continue this morning. Also, when the case opened yesterday, the Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal also attended the hearing.

### Three Cases of Being Accused of Colluding with the Enemy Awaiting Judgment: Puppet Legislative Committee Member Convicted

Gan Deyun Sentenced to Seven Years of Imprisonment

[Our newspaper] The Criminal Division of the Tilanqiao High Court opened a joint court at 2 pm yesterday to hear four cases of traitors. Except for the Hui Wenyuan case, which was adjourned because all three defense lawyers failed to appear in court, the other three cases were closed for debate and will be sentenced at 2 pm on the 25th of this month. Here are the brief records of the three cases that have been closed for debate: (1) Lu Jinbiao, 31 years old, from Xinghua, was accused of serving as a guard of the 76th Regiment of the 22nd Puppet Division in Xinghua in January 1945. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him for colluding with the enemy to plot against the country and serving in relevant military positions. The defendant argued that he was a peddler and had never been to Xinghua. His lawyer, Wu Chuliang, argued that the evidence against him had not been investigated, and that there were many who served in the puppet army, so why was he the only one accused of being a traitor, which clearly indicated that there were other reasons for this, and requested that he be declared innocent.

(2) 43 years old, from Ningbo, was accused of being a special agent and intelligence officer for the 1629th Unit in 1937, a tea house worker in the Huazhong Railway Protection Zone in Hangzhou in 1939, and a translator at the Longhua Aircraft Factory in 1943. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him for colluding with the enemy and recruiting workers for the enemy. Lin Zhi admitted that he was a tea house worker in the Huazhong Railway Protection Zone, arguing that it was due to financial hardship. His lawyer, Wu Zhaochang, also used this to defend him and cited that he was falsely accused by the landlord due to a housing dispute.

(3) Le Jiajun, from Zhenhai, 26 years old, was accused of serving as an investigator in the Fifth Section of the Puppet Economic Bureau. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him because the Fifth Section of the Puppet Economic Bureau was in charge of the rise and fall of prices and had engaged in extortion of merchants. Witness Wang Shuang, the accountant of Yichang Silk and Satin Shop on Shandong Road, testified in court that Le had come to the shop to investigate in September 1944, and that the shop had sent him a festival gift of 40,000 yuan, which was recorded in the accounts. Another witness, Yao Ruilian, pointed out that he had threatened him in the name of investigation. The defendant argued that he was an internal staff member in the Economic Bureau and had never gone out to investigate. His lawyer, Wu Chuliang, argued that he had left the bureau in April 1944 and requested further investigation.

[Also News] The traitor Gan Deyun (Kentwell, i.e., Gan Weilu) was accused of being a member of the Puppet Legislative Yuan and founded the magazine "Voice of China." The case had been previously reported in detail in this newspaper and had been closed for debate. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui announced the verdict: "Gan Deyun is guilty of colluding with the enemy and plotting against the country, and is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for five years, and all property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of his family, shall be confiscated." Gan looked quite indignant after hearing the verdict.

### Japanese Factory Director Who Killed Our Compatriots Not Apprehended

[Our newspaper] The Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court opened a trial on a case of a Japanese person killing our compatriots yesterday afternoon. The case originated with Ye Jigu, a 34-year-old Nanjing native, residing at No. 5 Xilin Family Residence, Xinzhao Zhou Road, who worked at the Jiangnan Shipyard. On September 15, 1939, Ye and workers from his department were sent by the factory to repair the Minsheng warship. On that day, the work was completed, and the ship sank that night. After a thorough investigation by the factory, it was alleged that only Ye and five others knew about the secret hatch at the bottom of the ship, so they falsely accused Ye, Lu Ada, and Zhang Yongfang of being "Chongqing elements" who deliberately sabotaged their military construction. Factory Director Nakayama Hajime (residing at No. 13 Park Lane, Jiangwan Road) sent Police Section Chief Yoshimura (residing at No. 14 in the same lane) to arrest them and subject them to torture to extract confessions. The next day, they were transferred to another location, and have not been heard from since. After the victory, Ye Jiaxi and Lu A'er sued the local procuratorate, which summoned Yoshimura, who admitted to the incident, saying that he was acting on orders and did not know that Ye and others had died. However, since Ye and others were falsely accused of "sabotaging military construction," they were undoubtedly executed. After a detailed investigation by the local procuratorate, they were prosecuted for the crime under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, because Nakayama Hajime had not been apprehended and Yoshimura did not appear in court, the trial was adjourned for further hearing.

### Bystander Helps Capture Thief - Police Bureau Rewards 10,000 Yuan

At that time, Zhao Zenggui, a plainclothes police chief from the sub-bureau, happened to be passing by and helped Deng seize a Mauser gun with eleven bullets. At the same time, the two police officers who had been chasing after him also arrived and saw that the robber's head had been hit by two bullets, and he died soon after.

### Gold Shops Have Brisk Business as Redemption Enquiries Surge - Gold Prices Rise Slightly - Central Bank Continues to Allocate

Yesterday, the report that US Senator Wang Zhang raised the gold purchase price caused a general floating belief in gold purchases among the people. Small gold shops saw a surge in redemption inquiries. The market opened with replenishment yesterday (in fact, the price of gold in this city has risen to over 80 yuan per tael). Those who knew the situation in the industry sold off, and soon retreated to around 1.65 million, before starting to struggle. After 10 o'clock, it hovered below 1.64 million. The Central Bank allocated 390 bars to the industry at a price of 1.62 million, and this price was also seen at the lowest. The market was very stable at noon, standing at around 1.64 million. There were still sporadic retail sales in the afternoon, and although trading was limited, the market price rose slightly to around 1.66 million. As a result, it was about 60,000 better than last Saturday. Gold shop ornaments were quoted at 180,000 yuan, silver bullion at 1,600, and silver dollars were sold at 870 yuan. The money market was average, and the underground interest rate ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 cents. The position of speculators was tighter than that of outsiders.

Foreign currency US dollars were mediocre, opening at around 2,050 yuan. The gold market fell back, and then slightly dropped to around 2,030 yuan. It remained stable and quiet at noon and in the afternoon. As a result, it was 15 yuan better than last Saturday. Hong Kong tickets were once popular, and finally old goods were stable and new goods turned weak (new Hong Kong goods retreated to 29% compared to old goods). Old goods once rose to 440 yuan for purchase, and new goods never exceeded the high price of Saturday. As a result, old goods rose another 5 yuan, and new goods fell back 3 yuan. The US exchange rate remained unchanged, Hong Kong telecommunications was 450 yuan, and Robbie was 550 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks End Long Positions - Foreign Stocks Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Become Active

Although public bonds rose yesterday, it was difficult to sustain. Class C once rebounded to around 1,850 yuan, but the stock market fell and the bondholders also felt weak, and then fell by more than 200 yuan. The results of the noon close were that Class A, B, D, and E closed slightly earlier and rose slightly compared with last Saturday, while Class C fell slightly. After the Chinese stocks were sold off by long positions last Saturday, they moved to foreign stocks. Yesterday, there was a sudden and universal end to long positions. The initial opening of each stock was still stable. The industry's long positions were the first to end, and the customer's floating long positions followed suit. Yongsha retreated to 3,600 yuan, and Mayia to 2,650 yuan, and then there was a slight rebound. The smaller familiar stocks fell by 10% from the opening price and ended at a low price.

A large amount of floating capital gathered when they saw the heat. Yisha jumped to the 7,000 yuan mark in the morning, and the British Federation to the 9,000 yuan mark. The market price was manipulated under the hype. Some foreign merchants with sharp eyes and quick hands also chased after them, and at noon, some saw the high and turned around, and some were still surrounded by buying. Compared with last Saturday, Yisha Yinglian jumped by 20% in the hottest attitude, and the rest ranged from 10% to 15%.

### Commercial Banks in Recovered Areas - Supplementary Measures Already in Place

The Ministry of Finance has formulated a "Commercial Bank Restoration Method in Recovered Areas" and a "Commercial and Financial Institution Liquidation Method in Recovered Areas," stipulating that commercial banks approved by the Ministry of Finance before the war may be liquidated and restored. Others that have not been approved by the Ministry of Finance will be liquidated in accordance with the "Liquidation Method" and will not be allowed to operate. Later, in order to avoid the impact on local finance caused by the stagnation of a part of the Shangrong firms and banks in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and other places with a long history but not registered before the war due to the restrictions of laws and regulations, based on the facts, the "Supplementary Measures for the Restoration of Commercial Banks" was formulated. The main contents are as follows: (1) All firms and banks that have not been approved for registration by the Ministry of Finance and were established before the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and continued to operate during the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to being liquidated in accordance with the "Commercial and Financial Institution Liquidation Method in Recovered Areas," may submit the following documents within three months after the promulgation of these measures, and after being approved by the Ministry of Finance, may continue to operate in the original place and register in accordance with regulations. Otherwise, they will be ordered to suspend operations. The documents required are (1) the business license issued by the former Ministry of Industry or the Provincial and Municipal Government Engineering Bureau, (2) proof of joining the local chamber of commerce or commercial association before the war, (3) proof of no collaboration during the Anti-Japanese War, (4) the income statement for the year before the war to two years and for each year during the Anti-Japanese War, (5) the tax payment certificate before the war, (6) the document from the local municipal and county government proving its relationship with local finance, (7) All firms and banks that have not been approved for registration by the Ministry of Finance and were established before June 26th of the Republic of China (1937), and were suspended due to the Anti-Japanese War, are required to submit the previous items (1), (2), (5), (6), (7) within three months after the promulgation of these measures The documents and proof of suspension due to the Anti-Japanese War, the income statement for one to three years before the Anti-Japanese War, and after being approved by the Ministry of Finance, may resume operations in the original place, and then complete the registration procedures.

### US Gold Price Problem - Miners Demand Higher Prices - Congress Unlikely to Approve

[Reuters, Denver, Colorado, 18th] The United States is gradually resuming gold mining. Last year's output was the smallest since 1847, with 967,000 ounces of pure gold. This compares with 995,000 ounces in 1944 and 6,003,000 ounces in 1940, the highest record ever (including the Philippines). In terms of value, it was US$34 million in 1945 and US$210 million in 1940. The main US gold mines were all closed from October 1942 to July 1, 1945. Since the cancellation of the closure order in July last year, gold production has gradually increased, but four-fifths of the gold produced in the United States is a by-product of ordinary metal mines. These ordinary metal mines are hindered by lack of materials and labor. Moreover, the price of gold is fixed, while general prices are gradually rising, and production costs are increasing, which makes miners hesitant. Producers and members of Congress in gold-producing states, in addition to finding ways to compensate for the losses during the wartime shutdown period, are urging the authorities to pass legislation stipulating the following items: (1) Provide special interest-free government loans (secured by future production, not by the mines themselves); (2) Raise the price of gold to US$56 per ounce; (3) Give US gold mine operators a subsidy of US$10 per ounce; or (4) Allow gold mine operators to sell gold at the most favorable prices to the world, that is, to freely buy and sell on the world market. However, the hope of passing the above points in Congress is extremely slim.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise

The rice market is still rainy, and japonica and indica rice continue to rise by 500-600 yuan, up to nearly 1,000 yuan. Although the external sales of flour are sluggish, the local demand is strong, and the price continues to rise. The oil market raw oil sells as soon as it arrives, and soybean oil cannot match the sales as it arrives. The demand exceeds the supply, and the price continues to rise by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybeans are in high demand and secondary stock is stagnant, soybean cakes rise by more than 100 yuan, and skin rises by more than 100 yuan, raw kernels are firm, and sesame is average.

It is also reported that from March 11 to 16, a total of more than 42,000 dan of rice of various colors arrived at the temporary rice market in this city, including 21,891 shi of white japonica, 16,496 shi of thin rice, 900 shi of sheep indica, 3,048 shi of Du oil, 140 shi of Wu indica, 80 shi of white yuan, and 100 shi of Yin yuan.

### HSBC Banknotes - Some Have Been Altered in Hong Kong

Hong Kong News: HSBC's large-denomination banknotes of 50 yuan, 100 yuan, and 500 yuan, because some of them belonged to banknotes that were forced to be reissued during the fall, Hong Kong announced after its restoration that this kind of large-denomination notes issued under duress, with designated numbers, were temporarily suspended from use. Since then, although these banknotes have not circulated on the market, black market exchanges have often hovered at about half of the face value, either higher or lower. However, it has recently been discovered on the market that the numbers of these temporarily non-circulating banknotes have been altered to general numbers. Because the alteration work is very sophisticated, the public did not pay attention to it at first, and it was not able to be revealed. Later, it flowed into the bank, and was discovered by people in the bank. It was not until the Hong Kong authorities officially re-issued the 100 yuan banknotes with numbers starting from 65,000 that more banknotes with altered numbers that had not been announced as approved for circulation were discovered. According to a reporter from the bank, it is difficult to discover this kind of banknotes with altered numbers, and only people in the bank that issued this kind of banknotes have a few points that can be used as a basis for identification.

### Yarn Market Flat - Progress in Spot Cotton Trading

The yarn market yesterday was still very mediocre, with few customers and a very indifferent sentiment, so the fluctuations were very narrow. As a result, the market was neither glorious nor disgraceful compared with the end of the weekend. The Fangjian Company routinely posted prices at noon, offering for sale more than 20 kinds of yarn from 1 count to 60 counts. The 20-count yarn, which has not been sold for a long time, was auctioned yesterday, with a price of 1 million yuan per bale, which is lower than the transaction price on the market, but it will take at least five days to deliver the spot goods.

Yesterday, New York US cotton rose and fell differently, up and down 2 to 9 points. The near-term was US$26.62, the far-term was 26.39, and the meterling spot was 27.22. The local spot cotton market was firm, and trading also progressed, because private yarn factories such as Shenxin 169 should purchase successively. A total of 1,200 to 1,300 bales were traded, but Fangjian Company is still waiting and seeing.

### Application Deadline for Foreign Exchange Operating Firms Extended

(Central News Agency, This City News) According to Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Review Department of the Central Bank, the deadline for various firms to apply to the bank to be approved as Class A and B operating firms and foreign exchange brokers, originally set for March 19 this year, has been extended for two weeks with the approval of the Ministry, and the deadline has been changed to April 2 this year. After review, foreign exchange operating licenses will be issued. Since the Central Bank opened foreign exchange, in addition to the 27 designated Chinese and foreign banks and 16 qualified foreign exchange brokers (Chinese and foreign), and qualified China Travel Service of Class B, there have been increasing numbers of applications for approval as Class A and B operating firms and brokers. As of yesterday, there were a total of 144 companies in Class A (including one foreign merchant and one out-of-town merchant), five companies in Class B (including three Chinese and two Western), and 24 applications for brokers (Westerners accounted for four). It is heard that the qualifications for Class B operating firms must be those without branches all over the world, and it is expected that there will be three. Due to concerns about affecting the business within their scope, it will be difficult to add more brokers for the time being, except for those who have already qualified.

### 90,000 Bales of American Rice - Will Arrive Soon

(Special Report from Our Newspaper) Food panic is spreading globally. China relies on imported rice for subsidies. Before the war, imported rice was shipped from Siam, Vietnam, Burma, etc. However, during the war, there were poor harvests everywhere, so exports were prohibited. The source of imported rice is lacking. The United States, in view of this, is trying to provide relief. It is now learned that 90,000 bales of rice have been purchased from Houston and are being loaded onto the Deek Lykes to be shipped to China for relief. They will arrive soon. Yesterday, bituminous coal was allocated at par by various production factories.

### Factory Coal Allocation - Bituminous Coal Plummets Yesterday

Yesterday, bituminous coal began to be allocated at par to various production factories, so factory sales stagnated, and households were full of coal. The market was quiet, and prices continued to fall. White coal crumbs also continued to fall due to the steady flow of goods, but white coal screened lumps were still exhausted, and prices were stable.

The application method for the Fuel Management Committee's factory flat coal is that the industry association must compile and apply for review, and each factory can directly obtain the form from the association, fill it out and apply. The deadline for requesting the form is three days.

### High Hat

— Xiaoshan

There is an English saying: "You can tell a gentleman by his top hat."

Perhaps because humans are beings who cannot do without hats; therefore, when monkeys dress up as humans, they must also wear a hat on their heads to look the part.

Since hats have a hierarchical nature, distinguishing between a "person" and a "non-person," they naturally also distinguish between "people" and "superiors." Thus, figures wearing tall top hats are elevated to the status of "gentlemen." At the very least, you can stand before the "Gentleman" sign hanging in front of the toilet without feeling ashamed.

A top hat may be an abstract thing, but when it lands on one's head, it feels very concrete. Therefore, no matter how high and large the hat is, there is always someone to wear it; even if some people's heads are not particularly strong, strangely, no matter how high the hat is worn like a tower, not only is there no burden, but they feel a burst of lightness, comfort, and even a sense of elation! There are days when they almost cannot get through the day without wearing a top hat.

"Psychology is the soul of the market." Where there is demand, there is supply. Therefore, top hats quickly became one of the "hot commodities" of worldly philosophy. At any time, in any place, for any person, offering them a top hat is always supremely auspicious. They may have a good impression of you; you may have new gains from them!

Clever people, when they put this mysterious hat on someone else's head, may be secretly thinking: "What, there are actually people who like this illusory thing?" But when another person puts a top hat on their head, they obediently feel "comfortable"!

People cannot escape contradictions. The more contradictory things are, the more they enjoy spinning around in them. This is what allows top hats to flourish in the circle of contradictions, to be born and grow.

A gentleman hailed a rickshaw and was about to negotiate the fare when the rickshaw puller offered him a top hat: "What's there to negotiate! Would a gentleman like you haggle over such a small amount?" After pulling half the distance, the gentleman returned the favor with a top hat: "Look at the way you're pulling, you're running with incredible energy!" As a result, the gentleman rode a rickshaw that was as fast as a car, and the rickshaw puller received a fare equal to that of a car, to everyone's delight!

Mutual flattery, mutual benefit! The contradiction lies here, and the wonderful use also lies here!

If people are still so proud, they will become more ignorant, and their ignorance will often be mistaken for more wisdom!

It seems that the future of top hats is still quite bright.

### Spring in Yangzhou

— Lu Wu

It has been almost half a year since the victory. The Japanese North Jiangsu garrison in Yangzhou has been disarmed and sent to the concentration camp in Xin Nanmen. Sun Liangcheng's troops, who imposed excessive taxes and harassed the people, have been transferred to Anhui. The people's frenzy of welcoming the National Army has gradually cooled down. The red and green slogans and large murals on the streets and alleys have also been eroded by the ruthless wind and rain, leaving only fragments of remnants. With the arrival of spring, what it brings to the common people of the county is displacement, excessive taxes, the supply of permanent troops, the requisitioning by the county government, soaring prices, this series of threats to the people's suffering... Poor North Jiangsu!

Although the destruction of Yangzhou is not comparable to that of northern Fujian, Guilin, and Liuzhou, if you wander through the former residences of salt merchants, you will only see broken tiles and dilapidated walls. The towering mansions of the past have vanished without a trace. The flowers, plants, and trees in the scenic area north of the city have been completely cut down, and the so-called Slender West Lake is just a pool of Wu water. "Green Willow City Walls" has become a historical term, left for those who study history to reminisce! The city is surrounded by deep ditches and ramparts, and the city guards with guns and live ammunition are once again in a state of high alert as if facing a formidable enemy. The residents of the county town spent the harsh winter in this apprehensive and tense situation. Now it is spring, let the sunshine shine on and warm everyone!

Among the dozen or so counties in North Jiangsu, there is not a single place that has not been trampled by the enemy's iron hooves. Countless people have died in the artillery fire, especially in the countryside. As long as you go deep into the villages, you will understand the suffering of the farmers' lives. It is estimated that those who can fill their stomachs with coarse rice are already the richest in the village. Ordinary farmers are poorly clad, and their hard work for a year is not enough to pay for the military rice. They usually fill their stomachs with miscellaneous grains, and many even abandon their homes and flee. At present, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has not even included North Jiangsu in the scope of relief. North Jiangsu has been forgotten!

Yangzhou's commerce is still prosperous. The flour mill has resumed operation, but it only supplies the needs of the local troops. Although the power plant has restored electricity, there is insufficient coal, the light is dim, and the electricity bill is 600 yuan in legal tender per kilowatt-hour, which ordinary families cannot afford. Other prices are much more expensive than in Shanghai. Taking rice as an example, North Jiangsu used to be the granary of Jiangsu. In recent years, rice and grain cannot be shipped into the city for relief. The county town's food supply entirely relies on imports from South Jiangsu. The price of rice has soared to more than 30,000 yuan per stone. The people's livelihood is difficult, and the crisis is severe!

Speaking of Yangzhou's county administration, in the past enemy-puppet era, other than the baojia system being handled passably, there was nothing else worth mentioning. And the current government is just rehashing the old articles. Health and public construction are not taken seriously. Despite the garbage being all over the place and the stench overflowing, the "residence permit" is handled vigorously. In terms of education, things are simplified and educators have just received their January salaries this year. Working for the public on an empty stomach, their spirit of nurturing talents is truly admirable!

Since the Spring Festival, prices have soared. The price of gold took the lead, followed closely by the price of rice. Hoarding and manipulation are rampant. As a result, stores close early or hide their goods and refuse to sell. Therefore, the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. The gift that victory brought to the people is "a threat to life." Thinking about the future, it is difficult to imagine!

Spring is in Yangzhou, but how can the people of Yangzhou smell the breath of spring? So much poverty, so much displacement, so much hesitation, the vast Yangtze River, the misty white clouds, symbolize the suffering of the residents of North Jiangsu, continuously!

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### "No Way"?

— Hong Yimu

I have heard the phrase "no way" too often, especially when requesting something from higher authorities or superiors.

Originally, when something or a problem occurs, one should try to solve it, which naturally requires some thinking, some consideration, and sometimes a lot of brainstorming. Using the phrase "no way" to brush it off reduces a lot of trouble. This is the magic weapon for those who practice expediency.

The phrase "no way" is a narcotic for thought, an obstacle to progress. It obscures infinite light and cuts off the path of life. Those who always say there is no way are certainly self-abandoning laggards who will never have a future or happiness. Napoleon's dictionary did not have the word "difficult," meaning that he always found a way out of no way.

Conversely, it is foolish to insist that there is a way when there is really "no way." The warlords' military unification, the bureaucrats' dark and oppressive autocracy, Hitler's conquest of the world, these dreams, in the moment before their failure, did they not all claim to have a way?

Currently, the customers buying tickets at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Station are extremely crowded. Their clothes are torn, their shoes are trampled off, and those carrying luggage and goods are even more unimaginable. They have to queue up, with no place to put their luggage. They have to queue up for three or four hours, and they cannot even go to relieve themselves. Leaving the queue would risk being "left behind." Everyone sighs and laments.

I once asked the station managers why they did not try to improve the situation. They always replied that there were too many people and "there was no way." I think there are ways, but you just don't want to do them. The first way is to extend the ticketing hours. After one train leaves, sell tickets for the next train, one ticket at a time. Wouldn't that be great? Why wait until everyone is there before "opening," like watching a movie? The second way is to open more ticket windows. More ticket windows can reduce crowding. If you say that manpower is not economical, is it economical for thousands of people to queue up to buy tickets? You don't implement these methods and instead say "there is no way." I really "have no way" with these people!

There are many similar examples. For example, rising prices, the difficult lives of civil servants, rampant corruption, the bankrupt rural economy, these are all things that ordinary people think "there is no way" to solve. In my opinion, if we democratize politics, make a comprehensive plan for national affairs, restrain selfish and self-interested mentalities, treat other people's affairs as our own, and take into account the interests of the country and nation and the happiness of the people, then these problems can be easily solved.

### China's Mathematical Genius

— Wang Younong

This newspaper previously reported that Professor Hua Luogeng of Southwest Associated University was invited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to lecture in Moscow for two months. Then, our military department sent Hua and two other professors from the Associated University to the United States to study national defense science. Hua's experiences are little known. Here is a brief account:

Hua is from Jintan County, Jiangsu, and his family was very poor. His father ran a cotton retail shop, barely able to make a living. Therefore, after graduating from junior high school in his county, he only attended Shanghai Zhonghua Vocational School for one year before dropping out and working as an accounting assistant at his former junior high school. He was particularly interested in mathematics. He was very skilled and fast at using the abacus. He once ranked first in the school-wide abacus competition in Shanghai. In his home, whether it was an old newspaper or a used envelope, it was always covered with his calculations. He even continued to calculate while eating or defecating. Relying on diligent self-study and not being ashamed to ask questions, although he only had a junior high school education, he mastered all aspects of advanced algebra, calculus, and analytic geometry, whether in Japanese or Western texts. He was truly a mathematical genius. University students with difficult problems would come to him for help during their vacations, and he would always solve them immediately.

Around 1933 or 1934, he published papers on the theory of sixth-degree equations and the principle of imaginary numbers in the "Science" magazine of the China Science Society, which attracted great attention from the mathematical community. They thought he was at least a graduate of the mathematics department of a famous university. Later, through the introduction of a fellow villager, he became a temporary assistant in the mathematics department of Tsinghua University. Because he was very young, only twenty-four or twenty-five years old, and his qualifications did not even qualify him as a teaching assistant, the students in the mathematics department liked to study with him, and the department head gradually looked at him differently. Later, Hua made several discoveries in mathematical theory. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the school sent him to the United States to study for a while. He has been a full professor ever since. When Hua was in the United States, he studied mathematics and physics with Albert Einstein, the inventor of the theory of relativity, so he was also known internationally as a young mathematical prodigy.

Hua's left leg is crooked outward and cannot stand straight, so he walks in a rocking motion. This was because he had been bedridden for a long time when he was twenty years old, and he continued to read and calculate, only using his hands and brain, and forgetting to move his legs. As a result, the cartilage between his knee joints was invaded by bacteria and changed its shape. According to doctors at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, his left leg would have to be amputated and reassembled to be restored. It is not known whether this young mathematician has cured it during his studies in the United States, where medical technology is advanced.

From the above account of Hua's becoming a mathematical master, we can see that one does not necessarily have to rely on school education to study, nor does one necessarily have to have the best environment. For any subject, if one has a special interest and is determined and not afraid of hardship, one can always achieve good results.

### Establishing Good Customs

— Yang Mou

The establishment, change, or even disappearance of a custom, whether it is a good or bad custom, is not something that can be accomplished overnight. It requires countless perseverance and continuous efforts to accumulate before it can be effective. Perhaps humans are lazy creatures, so they attach particular importance to habits and even try to prevent the growth of new environments. Despite this, human civilization is progressing day by day, but the ugliness of human society still remains in many corners.

The rise of wartime profiteering has made many short-sighted people forget about learning and morality, and turn to the pursuit of money. This is the prevailing custom. Writers have reached the end of their road, and cultural workers have become the most unfortunate and pitiful insects in society. In this kind of atmosphere, the only things that people discuss are getting rich and making a fortune.

Everyone knows that whether it is in the officialdom, the business world, or even the education and cultural circles, there are many dark secrets. Of course, we cannot deny that many loyal and unyielding people are struggling hard, but everyone knows that there are also many unfilial people engaging in deceitful activities and living promiscuous and extravagant lives. Everyone knows that this is wrong, but everyone is still doing it, because this is the prevailing custom. Whoever does not plan for themselves seems to be a fool.

A good custom can prosper a country; a bad custom can destroy a country. Everyone is immersed in bad customs and knows that these customs are bad and can destroy the country, but no one has the courage to reform them, thinking, "What's the use of being the only one sober when everyone else is drunk?" Let's just be confused together! - Perhaps this is also a kind of custom, a custom that causes everyone to delay and procrastinate.

To put the country's politics, economy, culture, and all departments on the right track, the first step must be to establish good customs in each department. The establishment of these good customs is not the business of one person or one group, but should be the responsibility of everyone.

Bad customs are the cumulative result of years of badness, and we should mercilessly eliminate them. Good customs are the cumulative result of years of goodness, and we should carefully protect them. Furthermore, we should do everything we can to create new good customs!

Of the customs that fill society, how many are good? How many are bad? How many should be changed? How many should be eliminated? I think everyone must be able to understand! However, understanding alone is not enough. Everyone must lead by example and strive to achieve it.

### Social Service: Low Prices Actually Evolve into Black Markets

Speculative merchants manipulate at will, disregarding the lives of ordinary people. The government originally intended to help ordinary people by offering low-priced flour. The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has repeatedly revised the distribution method, reporting that ordinary people have the possibility of purchasing it, and limiting the price to 6,000 yuan per bag. The law is perfect, but some speculative merchants, relying on their large sums of money, manipulate at will and purchase in bulk, so that ordinary people, despite having the money, still sigh in vain. If they need it, they have no choice but to turn to the black market, where the price is 8,000 or 9,000 yuan per bag. If this continues, what can we imagine! The government's good intention of providing low-priced relief often backfires and completely enters the black market. Ordinary people cannot enjoy the benefits. How can this be called relief?

[Editor's Note] Recently, the general public has criticized the methods of the Enemy Property Administration and the Relief Branch for auctioning or selling daily necessities at low prices. This is because the large amount of materials sold are manipulated by a small number of speculative merchants, while the vast majority of ordinary people get nothing. For example, the cloth, sugar, fish, soap, flour, etc., that were sold off before. Public opinion is outraged, but the authorities insist on their own way. Now that the household survey has been completed and national identity cards have been issued, "rationing based on population" should be the fairest and most reasonable method. We hope that the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government will consider the people's difficulties, argue according to reason, and the common people will be fortunate!

### Good News for Poor Mothers

Prenatal Checkup Required

Recently, this column has received letters from residents of the Nanshi and former French Concession, inquiring about obstetrical hospitals with low fees and reliable surgery. We have learned that the Third District Health Center of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau at the intersection of Father Lu Road and Belle Road, and the Penglai Branch at 154 MinGuo Road, Ximen Road, have obstetrical departments that provide nearby delivery services day and night. However, a prenatal checkup is required. All expectant mothers living in the area can go there to contact them.
