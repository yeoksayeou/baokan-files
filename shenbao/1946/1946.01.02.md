### The Central Government Celebrated New Year's Morning. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Led a Remote Homage to the Mausoleum and Commended Officials and Civilians for Their Efforts in Nation-Building.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Today is the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, and also the first New Year's Day since the victory of the War of Resistance. The Central Government held a founding anniversary meeting at the National Government at 9:00 AM and paid remote homage to the Father of the Nation's Mausoleum. After the meeting, a New Year's group greeting ceremony was held. The atmosphere at the venue was pleasant, and the ceremony was solemn and respectful. Chairman Chiang, dressed in military uniform, attended the meeting. Most of the attendees wore formal attire, including Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Chuan Xian, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Zou Lu, Wang Chongzhuan, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, Shang Zhen, Cheng Qian, Bai Chongxi, Chen Guofu, Zhao Lizhi, Long Yun, Chen Bulei, Zhu Jiahua, He Chengjun, Wu Guozhen, Xiao Tongzi, Chen Qingyun, Zhang Dulun and over 300 others. First, they paid remote homage to the Father of the Nation's Mausoleum in the open space in front of the National Government. Chairman Chiang led the ceremony and presented flowers. Then, Chairman Chiang led a memorial meeting in the auditorium of the National Government. The Chairman delivered an impromptu speech, in which he severely reviewed the internal factors that led to China's invasion by Japan, and urged his colleagues to intensify their efforts in national reconstruction. The words were earnest and the tone was modest and amiable, which inspired everyone present. After the speech, the group greeting ceremony began. First, the entire assembly bowed three times to the Chairman, who returned the salute accordingly. Then, all civil and military officials bowed once to each other, and the ceremony concluded.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The Central Government celebrated the 35th New Year's Day at 9:00 AM on the 1st. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, he delivered an impromptu speech. The Chairman began by saying that the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of the national territory were due to the support of the national policy by the military and civilians in the front and rear, who volunteered their lives. The hard work and dedication of all civil and military comrades who worked together through thick and thin, sharing weal and woe, day and night for the past eight years, is also an indelible contribution to the War of Resistance. On behalf of the nation, I extend my sincere congratulations. Looking to the future, we deeply feel that the nation and the people have unlimited bright prospects, and that national revival and reconstruction today is a rare and fleeting opportunity of a millennium. It requires the spirit of sincere cooperation from the whole country, and we hope that colleagues in the government will have the awareness of self-correction, mutual encouragement, and daily renewal.

The Chairman then gave the following specific instructions on the current urgent political tasks, the reform of political conduct, and the improvement of administrative efficiency: (1) The repatriation work should be accelerated to complete it as soon as possible and start peacetime construction. All agencies should encourage and urge the receiving personnel to be responsible, law-abiding, honest, and self-disciplined. The land and materials taken over should be carefully organized and utilized to transform the useless into the useful and to allow the useful to fully exert its effectiveness. (2) Administrative efficiency should be fully improved. Last year's New Year's Day, I listed the necessity of "simplifying procedures," "thoroughly implementing government orders," and "loving the people." I hope that all comrades will be ambitious and self-reliant, and strive to live up to the expectations of modern civil servants so that government agencies can be sound and progressive. (3) Nation-building must first establish the ethos of nation-building. Last year's Double Tenth Festival, I proposed the three points of "new, fast, and practical" as the ethos of nation-building. We must strive for innovation, seize the time, and, most importantly, be practical in everything and strive for progress. The work of nation-building is undoubtedly more difficult than the War of Resistance. All responsible comrades must be diligent and be role models for the people in order to open up the scale of nation-building. (4) The spirit of taking responsibility automatically must be promoted. The most important thing for the responsible comrades of each agency is to be responsible and act vigorously. Any problem that falls within the scope of one's own duties must be taken responsibility for automatically, quickly resolved, and immediately implemented, without waiting for the supervision and promotion of superiors. In recent years, I have advocated a tiered responsibility system, the purpose of which is to cultivate our habit of self-reliance and self-respect, so as to handle affairs quickly and efficiently, and to clarify rights and responsibilities. (5) We should pay attention to connection and cooperation in handling affairs. Although the government agencies belong to different authorities, they are actually one entity. The same level agencies in each department should be closely linked and cooperate effectively. The central and local governments share common interests and concerns. They should care for each other and be consistent in order to achieve the effect of using fingers and arms. It must be known that the government's greatest responsibility is to seek happiness for the people and relieve their pain. Therefore, all agencies, whether central or local, must understand the needs of the people and realize their wishes.

Finally, the Chairman explained that although the War of Resistance has been won, the environment is still extremely difficult, and the work of nation-building is very important. The coming year will be the crux of the success or failure of our revolution and nation-building. At this time of the New Year's Day, I hope that all comrades will further develop their past achievements, get rid of the old and establish the new, to create a new atmosphere, exert new strength, and complete our sacred mission of building a new Three Principles of the People China in the repatriation work.

### Building a World of Lasting Peace. Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall Offer Mutual Congratulations on the Allied Victory

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] Chairman Chiang and his wife held a grand banquet at the Shantung Lin Yuan residence on the eve of the New Year's Day of the Republic of China's 35th year, commemorating the common victory of the Allies and celebrating Special Envoy Marshall's 66th birthday. Ambassadors to China, senior generals of the US military headquarters, central executive committee members, standing committee members, national government members, heads of various ministries and commissions, and chairpersons of the Political Council, totaling 151 people, attended. During the banquet, Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall gave speeches successively, mutually congratulating the Allied victory and permanent cooperation. The banquet ended at 10:30 PM with everyone thoroughly enjoying themselves.

Chairman Chiang's Speech

The year 1945 is quickly coming to an end. This is the most memorable year in human history. This year ended years of cruel and arrogant aggression and realized the common victory of our United Nations.

In order to commemorate our common victory, we are hosting our distinguished guest Marshal Marshall tonight, and today is also our distinguished guest's 66th birthday. We feel even more delighted with this union. Thinking of General Marshall's great contribution to winning this world victory, our gathering tonight has even greater significance. We not only welcome General Marshall's visit to China, but we can also celebrate the beginning of the New Year of 1946 with him. We should work even harder, just as we did in the past to achieve victory, in order to establish lasting world peace. General Marshall is a great man of action and few words. He emphasizes practicality rather than form. He has quick decision-making, lofty goals, and keen vision. He is truly a model of an outstanding soldier. These excellent qualities of his are worthy of everyone's emulation. I firmly believe that all my people, especially our national military officers and soldiers, will take him as our model. I have always admired General Marshall's career, just as President Truman praised General Marshall, "His contribution to the strategy of defeating Germany and Japan was greater than that of anyone else."

On behalf of the National Government and the Chinese people, I would like to extend my sincere respect to President Truman's special envoy, General Marshall, and welcome him to China. Now, please join me in raising a glass to the health of President Truman, to the great success and health and longevity of General Marshall, and to the common victory and lasting cooperation of our United Nations.

Marshall's Reply

I am very happy and honored that Chairman Chiang and his wife hosted a banquet for my birthday tonight. I will never forget this birthday every time I celebrate my birthday in the future.

I am ashamed of Chairman Chiang's mention of me in his speech. The meaning of the advancement or destruction of human civilization in the future depends on whether our societies and societies, countries and countries can cooperate. Therefore, our societies and societies, countries and countries, must cooperate, understand and be patient. As long as we can achieve this goal, lasting world peace will be guaranteed. Tonight, I would like to express my respect to Chairman Chiang and the Chinese people on behalf of President Truman. This respect is very sincere. I wish Chairman Chiang and his wife good health.

### Zang Qifang is in Charge of the Northeast Education Repatriation Work. It is Said that as Long as It Can Be Remedied, the Future is Still Extremely Optimistic

[Our newspaper, Peiping, 1st] Zang Qifang, the white-haired president of Northeast University, is currently in charge of the Northeast education repatriation work. Mr. Zang is not pessimistic about the shadow of the enslaved education imposed on the Northeast youth for the past fourteen years by the enemy and puppets, believing that as long as it can be remedied, the future is still extremely optimistic. Based on his experience in contacting Northeast school teachers and students in Changchun, the national and ethnic concepts of Northeast youth seem to be stronger and more vigorous than those of youth in the interior. Speaking of the principles of Northeast education repatriation, Mr. Zang said: We will try our best not to delay students' coursework and maintain their original grades as much as possible. The differences caused by the different school systems will be remedied as much as possible. In terms of teachers, Japanese teachers below the middle school level will be dismissed across the board. Research institutions can retain Japanese personnel without political backgrounds. As for general teachers, those who have acted as accomplices during the occupation will not be investigated for the past. In terms of textbooks, national standard or approved textbooks will be adopted completely, printed and distributed locally. As for the future development path of education, national education should strive for universalization, middle schools should focus on production education, and implement a 4-3-3 system, that is, ordinary middle schools account for 40%, vocational and normal schools each account for 30%, and university education should focus on gifted education. In the past fourteen years, the quantitative aspect of Northeast education has developed greatly, with 2.1 million elementary school students, 600,000 middle school students, and 30,000 university students. However, the qualitative aspect is extremely insufficient. Very few universities have liberal arts departments, and agriculture, engineering, and medicine departments are also developing abnormally. The enemy really does not give Northeast youth the opportunity to study political and social issues.

### The United Nations Military Council Has Requested. Our Government Dispatches Commander-in-Chief He to Attend as Representative

It will start working on New Year's Day to handle unfinished matters, with Tan Boyu as the director and Fu Jingbo as the deputy director.

[Our newspaper, Peiping, 1st] President Song's main task in Peiping is to restart those motors that have been mostly dormant after being received, so that they can rotate again for China's repatriation and nation-building. In addition to a few most necessary receptions, President Song stayed in Jurenhui Hall almost all day long, discussing with relevant ministries and commissions which agencies should receive enemy and puppet industries, how to resume work, and how to raise funds for resuming work. It is said that several principles have been initially determined: (1) Factories of the same nature that have not started work will be merged and started. (2) Factories set up by the enemy and puppets for temporary wartime needs, and which currently lack markets or uses, will be shut down across the board. (3) All kinds of economic institutions set up by the enemy during the war will be abolished across the board.

### The Hope for Unity is Growing Stronger. Yan'an will Soon Reply to the Peace Proposal

[Our newspaper] San Francisco, broadcast at 2:00 AM on the 2nd: According to the latest news, the hope for unity in China is stronger than ever before. It is said that in the talks between the two major political parties in China last night, the National Government put forward a substantial peace proposal, to which Yan'an will pass a resolution and reply within 48 hours.

[Our newspaper] San Francisco, broadcast at midnight on the 1st: In response to the Communist Party's request for a ceasefire, Chairman Chiang will allow the Communist Party to participate in the coalition government, but the Communist Party must abandon its independent army.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 1st] Chairman Chiang has formally asked General Marshall, the U.S. special envoy to China, to mediate peace between the government and the Communist Party.

[United Press, Chongqing, 31st] Neutral politicians believe that Chairman Chiang's New Year's Day speech to the military and civilians shows that the National Government is prepared to establish a coalition government in order to peacefully resolve the civil war, but they point out that Chairman Chiang's speech contains several conditions, such as the disbandment of the Communist army and administrative organs, the cessation of the Communist army's attempts to sabotage transportation, and the obstruction of the National Army's reception and occupation of areas. They pointed out that Chairman Chiang did not mention the Yellow River or the Northeast, nor did he address the Communist Party's proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. They believe that this indicates that the National Army's political and military position is becoming increasingly strong, no different from a warning to Communist leader Mao Zedong, "Stop all acts of disobedience, and then we can begin negotiations." Chairman Chiang has decided to convene the National Assembly on May 5th. Although the Communist Party still opposes this, Chairman Chiang does not intend to change this decision and has indicated that he is willing to increase the number of Communist Party representatives.

[United Press, Chongqing, 31st] The China Democratic League sent a letter to the National Government and the Communist Party, requesting that a "ceasefire" order be issued on New Year's Day of the 35th year to "give the people a new beginning."

### National Army Recaptures Fuxin; Liu Duoquan Arrives in Jinzhou to Join the Army Heading to Rehe

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] According to reports received today, the National Army has recaptured Fuxin, located 70 miles northeast of Jinzhou. Simultaneously, other troops are advancing towards Xinmin, 30 miles northwest of PanYang, and the areas of Yingkou and Chaoyang.

[Beiping, This Newspaper, 31st] Rehe, which has been occupied for twelve years, is about to return to the embrace of the motherland. This morning, Liu Duoquan led his secretary, Mo Songheng, civil constitution director Tan Wenbin, construction director Mao Shaoqing, and 22 senior officials from various provincial committees, leaving Beiping by plane to Jinzhou to advance with the army. The National Army on that front had already advanced to Yixian when Liu left Jinzhou, and it is expected that Chaoyang and Lingyuan will soon be recovered. Once the National Army enters those areas, the provincial government personnel will follow the army in to begin their work. Before his departure, Liu paid visits to President Song, Li Zongren, and Xiong Shihui, and had detailed discussions regarding the takeover of Rehe. The province will also use the Northeast circulation currency in the future, as the monetary system in the region has rapidly become unified with that of Manchukuo over the past twelve years. The special commissioner dispatched by the Central Bank to Jin County has recently requested the authorities to establish a branch bank in Rehe Province to handle financial matters.

[Jinzhou, Central News Agency, 1st] Rehe Chairman Liu Duoquan led the heads of various departments of the provincial government and important officials to Jinzhou at noon on the 31st. They will follow the takeover troops from Fuxin into Rehe to assist the troops in starting to promote the political affairs of Rehe Province.

[Qing, United Press, 31st] It is reported that the National Army has launched a large-scale pincer military operation, with its powerful flanks steadily advancing towards Rehe Province.

Communist Troops Retreat from Changchun; Mo Dehui Inspects Police Stations

[Beiping, This Newspaper, 1st] A person from Changchun said: The current situation in Changchun is not much different from a month ago, except that the municipal government has been taken over, the Central Bank has opened, and the ground is covered with snow. Although the mayors of Harbin and Shenyang, who arrived in Changchun, have taken office, they find it difficult to predict the future of the takeover and generally adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The Communist troops have retreated from Changchun, but individuals resembling Communist soldiers can still be seen in the city. After 5:00 PM, people still keep their doors closed, as do personnel from the Administrative Headquarters. Allies generally have a very good impression of the Northeast, so many have purchased properties in Changchun and other places. Because they cannot distinguish clearly, some have mistakenly purchased public property, which will be a major problem when dealing with enemy and puppet property in the Northeast in the future. There are currently four rear reporters in Changchun, all of whom are unusually depressed and unable to express their suffering.

[Changchun, Central News Agency, 31st] Mo Dehui inspected the police station and detention center here on New Year's Eve and gave a speech to the officers, encouraging them to perform their sleepless duties with the heart of a strict father and kind mother. The bureau has only been taken over by the new director for four days, and public security in the city has already improved.

### Coordinating Materials and Technology to Complete Our Transportation Construction

— Yu Feipeng

The New Year of the 25th year of the Republic of China, also the first New Year after the victory of the War of Resistance, looking back at the past and forward to the future, the deep wounds and great pain make us more vigilant!

Our country has an area of over four million square miles and a population of nearly 450 million, but its industry is backward and its transportation is inadequate. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, national political decrees gradually became unified, and active progress was made in transportation. Up to 1937, the country had a total of 17,232 kilometers of railways, over 1,400 locomotives, over 22,000 passenger and freight cars, 115,702 kilometers of highways, 62,001 automobiles, 20,333 kilometers of navigable waterways, 540 ships with 576,875 tons, and 29 airplanes. We were planning to continue construction and strive for prosperity and strength. Unexpectedly, the July 7th Incident occurred, and foreign aggression suddenly arrived. The painstakingly managed transportation infrastructure was frequently destroyed by military operations. In the eight years since then, only 1,459 kilometers of railways remained operational in the rear, with 206 locomotives and 2,843 passenger and freight cars. There were 52,123 kilometers of highways, 11,423 automobiles, and only 6,648 kilometers of inland waterways, with less than 70,000 tons of ships and 58 airplanes. With this extremely small number of transportation tools, we had to cope with the arduous task of war. In addition, enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed, making repairs difficult, and the Yunnan-Burma Road was blocked, resulting in a lack of foreign aid. The difficulties and hardships reached an unbearable level. Fortunately, all employees persevered despite the dangers, fulfilled their duties, and were finally able to overcome the environment and win victory. This cannot but be praised as a great achievement in the history of the War of Resistance. According to reports, 1,652 of our transportation employees were injured on official duty, and 4,186 sacrificed their lives. Their heroic spirit is truly commendable.

Now, many Allied countries have already implemented demobilization, but China has suffered the most due to the long-term war of resistance. Counting the original transportation equipment in the rear, together with what has recently been taken over, excluding the provinces of the Northeast and Taiwan, which have no accurate statistics, there are 12,240 kilometers of railways, over 117,000 kilometers of highways, ×××× locomotives, ××××× passenger and freight cars, ××××× automobiles, and ×××× ships. However, due to prolonged use, many are dilapidated and in need of repair. Calculated according to the area and population of our country, the actual needs are far from being met, and bandits are constantly destroying facilities, hindering demobilization and transportation, which has a great impact. In the future, to coordinate the overall transportation needs, the key lies in striving for construction. In addition to having drafted a five-year transportation construction plan for the post-war period, which has been submitted for approval for phased implementation, this year, at a minimum, the following matters must be handled vigorously.

Regarding railways, we plan to repair the destroyed railways in the recovered areas as quickly as possible to restore full operation. At the same time, we will reorganize management institutions, improve personnel systems, and increase transportation efficiency. We will also request the government to order various railway materials from abroad to prepare for the construction of various lines. Regarding shipping, in addition to maximizing the use of existing and taken-over enemy and puppet ships, reasonably allocating them, and assigning them to the Yangtze River and coastal demobilization work, we will also request the government to order ships from abroad to develop ocean shipping. Regarding highways, we will complete the national network according to the plan, unify engineering standards, set up bureaus in different regions for management, actively organize business, and establish local transportation institutions and support the opening of private companies, so that engineering and transportation can be handled separately. Regarding telecommunications, we will temporarily rely on radio as the main means to undertake communication between the rear and the recovered areas in the short term. At the same time, we will continue to repair and strengthen wired telecommunications equipment in various places to meet military and political needs. Regarding postal savings and remittances, because they have a considerable foundation in the past, and the takeover situation is also relatively smooth, we will only strive to improve and develop them universally in the future, and truly achieve the goal of serving the people. Regarding aviation, in this demobilization, the China and Central Aviation Companies have made their best efforts to transport important personnel and military supplies, and the government should provide support to promote their soundness. At the same time, we will actively develop civil aviation to meet international trends.

Furthermore, transportation is closely related to military affairs, culture, economy, agriculture, industry, and all other aspects of administration. Today, the transportation of water, land and air in various countries is developing and expanding rapidly. During the war period, progress was unusually rapid, and the technological improvements after the war will be even more rapid. All of this is the achievement of coordinating talent and materials. In the future construction of our country, all major transportation tools will inevitably rely on imports from abroad, and the use of these new tools requires a large number of employees with specialized skills to be competent. Looking at the country's transportation talents, we feel a great lack, and the level of technology is difficult to match. Therefore, cultivating and training specialized technical talents is an essential plan. We should catch up to achieve success. We deeply hope that domestic talents and people from allied countries will continue to help us complete the construction of transportation with the enthusiasm for guiding us in the past. We will see the development of transportation, the prosperity of the local economy, and we will surely make a contribution to the international community.

### Emperor Issues Edict Willing to Lead the People on the Path to Democracy; MacArthur Expresses Gratitude in Statement Yesterday

[Tokyo, Reuters, 1st] Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, General MacArthur, recently issued a statement expressing his approval of the Emperor's New Year's Edict. He stated, "I was very pleased to hear the Emperor's words. The Emperor is ready to lead the Japanese people in a democratic life, taking responsibility for their future freedom. The Emperor's determination can demonstrate the strength of a powerful ideology, an ideology that will never be suppressed." MacArthur's remarks are the first public expression of official support for the Japanese Emperor, and are therefore worthy of attention. The fact that the Emperor should be listed as a war criminal and put on trial has been a point of contention.

[Tokyo, United Press, 1st] Emperor Hirohito today issued an edict to the Japanese people, declaring that the Emperor is not sacred and inviolable, and that the Japanese are not the most superior race. MacArthur was deeply gratified and said that the Emperor had begun to lead the Japanese people on the path to democracy, clearly adopting a liberal and laissez-faire attitude towards Japan's future.

[Tokyo, United Press, 31st] In order to abolish Shintoism in Japan, MacArthur issued an order today prohibiting the use of history, geography, and ethics textbooks in all Japanese schools unless they have been approved by MacArthur's headquarters. These textbooks and teaching methods will be confiscated. According to Lieutenant General Dyke, head of the MacArthur Information Education Group, these textbooks are full of nationalistic ideas and must be thoroughly revised. MacArthur's order is not because the Japanese are lazy in reforming the content of their textbooks, but rather because he wants to implement his previous plans to reform Japanese education. The Ministry of Education has been ordered to develop alternative teaching materials and prepare a new textbook compilation plan. These temporary textbooks will be available to schools next spring after they have been completed. All confiscated textbooks will be destroyed and used to make wood pulp to print new books.

### Emperor Announces to the People Yesterday: The Emperor is Not Sacred and Inviolable; Please Abandon the Illusion of Japanese Superiority

[Tokyo, United Press, 1st] Emperor Hirohito issued an edict to the people on New Year's Day, saying: Japan has suffered a disastrous defeat after years of war, and the people inevitably feel uneasy and disappointed, which is of great concern to me. Drastic changes are taking place in the country, and the people's morality is deteriorating, resulting in a tendency for the people's thinking to fall into confusion. I stand with the people, sharing their joys and sorrows, and united on the basis of mutual trust and love, rather than on unfounded myths and legends. The Emperor is not sacred and inviolable, and the Japanese are not the most superior race in the world, born to rule the world. If the Japanese people can be strong and united, overcome the current difficulties, and enjoy civilized life in peace, then not only Japan, but the future of all mankind, will tend towards brightness. Emperor Meiji promulgated five oaths between 1868 and 1912, which were recorded in the constitution, stipulating that the Japanese people had the right to speak out in politics, guaranteeing that all people were treated equally, increasing the knowledge of the people, and making the empire more prosperous. The importance of these high-minded warnings need not be said, and I now wish to reiterate these oaths so that Japan can restore its independence. The principles contained in the oaths in the chapters must be observed, and we must move forward bravely, eliminate all past mistakes, earnestly understand the people's demands, and build a new Japan. The whole country, from top to bottom, will obtain a richer culture in peaceful years, and the level of the people will also be improved. I have decided to revive the five oaths enshrined in the Japanese Charter with an indomitable spirit: (1) Establish a parliament, and all government measures should be based on public opinion. (2) The whole country, from top to bottom, should unite together to actively promote national politics. (3) All the people of the country should be the same as the civil and military officials, and can realize their legitimate hopes, so as not to be dissatisfied. (4) Past statutes will still be observed, and all actions will be based on fairness and integrity. (5) Strive to increase the people's knowledge and status to promote the happiness of the empire.

### Byrnes Discusses the Control of Japan Again

[Washington, United Press, 31st] US Secretary of State Byrnes told reporters today that General MacArthur did not know about the developments at the Moscow Conference. His views were obtained before the meeting of the three foreign ministers. Byrnes still praised MacArthur's administration, saying that the War Department and the State Department have reached a consensus on the method of governing Japan. He said that the British representative in Europe strongly advocated changing the policy of governing Japan, and said that the Soviet Union was not as serious in this regard as Australia. He insisted that he believed that the Moscow Agreement fully supported MacArthur's power. MacArthur has stated that he will seek to implement it, and Byrnes is confident that this plan can be implemented. When asked whether MacArthur's power includes the formation of policy, Byrnes said that the formation of policy is the responsibility of the president. Byrnes said that as far as he is concerned, if he does not discuss with MacArthur, who can provide "valuable advice," he does not intend to draft any plans.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Three New Taxes

[Tokyo, United Press, 1st] The "Mainichi Shimbun" reported today that the Japanese cabinet has passed draft bills for three new taxes, including a wartime excess profits tax, a private production increase tax, and a property tax, which will be submitted to MacArthur for approval.

### Lawrence Broadcasts to Indians, Willing to Help India Achieve Autonomy; This Year Will Be a Test Period for India's New Life; Attlee Meets with British Delegation to India

[London, Reuters, 1st] Indian Affairs Minister Lawrence broadcast to the Indians tonight, saying: "1946 will be a trial period in India's history. The British government and the British people sincerely want to see India quickly achieve complete freedom and become an equal member of the British Commonwealth. We will do our best to assist India to reach this status. There is no need to use criticism or organized pressure to gain recognition of India's rightful place in the world. This era is over. The current problem is a practical one, and a reasonable and acceptable plan of action must be formulated. According to this plan, power can be transferred to an Indian government supported by the Indian people, so that the new India will not be destroyed by civil strife and disputes again. For the welfare of India and the entire world, this is absolutely necessary. The new institutions of the world need strong members who contribute to peace, so internal coordination is a prerequisite."

[London, Reuters, 1st] Prime Minister Attlee met with Indian Affairs Minister Lawrence and the entire delegation of visiting Indian parliamentarians at the Prime Minister's residence yesterday. The delegation is scheduled to depart for India tomorrow. According to the head of the delegation, Lee, to reporters, this trip is purely a goodwill visit. We have no official positions. After returning this time, we do not intend to submit another report on the Indian issue. As a member of the Empire, we deeply wish to see the situation on the ground in India. All parties in Britain feel that the British government has a need to fulfill its promises to India. However, most of this problem is an internal problem. We should assist the Indian people with different views to seek a common solution.

In this atomic age, if the fate of mankind is to be decided by peace and goodwill, then only the truth and non-violence theories proclaimed by Gandhi can achieve this goal. Among the humans fighting for peace in the world today, Gandhi is more powerful than any spokesperson of the great powers claiming to "love peace."

### Zhejiang Province's Education Reform Plan: Director Xu Shaodi's Statement to Reporters

[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou] Xu Shaodi, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, has served for eleven years and has been particularly diligent during the eight years of the war. He recently told reporters about the future reform plan for education in Zhejiang Province in great detail. It is recorded as follows:

On the return trip to Hangzhou from Yunhe, the scars of war were everywhere, and many school buildings were severely damaged, causing great loss of vitality. It may take two or three years to restore the previous appearance. Although the war has ended, the continuous relocation of schools back to their original sites is still a refugee-style movement. While the enthusiasm of various parties to restore schools and the assistance given to schools by enthusiastic individuals are indeed present, the situations of certain unwarranted destruction and losses after the victory are too painful to speak of.

Lenient Handling of Screening

Furthermore, the regional distribution of schools has been adjusted during the war. This time, I originally intended to make an overall plan and distribution according to the original plan to make it more reasonable. Unfortunately, it is impossible to implement this across the board due to traditional concepts in various aspects. The local governments themselves will decide on the screening and assessment of teachers in the recovered areas. As for the reorganization of the student registers from the puppet schools, this should be done through examinations. Studying at schools run by the puppet government will inevitably be affected by the yoke of enslavement education. However, most young people seek education out of necessity due to their environment, which is different from defecting to the enemy. Screening should be handled leniently, and some should be given remedial education, after which they can be screened and assigned to various schools or transferred to other schools. Chairman Huang raised the slogan "Education First" after the victory of the war, but it goes without saying that national reconstruction depends on education.

Emphasis on Science Education

In this world war, victory and defeat were determined by science. A country with backward science, even if it has the name of a strong country, will not have the reality of a strong country. After Japan's surrender, it was said that Japan's defeat was a failure of science, and China's victory was a victory of diplomacy, which has profound meaning. There were many shortcomings in the past education system, which is undeniable. As for the decline in quality during the war, there were some natural factors at play. Most people's criticisms on this point are like scratching an itch from afar and not quite hitting the mark. There are many points that should be reformed in the future. Therefore, future education expansion plans are complex and cannot be explained in a few words. However, it can be asserted that we should attach importance to scientific research. Therefore, replenishing equipment, etc., is a matter of urgent need. Education is a century-long project of nurturing talents, and it cannot be done in a hurry. Even in terms of recovery, after eight years of destruction, it is not possible to achieve the goal of recovery overnight. The province's improvement plan should be implemented in stages.

This Year is Education Year

After Chairman Huang proposed that the 35th year of the Republic (1946) be the Education Year, it is planned to raise 300,000 dan of stored grain, with an additional 200,000 dan levied and 100,000 dan solicited to serve as a supplementary fund for educational undertakings, which will be continued annually. Most of this funding will be used to replenish equipment. School education should focus on quality over quantity. The Chairman's idea is that success in the century-long plan does not have to be by us alone, so the plan should be as far-reaching as possible. This is a long-term plan, and it is hoped that it can be implemented throughout.

Increase Teachers' Salaries

At the same time, in order to emphasize educational undertakings, teachers' salaries should be increased to be higher than those of civil servants. Also, because most outstanding young people are from poor families, equal educational opportunities should be provided, so we should find ways to provide them with subsidies so that they can pursue further studies. The Administrative Council has passed a resolution, and this Department can formulate implementation measures based on the principles outlined above. [Butterfly]

### Ministry of Education's Jiangsu-Anhui Supervision Office: Investigation of Loyalty in Education Circles

[Dispatch from Bengbu, Dahua News Agency] The Ministry of Education's Jiangsu-Anhui Supervision Office, in view of the fact that Jiangsu and Anhui bore the brunt of the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, fell into enemy hands early, and suffered deeply, believes that during this period, the education circles must have had people who generously rushed to their doom and calmly embraced martyrdom. These individuals are urgently in need of commendation to encourage righteousness. Therefore, a loyalty investigation form has been specially made, and party, government, and education agencies in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces are requested to instruct all counties to conduct thorough investigations so as to submit them to the Ministry of Education and request the National Government to issue commendations.

### Central Polytechnic Plans to Return to Nanjing: Building School Buildings Requires 3 Billion Yuan

[Dispatch from Chongqing via air, Dazhong News Agency] Since being approved to move back to Nanjing, the Central Polytechnic has convened a re-establishment committee to actively formulate a re-establishment plan with far-reaching and meticulous content, divided into three steps: relocation, replenishment, and expansion. Within one year, all current teachers and students can be moved back to Nanjing. Within five years, the eight departments of specialty and vocational departments, including machinery, civil engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, aviation, architecture, textile, and mining and metallurgy, can be fully completed. In the future, it is also planned to add an engineering college, attached junior high school and elementary school. If this plan is fully completed, it can become the most complete industrial school with three to four thousand students. However, the Nanjing school buildings of the school have been completely destroyed. This move back will require reconstruction. Engineers are currently drawing design plans, and the initial budget is 300 million yuan, which has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for review. Once approved, personnel will be sent to Beijing to start construction.

### Football League Opened Yesterday: Hequn and Korean Residents Each Draw
No Score in the First Half

The new Shanghai Football League opened its prelude yesterday on New Year's Day. In the afternoon's inaugural Group A match, Hequn drew with Korean Residents 2-2. The Jiaozhou Concession situation was still considered enthusiastic.

Korean Residents, incarnated as Jilin, in addition to their tough style, yesterday had a performance of tacit understanding and skilled short passing. However, the shots lacked accuracy. In the first half, Hequn seemed to have forgotten to bring their "shooting shoes," resulting in a score of zero for both teams. Two minutes into the second half, Korean Residents had a good opportunity for a penalty kick, which was taken by center back Li Shidong, but it hit Yao Chong's chest, and the opportunity was lost. Nine minutes after the start of the second half, Xiao Ziwen opened the scoring with a low shot from 15 yards in front of the goal. In the 36th minute, Korean right forward Jin Wenxuan sprinted straight down, and Yao Chong rushed out too late, was lightly touched by Jin, and went diagonally into the lower left corner, making it 1-1. Four minutes later, Korean left forward Huang Chongchun intercepted the ball 20 yards out and sent a high left-footed shot that floated into the upper right corner. Yao was caught off guard, and Korean Residents took the lead 2-1. One minute later, Hequn counterattacked, reaching deep under the goal. Korean goalkeeper Hong Puzhi bounced the ball on the ground, and Xiao Ziwen took the opportunity to bump into it, leaking in from under his arm. Hequn gained this unexpected harvest and drew 2-2.

The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:

Hequn drew with Korean Residents (Group A) 2-2

Longjie defeated Yong'an (Group B) 4-0

Zhenru defeated Yong'an (Group C1) 2-1

Haihua defeated Yangshao (Group C1) 5-0

Huaguang defeated Nanyou (Group C2) by default

Maoxiong defeated Yuanzi (Group C2) by default

Commentary

### On the Interpretation of Freedom of Speech

— Zhang Shizhao

This year marks the first year of the motherland's recovery. As we step into the ranks of powerful nations, with the resplendent banner of constitutional government, it is truly a grand occasion that the people of our nation will henceforth enjoy the rights of freedom. However, what is the meaning of freedom? What kind of enjoyment is it? From the government to the common people, there may not be a clear concept. Here, I would like to take freedom of speech as an example to explain it.

Our country's modern legal thought, flowing from Japan, originated from the Continent. The continental legal system distinguishes freedom and imposes various restrictions, which is different from the complete laissez-faire of the Anglo-American system. Our legal thinking has been immersed in the Continental system for a long time. Therefore, as soon as the Republic was established, press laws were written unexpectedly. In the first year of the Republic, the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Nanjing, with the current President of the Judicial Yuan as the Vice Minister, promulgated three articles of this law, which caused a great uproar in the Shanghai newspapers. At that time, I was writing for the Minli Bao, the organ of the Tongmenghui, and I also spoke based on Anglo-American law, saying:

"To truly understand freedom of the press in England, nothing is better than the words of Mansfield. Mansfield, as a famous judge, drew a line, saying: 'Freedom of the press is nothing else but the freedom to publish without seeking special permission in advance. Only when illegal events occur after publication can they be dealt with according to law.' Ellenborough, also a famous judge, also said: 'English law is the source of freedom. Freedom is named in contrast to special permission. The two words 'special permission' are actually useless in national law. If a person wants to publish, then publish it; there is no other operation. As for illegal acts, they must be judged, just like other illegal events, and there is nothing unique about publishing.' The words of the two families are like this. Those who slander press laws are not press laws. That which can be called a press law is nothing more than special permission, censorship, and security deposits. The press laws of the former Qing Dynasty had all three. Now the Ministry of Internal Affairs only marks the item of special permission. Looking at the constitution of England, it is entirely built on personal rights. Although this seems to be a special feature of the English constitution, in fact, the nature of the constitution should be like this. Why do I say this? If someone wants to write a book to his friend, this is an inherent freedom. If this person wants to publish his book for public viewing, this is also an inherent freedom. Furthermore, if this person wants to write good deeds to his friend every day, and wants to publish his book for public viewing every day, and increase the number to hundreds of millions of copies, this is also an inherent freedom. Why wait to ask? The former is called freedom of communication, and the latter is called freedom of publication. These two freedoms are not different things. If freedom of publication must be specially permitted, then why is freedom of communication unique? Extending this, if A wants to speak to B, this is his freedom; if B wants to speak to C and D, this is his freedom; this does not require special permission. If A wants to speak to B in a certain place, and B wants to speak to C and D in a certain place, if A and B want to speak to C and D together in a certain place, must they wait for special permission? The former is called freedom of speech, and the latter is called freedom of assembly. Knowing this principle, then it should be the inevitable order of freedom for A and B to speak to C, D, E, F, and even hundreds of millions of people, to speak together in a certain place every day, and to publish their common words in a certain place every day, up to hundreds of millions of copies. Why is that? That is freedom of the press. Professor Dicey, a famous figure in the English constitution, does not go beyond this."

I restate this passage with deep emotion. The three articles of the press law issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs at that time were extremely ordinary, only requiring publishers to register. However, in the early days of the Republic, the banner of freedom was suddenly raised. With a loud cry, the government retreated accordingly. In the end, the so-called three articles of the press law were withdrawn by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the matter was over. However, later, when Yuan Shikai was in power, and other Beiyang governments after him, all kinds of press restrictions were issued with increasing intensity. The National Government, under the name of tutelage, made this law even stricter, which everyone knows. Therefore, the country's speech, regardless of high or low, urgent or slow, large or small, light or heavy, has shrunk under layers of control. From the beginning to the end, it has become increasingly decadent. Who would say otherwise? However, since Nanjing established its authority, it has been more than thirty years, and the flower of freedom has bloomed and never withered. The so-called press laws have never been seen. May I ask, are the public and private discussions in our country far in line with the standards of the ancient sages, close to the virtues of the worthy officials, elegant and graceful in normal times, and generous and vigorous in times of change? Do they only express themselves when appropriate, and when they do, are they moderate, skillfully following the principles of the upper class, wise as measures, and clearly exhibiting their views without contradicting themselves? The passers-by can say definitively, no, no. Why not? It is because the gentlemen of today are not capable of advocating this kind of freedom.

Some may ask, this kind of freedom is what the new laws advocate. Is our old morality insufficient to cope with it? I say, no. The truth of the matter is that, considering time, space, and the ability to act, I only fear that old morality is not firm enough. Once it is firm, freedom will use it to enhance its use. Why worry about obstructing the law? Confucius said, "The way of the gentleman is rooted in himself, verified by the common people, examined by the Three Kings without error, established in heaven and earth without contradiction, questioned by ghosts and spirits without doubt, and waits for the sages of a hundred generations without confusion." This is the ultimate achievement of the ancient sages, which is the scope of freedom. Why do I say this? When people are first born, they are ignorant and primitive. They speak when they want to speak, and say what they want to say, without any so-called education or etiquette. After education and etiquette arise, they begin to know that the speaker is for himself, and the listener is for others. Acting directly according to one's feelings has its inconveniences. This is the state of the individual and the common people in the Doctrine of the Mean. Going further than this, the realm of ghosts and spirits, the brightness of heaven and earth, the past of the Three Kings, and the future of the sages of a hundred generations, must all be extended from oneself and the common people to the fullest extent, in order to seek harmony with each other. Talking about this is called freedom, but in fact it is extremely unfree. Sages are representatives who can accommodate themselves in extreme unfreedom, with room to spare. In the history of mankind, there are only a few sages, and therefore there are only a few who truly understand freedom. What does the country rely on to place this freedom that is hoped for but cannot be immediately achieved? I say, no. The principle is one, but there are differences in degree, importance, and weight. Speaking of the extreme, there are things that even sages cannot do. Speaking in general, even the foolish and the ignorant can understand. The sage even more earnestly and clearly established the meaning for the ignorant masses, saying: "Is there one word that can be practiced for a lifetime? It is tolerance!" Tolerance is like one's heart. In fact, it is nothing more than using one's own heart to measure the hearts of others. Holding this to regulate freedom will allow you to move forward without obstruction. Standing in heaven and earth, wanting to be called upright, although wisdom and ability are said to be unequal, making it difficult to understand the intricacies, it is still possible to clearly point out the differences between oneself and others. It is hard to believe that people do not know how to explain the word "tolerance." Therefore, common people say that old morality is not suitable for new freedom. There is no such thing.

As for the meaning of new morality in relation to freedom, it is even more open. An English proverb says: "Freedom is freedom, but it should be bounded by the freedom of others." Raising the word "boundary" is consistent with the Confucius's discussion of oneself and others, and even ghosts, spirits, heaven, earth, the Three Kings, and the sages of a hundred generations. In the past, Mill wrote a book on freedom, whose meaning was extremely clear. Yan Jidao translated it as "The Limits of Individual and Social Authority." Although it is not without the loss of meaning in making a name, it is still a satisfactory and valuable title. To say that the people of our country are not able to enjoy freedom is no different from saying that the people of our country do not know what those boundaries are. Gentlemen, ask yourselves, what do you think?

I have said that the government's restriction of freedom, in the end, there are still some unrestricted areas. Use them well, and there may still be room for manoeuvre. Why do I say this? When the government does not restrict, I will secretly set up various obstacles to encourage myself. Now, what the government has set up is only ink rules. Although the former is also a restriction and the latter is also a restriction, their scope may not necessarily overlap. Even if my freedom is extremely pure, it must still enter and exit through layers of inspection. The question is, what kind of inspection do the people of the country want to preserve, and what kind do they want to eliminate? Also, what kind of inspection does the government want to uphold, and what kind does it want to allow to be released?

Being timid in public battles and brave in private fights is the inferiority of the national character. Restraining speech will lead to laziness in advocating and diligence in attacking, which corresponds to this. Moreover, the intensity of the attack depends on the strength of the opposing force. Those who are reckless and see no future consequences will use force violently. This is to wipe out justice and only target people to vent personal anger. It is truly the worst of the worst, difficult to sort out. In a word, it is the lack of clarity between public and private, and the lack of standards in speech.

As for the effect of tutelage, it has nothing to do with freedom. Tutelage is the technique of Mozi's advocating of conformity. Mozi said: "What the superior affirms, all must affirm; what the superior denies, all must deny. Praising those who conform to the superior and do not compare with the inferior is what the superior rewards and the inferior praises. Abandoning bad speech and learning the good speech of the ruler; abandoning bad deeds and learning the good deeds of the ruler. How can we understand the governance of the state? It is because the ruler can unify the meaning of the state, and therefore the state is governed." This is the ultimate goal of tutelage. Those who specialize in the organs of propaganda are focused on this. As for freedom, it is the opposite. Freedom is what gives rise to differences. I once wrote a "Theory of the Basis of Politics," which began by stating: "There is a basis for politics. Where is the basis? I say, it lies in tolerance. What is tolerance? I say, it is not liking conformity and disliking difference." This is not my personal opinion. Walter Bagehot once valued the fierce debate in Parliament, saying that English politics first takes the evaluation of politics as politics. The government party is called the King's Servant in political terminology, and the opposition party is called the King's Opposition Party. Taking the King as the target and focusing the arrows on him makes the King the focal point of the world. This not only violates the principle of conformity advocated by Mozi, but also rebels against the principle that the monarch cannot do evil. Therefore, when this statement first came out, the world was quite shocked, but the British eventually adopted it as law and achieved the highest principle. May said: "The virtue of a political party lies first in listening to the opinions of the opposition party." Mill said: "The use of the two parties is that one is necessary for the existence of the other because the other is insufficient. Its benefit to the country lies in the fact that they attack each other and do not agree, which can restrain the power of the acting rulers and make them always follow reason and be aware." This is how the British make good use of their freedom. In a word, it is the five characters I wrote in my article: "Not liking conformity and disliking difference."

Today, people talk about politics and like to promote England and America, but we are only imitating them with heart. Freedom is one of its main points, but freedom cannot come without a reason, nor can it be obtained by simply opening one's mouth. I used to hold Dicey's saying, deeply fearing that it would give people a sense of ease. Now, please let me use Bagehot's words to refute it.

"Judging by civilization, even our England is quite remarkable, but among them, there are many people whose knowledge is no different from that of the majority two thousand years ago, and the others who are better are no better than the so-called outstanding talents of a thousand years ago. Otherwise, how can there be so many people in the lower and middle classes of society who are narrow-minded, stubborn, and numb! Do those who hear this doubt my words? Then try to return to your home, go to your kitchen, and speak to the cooking woman or the chef, using the principles that you think are the clearest, most fluent, and most certain, but they think are obscure, incomprehensible, and absurd. If what you have gained from delving into the depths, now only speak of the most accessible to the people, but they think is far-fetched, wild, and heretical, then my saying is not false. It must be known that a large group is like a large mountain, whose substance has many layers. Only the group's transformation also has it, and the characteristics of its lower layer are closer to the ancient times than to the upper layer. Therefore, political thinkers who do not take the differences of the several layers, hanging them on the right seat, and examining them from time to time, their arguments will inevitably lead to thorough mistakes, and it is like using brocade to cover traps, and many people will fall into them."

How do we view England decades ago? The freedom that cannot be expected to be achieved suddenly is as clear as ten suns shining together, and the government cannot shirk its responsibility for careful nurturing. The question of similarities and differences between moving from tutelage to promulgation of a constitution is like a deep pit and a great valley that cannot be connected. If we rely on the old strategies of propaganda, and suddenly hope for the enlightenment of public opinion and the assistance of national affairs, it is no different from lying down and licking the sky. In the future, the constitutional crisis will not be just one or two. It is hoped that the wise men of the government and the public will carefully observe the difference between the group and the individual, and distinguish and practice with a public heart and sincerity, so that they can advance inch by inch and not retreat foot by foot.

### Yang Wendao's Ten Years in Prison: Appeals for Redress of Injustice; Sentenced to Death Under Enemy Authority

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, there is a patriotic prisoner who has been sentenced to death and has already spent ten years there. He is praying that in this time of renewed light, he can have his unjust sentence overturned and walk peacefully out of the iron gates of that gray building.

**Forced Confession, Unable to Express Grievances**

This case is the famous "Nakayama Hideo Case." The prisoner who has been imprisoned for ten years is named Yang Wendao, the eldest son of Yang Hanxiao from Zhongshan, Guangdong. This handsome 28-year-old youth came to our office hoping to appeal for justice for his father. He said that from the beginning, the entire Shanghai press corps, and even the judges involved in the trial, knew that the Japanese were plotting and scheming to create an incident, and therefore deliberately fabricated a major case. Japanese detectives tortured Yang Wendao in the police station for two months, forcing him to confess that he was instructed by our superiors to assassinate Nakayama Hideo. But Yang Wendao, deeply understanding the greater good, remained unyielding. When the trial came, the Japanese deployed armored vehicles and heavily armed soldiers at the entrance of the court, creating an extremely tense situation. Yang Wendao was eventually sentenced to death under the enemy's duress. While he was still appealing to the Supreme Court, the War of Resistance broke out, the government moved inland, and he was left in Shanghai Prison awaiting sentencing until now. It has been ten years since he was arrested.

**Appealing for Rescue in the Renewed Light**

After Yang Wendao was arrested, his family was in dire straits. His wife, Yang Tang, had to send her two youngest children to an orphanage, and another child wandered to the inland. Initially, relatives and friends provided some assistance, but when the war started, their residence on Tangshan Road was completely burned down. After the Japanese occupied Shanghai, even relatives and friends who were willing to help were afraid to provide assistance to avoid suspicion. For ten years, they endured the pain of family ruin and death. Now that the light has returned, they immediately began to rescue this old prisoner as soon as the government took over various Shanghai institutions in September. They submitted petitions to the Third War Area Command, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Relief Association for Comrades Who Suffered Hardship, the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai... Finally, on December 21, they mailed a petition to Nanjing, seeking help from Chairman Chiang. According to President Cha Liangjian of the District Court, he has already submitted a request for instructions to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. However, the family feels that the past ten years aside, the lack of news in recent months after the victory is making them somewhat anxious. They are making efforts in many ways, requesting people from all walks of life to uphold justice and overturn this unjust conviction.

### Three More Foreign War Criminals Captured

The Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters recently arrested three more foreign war criminals who aided the enemy: one is a Hungarian named Xiboke, who was a lackey of Colonel Nakamura, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Japanese Black Dragon Society. Xiboke set up a company to purchase military supplies for the enemy. The other two are Portuguese, one named Leimidis, born in Macau, with a Portuguese father and a Japanese mother. During the Japanese occupation, he changed to his mother's surname, calling himself Nakamura Leimidis, claiming to be Japanese and bullying Chinese people. Leimidis was also Xiboke's assistant, helping the Japanese military purchase supplies and making significant contributions. The other one, Xueerweiya, was also Xiboke's assistant. They relied on the power of the Japanese military to arbitrarily arrest people and imprison them in their private institutions, using torture. Many victims have reported them to the Garrison Headquarters. The Inspection Office arrested these three foreign rogues a few days ago, and it is reported that they will be sent to the court within days to be prosecuted for war crimes.

### Over 14,000 Cases of Registered Enemy Crimes; All Perpetrators Detained Awaiting Trial

The investigation of enemy crimes, which the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office was ordered to handle, started on November 6, 1945, and as of December 31, 1945, 14,528 cases have been registered. From January 1, 1946, to February 17, excluding holidays, over 27,600 registration numbers have been issued. The office originally planned to conclude this work in January, but is now forced to continue due to the situation.

**Japanese Military Police Who Committed Crimes Will Not Be Allowed to Return Home**

Furthermore, the personnel in charge of handling these cases found that among the cases occurring in the Shanghai urban area, the perpetrators were mostly Japanese military police. Therefore, they have consulted with the 23rd Regiment of the National Army Military Police in this city and agreed that the office will transfer the list of perpetrators to the regiment to cross-reference with the Japanese former Shanghai military police captured and managed by the regiment. Those identified will not be allowed to return home, for future trial needs. It is also learned that the Port Transportation Command of the Third War Area Command has also sent a letter to the office requesting the transfer of the list of perpetrators to detain them when sending Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents back to their country. It is reported that the office has registered a large number of victims from the countryside, and it is difficult to provide complete names for the Japanese robbers and murderers. The office has discussed with the Port Transportation Command to detain the Japanese senior military officers who allowed their subordinates to do evil in the last batch returning to their country for trial.

**High Court Prosecutor's Office Investigates Collaborationist Cases**

As of the end of 1945, the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office has received 77 cases of collaborators transferred to the office by military and police agencies in this city. Among them, some have already been prosecuted, and the rest are under investigation.

First class will be 50 yuan, third class 15 yuan, and trackless trams 30 yuan. Whether the price increase will be implemented from the 5th is uncertain. If the procedures are not prepared in time, it may be delayed for a few days. It is likely that the implementation date will be decided in three or four days.

### The Full Picture of Shanghai's Municipal Administration (Continued) The Bureau of Public Works Bears a Heavy Responsibility for Construction

—Our Newspaper's Interview Room—

As we are in the early days of victory, and municipal facilities face countless challenges and arduous work, in order to understand the progress of the city's administration in the past three months, this newspaper has interviewed the municipal government and its various bureaus and units to provide a systematic report. In addition to the general overview of the Municipal Government, Bureau of Finance, Bureau of Social Affairs, Bureau of Public Utilities, Bureau of Education, Bureau of Land Administration, Bureau of Health, Police Bureau, and Department of Civil Affairs, which have been published in the New Year's Day supplement, there is also a report from the Bureau of Public Works. Due to space constraints, it could not be published at the same time. We deeply apologize for this, and now specially publish it here for the readers' understanding.

Shanghai, after experiencing the ravages of war and the trampling of the enemy and puppets, has suffered enormous losses in the past eight years. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the most important task for the country is construction. And the Bureau of Public Works bears the heaviest responsibility for the construction of a great Shanghai.

Zhao Zukang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, is from Songjiang, Jiangsu Province. He is currently 46 years old and holds a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Civil Engineering from Tangshan Jiaotong University. Later, he was sent by the Ministry of Railways to study at Cornell University in the United States. After returning to China, he successively served as Director of the Wuzhou Bureau of Public Works, Deputy Director of the Highway Department of the National Economic Council, Acting Director, Director of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, Director of the Engineering Department of the Transportation Control Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, Deputy Director of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, member of the Phi Tau Phi Honorary Society, member of the International Road Association, and Vice President of the National Engineering Society. Recently, he was elected as the President of the Shanghai Branch of the Society.

The Bureau of Public Works took over the "Construction Bureau" of the puppet organization on September 12, 1945. After the takeover, the work was extremely intense, and the tasks were made even more difficult due to the destruction by the enemy and puppets. The total length of roads in Shanghai is 700,000 meters, and the road surface needing repair reaches 340,000 square meters. Currently, over 70,000 square meters have been repaired. There are 230 bridges in Shanghai, all of which need repair. All 500,000 meters of ditches in Shanghai need to be dredged, and only 45,000 meters, or one-tenth, have been repaired so far. If the material problem can be solved, the progress of the project can be accelerated in the future.

In addition, more than 80 wharves in Shanghai urgently need to be repaired, and 15,000 cubic feet of mud have accumulated in the ditches, which must be removed immediately. The bureau plans to carry out the work actively during the winter when the water is cold and the soil is solidified, so that the flood damage can be reduced during the rainy season.

The reporter asked Mr. Zhao whether the pre-war city center construction plan would be continued as before. Mr. Zhao replied that at present, the entire Shanghai is being targeted for construction, so it is much larger than the original city center construction plan. The reporter then asked how long the major construction would take. Mr. Zhao said that road maintenance engineering cannot be limited by time. If we are talking about repairs, after eight years of destruction, it is impossible to complete in a few months.

The current work to be done by the Bureau of Public Works is: (1) road maintenance, including the repair and renovation of bridges, wharves, flood control buildings, all public buildings, and parks; (2) dredging all rivers; (3) dredging of ditches and sewage pipes, and repair of rainwater pumping stations. Director Zhao expressed concern for the parks, saying that Shanghai has a large population, many factories, and the air is quite polluted. The citizens' mental and physical health are not comfortable, so he plans to focus more on parks to improve the health of the citizens. He also plans to build single-story affordable and ordinary housing near the city's factory areas to solve the city's housing problem.

As for the suburban highways, the highways leading to Longhua, Minhang, Caohejing, Hongqiao, and Wusong have already been repaired. The Pudong Avenue in Pudong has also started to be repaired. The highways in the city center were almost completely destroyed after the August 13th Incident, and are now being actively repaired.

The iron gates leading to Nanshi have been removed and will be completely dismantled by the end of 1945 to facilitate traffic. All road names are gradually being changed, and a complete list of new road names has been published. It is expected that the renaming will be implemented on New Year's Day, 1946. (End of full text)

### Trade Associations to Handle Industrial and Commercial Registration

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of industrial and commercial registration in this city, there is a deadline for obtaining and filling out forms. However, the level of knowledge in various industries is uneven, and they do not fully understand the filling procedures, causing them to travel back and forth, which is very inconvenient. In order to reduce the difficulties of the members, the dyeing and weaving industry, fresh meat industry, letterpress printing industry, and hot water store industry associations have successively submitted requests to the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting permission to purchase and collect forms from the bureau at a price, and handle all filling procedures on behalf of the members. It is reported that the bureau has approved the request, but it is still necessary to handle it in stages according to the areas specified by the bureau to maintain uniformity.

### Comparison of Gold and US Dollars

Some time ago, there were speculations about the new exchange rate in the newspapers, leading to a variety of reports. As a result, the speculative market, with its shallow understanding, was sometimes bullish and sometimes bearish, busy for a while, but in the end, the old price of over 800,000 yuan remained unchanged. Ordinary retail investors, worrying themselves needlessly, rushed around and bumped their noses, gradually becoming indifferent to the gold market. Recently, everyone has been concentrating on US dollars, with the general mentality of wanting to go from 600 yuan per 10 taels of US dollars to around 500. This is based on the US black market gold price returning to as low as $57 per ounce, which is consistent with the year-end gold market and the closing price of US dollars. It is found that the official US gold purchase price is $35 per ounce. During the war, the black market once soared to over $80. After the war ended, it hovered around $60 per ounce for a long time, which is equivalent to a little more than one tael in the market. Therefore, the accompanying city market is based on 600 per 10 taels. Since this city has abandoned gold in favor of dollars, in other words, the sentiment for US dollars is stronger than for gold. However, gold is constrained by the Chongqing listing price, and coupled with the popularity of stocks, the original 10 taels of gold could get 2,000 shares of Wing On or Mei Ah, which has recently shrunk to 930 shares of Wing On. The floating capital after profiting from stocks will inevitably come to replenish gold, and at that time, gold will definitely not be abandoned. It can be said that unless the US black market gold price drops again, or China re-establishes the gold price, it will be difficult for those who sell gold to buy dollars to achieve their expected goals, because $35 per ounce is the official purchase price set by the US Treasury Department, not the selling price. The country's price index is also much higher than when the gold price was set, and members of Congress have also advocated raising the gold price. In addition, China's gold listing price is based on the initial issuance price of 50,000 yuan per tael, plus a 40% contribution, and will not be changed in the short term. In this reporter's humble opinion, the authorities may not have an appropriate decision on the entire foreign exchange policy after the victory. Just look at the huge price differences between Chongqing, North China, and Shanghai, and the fact that Taiwan and the Eastern Nine Provinces each issued circulation vouchers, which is very obvious. Although gold is not as flexible as US dollars, it is often used as a bargaining chip for large transactions and will not be too far apart from US dollars. The speculative market in the future will inevitably form a long-term seesaw battle. (Qin)

### Lake Silk and Tung Oil Exported to the US Today from Shanghai

The US-China shipping route is very busy. Most of the imported goods are items from relief agencies, such as wheat, flour, cotton clothing, and old clothes and shoes. The most common commodities are canned foods such as foreign wine, milk, and White Pagoda, and the cotton textiles are also shipped for relief, including 200 boxes of flannel. There are no formal commodity imports. For the export of Lake silk and tung oil, there were two previous shipments to the United States. Today, the President Company's ship, Capaison Den, has another 300 pieces of Lake silk, 300 pieces of tung oil, fur, hog bristles, etc., totaling five to six hundred tons, departing for the United States.

### Economic Briefs

The Ministry of Social Affairs issued a telegram ordering that all properties of enemy and puppet organizations in recovered areas should be taken over by people's organizations approved by the Ministry, after being reported and transferred by the social administration authorities of each province and city.

Before the current laws are revised, all registration fees for companies will be charged at ten times the original amount.

Due to the slower business in December, the city's banquet tax will be collected at 45% of the November turnover. The total amount is over 38.81 million yuan, which will be distributed proportionally among 95 companies in the industry. In principle, 20% of the previous month's turnover will be collected sequentially for subsequent months, without any further discounts.

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai Yumin Woolen Mill has suspended operations due to the lack of raw materials. It is now actively preparing to resume operations. The factory previously produced Canqiu brand coarse wool and Double Hands brand fine wool.

Spring and Autumn

### Hope

— Lu Mang

"Hope" is like a bud, preparing to grow and blossom. The warm sunlight, the glistening morning dew, even the subtle mist and the gentle spring breeze are hope's dearest friends. Accompanying it, embracing it, hoping for its accomplishment.

The "imagination" of "hope" is the flower after the bud. We imagine the flower completed by the bud to be so beautiful and fragrant! Therefore, our "imagination" of hope is so perfect and wonderful!

But when hope is about to be realized, that is, when the imagination of hope is about to cease to be imagination, a sudden change occurs. Just as a bud is about to bloom, a sudden gust of wind and rain causes the bud to stiffen. How disappointing this is!

"Hope" is also like a "crescent moon." Children look forward to it making up for its imperfections, poets pray for it to increase in splendor, and lovers cherish it even more, preparing to spend the whole night on the lake or by the sea. However, on the day of reunion, dark clouds suddenly appear on the horizon!

This is more incomplete than before the imperfection was made up; the increased splendor turns to darkness!

"Hope" is also like a blade of grass, a blade of grass by the roadside, flourishing when suddenly a large leather shoe tramples it, withering in an instant. In reality, it has not even reached summer, let alone autumn.

But if we look a little bigger, a little further, if this bud falls, there will be another; if this month's bright moon does not see reunion, there will be another month. Even if this year's grass withers, there will be next year. Wildfires cannot burn them out; the spring breeze blows and they grow again. We all have a future.

Now is the time for us to generate hope again. Naturally, we are not discouraged. We still hope, still imagine, and our imagination of hope is not only still the outline of past imagination, but even more expanded and beautiful!

### Medicine for Rejuvenation

— Zhao Qingge

Every New Year, my heart is troubled! First: I don’t have much spare money to deal with this holiday, "trouble"; Second: I have been drifting outside for a long time, missing my relatives but unable to reunite, "trouble"; Third: The editors are forcing me to embellish the "New Year" manuscripts, but I have no literary inspiration, "trouble".

Especially this year! It is said that we have won; the national life should be a little better; but prices continue to soar; making you still under high pressure, enduring embarrassing difficulties. It is said that we have won; the common people should be able to triumphantly return to their hometowns; live and work in peace; but "transportation is difficult"; making you still "unable to return home"! It is said that we have won; finally, we have recovered a life from the gunfire, which should be worthy of celebration; worthy of comfort, something to tell; something to write; but there are too many problems in the national situation, making you still depressed, suffocated; you want to speak but have no voice; you want to cry but have no tears; you can't write anything; so you deeply feel that living is not as good as dying!

It is not that I want to be overly pessimistic. In fact, the country is seriously ill. As a citizen of the country, "pain and itching are related." I ask: who can bear it? Who can laugh?

People get sick because they have to work hard to make a living; over time, their bodies become unhealthy, and overwork leads to illness. Moreover, because they have no money for treatment, they become increasingly serious. If it is allowed to develop, there is only death! For the same reason, the country's illness is caused by political problems. The situation cannot be stabilized, and because there is no good way to guide it into submission, crises are everywhere. If it is allowed to develop, it is really unthinkable!

A person's unhealthy body is "illness"; a country's disorder is "illness"; a person without money is "poverty"; a country's mismatched politics is "poverty". Illness comes from poverty, and then illness after poverty; the poorer, the sicker; the sicker, the poorer! Just like: "National disorder" is due to "mismatched politics."

Illness is divided into yin and yang, "yin" lurking inside, "yang" forming outside. The progression of illness is mostly first yin and then yang; that is, it first spreads slowly inside, and then gradually develops outwards; this can also be called from light to heavy. The reason for this is, of course, partly due to the influence of poverty, and partly due to the psychology of patients who generally "hide their illness and avoid doctors". Patients are ashamed of "illness"; they never admit when they are sick; they never tell the doctor the truth about their condition; when the illness is terminal, although they instinctively fear death; it is too late to rescue! If they paid attention early; strengthened prevention; and stopped its development; then what is the point of illness? Moreover, "prevention" and "stopping" methods do not necessarily have to be medicine; "spiritual recuperation" is the best method of prevention and stopping the initial onset of illness. After the illness is serious, as long as the patient can "rein in at the edge of the cliff", he can still turn danger into safety! This requires the patient to eliminate the psychology of "hiding illness and avoiding doctors", and truthfully tell the doctor about the condition, so that the "right medicine can be prescribed". They should also absolutely follow the doctor's orders, so that the treatment of sores is effective and the resurrection is possible! Human illness is like this, and national illness is also like this.

If a country wants to be strong, it must have no disorder; and to quell disorder, politics must be in harmony. How to make politics in harmony? There must be good strategies. Political harmony is the country's capital; good strategies are the country's doctors.

China has been walking a path of bad luck, suffering from internal and surgical diseases for decades. Because of "illness" and "hiding illness and avoiding doctors", it has lingered to this day without recovery. Although the surgical symptoms are now cured, the medical symptoms are still spreading. It is like a person suffering from a high fever, and using a strong cold medicine will cause idiocy, so warm and cool medicine should be used. China wants to cure disorder, it must never use force, but should adopt a good strategy and achieve a peaceful solution! "Democracy" is enough to eliminate germs, and "peace" is enough to restore health! Democracy is like China's good doctor, and peace is like China's special medicine! "Good doctors" can make "special medicines"; special medicines can cure diseases.

People who are sick all hope that spring will turn better. Now I wish China a good turn in the spring of 1946! We now have excellent doctors. We only need to sincerely invite him to give us a "peace remedy." This "peace remedy" is the medicine for rejuvenation! It is guaranteed that the medicine will cure the disease, and China will be healthy from now on, and it will also be eternally strong from now on!

Peace is not only China's medicine for rejuvenation, but also the world's and all mankind's "medicine for rejuvenation"!

I am eagerly waiting for the New Year of 1947 here. I hope that I have already returned home by then; I hope that my father is sitting beside me. I happily and quietly write songs praising "New Year" again, and then, I will respectfully send it to the editor's door!

### Old Friend

— Lu Danlin

On a cold, desolate, and bleak road, someone suddenly rode past on a white horse. Because of the white color of the horse's coat, I couldn't help but recall the tragic incident in which my old friend Yang Xingzhi died in a car accident in Baima during his journey through Sichuan and Hubei.

Yang Xingzhi was a young man who was loyal to his duties, enthusiastic in his treatment of others, and had a promising future. Ten years ago, he worked at the Shen Bao. When the war of resistance against Japan broke out, he resolutely followed me.

I remember when I was the editor-in-chief of the Yijing Literature and History Biweekly, he wrote many rare and anecdotal accounts of the war from the army. In particular, Qiu Bai's final words, "Superfluous Words," were also sent to me by him for publication. Many publications had tried in various ways to find this manuscript without success, but he actually sent the entire manuscript and added a very detailed narrative before the text, giving readers a clear reference.

When the "August 13th" Shanghai battle broke out, he followed the army to Shishan to resist the war. In the midst of his busy military affairs, he took the time to visit me on Avenue Joffre. In war-torn Shanghai, being able to shake hands and talk with an old friend was a source of indescribable joy. I took him to visit the Tianchan Refugee Shelter, which I and several comrades had established. We talked freely about our lifelong ambitions, the future of the war of resistance, and the eventual defeat of the Japanese pirates, and our wills were exceptionally aligned.

On two occasions, he specially invited me to take a car to the front lines to actually observe the war. We ate bread and drank boiled water with the brave soldiers in the trenches. When enemy planes bombed the positions, we huddled at the bottom of the fortifications with the soldiers. The most dangerous time was at half past twelve in the middle of the night, when we drove to the front in a car that could not turn on its lights in that environment. Suddenly, there was a flash of light and a loud bang. An enemy shell broke a large tree, and the trunk fell directly on the hood of the car, causing the car to shake violently and stop. The driver and the guards got out of the car and used a lot of effort to move the branches away before they could start the car again. Less than two minutes later, enemy shells rained down on the road our car was traveling on in rapid succession. A stone stele in a graveyard by the road was broken by a stray shell and landed next to the car. The body of the car was damaged, and the right rear tire was punctured. The car was parked on the dark road, relying only on the sporadic light of a flashlight to change the tire. It took half an hour to repair it hastily.

When the fighting in Shanghai was intense, he often came to the special zone on official business and always made sure to stop by my residence for a chat. Battalion Commander Yao Ziqing and his entire battalion of soldiers died in Luodian, and they were from the same unit. He described the battle vividly.

Once, I saw him interrogating spies in a dilapidated temple in the front lines. He used many methods to question them, making it impossible for the spies to argue. Although they reluctantly said some vague words, it further proved the falsity of their strained and exhausted efforts, and they finally confessed their crimes. He said that he was originally a writer, usually engaged in literary pursuits. Now, participating in the great war of national resistance against foreign aggression, he had seen, heard, and experienced many things. In the future, compiling them into a book would also be very meaningful. Every time he saw me, he would say, "I've gained a lot of war material again." I strongly encouraged him to complete this masterpiece full of historical authenticity.

It is said that after he died in a car accident in 1940, his remains were hastily buried on a hill near Baima. The whereabouts of his widow and orphans are now unknown. His commander at the time told his subordinates that after the war ended, Xingzhi's remains would be moved and buried at Jieshan. Now, as the ten thousand trees wither and the north wind howls, I am filled with indescribable emotion as I remember my old friend in life and death. The Japanese invaders have been overthrown. I think Xingzhi's spirit in heaven should be able to rest in peace.

### Fog

— Li Fu

For the past few days, the misty fog has been really annoying. When there is no fog, the clear sky in the morning, the earth under the bright sun, and the setting sun on the willow branches in this corner of the small building are like a close-up shot, unfolding so poetically and spiritually in the east and west windows. Although I am not a poet or a painter, and I cannot think of a beautiful line of poetry or paint a picture in the scenery, I can indeed feel a comfortable intoxication and new satisfaction from the silent prospect. Rather than saying that this is a leisurely mood, it is more appropriate to say that the body and mind that are tired of life, especially for the leisurely and relaxed environment, need and feel the state of things deeply. Therefore, the feelings given to me by the thick fog these days are particularly turbid and dull, like suddenly covering a layer of white buffer in front of the eyes, a hazy expanse, unable to distinguish direction, height, width, even breathing also has an unnatural feeling, as if isolated from the world. So, I couldn't help but hate the fog, even curse the fog, because it couldn't let me express the accumulated emotions in my chest.

People always love to have a bright world that is sufficient for free galloping and activity. Although the fog does not hinder me or restrict my activities in personnel affairs, it does have an invisible and silent magic power, dimming my heart; dimming my eyes, making me feel like I am falling into a turbid sea with spraying water foam, that is, the biggest plane, ship, no matter how big its boldness, it cannot be used freely. Although there are still fixed routes in the sky and sea in the fog. Although the fog will not turn the universe into a black shadow, it has withdrawn a group of bottomless turbidity and haze from the universe.

I remember once at sea, when the wheel encountered a heavy fog, it was midnight, the sky was full of mist, and it covered the sea densely, the light mark of the lighthouse was covered, and the four were an endless darkness, the humid sea breeze was as cold as the Arctic Ocean, and it blew people to shiver, the sea waves hit the ship's hull and sent out angry Hanxi, the warning whistle of the far lighthouse, passed through the sea surface of the foggy night, stretched, from high to weak, like a beast, sadly and coldly dispersing on the foggy sea surface, The whistle on the wheel also whimpered and attached to it, followed by a tight bell ringing intermittently, a kind of terrifying and tense air, almost making people wonder if the ship had encountered danger. In this way, I spent the night in the terrifying alarm whistle and the chaotic bells, until the fog dissipated the next day, and then the atmosphere shrouded in Qi was lifted, and the wheel was able to identify the direction and move forward. The frightening image that "fog" gave me that time was too deep, but I can more thoroughly appreciate that only quiet and patient observation can overcome difficulties - fog.

### Surrender Song

— Jiang Suxuan

On September 2, 34th year, my General Xu Yongchang was ordered to stand guard at the allied state's American Missouri to receive Japan's surrender. On the 9th, Admiral He received the surrender in Nanjing.

Dark clouds and enemy flags fall, dragon battle whale slaughter shark cave apprentices, coral shattered 　 net collected, Chishui beads return like the joy of ignorance, warship teams thin Fu case, Mount Fuji covers its head and snow flows down, thousands of needles broken ten thousand bone ashes, one hundred and twenty generations of hegemony destroyed, small bullets strictly limit the old territories, so that fishermen are out of order and reasoning is unclear, surrender king avoids details and takes title of abundance, the middle court sends envoys to wield their festivals, before Xu went far to colonize the race, after Xu asked the sin of Zhongtian Xian, the divine land was bitterly trampled by iron cavalry, heavy completion understands the will of heaven, Surrender city is built with sixteen paths, six masters drive the wind and insert their wings, the stone city of Yu area has been desolate for a long time with smoke and water, the coiled dragon and tiger spirit is reborn, the lofty general points to the cast spear, the culprit willingly pays the punishment, the resentment and poison of hundreds of millions of people have not been fully repaid, generosity turns to teach righteousness, a true man Yue descends to relieve national difficulties, bell humble inscription Qing Shi books, forces water and fire to ascend the seat, take the opportunity to Kangji struggle for a moment, wait and see both inside and outside, Home Ren bumps into the destruction of the ambition, the rest of his life but pray to complete the drinking, a few boiling blood smell Chong call.

### Leaves

— Wan Qing

Although the weather is not cold, the season has arrived, and the roads are full of drifting fallen leaves. Poor children are picking them up carefully, one leaf and one collection, fearing that if they crowd each other, they will become the end, crushed into powder, and there will be no flames when they burn. In previous years, firewood was not considered anything, who would still bend down to pick up fallen leaves. This year, firewood is too expensive, so how can you not pick up fallen leaves! So, basket after basket, bag after bag, they drifted back with people. In poor families, the fire is lit in the stove, and blue smoke fills the room, but the rice is cooked, and both the cook and the diners are shedding tears. Although they are shedding tears under the mist, these tears are comforting, and they have never tried to plunder and steal, nor will they take by trickery and force. The old dog is great after all. It does not need people to jointly request, nor does it need to hold meetings to discuss, and it does not even put its name in the newspaper to show its solicitation. In spring, it puts on leaves for the trees, and in the hot summer season, it is used to shield from the scorching sun. In autumn and winter, people do not feel the threat of heat, so it floats down for people to pick up and burn!

Spring and Autumn in the Pen

### Trying the Pen

— Murong Sui

In the New Year's publications, there is much talk about "New Year's Pen Trials" and similar things, and I suddenly feel, with a kind of hypersensitivity, several inexplicable "sighs."

For the pen to be used only for trials is already sufficiently "humble and receptive!" At one time, everyone could just not try any more, and be straightforward, but those who were trying were still trying, and at another time, it became almost impossible even to try, everyone was "fully wary," yet those who wanted to try were still trying!

Of course! If it's okay to try and you still try, "success lies in trying since ancient times;" but if it's not okay to try and you still try, "there's never been success in reckless trials?" This is my first sigh!

Those who try the pen are merely trying a pen, what difficulty is there? "Small Beijing Village," "Seven Purple Three Sheep," "Three Purple Seven Sheep," everyone can try, even the sniveling kids just starting their education can try, and because "opening the pen in the New Year brings great luck in everything," I truly feel that trying the pen is an extremely sorrowful "game!" If instead of trying the pen you tried a knife, "I have a pen like a knife" or "I have a precious knife," "trying its edge," wouldn't that be refreshing! Or if I had guns, cannons, airplanes, even more so atomic bombs, wouldn't that be even more refreshing and exhilarating? This is my second sigh!

Fortunately, trying the pen is ultimately not a pen test; it's not necessarily for becoming a "Juren in the imperial examination," and certainly not for getting into the "eighth rank of Jinshi." Thinking about it this way, I'm still more "unfettered" than those who "try the knife," "try guns and cannons," or "try the atomic bomb." This is my third sigh!

I'm indulging in wishful thinking again: "Trying the pen" might as well be changed to "Playing with the pen," which would be much more "unfettered." We, the people who move the pen, always prefer "unfetteredness," and we can be "unfettered" by being "unfettered," I'm thinking! My fellow "pen-triers," won't you think it's "meritorious to move but useless to play," or what?

### Where Should Art Go? How Should It Go?

— Wen Zhaotong

The victory of the Anti-Japanese War is almost four months past, and everyone is busy with the work of repatriation. Our art department, it seems, is rarely mentioned. Because its contribution during the eight years was quite weak, it is no wonder that it is looked down upon today after the victory and has indeed fallen behind.

However, if art is to seek revival and development, what should be the current goal? And how can this goal be achieved? These are the problems we urgently need to solve.

To solve these problems, we should naturally first look at the current reality.

In the vast Chinese society, a common demand is for human freedom and happiness. If we in victorious China still retain the poisonous atmosphere of feudalism and still cause the masses to suffer, then this victory is in vain. Therefore, the direction that current art should take, in its active aspect, is to help the masses strive for freedom and happiness, and in its passive aspect, should be to eliminate feudalism and reduce all obstacles to the interests and future of mankind. In other words, our art should go from decadence to health, from sentimentality to joy, from deformity to rationality. It should not be "art for art's sake" in the aestheticist sense, nor "art for life's sake" in the narrow sense, but rather "art for the masses of humanity." To be clear: it is art that expresses the spirit of democracy.

We do not hope for a historical reproduction or reenactment of art; we absolutely despise individualism, geniusism, and heroism in art, as well as the emergence of so-called artists who serve the needs of a few. The art of Renaissance Italy or Germany is good, and the art of the Tang and Song dynasties in China is also acknowledged as good, but we absolutely do not recognize the reappearance of these things in the world or in China, because now it is the 20th century.

On the condition that we do not deny the historical value of these arts, we can only take the path of "sublation" now.

Western art, especially Western painting, has already become a tool of civilization like automobiles and airplanes and is shared by the world. Therefore, Chinese art should also take the path of the expressiveness of Western art, that is, adopt its materials and techniques.

Since current art belongs to the masses, all subjective forms of expression that are divorced from the masses should be abandoned. That is, we should not take the "xieyi" (sketching ideas) in Chinese traditional art and the strange forms of early 20th-century European art; we should use the form of "xieshi" (realism).

In Western realism, the realism of the Bariqye and Rococo eras is too crude and delicate, and the realism of naturalism is too weak. We might as well extract from the traditional spirit of French painting the realism of Ingres, Courbet, Cezanne, and even the modern Derain, but we should also extract the calligraphic spirit, the energy, the boneless style... these characteristics of Chinese national culture and infuse them into it. This is realism that contains elements of xieyi, an expression of the objective through the subjective, which is a new form of realism.

The content of art produced based on such forms of expression will certainly not be propaganda for the ruling class to suppress the ruled, nor a portrayal of the life of the bourgeoisie, nor entertainment or embellishments for a special class, the so-called "sycophantic" art. We demand works that reflect the theme of the brilliant democratic spirit. We hope for the rebirth of masters like Delacroix, Courbet, Millet, Paumier, and Zheng Xia, who painted "Refugee Pictures" later on, because their products once expressed a brilliant democratic spirit. Although the rebirth of masters is an impossible thing, we hope that the present or future artists, before conceiving your masterpieces, should learn from these historical masters in grasping the theme.

The art that is produced by expressing the theme of the democratic spirit through the new realistic form can be called "democratic new realism," which is what the masses are currently demanding.

### Our Newspaper Collects Relief Donations: We Want to Inspire Compassion and Maintain the Lives of Poor and Distressed Compatriots

Our newspaper yesterday received a letter from He Dequi and Liu Hongsheng, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Shanghai Winter Relief Committee, requesting that we promote widely and collect donations on their behalf, and publish them in a dedicated column every day to provide encouragement. From today, we will comply with these requests. We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will enthusiastically contribute and generously donate to jointly participate in this righteous cause. The association is the only relief organization in the city, with a sound structure and large scale. Its relief targets are refugees, disaster victims, widows, widowers, orphans, the disabled, and families of soldiers who fought in the war in the city, as well as families with three or more children who are extremely poor. The aforementioned people receiving relief are limited to those who cannot support themselves and have not received other relief. This scope is quite broad; all those who are utterly impoverished and helpless, as well as the poor who are hidden and have encountered misfortune, are included in the recipients of relief. The association will, in accordance with actual needs, carry out the following relief measures: (1) providing porridge or noodles (2) organizing sales at fair prices (3) distributing clothing and bedding (4) setting up shelters for the cold. These are all things that the poor urgently need, especially during the cold and freezing season! A few points in the association's constitution are also worth mentioning: (1) major merchants and industrial and commercial organizations that donate large quantities of rice, clothing, and bedding, or make large monetary donations, may be recommended for commendation or public recognition in accordance with the law. (2) The distribution of funds and goods should be preceded by a detailed investigation, and the amount of funds and goods that each person can receive should be announced before distribution, and the opinions of the donors should be accepted as much as possible. (3) If there are any false or inconsistent statements, or if the staff members engage in corruption, people are allowed to report them, and they will be investigated and dealt with immediately after verification. These three points alone show a glimpse of the sound organization of the association. It is hoped that enthusiastic and capable people will always think of the poor and give more help; the merit will be immeasurable!

### Qiu Wenxiang: Two People with the Same Name

— (Yong Yu)

Those Seeking Relatives and Friends Please Note

Recently, Yong Yu was entrusted by his teacher to place an advertisement in the newspaper to look for Mr. Qiu Wenxiang. Thanks to the careful notification from Huang Zhongnan and Wang Shukai of the 33rd Squadron of the 8th Air Force Brigade, it was learned that Mr. Qiu works at the 5th Route Command in Kunming, and he has already corresponded with Mr. Wenxiang and received a detailed reply, saying that there is a victory bonus that can be remitted. However, yesterday, a fast mail letter was suddenly received from "Qiu Wenxiang, No. 75 Guiyuan Temple, Baojie Yuan, Chongqing," asking to forward it to "Old Lady Qiu." Upon opening it, the language in the letter was different from the previous letter, and it said, "We have been separated for several years. I was very ill in Chongqing in June this year. Now I want to return to Shanghai, but I lack funds. Please wire 200,000 yuan quickly." This is very surprising. Who is this Qiu Wenxiang from Chongqing? Please pay attention, readers.
