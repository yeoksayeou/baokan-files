### Constitutional Draft Group of the Political Consultative Conference Confirmed: Provinces as the Highest Autonomous Units, the Conference Expected to Conclude Tomorrow

[Special Dispatch from our Chongqing Office, 25th] The various subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference continue to deliberate on the issues under their respective purview, making considerable progress. The Constitutional Draft and Policy Guidelines groups have entered their final stages, with the Constitutional Draft group achieving the most. In addition to the bicameral system for government organs, they have also confirmed that provinces will be the highest autonomous units, with provincial systems, provincial constitutions, popularly elected provincial governors, and balanced powers in their relationship with the central government. It is observed that the rigid and inflexible method of exercising five powers through five parallel and independent Yuan (branches) will be adjusted. The revision of the Five-Yuan system to make the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan government organs will significantly reduce future constitutional disputes and difficulties. Most of the Policy Guidelines have been agreed upon, and only further discussions are needed on the specific provisions of the government organization portion. The Military Group remains the most contentious, but an agreement may be reached within days. If progress continues smoothly, the conference will hold its closing ceremony on the 27th.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] The subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference have been meeting for several days. As of the 25th, the Government Organization Group has met six times, the Policy Guidelines Group seven times, the Military Group four times, the Constitutional Draft Group four times, the National Assembly Group twice, and the Comprehensive Committee once. It is learned that the Military and Constitutional Draft Groups completed their consultations today, reaching agreements on various issues. The Policy Guidelines Group is expected to conclude its work tomorrow, while other groups still need further consultations. The Comprehensive Committee was originally scheduled to hold its second meeting today, but it was not held due to time conflicts as many members were participating in the Military and Policy Guidelines Groups.

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] Amidst diminishing hopes for a smooth conclusion to the current Political Consultative Conference, the ten-member Comprehensive Group sought a compromise this morning on the conflicting reorganization plans of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The conference encountered a snag because the Kuomintang was unwilling to accept the Communist Party's demand to establish a joint military commission responsible for the reorganization work. Official sources said that the government reorganization has been stalled due to this difficulty. The Political Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to end on January 26, but there are now various signs that it may need to be extended to the end of the month.

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] Although the delegates have not expressed pessimism about the conference's future and generally hope for continued progress, based on tonight's situation, the Political Consultative Conference appears likely to conclude tomorrow without resolving various problems. Issues such as government organization, troop numbers, and the National Assembly remain unresolved, but each subcommittee has reported some progress. The outcome of Chairman Chiang's meeting with Zhou Enlai is approaching the agreement stage. Many believe this concerns constitutional issues.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 25th] Key representatives from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party held a meeting today at the Political Consultative Conference to address some of the difficulties surrounding major issues, while the conference's subcommittees continue to work. A government spokesman stated that although a general agreement has not been reached, it is inaccurate to say that negotiations have stalled. Neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party has adopted an obstinate attitude, and the overall situation remains fluid.

### Soviet Troops Have Withdrawn from Chifeng: Local Security Maintained by Local Militia, Executive Headquarters Guangzhou Group Arrives in Guangdong by Air

[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 24th] The Executive Headquarters' mediation efforts have made significant progress. The group sent to Luoshan, Northern Henan, has persuaded the government and Communist generals to agree to an immediate ceasefire. The group sent to Datong reported that there are no conflicts within a 70-mile radius of the city. Railway disputes near Xuzhou persist, but U.S. representative Hollist reported that the conflicts have decreased. Negotiations are underway in Jining. The group sent to Chifeng has made contact with both sides. Soviet troops withdrew from Chifeng on the 23rd, and the Executive Headquarters has requested the local security force to maintain security.

[United Press, Beiping, 24th] Tonight's communiqué from the Executive Headquarters indicates that when the Soviets withdrew from Chifeng (scheduled for yesterday), they handed over this important communication hub in Rehe to the Communist forces, not to the Nationalists. The communiqué stated: "The Soviet garrison in Chifeng withdrew yesterday as scheduled, and the supervisory team has requested the local security forces to maintain order." According to four American airmen who were detained by Soviet forces for seven days and released on Monday, there are no Nationalist troops in the Chifeng area, but there are some Communist troops. Recent news reports state that Nationalist troops in Rehe Province are at least twenty to thirty miles away from Chifeng. Therefore, most observers here believe that the "local security forces" mentioned in today's communiqué refer to the Communist forces.

[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 23rd] The harmonious atmosphere within the Mediation Department gives the impression that peace is within reach, but the atmosphere outside the Mediation Department is the opposite, suggesting that numerous shadows are still cast on the path to peace. The most pessimistic political figures pointed out to reporters that since the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist side, through the Mediation Executive Department, has learned about the National Army's troop deployment and has consistently concentrated more than three times the strength to attack the National Army's weak points. As a result, the National Army has lost sixteen cities. It is said that in the battle of Yingkou, the Communist army even deployed twenty-four tanks, while the National Army there had only one battalion, leading to the city's capture. Yongnian in Southern Hebei is still under siege, but fortunately, the city is surrounded by water on all sides and has not yet been captured. The cessation of artillery fire in Jining is mainly due to the National Army's withdrawal. Recently, the Communist army has been frequently mobilizing, concentrating on the railway lines and appearing to advance towards Beiping and Tianjin. All of this raises doubts about the future of the Political Consultative Conference and the effectiveness of the ceasefire order.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 25th] On the eleventh day after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party ordered a ceasefire, both sides continue to accuse each other of violating the order. The Communist army cited the Nationalist army's occupation of Shaduojiao near Hong Kong on the 15th of this month and the occupation of Mengcheng in Southern Shanxi on the 21st. The Communist army then recaptured two cities in Northern Shanxi that were lost after the ceasefire order took effect. The Nationalist army accused the Communist army of violating the order with the following facts: (1) The Communist army attacked Haizhou at the eastern end of the Longhai Railway; (2) The Communist army continued to attack Yanzhou in Shandong; (3) The Communist army cut off telegraphic communications in Xinyang. A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the Nationalist army intercepted an order from the Communist army authorities to their troops in Southern Henan, instructing them to plunder all food and conscript every able-bodied man.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th] The Guangzhou Investigation Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, consisting of six members, flew from Shanghai to Guangdong on the 25th, arriving at Tianhe Airport at 1:20 PM. The group includes U.S. military representative Colonel Miller, translator Feng Ruji, government representatives Major Huang Weiqin and Captain Ling Zhimin, and Communist Party representatives Major Fang Xu and Secretary Chen Hua. They are scheduled to visit Director Zhang Fakui on the morning of the 26th to begin their investigation.

### Ministries and Commissions Return to the Capital, Expected to be Completed by Early April

[Special Dispatch from our Chongqing Office, 25th] According to reliable sources, the return of the government's ministries and commissions to the capital is expected to be fully completed by the end of March or early April. The National Political Council may still hold one more session in Chongqing.

### Madame Chiang Returns to Beiping from Changchun: On the Way, She Visited Wounded Soldiers in Jinzhou

[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Madame Chiang flew back here from Changchun this evening. On her way, she made a three-hour stopover in Jinzhou, where she addressed Chinese officials and visited two army hospitals to comfort wounded Chinese soldiers.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 25th] Madame Chiang left here on the Meiling airplane at 8:00 AM this morning, accompanied by Chiang Ching-kuo and Dong Yanping. They will make a brief stopover in Jinzhou to offer condolences to the troops and meet with Director Xiong and Commander Du before transferring to Beiping and returning to Chongqing. Before leaving, Madame Chiang instructed reporters to convey her parting thoughts to the people of the Northeast and to inform the people in China proper that she had completed her mission of comforting the Soviet troops and the people of the Northeast. She felt very happy during this trip, but regretted not being able to visit other places due to time constraints. When Madame Chiang left here, senior Chinese and Soviet officials in Changchun and representatives from all sectors of society went to the airport to see her off.

[Special Dispatch from our Changchun Office, 24th] On the third day of Madame Chiang's visit to Changchun, she visited the Soviet Military Headquarters at 10:00 AM. During the 1 hour and 10-minute visit, she was able to see all departments of the headquarters and asked many questions to the soldiers. A private from Ukraine gave concise and respectful answers to Madame Chiang's inquiries. At the banquet at the headquarters, three to five attendants in white coats shuttled between the tables. At noon, she attended a civic meeting and gave a deeply moving speech, stating that she would provide effective relief to the suffering people of the Northeast and would launch a fundraising campaign immediately after returning to Chongqing. She expressed her regret that she could not visit other places to offer condolences during this trip and hoped that those present could convey this message to the people in remote areas. In the afternoon, she attended a meeting with representatives from all sectors of Changchun and told the women's representatives that she would convene a national conference of women's representatives and visit orphanages. In the evening, she will watch a drama performed by the Soviet army.

### Profound Friendship of the Soviet Military Authorities

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The Soviet military authorities hosted a banquet tonight to welcome Madame Chiang. The warm friendship shown by the senior Soviet generals towards President Chiang and his wife was the deepest this time, as revealed in the speech and toasts given by Lieutenant General Trotsenko, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army.

Trotsenko's Speech

Lieutenant General Trotsenko emphasized the traditional friendship between China and the Soviet Union and said that this friendship has become stronger because the two countries fought side by side against the common enemy and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. He believed that cultural and economic cooperation between the two countries is the foundation of lasting friendship. Madame Chiang's visit demonstrated the close friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Lieutenant General Trotsenko then wished the Republic of China boundless longevity and raised his glass to wish President Chiang a long life. He said, "We raise our glasses today to wish President Chiang good health. He is a great military leader and a great statesman. President Chiang has devoted his life to national affairs, always persisting and resisting Japanese aggression." Six other senior Soviet military officers also raised their glasses in succession to offer their congratulations, and their congratulatory remarks were as sincere as those of Lieutenant General Trotsenko.

Madame Chiang's Speech of Thanks

Madame Chiang immediately gave a speech of thanks, and cheers erupted. Madame Chiang first expressed her gratitude to the Soviet side for their hospitality and then said, "I now wish to call you friends of China and also friends of mine." She said in a conversation with Lieutenant General Trotsenko that the joy that this evening's grand occasion has given her is greater than any words can express. The Soviet government led by Chairman Stalin is a government of the people. Madame Chiang then raised the question of whether the Soviet people are friendly to China and answered it herself, saying that the Soviet Union provided assistance to China during the difficult period when China began armed resistance against Japan, not only helping us with aircraft but also helping us with flight personnel. The Soviet people are sincere friends of China, and I know this best because I was the Secretary-General of the Aviation Commission at that time. She continued to say that the Chinese people will never forget the Soviet Union's assistance to China. She mentioned the Soviet Union's recent assistance in recovering the northeastern provinces and said that the blood shed by Soviet soldiers in Northeast China has strengthened Sino-Soviet friendship. This friendship will last a long time because it is based on integrity and justice, and the cooperation between the two countries is also for the benefit of the people of both countries. China and the Soviet Union should maintain cultural and economic cooperation. Madame Chiang then raised her glass to wish Chairman Stalin good health, close cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, increasing happiness for Soviet women who have contributed to the war and peace, and expressed her respect for the bravery of the Soviet army.

Grand Reception Banquet

After the speeches, a color film of the recent Soviet anti-Japanese war was shown. This grand reception banquet held on the eve of Madame Chiang's departure then came to an end. Madame Chiang arrived three days ago and is scheduled to return to Chongqing on the morning of the 25th.

### University Students in Chongqing Petition the National Government, Urge the Success of the Political Consultative Conference, Express Protest to Britain and France

[Special Dispatch from our Chongqing Office, 25th] More than 6,000 students from eight schools, including National Central University, Chongqing University, the attached high school of Central University, Chongqing Mining High School, Shudu Middle School, National Art College, and Sichuan Educational College, petitioned the National Government to promote the success of the Political Consultative Conference and to express their protests to Britain and France regarding the construction of the Kowloon Pingshan Airport by Britain and the "Baeldin" French ship incident. They arrived at the square outside the National Government at 10:00 AM. First, the National Government sent someone to maintain order, and then members of the Political Consultative Conference, including Sun Ke, Zhou Enlai, Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, Shao Lizi, and Mo Dehui, spoke to the students in succession until 12:30 PM. After lunch, the entire group marched, distributing leaflets along the way, and the sound of slogans and singing resounded through the sky. Crowds gathered along the streets to watch the procession. The leaflets distributed jointly by the schools contained declarations to promote the success of the Political Consultative Conference, to declare the march, and to protest the Pingshan Airport and "Baeldin" incidents, addressed to the compatriots of the whole country. (A) Demands to the Political Consultative Conference: (1) National interests above all else, abandon factional selfishness. (2) Nationalization of the army. (3) Strictly enforce the ceasefire order to forever stop the civil war. (4) No political parties should interfere in schools. (B) Demands to the British Government: (1) According to the Atlantic Charter, Hong Kong and Kowloon should be returned. (2) Immediately stop the construction of Pingshan Airport.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 25th] About 2,000 Chinese students held a meeting and parade at the racecourse road stadium today to celebrate the ceasefire order in North China. The students protested the shooting of students in Kunming last month and demanded a reduction in tuition fees. U.S. troops in Tianjin were ordered to remain in their barracks to prevent accidents, and no accidents occurred as a result.

### Ministry of Communications Establishes District Telecommunications Bureaus

[Special Dispatch from our Kunming Office, 24th] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications had assigned telecommunications receiving commissioners to various restored areas. It is learned that their tasks have been largely completed. Recently, the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications has issued an order to commissioners in various places to complete their work by the end of the month and hand over their work to the newly established district telecommunications bureaus to unify authority. The Yunnan-Guizhou District Telecommunications Bureau will be formally established at the beginning of next month. The new director, Chen Shuren, is on his way to Kunming from Guiyang.

### Chairman Li Pinxian Will Focus on Provincial Affairs

### China's Air Force Training Work Will Be Completely Self-Responsible in the Future; General Chennault Will Leave Kunming for Shanghai at the End of the Month

[Special Dispatch from our Kunming Office, 24th] General Chennault, who came to Kunming to revisit old places, will leave Kunming for Shanghai at the end of the month. According to discussions, China's air force training institution can be established in Kunming, but because the terrain is too high, it is not suitable for novice pilots. Training novice pilots in places such as Beiping, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou is more suitable than in Kunming. It is heard that the government intends to move the aviation school back to Hangzhou because Hangzhou is the birthplace of China's air force training, and its climate and terrain are suitable for this work. However, Chennault believes that the area is close to the coast and is not suitable for establishing a training center because it is easily threatened from outside. During the war, China's air force training was initially undertaken by aviation schools in Kunming and Chengdu. After recruit training, primary and advanced flight training were mostly undertaken by aviation schools established by China in India. Graduates from training in India could be sent to the United States for advanced training. Recently, more than 100 trainees who had received training in India have been ordered to fly back to Hangzhou and other places from India. The aviation school originally established in Kunming was ordered to stop training work long ago. In the future, all levels of air force training will be fully responsible by China.

### Military Headquarters Dispatches Personnel to Take Over American Military Supplies in Various Places

Each group has dozens of experts and technicians who have been transferred from units such as the Ordnance Department, ordnance factories, the Health Department, the Telecommunications Specialist School, and Jiaotong University, totaling more than 120 people. Currently, because there are more American materials within Yunnan Province, the Special Commissioner's Office is located in Kunming. The office's work is expected to be completed within two months. American supplies taken over by the office will be distributed by the Ministry of Military Administration to relevant agencies and groups for storage and use.

### China National Aviation Corporation's Kunming-Shanghai Route Changes to Selling One-Way Tickets

### Rehabilitation Area Coal Mines: Stepping Up Plans for Reorganization

[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, 25th] After arriving in Nanjing, Vice President Weng is stepping up plans to reorganize the coal mines in the recovered areas and is urging the repair of the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Hankou railways. Weng is firmly convinced of the current need to revive the industry in the recovered areas. Regarding the two major difficulties in the resumption of work at Hengkeng, such as the shortage of raw materials and power, he believes that they are not impossible to solve. As long as the coal supply is smooth and transportation is restored, work can be resumed in stages. Weng's view on eliminating the current labor unrest is that workers' living standards need to be adjusted, but during a period of continuous production, strikes are a great harm to the workers themselves, because labor unrest may stimulate prices, and the wages they can win may be offset by rising prices.

### Zhang Guowei Discusses Finance in the North China Region

[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 24th] Zhang Guowei, Special Financial Commissioner for the North China Region, told reporters: (1) The soaring gold prices in Beiping and Tianjin have been greatly affected by the gold prices in the Northeast. It is rumored that the ratio of Manchurian currency to legal tender is thirteen to one. The gold price there is about 15,000 to 20,000 Manchurian currency per tael, which is about 200,000 legal tender, so gold flows to the Northeast in large quantities. The government is currently studying countermeasures. (2) If the conflicts are completely stopped and transportation is effectively restored, the prices of goods in North China will inevitably fall, because food and cotton from the countryside and goods from sea transport can come continuously. (3) Tax collection in North China has already started from Hebei and Shandong provinces. The current monthly income of several hundred million is used for government expenses, and the expenditures are about the same. If the conflicts stop and all tax collection is restored, and supplemented by the income from reorganizing the enemy and puppet properties, there will be no problem with the finances of North China. (4) The situation of redeeming puppet "joint notes" in Beiping and Tianjin is good. In the past two weeks, about 10 billion have been redeemed in Beiping alone. The amount of small denomination legal tender is not as lacking as people imagine, because this type of small denomination legal tender has been less circulated in the rear and is stored in large quantities in banks, so it can be transported in large quantities for redeeming puppet "joint notes." (5) The head office of the puppet Mengjiang Bank is in Zhangjiakou, and the situation is unknown. In the future, if the situation permits, it is planned to go there to investigate and handle the Mengjiang currency, but no method can be formulated at the moment.

### Miki's Covert Activities; Arrested in Jinzhou

### Troop Reduction in the Xuzhou Pacification Zone: Headquarters of Field Armies and Army Groups Abolished; Tang Enbo, Feng Zhi'an, and Others Appointed as Military Region Commanders

[This Newspaper's Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] The reorganization of the troops under the command of the Xuzhou Pacification Zone has been largely completed. The headquarters of the field armies and army groups, originally under the Theater Commander's Office, will be abolished by the end of this year. However, to facilitate command, troop reorganization, personnel reduction, and local pacification, the directly subordinate forces of the Xuzhou Zone will be reduced to four pacification armies, with Tang Enbo, Wang Yaowu, Feng Zhi'an, and Liu Ruming serving as military region commanders. It is reported that the troop reduction in the Xuzhou Zone has resulted in the actual disbandment of five divisions. Furthermore, the Military Affairs Commission, noting that Feng Zhi'an had obeyed orders after the cessation of conflict, maintained calmness in difficult circumstances, defended the locality, and completed the protection of the Jiawang coal mine, which is vital to the nation's lifeline, has requested the National Government to issue a commendation order. The Military Affairs Commission has also rewarded the officers and soldiers of Feng's unit who were injured while protecting the mine.

### Harriman Leaves the Soviet Union; To Meet Marshall in Chongqing

[United Press Moscow Dispatch, 24th] The U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, left here by plane today to return to the United States. Before his departure, Harriman stated that he intends to stay briefly in Chongqing to meet with General Marshall, President Truman's special envoy to China, and then proceed to Korea before going to Tokyo to meet with General MacArthur. It is understood that Harriman held a meeting with Marshal Stalin on Wednesday night. It is widely believed that his stops in various places on his way back to the United States may be related to the differing views between the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding developments in the Far East. Qualified diplomatic sources here believe that Harriman may not return to Moscow, as he has already settled his personal affairs before his departure. Some speculate that he will assume a position in the Far East or resume managing his industrial and financial interests in the United States. It is widely believed that in recent months, he has played a significant role in planning the Allied Far East policy, so that he can report the Soviet viewpoint to U.S. policy designers upon his return.

### Four Hundred Tons of Sichuan Grain Arrive in Hankou; Hubei Provincial Government Distributing Emergency Agricultural Loans; Relief Administration Distributes Flour and Clothing

[This Newspaper's Hankou Dispatch, 24th] With the Lunar New Year approaching, there is still little coldness in Wuhan.

[Report from This Newspaper] A London broadcast on the 26th reported that the United Nations Security Council decided yesterday afternoon to include the issues of Iran, Indonesia, and Greece on the agenda for Monday's meeting. A fierce debate reportedly occurred between Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the time. First, Bevin rose and delivered an impassioned speech, stating that any country, large or small, should have the right to file complaints. He had grown tired of hearing repeated accusations in closed meetings that the Soviet Union was threatening world peace, and therefore brought it up in a public meeting today. Bevin also said that the Security Council should allow the Iranian representative to present his case, but with regard to the Indonesian issue, Bevin suggested that it should be handled by the Dutch East Indies themselves. After hearing Bevin's remarks, Soviet representative Vyshinsky immediately rose and stated that although the General Assembly had included the Iranian issue on the agenda, the Soviet Union would not abandon its consistent position, meaning that the Soviet Union believes that the Iranian dispute is not a matter that the Security Council has the power to intervene in.

[Report from This Newspaper] A London broadcast on the 25th reported that Vyshinsky, the Soviet Union's chief representative at the United Nations General Assembly and Deputy Foreign Minister, sent a letter to the Security Council today expressing regret over Iran's complaint. Vyshinsky also stated that he was concerned about the Council's consideration of this complaint. He claimed that Azerbaijan's demand for autonomy was solely a matter between that country and Iran, and should be resolved through direct negotiations between the two countries.

[United Press London, 24th] Hours after the United Nations General Assembly unanimously decided to establish an atomic energy commission under the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes abruptly boarded President Truman's special plane to return to Washington. Before his departure, Byrnes said that the United States supported the Security Council immediately and publicly discussing the issues of Iran, Greece, and the East Indies.

[United Press Washington, 25th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Hossein, broadcast today that the Iranian government has no intention of withdrawing its complaint against the Soviet Union to the Security Council. If the Security Council takes no action on this matter, then the Council will not survive and will already be dead. If the Security Council tolerates violence or aggression, it will sow the seeds of a third world war.

### Military Staff Committee to Convene Before February 1st

[Report from This Newspaper] According to a London broadcast on the 25th, the U.S. chief representative proposed at the Security Council's public meeting today that a United Nations Military Staff Committee be convened before February 1st, which was passed, thereby laying the foundation for the military power of the world organization.

[Reuters London, 25th] At today's public meeting of the United Nations Security Council, one item on the agenda was to provide the Security Council with military force to enforce peace. The step to take was to establish a Military Staff Committee to implement one of the clauses stipulated in the United Nations Charter, namely that the Security Council should decide on measures as soon as possible to establish a special force of the United Nations to guarantee peace.

[United Press London, 25th] The United Nations Security Council will take its first step today towards a plan to allow the Council to deploy "teeth," meaning troops, from member states to maintain world peace. The eleven members of the Security Council must also decide how and when to review the disputes in Iran, Greece, and the Dutch East Indies presented by Britain and the Soviet Union. The meeting of the Council scheduled for this afternoon is expected to adopt the previously proposed directive to immediately establish a Military Staff Committee composed of the "Big Five" chiefs of staff or their representatives. The drafting of "special agreements" regarding the quantity, quality, and ease with which the Security Council can deploy international forces will be undertaken by these military leaders. However, the main task of the Council will be to decide how to deal with the "current situation" disputes in places like Iran. To prevent unexpected changes, the Security Council is expected to hear a preliminary report next week before attempting to adjudicate the value of these issues and whether it will take any action. British officials have repeatedly stated that Foreign Secretary Bevin is extremely eager to have "the earliest opportunity" to "explain and defend" Britain's policies towards Greece and the East Indies. There are signs that a fourth political dispute may be raised in the Security Council. According to news from Lebanon, the government is instructing its representative attending the United Nations General Assembly to bring the issue of Allied troops still stationed in Lebanon to the Security Council. At the same time, on the international stage, the Greek issue may become more complex due to the signing of a financial and economic agreement between Britain and Greece (with the participation of the United States). Some observers believe that this will give those who criticize Britain's policy towards Greece more opportunities to criticize. They may use this to accuse Britain of attempting to control the Greek economy, because the British-Greek economic agreement is closely linked to the subsequent elections in Greece.

### Regarding the Korean Issue: The Course of the Three-Power Conference

[United Press London, 25th] Moscow broadcast today that some newspapers in the U.S. military occupation zone of Korea had published news implying that the Soviet Union wanted to establish a trusteeship system in Korea. This report is completely inaccurate. The authorities have authorized TASS to deny it and publish the facts. It is claimed that the United States proposed at the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference that Korea could be jointly administered by China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the transitional period, but later withdrew this proposal and supported the Soviet proposal. The Soviet Union advocated the immediate establishment of a provisional democratic government in Korea, jointly supervised by China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but limited to five years. According to the U.S. plan, Korea would be jointly administered by the four countries for ten years.

### Soviet Union Decides to Participate in the Trial of Japanese War Criminals

[United Press Tokyo, 25th] It was learned today from authoritative sources that the Soviet Union will send a representative to participate in the international tribunal to try Hideki Tojo and other war suspects. The Soviet Union will send a prosecutor to assist Chief Prosecutor Keenan, but the list has not yet been released. The trial is expected to be held in the former Japanese Ministry of the Army before the end of February.

[United Press Washington, 25th] British judges Carl Heathley and Davis, along with 36 others, came here yesterday and, after a meeting with U.S. officials, departed for Tokyo this evening to participate in the trial of Japanese war criminals.

### U.S. Mechanics Repair the Engine of a Constellation Transport Plane

The plane has an engine cowling, somewhat similar to the hood of a car, that can be opened at any time, allowing mechanics direct access to inspect the engine. Metal bulkheads separate the four 2,500 horsepower engines, which can be opened and closed in two minutes, which is a significant improvement over previous models.

### Earth and Moon Have Made Contact: Using Radar as the Medium

[United Press Washington, 24th] The Department of the Army announced today that scientists from the Army Signal Corps have successfully made contact with the moon using radar in an experiment. This event will be of great value in both peacetime and wartime applications. The experiment was conducted at the Evans Signal Laboratory in Belmar, New Jersey. The first contact with the moon was made on the 10th of this month, and there have been several successes since then. During the experiment, special equipment was used to transmit extremely high frequency energy waves into space at the speed of light, and the echo was detected approximately half a second later. The moon is approximately 238,857 miles from Earth. One application of this experiment may be to use radar to control the launch of long-range jet-propelled rockets orbiting the Earth in the stratosphere.

[United Press Los Angeles, USA, 25th] After the U.S. Department of the Army announced that it had made contact with the moon using radar waves, Australian retired officer Major Osborne said today that the Australian scientific community had made contact with the moon using radar as early as 1941. Australian scientists at the radar physics laboratory at the University of Sydney used high-powered radar equipment to transmit waves to the moon and immediately detected its fluctuations, which occurred intermittently every 2.4 seconds.

[Reuters London, 25th] The Royal Navy icebreaker HMS Protector yesterday conducted a secret test of ultra-shortwave instruments while navigating blindly in the Thames Estuary. Despite the congestion of ships in the estuary, no collisions occurred. It is expected that all British merchant ships will be equipped with radar equipment within one or two years, allowing them to navigate in any weather conditions. During the test, the captain, inside a closed wheelhouse, used the indications on the radar screen and a microphone to issue commands to the helmsman 30 feet away. The screen showed bridges within two miles and ships moving and docked in the river. Based on these instructions, the helmsman steered the ship, and as a result, nothing went wrong. Only a few hours after this test, news came that a British merchant ship and an American oil tanker had collided near Goodwin Sands in the English Channel due to poor visibility, both suffering severe damage.

### Sir Kerr Appointed British Ambassador to the U.S.; Kerr, in the Capacity of Special Envoy, Travels to Java via Cairo

[Reuters Washington, 25th] Authoritative sources here report that the White House has agreed to the British government's appointment of Sir Kerr as Ambassador to the United States, replacing Lord Halifax. Kerr, formerly Ambassador to the Soviet Union, is now traveling to Java in the capacity of special envoy to investigate the Indonesian issue.

[United Press Moscow, 25th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kerr, said today that he is scheduled to fly to Cairo tomorrow to meet with Dutch Deputy Governor-General Van Mook, and will then travel from Cairo to Japan to participate in negotiations on the East Indies independence issue.

### French Three Parties Announce Political Truce; Coalition Government to Be Formed

[Report from This Newspaper] A London broadcast on the 25th reported that the new French cabinet is expected to be formed tomorrow. New President Gouin met with leaders of various parties today, including Communist Party leader Thorez and Progressive Christian Democratic Party leader Mendès France, totaling ten people.

[United Press Paris, 24th] The three major parties in France, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the People's Republican Movement, formally announced a political truce today in order to jointly participate in President Gouin's new government. The three parties have reportedly reached an agreement on the candidates for the new government and its platform. The position of Foreign Minister will belong to the People's Republican Movement, the position of Minister of Economy will belong to the Socialist Party, and the positions of Minister of the Army and Minister of Social Welfare will belong to the Communist Party.

### Japanese Bureaucratic Political Tradition Broken; Ministry of Home Affairs Completely Reorganized; Nearly Half of Local Governors Replaced

[Central News Agency Tokyo Special Dispatch, 25th] After the Japanese government passed the cabinet's resolution on reorganizing the Ministry of Home Affairs, it dismissed 28 of the 47 local governors and appointed 28 new local governors. Previously, Japanese local governors were all officials who, under the leadership of Koichi Kido, formed a bureaucratic political group. This major reorganization has broken the tradition of the bureaucratic group suppressing the Japanese people.

[Central News Agency Tokyo Special Dispatch, 25th] Major reorganization of Japanese general prefectural governments took place today. According to exclusive news from the Jiji Press, Minister of Home Affairs Mitsuyama Tadao retained and selected prefectural government personnel for 28 prefectures to replace those affected by MacArthur's fourth purge order. The new prefectural government personnel will pay their respects to the Japanese Emperor this afternoon and will be announced immediately. If this reorganization can be realized, it will be one of the most important reorganizations of the Japanese government in recent years. The position of Japanese prefectural governor is comparable to that of the provincial chairman in China. The number of 28 prefectural governors removed this time exceeds half of all 47 prefectural governors in Japan.

### MacArthur Respects Women's Rights; Liberates Japanese Prostitutes

[United Press Tokyo, 24th] The Japanese have a centuries-old custom of selling their daughters into brothels. Today, this has been prohibited by MacArthur's order. MacArthur ordered the Japanese government to abide by the Potsdam Declaration's guarantee of "respect for fundamental human rights," and therefore it must abolish all laws relating to public prostitution and all indentures that bind women. Brothel licenses have recently been banned, but the laws permitting the sale of daughters still exist. Two weeks ago, the Tokyo Brothel Operators Association resolved to liberate prostitutes, abolish indentures, and allow them to operate independently.

### Japanese Bear the Cost of Occupation Forces; Now Exceeds 700 Million Yen

[Central News Agency Tokyo Special Dispatch, 25th] The Ministry of Finance announced that the Allied occupation of Japan, up to the end of last year, had cost defeated Japan 700,119,200 yen.

### Brothers in Difficulty: One Wants to Go to Heaven, One Wants to Go to the Sea

[United Press, New York, 24th] Dr. Jean Piccard, Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, plans to ascend 20 miles into the stratosphere in a balloon, five miles higher than any human has ever been. His brother, Auguste Piccard, is currently conducting research in his hometown in Switzerland, planning to descend 13,000 feet into the ocean depths. The two are twin brothers who were both previously known for their balloon ascent research. Now, they reside in opposite hemispheres, one thinking of ascending to the heavens and the other planning to enter the sea, truly brothers in difficulty. Auguste's diving apparatus, modeled at the University of Brussels, is a sealed small chamber, weighing ten tons, constructed with copper plates. Its window glass is 18.4 inches thick to withstand the immense pressure at the bottom of the sea. Jean Piccard plans to ascend with his wife in a balloon, using a balloon never before used in stratosphere exploration, hoping to expand human knowledge of the upper layers of the atmosphere, paying particular attention to cosmic rays. This research will contribute to the development of atomic knowledge.

### At the Trusteeship Council Meeting: Gu Weijun's Speech – The Ultimate Goal of the Trusteeship System: To Enable the Governed to Become Independent and Autonomous

[Reuters, London, 25th] Self-governance for all peoples of the world is one of the conditions for lasting peace. This point was raised by the US representative Dulles and the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Gu Weijun, at the Trusteeship Committee meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in Westminster Central Hall last night. Dulles proposed an amendment, seconded by Gu Weijun, advocating for the establishment of the Trusteeship Council in the latter half of the General Assembly's meeting in the United States. At that time, consultations can be held with the mandated powers to place the mandated territories under trusteeship. The committee will continue its meeting today, and will continue to discuss the American amendment, with representatives from the Netherlands and Iraq speaking.

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] The Chinese representative Gu Weijun stated in his address to the Trusteeship Committee: the trusteeship system will bring hope to millions of non-self-governing peoples. He expressed his pleasure at the statements of several United Nations member states, especially the decision of the United Kingdom and New Zealand to place their mandated territories under the trusteeship system. He said that this statement was extremely touching and demonstrated each nation earnestly hoped to establish the Trusteeship Council as soon as possible. However, statements made by other countries on this same issue have aroused our suspicion and unease. Gu continued, after the First World War, General Smuts suggested the idea of mandated territories instead of territorial annexation. This view was highly praised, and today this view has become more complete within the United Nations Charter's trusteeship system. Ownership of dependent territories should belong to the governed people. In mandated territories, the administrative authorities act on behalf of the League of Nations. One day, the people of the dependent territories will mature, and they will no longer be regarded as inferior but as equals in the international community. Millions of people will see the United Nations Organization as a "reliable protector of their welfare." The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that the independence of the people of dependent territories should be the ultimate goal of the trusteeship system. The rules of the trusteeship system should be as clear, broad, and generous as possible. Chapter XI of the Charter stipulates the obligations and responsibilities of the administering powers, which is "a cornerstone of the new peace tower" representing a "far-sighted and statesmanlike policy." China attaches great importance to this charter. The obligations contained in the Charter are a major step forward, and on the basis of these obligations, countries should govern mandated territories, not placing their own interests above the interests of the governed people, as their sacred duty. In the hearts of the Chinese people, Chapter XI of the Charter is a torch illuminating the path to self-governance for millions of non-self-governing peoples. When the governed people reach maturity and can govern themselves, and join the international community, one cause of unrest and anxiety in the world will be eliminated, and the world will enter a smooth path of tranquility and harmony.

### UNRRA's Forty-Eight Nations to Meet in Shanghai Early Next Year; Two General Assemblies to Be Held in the US and Europe This Year; UNRRA Purchases Barges to Transport Supplies to China's Inland Rivers

[United Press, Washington, 24th] The highest administrative officials of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) announced today that the forty-eight nations participating in UNRRA will meet in Shanghai early next year. UNRRA is currently guiding the preparations for this major conference, but there will also be two general assemblies held this year. The Shanghai meeting will be the closing meeting of UNRRA. The first of the two international conferences this year will be held in a few weeks, roughly in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the United States. The second is expected to be held in Europe in the autumn. According to reliable sources, UNRRA plans to close down after one year. The Chinese side hopes that UNRRA's highest guiding authorities will come to the Far East before the closure. UNRRA administrative officials have indicated that it is unlikely that China and the Philippines will be able to obtain expanded relief above their allocated amounts, as UNRRA has no extra funds and cannot reduce relief efforts elsewhere. The relief that China has obtained has been the highest since the establishment of UNRRA's budget, totaling $675 million. The Philippines received a total of $3 million. The supplies already allocated to China should prove to be the highest amount that China can absorb within a year.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] In order to advance the Far East relief plan, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has decided to send a special delegation to the Philippines and China within days to purchase 100,000 tons of barges in order to transport relief supplies to China's inland rivers. The delegation consists of three people, led by Swanson, who will first go to Manila to obtain surplus naval and marine vessels there. The agency will purchase various types of boats with millions of dollars and ship them to China as soon as they are acquired.

### The Old US-Thailand Treaty Remains Valid

[US News Service, Washington, 24th] US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson issued the following statement: After the United States and Thailand resumed normal diplomatic relations, the United States has repeatedly held talks with the Thai government. Both countries acknowledge that the treaties and other international agreements signed between the United States and Thailand before the outbreak of the war in the Far East remain in effect. The treaties and agreements involved in the talks include the Treaty of Friendship, the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of January 13, 1937, and the Final Protocol, the Memoranda exchanged between the two parties, the Extradition Treaty of December 30, 1922, and the Agreement to Abolish Passport Inspection Fees of 1925.

### The Commander of the US Army Air Forces is Succeeded by Spaatz

[United Press, Washington, 24th] President Truman announced today that General Arnold's resignation as Commander of the Army Air Forces has been approved, and his vacancy has been filled by Spaatz. General Spaatz has served with distinction in the European and North African theaters and was later the commander of the strategic bomber force in the Pacific theater. The B-29 aircraft that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima was under his command.

### China Purchases Ten Ships from the US

[United Press, San Francisco, 24th] Local newspapers reported today that China has purchased ten Z-B type ships from the United States for use in its shipping industry, at a price of $4.32 million.

### Local Dispatches

Kunshan

Planning to Repair the Kunshan-Taicang Highway: The local authorities of this county, considering that the Kunshan-Taicang Highway has been in disrepair for many years and has greatly affected transportation, have formulated a repair plan. Within a short period, they will conscript laborers and rush to complete the repairs. The required funds of over 500,000 yuan have been submitted to the provincial government for approval.

Changshu

Setting up a Petition Box in the Pacification Sub-division: The Third Sub-division of the Pacification Work Supervisory Group, in order to diligently seek the opinions of the people, has specially set up a petition box to receive confidential reports from all sectors of the public. Anyone who has suffered illegal harassment or injury from local bullies, ruffians, traitors, bandits, local officials, military police teams, or former underground work officials or soldiers during the period of enemy occupation is eligible to submit a petition. Once accepted, it will be handled impartially, without any favoritism.

Suzhou

Coal Mine Case: The High Court Orders Seizure of Evidence: The manager of the Baoshan Coal Mine Company, Li Pengfei, was reported for suspected collaboration with the enemy. The High Procuratorate has already detained Li Pengfei and Deputy Manager Mei Damo. In a bedroom of Xu Boming's daughter in Wanshi Lane, a Japanese man named Yamaga Tsuneharu (alias Yang Tiansheng) was arrested. He, along with Xu Boming and his daughter, were taken to the court for interrogation. Later, Mei Dahan and Xu Xin were released on bail due to insufficient evidence. The remaining individuals were detained pending trial. Yesterday, the court interrogated Yamaga, but since several antiques looted by the Japanese man in Suzhou had not yet been recovered, the court immediately dispatched bailiffs, accompanied by the suspect, to Xu Boming's house and Li Pengfei's house to seize several antiques for the record. After returning to the court, the suspect was returned to custody.

Wuxi

Request to Rush the Repair of the Shanghai-Yuyao Highway: The county government held its third restoration meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM, chaired by County Magistrate Fan Tisheng. The following important items were resolved: (1) Simplifying military grain procedures; (2) Due to financial difficulties in the county's administrative expenses, temporarily borrowing 300 yuan per mu of land from each owner, to be implemented after provincial approval; (3) Requesting the Third War Area to allocate firearms for local self-defense; (4) Hiring design committee members to plan the construction of a new urban area; (5) Requesting the Construction Department to rush the repair of the Shanghai-Wuxi and Wuxi-Lushan highways to facilitate transportation; (6) Readjusting the names of the district offices and submitting them to the provincial government for approval.

Pinghu

Pirates Discovered on the Zhapu Sea: Yesterday, more than 300 pirates were suddenly discovered on the Zhapu Sea. They were constantly moving back and forth within hours. From the appearance of the river in Zhapu, between Jinshan and Haiyan, they seemed to be trying to land along the coast. The matter has been closely watched by the local garrison. The National Army and the Self-Defense Brigade are strictly preventing their actions and have begun a full town curfew, day and night, from last night to prevent accidents.

Jiaxing

A Murder Case Occurred in Fengjie Bridge Town: In the Shengjiabang area of Fengjie Bridge Town, Jiaxing, there was a Sheng widow, in her thirties. Because her husband died early, she could not bear to sleep alone. Several years ago, she became acquainted with a butcher named Huang Laifu and had a child with him, who is now four years old. Because Huang was addicted to alcohol, he often argued with the Sheng woman after getting drunk. The other day, due to drunkenness, the two had a dispute. The woman threw a hoe at Huang, hitting him in the head. Huang immediately fell to the ground, his brains splattered, and he died on the spot. Seeing that she had caused trouble, the woman tried to cover up the crime. However, the child revealed the truth, and the chief reported it to the town police station, who arrested the woman and handed her over to the local court for investigation.

### A Glimpse of the General Life in America, Britain, and France Through the Eyes of Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in the United States: Overseas Compatriots Appear in "China World," Sent by Zhu Jiarang from New York

Speaking of our Chinese compatriots in America, there are too many. "Chinatown" is originally a Chinese world, with Chinese characters, Chinese language, and Chinese newspapers being very common. It is said that in "Chinatown" in San Francisco, one can send letters in Chinese and make phone calls in Chinese, but this is mostly limited to the scope of the Cantonese old overseas Chinese. As for our dignitaries, wealthy gentlemen, celebrities, and scholars, I will now call them "high-class Chinese." One can run into them on the street at any time, especially during Christmas or New Year, when many come to New York to play. On the streets and in restaurants, men and women mingle and laugh. Listening to their accents, they are all "our precious compatriots," but they do not greet each other face to face and there is no feeling of "meeting an old friend in a foreign land." This is different from Paris and London, probably because there are too many people here, so it is not considered rare.

### Overseas Leisure, Ashamed of the Title of Doctor

According to what I have gathered in the past few days, the "high-class Chinese" here generally live well. Many bring their wives and children, live in comfortable apartments, and lead a leisurely life. Of course, they must have some connections to be able to come here and enjoy themselves. But strangely, many people's hearts still seem to be full of resentment, full of complaints, either scolding the central government for being incompetent or complaining about being unappreciated. Some have the title of doctor and treat the people in their country as fools, arrogant and snobbish, and are still bringing shame abroad!

### People Hope for Stability, the China Daily is the Most Popular

The news of the motherland seems to be more accessible here than in Britain and France.

First, there are many American reporters in China, and Chinese telegrams are more abundant.

Secondly, there are also four Chinese newspapers. Although they cannot obtain proper domestic news telegrams, they still have some news to read through Associated Press. Among them, the China Daily is the most complete, but its sales are not as good as the China Daily. It is said that the China Daily can cater to the "hearts" of most people who "hope for stability."

### American Production Has Not Yet Reached Normal Levels

The prices here have also risen a lot compared to before the war. Fortunately, everything except sugar can be bought freely. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) has restrictions on various prices, but the black market is still unavoidable. If you have money, there is always a way. Under the current living conditions, a few hundred dollars can rent a public apartment with five or six rooms. If you eat out every day, a single person's food expenses will cost seventy or eighty dollars a month. Some daily necessities are cheap, and some are unexpectedly expensive. After all, peacetime production has not fully recovered. The watches and fountain pens that domestic friends welcome the most are still scarce. The watches are all new brands, and luxury tax is charged when buying them. I have never seen a Parker 51.

I have a few more observations, which I will record below:

### Although France is Weak, Its Advantages Cannot Be Erased

Among the three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, the United States is naturally the richest and strongest, and France is currently the weakest. However, the French nation can never have its advantages erased because of its defeat. On the contrary, the French people's achievements in art and science, as well as their high level of culture from the perspective of their way of life, are by no means inferior to those of Britain and the United States. The city administration of Paris is very much up to modern standards, with all the facilities it should have. Before the war, France and Switzerland were famous for attracting European and American tourists to earn money. Unfortunately, after the war, they suffered great losses and deep pain, resulting in insufficient food and clothing, high living costs, and a difficult life for the people. They are now in the worst position.

### Despite the Storms, Britain Stands Firm

Britain is in a better situation than France. The reason is, of course, that the degree of suffering is different. In fact, their political ability is extremely strong, they can come up with solutions, and they can implement them. The most popular material control can really achieve rationality and fairness. With this shared hardship and happiness, the order is also stable. Members of Parliament and public opinion argue with the government every day, and the government has to make everything public to Parliament, debating day and night. However, the country has a regular order and things are not chaotic. A country, an organization, has a particularly strong cohesion, so even after storms, it can stand firm. Everyone agrees that Britain did not win because of anything else, but because of this little bit. This spirit saved Britain! Let's talk about the United States. Yes, he won this war; but the Americans are like a smart, capable, and uninhibited rich man compared to the older, restrained, and respectable gentlemen of Britain.

### The Three Cities of Europe and America: Passionate, Proper, and Lively

The three major cities of Paris, London, and New York are all crowded, but with different atmospheres. The French are full of love and affection everywhere, and men and women hug and kiss each other at any time. The British would never do that, and they all look like proper citizens, not smiling. The United States is too naive and lively. Compared to the British, it seems to have more vitality, but the shortcomings are unavoidable. The order seems to be slightly inferior. A famous city like New York is not as clean as London. Old newspapers, cigarette butts, and ice cream wrappers are often thrown all over the streets, and many people spit everywhere. The worst are the subway stations, which are far worse than those in London, and the stench of the toilets is too ridiculous. However, these places are certainly not all like that.

With victory, the domestic policies of all countries today are centered on the people's livelihood. However, restoration and reconstruction cannot be achieved overnight, so the people's lives must also progress along a curve. For example, in Britain, the current control system will continue for five years. The situation in France is even worse, and the people's belts must continue to be tightened, because in order to improve the standard of living, on the one hand, the supply should be sufficient, and on the other hand, wealth should be increased. The losses during the war must first be compensated. Export trade cannot be delayed, and self-consumption can only be saved. It is like a person who must first revive his career before he can relax and enjoy himself. Otherwise, simply eating and drinking as soon as the money arrives is not the right way. From this point of view, except for the United States, general life must be temporarily tightened, and the standard is not easy to improve immediately. Fortunately, Europeans seem to understand this very well. Their average incomes are low, so there is no way to increase purchasing power, so they will have to make do. This is very worthy of our Chinese people's special awakening. What qualifications do we have to talk about enjoyment at present? However, while the people are starving, the government also has its own responsibilities to protect the people and cultivate the people. Here, a comprehensive social security system is necessary, so that every person has insurance for unemployment, insurance for illness, and from the moment they are born to the end of their lives, they are taken care of by the state and society, so that no one lives in a situation of self-reliance. This is the first and most urgent task of all European and American countries today. Our people must also one day be cared for by everyone.

### Mechanical Development, Everything is Automatic

Due to their machine civilization, everything is automatic. Making phone calls and buying stamps are often unattended. As long as the money goes in, the items come out. In some places, stepping on the steps opens the door, and a light touch produces water and fire. It is simply a kind of net of heaven and earth. However, although machines are very developed, there is still a shortage of manpower. Looking at the situation in Europe and the United States today, women have all come out of the kitchen: typing, secretaries, ticket sellers, salespeople, cashiers, accountants, and even waiters and workers. Women are in charge everywhere, and their work is quite hard, and the treatment is very ordinary. However, according to general observation, the service performance is very good, because they are physically fit and do things seriously.

### Women in Charge, Shifting Social Customs

However, in this way, they are even more laborious when they have a family. It is too fanciful to find a servant. First of all, everyone can find formal employment, why be a servant for others; secondly, the wages are expensive, and ordinary people cannot afford to hire them. Therefore, housework can only be done by yourself. These women are talented both inside and outside, and they are indeed capable. Everyone is not idle. Social customs are therefore easily invigorated, and no one dares to be lazy or opportunistic, or rely on personal connections to muddle through. When they are free, they need male comfort. The most natural way is to seek entertainment with their husbands or boyfriends, and they will no longer look for idlers to play around with and cause trouble. Women are very respected in European and American societies. In Chinese society, women are also often the center in the shadows. Social customs are related to political and academic customs, and their recovery from decline always depends on women, so the relationship of female compatriots is really great.

### The Mine Searchers

Three American sailors stand in the wheelhouse of a damaged American ship, hoping to find pressure-activated mines off the coast of Japan. These sunken mines were dropped by American aircraft before the unconditional surrender of the Japanese and are difficult for ordinary minesweepers to clear. They can automatically become ineffective after a certain period of time, but unless they are actually contacted, there is no way to prove that they have lost their effectiveness. There are three damaged American ships searching for mines, each carrying twenty-two sailors. The engine room is located on the deck, so that the sailors will not be trapped in the lower-level room and suffocate to death in the event of an accident.

### Man Can Conquer Nature, Compatriots Work Hard

"Man can conquer nature," this old saying will never be worn out over time. The so-called "know yourself and know your enemy" is essential. What is the difference between Europeans and Americans and Chinese people? We have some shortcomings, and they also have them, as has been said above. Even though our country's current political and economic situation is difficult, we are not alone. The moral standards of the people may have declined slightly, which is also a fact. Are other people any exception? The prostitutes in Paris and London today are all over the streets, and the news of robberies is constantly reported in British and American newspapers. All of this is clear evidence. What is valuable is that the nation itself has ambition, can be inspired in time, and can strive for self-improvement. Everything will have a solution, and we don't need to be complacent! Furthermore, their great construction and prosperous politics and culture today are also the result of accumulation over time. We have plenty of people, so why can't we catch up and keep pace with them? There is no reason why they can do it and we can't. Based on this belief, the future of China in the next twenty years will be bright. However, we here cannot help but worry: If we only focus on the form and ignore the spiritual foundation, the result will be in vain. When will our politics be enlightened and powerful? More importantly, when will our entire country, from top to bottom, get rid of the mentality of making small calculations, splitting hairs, and only knowing how to plan for personal gain regardless of the overall situation? This is the key to the future fate of the country! (January 5th)

### An Exploration of the Wonders of Dazu Buddhist Statues: A Glimpse of Mature-Period Stone Carvings and Ancient Relics

A Lecture by Mr. Zhu Jinjiang, Reported by Our Newspaper's Airmail Service

The following is a record of about one-tenth of the main points from a two-hour lecture given by Professor Zhu at the request of the Faculty of Arts at Fudan University's Academic Lecture Series, after being invited by local figures in Dazu, Sichuan, to conduct an investigation along with Mr. Gu Jiegang, Mr. Ma Heng, and others. (Jointly recorded by Zhang Jianqing and Shen Yunlong) It is said that his forthcoming books, "A History of Chinese Statuary" and "The Dazu Stone Carvings," will soon be published. (Editor's note: Dazu is located approximately one hundred li northwest of Chongqing)

The Transmission of Buddhist Statues to China

To study stone carvings and statues, one must first understand the history of Buddhism's introduction to our country. According to the "Records of Buddhism," Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty dreamt of a golden man one night. When he inquired of his ministers, they all identified it as Buddha. Thus, he sent Cai Yin and others to Tianzhu (ancient India) to retrieve Buddhist statues and scriptures. However, examining historical facts, this is likely impossible, as it coincided with a period of severed East-West communication. East-West communication effectively began in 138 BC, but at that time, the West had no Buddhist statues, only the Dharma wheel, stupas, Bodhi trees, and Ashoka trees. Even the Songxi Great Stupa and Yu Yuan, which originated around 130 AD, lacked Buddhist statues.

The creation of Indian Buddhist statues flourished during the time of the Kingdom of Gandhara. The Yuezhi king, Kanishka, was a devout Buddhist, and the Greek sculptural styles of the time were spreading to India. Thus, the carving of Buddhist statues began. In the sixteenth year of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty's Yongping reign (74 AD), Ban Chao was dispatched to the Western Regions, and East-West communication became smooth. Zhang Qian, while in the Western Regions, had seen Qiong bamboo and Shu cloth, all transported there from our country by sea. At that time, maritime communication was already established, and Buddhist statues and Buddhist teachings were transmitted to our country from Nanjing. The Jin Dynasty monk Faxian went to India in the ninth year of the Yixi reign (399 AD). This coincided with the Gupta Dynasty, the peak period of Indian statue-making. When he returned to China (413 AD), he brought back Buddhist statues via Qingdao. Furthermore, the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang traveled to India via the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains in the third year of the Zhenguan reign (629 AD). At this time, many Buddhist statues in India had been destroyed, but he also carried back scriptures and images. Wang Xuance traveled to India three times, bringing back even more scriptures and images.

An Overview of Chinese Statuary

Statue-making existed in the Western Jin Dynasty, but none survive today. The Mogao Grottoes were built in the first year of the Taihe reign of Emperor Fei of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (366 AD) by the Qin Dynasty monk Le Zun. Initially, the Chinese people were unaware of them. It was not until 1903 that they were discovered by the Hungarian Aurel Stein. After returning to Europe, he praised them highly, leading to the subsequent arrival of the Englishman Stein, who used various methods to take away the essence of the grottoes, seventy large boxes, back to London. In 1907, the Frenchman Paul Pelliot also came to the Mogao Grottoes, taking over a thousand photographs. He returned and wrote "The Mogao Grottoes Catalogue." From this, the Chinese people began to learn of the Mogao Grottoes. The grottoes built by the monk Tan Yao in Yungang, Datong, Shanxi, during the sixth year of the Daming reign of Emperor Xiaowu of the Northern Wei Dynasty, along with the Binyang Cave in Longmen (Luoyang) built by the Northern Wei Dynasty around 500 AD, and various grottoes in Tianlong Mountain in Taiyuan, etc., from the late Tang to the Northern Song Dynasty, were the most prosperous period for statue-making in our country. The sculptor Yang Huizhi during the Xuanzong era was truly a great creative talent in the history of Chinese statue-making and a pivotal figure in the shift of styles.

In the early stages of statue-making in our country, it was nothing more than imitation. In the later stages, creation began. In terms of appearance, early statues imitated the appearance of Indians, gradually changing to resemble Han Chinese. Statues from the Tang Dynasty often had full faces, while those from the Song Dynasty were relatively thin, influenced by the era. As for the folds of clothing, they did not resemble the thin, translucent clothing of India, but rather repeated, rhythmic patterns. The headdresses in the Gandhara style were quite simple, while the headdresses in our country's statues were complex and detailed, with over twenty different styles. In terms of posture, Indian statues often sat upright, while Chinese statues often sat in the lotus position.

The Dazu Stone Carvings are divided into two areas: Beishan and Baodingshan.

The Current State of the Dazu Stone Carvings

(A) Beishan: Yongchang Village was built by Wei Junjing, the Tang Dynasty prefect. The statues date from the second year of the Qianning reign of Emperor Zhaozong of the Tang Dynasty (895 AD) to the sixteenth year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty (1146 AD). The various caves are described below:

(1) The Cave in Front of Weituo Heaven: The front of the cave features an image of the Northern Heavenly King Weituo Heaven (also known as the Heavenly King of Much Hearing). The Heavenly King is the protector of the Buddhist faith, and Wei Junjing was the prefect of Changzhou at the time. He built Yongchang Village here to protect the region, so this image is actually Prefect Wei. Beside the Heavenly King are two Yakshas. On the left is a donor with two pheasant feathers on his head, which is related to "ancient totemism." On the right is a Thousand-Hand Guanyin, but upon closer examination, it is Vishnu, not Guanyin, as its eyes are fierce, and it is often depicted as a Heavenly King. Similar statues can also be found in the Yungang Grottoes in Datong.

(2) The Back Cave: There are inscriptions about the statues, dating from the third and fifth years of the Yongping reign (915 AD) and the third year of the Qianning reign (896 AD). The statues include Guanyin, Dizang, and Amitabha.

(3) The Guanyin Cave: The statues are mostly blurred due to repeated repairs. On the left is an image with a scarf on its head, dressed like a court lady. In another small cave is an image with a flowing robe, extremely lifelike, clearly influenced by the painting styles of the time, with the charm of "Wu's flowing robes against the wind."

(4) The Tathagata Cave: Very large, it depicts the Tathagata preaching the Dharma, with donors, as well as images of Guanyin, Samantabhadra, and Manjushri. There is a Dharma wheel in front, but unfortunately, it is damaged. On the right side of the wall is an inscription depicting Manjushri visiting Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness, painted by Shi Ke of the Song Dynasty.

England's Living Symbol: George VI - Can He Sit Securely on the Throne?

Since the establishment of a purely Labour government, the position of the English King has seemed theoretically paradoxical, although in practice, he has cooperated very well with the new government machinery, as if the English throne was originally established for today's socialist political experiment. Labour Party members have no intention of interfering with the throne in the slightest. On the contrary, just as European monarchs are collapsing one after another in the storms of leftism, the English system remains standing like the Rock of Gibraltar. From all perspectives, it is easy to believe that King George VI was born to cope with the current political crisis. George VI is a common man. If King Edward VII, the current king's grandfather, or his father, George V, or Edward VIII, who abdicated because of his marriage to Mrs. Simpson, were on the throne today, the situation would be completely different. These former kings were all strong-willed men who would often assert their royal authority in front of their cabinet, sometimes insisting on doing things according to their own views. Once, during an inspection of coal mines in Wales, he was so enraged by the poor conditions of the workers (of course, this is absolute) that he sternly said on the spot that something had to be done, thus rebuking his government, which was actually planning to improve the mining industry at the time. The English throne was originally supposed to be inherited by Edward, but fate caused George VI to ascend the throne. As for the Queen, she has a wealth of common sense and ardent loyalty, which is of great help to her husband. Her heart is really no different from that of a Scottish housewife, but she can carry out her duties with dignity and understanding. In short, the English King, the living symbol of the United Kingdom, is still sitting securely on his throne. (24th, Mackenzie, London)

### A Tour of Huangpu Harbor: A Revolutionary Holy Land Continuing to Shine

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng, Guangzhou

Although science has advanced to the age of atomic energy, if we do not deny that only 30 percent of the earth is land and 70 percent is ocean, then the navy naturally has its importance in national defense. Our country's navy was indeed pitifully lacking in the past. During the post-war reconstruction, the authorities paid special attention to building a new navy. Therefore, "Huangpu," a place with good naval port conditions, has not been neglected by the authorities. After the liberation of Guangzhou, the authorities first ordered the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau to draft a plan for the development of Huangpu, in order to accelerate its progress. On December 27th of last year, the US Naval Military Mission, led by Rear Admiral Merrell, along with seven officers, came to Guangdong to inspect Huangpu Port. Because Huangpu has the potential to develop into a naval base and deep-water port, I visited it in person the other day.

Two Clumps of Green Trees: Huangpu in Sight

On a clear and beautiful morning, a small steamer, shimmering in the golden light, carved a broken line on the calm surface of the Pearl River, heading towards Huangpu. After an hour and fifteen minutes of sailing, Huangpu emerged from a clump of green trees on the horizon. With an excited heart, I gazed at this place, inseparable from the revolution, as if seeing it emitting dignity and sacred light. We will not forget its contribution to China. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Huangpu Military Academy, its glory has remained to this day, and that glory has continued to shine from the Northern Expedition to the victory of the War of Resistance.

Vast and Strategic Waters: Fleets Gathered

The Huangpu waters are vast, controlling the Pearl River estuary and controlling the entire waterway, making the terrain extremely strategic. Three warships of 200 to 300 tons and twelve 25-ton gunboats berthed at the shore immediately caught our eyes. These were enemy vessels received by the Guangdong region and then renamed. Among them, the "Wufeng" was the largest of the three shallow-water gunboats, weighing 300 tons, equipped with two three-inch flat-trajectory guns, and capable of a speed of no less than seven knots. It is still navigable. The other two, "Victory" and "Revival," are river patrol ships, weighing 200 tons and 180 tons respectively. Originally, these two ships were equipped with steel cannons, but they had been removed during the handover and are now awaiting repair before they can be navigated, with a "speed" of about six knots.

Ships Berthed at the Docks: Scattered Like Stars

After visiting these warships one by one, we went to another dock. There were also countless ships there, berthed like stars scattered across the sky. Eight 25-ton wooden Pu-class gunboats and four 25-ton iron Te-class gunboats. These Te-class gunboats were equipped with a twin-barreled machine gun and several heavy machine guns, as well as searchlights. The speed reaches 12 knots per hour. These have all been reorganized by our naval authorities after receiving them. In the future, Guangdong will have three patrol fleets, and this group of ships is the Third Fleet. Colonel Huang Rukang of the Naval Commissioner's Office told reporters: "After the Hong Kong government hands over the enemy ships to our country, we will use them to train the navy. We are now preparing to establish a naval soldiers' training class and hire many American consultants and instructors to assist us..."

Two Dry Docks and Sluice Gates: Relics of a Century

Afterwards, we visited the naval shipyard. This factory was a product of the Zhang Zhidong era. The two dry docks and sluice gates, built over a hundred years ago, are still intact. However, because the riverbed is silted up 210 miles upstream and downstream, it must be thoroughly dredged before it can accommodate large ships. This shipyard can now only repair ships, not manufacture them. The factory has a forge, a foundry, and a sawmill, all powered by electricity. The foundry has two electric motors of more than 80 horsepower, and the power plant also has two generators of 42 horsepower. In addition, there are diving coppersmiths.

Japanese Prisoners Work at the Factory: Taking Time to Fish

The current director of the factory is Mr. Wu Qushi. There are 65 Japanese prisoners working in the factory, and their lives seem to be very comfortable. When I left the shipyard, I saw several Japanese prisoners leisurely sitting by the dock, fishing!

After the visit, following the Xiaoyuan Road, we stepped onto a small ferry, looking up at the bronze statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the long stele of the "East River Martyrs' Memorial Field," personally inscribed by President Chiang, standing majestically on the riverbank, as imposing as ever. For decades, the revolutionary holy land painstakingly managed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang has also been restored to its former glory with the victory of the War of Resistance. Recalling the past achievements, how should we carry forward the glory of Huangpu and how should we build this deep and wide Huangpu harbor! (January 14th)

### The Method of Selling at Low Prices Should Be Rectified

Editor: We, the small citizens of Shanghai, have suffered from the oppression of eight years of life. With victory, everyone wants to breathe a sigh of relief, but before we could breathe, even heavier pressure came. For example, recently the newspapers have been continuously publishing news and notices of sales at low prices, including all daily necessities, such as cloth, flour, sugar, oil, meat, fish, eggs... and the quantities are quite large, so the small citizens thought they could breathe a sigh of relief. But the reality is by no means as wonderful as the "news." After returning from several failed attempts to join the "long snake lines," I read the various reports about the low-price sales in the newspapers and summarized them as follows:

(1) The sales time is inaccurate, and the people in charge deliberately "drag their feet."

(2) The limited amount of goods for sale does not match the announcement. The regulation is three jin of edible oil per household, but some households are limited to only half a jin.

(3) The quantity of goods sold is far less than the "notice" stated, which is obviously being secretly swallowed by the stores in charge.

(4) The order is chaotic, and scalpers abound.

(5) Some people can openly buy without queuing, and the quantity is even larger.

In short, if this continues, the small citizens will definitely not benefit. I urge the authorities to seriously consider and find ways to improve the situation. If the authorities intend to hold such sales regularly, they can utilize the newly established Baojia organization, refer to the quantitative distribution system, and improve it to bring it onto the right track, so that it does not become as chaotic, disorganized, and unplanned as it is now. If the authorities are only trying to meet the current needs, they should also strengthen supervision so that the stores in charge cannot "engulf" the goods, and the scalpers cannot "operate," so that the genuine small citizens can finally breathe a sigh of relief!

Editorial

### Today, Do Not Disappoint the People!

Today should be the day of the closing of the Political Consultative Conference. Two weeks of grand discussions and endless debates, extended by three days, have now come to an end. The people of the whole country are eagerly awaiting the good news of an agreement. However, according to Chongqing's daily telegrams, the conference is either in a "delicate stage" or "it is still doubtful whether the task can be completed." Thirty-eight party leaders, social elites, spent seventeen days racking their brains, thinking hard, working day and night. If today they still cannot come up with a reasonable and legal concrete way to end the country's internal strife and open up the foundation of civil rule, how will they be able to face the people? Every member of the Political Consultative Conference claims to represent the people, but I wonder how many truly understand the true will of the people! Let's be honest, what the people expect today is still simple and clear, nothing more than "returning the army to the state and returning the government to the people," eight big characters. Any other flowery words are trivial matters. The members should ask themselves, in these seventeen days of numerous arguments, have they discussed a solution for these eight big characters? If the consultation does not lead to a decision, or the decision is not implemented, or the implementation is not thorough, or the implementation is not thorough and there is no punishment, then these seventeen days of consultation, whether in the plenary session or in the group sessions, will still end up with "consulting" but not "agreeing," which would be a waste of effort. The people's disappointment with national affairs will be no greater than this. But today, the overall situation of the country cannot disappoint the people again. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference can only succeed and cannot fail.

However, the situation of the conference is still not optimistic in its "delicate" state. Why? The main reason is that some of the high officials participating in the conference are sincere, while others may not be! We hope that this statement is wrong, but we are also deeply worried that even if this statement is not accurate, it is not far off. Let's put it bluntly, if everyone does not have the sincerity to serve the country and the people, then consultation is superfluous. Why can't we see all parties showing their sincerity today? Let's take a look: What exactly have they been discussing for these ten days?

The military group was originally supposed to discuss a way to return the army to the state, but although the Military Mediation Execution Department has begun its work, and the order to cease the conflict has been issued for more than ten days, there are still contacts in various places. This has already left a bad impression on the people. In addition, the reorganization of the Communist army was already agreed upon to be carried out by another three-person group, but at present, the Communist Party wants to mix it up with the reorganization of the national army to delay the process. The Communist Party has forgotten the "Double Tenth Agreement" during this consultation, weakening the power of the three-person military group, and even saying that the Communist army will accept government orders only after the implementation of constitutionalism. No wonder the local conflicts are still intermittent. As for how much sincerity they have in "returning the army to the state," everyone will know.

We still do not know what the government organization group has agreed upon, but they say that the Communist Party insists that all parties participate in the central government and local governments, ostensibly to "unite to the end," but in essence to "divide to the end." It is really hard to know what they are thinking about the people. The people have no other requirements for the political system, except to transition from political tutelage to constitutionalism in stability, and for the Kuomintang to return the government to the people in accordance with the law. They do not want to see everyone muddling the waters, using the name of "coalition government" to actually divide the government. However, according to the Communist Party's proposal, their region, under the sweet-sounding smokescreen of "popular election" and "liberation," does not allow anyone to interfere, while the central government and other provincial and municipal local governments must be shared by the Communist Party and all parties. In other words, their wishful thinking is "My place is only mine, but your place also has mine." Whether it is fair or not, let's not discuss it for now. We only ask: If we must unite to the end and divide to the end, does it conform to returning the government to the people? We, the people, only know that the government is whole, and the whole belongs to the people. Whoever the people trust, they will elect to represent them. Whichever party the people trust, they will elect to represent them. But today, the Communist Party is self-bragging and boasting about its three-thirds system, saying that the Communist Party's elected officials in his region are limited to one-third (truth or falsehood, God knows!). Therefore, they say that the Kuomintang cannot exceed one-third in all departments. We would like to ask again, if the people all believe in the Communist Party and elect the Communist Party, why can the Communist Party limit them to only elect one-third? Is this politeness democratic or undemocratic? Conversely, if the people in a certain place still do not consider the Kuomintang unworthy and elect more members of the Kuomintang, who can limit them and deprive them of their rights? Please understand that the Chinese people are still learning democracy and practicing elections. Don't let your imagination run wild and fabricate terms (such as the three-thirds system) to confuse their minds! If this continues, China will suffer from the loss of being named "united" but actually "divided," and will never properly embark on the road of democratic politics, and the Kuomintang's original intention of "returning the government to the people" may therefore change its nature and become dividing the government among various parties. We only ask the Kuomintang to sincerely return the government to the people, not to go down the wrong path, and let the people suffer again from the common oppression of various parties.

In short, the goal we require is simple: the army should belong to the state; the government should be returned to the people; the political program should be simple and clear and in line with national conditions; the draft constitution should be based on the spirit of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution and should not deviate from it; the National Assembly must be convened on May 5th as scheduled, the original representatives are legally valid, but they can be supplemented and inclusive. The members of the Political Consultative Conference must be able to deliver a reasonable and justified account of these major events before the closing of the conference, so that the people will not be disappointed again!

### Military Ammunition Train Explosion Near Zhenru - Beijing-Shanghai Train Service Resumed Yesterday Morning - Passengers Arrive Safely at Nanxiang Station

[Report from Our Newspaper] The No. 502 mixed freight train, departing from the North Station the night before and bound for Nanjing, consisted of twenty fourth-class passenger cars, fourteen coal cars, three ammunition cars belonging to the General Directorate of the Ordnance Depot of the X War Zone, and lastly, the conductor's car. It was originally scheduled to depart at 5:30 PM, but due to delays in the handover of the train, it only left the North Station at 7:35 PM. Unexpectedly, twenty minutes into the journey, fifteen kilometers from Zhenru Station, the first ammunition car suddenly caught fire.

**Ammunition Explodes - Red Light Illuminates the Sky**

Upon discovering the fire, the conductor Zhou Taosheng urgently turned the steam valve open and brought the train to a complete stop. He then bravely dismounted and detached the seven cars in front of the ammunition car. He immediately ordered the military driver to quickly drive the twenty passenger cars and seven coal cars to Nanxiang. This swift action took only five minutes. By this time, the ammunition had caught fire and was exploding continuously, illuminating the sky with flames. Conductor Zhou then detoured to a nearby communication station and urgently telegraphed the Shanghai North Main Station to report the incident. The lives of the twenty passengers were thus saved.

**Repairs Conducted Overnight - Train Service Resumed**

Upon receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Station immediately dispatched dozens of people in two special trains to the scene of the accident, including the Director of the Military Affairs Department, Hou Huohua, the Deputy Director of the Public Works Department, Xu Chengkuang, the Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Transport Section, Ouyang Zhi, advisor Li Weichen, and rescue and repair workers. At that time, the explosions had not ceased, and bullets were flying in all directions. They were forced to wait until 11:00 PM when the fire had subsided slightly, before all personnel began repair work. First, they reconnected the telephone and telegraph lines along the line and towed the exploded cars and coal cars to Yangqi Station. At the same time, they dispatched personnel to Nanxiang, ordering the No. 502 train engine stationed there to be refilled with water, re-fired, and continue its journey. The entire repair work took four hours. As of 8:00 AM yesterday morning, train service had returned to normal.

**Soldiers Jump from Train - Four Injured**

The ammunition loaded in the train consisted mostly of bullets, hand grenades, and other explosive materials. It was guarded by six armed soldiers. During the explosion, the escorting soldiers jumped from the train, with four of them injured. One was seriously injured, while the other three sustained minor skin injuries and were not in serious condition.

**Cause of the Accident - Under Investigation**

Yesterday, according to Ouyang Zhi, the Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Transport Section, who spoke to a reporter from this newspaper, fortunately, the conductor was alert and acted quickly, ensuring that no passengers were killed or injured in this unfortunate incident. The railway bureau will commend him for his actions. Last night (the 24th), I was ordered to go to the scene of the accident to oversee the situation. I saw that within 30 meters of the explosion, the ground was covered with bullet marks and shrapnel. The roadbed was only damaged to the extent of a dozen or so sleepers. The three covered freight cars carrying the ammunition were severely damaged, while the two coal cars next to them sustained minor damage. The rest were unharmed. When the explosion occurred, nearby residents were alarmed, but they were reassured by the road protection team and quickly calmed down. The cause of the accident is being investigated by military police, who have taken the three soldiers escorting the train to Shanghai for questioning. As for our bureau, we had carefully considered the order of the cars before the incident, placing the twenty passenger cars behind the engine, followed by the fourteen coal cars, and finally the ammunition cars, to prevent sparks from the engine from falling onto the ammunition.

**Notice Posted at the Entrance of the North Station**

Furthermore, due to the train explosion the night before, the overnight express train to Beijing that was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai, and the fourth-class slow train at 1:00 AM yesterday, both departed at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. At the same time, the express train from Beijing to Shanghai, which had been blocked at Huangdu, arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM sharp. Tong Shida, the director of the Shanghai North Main Station, posted an emergency notice at the entrance of the North Station, stating: "It has been found that the No. 502 mixed freight train departing from Shanghai North Station yesterday (January 24th) at 7:50 PM, while traveling 15 kilometers from Zhenru Station, experienced an explosion in one of the freight cars due to the carelessness of the guard overseeing the straw. The conductor took emergency and courageous action to detach the car, and all passengers safely arrived at Nanxiang Station without any casualties. Subsequently, senior employees from relevant departments of this railway personally rushed to the scene of the accident overnight to conduct repairs, which were fully completed and resumed normal train service at 8:00 AM this morning (January 25th). This is hereby announced."

### Transfer of Japanese Naval Prisoners of War Today

The Japanese naval prisoners of war under the jurisdiction of the former Naval Headquarters, who were concentrated in the Fuxing Island and Pudong concentration camps, will be taken over by the Japanese Prisoner of War Management Office of the Beijing-Shanghai District, which has received orders to do so. The office has already consulted with the Shanghai Office of the Naval Department several times, and the Prisoner of War Management Office is scheduled to officially take over today. The repatriation of the prisoners will begin in due course. Furthermore, a large number of Japanese residents have been transported to Shanghai from various places in Beijing and Zhenjiang in recent days. The Japanese Residents Management Office has already opened a concentration camp for Japanese residents arriving from inland areas on Fuxing Island.

### National Identification Cards to Be Issued in Early March

The work of compiling and investigating the 31 districts of the city has been largely completed, and a census is now underway. This work is expected to be completed by the end of February, and national identification cards will be issued in early March.

### Reorganization of the Artillery Regiment of the Third Army Group

The Artillery Regiment of the Third Army Group, led by Regiment Commander Wu Daoyuan, has arrived in Shanghai with all its officers and soldiers to undergo reorganization and training. The regiment has now been ordered to be reorganized into the 7th Artillery Regiment of the Army, still under the command of the Third Army Group.

### Municipal Museum Discovers Existing Cultural Relics

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Museum Resumption Office, it has been actively pursuing existing cultural relics. These existing cultural relics were deposited at Aurora University before the war. They were stolen by traitors and puppets in 1943. After the Education Bureau dispatched personnel to cooperate with the Police Bureau in their efforts to pursue and search for them, they were discovered in a warehouse at the former site of the Pseudo-Cultural Relics Handling Committee on Bailinan Road. The inventory has now been completed, and the museum is currently organizing them.

### Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court Hears Five Traitor Cases Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court heard five more cases of traitors yesterday. The details are as follows:

He Musheng, 40 years old, from Minhang, served as a secret agent for the enemy's Sijing Gendarmerie, committing many evils, including extorting the people and arresting our guerrillas. However, the defendant vehemently denied the charges in court yesterday, and the court ordered a further hearing at a later date.

Zhu Bingrong, 27 years old, from Yangzhou, and his wife, who is still at large, both served as intelligence officers in the enemy's Naval Landing Force. He arrested Yang Hengchang and two others, accusing them of being members of the Big Sword Society, and extorted their families. Yesterday, the victim's family member, Yang Hong, as well as Li Shi, Han Wang, and witness Ma Qinglin, testified in court. The defendant still tried to deny the charges, and the court ordered a further hearing at a later date.

Cao Yaoting, a graduate of a law and political science college, served as a temporary clerk in the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court before the war. Later, he willingly defected to the enemy and led the enemy puppets to take over the local court on November 8, 1940. Cao was then promoted to prosecutor of the puppet court. Those who were unwilling to defect were tied up and threatened at "76," a notorious puppet security organization. During his tenure, he specialized in extortion. He was dismissed and wanted by the puppet Ministry of Justice and Administration, but was never apprehended due to the protection of Li Shiqun, the head of "76." After the victory, he was arrested by our Changju branch and transferred to the court. Yesterday, the defendant denied all charges in court, falsely claiming to be an underground worker who rescued supplies and transported youths to the interior. The court ordered a further hearing after investigation.

In the afternoon, the collegiate panel continued to hear the cases of Fang Zude and Wang Shiliang. Fang was a driver for the enemy's Wusong Gendarmerie, and Wang was a secret agent for the enemy's Gendarmerie, who had framed our underground worker Xu Zhong. The court ordered that the sentences be announced on the afternoon of the 31st.

### New Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, to Take Office in a Few Days - Key Personnel Have Been Selected

It is reported that Okada is a major war criminal listed on the U.S. blacklist. He was involved in intelligence work and was transferred to Shanghai in February last year to work in the enemy's 13th Army Staff Headquarters stationed in Shanghai. The U.S. had been investigating and arresting him for a long time. It was previously rumored that he had returned to Tokyo, but the U.S. search in Tokyo was unsuccessful. Later, it was rumored that he was in Nanjing and Hankou, but he was not found. It was not until the day before yesterday that it was learned that he was indeed in the Shanghai concentration camp.

### Two Special Trains Daily for Returning Home for the New Year

In view of the approaching Lunar New Year and the increased number of passengers returning home for the New Year, the authorities of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways have adopted emergency transportation measures. These passengers are mostly people returning to northern Jiangsu and various places in Hangzhou, Fuyang, and Ningbo. The existing vehicles are unable to cope with the demand. From the 27th to the 31st of this month (i.e., from the 25th to the 29th of the Lunar month), two special fourth-class trains will be temporarily added for people returning home for the New Year. One train will be specially opened to Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing, selling tickets east of Danyang, specifically to facilitate passengers returning to northern Jiangsu, Huaiyang, and various places in Beijing, Anhui. One train will be specially opened to Hangzhou, specifically to facilitate passengers returning to Hangzhou and transferring to various places in Zhejiang. These special trains will each run once a day. The fare to Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing is uniformly 500 yuan in national currency. Ticket sales begin at 7:00 PM every day at the entrance to the left of the Songhu Line ticket office. The fare to Hangzhou is 380 yuan. Ticket sales begin at 9:00 AM at the West Station. Passengers can board the train immediately after purchasing tickets, and the train will depart when it is full. However, porters are not allowed to board the train, so each passenger is limited to one hand-carried bag.

**First Batch of Super-type Locomotives Arriving Soon**

In order to expedite the restoration of transportation facilities, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has shipped a large amount of transportation equipment from the United States. The first batch, consisting of more than ten American super-type locomotives, is expected to arrive within two weeks and may be unloaded here. However, the allocation of the locomotives will be decided by the Ministry of Transportation's Railroad Administration. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways may utilize half of them to expedite the improvement of transportation in the Beijing-Shanghai region. As for the original locomotives that have been repaired, more than 30 have been completed and have been fully allocated to the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Puxu sections of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The Puxu section's express train has also resumed service as a result.

### Seventeen Factories Affiliated with the China Textile Corporation Resuming Work This Morning - Labor Disputes in Commercial Publishing and Barber Shops Resolved

In recent weeks, labor disputes in Shanghai have been surging. Factories and stores have been striking or engaging in slowdowns due to demands for adjusted wages and the issuance of year-end bonuses. Currently, after much mediation, the seventeen factories affiliated with the China Textile Corporation, including Rihua, Neiwei Cotton, etc., reached a satisfactory resolution yesterday afternoon through the mediation of Lu Jingshi, a special commissioner from the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Li Jianhua, the director of the Third Office of the Social Affairs Bureau, who convened both labor and management at the Social Affairs Bureau. It is hoped that work will fully resume this morning.

In addition, each person will receive a special bonus of 10,000 yuan and six yards of Indanthrene blue fabric.

It was decided that wages would be adjusted after Wang Yunwu returns to Shanghai. The management would first lend each person 20,000 yuan, which would be returned after the wages were adjusted. The Rong side was satisfied and scheduled to resume work this morning.

**Barber Shop Workers Resuming Work This Morning**

**Eight Major Department Stores Continue Slowdown Yesterday**

Yong'an, Xianshi, Xinxin, Daxin, and the other eight major department stores continued their slowdown all day yesterday. Labor and management were unable to fully reach an agreement. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau proposed that employee salaries be paid at the rate of 30,000 yuan per month as assessed by the review committee, with meals at their own expense. The management generally accepted this in principle. According to unofficial statements from the labor side, their minimum concession is that in addition to the monthly salary of 30,000 yuan, they must also be subsidized with 7,500 yuan for meals. Yesterday, all the department stores remained open but did not sell goods.

**Mediation Unsuccessful for Ewo Factory Workers**

More than 10,000 workers at the British Ewo cotton mill are demanding immediate resumption of work and the payment of victory bonuses and severance pay. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated three times without result. Thousands of workers marched in front of the Ewo foreign firm on the Bund yesterday.

**Other Factories Still Fluctuate**

The strike at Shenxin No. 6 Factory and Chongxin Cotton Mill has been resolved, and work has resumed. The Guangqin Cotton Mill is still in a stalemate. Yesterday, the Tongyi Cotton Mill went on strike in protest over year-end bonuses. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated the labor dispute at the Power Company, but no satisfactory result was achieved.

**Jeep Drivers Resumed Work Yesterday**

More than 2,000 Chinese drivers, coppersmiths, and laborers at the U.S. military headquarters' transportation office in Shanghai went on strike to demand improved treatment. The management authorities set a deadline for reporting back to work and promised to increase the salary of those with a minimum wage of 600 yuan per day by 100 yuan, and so on for those above 600 yuan. Work resumed yesterday morning.

### China Silk Company: Avoiding Competition with the People, Taking Over Silk Factories to Resume Production

(Report from this newspaper) According to Mr. Ge Jingzhong, the General Manager of the China Silk Company, told reporters that the company's current business plan is to promote the two major principles of assisting private enterprises and improving research. Regarding the principle of assisting private enterprises, in terms of technology, the company will recruit technical personnel and use scientific methods to guide and improve private silk businesses. Economically, the company will try its best to help private silk businesses that accept guidance to obtain low-interest loans from national banks. In terms of the principle of improvement and research, the company plans to set up demonstration nurseries, demonstration breeding grounds, and demonstration silk factories. Research departments will be set up in these basic business institutions to introduce research results to private nurseries, breeding grounds, and silk factories. Therefore, future work will focus on the cultivation and development of basic businesses within the scope of avoiding competition with the people as much as possible. Mr. Ge also said that in the past, China's silk competitors in the world market were only Japan. China's silk production has advantages in terms of weather, geography, and labor. All conditions are far superior to Japan. The difference is the lack of application of scientific methods, which has led to a daily increase in production costs. Therefore, if we carefully study and reduce costs in the future, it will not be difficult for China to gain an advantage in the world silk market. The company has recently decided to send personnel to Taiwan to breed spring silkworms for the 35th year, using the original mulberry varieties in Taiwan to raise silkworms. It is understood that China's silkworm seeds can be self-sufficient. All personnel going to Taiwan are ready and will set sail south as soon as they receive a reply from the Taiwan Provincial Government.

### Shipping Industry Groups Declaration: Defending Shipping Rights

Various shipping-related organizations in Shanghai, in view of the painful past of losing shipping rights, the difficulty of recovering shipping rights, and the current crisis of wavering shipping rights, held an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Shipping Club at No. 93 Guangdong Road. They unanimously resolved the following:

Resolved Key Issues

(1) Issue a joint declaration to defend shipping rights. (2) Send a telegram to the government, urging it to earnestly protect the integrity of territorial waters and shipping rights based on the new treaty, and to prohibit ships flying foreign flags from engaging in domestic river and coastal trade. (3) If ships flying foreign flags navigate domestic rivers or coastal areas, infringing on China's shipping rights, Chinese seamen, dockworkers, and all other employees related to the shipping industry will absolutely not cooperate with them. (4) Send a telegram to the government requesting it to follow the precedents of various countries and quickly compensate 300,000 tons of private ships sacrificed in this war to restore the original transportation capacity. (5) Send a telegram to the government requesting it to quickly repair existing ships and other shipping equipment, and to fully utilize the allocation of ships nationwide, matching ship performance with waterways, and taking into account both military and civilian transportation. (6) Send a telegram to the government ordering the customs authorities to restore navigation markers in the Yangtze River and coastal areas as soon as possible, and requesting the naval authorities to quickly clear mines to restore night navigation and increase transportation capacity.

Joint Declaration

Briefly stated: Now that the War of Resistance has been won and unequal treaties have been abolished, we suddenly hear that foreign merchants are using the transportation of materials from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration as an excuse to demand that ships flying foreign flags operate in our inland rivers and coastal areas. Our shipping-related organizations hereby solemnly declare to China and foreign countries with a sincere and firm attitude that we will resist any action or attempt to infringe upon our inland river and coastal shipping rights with the spirit of bloody resistance and arduous struggle over the past eight years. Finally, at this epoch-making stage in the history of China's shipping industry, we sincerely hope that our government will consider the heavy sacrifices made by private shipping companies for the country over the past eight years, the difficulty of the revival of the national shipping industry, and the urgent measures such as advance compensation for requisitioned ships, the maximum utilization of existing ships, the full supply of ship fuel, the rapid establishment of navigation markers, practical assistance in shipping construction, and comprehensive planning for both military and civilian transportation, especially the preservation of river and sea shipping rights. We also hope that our friendly countries, especially the United States, which has helped us the most, will transfer a portion of their large surplus of ships to our country under reasonable economic conditions so that we can achieve the revival of the shipping industry and the magnificence of shipping rights as soon as possible. The Chinese shipping industry and even the Chinese nation will always be grateful for this kind of genuine friendship. In addition to sending telegrams to the government and the competent authorities, we hereby declare this.

### Tight Credit at the End of the Lunar Year: Gold and Paper Money Decline Across the Board, Many New Hong Kong Dollar Notes Being Sold

Yesterday, the Shanghai dollar depreciated because of the slight decline in the Chongqing market and the unusually tight overnight positions. Major players had no intention of participating, so the market trend was extremely weak. The market opened slightly lower in the morning, and continued to be supplied by US dollar arbitrage sellers after the opening. It fell from 9.16 million to below the 9 million level. However, at this time, there were more bargain hunters, and the market fluctuated around the 9 million level for a long time. But in the end, due to the lack of stimulus at the end of the year, it could not sustain and fell again near noon, falling below 8.9 million. The morning session closed at 8.92 million, down 24,000 from the previous close. Transactions were sparse in the afternoon, and the spot price did not deviate much from the morning close. Overnight transactions opened slightly stable, but the industry and outsiders were uninterested, and there was little change in the end. Futures also fell by 24,000. Gold jewelry in jewelry stores was 96,000, silver taels were 800 yuan, and silver dollars rose to 490 yuan due to Japan's increase in silver prices. Dark interest rates for daily loans ranged from 10% to 12%, and 14% for loans over the New Year.

Foreign currency US dollars lacked special stimulus, and inflows and outflows were scattered. The Chongqing market reported a slight decline, and the market opened slightly lower at 1,463 yuan in the morning. Sellers followed one after another, and arbitrage trading was also a small amount of activity. By noon, the market had retreated to 1,442 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to fluctuate within 1,450 yuan, which was unusually mediocre. As a result, it fell by 21 yuan. Hong Kong dollar notes softened slightly yesterday. Cotton settlement and overseas remittances stopped slightly. Old notes fell back by 5 yuan. New notes collapsed due to speculative forces, and there were still many sellers, continuing to fall by 3 yuan.

### Speculative Sentiment Wanes: Stock Prices Repeatedly Hit Lows

The Shanghai stock market felt surrounded by enemies on all sides. Major players were willing but unable to act. Many people realized that if they did not advance, they would retreat, and continued to unwind positions. The supply of shares suddenly loosened, and each stock fell step by step. Although there were struggles along the way, they did not help the overall situation. The morning session closed with lower prices across the board. The downward trend was still weak. The morning close resulted in Yong Yarn falling by 170 yuan, Mei Ya falling by 110 yuan, Xin He falling by 50 yuan, and Jingfu and other three small popular stocks falling by about 10% each. Each unpopular stock also fell slightly.

Although small and medium-sized foreign stocks fell, they did not fall much. Large-cap and rubber stocks were less strong. This was due to the tight credit situation, which put pressure on the bottom line. Speculative sentiment in the Shanghai stock market has subsided. Foreign stocks seem unlikely to escape this trend. However, foreign stocks have fixed closing times, unlike the Shanghai stock market, which has no clear rules. Although weak, the process was still relatively smooth. As a result, except for Yi Beer, each stock softened slightly. Jardine Matheson fell by 1,200 yuan.

### Retail Investors Suffer Enough: Government Bonds Fall Step by Step

Many parties did not dare to hold onto government bonds. Due to the end of the year, credit was extremely tight. The bond market had no support from major players. A certain firm previously bought a large number of Sichuan Bank's Class C bonds, with the intention of selling them at a good price. However, the counterparties had difficulties, and it was not easy to sell. There were several attempts to sell and then stop. By noon, they had no choice but to painfully cut losses. Class C bonds gradually broke through four major levels from 1,630 yuan, reaching a low of 1,290 yuan. The morning close was only maintained by major players in the industry, returning to above 1,300. The results were down 110 yuan for Class A and B, 240 yuan for Class C, 120 yuan for Class D, and 130 yuan for Class E. The general psychology gradually broke down on the various lavish expectations that had been spread before, and another group of retail investors suffered.

### Yarn Market Remains Short of Supply

The yarn market remained firm yesterday. Customer sales were unusually active. Weaving factories were willing to purchase. The price of each type of yarn rose again by 20,000. Sixteen-count Guangming yarn was bought and sold by many, with the price closing from 445,000 yuan to 470,000 yuan. Fangjian Company continued to supply, but it was gradually becoming short of supply. People's minds are optimistic, and the trend remains strong.

### Tight Cotton Prices: Sparse Cotton Cloth Transactions

Cotton transactions were less active. Only the Zhongfang Spinning Mill purchased 42-count raw American cotton middling at a price of 62,000 yuan, which was the price delivered to the factory. In addition, the Hua Hao purchased 16-count raw cotton Huo Ji at prices of 42,000 yuan and 44,000 yuan. Seed cotton was quoted at 8,200 yuan and 8,300 yuan. The above prices were all for delivery at the warehouse. Prices were tighter than the previous day.

In the cotton cloth market, those who held goods with real strength were unwilling to sell them again, because it was still impossible to predict what the spring market would look like. Conversely, those whose funds were overdrawn from banks were now in the period of major settlement and were also ending their transactions. Therefore, the volume of transactions was unusually low.

### Weak Silk Market: Silk Fabrics and Loans Are Stagnant

Yesterday, the first transaction price of 120-day Tianjin artificial silk was 1.12 million yuan, followed by an increase of 20,000 yuan. The afternoon price was 1.13 million yuan. Very few transactions were made. The warehouse receipt was sold for 720,000 yuan in the morning and quoted at 730,000 yuan in the afternoon, a difference of 400,000 yuan from the spot price. The reason was that there were rumors that customs duties would have to be paid for the goods to be delivered in the future, so the price of the warehouse receipt could not be improved. The factory price was also quoted lower yesterday, but those who held the goods refused to sell, and there were virtually no transactions. Silk fabrics were mostly switched to cotton fabrics due to the high shipping costs and taxes for customer shipments, so demand was stagnant. Yesterday morning, brokers in the market were dissatisfied with direct transactions between their peers and started arguing, and everyone dispersed in a huff. There were no transactions for any goods. Transactions outside the market were priced similarly to the previous day.

### Artificial Silk Rationing: Payment on Monday

(Special report from this newspaper) The authorities have completed the investigation procedures for the rationing of artificial silk raw materials to silk weaving factories. The industry association held a meeting yesterday and decided that each weaving machine can be rationed about half a box of artificial silk. Payment will be made on Monday the 28th, and one-quarter of the goods will be delivered first. It is said that the price is about 10% lower than the market price.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Continue to Weaken

The rice market continued to digest slowly and retreated further. Northern japonica rice continued to weaken by 200-300 yuan, southern japonica rice weakened by another 300-400 yuan, glutinous rice weakened secretly by 400-500 yuan, and indica rice also followed down by 300-400 yuan. At the noon close, merchants showed slight interest, and the situation stabilized. Yellow soybeans were flat to weak, soybean cakes were weak to stable, flour gradually declined, down another hundred yuan or so, raw peanuts were nominally stable but secretly weak, and the liquor market was stable.

### Weak White Coal Blocks: Firewood and Charcoal Retail Sales Are Quite Strong

Coal market transactions turned dull, and the trend was generally stable. White coal screened lumps remained weak. Small-sized coal was still in short supply, and the market was the most popular. The rising trend of bituminous coal blocks gradually subsided, but sales continued. The firewood market was mixed, and arrivals continued from all directions, especially charcoal arrivals were the most abundant. Steel charcoal, screened charcoal, and pine firewood retail sales were quite strong, and prices remained stable. Poor-quality rush mat charcoal had to be selected and screened by the industry before it could be sold, and prices continued to fall.

### The North-South Dried Goods Market Trend Stabilizes

As the end of the major settlement period approached, most owners of North-South dried goods were unwilling to sell them again, so prices were higher, and the market trend was tight. Currently, only sporadic transactions are being made. Large-sized fragrant cinnamon bark from Xiangzhuang was offered at 38,700 yuan, while small and medium-sized grains were less than 30,000 yuan. Longan meat was as high as 90,000 yuan, and the next grade was 35,000 yuan. Jinshan longan branches were 92,000 yuan, large-bubble jujubes from Zhuangzhuang were 38,000 yuan, and the next grade was 36,000-37,000 yuan. Diaoqing sugar was 33,000 yuan, and red rice of the upper and middle grades from Zhuangzhuang was 35,000 yuan. The market trend was generally stable.

### Green Tea Sales Are the Strongest

Recently, as the Lunar New Year approaches, the transaction of red and green tea in this city has become increasingly prosperous, and sales have become more and more active. Buyers are searching more vigorously, and people's minds are also extremely excited. The trend is fully revealed, and green tea is particularly popular among them, so high prices have appeared one after another, and the market for red tea is tight and stable.

### Large Batch of Newspapers to Arrive: New Dodge Trucks to Enter the Market

(Report from this newspaper) According to sources in the foreign firms in this city, a large batch of rolled newspaper paper will arrive in Shanghai successively starting next month. By June of this year, it is expected to be sufficient to meet the needs of this city. Also, 1946 Dodge WF trucks will enter the market in large quantities before the end of April. The price is set at several thousand US dollars per vehicle, excluding customs duties, insurance, and other expenses (i.e., C.T.F.). Orders have already started. The price of rolled paper is set at less than US$150 per ton (2,000 pounds), also a C.T.F. price. Delivery will begin next month.

### Group A Football League: Exciting Showdown Today - Donghua Faces the Italian Overseas Team at 2:30 PM in Jiaozhou Park

Today's football league features an exciting Group A match between Donghua and the Italian Overseas team. These two major teams, one Chinese and one Western, are evenly matched and will provide an exciting game. The match will be held at Jiaozhou Park starting at 2:30 PM. Tickets are priced at 500 and 1,000 yuan.

Donghua and the Italian Overseas team have historically been considered two major rivals, one Chinese and one foreign, in the Shanghai football scene. Their matches always draw large crowds. Currently, Donghua is improving, further bolstered by the addition of four new players. Central defender Qian Shang has a fresh new look. Conversely, the Italian Overseas team has struggled to maintain stability due to lifestyle issues, and their training ground has been neglected for a long time, resulting in a decline in recent form. Therefore, Donghua's victory today will likely be less difficult than in the past. Ottone, the backbone of the Italian Overseas team, is the soul of the team. His recent departure to the north has further disrupted the team's coordination. It is reported that Sirati will take over as central defender, but this weakens the defense even further. Today's schedule is as follows: Donghua vs. Italian Overseas (Group A) 2:30 PM, Jiaozhou Park; Haihua vs. Wanguo (Group C1) 3:00 PM, Zhongyi; Bote vs. Lianxing (Group C2) 3:00 PM, Zhonger; Jianguang vs. Nie Zhongcheng (Group C1) 3:00 PM, Zhongsan.

Donghua Team: Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Linggen, Song Lingsheng, Xin Fuzhen, Han Longbo, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linhui, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang.

In case of rain today, please call 36701 or 38683 for inquiries.

### The Mask of "Politeness" and "Humility"

— Yu Ti

China is a land of propriety, a fact universally acknowledged. Therefore, all actions revolve around the concept of "propriety" as a starting point. In the minds of most people, "propriety" equates to politeness. Thus, you are polite, I am polite, everyone is polite.

Rushing to pay at restaurants, scrambling to buy tickets at theaters, fighting to pay taxi fares, even vying to purchase tram tickets... everyone is rushing and fighting, turning this land of propriety into a nation filled with hypocrisy. Is this kind of politeness propriety or impropriety? Everyone should search their own conscience.

Open your eyes and look at those with blonde hair and blue eyes. Do they engage in such foolishness? In principle, I am eating the food, so I should pay the price. I am enjoying the show, so I should pay. I am using the transportation, so I should pay... for everything I personally enjoy, I should pay. There is no such thing as "enjoying rights without fulfilling obligations." —Except perhaps in China.

Does this mean they lack "propriety" (politeness)? No, they are polite. You see them adhering to the principle of "women first" when boarding ships and disembarking from vehicles (an action that can be done by our fellow countrymen, but is rare). In train carriages, you see strong young people giving their seats to the elderly and frail... most notably, they are extremely polite to customers. When you finish buying something, they will say "Thank you," and even if you don't buy anything, they will still thank you. If it were a Chinese person, and you asked the price of this and that, they would impatiently roll their eyes at you. Why is this?

Now, let's shift the focus and talk about Chinese "humility."

As mentioned earlier, China is a land of propriety, so it inevitably possesses the virtue (?) of "humility." Opening your mouth, you say, "My abilities are weak, I cannot bear this important task..." Closing your mouth, you say, "My talents and learning are shallow..." a continuous stream of empty words. But the more humble a person is, the more society values and respects them. If you tell the truth, "I am qualified to handle this matter," before you can finish speaking, everyone around you will unanimously accuse you of being "arrogant" and "looking down on everything."...

If your superiors appoint you to handle a matter, or the public elects you to serve the country, you will submit resignation letters, one after another, stating "...my abilities are shallow... I fear I will fail to meet expectations..." In reality, you desire the position more than anything, but on the surface, you pretend to "retreat three times" and "feign ignorance."

In this new era, a new attitude should emerge. Those wearing the masks of "politeness and humility" should abandon them, because now is an era that demands "seeking truth from facts, and resolutely avoiding hypocritical slogans!"

Random Thoughts

### The Annoyance of Borrowing Books

— Su Yin

Since I was young, I have cherished things, unlike other children who like to destroy and discard things. I have always enjoyed tidying and preserving things. This is also due to the influence of my family environment, as my family members are mostly fond of cleanliness. Especially for books, the "Three Character Classic" and "Hundred Family Surnames" that I read when I was first learning to read have not a single torn page, and are still well-preserved to this day. As I grew older, my fondness for cleanliness deepened. A book could be read for two years without a single ink stain or a single dog-eared page. A dictionary could be used for over twenty years, and apart from being slightly old, it would still be intact, without a single broken or loose page. The magazines and newspapers I read were even more flat and clean, no different from the new books displayed in bookstores.

This is because I have a habit when reading: I never arbitrarily bend or force things. When turning pages, I don't use my middle and index fingers to clamp the pages, or use my thumbnails to lift the corners. Instead, I gently turn the pages with my thumbs. At the same time, I keep my hands and desk clean, so there are absolutely no oil stains or dirt on the books. Once I finish reading, I put the book away properly, without throwing or stuffing it anywhere.

But in recent years, my books can no longer maintain the cleanliness they once had. Because of changes in my environment, my books are no longer exclusive to me. Friends and relatives ask to borrow them, and I can't refuse them. I am also happy to let them read them, because I want others to gain knowledge, inspiration, and enjoyment from those books.

Unfortunately, when the books are returned, they are completely different from when they were borrowed. They were originally flat and smooth, but now they are covered with creases and wrinkles. They were originally clean, but now they are stained with oil and dirt. Sometimes there are even watermelon seeds or sunflower seed shells stuck between the pages. Worse still, the book has fallen apart, with the cover and spine barely hanging on. Seeing this, I can't help but feel a surge of anger. But to them, unless the book itself is torn, they don't think it's a big deal at all. Even if the book is torn, they will give you an apologetic smile, blaming it on naughty children or terrible mice. Not only can you not scold them, but you also have to return their smile. Moreover, although my anger is great, my courage is small. I simply don't have the courage to scold them. Once, a colleague asked to borrow a novel. Fearing that it would end up in a "burnt and battered" state again, I told her in advance: "Don't damage the book." But she retorted sullenly: "I'm not a child. My husband is a teacher!" From then on, I dared not say another word, either before or after.

If the book is ruined, although I no longer have the desire to preserve it, it's no big deal if I tear it up to start a fire or sell it by the pound as waste paper. The problem is when a book borrowed from someone else is ruined, I have to take responsibility. Because of this, if possible, I often try to keep borrowed books out of sight. But I also feel that this is too selfish, hindering the spread of knowledge. At the same time, I also feel that it is my responsibility to maintain the integrity of the book.

So I am annoyed—a not-so-big, not-so-small annoyance. Should I change my habit of cleanliness and use reason to suppress my rising anger? When encountering a book borrowed from someone else, should I lend it to others to take advantage of the opportunity to spread knowledge, or should I not lend it to others in order to fulfill my responsibility to maintain the book's original integrity?

I believe that my habit of cleanliness is good and correct. If everyone had my habit, bookstore owners might frown, but library directors would rejoice. The lifespan of books in their libraries would be extended at least tenfold, which would increase the effectiveness of each book and save the library countless amounts of money, as well as the effort and materials for repairing and binding. I believe this habit is what every citizen should have. Not being fond of cleanliness is a bad habit and a disease of our people. Whether it's the individual, the family, or society, we see disorder, messiness, and chaos everywhere. This is an important reason why foreigners look down on us. I should not only not abandon my habit to conform to others, but I should also take on the responsibility of correcting others' bad habits. But how do I correct them? I don't have the courage to point fingers directly, nor do I have the eloquence to persuade them tactfully. To exchange someone's resentment for the cleanliness of a book seems to be making a mountain out of a molehill and not worth it. Because there are few people who will admit their mistakes, and even fewer who will accept your teachings and correct their habits. Then why bother doing something futile?

Thus, I am often disturbed by the contradictions between my habits, sense of responsibility, and fear, and I feel a not-so-big, not-so-small annoyance!

Short Essay

### Lost Warmth

— Zhang Peng

My adopted son, Zhang Yao, came to see me on Sunday. In an unintentional observation, I noticed the pair of blue cloth shoes he was wearing, and a kind of shadow flickered in my heart, and an idea swirled in my mind. 'Could these shoes have been made by his mother for him to wear?' I was sure my guess was right, but I still asked him: 'Yao, did your mom make the new shoes you're wearing?'

"Yes, Mom made them for me."

'Yao, you have to wear them carefully, don't waste them carelessly,' How I envied him; I envied him for having a mother who made shoes for him. 'Ah! Mother, the warmth and kindness of a mother's love, how deep and how intense!' My eyes felt hot, as if tears were about to fall.

Thinking of the past, I also had a mother. My mother also made many cloth shoes for me to wear, but I always wore a long face, still complaining that the shoes were not made well enough; that the style didn't match the beauty I imagined. I would pout and argue with my mom: 'Mom, the shoes you made aren't good looking at all, how can I wear them out in public?'

'Good boy, the shoes are already made. If you want to wear nice shoes, Mom will make you another pair next time!' Mom still patiently and gently endured my anger: 'The style of these shoes isn't that bad, you can wear them for now.'

'No; no, I don't want to wear those embarrassing shoes!' I puffed up my cheeks and threw the shoes hard on the table, turning around and running away: 'I don't care for shoes like these, I'd rather go barefoot!'

Mom was a gentle and weak woman, she loved my father, and she also loved her children. At the time, seeing me so angry with tears in my eyes, she didn't get angry and scold me, but quietly used a handkerchief to wipe her eyes. I knew that Mom's heart was hurt, I knew that Mom was crying. My heart was so cruel, only wishing to be angry myself, without any love or pity for Mom's pain. I locked myself in my room like a fool, muttering to myself what I thought were very satisfying words.

My attitude, my angry attitude, made Mom very unhappy for several days.

Now I have no mother; I have become a person who has lost warmth. No one makes shoes for me to wear anymore. If I want to wear shoes, I have to buy expensive shoes to wear. Thinking of the past, and then thinking of the present, I couldn't help but quietly grieve with tears streaming down my face.

What makes me regret it for the rest of my life is, why didn't I keep a pair of worn-out old shoes? Not only could I keep them as a permanent memento for myself, but when I saw others wearing shoes made by their mothers, I could also take out my broken and worn shoes from when I was little to look at them and reminisce about the love and kindness my mother showed me in the past. It's hateful and regrettable that I can't even get that. Alas! Where can I find traces of the warmth that my mother left me?

### Theorem

— Cheng Lieshui

Waiting for a tram is the most unpleasant thing, but when you finally catch the tram, you feel very happy.

Being able to squeeze on feels lucky; but once you're on, you're so crushed that you can barely breathe, and you still feel frustrated.

People often have this kind of psychology, and things often happen this way.

Adults tease children with candy. The child happily wants it, but the adult won't give it. When the child doesn't want it anymore, the adult keeps teasing.

As a result, the child doesn't get the candy; cries, makes a fuss, and even gets a beating.

Children are always like this, and adults are always like this.

Mice specialize in gnawing on things. When they are caught, they are released because there are no cats.

But the second time they gnaw again, and are caught again, but because there are still no cats, they are released again.

Mice are able to constantly erode things because of the safety of not having cats.

### Poor and Sick Young Man Suffers Unspeakable Hardship - Asks Philanthropists to Send Him to Hospital for Treatment

Dear Editor:

Liu Sangnian, barely twenty years old, unfortunately contracted mild tuberculosis in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). For the past three years, he has been unable to afford treatment, and his savings have been exhausted. Filled with worry and anxiety, he hates his illness and the pain of not receiving treatment.

With tearful voice, I eagerly await your reply! Respectfully submitted. Liu Sang bows.

Therefore, we are disclosing his situation in the hope that benevolent individuals or hospital owners, moved by his talent, will provide medical assistance. The merits would be immeasurable. Please contact this newspaper if you are willing to provide medical assistance, and the good deeds will be immeasurable.

### Responses to Readers

(I) New Invention Patent Rights
Mr. Editor: My friend has recently invented a very useful tool for rural irrigation and intends to apply to the authorities for a patent. I respectfully ask the following points: (1) Can the inventor obtain a patent from the government? To which agency should the application be submitted to be legal? (2) What is the longest and shortest term for a patent? (3) What are the application procedures? (4) Can an application be submitted before the National Government returns to the capital? Reader: Chen Yunian

(Answer) I greatly admire your talent in inventing an irrigation tool for rural construction. Regarding patent rights, you should apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Patents have a prescribed term limit. An application can be submitted before the National Government returns to the capital. You can entrust a lawyer to handle the procedures.

(II) What Punishment Should Traitors Receive?
Mr. Editor: Since the victory of the War of Resistance, many traitors and puppets have been arrested in various places, but many have also escaped justice, which is a great regret! I respectfully report to you the situation of my personal oppression by traitors: In June of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], I was bullied by the puppet company commander Zhang Ni Zicheng, who took advantage of his power to arrest me for no reason, subjecting me to cruel torture and beatings, leaving me half-dead, and my body naturally covered with wounds, making my suffering unspeakable. I was imprisoned like this for three days, tortured hundreds of times. When I regained consciousness, my mind was dazed, like a madman, and I did not know what I was saying. (Omission) Now that the light of day has returned, Zhang Ni, due to his overflowing wickedness, was arrested by the Provincial Security Team on the 6th of this month and sent to the county for legal action. May I ask if the traitor should be sentenced to death? I hope it can be published in the social service column so that I can appeal to all sectors of society. Mu Lin

(Answer) Since the traitor has already been sent to the county for legal action, you can collect evidence of his past treacherous acts and crimes, along with the details of your victimization, and submit them to the county for reference. There is no need to appeal to all sectors of society again. As for whether he should be sentenced to death, it depends entirely on the nature of his crimes and is not appropriate to speculate.

(III) Application Procedures for Scholarship Recipients
I have heard that your newspaper's scholarship funds have been merged into the Education Loan Committee. Must old scholarship recipients reapply to the Education Loan Committee, or will they still be handled in the same way as before? I respectfully ask for a reply. Scholarship recipient Cheng Linsun

(Answer) From February 1st, university and middle school students should directly collect application forms from the Education Loan Committee, while primary school students should obtain forms from the principal of their school.

(IV) The Authority of Various Government Agencies
Mr. Editor: To be sure of the authority of the various military and political agencies, in addition to managing local public security, does the Songhu Garrison Headquarters have the authority to mediate labor disputes? If there are acts of overreach, what means do citizens have to prevent them? I have always considered your newspaper to be the mouthpiece of the people, so please answer this and I wish you peace! A Citizen, January 24th

(Answer) Mediating labor disputes is the responsibility of the Bureau of Social Affairs; however, if there are circumstances that endanger public security, the Garrison Headquarters is responsible for maintaining local order and cannot shirk its duty. The question of "what means to prevent it" is, in my humble opinion, untenable.
