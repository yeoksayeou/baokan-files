### Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Suddenly Attack Taixing; National Army Rushes to Reinforce and Contain Them; Communist Side Continues to Breach Dikes to Salvage a Desperate Situation

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 26th] According to an urgent report from Yangzhou at 9:30 PM tonight: There has been a significant change in the Northern Jiangsu war situation today. To salvage the deteriorating situation in Shaobo, the Communist forces suddenly launched a fierce offensive north of Taixing. The focus of the war has shifted from left to right. Three regiments of Communist troops launched a surprise attack on Huangqiao and Danjingzhen yesterday. The National Army's forces in the area were weak, and the situation in the two Taixing areas was extremely tense for a time. After fierce fighting until noon today, the National Army reinforcements arrived and contained the Communist offensive. However, the Communist forces have a large number of follow-up troops and plan to continue to attack the two Taixing areas, further threatening Yangtze River traffic.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 26th] According to a phone call from the Xiannvmiao front line at 8:00 PM tonight, since the National Army entered Dawangmiao along the Grand Canal line, the morale of the Communist forces has greatly declined. They even breached the Grand Canal dike at the Liuwufang Hotel south of Shaobo. The Chaiba area has been flooded, and the breach is more than two feet wide. Fortunately, the Grand Canal water level has been low recently, otherwise a major flood would have occurred. Furthermore, the National Army braved a hail of bullets this morning to forcibly cross the Shajiangba pontoon bridge on the Xianshao Highway. The first and second lines of Communist defenses in Shaobo are extremely strong. In addition, the area is surrounded by water on three sides, forming a natural defensive position for us. As of the time of this dispatch, both sides are engaged in heavy shelling in Shaobo Town.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian, 26th] Since the recapture of Qiaoshu on the western front, the Communist forces entrenched in Dinggou, Shaobo, have shown signs of wavering. The National Army is now approaching the outskirts of Shaobo, engaging in fierce fighting with the Communist forces. The 12th Regiment of the Communist forces near Rugao to the west has been suppressed by our troops moving north from Nantong in continuous suppression operations. Seven regiments have been routed, two regiments have surrendered, and the remaining three regiments have retreated north. The 24th Regiment of Communist forces in the Jialifenjie area southwest of Rugao has also been routed. In addition, more than 20,000 Communist troops with Japanese-style equipment have been transferred from Yancheng to Dongtai, but their intentions are unclear.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 26th] According to official sources, the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu have been silent for a long time after their defeat in Rugao. Recently, on the 24th of this month, they suddenly gathered a mob of about seven regiments and attempted a pincer movement on Baipu. Commander Liu, the garrison commander in the area, keenly learned of the situation and immediately led part of his troops in a counterattack. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting under heavy artillery fire for two days and nights. Until 4:00 PM on the 25th, the Communist forces were unable to hold out and fled in disarray. We captured a large number of prisoners.

[Central News Agency, Jiangdu, 26th] Military news indicates that the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu are continuing to dig dikes to offset their military setbacks. According to a recent survey, the situation in the flooded areas is as follows: (1) Eight breaches have been dug in the dikes of the branch rivers of the Wanbei Canal, flooding the northeast area. (2) The road southeast of Zhaodun has been destroyed by the Communist forces, and fortifications have been built on the dikes of the small rivers. A large breach, 1,400 meters long, has been dug in the river dike southeast of Zhaodun, flooding many villages. Further south, five breaches have been dug in the small river dikes, and a large breach has been dug in the small dike at the Sancha River estuary. (3) The flooding is severe along the city river south of Pixian to the Liujiadu crossing. (4) Six breaches have been dug in the dikes along the river north of Donghai City, and the floodwaters are rushing from east to south, turning the fields into a vast expanse of water, causing severe flooding. (5) In the Yinfanghang Shayuba area in the western Yanhai River area of Guanyun, the Communist forces have dug 22 breaches. The water is rushing, deep, and voluminous, submerging trees and houses.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] The military recently seized Communist documents, including a diary of a Communist cadre, stating that they were ordered to concentrate in Southern Shandong to support the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu to carry out a protracted war, and were prepared to break into small groups to carry out a comprehensive destruction of transportation if necessary.

### Comforting the Soldiers in Northern Jiangsu; Eagerly Distributing This Newspaper for Reading

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Playing Chess with Mrs. Marshall in Lushan

### Communist Party's Statement on the Current Situation; Zhou Enlai Formally Issues It in Nanjing Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Communist Party delegation hosted a reception for the press community at 3:30 PM on the 26th, presided over by Zhou Enlai. At the reception, they distributed a summary of the Xinhua News Agency's "Masses" Weekly editorial "Immediately and Unconditionally Ceasefire and Implement the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference" as the Communist Party's formal statement on the current situation. The statement stated: An article was published in the "Masses" published in Shanghai on August 25, targeting Chairman Chiang's August 14 message, entitled "Immediately and Unconditionally Ceasefire and Implement the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference." We believe that Chairman Chiang's message "not only failed to change this situation, but also worsened it," "because the ceasefire conditions he proposed were that the Communist troops withdraw from many areas and the local elected governments be abolished, and that the one-party government of the Kuomintang take over." The editorial pointed out how the government authorities overturned the ceasefire, the PCC's military reorganization and other agreements, such as "after the announcement of the January ceasefire agreement, the government side never implemented the ceasefire in the Northeast, did not accept General Marshall's proposal and the Communist Party's immediate endorsement of sending an Executive Headquarters group to the Northeast. Later, although there was an agreement on March 27 to allow the dispatch of a group to the Northeast, the government side then violated the agreement, refused to cease fire, and fought fiercely in the Northeast. Until the June truce, the offensive in the Northeast slightly eased, but the offensive within Shanhaiguan spread throughout the north and south of the Yellow River. The Kuomintang government has so far occupied 59 county towns and more than 3,000 villages in our liberated areas."

In the June ceasefire negotiations, in order to strive to achieve the desire for peace, the Communist Party has not hesitated to make major concessions in the supplementary agreements on the ceasefire in the Northeast, the restoration of transportation, and military reorganization. "However, during the negotiations, the government authorities unreasonably raised the issue of the final decision by the American side... when the agreement was about to be reached, the government suddenly demanded that the Communist troops and local elected governments must withdraw from Northern Jiangsu, the Jiaoji Railway line, the area south of Chengde in Rehe, and Andong. Otherwise, the four agreements cannot be signed, and a ceasefire will be difficult to achieve." The Communist Party "believes that the troop stations for the implementation of the military reorganization plan must not be confused with local administration, and the issue of local power has been clearly stipulated in the appendix to the PCC program, so it firmly rejects this demand that exceeds the items of the ceasefire negotiations." At the beginning of August, the five demands raised by the government authorities through Ambassador Stuart became more and more numerous, and the authorities regarded the current "demands as a prerequisite for a comprehensive ceasefire and negotiations on government reorganization." "The government not only broke the agreements on the ceasefire, military reorganization, and restoration of transportation, but also overturned the five resolutions of the PCC and Chairman Chiang's four promises." For example, regarding the reorganization of the government, "the government has always failed to agree on the number of committee members and the one-third veto power according to the resolution, and violated the resolution to select these committee members from other parties and non-party members on the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee." Also, "regarding the resolutions of the National Assembly, first, because the government had not been reorganized and the draft constitution had not been deliberated, all parties were inconvenient to submit a list of representatives. Later, because the government side proposed to increase the number of representatives, the proportion of representatives was not agreed upon. As the fifth and fifth terms approached, the PCC Synthesis Group, under the convening of Chairman Chiang, decided to postpone the National Assembly and explained that the date of the meeting would be determined after all matters had been agreed upon. Unexpectedly, on July 3, the government unilaterally announced that the National Assembly would be convened on November 12 of this year, without consultation with the PCC, and the resolutions of the PCC were swept away."

The editorial pointed out that "one of the main reasons why the Kuomintang dared to overturn the PCC is because the United States government gives them help in any situation." The editorial then pointed out that General Marshall cannot but bear considerable responsibility on this issue. However, General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart's efforts are not impossible to succeed."

The editorial finally analyzed the sixth guideline proposed in Chairman Chiang's message, pointing out that the aforementioned five demands were the center of it. "The center is that the war cannot be stopped unless the Communist Party withdraws from certain areas." The editorial clearly stated that "it is even more impossible for the PCC to handle matters such as agreeing on the representatives of the National Assembly and appointing various committees with the participation of people from all parties."

### Special Envoy Marshall Returns to Nanjing Today; Remains Optimistic about the Prospects for Peace Talks; Ministry of Civil Affairs Has Not Received Recommendations on Reconvening the PCC

[Special Dispatch from Guling, 26th] Special Envoy Marshall is scheduled to leave Guling and return to Nanjing on the 27th. In the past two days, Marshall has maintained frequent contact with Ambassador Stuart in Nanjing. Marshall is able to spend his time leisurely and remains very optimistic about the prospects for talks.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] News from Guling today stated that Special Envoy Marshall is currently drafting a new plan to form a five-member committee composed of two representatives from the National and Communist sides and one representative from the American side to resume peace talks on the basis of government reorganization. Reports here that the American representative of the committee will be Ambassador Stuart have not been confirmed by official sources.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 26th] There was no contact in the capital's political negotiations on the 26th, and Ambassador Stuart had no activities. In the evening, he was invited by Kong Xiangxi, a trustee of Yenching University, to Kong's residence for dinner and continued to discuss Yenching University affairs.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 26th] After the news that a talk was held in Guling was proven to be untrue, Zeng Qi, Chu Fucheng, and others first requested that the Political Participation Conference be convened ahead of schedule, and then the Democratic League requested that the PCC or the PCC Synthesis Group meeting be reconvened. The reporter recently asked Wu, the Chief of Civil Affairs of the National Government, about his opinion on this matter. He stated that, according to common sense, since the term of the current Political Participation Conference has been extended for half a year, a general meeting should be convened once before the National Assembly is convened. The time of the meeting will be determined by the Chairman. As for the PCC and its Synthesis Group meetings, they are not statutory permanent deliberative bodies, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs has not received any recommendations for the Democratic League's proposal to reconvene them.

### Electrification of National Defense Education Movement; Chairman Orders Efforts to Promote It; China Film Studio Reorganized into Military Education Film Studio

[Central News Agency, Guling, 26th] The national defense education movement for the popularization of electrification, which Minister Bai suggested to reporters in Guling, is now known to have been recommended by Marshal Marshall. Recently, when Marshal Marshall met with Minister Bai and Chief of Staff Chen in Nanjing and Guling, he introduced the achievements of the United States in using electrified education to mobilize 12 million civilians with no military knowledge to train them into brave and skilled troops in the shortest possible time during the World War II to Bai and Chen. It is reported that after the China Film Studio is reorganized into a military education film studio, Luo Jingyu, who has just returned from the United States to study film, will be the director, and a large number of military education films will be produced as teaching materials to promote the popularization and universalization of national defense education.

### The Murderer of Zhang Xinfu, Mo Guangcheng, Confesses the Process; The Whole Incident Was a Premeditated Conspiracy by the Communist Army; The Truth is Revealed

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 25th] Mo Guangcheng, the main culprit in the murder of Zhang Xinfu, which shocked both inside and outside Shanhaiguan, was arrested in Huludao in early July. After being transferred through the 93rd Army, the First Army Group Headquarters of Jie Jin, he was transferred to Shenyang on the 19th of this month. After interrogation by the military law office of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, Mo confessed that the assassination of Zhang Xinfu was a premeditated conspiracy by the Communist Party. At that time, he was under the command of the 8th Brigade Headquarters of the Liaodong Military Region. On the day Zhang was killed, Liu Ziyi, the deputy commander of the Communist Security Brigade, was also at the Lishizhai Railway Station. Mo is from Xiagezhuang, Tiezhen Town, Zunhua County. According to his confession, he has five brothers, all of whom joined the Eighth Route Army. He is the youngest, and his four older brothers all died in the anti-Japanese war. When the Communist Army entered Shanhaiguan, he was a platoon leader in the Second Company of the First Battalion of the 12th Regiment. During the reorganization in Jinzhou, he was reorganized into the Seventh Company of the Third Battalion of the 23rd Regiment, serving as the deputy company commander and acting company commander.

### Entire Confession

The criminal Mo continued to confess that when Zhang was killed, I was stationed at Li Shizhai, and I received an order from the 8th Brigade Headquarters stating that the train carrying the takeover personnel had already passed. If it returned towards Shenyang, it must be detained, and everyone on board must be arrested; otherwise, military law would be applied. At that time, the head of the security group was running around to various stations all day for this matter, and I barely slept. One day (I forgot the date), I suddenly received a phone call saying that the train would be returning to Shenyang, ordering me not to arrest Zhang Xinfu and others for the time being, and to wait until Shenjingzi before taking action. At about 9 PM that day, the deputy commander of the Security Brigade, Liu Ziyi, arrived at Li Shizhai Station. I had gone to the battalion headquarters on business. Deputy Commander Liu said to Chen Guidong, the platoon leader stationed at the station, that the train taking over the Fushun coal mine was about to return, with a certain Guo political commissar who had connections with the Eighth Route Army and a Soviet major (whose name I didn't know), along with several Soviet soldiers. He ordered Platoon Leader Chen to arrest all the people on the train. When I returned from the battalion headquarters, Zhang Xinfu and his eight attendants had already been tied up at the station, their overcoats had been taken off, and they were only wearing plain clothes. At that time, the Soviet soldiers had already slipped away on the train, completely shirking their responsibility to protect Zhang Xinfu. Later, Deputy Commander Liu ordered me to take Zhang Xinfu and the others to the wilderness. The political commissar Guo gave me the same order, also saying that Zhang Xinfu was a major traitor. Because they were not my direct superiors, and I wasn't sure if the order was authentic, I couldn't be responsible if I was investigated later, so I refused to carry it out. Deputy Commander Liu then sent two guards to force me to kill Zhang Xinfu. Under duress, I had to take Zhang Xinfu and the others to the south hillside and order my soldiers to kill them with bayonets. Zhang Xinfu didn't say a word before his death, acting as if nothing was happening, but his attitude was tough. His attendants, however, were like pathetic worms, begging not to be killed, but they were all killed. That was around 10 PM that night. The next day, Deputy Commander Liu called me to the Fushun Command Headquarters, asking what I thought. I said nothing, because I was ordered by my direct superior, I was afraid of unexpected consequences. He said that it was absolutely nothing to do with me, and that he would take full responsibility. About ten days later, the Soviet commander also summoned me to their headquarters, asking if any Soviet soldiers had participated in or sympathized with the execution of Zhang and the others. I said that there were Soviet soldiers on the train, but they did not participate in the execution, but they probably sympathized. I also said that this matter was entirely the idea of the Security Commander Liu Ziyi and the Political Commissar Guo. Later, the troops set off, and I was detained by the Soviet army for more than forty days. The Soviet commander returned to Shenyang from Changchun and then released me. By that time, the troops had already gone to Liaoyang, where we started fighting the Central Army. We were ordered to retreat to Changchun, and then to Dahushan for rest. At that time, I took ten men and deserted, intending to surrender to the National Army. We clashed with the Eighth Route Army on the way and were scattered. I planned to go home, but I knew there were still Eighth Route Army soldiers in my hometown, so I changed my plans and engaged in small business in Huludao. The capital was 50,000 national currency from selling a watch. I bought and sold cigarettes and stored them at Zhao Peiyun's house in Daochi, where I also lived. I was arrested after living there for more than ten days. An officer often bought cigarettes from me in plain clothes, and I later learned that he was an officer from the regimental headquarters of the garrison troops, and so on. In summary, Mo's confession is sufficient to prove the Communist army's conspiracy and the international significance of the case. The truth of the Zhang Xinfu murder case is now clear.

### U.S. Surplus Materials in Shanghai Confirmed to Be Illegally Sold; McB Claims to Be Investigating

[United Press Dispatch from this city] According to authoritative sources: the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Administration illegally disposed of materials, causing U.S. taxpayers to lose nearly millions of dollars. An order has been issued to investigate thoroughly. The scope of the investigation is said to include the following: (1) Selling perfectly usable airplanes worth millions of dollars to the Central Airlines for 50,000 dollars; (2) Reclassifying surplus aircraft parts and equipment transferred by the U.S. Air Force, marked as "new," "intact," and "largely intact," and marking them as "clearance sale," selling items originally worth hundreds of thousands of dollars for only a few thousand dollars; (3) Canceling a contract originally signed with an American trading company, and then reselling it to the Chinese side, the sales price and part of the American firm's price. This same material was then resold by the purchaser to the American company at a high price; (4) The Shanghai office disregarded the regulations on priority purchase rights when selling surplus materials; (5) Handing over ships and other equipment worth millions of dollars to the Chinese side without signing a contract or agreeing on a price (some of these ships are now said to have been rejected by the Chinese side, who spent huge sums on repairs and demanded compensation from the United States). It is said that investigators are also interested in the lifestyles of some Disposal Administration officials, some of whom have extremely luxurious private residences, and at least one of whom currently lives in one of Shanghai's most luxurious residences, which is owned by a major customer who purchases foreign Disposal Administration materials.

At the same time, some Disposal Administration officials are accused of violating regulations by engaging in concurrent jobs with Chinese official or commercial organizations, and this matter is also under investigation. It is also learned that internal disputes have repeatedly arisen within the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Disposal Administration because Inspector McKenna believed that some contracts were questionable. Mr. McKenna even resigned in anger to protest the Disposal Administration's work in China. A formal investigation into the current situation of the Shanghai office will begin as soon as Inspector Maddy arrives here from Washington. Mr. Maddy was specially dispatched by the headquarters after reports of illegal corruption reached Washington.

The authoritative source also said: So far, the investigation has hardly officially begun. It has now been suggested that if this investigation cannot quickly achieve a satisfactory result locally, the Senate Maytag Committee or the U.S. Department of Justice may intervene, as the inside story of the case is complicated and involves army, navy, and civilian personnel.

[Another Dispatch] Mr. McB, head of the U.S. Foreign Materials Disposal Administration, who is currently conducting an investigation in Shanghai, has confirmed the United Press report after seeing it. He issued a statement yesterday, stating: "The case of the alleged illegal sale of U.S. surplus materials in Shanghai is indeed under investigation." According to McB, the complaint reached his Washington office on July 24, and he immediately sent an inspector to Shanghai for a detailed investigation. After McB arrived in Shanghai, the director of the Shanghai office, Johnson, requested that the U.S. military headquarters investigate at the same time, which is also underway. McB stated: "An appropriate statement will be issued after the investigation is completed." He also said that it is the Disposal Administration's consistent policy to quickly investigate any illegal cases.

### Materials Worth 4 Billion; The Quartermaster General of the Sixth War Area Disposed of Them Without Authorization; The Wuhan Investigation Team Has Raised Questions

[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 25th] Regarding the received materials retained by the former Quartermaster General Headquarters of the Sixth War Area, after the investigation team raised questions with the headquarters and reviewed relevant documents, it was deemed a great regret that materials worth more than 400,000 were disposed of by the headquarters without authorization. The investigation process was released tonight, publicly condemning it, with rather stern wording. Here are the main points in summary: A. The retention and distribution of these materials were not submitted to the central government for approval in advance, but only reported to the Ministry of Military Administration for record after the fact. B. The more than 140 types of materials distributed were not only large in quantity but also mostly non-military items. C. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Military Administration not only did not approve it but also gently condemned it as exceeding the scope of reception and instructed that the materials should be sold by the Ministry of Economic Affairs through public auction. D. After the Chief Executive Headquarters was denied the request by the Ministry of Military Administration, it continued to retain and distribute the materials. E. The circumstances of this case are serious, and it has been decided to immediately submit it to the central government for instructions on how to handle it. Furthermore, the number of distributed items and the number of recipients do not match.

[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 26th] The investigation team announced that the largest quantity of retained materials in the Sixth War Area were silk and wool fabrics, etc., totaling more than 140 types. More than half of them were received by the former Chief Executive Headquarters of the Sixth War Area, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, and the Quartermaster General Headquarters of the Sixth War Area, etc. The total number of people was only over 2,600, with each person receiving an average of over one million yuan in value. The investigation team's final conclusion stated: With such illegal procedures, mobilizing so many materials, those responsible for reviewing and distributing them cannot shirk their major responsibility. If it is said that it was to avoid material spoilage, then it is found that most of the types are non-perishable. If it is said that it was due to urgent needs, then each agency and troop already had formal budgets and supplies. If it is said that the recipient units have contributed to the country and should be rewarded, it must also be planned by the government as a whole, and rewards cannot be given from below, allowing a few people to obtain such a large amount of illegal income. Furthermore, as the enemy has devoured our flesh and blood, how can we learn from the pain and strive to return every bit to the public to increase national strength and relieve the suffering of the people?

### Director Arrested for Reception Fraud; Zhang Xiaochun Detained

[Central News Agency Dispatch on the 26th] The reception investigation team announced a confirmed reception fraud case on the 26th. One of the corrupt officials is Zhang Xiaochun, acting director of the Transportation Office of the Tianjin Public Utilities Bureau. He was previously the chief of the general affairs section of the reception committee of the former Tianjin Transportation Co., Ltd. It is learned that other personnel are also involved. The investigation team received a tip that Zhang and others had committed fraud amounting to 200 million yuan. On the 26th, they went to Zhang's office to investigate and requested to see the original register from the time of reception. Zhang then submitted a register filled with alterations, with items listed as having been reduced in quantity. The alterations were stamped with the seal of the Japanese Miyamoto. Huang Yuren, a member of the investigation team, then discovered a copy of the register in his drawer that had no alterations. He then discovered a wooden Miyamoto seal, which confirmed that Zhang had submitted a falsified register. The Tianjin District Prosecutor of the Court then arrested Zhang and escorted him to the court, where he was immediately prosecuted.

### Local Communications; Provincial Chairman of Jiangsu Issues Order to Do Everything Possible to Stabilize Prices

[Our Zhenjiang Communication] Following the government's adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province, fearing that people in society would misunderstand the reasons and cause price fluctuations, summoned representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors of the province on the 20th of this month to explain the government's intentions. On the 24th, he also issued an order to the county magistrates of each county, instructing them to quickly convene the chambers of commerce and trade associations of their respective counties to give earnest guidance, and to work with party and group organizations to do everything possible to stabilize prices. The telegram stated briefly: "The government's adjustment of the foreign exchange rate is an appropriate measure to balance exports and imports, support production, stabilize prices, and promote the national economy, and is not related to domestic prices. This year, there has been a bumper harvest in various places, unprecedented in decades. Grain prices have already shown a downward trend, and other prices should not take the opportunity to rise. Industrial and commercial figures in various counties, either due to lack of information or insufficient understanding, may not fully understand this exchange rate adjustment, resulting in doubts, hesitations, and price increases. County magistrates should be responsible for explaining and guiding them, quickly convening the chambers of commerce and trade associations of their respective counties to provide earnest guidance, and working with party, group, and public opinion institutions to stabilize prices."

### Hangzhou City Council; Second Congress Opens

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 26th] The Second Congress of the Hangzhou City Council opened yesterday morning. Speaker Luo Yun requested leave due to illness, and Deputy Speaker Xu Di presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, stating: Today, Hangzhou has presented a tragic scene of external weakness and internal exhaustion. Factories and shops have closed down, schools cannot be restored, the sick have no way to receive medical treatment, and the poor have nothing to eat. Only West Lake and a few roads are not worth mentioning, so it is not appropriate to regard the increase in financial revenue as a political achievement. We should have the spirit of helping those who are drowning and feeding those who are hungry, earnestly relieve the poor and sick, develop agricultural and industrial production, maintain legitimate commerce, improve education, and strengthen the Baojia system. I hope that the municipal government will display a spirit of revolutionary sacrifice and unleash administrative efficiency. Following this, Zhang Qiang, chairman of the Provincial Party Department, spoke about local autonomy. Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, reported on the work guidelines of the various departments on behalf of the provincial government and expressed three hopes: (1) Government organizations are complex, but all citizens, whether central or local, can review and make suggestions. (2) Municipal administration should focus on construction. (3) The government and the City Council are both established for the people, and the two are one, so I hope that there will be more speeches. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian then stated: "Responsible, open cooperation" will be the administrative attitude for the future. In the afternoon, Secretary-General Xu Fusan reported on council affairs, passed the rules for citizen attendance, and delivered a declaration, elaborating on five key points: (1) Revitalizing the atmosphere, (2) Practicing the rule of law, (3) Venerating science, (4) Improving people's livelihoods, (5) Promoting construction. Mayor Zhou then reported on municipal administration.

Editorial

### After the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Issued a Statement

The conflict between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, as of yesterday, has become even more confusing due to the CCP's statement!

Since Marshal Ma [Marshall] and Ambassador Stuart jointly issued a statement on the 10th of this month, issuing a serious warning, the negotiations have reached a final stage, and conflicts in various regions have intensified. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, adhering to his original intention of peace, issued a letter to the people of the whole country on the 14th, outlining six political solutions, which were not only supported by the people of the whole country but also received good comments from friendly nations. Unexpectedly, the CCP considered Chairman Chiang's message as a sign that the government was "preparing for a military offensive," so Yan'an issued a mobilization order and publicly declared the existence of a state of war. At the same time, it intensified its siege of Datong militarily, and the great battle in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway broke out as a result.

However, the CCP also knows that the people cannot be completely deceived, so it changed its tune orally, saying that the issuance of the mobilization order was not a declaration of war. At the same time, it announced that the Central Government would also issue a statement to respond to Chairman Chiang's proclamation. However, its statement was repeatedly revised, and it was not issued in Nanjing until 3:00 PM yesterday. Although we have been waiting for this statement for a long time, and we thought it might add some decisive factors to the future development of the situation, after reading it, we still feel that the CCP only has clever tactics but no real sincerity in seeking peace, which makes us even more lost.

The CCP's statement still sings its old tune of "immediate and unconditional ceasefire," but let us ask, who issued the mobilization order? And look at whose troops are besieging Datong? The ironclad facts cannot be denied. In the past year, who has been attacking in the overall situation of China? Who was forced to defend? Who wants war? Who desires peace? The Chinese people see it very clearly, and there is no need to engage in more propaganda warfare or nerve warfare. I remember when the CCP occupied Changchun and advanced into Harbin in the Northeast, they were also shouting the slogan of unconditional ceasefire. Such inconsistent words and deeds have happened more than once!

As for "implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC)," it is even more ridiculous. The government originally had the determination to implement the PCC resolutions. If it were not for the CCP's breach of faith, these agreements would have been implemented long ago. Moreover, in fact, the government has been implementing the reorganization, demobilization, and retirement of the national army step by step, which was also acknowledged by the U.S. mediator, Special Envoy Marshall. However, on the CCP's side, not only did it not fulfill the basic plan of unified reorganization, but it also recruited troops and horses everywhere and desperately expanded its army. What kind of unification is this? As for the reorganization of the government, the government repeatedly invited the CCP to submit a list of names in March and April, but the CCP deliberately procrastinated. The CCP also failed to nominate representatives as agreed for the convening of the National Assembly, and instead launched a major war in the Northeast. Even Special Envoy Marshall repeatedly requested that "the CCP withdraw from Changchun before discussing other issues," but the CCP consistently turned a deaf ear and refused to accept it, so the Central Government had no choice but to use force to recover Changchun. However, the Central Government still ordered a ceasefire in June to await consultations, but so far there have been no results.

Standing from the people's perspective, we once again call on both the KMT and the CCP: the people's livelihood is exhausted, and it is now worse than ever. What is needed now is to live in peace and work happily. The CCP, for the sake of cherishing its own future, should accept the public will of the people, pull back from the precipice, and not be the leader of internal chaos. ...

Since the CCP says it wants an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and the implementation of the PCC resolutions, it should be consistent in word and deed, immediately lay down its weapons, and resume peace talks with the government to discuss a practical and effective method for implementing the two principles of "political democratization" and "nationalization of the army" simultaneously. During this period, in order to show its impartiality and do its best, the government should also automatically expand the foundation of the government, strive for efficiency and integrity, and eliminate all the accumulated bad habits of bureaucratic corruption, thereby creating an excellent political atmosphere, and then take a further step to amend the draft constitution and convene the National Assembly as scheduled to embark on the right track of constitutional governance.

### Announcement of the Verdict in the Wen Case

The verdict in the Wen case has been announced. The main offenders, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, were sentenced to death. The case has been reported to Chairman Chiang by Commander-in-Chief of the Army Gu Zhutong. Once approved, the execution will be carried out. At the same time, Huo Kuizhang, Commander-in-Chief of the Kunming Garrison, was dismissed from his post for dereliction of duty and placed under surveillance pending legal action. Thus, the Wen case, which caused a sensation for a time, has come to an end. Before the truth of this case was clear, we were not in a position to comment on it. Now that the case has ended, let us state our views:

Although the motives for assassination cases vary, the country has a legal code, and criminals can hardly escape the sanctions of the national law. When we heard the news of the assassination of Professor Wen Yiduo of the United Nations University, we mourned the shooting death of this scholar, which caused the country to lose a national talent and negatively affected the country's laws, social order, and international standing. As for the pursuit and prosecution of the murderers, that is naturally the responsibility of the national institutions. Before the murderers are caught and the truth is revealed, there is no need to make too many guesses or speculations. The current verdict in the Wen case shows that the motive for the assassination was purely simple, with no instigation or so-called political effect. It was purely a vengeful act committed by the murderer due to a momentary impulse. Obviously, it cannot be used by politicians as a kind of political capital to expand propaganda.

Second, for handling assassination cases, the country has existing institutions dedicated to the matter. The assassination of Professor Wen Yiduo is the same as the assassination of anyone else. In any country, assassination cases are almost inevitable. Therefore, the legal codes of various countries have clear provisions for the trial of assassination incidents. Now that the state has specially dispatched the Commander-in-Chief of the Army to preside over the investigation and trial of Professor Wen's death, this is certainly sufficient to show the importance that our government attaches to this case. It is in fact what the state should do. May I ask whether in the United Kingdom, the United States, or even the Soviet Union, would the Commander-in-Chief of the Army preside over the investigation and trial of the murder of a university professor? Now that the country is facing many difficulties, the government, in order to thoroughly investigate the case and handle it impartially, had no choice but to send a senior official to preside over it, and the outcome of the trial was also fair and impartial. All these things should be understood by the people of the country.

Now that the Wen case has been judged, the case can be closed once the main culprits are executed. As for the case of Li Gongpu, the murderer has not yet been arrested, so the details of the case have not yet been fully clarified. We can only earnestly hope that the government will step up the arrest of the murderer, and we dare to believe that the case will be solved one day, and the truth of the whole case will eventually come to light. Those who like to make trouble need not speculate too much. However, according to the facts of the crime published in the verdict of the Wen case, the cause of this case was that Professor Wen's speech at Li Gongpu's memorial service slandered the government and insulted the military even more, and the murderer was provoked by righteous indignation and developed the intention to kill. We believe that the murderer's violation of the criminal law is absolutely unforgivable, and what we feel regrettable about is that Professor Wen, such a talented person, as a professor at a national university, publicly slandered the government and even insulted the military, so that a lower-ranking military officer, whose knowledge was not as good as Wen's, and who was at the prime of his youth, had a tragic incident that went beyond the norm. Soldiers, like people in any other profession, inevitably have both good and bad people, but those who hold weapons to defend the country are still soldiers. They have experienced hundreds of battles and tasted all kinds of hardships, and they should be worthy of our love and respect. Professor Wen lived in a turbulent era, and his death is worthy of our regret, but it is also worthy of our deep consideration. China lacks talent, and we must cherish these few talents; and for the sake of the nation, we especially hope that these few talents should cherish themselves even more.

### Can the Government Suppress the Price of Yarn?

After the adjustment of foreign exchange last Monday, prices have been generally stable for the past week, especially for rice and flour, which have had the least fluctuations. Although gold once soared, it soon fell back and was not much different from the market price before the adjustment. Only cotton yarn is different!

Yesterday, the black market price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1.82 million, and it closed slightly lower at 1.78 million, an increase of 420,000 from 1.36 million the previous Saturday, a rise of 33 percent. 42-count Lanfeng yarn closed at 2.46 million, an increase of 550,000 from 1.9 million the previous Saturday, also a rise of 30 percent. If the government continues to stand by, it may continue to rise.

We have long pointed out that after the foreign exchange adjustment, if we really want to control prices and prevent them from rising, the government must use all its power to control them in advance. The Central Standing Committee discussed that it is necessary to control three categories of prices, namely (1) daily necessities for people's livelihood, such as rice, coal, oil, salt, cotton yarn, and cloth, etc., (2) transportation and public utilities, and (3) gold, the standard for exchange, so that they do not rise. We deeply agree with this. Now, the government claims to control the cotton yarn produced in large quantities, but it has had the bad effect of soaring prices for days. Who should be responsible for this?

According to reports, the China Textile Corporation, due to the decision of the board of directors, followed the government's instructions not to raise prices and sold yarn at yesterday's prices, with 20-count Lanfeng yarn at 1.16 million and 42-count Lanfeng yarn at 1.9 million, which were the same as before the foreign exchange adjustment on the previous Saturday. However, the black market price outside was 1.5 million for the former and as high as 2.46 million for the latter. First of all, we want to ask: Is the government going to do anything about it? Will it punish those who are raising prices on the black market? Second, we want to ask: Is the China Textile Corporation turning a blind eye to the fact that yarn distributed as usual can earn 4-500,000 yuan per package in the hands of yarn and cloth merchants who resell it? Third, we want to ask: On the day of the foreign exchange adjustment, the municipal government seemed to be vigorously stabilizing prices, and the trade association also seemed willing to work together to maintain the original price. How is the municipal government doing now? What is the trade association saying?

We believe that prices are a big cycle, and it is definitely not possible to allow one section to be broken through; otherwise, a single strand will affect the whole body. The rise in yarn prices may cause the rise in other prices. Today, whether the government can suppress the price of yarn is a touchstone for whether it can stabilize general prices in the future.

### Australian Representative Proposes Setting Up a Committee to Handle Compensation and Hospitality Matters, Based on the Principle of Not Threatening the Political Independence of Defeated Countries; Yugoslavia Demands Huge Reparations from Italy

[Reported by Our Newspaper from Multiple Sources] According to a broadcast from London on the 26th: The Yugoslav delegation formally proposed at the peace conference today that Italy pay 130 billion yuan in reparations, which is 14 times more than the amount that the four powers previously decided Italy should pay to the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia's demands include transferring some of Italy's factories, machinery, livestock, and remaining merchant ships to Yugoslavia as part of the reparations. At the same time, the Balkan Economic Committee met at the peace conference today to discuss the economic clauses in the treaty with Romania. The Australian representative proposed that the four powers and any three other countries selected should form an Allied Reparations Committee to handle the implementation of the reparations clauses in the treaty, while paying special attention to whether the defeated country has the ability to continue to pay reparations. It is stipulated that Romania should pay the Soviet Union goods worth 300 million yuan as reparations, to be paid in full in eight years. The Australian representative said that Australia did not want to demand reparations from any Balkan country, but was afraid that the excessive amount of reparations would inevitably threaten the political independence of these countries. We should help the defeated countries to stand on their feet in the international community and become independent countries in the future. The Australian representative advocated that any former enemy country should not directly hand over the reparations goods to the victorious country, but should hand them over to the Reparations Committee for transfer and conversion into reparations. In this way, the defeated country would only have relations with the United Nations and not have direct contact with the victorious country, which would better maintain its national sovereignty.

### Heated Debate Between Soviet and Australian Representatives at the Balkan Committee; Soviet Union Plans to Reduce its Reparations Demands from Hungary

According to Agence France-Presse: The Paris Peace Conference continued on the 26th, with the following agenda: (1) The Committee on Political and Territorial Questions Relating to Italy was scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM; (2) The Balkan Committee met; (3) The Military Committee met; (4) The Committee on Economic Questions Relating to Italy met at 4:00 PM; (5) The Committee on Political and Territorial Questions Relating to Bulgaria was also scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM.

According to a broadcast from Paris on the 26th: At the meeting of the Balkan Committee, Molotov stood up and made a lengthy speech refuting the Australian representative's arguments. He stated that the German army's invasion of the Soviet Union was due to the assistance of Antonescu's fascist army. He also recounted the fact that Romanian troops invaded and occupied Ukraine in 1941, saying that the Soviet Union would never forget these facts under any circumstances. Molotov continued that the terms of the armistice agreement with Romania were signed not only by the Soviet Union but also by the United States. The provisions of the treaty with Romania, which are in question here, are fair and well-founded. The Soviet Union believes that the economic situation in Romania after the war is already quite difficult. The Romanian delegation attending the peace conference did not object to the reparations clauses in the treaty, and the Australian representative's concern for this issue seems to be even greater than that of the Romanians themselves. However, Australia is thousands of miles away, and the Australian representative's proposal to pay reparations in British pounds or US dollars implies that Romania will rely on the British and American monetary systems. However, this method is not really beneficial to Romania and will only aggravate its plight. Molotov pointed out that the agreement on reparations between the Soviet Union and Romania is more reasonable. The Australian proposal is not of a nature to stabilize peace in Europe and is of no benefit to Australia itself. Therefore, he hoped that the Australian delegation would withdraw its amendment proposal, because Article 22 of the draft prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers provides all the advantages and guarantees. The French translation will be submitted tomorrow morning, at which point the meeting was adjourned. The meeting will then continue to review and discuss Article 22.

According to a United Press dispatch from Paris on the 26th: The Soviet Union is about to announce a reduction in its reparations demands from Hungary. The amount of the reduction has not yet been announced, but it is said to be considerable enough to ensure that Hungary does not need to restore its economy on a painful balancing basis. The Soviet Union also allowed more raw materials to be allocated to Hungarian factories, implementing Hungarian-Soviet reciprocity.

### Five-Nation Treaty Draft: 50,000 Words Awaiting Deliberation

[United Press, Paris] The Committee on Political and Territorial Questions Relating to Italy adopted 18 more words of the preamble to the Treaty with Italy on the 26th. In the four weeks since the peace conference began, a total of 153 words have been adopted. The draft treaty with the five defeated countries still has 55,000 words to be deliberated, and there has been no progress on the other four draft treaties. The 18 words passed are included in the fourth section of the preamble. After an hour of debate, they were unanimously approved, with Yugoslavia abstaining. The amendment was proposed by the Dutch representative to expand the recognition of Italy's assistance to the Allies after the overthrow of the Mussolini regime. After slight modifications, it was finally passed.

### Preparations for the Four-Power Conference to Expedite the Work of the Peace Conference

[Agence France-Presse] London diplomatic sources recently stated that as soon as British Foreign Secretary Bevin returns to Paris, steps will be taken to prepare for a Four-Power Conference to expedite the work of the peace conference. If the Four-Power Conference cannot be held, the peace conference will be delayed until the end of this year, and important issues such as the issues of Germany and Japan will not be resolved. Heads of delegations from several countries at the peace conference have left Paris. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt departed on the evening of the 24th to return to his country. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King departed on the morning of the 25th to return to his country via London.

### Ukraine Accuses Greece, Security Council Adds to Agenda; Britain Believes This is the Prelude to Soviet Action, Wanting to Force Britain and the United States to Withdraw from the Danube Region

[Reported by Our Newspaper from Multiple Sources] According to Agence France-Presse, New York, the United Nations Secretariat announced on the 25th that the Security Council will meet on the 28th of this month and has added the complaint filed by the Ukrainian representative to the agenda. At that time, the Council will first discuss the requests of several non-member states to join the United Nations organization, and then discuss this issue. According to Reuters, New York, observers at the United Nations Headquarters believe that the Ukrainian accusation against Greece's actions against Albania was filed at this time, not only because the issue of new member states will be discussed. However, the Ukrainian complaint is sufficient to strengthen Albania's demand to join the United Nations, which has been raised by the governments of Britain and the United States and is now being discussed. As to whether the British Permanent Representative Jebb will refer to the fact that there are British troops stationed in Greece as mentioned by Ukraine, the British delegation has not yet expressed its views.

### Astonishing News from the Soviet Union: Britain Establishes Military Supply Base in Tatar, Building Radar Stations to Detect Submarines

[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] The Soviet News Agency Beirut reported a report from "local people" that Britain has established a military supply base in Tatar, and a Turkish airfield near Istanbul has also been attached to the British. The military base is said to be similar in form to the base in Basra, Iraq, while the airfield is located in Eskishehir. The Soviet News Agency said that local people said that on the coast of Thrace in Greece and the Black Sea coast of Turkey, British military experts have set up a radar station to detect submarines. The Beirut report also said that a British military advisor and instructor at a radar station between Istanbul and Buyukdere threatened to resign unless he was directly responsible for the command of the radar station. The Turkish authorities immediately accepted his request, appointed him as the station chief, and assigned a Turkish military officer as his assistant. The Turkish News Agency stated yesterday that the Soviet News Agency's claim that the British were supervising the construction of airfields in Turkey was groundless.

### The Soviet Union Actively Develops Industry in the Far East

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] The Soviet Cabinet held a meeting today and passed several decrees aimed at promoting and developing light and heavy industry in the Ural region, Siberia, and the Soviet Far East, as well as coal, oil, building materials, and other industrial production. According to this decree, the wages of 824,000 workers employed in the various industries in these regions will be increased by 20%. The authorities also have housing for workers to live in, with each house priced at 8,000 to 13,000 rubles, to be paid in installments over ten years.

Reuters, London, the spokesperson of the British Foreign Office indicated this evening, that the Ukrainian accusation that the presence of British troops within the borders of Greece constitutes a threat to peace is simply an act of "diplomatic counteroffensive" on the part of the Soviet Union and its surrounding European bloc. The Ukrainian delegate's actions today are meant as an act of revenge against the Western powers for their recent joint expression of unity with Great Britain. Observers here also hold the view that these actions by the Soviet satellite states are not isolated incidents, but rather serve as the prelude to greater actions on the part of the Soviet government. The underlying goal is to strengthen their positions and force the Western powers to withdraw entirely from the Danube region.

### Tchaikovsky to be Appointed Soviet Ambassador to England

### Paterson's Report Delivered to Washington; American Southern Incident Comes to a Close; South to Hold Grand Funeral for the Victims

[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding Yugoslavia's attitude towards the American ultimatum, the State Department has received a report from the American Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Paterson, dispatched from Belgrade. According to a Washington dispatch from the U.S. Information Service on the 25th, the report details his negotiations with Marshal Tito. All the circumstances have already been reported in this newspaper in recent days, so I will not repeat them. In summary, although Yugoslavia has not expressed submission in writing, it has actually implemented all the demands in the American ultimatum. Under these circumstances, the U.S. government will decide on its countermeasures based on how the Yugoslav government "corrects its past mistakes and the future developments." Regarding the second American aircraft shot down on the 19th, it is now confirmed that all five people on board perished, and the remains are scheduled to be transported to Belgrade on the 27th. According to a United Press report from Belgrade on the 25th, the Yugoslav authorities have agreed to hold a grand funeral for the deceased American airmen. According to an announcement by the American Embassy, several officers from the Yugoslav Fourth Army will accompany the funeral procession to the cemetery where the remains of the deceased American airmen are buried, exhume the remains, and then have the hearse draped with the national flag drive past President Tito's summer villa and return to Ljubljana. When the remains are transported to Belgrade, a squadron of Yugoslav fighter planes will escort Ambassador Paterson's special plane to the capital.

Although this matter can be said to have temporarily come to an end, it cannot be interpreted as the end of the deteriorating relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia. According to news from Paris, Marshal Tito may file a complaint with the United Nations, accusing British and American planes of flying over Yugoslav territory "hundreds of times." He believes this is a violation of Yugoslav sovereignty and an attempt to threaten Yugoslavia. At the same time, according to a United Press report, American diplomatic circles in Washington believe that there are still various fundamental issues hindering relations between the U.S. and Yugoslavia, as well as between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which could erupt at any time, such as Trieste and the Dardanelles Strait.

### Dutch East Indies Requests MacArthur to Return Huge Amount of Diamonds Looted by Japan

### Indian Viceroy Arrives in Calcutta for Inspection; Riots Break Out Again in New Delhi; Several Suspects in the Attack on Arman Khan Arrested

[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] According to a United Press report, Indian Viceroy Wavell arrived in Calcutta by plane on the 26th and immediately began inspecting the areas affected by the Hindu-Muslim clashes last week. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London, riots broke out again in New Delhi on the 25th, resulting in two deaths and seventy-one injuries. At the same time, after Arman Khan, a member of the Indian Interim Government, was shot and injured by rioters yesterday, the police have arrested several suspects. Arman Khan is of the same religion as Muslims but is not a member of the Muslim League. The Muslim League has refused to participate in the government, and it is possible that Arman Khan was targeted for this reason.

Allocation of Positions in the New Indian Cabinet

Reuters New Delhi: The Indian Interim Government will take office on September 2nd. New cabinet members are expected to arrive here in succession within days, at which time the allocation of positions can be decided.

The expedition includes several British and Norwegian scientists, and Swedish scientist Ahlmann is also among them. The group will travel by the latest aircraft, equipped with radar equipment.

### China and India Join Hands; Element of Far Eastern Peace; New York University Professor Publishes Paper

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper New York, 25th] New York University Professor of International Affairs and Indian scholar Taraknath Das published a paper in the New York Times today entitled "Cooperation between Britain, America, China, and India is a Necessary Condition for World Peace and Progress." In the article, Das strongly argued for the significant influence of Chinese culture and politics on India, saying, "The division of China under the pretext of promoting peace may be cited as a precedent for the division of India and Pakistan." The article also pointed out, "The Soviet Union is currently adopting a policy of gradually splitting China and establishing puppet governments in various places." He said, "Indian leaders such as Nehru support the Chinese National Government. Indian leaders do not support the division of China into two regions, one communist and one national government. They believe that China should only have a national government free from external influence." Therefore, the author urged the U.S. authorities to explain their China policy to the Indian people through Chinese and American spokespersons. He said, "Friends of the Soviet Union in the United States have already used Indian newspapers to spread anti-American sentiment about China in India."

### International Court Judge Determines Puyi Was a Puppet; Treasonous Treaty Contained Four Key Points; Defense Continues to Intensify Cross-Examination

[Remodelling Society Tokyo, 26th] Puyi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, has testified in the International Court for a week and was finally determined to be a puppet by the presiding judge today. The defense continued to question. Kiyose first asked Puyi whether he had proposed two conditions when he took office as "Head of State": (1) to implement politics on a trial basis for two years, and (2) if the trial results violated the expectations of 30 million people, he would resign. Puyi replied that this was the case. He was also asked whether he had handed the "contract" to Commander Honjo before taking office as "Chief Executive." Kiyose immediately presented documentary evidence.

Puyi replied that he was confused last week and did not know it was this document. He said that this document was entirely from the Kwantung Army and was unconditionally accepted under the pressure of the Kwantung Army at the time. Kiyose then asked whether the "edict" issued after Puyi's first visit to Japan was of his own volition. Puyi replied that he had never instructed the issuance of such an edict, and that everything was controlled by Lieutenant General Yoshioka at the time. Kiyose also presented the book "Record of Accompanying the Visit" by Hayashi, reciting the poems made by Puyi in it. Puyi replied that these poems were just diplomatic language. He also said that Yoshioka came to Japan as a member of the Kwantung Army headquarters. Kiyose then asked about

the religious situation in Manchukuo.

Puyi replied that Yoshioka had said that religions other than shrines would be abolished and forced the military and schools to set up shrines. Kiyose then asked whether Puyi's wife was poisoned to death or killed due to insufficient glucose. Puyi repeated what he had said last time and said that based on the surrounding circumstances, he judged that his wife was poisoned. After the above questions and answers, the presiding judge finally declared: "We have decided that this witness is a puppet. Continuing the cross-examination is a waste of time." However, Kiyose continued to question: "Did you not issue an edict on December 8, 1941, saying that you would give full support to Japan?" He replied, "This matter was also said by the Japanese side." He asked, "On August 20, 1945, when the witness flew to Shenyang Airport, did you say to the 'Commander-in-Chief of Security' Inaba Torao: I am grateful to the Japanese 'Emperor' and people, but

nothing can be as you wish

?" He replied, "I don't know this person." Next, the defense attorney Okamoto presented the book "Twilight in the Forbidden City" by Puyi's teacher Johnston, asking Puyi whether the "Xuantong Imperial Salt" stamp on the preface of the book was Puyi's. Puyi was evasive, and after being reprimanded by the presiding judge, he said, "The name was signed by Zheng Xiaoxu, and the imperial listen was because Zheng Xiaoxu possessed it without authorization, so I don't know the details." Okamoto wanted to determine that it was Puyi's, and language adjudicator Major Muar said, "The witness is saying: The writing is not my writing, and although the seal is mine, I don't know if it's mine." Prosecutor Keenan expressed dissatisfaction with this, saying, "Colonel Muar does not understand Chinese." Colonel Muar then said, "Once Orientals are accused of saying something wrong, they want to avoid answering." Our prosecutor angrily stated that this sentence insulted Orientals, and as a result,

Colonel Muar apologized

to settle the matter. Okamoto then continued to question, and Puyi confessed: "There are about two hundred seals, but it seems to be used by Zheng Xiaoxu and Luo Zhenyu, but I have not given them the right to use them. Although the seal on the preface of the book written by Johnston is mine, I don't know when it was used. Also, although there is no error in the affairs of Peiping mentioned in the book, I have never lived with the author in Tianjin, and I am not responsible for what he said." He asked, "Who appointed Zheng Xiaoxu as the Prime Minister of 'Manchukuo'?" He replied, "It was decided by Commander Honjo first and then shown to me." He asked, "The witness repeatedly said to recover the lost land, who recovered it after all?" He replied, "China." He asked, "In 1931, did you hope for Sino-Japanese cooperation?" He replied, "There is no such thing." He asked, "Do you know that the Japanese government was originally passive about the Northeast Incident?" He replied, "The Japanese government's actions and words are always inconsistent."

Contents of the Treasonous Treaty

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Puppet Emperor Puyi continued to testify in the International Court today, admitting that he had signed a treasonous treaty with the Kwantung Army. The original text of the treaty was presented by Kiyose, the defender of Tojo, and was signed before Puyi took office as puppet emperor. The main points are as follows: (1) The authority to defend and enforce laws in Manchukuo is transferred to Japan; (2) Existing ports, waterways, railways, and highways are managed by Japan, and Japan can open new ports for national defense purposes; (3) Manchukuo must provide all assistance to equipment deemed necessary by the Japanese army; (4) Japanese people with vision and insight should be appointed as state advisors; (5) The above four articles are the basis for future treaties between Japan and Manchukuo. Kiyose spent a lot of time making Puyi admit that he had issued a statement of Sino-Japanese friendship when he visited Tokyo. Puyi argued that this statement was suggested by the Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau of Manchukuo and was not of his own volition.

### New Developments in the Bureau of Railways Embezzlement Case; Yu Xiangyan Suddenly Turns Herself In; Escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office for Overnight Interrogation; Startling Revelations: "Director Chen Extorted Five Million Yuan; Police Department Embezzled Seven Million Yuan in Stolen Money"

[Report from Our Newspaper] Two months ago, a 120 million yuan embezzlement case occurred in the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration. The main culprit, Zhang Hongtu, the Director of the Materials Department, and 17 of his staff were arrested by the Police Department of the Bureau of Railways on the afternoon of June 25th. After interrogation, it was discovered that Zhang's wife, Yu Xiangyan, was also a major suspect, but she had already disappeared. The Police Department ordered its subordinates and sent letters to various military and police agencies in the city to jointly arrest her, but after two months, there was still no trace of her. On one hand, the Police Department of the Bureau of Railways transferred the captured one thousand suspects to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, but because the case involved many businesses, the interrogation was troublesome, and because Yu Xiangyan was still delayed in turning herself in, the investigation has not yet been completed.

After the case occurred, our newspaper received two letters from Yu Xiangyan, defending her husband as much as possible, claiming that Director Chen Bozhuang knew about the matter in advance, and even seemed to imply that Chen was complicit in the embezzlement. She also claimed that she was suffering from illness and would turn herself in immediately after she recovered slightly, requesting that the truth be investigated according to law to avoid being falsely accused, etc. However, more than two months have passed since the case occurred, and Yu has not been seen turning herself in. According to Li Weiguang, the director of the Weiguang Hospital in the city, Yu Xiangyan is deeply addicted to drugs and needs to smoke five points of morphine every day. She went to the hospital to quit drugs, but disappeared after the case occurred.

Unexpectedly, at 10 p.m. the night before last, Yu Xiangyan, who had been missing for two months, suddenly appeared and went to Director Chen Bozhuang's residence on Bailinan Road. At that time, Director Chen was still working at the Bureau of Railways and had not returned home. His family telegraphed Chen, who ordered the Police Department to send police to bring Yu back to the Bureau of Railways. After detailed interrogation, she was handed over to the Police Department Detention Center for detention. At 7:30 p.m. last night, Cai Zhenbang, the chief of the Judicial Section of the Police Department, sent four police officers to transfer Yu to the District Prosecutor's Office along with the case file. Quan Tao, the prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office in charge of the case, opened the court for interrogation at 9 p.m. that night and ordered her detention after the investigation.

Yu wore a black Xiangyun yarn cheongsam, white socks, and black satin embroidered shoes. She was in good spirits and told reporters that she had returned to Songjiang to recuperate after the case occurred. She had returned to Shanghai for more than 20 days and had met with Director Chen three times. She was detained on the evening of the 25th for the third time. She said that Director Chen had extorted 5 million yuan from Zhang Hongtu, and she had solid evidence of this and would file a lawsuit with the court according to law. After the case occurred, Zhang Bokang, the chief of the procurement section, turned over more than 10 million yuan in stolen money, but the Police Department only handed over 3 million yuan to the court, and the remaining 7 million yuan was used and embezzled by the staff of the department. The District Prosecutor's Office will investigate the case in detail in the coming days, and the truth will be revealed soon.

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Chongqing Qiu Tianbin Fuli Jewelry Store moved to Shanghai to operate, Qiu Tianbao Deli Jewelry Store, No. 383 Nanjing Road, filed a lawsuit in the local court, accusing it of misappropriating the name of the business and requesting that it be prohibited from using it in the city.

### Reporters Tour Suzhou; Three Laps Around the City; Fly Away and Fly Back

[Report from Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) yesterday hosted an air tour of Suzhou for reporters from various newspapers in the city. More than 60 people participated, divided into two groups led by Chen Wenkuan, director of the Aircraft Flight Group of the company, driving a C-46 aircraft, and Chen Wenhui, chief pilot, driving a C-47 aircraft, which took off from Longhua Airport at about 11 a.m. The planes first circled over the city of Shanghai, and then flew along the railway line to Suzhou. Looking down from an altitude of 4,000 feet, only white clouds could be seen floating under the wings. Kunshan and Tiger Hill were only like small hills. Rivers and canals crisscrossed, and fields were like lines. The earth was like a green landscape painting. Fifteen minutes after the flight, the two planes arrived over Gusu (Suzhou) and flew around the city three times before returning to Shanghai, landing safely at 11:25 a.m. The entire flight took one hour and ten minutes, consuming more than 100 gallons of gasoline, costing a total of more than 2,000 US dollars.

### The Mystery of the Guisheng Steamer's Voyage

IWO officials say they have been approved to sail once more; Customs Administration replies to the Steamer Industry Association that clearance is not allowed.

[Our Newspaper] According to IWO officials who informed reporters yesterday, the Guisheng Steamer was carrying relief supplies from Hong Kong to Qingdao, Tianjin, and Shanghai, along with passengers and cargo. After arriving in Shanghai, it was opposed by the Chinese shipping industry, which sent a telegram to the customs to prohibit customs clearance. The company sent personnel to Beijing last Saturday to request understanding from the relevant authorities, which has been granted. However, it is only allowed once, and will not be repeated. It is said that the steamer is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow afternoon and head north. It is feared that foreign ships will no longer be able to load cargo and passengers in Shanghai for northern ports.

[Another Dispatch] The Shanghai Steamer Industry Association, having learned that the British-owned IWO's Guisheng Steamer was loading cargo and scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 27th, telegraphed the Chief of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office and the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance yesterday afternoon, ordering them to stop it and not allow customs clearance. They received the following reply from the Customs Administration last night: "To Director Du of the Shanghai Steamer Industry Commercial Guild, your telegram has been received. Regarding the IWO's Guisheng Steamer loading cargo and preparing for customs clearance today, it has been investigated and confirmed. The Jianghai Customs requested approval for the transportation due to the UNRRA's shipped materials. The Customs officials misunderstood the new regulations stipulated by the Yuan's order, thinking it was still within the scope of approval. We have ordered the customs to correct this and not allow the steamer to clear customs. This is a reply for your information, Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, Wei Qin."

### Lin Kanghou's Trial Concluded Yesterday; Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 31st of This Month

[Our Newspaper] The case of Lin Kanghou's suspected treason was continued to be heard by the High Court's collegial panel yesterday morning at 11:30 am. It lasted for over an hour and has been concluded after arguments. Sentencing is scheduled for the morning of the 31st of this month. According to the indictment of the High Procuratorate, Lin was captured by the enemy in Hong Kong after the Pacific War broke out in the 30th year. He was escorted to Shanghai along with Li Sihao and others. In the 32nd year, he became a director of the puppet National Commercial Control Association. In the 33rd year, when Wen Lan-ting served as the chairman of the puppet Commercial Control Association, Lin also served as the secretary-general of the association. At the same time, he served as a member of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, secretary-general of the Banking Industry Association, supervisor of the puppet Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and chairman of the American Chemical Factory. The indictment of the High Procuratorate stated that the factory supplied alcohol to the enemy, amounting to as much as 1,000 gallons per day.

Yesterday, Lin wore a dark blue, fine wool upper garment and gray western pants, with glasses on his nose, and was in good spirits. He stated: "I have served society for decades. I have always been loyal to the country and have not dared to falter. After Hong Kong fell, I was forced by the enemy to return to Shanghai. Among the puppet positions I held, my position as director and secretary-general of the puppet Commercial Control Association was to help my old friend Wen Lan-ting handle affairs. I had been serving as the secretary-general of the Banking Association before the war. The position as a member of the puppet Municipal Advisory Committee was designated and forced upon me by the then puppet mayor Chen Gongbo. As for the matter of the American Chemical Factory supplying alcohol to the enemy, I was not aware of it and cannot be held responsible. The predecessor of the factory was the Hequn Alcohol Factory, which was reorganized in the 28th year to establish the American Chemical Factory. At that time, I was in Hong Kong and was not familiar with its business. It was not until I was escorted to Shanghai in the 30th year that I became the chairman, and even that was not voluntary. During my tenure in the puppet Commercial Control Association, I never collected any materials for the enemy. Instead, I used my authority to collect over 100,000 pieces of cotton yarn, which I presented to the government after the victory. If I wanted to be a traitor, I would not have gone to Hong Kong that year, and it would not have been difficult to become a mayor in the puppet government. The fact that I was wanted by the puppet government in the 29th year shows my true intentions." The defense lawyers yesterday were Jiang Yiping and Fu Kuanglin.

Yu Hualong

The deputy director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Baojia Autonomy Preparatory Committee, currently 53 years old and from Fenghua, was also tried by the collegial panel yesterday. Yu stated: "Due to the frequent bomb attacks in various parts of the Public Concession at that time, the enemy puppets sealed off the areas where incidents occurred, which led to the establishment of the Baojia organization. My appointment was also out of compulsion, and it was also very convenient for the citizens." Yu Hualong was originally a lawyer, so yesterday in court, he cited legal provisions and did his best to defend himself, asking for a verdict of not guilty. The case is also scheduled to be sentenced on the 31st.

### Huang Zhuan and Others Interrogated Yesterday

On the same day, the cases of Huang Zhuan, chairman of the puppet Bamboo Industry Association; Feng Guanfu, translator of the enemy Dagong Textile Mill; Liu Bin, translator of the Ningbo puppet Township Police Joint Association; Huang Zhifang, acting director of the Zhennan Security Brigade's Resident Ningbo Office and adjutant of the Zhenbei Defense Regiment; Sun Liangui, staff member of the Zhennan Security Brigade; and Cai Tingbang, Taiwanese translator of the enemy Ningbo Gendarmerie, were examined. Witnesses were summoned to court for detailed inquiries, and all were postponed for further interrogation.

### Retrial of Yuan Shixiang and Chen Huichang

Furthermore, the case of Yuan Shixiang, manager of the former Laodahua Ballroom, and Chen Huichang, manager of the Venus Cafe, who were accused of treason by the Jew, Li Wei, was previously concluded by the High Court, which deemed that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred it to the Shanghai District Court for trial. The prosecutor refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial. Yesterday afternoon, the court reopened and summoned witnesses such as Zhou A Liang, a tea server at the Laodahua Ballroom, for questioning. The case was adjourned for further interrogation.

### Better Change Careers Early; "Daban's" Petition Disappoints

[Our Newspaper] More than 200 "Daban" dance hostesses from the 48 dance halls in the city that were ordered to be dismissed went to the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 a.m. yesterday in four trucks to petition. Director Zhao refused to meet them, saying that these people were neither employers nor employees, but parasites on society, and had nothing to do with the Labor Department. Thereupon, the "Daban" sent eight representatives to see Director Wu. Because Director Wu was away on official business, Deputy Director Li received them. The reason given by the representatives was: "The existence of dance hostess Daban is actually beneficial to the country, because it can promote the dance industry and increase national tax revenue." They also said, "If the system is not good, it can be improved. A complete ban will cut off people's livelihoods, so please ask the Social Affairs Bureau to ask the Police Department to withdraw its order." Deputy Director Li said that their words were unreasonable, and the Social Affairs Bureau absolutely agreed with the Police Department's measures, so he advised the "Daban" to quickly change careers. If they still wanted to work in dance halls, they would have to change their positions. The Social Affairs Bureau could convene the dance hall authorities to persuade them to give them priority in employment. The eight representatives, seeing that it was difficult to reverse the situation, quickly left.

### Military Court President Takes Office Today; Personnel Changes; Slight Personnel Adjustments

[Our Newspaper] After Liu Shifang resigned and went abroad, the position of President of the Military Court of the First Pacification Zone has been vacant for nearly two months. Although Judge Lu Qi has been acting as president, due to many difficulties, the work of the Military Court has almost been suspended for two months. The new president was already internally appointed. It is concurrently held by Li Liang, President of the Civil Division of the High Court. However, President Li has been too busy with the affairs of the Civil Division, and he also teaches at several universities, so he has been resigning. Recently, due to Commander Li's repeated urging, he has finally decided to reluctantly take on this part-time job and will officially take office today.

He repeatedly told reporters that his abilities are weak, and the trial work of the Civil Division of the High Court is almost concentrated on him alone. Now that he is splitting his time to concurrently serve as President of the Military Court, he is afraid that it will not be easy to do well, but he said that he will try his best. From September 1st, the court will resume full-day office hours, at which time he plans to hold court at the High Court in the morning and then go to the Military Court in the afternoon.

Regarding personnel adjustments, President Li said that, in addition to Lu Qi remaining in office, Qu Ze Zeng, Jiang Baoli, and Jiang Baolian have all resigned. Among the two prosecutors, Lin Wopeng will continue to work, and Gu Yongquan has also resigned. As for the clerks, almost all have left and been replaced. In addition to sending Zhang Shijie, a judge from the High Court, to concurrently serve as a judge, and transferring his capable subordinate Li Yechu to serve as Chief Clerk, the remaining vacant positions will have to wait for Director Liu of the Military Law Department of the Pacification Zone to come to Shanghai for consultation before a decision can be made.

### Huang Xianggu and Sun Yaodong Each Sentenced to Seven Years' Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday announced verdicts in five cases of suspected treason: Huang Xianggu, director of the puppet Social Simple Insurance Bureau, and Sun Yaodong, general manager of the puppet Fuxing Bank, were each sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for seven years. Secret agents Huang Jieting and Zheng Chengxue were each sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years. In addition, the postman Fan Rixin, who was previously accused of passing messages on behalf of the White Russian secret agents Dao Shi and Tao Ci brothers of the puppet Secret Service Headquarters, killing our underground worker Chen Sancai, was declared innocent due to lack of conclusive evidence.

### The Deceased Cannot Testify; Former Hardoon Employee Requests Retirement Pay

[Our Newspaper] Fifty-nine old employees of the Hardoon Foreign Firm who were dismissed in batches starting in April of the 33rd year of the Republic recently applied for mediation to the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that Hardoon and Madame Luo Jialing had verbally bequeathed that all old employees who had served for a long time could receive 500,000 yuan in retirement pay according to "custom". According to the 500,000 yuan at the time of retirement, the current legal currency should be worth 7.44 million yuan. However, the foreign firm only agreed to give three months' retirement pay, totaling less than 1 million yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the verbal will is unfounded and cannot be established. However, since each employee has served for more than ten years, it seems appropriate to give them retirement pay after retirement. The amount of retirement pay is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. If both parties insist, the Social Affairs Bureau will reject it and transfer it to the court for handling.

### Twenty-Three Nazi Spies; Ohlhaver and Others Initially Tried Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] Twenty-three German war criminals, including Ohlhaver, were given an initial investigation by the U.S. Military Tribunal yesterday. At 9:00 a.m., the seats in the gallery were already full. The twenty-three defendants sat in three rows. The leader, Ohlhaver, was the first person on the left in the first row. His head was already half bald, with a slight frown. He wore glasses, and his tall stature was a clear comparison to the short stature of his subordinate Skanski, who was sitting next to him. The puppet ambassador, Warmann, sat in the eighth position in the first row, his expression still trying to maintain his ambassadorial demeanor. The first person in the second row was Hess, who had lobbied our Guangxi generals. He had a shaved head and thick eyebrows, and his eye sockets were deep-set. The Consul of Guangzhou, Siebert, had white hair all over his head, and the Consul of Shanghai, Renthe, sat in the first and eighth positions in the back row, respectively. All the prisoners wore U.S. military khaki uniforms and looked natural.

In addition to the appointed Lieutenant Colonel Lau Yau-chung and Lieutenant Colonel Paul Ding, the defense bench included five lawyers hired by the defendants themselves: Yang Linzhi, Jiang Yiping, Qian Naiwen, Yao Zhaodi, and Plaime. After the chief prosecutor, Lieutenant Colonel O'Connor, read the indictment, the court asked each prisoner whether he pleaded guilty. Starting with Ohlhaver, all twenty-three Nazi war criminals stood up and loudly replied "Not guilty".

The court then asked the defense whether they had any objections to the opening of the case. The chief defense counsel, Lieutenant Colonel Lao Youzhong, stood up and said: "Only three weeks have passed between the filing of the public prosecution and the opening of the court today. The defendants' preparation work is not sufficient, so we request a postponement of the formal trial." Lawyer Yang Linzhi, on behalf of his clients Ohlhaver, Renthe, Haiboni, and others, submitted a protest against the U.S. Military Tribunal's jurisdiction to try the Germans in China, listing thirteen reasons. After the panel deliberated for five minutes, the presiding officer, Colonel Mellon, declared: "The protest against the court's trial of the case is rejected. The case is adjourned for three weeks and is scheduled to reopen on September 16." (The left picture shows the prisoners on trial.)

### Disposition of Traitor Property; Includes Original Property

Regarding the provision in the Regulations on the Suppression of Traitors concerning the confiscation of traitors' property, the scope of the confiscation has not been specified in detail, making it difficult for the Enemy Property Management Bureau to handle. The bureau recently received a resolution from the Executive Yuan transferred by the Judicial Yuan for a unified interpretation of laws and regulations, stating that the property to be confiscated includes all property obtained from the crime of treason, as well as other original property, and is not limited to property obtained from traitorous acts. Except for property that belongs to the public, should be recovered, or should be returned to the victims, all should be confiscated.

### Tampering with Milk Powder Trademarks; Criminal Prosecution

[Our Newspaper] Lin Songnian, a 40-year-old Ningbo native, works at the Scientific Instrument Hall at No. 406 Fuzhou Road. On the 20th, he purchased eighty cases of "Cow Butter Cup" milk powder (24 cans per case, 1 pound each) newly shipped from the American "Ronnie" factory to Shanghai from Chen Munian (who is engaged in import and export business and lives at No. 103 Chongqing Road). Because the packaging of the milk powder was not good, sales were not high, so Lin entrusted his friend Wang Zongkang (43-year-old Suzhou native, living at No. 154, Baoyuan Lane, No. 400 Jiangning Road) to completely remove the trademarks and text from the outside of the cans, intending to print the Scientific Instrument Hall's own brand. Wang first removed the trademarks from more than 20 cases of milk powder, but had not yet printed the new brand. The day before yesterday (the 24th), Wang's housemate, Zhou Yiliang, reported him to the Jiangning Sub-bureau in charge. Chen Kaizhou, the chief of the Criminal Division, ordered the police to investigate and found that it was true. He arrested Lin Songnian and Wang Zongkang and interrogated them on charges of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, violating criminal law, and planned to submit them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation within a few days.

### Young Woman Hides Firearms

[Our Newspaper] The Penglai sub-bureau of the Nanshi Police Department received a tip-off last night that Gong Lanhua, a young woman living at No. 14 Changming Lane, Wanyu Wharf, Dongjiadu, was hiding a large number of firearms at home. They ordered Han Jian, the patrolling officer of the Dongjiadu Police Station in charge, to lead a large number of police officers to surround the area. As a result, two shell guns, one revolver, and 160 rounds of ammunition were found. Wang Lanhua and apprentices Wan Zhenyuan and Li Hongnian were taken to the bureau for interrogation along with the guns and ammunition.

### Tax Officials Solicit Bribes; Investigated

The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau recently reported that Zeng Keguang and Lin Fu'an, tax officials of the bureau's Hunan Office, were using their positions to solicit bribes from shops in the Yangshuo Street and Nanqiao Street areas.

### Inside Story of the Woolen Felt Order Dispute

[Our Newspaper] Chiang Lu-tang, General Manager of the Huaying Enterprise Company at No. 40 Hong Kong Road, accused Kinzburg, a Jewish manager of the Lianying Company, of issuing bad checks in return for refunds. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to Kinzburg, he told reporters that in February of this year, Huaying Enterprise Company and his company signed a contract for him to order 1,000 rolls of oil felt from the United States. After the two parties signed the contract, the plaintiff delayed payment for as long as five weeks. At that time, there was a labor strike in the American woolen mill, and soon the American government banned the export of the goods, which delayed delivery. However, when the two parties signed the contract, it was stated that "This company is not responsible for any labor strikes or export bans in the United States." However, in order to settle the matter, he repeatedly negotiated with the plaintiff, voluntarily agreeing to return the payment and provide reasonable compensation. Unexpectedly, Chiang unreasonably threatened him, so he had to stop payment. It is now heard that since the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit, the defendant is also preparing to file a counterclaim.

At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, he took a pedicab to the museum to collect his prize. He won more than 20 famous clothes, including glass shoes, a children's raincoat, a jeep suit, and a youth suit, worth more than 1 million yuan. Mr. Huo is 17 years old and a junior in Zhongzheng Middle School. He felt very happy to receive this unexpected harvest and returned full of prizes. Before leaving, he told reporters: "My family, young and old, are old readers of Shen Bao. Although I am young, I have five years of newspaper reading experience. At first, I only looked at pictures and photos, and gradually paid attention to the content. I read it roughly and understood some current affairs. After Shen Bao gloriously resumed publication last year, it has been wonderful. From the first page to the twelfth page, each has its own advantages. I always read the paper before getting up every morning, and then get dressed and go to school. It has become a habit. If I don't read it for a day, I feel like I have lost something. Today, I am very grateful to Shen Bao and the major manufacturers for giving me many valuable gifts. My parents looked at the newspaper early this morning and compared the numbers. They were very happy to win the first prize. I am from Qufu, Shandong, the hometown of the Supreme Sage Confucius. Tomorrow is the birthday of the Holy Saint and Teacher's Day. I think the only way to respect Confucius is to read more books by sages and worthies to cultivate my personality and faithfully serve society and the country."

### Cruel and Stupid Act: Throwing a Sick Baby to Death

According to current law, it is a crime to abandon a person who is unable to save themselves or to kill one's own children.

### Dai Ailian's Profound Expressions and Smiling Frontier Dances

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Dai Ailian's dance performance was held last night at the Yi Yuan Theatre. The program included "Forest Maiden Kacha," "Gleaner Girl," "Homesick Tune," "Baan's Children," "Spring Outing," "Yao People's Drum," "Jiarong Wine Party," "The Mute Carrying the Madwoman," "Kanseer Khan," and "Youth Dance," encompassing the most popular local folk dances from Xinjiang, Xikang, Tibet, Sichuan, and other frontier regions. Among them, "Kanseer Khan" and "The Mute Carrying the Madwoman" were the most outstanding, earning the most applause. "Kanseer Khan" is a love song about a girl and a coachman from Dabancheng in Xinjiang, with a quiet dance style and profound expressions. "The Mute Carrying the Madwoman" depicts a mute old man with a long beard carrying a crazy and paralyzed woman (played by Huan Ailian), performing various actions. Dai Ailian's achievements in dance are extraordinary. A wave of her fan, a strike of her drum, all are skillful and beautiful. Joy, fear, shyness, longing, admiring herself in a mirror, picking flowers, wiping sweat—all her expressions and movements evoke a sense of intimacy. The members of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra were all smiles. Zhao Zukang, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, and his wife, who were sitting behind the reporter, repeatedly cheered. Dai Ailian's dance performance lacks the liveliness of "Ballet," but it is more intimate than "Ballet"; it lacks the melodiousness of opera, but it is more flavorful than opera. Because it is purely "our own thing."

After the performance, the reporter conducted a relatively detailed interview with Ms. Dai. According to Ms. Dai, "I have loved being active since I was a child, and I became interested in dance at the age of five. I formally started learning from a teacher at the age of twelve. In the past few years, I have come into contact with the ethnic groups in the southwestern and northwestern frontiers and discovered extremely rich material for local folk dances. Most of these folk dances have been influenced by ancient Han people. For example, the Tibetan 'Jumping Guo Zhuang' and 'Jumping Zizi' fully retain the legacy of the Tang Dynasty. By learning from these materials, I hope to create a path for Chinese national dance forms besides stage plays."

"I have been away from England for almost six years. During these six years, the art of dance in the world has been progressing every day. I have been secluded in the rear for so long that I have almost lost touch with the entire dance world. This time I go abroad, first of all, I must re-establish contact with this circle. Secondly, I want to introduce Chinese folk dances to the American stage. Thirdly, many of my classmates from England have gone to the United States and have already achieved great success, and I am eager to see them. Fourthly, I have not been home for fifteen years, so I can take this opportunity to see my old father in the West Indies. I will probably return to China in a year to continue studying folk dance."

They must be returned to the Chinese owners as soon as possible. The ancient books looted from the National Central Library in Nanjing have been cataloged and packaged, and are currently being prepared for shipment to Central China.

### Peking University Freshmen Will Go North Soon

[Report from Our Newspaper] Peking University admitted a total of 123 freshmen in the Shanghai area. Except for a few freshmen who have already taken a ship north, the majority have not yet left Shanghai. Recently, the "Peking University Shanghai Freshmen Going North Association" was established. In addition to sending a letter to Beiping requesting the university to arrange for ships to go north, they also requested the Peking University Alumni Association to provide full assistance. Wang Qinwang, the executive secretary of the Peking University Shanghai Alumni Association, has been working hard to find a solution. He has negotiated with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for approximately 80 cabin berths on the "Hai Xia" ship. According to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the "Hai Xia" ship has already carried students from the Southwest Associated University to the north for repatriation. It will return to Shanghai within a week and will stay in Shanghai for a few days before sailing to Tianjin again. There are also students from Beiyang University who will take this ship to the north for repatriation. If there are no temporary obstacles, the trip can be made within ten days. After learning this news, the Peking University students immediately issued a notice asking the Peking University freshmen to bring their Peking University admission certificates, two photos, a vaccination certificate, and 15,000 yuan for the fare to register at No. 41, Shangfang Garden, Lane 1285, Linsen Middle Road, from the 28th, 29th, and 30th of this month, in order to count the number of people and determine the cabin berths.

### Municipal Education Bureau Orders Private Schools to Reduce Parents' Burden as Much as Possible

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently issued an order to all private schools, stating: "Since the Anti-Japanese War, private primary and secondary schools in the city have steadfastly maintained their positions and worked hard to support themselves, and their enthusiasm for maintaining education is highly commendable. For the sake of local education, the Bureau should encourage and assist them to maintain their current state so that the teachers' lives are not in dire straits. Therefore, it is excusable for the schools to collect higher fees in order to maintain operations. However, at a time when people's livelihoods are declining, increasing the burden on parents may cause impoverished students to drop out of school. The Bureau has carefully studied this issue and deeply feels that maintaining private schools and preventing young people from dropping out of school should be considered concurrently. Private schools should uphold their original intention of persevering in maintaining education and recognize the state's intention of promoting education. They should reduce the burden on parents as much as possible. All fees payable by students must be collected in at least two installments. The number of tuition-free places for students must be at least 20% of the total number of students in the school, so that children from poor families can still have the opportunity to attend school. All of the above points must be strictly followed."

### China Institute in America in New York Repeatedly Raises Funds to Support Chinese Students Studying Abroad

[New York Shipping News] The China Institute in America in New York, in cooperation with the governments of China and the United States, raised funds during the war to subsidize financially struggling students studying abroad, allowing them to study with peace of mind and avoid excessive economic pressure. In the past five years, nearly a thousand Chinese students studying abroad have benefited from this assistance, and the achievements have been remarkable. With the end of the war, various scholarships were discontinued one after another. Considering that some students studying abroad could complete their studies soon, but their funding was not secured, causing panic in their academic life, and many years of dedicated research may be in vain, the association has consulted with various parties for assistance. Fortunately, it has recently obtained the consent of the Chinese Wartime Academic Planning Committee to allocate the remaining funds for the use of subsidizing a small number of students studying abroad. It is reported that students applying for assistance must have studied in the United States for one year and have studied full-time in the United States. Applicants must also fill out an application form with the China Institute in America, submit supporting documents, and provide definitive proof that they can complete their studies within the next six months. The applicant's academic transcript and thesis outline must also be submitted at the same time. It is reported that the application deadline for this partial scholarship is August 31st of this year.

### Municipal Primary Schools Collect Teacher Respect Money

The Education Bureau is carefully planning to collect tuition fees from municipal middle schools and teacher respect money from municipal primary schools.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's education funds are insufficient, and it is difficult to maintain the original municipal primary and secondary schools. The Municipal Education Bureau is carefully planning to collect tuition fees from municipal middle schools and teacher respect money from municipal primary schools starting this semester to help support them, and has stipulated the amount: (1) Junior high school tuition 40,000 yuan, (2) Senior high school tuition 60,000 yuan, (3) Primary schools, in addition to miscellaneous fees of 3,000 yuan and equipment fees of 5,000 yuan, will collect an additional 20,000 yuan of teacher respect money for primary grades and 30,000 yuan for senior grades, payable in two installments. Students from poor families may be exempted from tuition and teacher respect money, and the number of free students must be at least 20%.

The 16th Bao (Neighborhood) of the 26th District (Longhua) reports that the Songjiang County Police Bureau established a police station in Xinzhuang within their Bao, forcibly requiring businesses to register, which violates the original intention of temporarily maintaining the status quo until the demarcation line agreed upon by the province and the city is clarified. Therefore, the Bao reported to the District, which then reported to the Municipal Government, requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Government to swiftly order the Songjiang Police Bureau to withdraw the Xinzhuang police station. Furthermore, in Xinzhuang, the Xinzhuang Office of Songjiang County has sent personnel to paste Songjiang Jiangsu household plaques on each household and posted notices stating that this year's land tax, military rations, and autonomous household donations in Xinzhuang should also be collected on schedule like other places, causing widespread anxiety among the people.

### The 17th District Raises Funds for Local Education - Appoints Members to Organize a Committee

The 17th District (North Sichuan Road) has only five public and private primary schools in the entire district, causing many school-age children to be unable to attend school due to the lack of schools (there are more than 5,000 out-of-school children in the district). The District Office has repeatedly appealed to the education authorities and has been approved to establish Qingyun Primary School at the former site of the Municipal Zhabei Experimental Primary School on Qingyun Road. However, the school buildings were previously occupied by the enemy and severely damaged, and all school equipment is gone. With the start of the school year approaching, the funds for repairs and purchases are still unsettled. Therefore, local people enthusiastic about education have initiated the organization of a Fundraising Committee for Local Education Funds, with city councilors residing in the district and the heads of each Bao as members of the committee, to raise funds. In addition to supporting Qingyun Primary School, the funds will be used to establish additional primary schools, and a volunteer accountant will be hired to audit the donations, income, and expenditures, which will be publicized at any time. The list of all committee members was submitted by the District Office to the Municipal Government for approval yesterday.

Since District Office People's Representative Wei Qingyun had resigned, Xu Weixin, who received the next highest number of votes, should be appointed as a replacement according to law. The matter was reported to the Municipal Government for approval yesterday.

### Q&A on Doubts Regarding Household Registration Regulations (Continued)

(43) Question: Mr. A has his original household registration in County A, but has obtained temporary household registration in County B. If Mr. A's family members from his original household registration (such as his mother, wife, etc.) move into Mr. A's temporary household registration, can they obtain temporary household registration from the date of their move, or should they apply for temporary residence? Who should be the head of the household? Answer: The acquisition of temporary household registration has specific conditions stipulated in Article 5 of the Household Registration Law. When family members of someone who has already obtained temporary household registration move into the household, they can only apply for temporary residence. Before fulfilling the legal conditions, they cannot immediately obtain temporary household registration. Mr. A will still be the head of the household.

### Spinning and Construction Did Not Increase Prices, the Black Market Rebounded Sharply Yesterday - Huge Profits from Reselling Lead to a Surge in Applications - Hoping That Private Factories Will Adopt the Same Measures

[Reported by this Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market suffered from a shortage of supply from major yarn factories. Furthermore, a responsible person from China Textile Corporation stated last Sunday that they would implement price increases regardless of social criticism. This stimulated the market and, after opening, the prices of all grades of cotton yarn rose in a straight line amid a buying frenzy. 20-count yarn rose by 100,000 yuan. 32 and 42-count yarn rose by 200,000 yuan, setting a new record after the exchange rate adjustment. However, at noon, the Spinning and Construction Company posted its price list, continuing to allocate sales as usual, and the price also remained unchanged. It was also reported that Shenxin Yarn Factory distributed double horse, heavenly maiden, and red man brands to the industry yesterday. Although the prices were slightly lower than the black market prices, they had already risen by more than 20% compared to the selling prices before the exchange rate adjustment.

The reporter then interviewed the authorities of the Spinning and Construction Company to inquire about the company's allocation situation and opinions on curbing the rampant cotton yarn black market. According to the response: After the exchange rate adjustment, the cost of raw cotton used by various yarn factories, most of which is sourced from overseas, has undoubtedly increased. However, the spinning and construction authorities have always maintained the original price allocation before the exchange rate adjustment and have not changed the allocation quantity. However, after the exchange rate adjustment last week, cotton yarn market prices rose, and applications for purchases flocked in. The number of applications was exceptionally large. Spinning and Construction continued to allocate according to the usual quantity. It is estimated that each day last Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 2,000 to 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn of various counts were allocated. As for yesterday's situation, there were as many as 4,000 application forms. If each form applied for 20 packages, that would be a total of over 80,000 packages. This huge demand is obviously inappropriate. In terms of Spinning and Construction's allocation price, it currently remains unchanged. For example, the allocation price for 20-count Blue Phoenix is 1.16 million yuan per piece, while the black market price yesterday was 1.5 million yuan. The allocation price for 42-count Blue Phoenix is 1.9 million yuan per piece, while the black market price yesterday was 2.46 million yuan. Those who receive the allocated goods immediately make huge profits by reselling them. Therefore, applicants come one after another. The Spinning and Construction authorities, as a state-owned enterprise, are still painstakingly maintaining the original price. It is hoped that private yarn factories will not be pessimistic and will work hard to cooperate with Spinning and Construction to stabilize banknote prices. It is estimated that the various factories affiliated with Spinning and Construction in this city currently produce about 600 pieces of yarn per day. The total production of private yarn factories is also similar. Therefore, if they can unite and jointly maintain the yarn market, the black market will definitely not be so rampant. Otherwise, relying solely on Spinning and Construction to maintain low prices will only result in a few yarn merchants profiting, without actually benefiting general consumers.

### Minister Wang Calls Yarn Factory Representatives to Discuss the Cotton Yarn Supply Problem

With the prices of yarn and cloth rising sharply in recent days, the China Textile Corporation held its eighth board meeting the day before yesterday. The directors debated for a very long time on whether to adjust the allocation price of China Textile Corporation and reduce the difference between the allocation price and the black market price. As a result, the allocation price was not changed in principle. The specific implementation methods were handed over to the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for research and decision. It is learned that Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, in addition to presiding over the China Textile Corporation's board meeting, also held a symposium on the cotton yarn supply problem at the office of the special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Those who were called to attend included Zhang Zi, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Wu Weijing, the deputy general manager of China Textile Corporation, Guo Dihua of Yong'an Yarn Factory, Rong Hongyuan of Quxin Yarn Factory, Wu Kunsheng of Shenjiu, Tong Kuofu of Xinyu, and Wang Qizi, etc. Presided over by Minister Wang, the quantity and price of cotton yarn supplied by various yarn factories were discussed in detail. It is hoped that the private yarn factories will assist the government in suppressing cotton yarn prices.

### Cloth Prices Rise in Unison

The cloth market continues to rise, and the price increase is becoming more intense. This is because sales in other ports have expanded, and partly because spot goods are tight. The market is continuing to rise and increase. Gray cloth and cheap cloth have strong upward momentum. However, the Spinning and Construction Company allocates goods as usual, but the public is still enthusiastic. As a result, the prices of various grades of cloth have risen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Tomorrow is Confucius' birthday, and the market will be closed.

### Overbought Positions Emerge; Unified Bonds Gradually Decline

After various sectors expressed their opinions on pre-war debt, all kinds of extravagant hopes were diluted again, and overbought positions were sold off one after another. At the opening of Unified Bond C this morning, it inherited the lingering momentum from last Saturday, pushing it up to around 2,100 yuan. However, it was soon suppressed by selling pressure and gradually declined. At one point, the low price reached 1,600 yuan before stabilizing. At noon, it struggled above 1,650 yuan. As a result, A, B, and C bonds each fell by more than 200 yuan compared to the previous close, while D and E bonds fell by 180 yuan.

### Gold and Banknotes Rise

The spot market continued to weaken yesterday. There was still pressure at high prices, and it did not break out of the consolidation pattern. In the morning, it was pulled up to 2.17 million yuan due to small silver houses covering their positions. After the opening, it rose to 2.18 million yuan before supply appeared, forcing it downstream. After 10:00 AM, it occasionally reached 2.16 million yuan, and the Central Bank allocated 150 bars at this price. After that, it stagnated. At noon, it was still hovering around 2.165 million yuan. In the afternoon, the Guangdong banking sector slightly increased, showing a slight increase. As a result, it was 10,000 yuan higher than last Saturday. Ornaments and silver were flat. Silver coins were in demand. Due to the approaching end of the month, the interest rate on private loans was high, ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 jiao, and even more than 1.8 jiao outside the market.

Foreign currencies were stable and unchanged. The U.S. dollar opened at 3,400 yuan to 3,420 yuan this morning. After the opening, it slightly fell to within 3,400 yuan and then became mediocre, struggling around 3,390 yuan until noon. In the afternoon, it showed a slight improvement. As a result, it was slightly higher than last Saturday by 10 yuan. Hong Kong tickets were stable and remained around 750 yuan. As a result, they were slightly higher than last Saturday by 10 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate had sellers at 750 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate still stood at the listed price. The British exchange rate was 12,000 yuan, and the Indian exchange rate was 910 yuan, all of which had sellers, but buyers were not excited, and transactions were limited.

### The Tea Market is Booming; Holders are Reluctant to Sell

The domestic sales of black and green tea, except for Tianjin, which is relatively sluggish, are still constantly surging in other places. The process is exceptionally solid. As for the foreign tea market, the attention is focused on the tight trend of fine red tea in India. Because the supply and inventory are both exhausted, transactions are ultimately lacking. However, at present, in order to meet the urgent needs, the industry has temporarily substituted Hao Men fragrant tea and coarse red tea for the shortage. Therefore, the transaction of these two styles has been quite prosperous in recent days, and the selling price is also like a horse out of its reins. Other goods such as Fujian red tea, Qimen red tea, Chenchou Zhen, Chenzhen Mei, etc., are constantly being absorbed by exporters, and the market atmosphere is like a hurricane following closely behind. It is reported that Jardine Matheson and Shanghai Union have a preference for Chenzhong Qimen, and are willing to welcome them at a price of 100,000 to 120,000 yuan per dan. However, recently, the holders' minds have been unusually profitable, and they are reluctant to sell lightly, all holding a wait-and-see attitude.

Shanghai Import and Export Statistics for July

According to the customs publication, the total value of Shanghai's import and export goods for July of this year is as follows (unit: thousands of yuan):

The import goods in July were still dominated by cotton, followed by oils, fats, candles, and soaps, and then cotton textiles and Western medicines and chemicals. The export goods were dominated by raw silk, followed by leather, and then tung oil.

### The Market is Closed Today for Confucius' Birthday

Today (the 27th) is Confucius' birthday. Businesses in this city, from the financial sector to major markets, stores, and factories, are all closed for one day as usual. All agencies are also closed for the holiday. However, the post office's office hours are the same as on Sundays.

### The Source of New Rice is Gradually Booming; Japonica and Indica Trends are Peaceful

Yesterday, the total registration of rice arriving at the North and South markets was about 4,000 shi, mainly new goods. There were supplies from Nanjing, Liyang, and Jiaxing. The source of new japonica rice from Pudong is also abundant. However, there is very little old japonica rice and less white yuan, so old japonica rice is strong, new japonica rice is high and cheap, and white yuan is a rare commodity, soaring by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Both new and old indica rice are showing a peaceful trend. Foreign rice is allocated, totaling more than 17,000 bags in the North and South markets. Flour factories have not opened up much, and retail sales are very high, with supply not meeting demand. The outside price has risen by 100 to 200 yuan. Foreign flour is also showing a strong trend. Bran is continuously consumed in rural areas. Wheat is turning active in the north. The supply from various inland routes is scarce. Fujian and Yong have also taken a liking. The high-grade goods have risen by 500 to 600 yuan, while the middle and low grades are fair. The arrival of yellow soybeans is still weak, and consumption is also sluggish, continuing to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The high-grade broad beans have risen by 500 to 600 yuan. The Guangdong banking sector's liking for raw kernels is still acceptable, gradually increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply of oil to the market is slightly scarce, and consumption is lively. The situation is again trending towards supply falling short of demand, and prices have risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bean cake continues to be slightly lower by 100 to 200 yuan, and Tianjin cake is slightly lower by 400 to 500 yuan.

### Appropriating Enemy and Puppet Cloth to Exchange for Sugar and Coal from Taiwan Province

The Total Value of Delivered Goods Exceeds 1.3 Billion Yuan

Previously, the government authorities instructed the Spinning and Construction Company to appropriate the enemy and puppet cloth received by the Disposal Bureau and hand it over to the Taiwan Trade Bureau to exchange for sugar and coal from Taiwan Province to be transported to the Disposal Bureau for barter. Since taking on the business, the Spinning and Construction Company has handed over cloth worth 1,082.32 million yuan. It is learned that recently, another 136 pieces of cloth, totaling 45,099 bolts, including bleached government cloth, twill, coarse twill, black cloth, and yellow khaki, etc., worth a total of 240.4693 million yuan, have been handed over. The two totals are more than 1,322.7893 million yuan. The last batch has been successively received by the Shanghai Office of the Taiwan Trade Bureau.

### The Number of Deposits in Commercial Banks and Zhuang in This City at the End of July

The Financial Inspection Office of the Central Bank published the commercial banks and Zhuang deposits in Shanghai this year. As of the end of July, the total was 149,132,525,748.78 yuan. The deposit reserve paid to the Central Bank was 29,495,451,343.24 yuan. Among the deposits, current deposits accounted for 145,504,755,000.80 yuan, and fixed deposits only accounted for 12,627,770,747.99 yuan.

### The Asphalt Price Increase is Not Weakening

The bottom line for asphalt in various places is weak, the hot weather has not subsided, and transportation is inconvenient, resulting in a daily decrease in sources. However, candle manufacturing will all start to surge. The usual amount is in high demand, and the difference between supply and demand is too far. Zhejiang oil has repeatedly telegraphed price increases. According to yesterday's statistics, the internal Ping oil must be 100,230 yuan, and the oil for variable transportation is 98,000 yuan. Hankou reported that the Bin city oil has moisture and must be 74,500 yuan. It is sold upon arrival, without any accumulation. The Shanghai market relies entirely on two sources, which is so short of goods that the impact is not light. Therefore, the Jiaxing Benz oil is a rare commodity. It is heard that the place of origin has been sold to outside 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. The wholesale of He Benz oil in Shanghai is 128,000 yuan, the internal Benz oil is 115,000 yuan, the sharp oil is 112,000 yuan, the Qian oil is 110,000 yuan, the Shuanglian Lan oil is 107,800 yuan, and the Macheng oil is 100,000 yuan.

### The Lack of Sugar is Getting Tighter and Tighter

The Guild Hall Has Not Yet Opened

Recently, although there have been continued arrivals of Shantou Gang sugar, the goods have not yet been put on the shelves, resulting in a tight shortage of spot goods. The opening price has been tight and not relaxed. The price of Gongfenbai has been between 164,000 yuan and 150,000 yuan for the past few days. Xingchi is 40,000 yuan, Youchi is 145,000 yuan, and the price of sugar last Saturday was 115,000 to 6,000 yuan. The market rose again by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan yesterday. A total of 600 to 700 pieces were traded within 32 days, entirely direct transactions between businesses. The guild hall has not yet opened.

### After the Foreign Exchange Adjustment, the Export of White Tung Oil Gradually Opens Up, but the Source is Scarce and Difficult to Supply

Since the change in foreign exchange, the foreign trade of white tung oil has indeed been accessible. A small number of transactions have already taken place the day before yesterday. The cost is US$0.33 per pound, and the delivery to the dock in a fast bucket is between 115,000 yuan per net weight. After this adjustment, it may be possible to export it steadily in the future. After the seven or eight years of war, the loss of tung trees in various producing areas is indeed not small. The output is no longer comparable to that before the war, and the number of oils used for lighting before the arrival of kerosene in poor rural areas is also considerable. Although the export quantity has decreased and even been destroyed, there is no large accumulation in the producing areas. Even if the price of oil is raised, the source is still scarce. Although exports are accessible, it is feared that the supply will be difficult to be smooth. The devastation of the products after the chaos is not just one item of tung oil. The wholesale and retail sales of each family in Shanghai are the same, and the estimated price is 115,000 yuan per unit, and the summer sales will be reduced to a decree, only a scattered embellishment.

Hongjiang tung oil will inevitably increase in cost in the future after the white tung oil rises. When the current value is sold, the command cannot be extrapolated from this, and the stock is quite thick, only slightly added, to show sympathy. The current price of each brand of Xifu is 85,000 yuan.

(Another message) The selling price of London tung oil is 275 pounds per ton at the dock for users (including commission), which seems to have increased compared to the previous 230 pounds. The above pound price is equivalent to 155,375 yuan per unit of national currency. Today, the full amount of tung oil in the Shanghai market is still less made, and both buyers and sellers seem to still have a wait-and-see attitude, and the price is unchanged from last Saturday.

### Kerosene Has Indeed Increased in Price; Gasoline Will Also Increase Accordingly; Gas Stations Claim to Be Sold Out

[Reported by this Newspaper] After the exchange rate adjustment, the cost of liquid fuels such as foreign kerosene and gasoline has also increased. In recent days, although the gasoline at gas stations has maintained the original price, which is 750 yuan per gallon, the supply has been slightly limited. Yesterday, some gas stations even claimed to be sold out and refused to add gasoline. As for kerosene, most stores have increased the price from 200 yuan to 300 yuan per catty. The reporter inquired about this matter with Mobil Oil Company yesterday. According to the company, the price of the company's brand new listening and bulk kerosene has indeed changed slightly since the exchange rate was called. The Shanghai delivery price for each pair of brand new products (a total of 10 gallons in two listening) was originally 13,250 yuan, and now it is 22,100 yuan, or 2,210 yuan per gallon. In addition, the ex-warehouse delivery price in Pudong for every 10 gallons of bulk kerosene was originally 8,500 yuan, and is now 14,000 yuan, which is 1,400 yuan per gallon. The adjustment of gasoline prices is currently under consideration. It is said that the adjustment of kerosene and gasoline prices by various American gasoline companies is roughly the same.

### Export Tax Exemption; Tianjin Bristles Rise

[Tianjin, 25th Telegraph] Tianjin's pig bristle exports were once suspended due to poor quality. Later, the New York market still had a strong demand for Chinese pig bristles, so the market became active and exports increased. Since the government announced the exemption of export tax on the 19th and changed the U.S. exchange rate ratio, pig bristles have risen, and the transaction has been very successful. The market price this month, the improved 55-box set of goods, is 15,800 yuan per catty, the 50-box set of goods is 35,200 yuan per catty, and the 43-box set of goods is 18,500 yuan per catty, which is about 50% higher than before May. There is still a possibility of continued increase in the future.

### The Opening Period of the Securities Exchange is Approaching; Bargain Stocks Are in Great Demand; Matching Transactions Will Be Made Until the 28th

Because the counterparty matching company in the Chinese stock industry will implement the actual transaction until the 28th, the multi-empty chips will inevitably be straightened, and they will be confused. However, because the securities exchange will be reopened soon, the major buying power from the bargain stocks is more than enough, and Mei Ya's status is still strong, and Yong Yarn has a forced short squeeze trend. Therefore, the initial opening is still stable, and the low price is reported one or two gears lower, but it is not easy to obtain. As soon as the bargain is opened, it will be expensive, and the morale is revitalized and revitalized. The various stocks are gradually prospering, and the high price is shown in the middle. Then the market is transformed, but the closing is low and high again. As a result, Yong Yarn and Mei Ya each rose by nearly half, Jingfu was flat, and Xin Guangqinxing rose slightly. The medium-sized stocks were about 10% weaker, and the small stocks rose by 10% to 15%. The veteran stocks also increased by 10% to 20%. After the noon market, the amount of yarn in the outside market suddenly increased and the short squeeze was very strong, and the asking price was increased to 730 yuan.

Foreign stocks are still led by Western merchants who choose low prices to invest, leading the price increase. Hot stocks have lost their color. Yisha has been raised from 8,700 yuan to 9,300 yuan, British United has risen from 9,700 yuan to 10,400 yuan, Yipi has been well organized from 2,050 yuan to 2,225 yuan, and Asia has risen from 1,800 yuan to 1,950 yuan. The situation is extremely strong and abnormal. As a result, Yisha, British United and Yiguang each rose by nearly half compared with last Saturday, while Huidexte, Steel, Asia, Yipi and Paper each rose by about 10%.

### 30,000 Bags of Rice Stored by the Ministry of Grain Were Transported from Jiujiang Yesterday

30,000 bags of rice stored by the Ministry of Food were shipped from Jiujiang to Shanghai by the Xin Yingping, an agent of the China Merchants Bureau, and arrived yesterday to regulate the local food supply.

### The Order to Purchase Raw Silk has Arrived in Shanghai

It is confirmed that the government's order to purchase raw silk has arrived in Shanghai and is being handled by the Commodity Exchange Office of the Central Trust Bureau. As for the previous rumor that it would be jointly purchased by the China Silk Company, it was a misunderstanding. A director of the China Silk Company has denied it. As for the detailed methods and various procedures for the purchase, it will be announced within three days.

### Recruiting Bureau's Zhongkai Ship Exports: Freight Rates Break Records; Large Quantities of Relief Goods Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shunheng Foreign Company, managed by Finkler Fulei, brought 9,090 bales of cotton and 19,268 packages of old clothes and shoes from Boston on the ship "Meihaosi Dun." The ship also contained over 930 barrels of tallow, 3,170 blocks of lead, 270 blocks of steel plate, and over 1,120 packages of soda ash. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and unloaded at floating docks number three and four. Furthermore, the company's "Luosifan'er" ship also arrived yesterday afternoon, carrying over 8,330 railway sleepers for the Ministry of Communications, 2,000 bags of flour, 4,700 pieces of lumber, and 2,150 boxes of canned food. It also contained over 14,000 boxes of "Shui Ye" (possibly a type of drink). Although today is Confucius' birthday, the ship continued unloading cargo as usual because it contained "Shui Cai" (presumably a type of perishable food). In addition, the Taikoo Blue Funnel Line's "Samson" ship arrived yesterday evening, carrying 8,135 tons of wheat from Australia, all for relief.

Exports included large quantities of cotton yarn and cotton cloth destined for Guangdong. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Zhongkai" ship sailed directly to Guangzhou yesterday afternoon, carrying 2,000 tons of cotton yarn and cloth, approximately over 6,000 pieces, plus 600 tons of general merchandise. It is said that the ship's export freight rates broke the company's post-restoration record for each voyage.

### Diamond Sales Boom: A Result of Inflation

[United Press, Cape Town, 25th] Due to fears of inflation and news from the United States regarding changes to price control measures, the diamond trade in South Africa is now experiencing another boom. Many diamonds are being exported because people in Europe and the United States fear inflation and the devaluation of currency, and are therefore buying diamonds as a form of savings. At the same time, refugees from Europe and the Far East, unable to exchange large amounts of foreign currency before returning home, are also buying diamonds to carry with them.

### Fresh Pig Intestines Double in Price: Traders Plan to Unify Purchases

After the foreign exchange rate adjustment, overseas casing prices have decreased slightly, but the price of fresh pig intestines in Shanghai has skyrocketed. Each set now costs between 800 and 900 yuan, almost 100% increase than before the increase. There is much criticism among traders towards those involved in acquisitions. It is rumored that the traders will convene a meeting soon, and they may form a cooperative for unified purchasing in order to standardize acquisition prices.

### Xing Four Yuan (Silver Coins) Rise by 10-20%

Xinghua Four Yuan coins are scarce and the prices of miscellaneous goods have risen by 40,000-50,000 yuan. As a result, the asking price has increased. The current market asking price has risen by 10-20%.

### Correction

In yesterday's news about the establishment of the Vegetable Vendors' Exchange, the commission taken by the brokers from the cargo owners was mistakenly printed as 30%. It should be 10%. We hereby correct this error.

### Silver and Money Industry Reserve Association to be Established on September 2nd; Valuation Committee to Assess Assets; Three Banks and Two Bureaus Decide Not to Participate

The Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve Association, which has been in preparation for a long time, has already recruited all business firms and trust companies as members since the work began. Foreign banks, except for Citibank Chase, which requested to retain its membership, must first consult with their head offices. The reason for the delay in convening the members' meeting was to wait for the final decision on whether the three banks and two bureaus would participate. Now that the three banks and two bureaus have been instructed by the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks to withdraw from joining, the Preparatory Committee has decided to hold an establishment meeting at 3:00 PM on the 2nd of next month at the Bankers' Association. At that time, various firms and trust companies will send representatives to participate and elect seven executive committee members, who will then elect three standing committee members and a chairman from among themselves. The chairman will be stationed at the association to preside over its affairs. After the members sign the articles of association, the Valuation Committee will be established. The committee will consist of nine to eleven members, with three executive committee members as ex officio members. The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank will each send one representative, and the remaining members will be experts in stocks, goods, and real estate. The committee will review the reserve assets submitted by the members and issue treasury bills at 70% of the market value, which may total around 20 billion yuan. The reserve assets will be kept in full custody by the Central Bank.

### August in Xi'an

— Xi'an Airmail Report on the 22nd. Special Correspondent: Li Chi

While important figures from Nanjing and Shanghai are traveling to Kuling and Lu Shan to escape the heat, Xi'an has already passed the peak of summer. This summer, as predicted by meteorologists, the temperature is generally lower than average due to solar flare activity. The average temperature difference between Kuling/Lu Shan and Nanjing/Shanghai in summer is only about ten degrees.

Total Number of University Applicants Expected to Exceed 6,000

The autumn sky is clear and the air is crisp, and the season for studying is approaching. This year, the National Northwestern University has moved back to Xi'an, and part of the National Northwestern Institute of Technology is also located in the city (with the other part in Xianyang). As a result, there are many more applicants in the city recently. In addition, National Central University, Peiyang University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Lanzhou University are also recruiting new students in Shaanxi. Despite the many opportunities to apply, they are still not enough for the large number of applicants. As early as this time last year, some students who dropped out of school during the war predicted that this year's applications would be difficult due to the large number of people and the limited number of places. In addition, transportation is still not smooth, so many students who originally wanted to study in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, or Shanghai have no choice but to change their plans and temporarily apply for admission here.

According to the figures released by the authorities of each school, the ratio of applicants to enrollment places has reached more than one hundred to one in some colleges, and the difficulty can be imagined. It is estimated that the number of high school graduates applying to various universities this autumn will exceed 6,000, while the total number of admitted students will be less than 1,000, and nearly half of these places will be reserved for demobilized youth soldiers. Taking the Northwestern University as an example: there are more than 2,000 applicants, but there are only 260 places, of which 70 must be reserved for youth soldiers and 20 for those recommended by the National Frontier College.

Students Desperate, Educational Circles Planning to Establish "Night University"

Undoubtedly, thousands of high school graduates will "sigh at the door" of various universities this autumn. Should they be solely responsible for their dropped-out education? No, of course not. The Shaanxi branch of the Kuomintang has telegraphed the Central Government and the Ministry of Education, asking them to instruct the Northwestern universities and colleges to add double classes and double the number of admissions to seek partial remedies. In reality, even if the number of places is increased threefold, there will still be those who "miss out."

Another meaningful proposal is planned by Wang Youzhi, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, and Liu Jihong, President of the Western University. They believe that many young people need to balance their studies and employment, and the establishment of a "Night University" will solve the problems for countless hard-working students. This "Night University" will be established in Xi'an and will offer classes at night, but efforts must be made to ensure that its academic qualifications are recognized by all parties and are no different from those of schools that offer classes during the day.

After "Xi Da" (Northwestern University) moves back to Xi'an from Chenggu, it will increase the academic atmosphere of this ancient city. In Guangxi, "Xi Da" is the abbreviation for Guangxi University, and in Yunnan, some people also refer to "Southwest Associated University" as "Xi Da." The latter and the predecessor of this National Northwestern University, "Northwest Associated University," were wartime "sister universities." In the era of Northwestern University, there were only three colleges: Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce. Later, the Northwestern Medical College merged in, and since then there have been four colleges. (In the past, there were also the College of Agriculture and the College of Education, for a total of six colleges). Furthermore, if you look at the history of university education in our country, there was also a "Northwestern University" more than twenty years ago, but there is no "blood" relationship between the two.

The "Xi Da" campus is not far outside the south of the city, with more than 800 buildings of all sizes. In the past, the "War Cadre Corps" borrowed this campus and trained many young people who were effective on the battlefield during the war. Now, there are still a few troops stationed there, and there is "mutual respect" between the school and the military. The troops sometimes perform old operas and show movies in the evening, and the students also run over to "enjoy the show." The soldiers and the students are like brothers.

The road from Xiao Ximen to the school gate is being repaired, and a school bus is also being prepared to run into the city. A magnificent and antique school gate is planned to be built at the entrance, with the name of the school in golden characters, written by Mr. Yu Youren. Some people say that if "Xi Da" cannot obtain Mr. Yu's calligraphy for the school gate, no one else would dare to write it.

The 335 New Exchange Rate Creates a Tragicomic Scene

Even someone who is completely unrelated to commercial transactions can discover the most sensitive "news nose" by looking at the market quotations that are published daily for merchants, not by fiddling with an abacus, but from another angle.

In the past few days, the market situation in Xi'an has been obviously turbulent. The reasons are probably these:

The first, and the freshest and most stimulating one, is the government's announcement of the "335" new exchange rate. Most people in Xi'an did not know about this new measure until they saw the morning newspaper on the 19th, but the newspaper that day did not publish what the new exchange rate was until the next day (the 20th). It is said that Shanghai announced it at 10:00 AM that day, and some "well-informed people" here learned about it from the radio waves before 11:00 AM. Buying and selling is like warfare, and time, time, victory belongs to those who grasp time. Between those who know first and those who know later, and those who know later and those who don't know, we have seen many tragicomedies. According to rumors, some people made a huge profit that day, with eight or nine "zeros" at the end of the number. Of course, there were also those who lost.

The Bridge is Repaired Here, but the Rails are Torn Up There

The second reason for the turbulence in the Xi'an market is that the Longhai Railway, except for the section near Bian (Kaifeng), has been cut off by the Communist army. The impact of the Communist army's actions is greater than that of the incursion into southern Shaanxi. At the beginning of this month, because the Eighth Bridge between Shaanxi and Luoyang had been repaired, the Railway Bureau was preparing to implement a direct train service between Shaanxi and Luoyang by the end of the month. At that time, transportation operators and general merchants had great expectations. Because the opening of this bridge meant that railway transportation between Xi'an and Shanghai would be smooth, and the freight rates could be greatly reduced. A few days ago (before the Longhai Railway increased its fares), according to the pricing of the transportation company, it cost only 280 yuan per kilogram to transport goods from Shanghai to Zhengzhou, and only about 350 yuan to Luoyang. Based on this, after the entire railway line from Shanghai to Xi'an is opened, the freight rate per kilogram would not exceed 500 yuan. This would certainly be beneficial to general prices. Unfortunately, the bridge was repaired here, but the rails were overturned there, and many beautiful fantasies were shattered.

In recent years, more and more department stores from Shanghai have been transported here, and now that transportation is cut off, although there are large stocks, the prices will naturally rise. Affected by this are cloth, cotton fabrics, sundries, cosmetics, food, cigarettes, and all foreign goods that are transshipped through Shanghai.

The third reason is that the Longhai Railway adjusted its fares from the 16th, increasing passenger fares by 70% (more than 1,300 times higher than before the war!) and freight fares by 30%. "The wool comes from the sheep's back." When transportation costs increase, the selling price naturally increases.

Efforts to Mediate Achieve Results: Only Pushing Cars in the Mud

The 32nd Executive Group arrived in Xi'an at 3:00 PM on the 25th. The six members of the group departed from Laohekou by car at 6:00 AM that day. According to them, since arriving in Laohekou on the 16th, they have tried their best to contact Li Xiannian. The 9th Executive Group stationed in Laohekou has also tried their best, including dropping leaflets and letters from airplanes, but so far there have been no results. The 9th Group is scheduled to fly to Xi'an today. The 32nd Group will wait for the 9th Group to arrive before holding a joint meeting to continue mediation. They will then decide what to do next depending on the situation.

Yesterday afternoon, the 32nd Group hosted local reporters and gave a talk, explaining that their trip to Shaanxi was ordered by the three-member group in Nanjing to mediate the military conflict on the border between Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. They will report back to Nanjing on the progress of the mediation. Colonel White Russell, the American representative, said in a humorous tone, "The results of our efforts have only been to push cars in the mud." It is said that they encountered bad roads due to rain and their car was deeply mired in the mud and could not move forward, so they had to get out of the car to refuel and push it. Colonel White's words may have an underlying meaning.

### Commemorating Confucius' Birthday and Remembering Historical Sites

Today is the birthday anniversary of the Most Holy Teacher Confucius. We cannot help but recall that Confucius lived in the turbulent Spring and Autumn Period, and played a role in restoring order from chaos, and sought the happiness of human peace. In terms of academics, he did his best to teach, deleted the Book of Songs and the Book of Documents, edited the Records of Rituals, wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, and praised the Book of Changes. His teachings have not been altered for thousands of years, and are universally applicable. Now that we have reached the first anniversary of victory, the prospects for peace are still promising but elusive, and national construction is eager to proceed but cannot. It is appropriate to follow Confucius, so that the nation can achieve rejuvenation and culture can reach prosperity.

The hometown residence of Confucius is located slightly west of Qufu County. The Dacheng Hall has a height of 7 zhang 8 chi 6 cun, a width of 14 zhang 2 chi 7 cun, and a depth of 8 zhang 4 chi. The stone pillars in the front are all carved with dragons. The tiles are covered with yellow. In front is an open-air platform, surrounded by stone railings, with two layers and twelve steps in the middle and on the left and right. Inside the hall is a shrine to enshrine the divine tablet of the Most Holy, and the statue of the Holy One. Three li north of the county seat, facing the Zhu River and backing the Si River, the Historical Records says: Confucius was buried on the Si River north of the Lu city, and the Holy Tomb is sealed like a horse's back, the mound is one zhang two chi high, and ten steps wide north and south. In front of the tomb are two stone tablets. About ten steps south of the tomb is the tomb of Zisi, the grandson of Confucius, with two stone tablets, one saying "Tomb of Duke Shusheng of Yiguo" and the other saying "Tomb of the Third Generation Ancestor." There are two Weng Zhong in front, which are old objects from the Xuanhe period of the Song Dynasty. The forest on the left and right of the Holy Forest Archway is the forest, and the village in front is said to be Kongli.

### Sketches of Ningbo and Cixi

— Ningbo Report on the 22nd, Special Correspondent: Chu Yusheng

In Yuyao, we heard that Siming Mountain was a haven for bandits, so we decided to travel to the foot of Siming Mountain. At 7:00 AM, we took a large truck to the highway to the Shushan ferry. After walking a few dozen steps, we arrived at the Shushan ferry. During the enemy-puppet period, many forts were built there. This small ferry was the main route for the enemy-puppet guerrillas and the New Fourth Army to enter and exit during the war. Before our eyes was a large river, the Yao River, which led directly to Ningbo. A river also went vertically, named the Lubu River. We crossed the river to the opposite bank, which was the Lu Tomb Township of Yuyao. The fields along the way were connected to each other, the rice was lush, the trees were very dense, and the farmers were driving their oxen to work in the fields. The water-lifting equipment was lined up along the river bank, and the oxen were strong and clean, which made people feel very excited.

We proceeded along the Lubu River. The trees on the opposite bank stood like screens, and wildflowers showed off their beauty on the river bank, which was the most beautiful scenery in the fields. Several sedan chairs carried people past. These sedan chairs were very well-preserved, with glass windows and fine rattan chairs. I asked the sedan chair carriers why they had such good sedan chairs? He said, "These are prepared for people to get married." This shows the comfort of the local people. I really don't believe that this is an area where bandits roam.

After walking ten li, we arrived at Lubu Township, which is the gateway to Siming Mountain, that is, the foot of Siming Mountain. Siming Mountain is located between seven counties, covering a large area and with a magnificent terrain. Bandits commit crimes in the mountains, and adhere to the idea of "rabbits don't eat grass near their homes," so they often cross the Shushan ferry and roam. Therefore, Lu Tomb and Lu Ao Townships can still be safe and sound. It is said that these bandits look like ordinary people when they are not committing crimes, so it is impossible to distinguish them. We always thought that only seven points of politics and three points of military force could solve the problem smoothly. Only by making the people of Siming Mountain feel that our soldiers are amiable and respectable can we have a successful day in clearing the countryside.

After walking another ten li, we returned to the Shushan ferry, and then from the Shushan ferry to the highway. We drove to Cixi. As we approached Cixi City, we saw a pagoda, which looked very similar to the Leifeng Pagoda. When we arrived at the county seat, there were small roads inside the city, all paved with cement. The degree of destruction of the city by the enemy was lighter than that of Lin'an, Wukang and other counties, but the market was deserted, which made people feel that the vitality after the war was not easy to recover. The total cultivated area of ​​the county is 550,000 mu, and the population before the war was 300,000, but now it is only 260,000. The north produces more cotton, and the rest produces more rice. Mr. Chen Bulei, whose talents are famous in China, Mr. Chen Xunci, a famous historian, and Mr. Chen Xuyu, the editor-in-chief of this newspaper, are all from the west of Cixi. So Cixi can also be said to be a place where talents gather.

People who have traveled around Shanghai all know that the shipping companies that operate are the Sanbei Company. The so-called Sanbei refers to the north of Cixi, the north of Yuyao, and the north of Zhenhai. The late commercial tycoon Mr. Yu Qiaqing is from "Sanbei." The north ends of these three counties are connected together and are close to the ocean, so there is a separate name "Sanbei" as a place name.

Currently, the most serious threat to Cixi is the banditry in Siming Mountain. I heard many local elders say that if the bandits in Siming Mountain cannot be completely eliminated, Cixi will not be safe.

Ningbo City Area

After leaving Cixi, we drove to Ningbo. The road was flat all the way, and the car quickly reached its destination. This is where the five ports were forced to open for trade during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. The Jiangbei suburb of the city is the former concession, which was managed by the British. Most of the buildings in the city are modern buildings, and the roads are wide. There are also Outer Bund Road, Middle Bund Road, Zhongshan East Road, and Dongdu Road, all with asphalt pavement. It really has the form of a metropolis. Some people emphasize that Ningbo is a modern metropolis because it is adjacent to the East China Sea and only takes ten hours to reach Shanghai. There are seven large-scale factories such as Hefeng Yarn Factory and Taifeng Flour Factory, and more than 30 small factories and yarn factories. The braised bamboo shoots that are sold all over the country are produced by Rusheng Factory here. Even the only metropolis in the country, Shanghai, and the United Kingdom and the United States like to eat braised bamboo shoots. In terms of commerce, there are many money houses and jewelry stores in the Jiangxia Street area, and there are also many northern goods stores. Ningbo-style woodenware is also very famous. Ningbo lacquer is especially famous at home and abroad.

A Glimpse of the Fish Market

In terms of fisheries, there are more than 50 fish shops here. Now it has been reorganized into a fish market, and Shanghai has been designated as the first fish market by the central government, and Ningbo is the second fish market, which has changed the fish shops into brokers. Maintain the relationship between loans and unloading and buying. Now the fish market handles the seafood department and the customs declaration department, and acts as an agent for fishermen's customs declaration procedures. However, the fishermen do not come directly to sell, but after the purchase of ice-fresh ships, they are sold to the market. There are inevitably exploitative elements in this. Moreover, the fish market does not have a cold storage, and it relies entirely on the commercial cold storage company for cold storage. The fish market does not dare to collect more fish, and the fishing boats send them to the cold storage company, which creates another layer of obstacles. As for the organizers of the fish market, the official and commercial sectors are half and half, and the funds all rely on the fish shops to allocate a part for market use, one and a half points for salted fish, and two points for fresh fish, which can generally be maintained and there is still a surplus.

The Reality of Education

The population of the entire county before the war was more than 700,000, and now it is only 500,000. The total area of ​​the county is 551,147 square li, and the arable area is 2,066,799 mu. There is an effective full secondary school in the territory, which is divided into senior and junior high school departments, and was founded by Mr. Chen Bulei. There are more than 700 students. Those who apply to universities are always accepted, so it is famous in the Ningbo area. There are also Yin County Middle School, Ningbo Middle School, Zhedong Middle School, and Yongjiang Women's Middle School, all of which are full secondary schools. Each school has more than 500 students, and there are also Junan Junior High School and Zhengshi Junior High School, with about the same number of students. The school buildings are very good, and the facilities are also complete. The above can all show that it is a county that is qualified, substantial and sound. Therefore, in the years 1926 and 1927, it was established as a city. Later, due to the financial difficulties of the provincial government, the city was changed to a county, but the police station was still directly under the provincial government.

In the eastern area of ​​the territory, there is Dongqian Lake, which covers an area of ​​38,320 mu, which is the main source of farmland water conservancy for Yin County, Fenghua, and Zhenhai counties, benefiting more than 527,000 mu of farmland. The lake is surrounded by mountains, with beautiful scenery and clear lake water. Villages are everywhere, but in recent years, they have become more and more polluted, and reeds have grown everywhere, showing a desolate scene.

Reviving Ningbo

In fact, Ningbo in recent years is far inferior to what it was before. Due to high costs, industries have either closed down or reduced their scale. Due to the dumping of foreign goods and the reduction of purchasing power, commerce is also showing extreme depression. The public prostitutes in Ningbo later had three grades, with 32 first-class prostitutes, 18 second-class prostitutes, and 17 third-class prostitutes. There were 94 first-class prostitutes, 35 second-class prostitutes, and 23 third-class prostitutes. Now they have also increased proportionally.

The museum and library have also been destroyed, and many school buildings of public and private schools have also been damaged. Beggars and vagrants are rampant in the market.

Reviving Ningbo is in the planning and desire of the provincial government and local people. The most important task at present is to develop the fish market in the economic aspect, and then improve the processing and manufacturing of braised bamboo shoots and lacquer. The construction of water conservancy in Dongqian Lake is also an urgent task. In the spiritual aspect, we should promote academic and cultural activities and improve social customs.

### Compulsory Sales of Party and National Flags is Clearly Extortion; The Central Propaganda Department Has Repeatedly Ordered Investigation and Prohibition

We received your newspaper's letter No. 149, regarding the reader's letter reporting that some people in Gaochun and Piaoyong counties are impersonating the Ministry's name to forcibly sell national flags, and requesting investigation and reference, etc., and attaching the original documents. Upon approval of this, the production and sale of national and party flags are only required to comply with the regulations on printing and dyeing colors and sizes. Any merchant can freely operate. This ministry has not granted exclusive rights to anyone, nor has it established a national and party flag sales headquarters and distribution points in various places, and sent people to various places to force people to buy them. This ministry previously reported that some unscrupulous people in Changshu, Wuxi, and other places had impersonated this ministry to solicit wealth, and ordered various places to investigate and prohibit them. On June 12th and 13th of this year, we published an announcement in newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to solemnly declare this, in order to prevent people from being deceived. Now that we are informed that the same incident has occurred in Gaochun and Piaoshui counties, in addition to sending telegrams to the local party and government agencies to investigate and deal with it strictly, we have returned the original attachments accordingly. Please investigate, and we hope that this letter will be published. Sincerely, Shen Bao Newspaper Office. (Central Propaganda Department, August 24)

### Answering Reader's Legal Questions

(1) Termination of an Engagement

Jin Dongzhao asks: When I was eighteen, my parents arranged an engagement with a Miss Feng from the same village. I strongly opposed it at the time, but because I was still studying, my parents made all the decisions, and my opposition was ineffective. Now I am twenty-one and want to cancel the engagement, but I am unclear about the legal procedures. I have several questions and would like your lawyer to answer them: (1) Can I terminate an engagement that I did not agree to, and what are the procedures? (2) Can I demand compensation from the other party when terminating the engagement? (3) Is it illegal for me not to attend the wedding? (4) Would I be committing bigamy if I became engaged to someone else?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, you can argue that the engagement is invalid; (2) You need concrete evidence to claim compensation; (3) According to Article 915 of the Civil Code, an engagement cannot be forcibly enforced; (4) It does not constitute bigamy.

(2) Repairing a House

Lin Xuan asks: In Shanghai, after the rent has increased 140 times, is the repair of the house the responsibility of the landlord or the tenant? For example, if the house is in a low-lying area and is often flooded, causing the floorboards to rot, the cost of replacing them would be enormous for the tenant and beyond their means. Moreover, it would be difficult to take the new floorboards away upon leaving the property. What would be a fair way to handle this? Please advise.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Unless there are special circumstances, it should be handled in accordance with Articles 423 and 430 of the Civil Code.

(3) Debt Dispute

Jinmin asks: In the 25th year of the Republic, I borrowed five hundred yuan in legal tender from Mr. Cheng (with a contract). I have been paying interest annually. Now the creditor wants me to repay the debt based on the price of rice at the time of the loan. (1) Does the central government have any laws regarding repaying loans based on price indexes? (2) How much legal tender would be legal to repay now for the original five hundred yuan?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] It should be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Recovery.

(4) Recovering a House

Ji Yihe asks: I have two legal questions and would like your lawyer to answer them: (1) Is a house sale valid if it was made under duress during the enemy-puppet period? If the original owner wants to recover the property, what procedures should they follow? Has the Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Bureau ever issued an explicit order stating that sales made during the enemy-puppet period can be recovered by the original owner? (2) There is a distinction between security deposits and rental fees. Suppose a house was rented to Mr. A in the 23rd year of the Republic, with a security deposit of only a few hundred yuan. Now the landlord wants to terminate the lease, but the tenant says that the security deposit must be returned based on the current price of rice, which would amount to several million yuan. Is this legal?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) If there is concrete evidence of coercion, you can request relief from the Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Bureau. (2) It should be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Recovery.

### How to Choose a Good Husband

— Zou Dangchang

Every young woman (or man) has an ideal, a sweet ideal. An ideal of sweet love, an ideal of suitable and harmonious married life. But when they actually experience it, what they are faced with is always reality. Reality is not as good as the ideal, so suicide, depression, and all kinds of problems arise. In fact, this is the most foolish thing. Because you have too good an ideal, you cannot withstand unexpected blows. Why do you have to be like this! As long as you have identified your goal, and are not changed by the environment or bent by obstacles, then you determine the conditions for your spouse in your heart, and you will never fail. Below are a few conditions, I hope you can really think about them:

1. Clarify the purpose of marriage. The first thing we need to know is that marriage is not for the satisfaction of sexual desire, but many people make this mistake. They mostly think that once a woman gets married, it is like a task has been completed successfully, and then she just needs to be placed there, treated as something to be watched or played with. This is an unacceptable idea.

2. Do you and your partner have the same interests? We can see a very active man who marries a silent woman. The man likes to move around, and his mouth is like a river. Once he starts talking, he can't stop. His interests are multifaceted; but the lady often sits there for one or two hours without saying a word. So the consequences for them can be imagined. During the period of love, one side may be willing to compromise, but once married, if you want to go east, but I want to go west, then the cracks will deepen, and the feelings will deteriorate day by day, and the consequences are truly unspeakable. Exceptions are very few.

3. When choosing your permanent partner from among your boyfriends, you should pay attention to their age. His age is best to be four or five years older than you, because women are very easy to look old. When a woman has her first child, you can find that she has aged a lot invisibly. At the same time, we can also see that when a man and a woman are both forty years old, when they stand together, the woman must look older. So when they go out together, he often feels a little unmatched, so when you choose a friend, you must pay attention to this point.

4. During the period of male and female friendship, most people will never show their true colors. Men with good tempers certainly don't need to be mentioned, but even men with extremely bad tempers and who turn their backs on others will not show any rudeness at that time. He will pretend to be kind and flattering to you in every possible way. If you are not careful, you will fall into his trap, and you will not have time to regret it. Therefore, the longer you are friends with him, the better, because after a long time, the two people become warm, then each person is easy to show their original shape, so you can determine what his temper is like. We often see a couple, during the period of love, he is all kinds of tender, but after marriage, he may beat and kick his wife, and insult her in every possible way.

5. The period between engagement and marriage is a relatively sweet period, but it is best for you to get married within a year and a half. After you are engaged, you must not delay the years and waste your youth. Because once a woman's youth passes, it is not easy to attract men. At the same time, I have also seen many engaged lovers, after being engaged, the two are separated, so the man has another love, and the beautiful marriage is destroyed by a third party, because men are relatively easy to change their minds. Of course, it is also very common for men to change their minds after marriage, but you need to know that you will not want to be separated for a long time after marriage, and after all, he has one more obstacle, and divorce is more difficult than terminating a contract in law.

### Lemon Cake

— Mo Ping

Let me introduce a exquisite dessert, lemon cake. Now I will write down its method below.

Ingredients: Four ounces of flour, one and a half ounces of celery powder, four ounces of sugar, two eggs, half a peeled lemon.

Method: First crack the eggs into a bowl and mix well with chopsticks. In another large magnetic basin, place the flour, pour the eggs into the magnetic basin, add the celery powder, sugar, and half a peeled lemon (the lemon must be crushed into powder), mix well with your hands. After mixing, take it out and place it on a flat board or table and press it into a large cake shape. Then place it in a pot and steam it for about an hour, then you can take it out of the pot. Then thickly smear milk oil on a baking mold, place it on the stove, and when the iron plate is slightly hot, place the steamed cake on the baking mold, and cover it with a thin tin lid. Bake it for about thirty minutes, and half of the steam contained in the cake will dry. Open the lid and look at it, the flour in the bottom half will be dry and loose; the half near the lid must be wet and sticky. Take another piece of baking iron plate, apply butter once, and cover the cake as a lid. (No need for a thin tin lid) Hold the upper and lower two iron plates with both hands, turn the cake over and bake again, until half an hour has passed, and all the wet steam in the cake is gone, then the cake will be dry, loose and fragrant, and you can take the cake and the iron plate and place it. After it has cooled thoroughly, use a knife to cut it into squares. Its taste is sweet and delicious, and it is both loose and fragrant. It is most suitable for gifts.

### Things Young Women Should Know When Making Friends

— Ai Juan

(1) Maintain your dignity and avoid frivolous behavior, especially towards new and unfamiliar members of the opposite sex.

(2) If a new male acquaintance sends you a cheesy love letter, asks you to go to the movies, or go dancing, he must have bad intentions. You should pay special attention to him, and if necessary, resolutely break off the relationship.

(3) You should have the courage to turn your back on those who are malicious and behave improperly. Consider the requests of boyfriends carefully, and have the courage to refuse him and not be afraid to offend him. Otherwise, if you agree to everything, he will step by step lead you into his trap.

(4) Do not associate with friends of the same or opposite sex who live a romantic and dissolute life. Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black. If you fall and lose your footing, and your reputation is ruined, it will be too late to regret it.

(5) Those shiny-haired and shiny-shoed people who chase like mad dogs on the road and in entertainment venues are mostly "troublemakers" and "cheaters". You must not pay attention to them. Their purpose is clearly to deceive women. Those who more politely ask for your name in order to start a conversation are not necessarily gentlemen either. In short, do not pay attention to strangers.

(6) The psychology of men seeking female friends is to use friendship as a pretext to talk about love. None of them just want friendship. Therefore, at the beginning of making friends, you should begin to observe the other person's temperament, character, and knowledge. If you feel that the other person does not meet your standards, but the other person is warmly expressing their love to you, then you should state your true intentions and make them give up this idea and only maintain friendship with you.

(7) If you are already in love or engaged, when going out with other male friends, there should be at least three people, and it is best if one of them is the same sex. This can avoid criticism from interested parties and prevent tragedies caused by suspicion from your lover.

(8) Do not completely abandon your parents and make friends in secret. Especially the person you are in love with, you should at least let your parents know, and listen to their criticism of him as a reference for yourself.

### The Wonderful Use of "One! Two! Three!"

— Qing

The other day, at my aunt's house, I saw a strange thing happen. When my fifth and sixth cousins were arguing fiercely, suddenly their second elder brother ran over and shouted "One... Two..." as if chanting a spell. Immediately, the two children stopped talking, silently—although they were still pouting—and walked away. Later, in order to understand this matter, I specifically asked my aunt what the reason was. She was kind enough to explain it to me in detail. After listening, I felt that my aunt's method was a wonderful method of child education, and therefore I dare not be selfish, but write it out and offer it to the readers of this column for reference. Below is my aunt's conversation.

When a group of children—especially those under ten years old—are playing happily, it is not easy to suddenly stop their activities, unless you use harsh words or scolding, or even beatings to be effective. However, harsh words, scolding, and beatings are not allowed by child educators, and they do hinder the development of children's physical and mental health.

I remember about fourteen or fifteen years ago, my eldest daughter was only eleven or twelve years old. One day, four children were playing a game of tag, running from upstairs to downstairs, from the courtyard to the room. At that time, I was writing an article and had to stop their game; so I called them to stop in a kind and pleasant way, but they ignored me. At that time, I originally wanted to use intimidation or scold them, but when I saw those innocent and lovely little faces and cheerful little eyes, I could not bear to be too severe. As a result, I still humbly asked them to come over and listen to me.

At the moment when they walked over, I invented my child education method. I made three rules for them and said amiably; "Now I want to write an article, but you are making too much noise, so I only have this method, first let you play to your heart's content again, and when you have almost played enough, I will shout 'One' aloud, at this time you can still ignore me, but when I shout 'Two', you must be ready to stop, if I shout 'Three', and you do not stop, then I will blame you and punish you. Do you understand?" Probably because of the novelty, they all raised their small hands to show their approval, so I implemented the method as planned. After a dozen minutes, I said "One", and they really ignored me. I was a little suspicious. Fortunately, after seven or eight minutes, I shouted "Two" again, and they all really stopped moving and stopped playing.

From then on, this "One! Two! Three!" became my family law. Later, I had six children, so I gave this comical family law, in front of the six children, gave this power to my eldest daughter and second son, asking their four younger siblings to respect this order.

Regarding this matter, I feel very proud, because my method has never failed once. Every time, they all stop moving before I shout "Three!"—the so-called movement includes fighting, quarreling, making trouble... all kinds of situations. Moreover, this order will only be effective if I designate it to anyone. I remember once, a friend wanted to test my words, he also gave a "One! Two! Three!" order, as a result, not only did they ignore him, but they also laughed at him; but when I officially announced that this friend also had the same power, they obediently followed. This is also what I considered when making the law, afraid that others would abuse it to curb the innocence of children.

Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn)

### Collapse (Novel)

— Yang Mou

The small attic room was exceedingly silent and still.

Outside in the back alley, the loud conversations of neighbors, the teasing between men and women, the laughter of children, and someone humming a popular song, ..., seemed very out of sync with the atmosphere in the room.

This was an attic room on the third floor, cramped and narrow, mostly filled with old, dusty furniture. Illuminated by a dim fifteen-candlepower lamp, the owner, a man who appeared to be around thirty, wearing tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, with a flat-top haircut and a round face, was shirtless and marking papers, his face seemingly covered in the hardships of life's struggles.

He kept waving a palm-leaf fan with one hand, but could not stop the beads of sweat from constantly seeping out.

Looking at the large pile of exam papers on the desk, Shengsheng couldn't help but let out a slight sigh:

"This life," he muttered with a hint of resentment.

His mind conjured up images of friends and classmates who had gotten rich, driving cars and living in Western-style houses.

Unconsciously, he put down his pen. He raised his head, looking at the ceiling stained with yellow watermarks, envy and jealousy welling up together.

Clenching his lips with his teeth, he tried hard to control himself. The faces of young, lively students flashed through his mind, and he quickly picked up his pen again.

"Shengsheng, Shengsheng."

A burst of urgent knocking and loud calls came from the back door.

The voice seemed a little shaky, making it very unfamiliar to Shengsheng, and he couldn't recognize who was in such a hurry.

He had just stood up when the back door creaked open, probably the landlady from the ground floor, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps on the stairs.

"Oh, it's you."

Shengsheng could never have expected that the person standing before him, in such a flustered state, was Lan Jun.

Lan Jun was known as a very active figure in the Shanghai market, young, generous, with slicked-back hair and a sharp white suit, but tonight he was acting out of character, restless and uneasy.

He held out his hands, shrugged his shoulders, and Lan Jun sat on the edge of the bed with a bitter smile.

"Shengsheng, I've come to say goodbye."

Shengsheng couldn't imagine what this was all about. He stared blankly at Lan Jun, unable to utter a word.

"Well, I don't have much else to lose. I can talk for a while. This time, on the government bonds, even my family and reputation have been swept away. Now, well, there's only me left, and countless debts outside..."

Shengsheng began to understand.

Shengsheng and Lan Jun were from the same hometown and had been very good friends since childhood. As soon as they graduated from junior high school in their hometown, the flames of war dragged them into the vortex of the times.

After fleeing from their hometown to Shanghai, they remained like-minded friends. However, at the starting point of their careers, due to differences in environment and interests, they slowly parted ways.

Shengsheng struggled to get into middle school and then university, while Lan Jun started working as a black marketeer under the protection of the enemy at the train station.

Shengsheng advised Lan Jun, but it wasn't a matter of words; it was a test of real strength. Besides this path, Lan Jun himself and his family had no room to survive. With a fragile will, Lan Jun silently stepped into that world.

When Shengsheng graduated from university, struggling with no way out and working as a teacher in a private middle school, Lan Jun had already left the black market and was specializing in hoarding goods, accumulating considerable wealth.

"Lan Jun, this isn't a solution. You have to plan for your future!"

Shengsheng had advised Lan Jun like this several times.

"I think so too, but let's talk about it when it's brighter. Right now, what other way is there?"

Lan Jun always answered in the same way.

However, Lan Jun's extravagant lifestyle had sometimes caused Shengsheng to feel a secret envy, although he always refused when Lan Jun offered to help him.

"Shengsheng, don't worry, I've also been educated. I won't do anything too outrageous."

This was a phrase Lan Jun often used to comfort Shengsheng. Yes, he, a young boy who had only received a junior high school education, had to shoulder the heavy burden of his family. How could one demand more from him?

With the victory, Shengsheng warmly shook hands with Lan Jun. They could still move forward on the same path.

Lan Jun was also very excited. He found a vocational school, settled his family, and sincerely wanted to study for a few years to make up for the indelible deficiencies in his life.

Later, however, Lan Jun dropped out of school, after only a month, it seemed. He went back to his business.

Shengsheng asked Lan Jun, but he didn't answer.

Finally, he blurted out:

"What good is it to work hard like you!"

These words naturally contained some of his disappointment, and Shengsheng couldn't say a word in response.

After that, it was said that Lan Jun became even more active and extravagant, with cars, Western-style houses, and so on.

However, Lan Jun and Shengsheng became relatively estranged.

One lived in wealth, the other in poverty.

They were still friends, they sympathized with each other, they envied each other, and they cared about each other.

Shengsheng understood that Lan Jun had fallen from heaven all the way to hell. He sympathized with his situation, but couldn't think of a solution.

"You still don't rest..."

Shengsheng wanted to blame him, but seeing his lost expression, he couldn't help but feel a wave of pity.

"I know, I know, but after mingling in society so much during the war, how can I go back and study with young students? I couldn't stand it for even a month, so I came out. I wanted to find something to do, something good, but it still ended up like this. Sigh, myself..."

A stream of complaints, yes, a stream of complaints.

"What to do now?"

"There's nothing left. My family has all been sent back to our hometown. The house and furniture have been sold. There's only me left. I can't stay in Shanghai anymore. I don't know where to go next."

"Too fast," Shengsheng sighed unconsciously.

"Yes, too fast. One always reaps what one sows. For years, I've been laughing at you. Now I realize that your life and your work are long-lasting and eternal."

"No, no, no..."

Shengsheng was embarrassed and his emotions were confused.

Lan Jun had already stood up, tightly gripping Shengsheng's hand.

"Shengsheng, we may see each other again, or we may never see each other again. I will always be grateful for your concern in the past, and I will always envy your life! I'm leaving, leaving."

His hand loosened, he left, pulling the attic door shut behind him. A burst of hurried footsteps on the stairs. Shengsheng forgot to see him off.

He saw a figure, as if gradually fading and receding into the distance.

He collapsed onto the bed, a friend. He couldn't help but wish him well.

### A Visit to Liyuan Garden

— Zhong Yuan

Everyone says the roses in Liyuan Garden are beautiful, but on the day Xiuming invited me to play there, I didn't expect it to be right after a rainstorm and hurricane, and the roses had all withered.

Next to a desolate little thatched pavilion, Xiuming found a relatively smooth and dry stone bench, gently pushed me towards it, sat down beside me, and said, "I didn't actually invite you to see any roses, but just wanted to find an opportunity to talk to you."

Xiuming spoke very softly. That gentle, slightly resolute voice was still as clear and pleasant as it had been nine years ago. Her long arm was draped over my shoulder, and a few slender fingers were playing with the hair at the back of my neck. She continued in a low voice: "I want to tell you about some of my pain, the pain that has been brewing in my heart for the past six months..."

"You're in pain?" I asked.

"Yes, I'm in pain..." she replied.

I curiously turned my head to look at Xiuming's face. That pointed face was still as delicate and beautiful as it had been back then. I looked at her left hand hanging on my shoulder again. That lovely little hand was also no different from back then. But now, on the fourth finger, there was a small white gold diamond ring, which hadn't been there nine years ago.

Could there be some dissatisfaction in her marriage?

I really couldn't think of any reason to dare suspect that. Such a talented and beautiful lady, a university graduate, who had experienced countless mountains and rivers, traveled all over half of China, and had contributed and worked for her country in the midst of gunfire and flames. Finally, with her incredibly sharp eyes, she had selected a talented, affectionate, rich, and extremely well-placed son-in-law from a thick register of suitors. Could there be any dissatisfaction?

No way! I thought to myself and said to her:

"I heard that your life is extremely happy!"

"Happy is indeed happy, but!"

Saying that, Xiuming's eyes suddenly turned strangely, revealing a terrible light. This light contained sadness, resentment, anger, and curses...

"To tell you the truth, I was completely fooled. It turns out he already had someone in the occupied areas..." She suddenly changed the subject and gave me a strange smile: "But now, he's divorced from that woman!"

"Isn't it good that you're divorced? What pain do you still have?" I said.

"But even though we're divorced, that hateful woman is still haunting me!"

"How is she haunting you?"

"She follows us everywhere. We go to Shanghai, she goes to Shanghai. We go to Nanjing, she goes to Nanjing. Now we've come back to our hometown for the summer, and she's come again. And that woman, although she's also very young, is like a crazy woman. Every time she sees us, she just stares blankly. She stares whether we ignore her, glare at her, or scold her. It's simply impossible to deal with..."

Xiuming went on and on. I listened quietly. It was getting late, and I was coughing a bit. Xiuming stopped talking and said, "You're tired. Let's go back."

I was indeed a bit tired, but afraid of neglecting my old friend whom I hadn't seen for a long time, I accompanied her on a circuit inside Liyuan before leaving. She said a lot more about that woman, but I didn't listen. I just silently gazed at the roses that had been ravaged by the hurricane and rainstorm, and felt sad in my heart.

Leaving Liyuan Garden, Xiuming asked me to come back and talk another day. I didn't agree. She asked me why. I said, "I'm afraid of seeing those poor roses!"

I really didn't want to visit Liyuan Garden again, and I didn't even want to see that beautiful and lovely friend again.

### Highland Goddess (Selection of World Famous Paintings)

— By Foss (1868-1904)

Collection of the Tate Museum, London

Foss (C.W. Furse) was born in Staines. He studied painting early in his life but had a weak constitution. He was often ill during his studies and eventually died at the age of thirty-six. The painting "Highland Goddess" depicts his wife standing proudly in the wind, and the picture is filled with a spacious and peaceful atmosphere.

### Can't Leave Shanghai

— Xie Zi

Recently, I met a friend who said he was in a very bad mood. Since his father's death, because he had some family affairs to take care of, he hadn't been out of the house for more than a month. As soon as he stayed in the house, he seemed to be stuck. He was rarely at home, but this time he had been at home for more than two months, not stepping out the door. The complexity of family affairs made him embarrassed. His mother consulted him on everything, and the eyes of the whole family were focused on him, hoping that he would have a solution, but he had no solution at all. He couldn't get interested in anything. Even when his girlfriend came to see him, he felt nothing, as if he had forgotten love, as if he had never loved. His depression was multifaceted, and none of those facets could be resolved. He told me about his recent daily life: he didn't get up until after eleven o'clock in the morning. After washing up, it was already time for lunch. Sometimes he got up even later. People asked him to eat, but he said, "You eat first." After he was done, he would move the dishes into the room, pour himself a drink, and eat alone. After eating, he would casually look at the newspaper, but never read a book. Sometimes friends would come to see him—not any friends, but friends who lived nearby with nothing to do. They would chat about everything under the sun until four or five o'clock. Maybe they would buy some wine, prepare a few dishes, and eat for three or four hours. After his friends left, he would turn on the radio and listen to the broadcast, from pop songs to news reports, Beijing opera, Yue opera, and even drum ballads and local operas, listening to everything. As long as it was continuous sound, as long as it was sound that would make him forget everything about himself, he would keep listening, listening until after two o'clock in the morning. That was how he spent his day. Day after day, he felt extremely depressed, but he was helpless. To him, his family was like a depressing cave.

I said, "If you go on a trip to a distant place, it might have a good effect on your mind and body."

He said, "That's exactly what I'm thinking. If I could take a close girlfriend and spend this summer in Qingdao, how happy that would be! Get up early in the morning and go to the beach to breathe fresh air, or rather, to breathe in the vigor of the dawn world. I've always thought that Qingdao has a poetic atmosphere. I also like swimming. I can wash away the filth in the cool sea water. In the evening, go to the ballroom to listen to music. The soft music combined with the tide of the seashore must be especially lovely… That way, my body can slowly get better, and my mood will gradually become regular. But I don't have enough money, and I don't have that kind of status. This is just a fantasy."

"Then going to your old home in Suzhou would also be good, it's better than staying here."

"Suzhou?" He looked at me with a wry smile and said, "Just thinking about Suzhou gives me a headache. Looking around, it's always that small circle. There's no place to play, and there's no one to talk to. By eight o'clock in the evening, the whole of Suzhou is silent. I prefer the night, but everyone is asleep. If you're the only one who's not asleep, even making a little noise will surprise people. In short, in Suzhou, there's no place to look for even anesthetization."

From his words, it can be seen that he yearned for a vast and open world, while still being attached to Shanghai, attached to the prosperity here, attached to the enjoyment of the sights, sounds, and tastes here. Although he cursed Shanghai, saying that he didn't feel comfortable staying here, in reality, his curses were like a mother scolding her child, still loving him in her heart. His yearning for Qingdao was also just a yearning for vastness and openness. He didn't realize how vague and distant that was.

Except for thorough urban dwellers, no one can be completely satisfied with the city. Except for thorough country folk, no one can leave it without any attachment. We live in the city, immersed in the city, often only seeing its troubling side, and forgetting its loveliness. Once we think of leaving it, all of its lovely points are exposed. If we go to the countryside, the first thing we feel is inconvenience. There are no electric lights or running water. Stepping out the door, the roads are rugged and the scenery is desolate, making us feel even more uncomfortable. This is still the simplest. In our daily lives, we inevitably feel cramped everywhere, because all humans have a tendency to be gregarious. The love of bustling prosperity and the adherence to dazzling human civilization are also one of our natures. Leaving the city is like leaving humanity. That feeling of loneliness and desolation creates resentment in our hearts. I remember a Japanese person saying, "I can't bear to leave Shanghai, I can't bear to leave the women of Shanghai." This is not a simple witty remark, but it actually comes from the heart. However, we still yearn for all distant places, because distance makes them vague and therefore perfect, as if as long as we go to a distant place, everything can be resolved and everything can be set aside. But in reality, Qingdao isn't necessarily better than Suzhou. Suzhou is also a famous paradise. However, he experienced the life of Suzhou and therefore lost his yearning. Losing his yearning, Suzhou's mystery was also lost. If he had always lived in the north, he might be yearning for this gentle and charming water town of Jiangnan, just as he is yearning for Qingdao now. But once he achieved his goal, everything would be completely different.

This kind of yearning for vastness and openness can be said to be a poetic quality, a dissatisfaction with reality. It is restless and unstable, like a giant eagle soaring freely in the sky. If a person takes a trip around the world, perhaps every place will be lovely, but if you asked him to stay there forever, no place would be perfect. He doesn't want to be overwhelmed by the flood of materialism, because he has a soaring soul. Yet, he also can't give up the prosperity of the city, because he is passionate.

"I think you should still stay here," I said. "Take a trip when you have the chance. People like you, and me too, we can't leave Shanghai."

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 15

"Ah—uh!" A kind of strangely ugly and disgusting calling sound made people feel numb in the nerves. This money-grubbing guy standing beside me, called loudly and gesticulated towards another sentry post on the north side of the hillside, thinking that knowing his identity wouldn't solve our problem, so he was looking for someone to escort us to see the superior officer.

"106th Division, Hirasaka Unit, 131st Regiment, 3rd Squad, Private First Class ××." I had already read their unit numbers clearly. I remembered that a few days ago, this unit was still gathering in the country. But now they were already here taking action.

The so-called superior officer was a squad leader. People from Shanghai curse others as "pig brutes." In my imagination, this pig brute should have a low-sloping forehead, nostrils turned up to the sky, and a protruding lower jaw, so that his lips couldn't cover his big front teeth. At first glance, you could think of the posture of "bared fangs and brandished claws." If a pig brute is like this, then this deputy squad leader happened to fit the model of this standard pig brute, only adding two big gold teeth, emitting a dazzling yellow light.

"I ought to inquire about the department Your Excellency serves first, I am very sorry for being impolite."

I don't know why, I suddenly thought of the "Pigsy Seeks a Bride" I saw at the Shanghai Grand Theatre, that bridegroom; wasn't he also twisting and pinching, learning to act like a person, making two or three sentences of speech that were neither fish nor fowl?

Our plan was not to use the small railway or military vehicles to go straight to Beiping, because we wanted to maintain not letting anyone know our whereabouts. Otherwise, we would have already arrived in Beiping; because the sign of the Continental General Staff Headquarters could ask any party for convenient transportation.

"We should use the fifteenth method!" I had already made up my mind:

"The department is the Imperial Japanese Army Ministry General Staff Headquarters Imperial Army Continental Operations Department General Staff Headquarters; my position is Major-level Special Commissioner ×××× of the General Staff Headquarters Special Operations; this trip is a military secret, impossible to tell you, sorry for being impolite."

When speaking to at least a junior officer, your eyes should be looking at the sky, or the ceiling. This is the style of "turning a blind eye to people." At this time, I always maintained this style—hypocritical, arrogant, cunning, treacherous, fierce, and an exaggeratedly crazy style.

The wine, Changxindian Bai Gan, Japanese Authentic, Shanghai "Beer"; dishes; chicken, duck, canned sardines; and Beiping cantaloupe, hawthorn sugar, etc. No one knows where this enjoyment came from, how it was obtained, even though it was only a small regiment.

At this time, I could only patiently enjoy his offering. Little Tiger used the disguise of "Manchukuo" Anyang Special Agent and wolfed down the food in a very happy but also very alert manner. From this child's eyes, you can see two points; he didn't fail to see that the Japanese devils hated his gluttony so much that their teeth were itching, but they couldn't stop him; so he was happy to eat to his heart's content, while also expressing "Eating this bastard's food, serves you right for being in pain, who told you to provoke me?"

Several times I told this pig brute that I had urgent official business and had to get to the city; but his reason was difficult to refute;

"Replying to the commissioner, if Your Excellency had not condescended to visit my humble tent, walking there would mean only arriving in the city late at night. Taking this highway, you must first get to Dahui Factory, five or six kilometers, Dahui Factory crosses the Yongding River to Tiancun, about eleven or twelve kilometers, and then to Xizhimen, which is another nearly ten kilometers. The small roads are even more difficult to travel. It is better to wait until it gets dark—actions are more free—have subordinates use automobiles to travel along my army's defense line to the nearest stronghold to the city, a total of only one or two hours, and you can reach the city walls." He also spread out a map to prove that his plan was clever, although he was already ninety-nine percent drunk.

When getting in the car, I turned my back to the two Japanese drivers and that pig brute deputy squad leader, and gave Little Tiger an emergency warning code, a gesture that a smart child could understand. Opening [the door], Little Tiger and I sat in the car, and that drunken pig brute sat in the front with the driver. After traveling less than a mile, that guy suddenly ordered the car to stop, got out of the car, and apologized to me, asking to sit in the back compartment, saying that it could protect me more thoroughly.

### The Tragedy on Bi Xun Road

— Shao Fu

Please Respond, Municipal Government

There's a popular Shanghai curse, "to die unjustly," similar in meaning to "plague-ridden." Literally, it means to die wronged or to die aggrieved. Naturally, it carries the sense of "not worth it" or "undeserved," with a hint of regret and sympathy. However, when this curse is used, it often contains the indignant sentiment of blaming the person for deserving to die or being unlucky.

The original source of "to die unjustly" comes from motor vehicle accidents. Later, it gradually became a specific term for the wronged souls under the wheels. At that time, the Mixed Court in the concessions showed no pity for pedestrians who died due to violations of traffic regulations. The punishment was merely a fine of tens of dollars for the driver. This method was considered correct in alerting pedestrians to urban traffic rules, preventing them from walking on the streets arbitrarily without observing public order. But it also had its drawbacks, easily fostering arrogance in drivers who considered manslaughter merely a matter of spending a few dollars. Hence, the saying that the streets were like the mouths of tigers.

However, today, on the streets of Shanghai, not only do outsiders unfamiliar with traffic regulations find it difficult to move, but even citizens who strictly adhere to the Municipal Government's pedestrian instructions have the chance of becoming "wronged dead" at any moment. Everyone talks about tigers changing color, viewing going out as a long journey. If the Municipal Government does not consider a solution to this serious phenomenon, the 4.7 million people will be unable to understand the Municipal Government for the sake of their safety.

Not to mention distant events, yesterday witnessed an absurd and most tragic scene: the wife and children of the late Martyr Zhang Yongchun, former member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, were run over and killed by a U.S. Army hospital medic's car on the sidewalk of Bi Xun Road. It's not because the deceased was the principal of a municipal elementary school or the family of the late Martyr Zhang Yongchun, former member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, that we are paying special attention to this matter. Rather, it's because the deceased met with an accident on the sidewalk and because such automobile accidents have been occurring incessantly recently. We, the ordinary citizens without cars, cannot but feel that our personal safety is not guaranteed, that we are likely to be killed at any time, that we are not willing to die unjustly in such a muddled manner. We ask the Municipal Government to give us security!

The Bi Xun Road tragedy demands an explanation!

In addition, we want to ask:

1. How are driver's licenses issued? What are the driver management rules? Do military vehicles require driver's licenses? Are drivers subject to management?

2. Is there a standard limit to the number of vehicles allowed? Can they increase without limit, without considering road area?

3. Has a method for military vehicles traveling in urban areas been researched?

4. Is the Municipal Government satisfied with the current traffic situation? (Cars are parked haphazardly, the timing of traffic lights is not standardized…)

Regarding traffic issues, we have repeatedly explained, because we have no other choice. We also deeply know the efforts and difficulties of the Municipal Government, but until safety and convenience are achieved, please forgive us for never giving up on this issue.

### Goals for Establishing Teacher's Day: (1) Improve Treatment, (2) Guarantee Status, (3) Enhance Cultivation.

— Zheng Fan

First, let me tell you about the origin of "Teacher's Day." It was in the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. On June 6th of that year, more than 300 teachers from Beijing and Shanghai, in order to consolidate their status, improve their treatment, and strive for self-cultivation, agreed to gather at National Central University to hold a meeting. After unanimous agreement, they decided to make that day "Teacher's Day" every year. It was not until August 15th of the 28th year of the Republic [1939] that the Executive Yuan's 427th decision meeting decided to change Teacher's Day to Confucius's birthday on August 27th every year, the reason being "to deeply imply the meaning of admiring the ultimate sage amidst the people's happiness and well-being."

From this, we can see the goals for establishing Teacher's Day: first, to improve teachers' treatment; second, to guarantee teachers' status; and third, to enhance teachers' cultivation.

Teacher's Day has reached its 16th anniversary today. Have these three goals been achieved?

Let's first talk about teachers' treatment. The meager treatment of teachers has been "the case since ancient times," and it is even worse today. The cry for "improving treatment" has lasted for sixteen years, and the salaries teachers receive decrease year by year. You know the treatment of ordinary elementary school teachers in Shanghai today, but you may not know what kind of lives rural teachers in the interior are living. Rural elementary school teachers currently receive a monthly salary of 20,000 yuan, which is delayed by as much as three months. Before the war, education funding accounted for 20% of the budget, but today, after countless cries of "education first," education funding has fallen to only 4.7% of the budget. Teachers' lives are unstable. Words like "building the nation by prioritizing education" are all "empty words!"

In Nanjing, a teacher was so poor that he had no clothes to wear and went to class wearing his wife's cheongsam. He worked as a laborer at night to supplement the family's expenses. News of teachers committing family suicide due to the pressure of life has been spreading throughout the country. In Shanghai, a teacher from a certain school stole a sum of money from a colleague, escaped to the West Lake in Hangzhou, and had a period of extravagant fun before committing suicide. Today's newspapers are filled with teachers' cries, and every corner is filled with teachers' sighs and groans! Isn't this a national disgrace?

Secondly, guaranteeing the status of teachers is even more regrettable! Today, a teacher's status has nothing to do with profound knowledge or rich experience. It completely depends on students' likes and dislikes, the principal's dismissal, and colleagues' factionalism. Even at a dignified National University today, the president can arbitrarily dismiss teachers and staff. What else can we say? And society's attitude towards teachers, who are "entrusted with heavy responsibilities and long journeys," is neither "respecting teachers" nor "valuing the Way." Past events like the "Su Yizhi incident" are enough to explain this. Teachers are subjected to double contempt. What is there to say about "guaranteeing status"?

There's no need to mention teachers' self-cultivation. Today, teachers' treatment is insufficient to support parents above and insufficient to care for children below. "If teeth are lost in old age, what good is death?" Those with connections are unwilling to "die old in the countryside" and are changing careers one after another. What's left is a group of desperate old teachers and a batch of new teachers with shallow qualifications filling the ranks. In rural elementary schools, graduates of higher primary schools are also teachers, and those who dropped out of junior high schools are teaching in middle schools. How can one expect them to perform? Zhuangzi said, "Focusing one's will and spirit leads to concentration." Ordinary teachers are so overwhelmed by the pressures of rice, oil, salt, and firewood that they feel dizzy. How can you ask them to "polish and sharpen" themselves, "strive for improvement," or anything else? It's just "worrying about its difficulty."

Not long ago, the news of a certain school principal raping a female student in the newspapers left us speechless. The overall decline in the quality of Chinese teachers is self-evident, but if the teachers' own character and personality also collapse, how can one bear to imagine the consequences?

Alright, it seems that the complaints have been exhausted. I must still praise teachers as being great after all. H.G. Wells of England said: "Teachers are the real creators of history, rulers. Politicians and the masses of our time are merely puppets of their childhood education." Long live teachers! Long live!

I'll end with two lines of a teacher's song: "Teachers respect me, establish my conduct in the world; teachers treat me as children, as daughters."

### Teacher's Salaries in Shanghai

— Paul

The salaries of teachers and staff in this city can be divided into two types: municipal and private.

The salaries of municipal school teachers and staff are the same as those of civil servants: base salary multiplied by 380, plus a living allowance of 80,000 yuan. If the average base salary is calculated at 100 yuan, each municipal school teacher receives 118,000 yuan in legal tender per month.

Private school teachers and staff, according to the Education Bureau's regulations, allocate 30% of the tuition fees collected to school expenses and 70% to teachers' salaries. Therefore, the treatment of private school teachers and staff varies and depends on the amount of tuition fees collected and the number of students. Their salaries may exceed those of municipal school teachers, but the majority are still lower than those of municipal school teachers.

The funding for municipal schools is approved by the Education Bureau, while private schools have always been financially independent. Therefore, in order to improve teachers' salaries and cope with the difficult life, they only have one way: to increase tuition fees.

### Also Discussing Puyi

— Qi Lu

Emperor's Luck, Puppet's Fate

When Puyi testified at the Tokyo International Tribunal and was cross-examined by the defense lawyers of the accused, his answers were repeatedly "I don't know" and "I'm not aware." Indeed, an emperor puppet who was not his own master, like Puyi, what could he know, what could he be aware of?

Puyi had never been a crown prince; his father, Zaifeng, was not an emperor. Because Zaitian (the Guangxu Emperor) died without a son, the imperial family chose his nephew Puyi to inherit the emperor's throne. At that time, Puyi was only two years old and was named the Xuantong Emperor. What is a three-year-old emperor if not a puppet?

After Puyi entered the emperor's luck at the age of three, he encountered the Xinhai Revolution in his third year. The puppet masters at that time were clever and opened negotiations with the revolutionary army, managing to enjoy the preferential treatment of the Republic. In the palace, Puyi was still considered an emperor, but the palace was also restricted. The ministers of the small court could no longer enter or exit Tiananmen from the south but could only enter or exit D'anmen from the north. This is like the small families in Shanghai—entering and exiting through the back door.

In the sixth year of the Republic, the pigtail master Zhang Xun caused a restoration and tried to lift Puyi out, but it didn't succeed. Zhang Xun fled into the Dutch embassy, and Puyi still sat securely in the palace, entering and exiting through the back door. Until the 13th year of the Republic, Feng Yuxiang returned his troops to Beijing, issued an eviction order to Puyi, and abolished the preferential treatment treaty for the Qing royal family. From then on, everyone thought that Puyi's emperor's luck had run out. Who knew that after the September 18th Incident in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], Puyi was taken by the Japanese Doihara Kenji from Tianjin to Dalian. The following year, he went to Changchun and became the head of the "Manchukuo," later changed to "Emperor." The Xuantong Emperor became the "Kangde Emperor," and Puyi again entered thirteen years of emperor's luck until he was captured by the Soviet Air Force at the Shenyang airfield in August of the 34th year of the Republic [1945] and became a prisoner. This time, his emperor's luck must be exhausted. Otherwise, the history of this world is reversing instead of progressing.

When Puyi was breastfeeding and became the Qing Dynasty emperor, he was truly a puppet. When he became the "Manchukuo" emperor after adulthood, he was still a puppet. During the decade before and after the 10th year of the Republic, when Puyi entered the youth period of his life, he was influenced by the New Culture Movement after the May Fourth Movement. He once invited Hu Shih into the palace to ask for advice and once wanted to freely choose his own marriage. The result of his marriage was still not his own choice. What he could choose was to cut off his braid at that time. This was the only conscious action in his life of being a puppet manipulated by others.

Puyi was originally the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty palace was the Ming Dynasty palace. The back door faced Coal Hill (also known as Jingshan), the place where Emperor Chongzhen, the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, committed suicide. I don't know what Puyi thought of the anger expressed by Emperor Chongzhen when he killed his children and then hanged himself, "I wish that in all lives, I would not be born into an imperial family"?

### Beggars Asking for Money

— Yang Wei

There are many beggars on the streets of Shanghai. Some are very young and still use tin cans with "nails"; if you don't give them money, they will stubbornly stay put and say impolite things. Their quick wit and high tolerance are really admirable! Have any readers encountered situations similar to the following?

"Old man, open your generous hands, live to be ninety-nine."

"No, no."

"Old sir, bright goes away, dark comes, not a penny lost on empty land."

"Turn around, turn around."

"Old sir, everyone has a heart of compassion, please save someone in trouble."

"Go, go, go!"

"Boss, the poor become rich, the rich are destined, today I give you a pancake, next year you'll open a big store with insurance."

"Run, run, run!"

"Children and grandchildren have their own blessings, don't be a beast of burden for them, old sir, please be generous."

"Get lost, get lost!"

"Damn it, will you give me something or not?"

"Cursing people means no donation."

"Pig brain, dog skin is useless, strangled to death, eyes closed, no descendants, you'll have to buy a coffin yourself."

### A Regretful Event in the Education World

— Zheng Fan

Random Thoughts on Current Affairs

Still the same old Chinese officialdom habits:

A few days ago, newspapers reported that Mr. ×××, the newly appointed president of × National ×× University – Note: This Mr. ××× is the educator who drove his car and fled the scene of an accident and was chased by the deputy chief of police – after taking office, decided to rehire only 38 out of the original 160 faculty and staff members. Professors and others expressed indignation at Mr. ×'s dismissal without cause and are currently negotiating.

The dismissal of teachers is a common sight in various private schools and academies in Shanghai and is not surprising. However, for it to happen at a dignified National University, which is praised as the "highest institution of learning," we cannot help but find it strange. The qualifications of × University's professors have long been praised domestically. During the Anti-Japanese War, the school moved to Jianyang in northern Fujian, and faculty and staff members left their families and devoted themselves to their work. It was because of their hard work that × University created a glorious history! And today, this group of "hardworking" faculty and staff members are being kept outside the school gates because the president has been changed!

It is said that Mr. × also has his "reasons." His reason is that he once said in a non-public conversation with the former president of × University, Mr. ×, that "some colleagues are preparing to help at Yingda [a British-run university], some colleagues already have high-paying jobs elsewhere, some colleagues have not been working hard, some colleagues cannot be placed... there are many reasons, too many to list in detail." Therefore, in order to respect the opinion of the former president Mr. ×××, Mr. × decided not to rehire these people.

In short, the dismissal of more than 100 faculty members was entirely due to the instructions of the former president Mr. ×××. Fortunately, Mr. × has died, and he is happy to push it on a dead person, indicating that it has nothing to do with himself.

However, faculty and staff members are neither slaves nor commodities. Why can they be arbitrarily manipulated and controlled in a "non-public conversation" (assuming Mr. × is telling the truth)? Are there sufficient evidence and reasons for each point raised?

The faculty and staff members of × University are crying out:

"Heaven knows, after returning to our homes, we are followed by layoffs. The beautiful dream of having a stable job has not been realized, and the threat of unemployment is imminent. The nation and the people are breathing the air of freedom, but we are being treated like slaves and goods, arbitrarily manipulated and controlled. We don't know what Mr. × is thinking, but he has used this unprecedented and perhaps never-to-be-repeated destructive method in the history of school appointments!"

Today is "Teacher's Day," but the teachers of × University are struggling in the dark.

This is indeed a great regret in the education world!

### At the Small Vegetable Market

— Jin Jing

I am a housewife in an eight-person household, so naturally I have to go to the vegetable market every day to buy vegetables. The square two-story vegetable market on Zhoushan Road is indeed quite well-scaled, with fish, meat, shrimp, crabs, all kinds of rare delicacies.

Because of poor purchasing power, every day carrying a basket, I always wander in a corner concentrated with vegetables, nothing more than buying some nutritious and relatively inexpensive vegetables to suit the material conditions of "coarse vegetables are enough to satisfy my hunger."

The world is deteriorating, and people's hearts are not as they used to be. Even buying and selling in the vegetable market is affected. In addition to disputes over haggling over weight, there has been an increase in the bad practice of grabbing and scooping. Sometimes there is even a fact that one buys less but scoops more.

I absolutely don't want to openly steal some scoops to increase the quantity and quality that I should get, but no matter what vegetables or bean sprouts I buy, they are much less than what the neighbor's wife buys for the same price.

This question was explained by someone familiar with the situation in the vegetable market, who knew that vegetable vendors because they resisted the bad habit of buyers grabbing and scooping, they have long calculated the extra demands of buyers into the cost, and the customers who do not grab and scoop from him are treated preferentially. This bad habit has become an open secret, and it is rare for those who don't understand it.

I can't bear to steal openly, and I can't help but go to the vegetable market to buy, but it seems that I am forever buying too few vegetables at an excessively high price, and I am endlessly burdened. I hope to destroy bad habits!

### Prominent Figure: Marshal Tito

— Gui Ting

The Dictator of Yugoslavia (Part 2)

Besides Tito's Communist Party, there were three other political groups in Yugoslavia: Mikhailovic's Chetnik party, Mussolini's supported terrorist group, Ustashe, and General Nedic's organized puppet government. Tito's Communist guerrillas were risking their lives to compete with them for power. Soon, Mikhailovic and Tito began fighting each other. Tito discredited his political enemies as collaborators with the Nazis. Until recently, Mikhailovic was actually executed for treason by collaborating with the enemy.

Everything Modeled After the Soviet Union

After Tito received support from the Soviet Union, his power rapidly increased. All his movements were completely modeled after the Soviet Union. The military used a clenched fist as a salute, but after the British mission arrived, it was abolished in December 1943. People's representatives were everywhere, supposedly carrying out the mission of spreading political education. The national flag used was the red star flag. Everyone called each other "comrade." Flyers always printed pictures of Tito and Stalin together. They also had a secret intelligence organization called OZNA, which was established by imitating the Soviet Union's NKVD and OGPU.

In 1943, in order to avoid conflict with their ally, the Soviet Union, the British and Americans abandoned Mikhailovic and began to support Tito. British and American supplies flowed to Tito's guerrillas, so they were also equipped in the English style. Young men and women all joined the guerrillas led by Tito. About 25% of his army were women. Physically strong village girls fought alongside men, sharing meals and living quarters, but there was no sexual promiscuity because Tito encouraged the creed that those who committed adultery should be shot.

About 70% of Tito's subordinates were young men under the age of 25. Most of the generals were around 30 years old. Tito also organized youth groups. Members participated in hysterical movements to support Tito. Their minds were filled day and night with exciting slogans such as "Freedom!" and "Liberation from Fascist oppression!" They muttered, "Ti-to—Ti-to—Ti-to!" like a pendulum. They didn't use their minds to analyze things. They all believed that they were fighting for "democracy" because their marshal told them to do so.

Tito's Party Platform

The National Liberation Front led by Tito called for the following party platform: (1) Establish a Yugoslav federation with national equality, (2) Safeguard democratic rights and freedoms, (3) Respect the inviolability of private property, and (4) Never launch revolutionary economic or social reforms. On the surface, it sounded quite good, but under Tito's rule, the entire economic and social organization of Yugoslavia gradually became Sovietized. Under Tito's orders, the people of Yugoslavia were brainwashed day and night with the thought of "the Great Soviet Union" and "the Glorious Soviet Union." Once, they even pointed to the 300 B-17 planes soaring in the sky and shouted, "This is the great Soviet Air Force!"

The recent deterioration in relations with the West shows that Yugoslavia may become the source of future global unrest. Look! On the west side of Yugoslavia is a long coastline full of ports, enough to accommodate the navies of the world, and on the east side is the Soviet Union, a continental country lacking an outlet, eyeing it covetously. In the middle sits Tito, a full-bodied former Soviet Communist Party commissioner.

The world seems to be standing on the edge of a volcanic eruption. Will Tito be the first to ignite the world by creating unrest?
