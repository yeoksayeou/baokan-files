Chen Recites Eight Years of Memoirs with a Calm Demeanor

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Urgent Telegram from Suzhou, 5th, 9:05 PM] From this morning, newspaper reporters have been constantly entering and leaving the High Court. By a little after 1 PM, the seats were full. At 2:35 PM, the bailiff shouted "Court is in session!" Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, President of the High Court, Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, Judge Chen Jiarui, etc., took their seats amidst the attention of thousands. The traitor Chen appeared calm and stated: Age 55, native of Nanfu, Guangdong, residing at No. 64 Beiping Road, Nanjing. In the third year of Guangxu, joined the Xingzhonghui and then joined the Kuomintang. Asked: How much property? Answer: The house is rented; please investigate the property. Chief Prosecutor Han Tao then stood up and announced the intent of the prosecution, roughly stating: The defendant held important positions in the Party and government, but actually sided with the traitor Wang, leaving Rong and flying to Hanoi. Chen also went to Hong Kong, where he published the scandalous telegram, and then joined the puppet organization, holding important positions. He even went to Japan as a special envoy to express gratitude, showing no shame. The major deeds of endangering the country are ten in number: (1) Concluding secret treaties that humiliated the country, (2) Aiding the enemy, (3) Issuing counterfeit currency, (4) Participating in the anti-British and American war, (5) Drafting young men, (6) Publicly selling opium, (7) Implementing traitorous education, (8) Using the pretext of "cleansing the countryside" to harm patriots, (9) Embezzlement, (10) Recruiting puppet troops, endangering the nation and harming the people, truly committing the crimes stipulated in Articles 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 13 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The presiding judge then ordered Chen to answer briefly. Chen then read from his confession, "Memoirs of the Past Eight Years," stating:

(1) Several years of hard work must be spoken of. During the January 28th Incident, he advocated resistance and demanded that Zhang Xueliang resign along with him because Zhang Xueliang refused to resist. When the Battle of Gubeikou broke out, Zhu specially returned to the country to face the national crisis together. However, according to reports from the soldiers, the firepower was too poor, resulting in huge losses. Wang actually knew nothing about the Tanggu Agreement, and did not defend himself even when attacked. (2) In the 23rd year, the country had gradually split into two factions, and villains were further provoking them. Wang's family all advised Wang to resign from the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Chen also advised him. Wang was in great pain and only said: "Which wise man would be willing to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs?" However, because the strength of the war was too different, wanting to preserve the nation's vitality and fearing that the Communist Party would reap the benefits, he advocated peace. (3) Chen himself opposed the peace movement in , believing that whether peace or war, the entire country should be united, and also mistakenly believed that the Japanese were sincere in negotiating peace. However, Wang did not want the common people to die with them. If Chen himself stayed in the mainland, he would be even more suspected, and he wanted to dissuade from going to Japan, but refused to allow it. Later, Wang's return to the capital was all prepared, and Chen knew that the matter was hopeless. (3) He opposed the puppet Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and did not participate in the discussion, as he had told Abe Shigemitsu and others that he opposed it. He also opposed the special administration of North China, promoted the Three Principles of the People, and promoted clean politics. The Japanese, because they felt that Nanjing still had hostility, called those who were waiting for peace and resistance. (4) After Wang's death, if the Ning organization was immediately disbanded, he feared that no one would be responsible and there would be great chaos. However, he had sent a telegram expressing his feelings and emphasized that the Party should not be divided and the country must be unified. (5) After the Japanese surrender, he tried to avoid the Japanese army from trampling on the local area or colluding with the Communist army, and tried to maintain security. However, because the situation of the military school's Kondo Division and the navy was unstable, Ren Yuandao repeatedly urged him to avoid it. Later, he flew to Japan, leaving a long letter to Chairman , stating that as soon as he received the order, he would immediately come to Nanjing to await punishment. (6) The Beijing organization ultimately preserved the nation's vitality, and Japanese newspapers also said that the people in the occupied areas hated Japan and felt that the world was still in the tribal era, and should pay attention to military preparations, eliminate illiteracy, and engage in technology, and should never only seek pleasure. At this point, there was a half-hour break.

Answers to the Indictment: (1) He always opposed the Basic Relations Treaty and made this clear to Honda Shigemitsu. When the alliance treaty was later signed, the provisions for stationing troops in North China were cancelled, and he told the envoy Koiso that true peace could only be achieved if the statement recognizing Manchukuo was revoked. (2) Nanjing had tried its best to obtain materials and maintain national strength, hence the saying that peaceful resistance was better than resistance. (3) The Legislative Yuan was not responsible for the decisions of the Central Political Committee; the issuance of Central Reserve Certificates was to resist Japanese military scrip. (4) Nanjing's participation in the war was to take the opportunity to absorb resources, and he advocated that our country mediate the Japanese war against foreign countries. (5) He denied drafting young men, referring to it as recruitment. (6) The opium trade was because the Japanese wanted to obtain secret funds. Although he was the Director-General of Opium Suppression, Yuan Yuquan was actually responsible. (7) The compilation of puppet textbooks was during the Reorganized National Government period. After Wang came, the national flag was changed and the Three Principles of the People were publicly promoted. (8) Cleansing the countryside was intended to reduce the suffering of the countryside. He did not deny his responsibility, but he did not want to take the blame for others. (9) He deeply hated the atmosphere of corruption, which could not be changed in a short time. (10) He never persuaded people from Chongqing to join the puppet government, and transferred Sun Liangcheng to northern Jiangsu to serve as a barrier to the southeast, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Communists.

Defending Wang: Wang had sought peace, and he did not agree with Wang's advice, but he sympathized with Wang's hardships. He had completed the road to unification, so that the Northeast would not be ravaged. The traitor Chen then requested that his confession be published.

Asked: If you did not agree with the peace movement, why did you leave Sichuan? And why did you transfer from Hong Kong to Shanghai? Answer: It was based on the righteousness of revolutionary comrades and to remedy Wang's mistakes. Asked: Did you know that forming a government was against the law? Answer: In legal terms, it was against the law, but in political terms, he really wanted to send this agreement to Chongqing and have Chiang agree to it later. Asked: Did you know that it would affect the future of the war of resistance? Answer: He opposed Wang's actions and sympathized with Wang's feelings. Asked: What did you do in Japan? Answer: The first time was to return the courtesy and question the unreasonableness of the Basic Treaty. The second time was to seek to sign an alliance treaty. Asked: Since you opposed recognizing Manchukuo, did you ensure that this article was cancelled? Answer: It is being discussed and revised. (Continued on page 2)

Small Scenes in the Court

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Urgent Telegram from Suzhou, 5th, 10:08 PM] Today, when the traitor Chen was escorted from prison, it was originally planned to use a chartered car, but the driver refused to work for the great traitor, so a horse-drawn carriage was used instead.

Wherever the traitor Chen passed, the streets were crowded with people, all wanting to see the face of the great traitor. Many people occupied the windows of buildings along the street to watch from above. The court session opened at 2:30 PM, and people had already gone to the High Court at 10 AM to occupy the seats in the audience. When the reporter arrived at 12 PM, most of the seats were already taken. By 1 PM, it was already full, and those who came later had to stand.

Before the trial, Secretary-General Yang, both old and young, was running back and forth, quite busy. At 2 PM, Secretary-General Yang announced: (1) Examination of the emperor's hearing certificate is required, (2) Smoking is not allowed, (3) Do not run around, (4) No strange noises, (5) Please sit upright to maintain order in the court.

By the time the trial was scheduled to begin, the group of reporters had arrived and were waiting quietly. There were four female reporters, sitting in a corner, and next to them were several major generals, who seemed to be quite familiar, talking and laughing, quite like heroes and beauties. There were many women in the audience, but most of them left halfway after the court session began at 4 PM.

Today, there was only one foreign female guest who came to listen to the trial, but it was already late, and there were no seats, which was quite embarrassing.

At 2:25 PM, the traitor Chen was escorted by four armed bailiffs and walked into the gate of the court. Because the time had not yet arrived, he first walked into the fifth waiting room. At exactly 2:30 PM, it was announced that the court session was open, and everyone stood up. The judge, the judge, the prosecutor, and the clerk walked out of the side door in a file and sat in the main hall. Then, the traitor Chen was also escorted from the fifth waiting room to the court.

Chen was wearing a serge robe and a monk's hat. When he approached the judge, he took off his hat, held the file in his hand, walked slowly into the court, stood in the defendant's column, and looked quite natural.

First, the judge asked about his age and origin. When asked if he had any property, the traitor Chen made a strong smile and replied: This is hard to say, please investigate.

Then, the chief prosecutor narrated the ten major crimes of the traitor Chen, which lasted 37 minutes. When he mentioned the puppet government's cleansing of the countryside, which harmed northern Jiangsu, he particularly emphasized his tone, as he was a native of northern Jiangsu.

During the trial, every time Chen made a move, the sound of the camera followed. The photographers also used the light of the strong lights to capture the scene.

The photographers squatted, or bent over, or leaned on the ground, showing various wonderful scenes.

When the traitor Chen read his confession, when he read to Chairman Chiang, he called him Mr. Chiang, and the judge corrected him and changed it to Chairman Chiang.

The traitor Chen's confession was one inch thick, with more than 60,000 small characters, and more than 30 pages.

The traitor Chen spoke Mandarin, interspersed with Cantonese.

The traitor Chen's eyesight was not good, and he often put on his glasses temporarily to look at the evidence presented by the court, and then took off his glasses again after finishing, moving them up and down, quite busy.

The traitor Chen used to call himself chairman, but today he is facing the court, I wonder what he is thinking.

A gramophone was placed in the court and a record was played as corroborating evidence, creating a precedent for trial records.

When the traitor Chen finished reading his confession, he finally said that in the current situation, he could be tried in any way, and he could be sentenced in any way.

The traitor Chen requested twice that the court publish his defense, and the judge replied that this was a matter for the court and was under consideration.

### Marshall Will Return to China Next Week to Find a Solution to the Northeast Problem

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Authoritative sources said today that General Marshall was deeply disturbed by the news of the escalating conflict between the Nationalists and Communists in the Northeast, and was eager to repeat his mission to mediate peace in China. He is expected to leave the United States for Chongqing within the next week. It was also said that Marshall and the State Department believed that he should return quickly to prevent the deterioration of relations between the Nationalists and Communists, but Marshall was still very optimistic about the ultimate success of his mission. He believed that most of the recent mutual accusations between the Nationalists and Communists over the Northeast issue were aimed at gaining bargaining power, rather than an indication of an expanding rift. The source also said that Marshall believed that it was necessary to return to China as soon as possible after hearing that China would improve relations on its own without the active intervention of American officials. Marshall and other American officials in China believe that it is impossible to act only as advisors and mediators, and that they must actively lead in order to make any progress. Officials here are deeply concerned about the Northeast problem, mostly because they still lack accurate information about the political, economic and military situation in the Northeast. They said that Marshall will be able to find a solution to the various problems in the Northeast after returning to China. Marshall has made "some progress" in his mission, which allowed him to return to the United States for a trip during the Nationalist-Communist negotiations. Marshall believes that the greatest threat to his efforts is famine, which has already occurred in central China. He is working hard here to obtain surplus ships to transport food to the Yangtze River, and at the same time, inland river sailors are being recruited in the Philippines, Japan and other places. Authoritative sources have learned that Marshall believes that General Zhou Enlai is a shrewd and experienced bargainer, but he is actually a very sound person, and Marshall hopes to achieve a final solution through this. He believes that after returning to China and holding talks with Chairman Chiang and Zhou Enlai, and stepping up efforts to implement the agreement at the lower level, most of the problems can be solved easily.

### Control Council for Japan Convenes; MacArthur Delivers Important Speech: Threat of Power Inevitably Causes Suspicion and Hatred; Determination to Continue Occupation Policy

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] In his opening address to the first meeting of the Control Council for Japan, comprised of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, MacArthur today advocated that all countries in the world should take Japan's new constitution as a model and unanimously abolish the use of war as an instrument of national sovereignty. MacArthur was seated with representatives from the United States and Britain to his left, and with representatives from China and the Soviet Union to his right. MacArthur also denounced the threat of power, border incursions, secret maneuvers, and disregard for public morality, which inevitably lead to suspicion and hatred. MacArthur openly stated that the mission of the council was only advisory in nature and that he intended to continue to pursue his occupation policy to avoid oppression or arbitrary actions, and to instill in the minds of the Japanese the principles of freedom and rights that they had never known. A large portion of MacArthur's opening speech was about the abolition of war, and a smaller portion addressed the occupation policy and answered outside criticisms. MacArthur also stated that since the Council was advisory in nature, it did not share the significant administrative responsibilities of the United Nations, which was the sole executive authority in Japan. However, he hoped that the Council would be a valuable element in the solution of many future problems, and that the management of Japan would continue to be carried out by the existing government structure. The soundness of this policy could be clearly demonstrated by the progress of the occupation. MacArthur, wearing a winter military uniform and a five-star insignia, attended the meeting at 10:00 AM and delivered his speech for a total of twenty-five minutes in a clear and firm tone. He concluded by urging all representatives to solidify the peace that had been achieved through great sacrifice. MacArthur left the meeting shortly after delivering his speech.

MacArthur's headquarters announced today that Major General Marquat, the chief of the Economic and Scientific Section, would be MacArthur's representative to the Four-Power Control Council for Japan. Colonel Fellers, the military advisor, would be the secretary-general of the Council.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] British representative Ball and Soviet representative Derevyanko declined to immediately comment on MacArthur's opening remarks. Chinese representative Lieutenant General Chu Shih-ming said that he was deeply moved, but declined to comment on any specific issue. The Council will meet at least once every two weeks, with the meeting date set for Wednesday. These meetings will be informal meetings.

Various Meetings Will Be Open

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] After MacArthur's opening address, the Four-Power Control Council for Japan discussed organizational matters. Soviet representative Derevyanko proposed that all meetings of the Council should be held in secret, with no reporters allowed to attend. Only communiqués would be issued by the Council from time to time. US representative Marquat proposed that all major meetings should be open, while informal meetings could be subject to reasonable restrictions. After ten minutes of discussion, all representatives agreed to Marquat's proposal. British representative Ball and Chinese representative Chu Shih-ming both supported Marquat. The representatives then discussed the responsibilities of the secretary.

During today's discussion of the meeting procedures, the Soviet representative proposed that if a majority of the members of the Japanese parliament elected in the April 10th election were deemed unsuitable, new elections should be held. He also proposed that MacArthur should send a copy of any directive issued to the Japanese government to the Council representatives at least seven days in advance. If a proclamation was issued, the Japanese government should send a copy to the Council at least ten days before the proclamation was made. The Soviet representative also requested that the Council secretariat should be internationalized. This issue will be raised for discussion at the second meeting on April 10th.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] The representatives of China, the Soviet Union, and Britain on the Four-Power Control Council for Japan stated today that they would present important proposals at the Council meeting on April 17th, but declined to disclose their nature.

Zhenjiang

Personnel Dispatched to Unseal Moldy Materials

The 57th Division of the garrison here, which was ordered to guard more than one hundred enemy and puppet warehouses, had long sealed them. All materials had reached a state where "wheat sprouts and noodles turned into cakes" and were unbearable. Numerous telegrams were sent to the military headquarters requesting personnel to be dispatched to handle the matter quickly. Director Dong had also traveled to Nanjing several times to request instructions on how to handle the situation. According to Director Dong, the Headquarters of the Army has approved the handling of enemy and puppet warehouses.

Songjiang

Dragon Lantern Festival Leads to Fatal Shooting

In the near countryside of Ye Xie, farmers used the spring gap to make and race dragon lanterns. On the third day, at dusk, the dragon lanterns from each village gathered in Ye Xie to compete. The spectators were crowded and the road was blocked. When the lanterns arrived at the Guandi Temple in the town, farmers from each village jumped onto the stage to watch. The temple originally had a police substation. A policeman carrying a gun went on stage to stop them, but failed and used the butt of his gun to injure a villager. This aroused public anger, and they rushed forward. The policeman retreated to a long-standing place. The crowd chased after him relentlessly. The chief of police was unable to disperse the crowd and fired a shot (one version says he fired into the air) as a warning. One person in the crowd was hit in a vital spot and died immediately. Four others were seriously injured. The spectators scattered and fled, and the dragon lanterns returned to their villages. Director Zhang of the police substation went to the county bureau at noon on the fourth to report the incident and was ordered to remain at the bureau pending investigation.

### The Trial of Traitor Chen Gongbo (Continued from First Page)

Question: Were the members of the puppet Central Political Conference all members of the Kuomintang? Answer: Most of them were, and some were members of the Youth Party, the State Socialist Party, and non-partisans. Question: Among the resolutions of the third meeting, were there resolutions that "Chongqing decrees are all invalid," "all internal and external measures are invalid," "the military is to cease duties and await orders," and "all civil servants are to report to Nanjing"? Answer: Although the resolution was like this, all subsequent government orders were not handled in accordance with it. Question: Did you not recognize the central government? Answer: The situation was very complicated (American accent). Question: Did the Outline for the Establishment of the Puppet Government stipulate a comprehensive peace treaty between China and Japan, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and economic cooperation with Japan? Answer: Yes, but comprehensive peace was when Wang and others explored peace and hoped that Chongqing would agree. Question: Did you participate in the recognition of Manchukuo? Answer: I fundamentally opposed it, and therefore opposed the Basic Treaty. Question: On February 26, 1935, the third anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo, did you broadcast a speech in your capacity as the president of the Executive Yuan, advocating cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo? Answer: I don't remember clearly. Question; Is there a recording of your own voice? Answer: I don't remember clearly. At that time, the court played the recording twice. Question: Is that you speaking? Answer: I am not clear myself. The court played it again. Chen said the voice was similar, but he could not be sure, and this was nothing more than a formality. Question: During the period when you served as the acting puppet chairman, were the orders signed by you? Answer: Yes. Question: When Chu was the governor of Guangdong Province, there was an exchange of telegrams about the distribution of opium, saying that the quantity of soil was very small and that the puppet Manchukuo could not deliver it on schedule. Answer: Yuan Yuqian was responsible, and I only signed my name because I was nominally the Superintendent of Opium Suppression. At this point, Chen said that the case was extremely complicated but also extremely simple, and asked the court to render a verdict as it pleased, and he would not say a word of injustice nor would he appeal. The court announced that the investigation of evidence was complete. The prosecutor argued: (1) The cancellation of extraterritoriality in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the recovery of concessions, etc., and the recognition of the puppet state of Manchuria, were visible in the defendant's own broadcast after Britain and the United States canceled them first. (2) The puppet government should think of the people, so why did it send out so many control societies? (3) The puppet currency's resistance to the Japanese military scrip was credible and all Japanese proposals, destroying our country's finances. (4) Without the assistance of Britain and the United States, our country would have perished, and he knew that the central government would win, so he only did a little work to seek exoneration. (5) The conscription of able-bodied men was indeed a fact. (6) The public sale of opium was extremely evident in the telegram Chen sent to Chu on July 30, 1935. (7) The "Qingxiang" harmed the people the most; the Qingxiang also cleared out the bottom of the boxes. (8) This court investigated one thousand several hundred traitors, and evidence of bribery and public funds can be found everywhere. (9) The harassment of the puppet army was also all commissioned by the defendant. According to the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals, Chen should be responsible. (10) Wang's leadership desire was too great, so his behavior was even worse than Qin Hui's, and Chen had repeatedly advised but did not listen, so why didn't he leave, and instead became the president, and acted for him three times." Chen replied that the prosecutor spoke from the perspective of the essence of the Spring and Autumn Annals, and he dared not consider himself of such quality. However, he was responsible for all the affairs that Wang obtained, and he would not utter a word of injustice after the verdict. He then responded to the ten points, slightly defending himself, especially regarding the Qingxiang point, saying that this matter ended in August 1933 because he opposed it and it was canceled. He said that he had harmed underground work comrades and could only say the words "great lord, injustice." All the underground workers he knew and could help, he bailed out. Lower-level personnel acted recklessly in violation of orders, and he could not be responsible. If the court insisted on holding him accountable in accordance with the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals, then he was also willing to accept it, but if a clerk in the Jiangsu Provincial Government committed a crime, should the chairman of the province also be responsible? At that time, the public defender Gao Rongqi stood up to defend him, especially pointing out that Chen had established two radio stations, one for underground workers and one for Dai Li's use, which meant that he had made contributions to the War of Resistance and asked for leniency. The presiding judge then announced the end of the debate and set the verdict for 4:00 PM on the 12th. It was 8:30 PM when the court adjourned.

Editorial

### Peaceful Discussion on the Capital Issue

The issue of the national capital is evident in the resolutions passed by this session of the Participatory Political Council. During the general session of this Council, Councilors Ping Deheng and others proposed a motion requesting the government to explicitly designate Beiping as the national capital. The motion was passed by the general session and submitted to the government for consideration and implementation. The passage of this motion, recorded in official documents, indicates that the issue of the national capital is of concern to the people of the nation. Prior to this, in the past two or three years, people in Chongqing and other places have also had heated discussions on the so-called capital issue, with some advocating for the capital to be in Beiping, others for moving west to Xi'an, and still others suggesting building the capital in Jinan or Changchun. All of the above were originally personal opinions and did not necessarily require much attention. However, the motion recently passed by the Participatory Political Council is no longer the personal opinion of one or two individuals, but represents the opinion of the entire Council; and the so-called Participatory Political Council is said to be representative of public opinion. Now that the Council has passed a motion requesting the government to explicitly designate Beiping as the national capital, the government certainly has its own considerations as to whether to adopt it. However, because this motion has been proposed and passed, we cannot deny the existence of this issue, and therefore we must also discuss this so-called capital issue.

Originally, the national capital should be a non-issue. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Republic of China was established in Nanjing. Later, when Yuan Shikai came to power and moved the capital to the north, the progress of the National Revolution was hindered and could not be fully implemented. The Chinese Nationalist Party completed the National Revolution, established its government in Guangzhou, launched the Northern Expedition, and after capturing Nanjing, designated it as the capital. From the historical viewpoint of the Chinese national liberation movement, Nanjing should be the national capital of our country, and there is no question about it. Those who now question the establishment of the capital in Nanjing do so perhaps because they believe that its location is close to Shanghai, and Shanghai is a den of vice. The close proximity of the capital to Shanghai makes it easy for Shanghai's bad habits to spread to Nanjing, forming the so-called collusion between officials and merchants, leading to a gradual decline in political integrity. Or, they may be based on national defense considerations, believing that its location is along the river and near the sea. Based on the experience in this war of resistance, they believe that the location is not safe and should be moved elsewhere. Or, they may start from a historical perspective, believing that establishing the capital in Nanjing is only a temporary arrangement, insufficient to build a grand nation for permanent prosperity. Or, they may be based on geographical considerations, believing that its location is biased towards the southeast and not the heart of the country. In addition, there are those who, from a psychological point of view, believe that its location, being biased towards the east and south, may lead to negligence in governing the border regions. All of the above opinions, although seemingly insightful, are difficult to sustain upon closer examination.

The decline in political integrity is not a matter of location but of people. If we do not consider the issue from the perspective of people and instead focus on the choice of location, believing that moving the capital will be a good solution, there will be no good results, and there is no need to say more. Therefore, the key to changing the increasingly corrupt political climate is not in moving the capital but in choosing the right people. As for the national defense point of view, in today's warfare, it is the age of atomic bombs, long-range air raids, and long-range rocket artillery, and no place has an absolute sense of security. The key to strengthening national defense is not in moving the capital, but in the determination and hard work of our entire nation. Furthermore, although this war of resistance came from the ocean in the east, who can guarantee that the next war will not come from the northwest sky? Nanjing is at the crossroads of the north and south oceans, and from a national defense point of view, it is still an important town. If we take a rigid historical view, believing that establishing the capital in Nanjing is only a temporary arrangement, insufficient to build a grand nation for permanent prosperity, this is really a historical superstition that is seemingly correct but actually wrong, and it is insufficient to discuss in today's era of scientific advancement into the realm of atomic energy. The geographical center and the national capital are two different things; the national capital is often not located in the geographical center of a country. The Soviet Union's territory stretches from the far east of the North Pacific, facing America's Alaska across the sea, to the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea in Europe, while its capital, Moscow, is located in the western part of the European continent. The capital of the United States, Washington, D.C., is located on the Atlantic coast and not in its geographical heartland. London in England, is it not also located in the southeast of the British Isles? Based on the above examples, it can be seen that the location of the national capital has nothing to do with the geographical center. As for the consolidation of border administration, that is entirely a matter of people, a matter of determination, and not a matter of location. The capital of the United States is in Washington, D.C., on the Atlantic coast, while its operations extend to the Philippines and the Ryukyu Islands across the Pacific Ocean. The capital of the Soviet Union is in Moscow on the European continent, while its border operations extend to the eastern end of Siberia, facing North America's Alaska across the Bering Strait. This proves that the operation of the border is one thing, and the location of the national capital is another, and the two are not directly related.

We have not been able to read the full text of the motion passed by this session of the Participatory Political Council requesting the government to explicitly designate Beiping as the national capital, and we cannot deduce the reasons for it. We can generally guess that it is nothing more than that Beiping is close to Liaoning and Shenyang, so that governing the Northeast and even the border regions will not be a case of being too far away to be effective and unable to hear and see everything. Moreover, its location was originally the capital, and there are many official residences and houses that can be used. In addition, there may be some historical and geographical superstitionists who believe that building the capital in Beiping can control the entire country, which is not as biased towards the southeast as Nanjing. We believe that these are not strong reasons for establishing the capital in Beiping. The establishment of the capital in Nanjing is deeply historically linked to the National Revolution in China, and it is also the location of the mausoleum of the founding father of the nation. The setbacks of the past National Revolution were partly due to the move of the capital to the north and the expansion of Yuan Shikai and other warlord feudal forces. Now, as the country celebrates the victory of the War of Resistance, it should actively launch the great cause of nation-building in Nanjing, the location of the capital when the full-scale war of resistance was launched, and establish a grand model for the country for all time. Although the Participatory Political Council has passed this motion, we feel that it is best not to make too many changes. Nanjing's status as the national capital of our country is similar to that of Washington, D.C., as the national capital of the United States. We must cherish the position that Nanjing occupies in the Chinese national liberation movement!

Furthermore, the change of the national capital represents political turmoil and instability. Today, the capital can be moved to Beiping, but who knows if tomorrow it can be moved from Beiping to Lanzhou, to Wuhan, or even to Guangzhou in Lingnan? All of these are signs of an unhealthy national life. Now that the country is after a long period of war, it must achieve stability in the midst of turmoil. With the progress of the National Revolution, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, it has also actively devoted itself to the construction of the capital, and at that time, there was no dissent regarding the construction of the capital. The victory of the War of Resistance and the return of the capital to Nanjing is a natural thing; however, the Participatory Political Council has now passed this motion to evade the capital at this time, which is also a sign of the people losing confidence. The location of the national capital is one thing for personal preferences, and another thing for the great plans of the nation and the people. We still feel that establishing the capital in Nanjing is a non-issue. We want to build Nanjing, just like the Americans built Washington, D.C., and the Turks built Ankara.

### Many British Civil Servants

The Whole Country Will Be Civil Servants in Fifty Years

[Reuter, London, 5th] Lord Balfour told the House of Lords yesterday that with Britain's population gradually decreasing and state-run programs gradually advancing, it is expected that by the year 2000, every citizen will be a civil servant. In 1914, there were 250,000 British civil servants, which increased to 320,000 in 1930, and to 716,000 last year. Currently, there are 691,000. It is expected that after all state-run programs are fully implemented, one in four people in the country will be directly employed by the state.

### Italian Miss Deceived and Commits Murder, Shooting and Killing a British Officer, Cries Loudly and Reads Love Letters in Court

[United Press, Rome, 4th] Miss Scelery, a promoter of Italian women's rights, met British Army Captain Rysch. Later, after discovering that she had been deceived by Rysch, she shot and killed him in his office in Rome last October 10. The Rome court opened the trial today, and the audience was extremely crowded, with Miss Scelery being regarded as a heroine. Before the opening, the audience seats were already packed, and up to 2,000 people were unable to enter. A love letter from Miss Scelery to Rysch was read aloud in court. At that time, Miss Scelery looked dejected and stood up slightly from the defendant's seat, crying out loudly, "Enough! Enough!" The letter was dated September 29, and it said, "Tonight I will wait for you to come, this will be the most beautiful night in our lives." According to Miss Scelery, Rysch was not only married, but also had a new love. I killed Rysch not only to clear my name and punish Rysch, but also to protect Italian women. The audience was visibly moved. The court then announced that the trial would continue on Friday morning, and several women even stepped forward to kiss Miss Scelery.

### Important Speech by Minister Gu - Mission to Shanghai is to Find Ways to Eliminate Labor Disputes - Labor-Management Arbitration Committee Will Be Established Soon

Minister Gu Zhengwang of the Ministry of Social Affairs recently came to Shanghai from Chongqing to discuss with all parties ways to eliminate labor disputes, and also convened a meeting with worker representatives. A reporter made a special trip to interview him, and his answers are as follows:

Q: What is Minister Gu's mission to Shanghai? A: Recently, the labor problem in Shanghai has been quite serious. I was instructed by President Song to come to Shanghai to observe the actual situation and, based on the "Emergency Measures to Accelerate Economic Recovery" passed by the Second Plenary Session, to discuss effective ways to eliminate labor disputes with relevant agencies. Q: What is the policy for eliminating labor disputes? A: Based on the spirit of labor-management coordination, on the one hand, we will try to resolve and protect the legitimate demands and legal interests of workers. On the other hand, we will rectify labor discipline and crack down on illegal activities in order to stabilize workers' lives and production order, and achieve the goal of accelerating economic recovery. Now, most factories only pay attention to increasing production and ignore the close relationship between production and labor welfare. Most workers only pay attention to increasing wages and do not know that wage increases should be based on the development of industry. Therefore, the elimination of labor-management disputes, fundamentally speaking, still requires both labor and management to have a full understanding of the significance of the mutual coordination of economic and social policies. Q: The "Emergency Measures to Accelerate Economic Recovery" passed by the Second Plenary Session stipulates the establishment of a labor-management arbitration committee to curb acts of slow-down and strikes. When will this arbitration committee be established in this city? A: The organization of the labor-management arbitration committee has now been agreed upon and will be established soon. The main powers of the committee are: (1) Matters related to the adjustment of general worker treatment. (2) Emergency handling of major labor-management disputes. (3) Handling of labor disputes in transportation, public utilities, and state-owned enterprises. After the establishment of the committee, it will supervise factories, mines, transportation and public utility enterprises at any time to adjust worker treatment in order to stabilize worker life and prevent disputes. When labor-management disputes occur, they should be arbitrated by the committee, and its rulings have the force of mandatory execution. Furthermore, during the recovery period, employers or workers may not suspend operations or strike or slow down work due to any labor-management disputes without going through legal procedures. If there are violations, the government may take effective measures to stop them. If this is done, it is hoped that labor disputes in this city can be gradually eliminated. Q: The Social Bureau of this city recently decided to adjust wages monthly based on the worker's cost of living index. What is Minister Gu's opinion on this? A: Determining wages based on the worker's cost of living index is quite reasonable. During the War of Resistance, the provinces in the rear did so. Recently, due to more drastic price fluctuations, the industrial and commercial enterprises in this city are adjusting wages monthly. If this can continue to be done in the future, labor-management disputes can be reduced. However, if production and business conditions are not good and the employer is indeed unable to bear the cost, it can be issued at a reduced rate based on the cost of living index after labor-management consultation or government arbitration. Q: Recently, workers have arbitrarily slowed down or gone on strike, and there have been incidents of surrounding office premises, obstructing the freedom of factory personnel, and blockading factory gates and destroying machinery. The public is quite anxious about this. How will the government handle this? A: These behaviors are all inappropriate. Recently, labor discipline has been deteriorating. The government is determined to rectify it in order to maintain the stable development of production undertakings and protect the real interests of workers. If this continues, it will not only affect production order and social order, but will also make production more depressed, increase the possibility of worker unemployment, and make it more difficult to improve worker living conditions. It is hoped that workers in all industries will truly understand this meaning and abide by labor discipline in the future. It has recently been reported that non-industry workers are instigating labor disputes and coercing strikes, which is particularly illegal and should be strictly prohibited by the government and military and police agencies. Q: Will the Ministry of Social Affairs continue to provide relief to unemployed workers in the future? A: It should continue to be done. However, now that factories are gradually resuming work, the number of unemployed workers is also decreasing. Moreover, the liaison office of the Ministry in Beijing and Shanghai has been closed in accordance with regulations. In the future, the relief work for unemployed workers will be transferred to the Social Bureau of this city to take charge of. Q: How will the workers sent to Shanghai from the rear be resettled? A: There are not many people who have come to Shanghai now. Most of these workers followed the factories to the rear during the War of Resistance and have worked hard in the rear for several years, making many contributions. The government has now decided to give these workers the opportunity to resume work with priority. Before they resume work, they will also be given the necessary relief.

[Additional News] Minister Gu is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing tomorrow and fly back to Chongqing from Beijing the day after tomorrow. He will fly back to Beijing from Chongqing in about two weeks.

### Director of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Bureau, Dr. Joseph Needham, Arrives in Shanghai

[Reported by This Newspaper] Dr. Joseph Needham, director of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Bureau, came to China from the United States in 1943 and has worked in the rear for three years, engaging in liaison work between China and the United Kingdom in science and technology. Today, he will leave Shanghai via Hong Kong to return to Cambridge University in the United Kingdom to work for a period of time for the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The British Information Office held a press conference for Mr. Lee at the British Consulate yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., with more than 20 reporters from various newspapers attending. First, Mr. Lai Jiasuoliya, director of the British Information Office, gave a brief introduction, and Mr. Lee then gave a speech, elaborating on the purpose and past work of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Bureau in detail.

### The Chamber of Commerce Suggests Five Points - Resolving the Industrial Crisis - Please Consider and Adopt Them Fairly

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the municipal government, the Municipal Social Bureau, and the Municipal Provisional Council regarding the crisis caused by labor disputes in various industries, putting forward five suggestions. The original text is roughly as follows: The Chamber has repeatedly received statements from various industrial trade associations, stating that the current labor disputes are turbulent and dangerous, and requesting that relevant industrial trade associations be convened to discuss effective measures. A meeting was scheduled for April to convene various industrial trade associations to elect representatives to attend a conversation meeting. On that day, those who were invited to attend included 17 associations, including the paper-making industry, woolen textile industry, finishing and dyeing industry, dyeing and weaving industry, foundry industry, and knitting industry. They separately stated the situation of surging labor disputes affecting production, including cases where workers were dissatisfied with the adjustments of workers' jobs and went on strike, cases where labor-management agreements were reached, but the union did not agree and went on strike, and cases where labor-management agreements were reached, but the labor side insisted on different opinions based on their own standards for wages and went on strike. After improving worker benefits,

Work Efficiency Greatly Reduced

According to common sense, at least their usual work efficiency should be maintained, but the result is the opposite. Most workers are lazy in their work, and production decreases daily. Taking the report of the woolen textile finishing and dyeing industry as an example, it is said that according to the industry's production records, most of them are less than one-half of the original amount. In terms of production costs, factory overhead used to account for only 20% of the total cost, and raw materials accounted for about 80%. Currently, raw materials account for only 30%, and the remaining 70% is all factory overhead, and among the factory overhead, the expenses for workers account for the majority. The demands they put forward for improving treatment even take the state-owned China Textile Corporation as a proportion, completely ignoring that each industry has its own situation, and the strength of private factories is difficult to compete with state-owned factories. Workers' treatment has increased by 6,000 times compared to before the war. Although the factories have tried their best to adjust, the agreement reached in the morning is overturned in the evening. The number of woolen textile finishing and dyeing industry firms is not large. In just over ten days, there have been four strikes, making it difficult to cope. Currently, the price of woolen cloth for foreign orders, including tariffs and water feet, is about one to three compared with the price of domestic products. In the future, after foreign goods flood in, the crisis of domestic woolen cloth is imminent. The situation of other industries is roughly the same. The workers do not understand the principle of sharing weal and woe, and make excessive demands at any time, which is regrettable. According to the statements of the industries that attended the meeting, the current operation of the factories is not profitable, but to maintain the overall situation and avoid creating a panic of mass unemployment and increasing social unrest. In the future, after foreign goods flood in, if wages continue to rise with the cost of living index, the factories will be forced to shut down, which is inevitable.

Losses from Slow-Downs are Greater Than Strikes

The current actual difficulties are extremely complex, and there are those that cannot be summarized in the four principles set by the mayor. According to the discussion results of the representatives of various industries who attended the meeting, they were summarized into five items, and the following suggestions are put forward: (A) Post-war construction is extremely difficult. If the people still want to enjoy the pre-war life, it is no longer reasonable. Therefore, multiplying the actual salary number before the war by the daily cost of living index should be the most excellent treatment. If a base salary must be set out of thin air, and the number exceeds several times the actual number at that time, wouldn't it be excessive? Therefore, in the future, the Social Bureau should handle wages with the actual payment number before the war as the base number. (B) Strikes are not allowed before legal mediation and arbitration. Military and political agencies have already issued proclamations. But in fact, the labor side never abides by them. Each time the industry asks for wage increases, it first strikes. Even more so, the workers do not recognize strikes as illegal, but implement slow-downs. They do not know that if the workers strike, the factory can close the factory gates and there will be no losses. As for slow-downs, the furnace is lit, the machines are turned on, and the factory losses are great. Therefore, the prohibition of slow-downs should be more important than strikes. The military and political authorities should be asked to reiterate the previous order prohibiting slow-downs, otherwise, they will be severely punished. As for applying for mediation, it is hoped that the Social Bureau will investigate the factory's ability to bear the burden, the normal treatment of labor, and the actual wages paid before the job in advance. The matter of finding a middle ground with just a single number in the form of bargaining should not be taken. The labor side clearly knows that the authorities adopt a compromise number, so when they propose it, they deliberately raise it, and sometimes the result obtained after mediation is actually higher than what the labor side actually hopes for.

Mediate Labor Disputes, Focus on Discipline

(C) When mediating, absolute attention should be paid to discipline, and the number of representatives from both sides must be equal. It is best to use the form of a court. Otherwise, the labor side gathers thousands or even tens of thousands of people, while the employer's representatives are only five or six people, surrounded layer by layer, from morning to night. Without food or drink, how can a fair and reasonable solution be obtained? (D) The factory must maintain administrative power, the power to employ people, and the power to handle affairs. The labor side must not interfere. This is necessary for management. (E) The implementation of the law must be comprehensive. One cannot choose to implement the beneficial ones and reject the unfavorable ones. Therefore, in the current labor-management disputes, the labor side often cites the Factory Law, but the Factory Law also has clear provisions regarding dismissal procedures. If the labor side can make demands based on the Factory Law, the employer can naturally handle dismissals based on the Factory Law to show equality of legal rights and obligations. The above five items are all requests that are fair and reasonable based on laws, regulations, and facts. It is hoped that the municipal authorities and the responsible authorities can give fair consideration to them and adopt and implement them immediately, so as to comfort the hopes of all industries and give them a chance to breathe a sigh of relief.

Short Commentary

### Guiding Principles and Methods for Handling Labor Disputes

Labor-management problems, on the surface, seem to be confrontational, but in reality, they are not opposite but complementary. Because if the capital side only seeks cheap labor and ignores the welfare of workers, it will inevitably lead to strikes, slowdowns and other disputes. As a result, the loss of the capital side is often far more than that of the labor side. In the five suggestions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the pain caused by the strike can be described as generous.

As for the workers' excessive demands, making the factories that have already started work unable to survive, and the factories that have not started work hesitate to move forward, resulting in many unemployed, how is the loss of the workers' side?允Do not wait for many words to understand.

Therefore, what Minister Gu said in yesterday's talk: "It is quite reasonable to determine wages based on the cost of living index of workers... but if the production and business situation is not good, it is difficult for the capital side to bear it. After labor-management agreement, or government evaluation, it can also be issued in accordance with the reduced cost of living index," these few words, we believe, are a one-shot shot.

Originally, this principle of using the cost of living index as a principle for adjusting wages has long been adopted by the government. And "requests for conditions, such as those that are not acceptable to today's Chinese production conditions, should be rejected" has also been announced by the mayor as one of the four principles. The content of the kernel is no different from the policy set by Minister Gu. The problem is, how can this policy be effectively implemented?

Minister Gu said: The organization of the labor-management evaluation committee has now been agreed upon and will be established soon. The powers of the committee, in addition to adjusting treatment and urgently handling major labor-management disputes, also include preventing disputes and enforcing powers. For all illegal actions, effective restraint can be given. If it can be handled in this way, I think: the above policy can be effectively achieved. Therefore, we are very welcome to Minister Gu's policy on handling labor disputes, especially his method of handling labor disputes.

### Inquiries at the 8th Meeting of the Provisional Senate: Winning Over People's Hearts Requires Practicality, the Joint Liability System for Opium Prohibition Violates Democracy... Female Senators Pay More Attention to the Prostitution Problem

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning was the third group review meeting of the Municipal Provisional Senate, and at 3:15 p.m., the eighth general meeting was held, with 26 senators in attendance.

Police Bureau Report

Yesterday afternoon, Police Bureau Director Xuan TieWu reported on the bureau's work: Preventing bandit loyalty: (1) Universal establishment of police stations, 126 have been established. (2) Verification of civilian guns, 1,045 self-defense gun licenses have been issued, 70 legal group gun licenses, and 262 attendant gun licenses. (3) Detaining and sending vagrants and beggars. (4) Installing alarm bells. (5) Inspecting hotels and docks, etc. Reorganizing prostitutes: Those prostitutes who have been examined and found to be free of drugs will be suspended with identification, and 2,413 registration certificates have been issued. Closed 29 massage parlors, 108 guidance agencies, ordered to change to legitimate occupations, and stipulated the environment for prostitutes' activities. Prohibiting opium: As of the end of February, 607 people have been registered for provincialization, stipulating that registration will be cut off at the end of March, and cessation will be at the end of June. Strengthening traffic management: Opening one-way traffic, vehicles changed to the right, organizing traffic patrol teams, and organizing Sino-US traffic committee. Rectifying the city appearance: Unifying the county's hanging of the national flag, delineating vendor locations, banning structures, fixing canopies, and unauthorized buildings, and handling lost and missing children. Strengthening household registration surveys, sorting out foreign population cards and the city's house numbers, and verifying foreign passports, etc. In addition, the city's hotels, public entertainment venues, Chinese and Western restaurants, etc. are all within the scope of management of the bureau, and coordinate in adjusting prices and mediating labor disputes. Arresting bandits: From September 12 last year to February 28, a total of 681 bandit cases occurred, 154 were solved, 444 bandits were captured, and a total of 138 traitor cases were handled. Fire fighting and community work: A total of 321 fires have been rescued in the past six months.

The police bureau currently has 89 long police officers and noncommissioned officers, and 2,126 officers. In the past six months, a total of 602 police officers have been confined, punished, and dismissed for dereliction of duty.

Extortion should be strictly prohibited

After Director Xuan finished his report, Wang GenZhong put forward several opinions: (1) The police bureau should change its colonial style. (2) The style of the yamen, the bureaucratic style, formalism, arbitrariness. and the reimbursement doctrine should also be changed. (3) What are the current urgent matters? Hanging flags, installing alarm bells, etc., although they are all very good, have nothing to do with people's lives. The police bureau should win over the hearts of the people, pay attention to practicality, and should not specialize in formalism. (4) Pseudo-police should be quickly cleared and cancelled. (5) The freedom of the people's body and home should be guaranteed, and they should not be arbitrarily arrested and occupied. (6) The organization of the Sino-US Traffic Committee is inappropriate. (7) Martial law and wartime preparations in Zhabei and other places should be lifted. (8) The joint liability provisions in the opium ban are quite unreasonable and violate the modern spirit of democracy. In the future, I hope that the police bureau will use less authority, get closer to the masses, do less formalism, and get closer to practice. Xu YuanGao requested that the police should treat the people with compassion, and that extortion and other situations should be strictly prohibited. Xu ShiHao asked whether the police bureau's arrest and detention of criminals are in accordance with the regulations? Although the shortcomings of the old patrol room should not be repeated, there are also things that can be learned, that is, the arrest of criminals should first obtain a court warrant, and then be sent to the court within 24 hours.

Transformed prostitutes have recently been revived

Zhu SuE made her first speech, willing to speak loudly for the compatriots of the whole country and the next generation of citizens: (1) Although the transformed prostitutes were temporarily suspended for a while, they have recently been revived. Has there been an investigation and further ban? (2) Private prostitutes are scattered in residential areas. After reporting, they are detained for two or three days and fined 1,000 yuan, and then they can be released and continue to do business. What is the way to deal with it? (3) Is the implementation of public prostitutes certain? I hope that in the future, they can be gradually reduced by lottery until they are completely banned. The government can ban prostitution in the same system as banning opium. Lu HuiMin also raised the same question, asking for an investigation to cancel transformed prostitutes.

Police treatment should be improved

Zhao BanFu hopes (1) to improve the treatment of police officers. (2) The number of police officers accounts for one-third of the police bureau's personnel, which should be reduced, and police officers should be increased. Pseudo-police cannot be regarded as traitors in their entirety, and an investigation and identification should be conducted. (3) Road names are not easy to understand, and traffic police should point out. (4) Smoking is not allowed in theaters, which cannot include all theaters. Can the theater authorities determine this themselves? Shen Ding asked: (1) Smokers need to register, what measures should be taken for opium dealers? How to deal with vagrants smoking opium in public on the road? (2) When can the opium ban be truly implemented? I hope that I will no longer hear the term "opium ban" in the future. (3) Some traffic police officers often accept bribes, or open red lights and read books at book stalls. How to maintain traffic? Hou Yuan said that the discipline of the police in the suburbs is too poor, please correct it.

Director's Reply

Director Xuan answered them one by one: There are more than 170 guidance agencies and more than 20 massage parlors in the city. Those who have indeed changed to legitimate occupations will be banned. Passively banning private prostitutes is of little use. The purpose of establishing public prostitutes is to eliminate private prostitutes. The discipline of the police in the suburbs is indeed relatively poor, and in the future, they plan to transfer the police in the city and suburbs to each other. There is a lack of police talent. The training institute can only train 2,500 people each year. Among the current 7,000 people, more than 6,000 are pseudo-police. If they are not used for work, all work will be suspended and can only be gradually eliminated. Smoking in theaters must be prohibited. In the future, 12 female police officers will be assigned to each theater to implement persuasion in order to make up for the lack of police force. The opium ban is being actively handled. I hope that it will not be repeated in the future. Vagrants smoking opium in public has not yet been reported. If it is found out, it will be dealt with strictly. The order to sit down quickly is stipulated by the Executive Yuan, and all localities must comply with it. The police bureau arrests people, and it must be in accordance with the law. Those who cannot be sent within 24 hours are because the investigation procedures have not been completed. The court's investigation work is handled by the police bureau in cooperation. The road signs are the responsibility of the Bureau of Public Works and have been approved by the municipal government. In the future, road signs must be erected at the beginning and end of each road, adding directions. Adding road names to house numbers is not easy to see clearly and has no great effect. The police attitude has been repeatedly supervised and improved. Night patrols and equipment lifting should be stipulated by the Garrison Command. Once the security personnel are enriched, they can be dismantled. The establishment of the Sino-US Traffic Committee is due to the fact that there are many US military vehicles in the city, and accidents often occur. Therefore, there is this advisory body to jointly handle order. Disputes over the occupation of houses are handled by the Municipal Government's Housing Lease Committee or the Enemy Property Handling Bureau. After the police bureau receives the orders of the two agencies or the court, it only performs the due tasks. The meeting adjourned at 6:40 p.m.

Review of Municipal Reports, Each Group Nominates Personnel

The first, second, and third review subgroups of the Senate held a joint meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to review the municipal report and the municipal government's policy guidelines for this year. Twenty-five senators attended. It was resolved that each group should nominate two people to be responsible for the review and then report to the general meeting for reconsideration. Wang GenZhong and Shen ChunHui were nominated by the first group, Xu YongZuo and Xu ShiHao by the second group, and Feng YouZhen and He BingSong by the third group. The responsible persons for reviewing the reports of the various bureaus of the municipal government have also been separately nominated. Ye FengChu and Shui XiangYun are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Public Utility Bureau. Zhou XueXiang and Wu RenCang are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Public Works Bureau. Pan XuLun and Xu ShiHao are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Land Administration Bureau. Qin RunQing and Wang ZhiShen are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Finance Bureau. Wang Bing and Shen Ding are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Social Affairs Bureau.

Military and Police Arrest of Offenders Should Comply with Laws and Regulations

The Shanghai Free Association wrote to the Municipal Provisional Senate yesterday, stating: (1) It is true that most of the military and police agencies in the city transfer suspects arrested or detained to the trial agency within 24 hours in accordance with the law, but in fact, it is inevitable that they will not be transferred within 24 hours. (2) Military and police agencies are afraid of officials. If there is no warrant, they have no right to arrest people in accordance with the law. (3) If they accept suspects who have been arrested or detained, the military and police chiefs in the city often only transfer the case and request that the suspects continue to be detained, and the people's personal freedom is therefore also suspected of being infringed. The system of requesting detention and the method of detaining people without a warrant both need to be adjusted.

### Shen Wanling Sentenced to Three Years; All Property Confiscated; The Shafir Brothers' Case Dismissed; The Prosecution of the Nightclub Manager to be Sentenced on a Scheduled Date

Shen Wanling, the manager of Sheng Sheng Pasture, was prosecuted by employees for being a traitor. The High Court has concluded the trial and announced the judgment yesterday: "Shen Wanling colluded with the enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and provided nutritional beverages. He is sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for three years. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for family members, will be confiscated." When he left the court after the sentence, the prosecutor Shen Adi asked reporters: "How will the property be disposed of?" The reporter replied: "Confiscated." Both clapped their hands and applauded.

Yang Xiguang, the special high-tech detective of Tongfu Road, was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of public rights for life on the same day.

The Shafir Al-Sur and Shafir Daiya Taur brothers, who were suspected of endangering the Republic of China, were also judged by officials as "dismissed in this case."

Chen Huichang and Yuan Shixiang, the managers of Venus Nightclub, were prosecuted for being traitors by Iraqi Willie Kofah. The case was tried at the same time yesterday. It was found that this case had been investigated and questioned by various agencies, including the Third Front Army, the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Bureau, the Military Police, the Enemy and Pseudo-Property Handling Bureau, and the High Court Temporary Court. More than 11 lawyers were entrusted, and the process was unusually complicated. The disputed parts are about to be reconciled, and the traitorous charges have also been debated and concluded, and the sentence will be announced on a scheduled date.

The Criminal Court of the High Court also tried the case of Lü Changmao, who was accused of extorting the people, and the case of Wang Xingjian, who was accused of participating in pseudo-organizations during the War of Resistance.

### Speculative Groups Show Their Skills; Public Bonds Soar and Plunge; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Initially Firm but Later Weak

After public bonds rose sharply the day before yesterday, strong players held their ground. At the same time, they also promoted the legend that pre-war private debts would be repaid at 120 times the amount of the court's judgment, attracting many profiteers. The narrow debt market could not withstand a few tricks. Type C opened in the morning and jumped to 4,400 yuan, soaring to a maximum of 4,600 yuan. Many parties came out one after another in the sound of victory, breaking through the 4,000 yuan mark and falling back to 3,900 yuan. It stabilized slightly at noon. Compared with the previous closing, types A and B fell back by 300 yuan, type C fell slightly by 70 yuan, type D fell by 350 yuan, and type E fell by 250 yuan. Many new Chinese stocks continued to be added. It was stable as soon as it went on the market. The high price of Yongsha was 5,630 yuan, Meiya was 4,600 yuan, and Jingfu was 465 yuan. Other less popular stocks were particularly desolate. Even XinGuang QinXing showed a sense of despair. At noon, the popular stocks were slightly tired after the high price. The noon closing was higher than the previous closing by 430 yuan for Yongsha, 200 yuan for Meiya, 19 yuan for Jingfu, and 10 to 20 yuan for XinGuang QinXing. In the afternoon, the bid price changed from a slight increase to a slight decrease. Foreign stocks fell back after being firm yesterday. Although many parties had the strength to continue to be active, YiSha called out from 13,000 yuan in the morning to a high of 13,600 yuan. Yinglian was not as sharp as it was a few days ago and could only follow the yarn factory. Western merchants supplied at high prices and finally appeared a little tired. The results of the school's previous closing, except for slightly raising a few industries, the rest were slightly frustrated. The paper industry rose more, but fell back by less than 10% yesterday.

### New and Old Hong Kong Dollars Gradually Converging

Foreign exchange US dollars still fluctuate slightly with the gold market. At first, it was at 1,930 yuan, but this price was difficult to maintain. It once fell to 1,910 yuan in the morning and hovered around 1,920 yuan in the afternoon, which was very peaceful. As a result, it was slightly frustrated by 5 yuan compared with the previous closing. The situation of Hong Kong dollars is still very strong. New and old continue to converge. In the middle of the way, both new and old goods showed an upward trend. As a result, the old goods were flat and the new goods rose by another 10 yuan. Robbie Hong Kong Electric are all flat.

### Stagnant Gold Prices

Yesterday's gold market was calm, with temporary gains quickly fading. High prices were difficult to sustain, and lacking any stimulus, there was no possibility of progress in the short term. The market opened steadily, with some activity from retail investors, briefly rising to around 1.51 million [currency unit]. High prices showed some struggle. Although the Bank of China's allocated price was low, buying interest was scattered. Holders gradually liquidated their positions, shifting funds to the stock market. The gold market remained deserted. Before noon, prices fell again to a low of 1.45 million [currency unit], later slightly rebounding. In the afternoon, trading was light around 1.48 million [currency unit]. The closing price was slightly down by 5,000 [currency unit] compared to the previous day.

The unofficial interest rates were relatively relaxed, ranging from 15% to 18%.

### Demand for Strip Steel is High; Orders Arriving Soon May Depress Market Prices

Recently, strip steel has been selling well, especially to can manufacturers, printing factories, mirror factories, and others. The demand from tea tin factories is particularly large. However, despite strong sales, prices have not increased. This is because sellers have placed orders from abroad, which are expected to arrive in one or two months. Consequently, they have abandoned their previous stance of supporting prices and are now eager to sell off their existing inventory while they have the chance.

### Kueiyuan Industry Association to Rectify Sales Regulations

In cases where a shorter credit period is necessary, interest will be calculated based on the duration of the reduction and deducted from the price of the goods. The interest rate will be determined weekly by the standing directors of the association and communicated to all members for compliance.

### Fierce Rally in the Bombay Gold and Silver Markets Due to No Increase in Import Tax

[Reuters, London, 5th] The Financial Times commented on the fierce buying spree in the Bombay gold and silver markets, saying that developments in domestic and foreign politics may be a cause for the continued rise, but the more important factor is the delay in implementing the increase in gold and silver import taxes. In February, the Indian budget already stipulated a gold import tax rate of 25 rupees per tola of pure gold, equivalent to 180 grains, and a silver import tax rate of 8 annas per troy ounce. A financial expert said that Indian domestic prices have diverged from foreign prices, so he suggested that the tax rate should be adjusted from time to time to bring domestic prices as close as possible to global prices in an orderly manner. If the Indian market remains isolated from supply sources, it will be impossible to align with global prices because local production is insufficient to meet demand, and the amount of gold and silver available for sale to India within the Sterling Area is very small.

### US Department of Commerce Prevents the Re-export of Goods from the Philippines

### Coal Market Enters a Slump; Firewood and Charcoal Prices Continue to Fall

The coal market continues to decline, with sentiment weak. Sellers are rushing to sell, and prices continue to soften. It is difficult for the market to recover. Firewood and charcoal dealers have previously purchased goods from the producing areas, and these are now being continuously shipped to Shanghai. As a result, supply has increased recently, inventories have swelled rapidly, sales have become sluggish, and market prices are gradually declining.

### Tung Wood Arrives in Large Quantities; Overview of Production and Sales in Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi

Among the southeastern provinces of China, besides Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian all produce timber. Anhui and Jiangxi are known for producing fir, with Jiangxi fir being of higher quality and therefore commanding a higher price than Anhui fir. The distribution centers are Nanchang and Jiujiang. Before the war, Jiangxi fir was in high demand along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, and timber merchants often went to Nanchang and Jiujiang to purchase and transport it for sale.

Anhui fir is of lower quality, but production is quite abundant, with Tunxi as the distribution center. During the war, fir trees were planted on the mountains along the upper reaches of the Xin'an River. Now that water transport has resumed, Anhui fir is being shipped downstream in large quantities, mainly to Hangzhou, where the current price is 84,000 [currency unit] per unit. With the continued influx of Anhui fir, prices are expected to fall. In Tunxi, Anhui fir sells for just over 30,000 [currency unit] per unit. The shipping cost from Tunxi to Hangzhou is 8,800 [currency unit] per unit, and there are transportation companies providing this service. However, the price of mountain products is rising, making it difficult to purchase in Tunxi. Because Anhui fir has convenient transportation and is cheaper than Jiangxi fir, it is currently selling well in southern Jiangsu, replacing Jiangxi fir.

In central Zhejiang, fir is also produced, but the quality is even lower, and it is mostly small-sized timber. The distribution center is Hangzhou. Besides fir, Zhejiang also produces tung wood in Wenzhou and other places, called "Wenzhou Tung," which currently sells for 45,000 [currency unit] per unit in Shanghai.

As for Fujian, tung wood is the main product, called "Fujian Tung," which is famous both domestically and abroad. High-quality coffin materials are often made from this "Fujian Tung." It has been in high demand in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Timber merchants often go to the mountains of Fujian to purchase it, tie it to the sides of boats, and tow it to Shanghai for distribution to various places.

It is reported that large quantities of fir and tung wood have arrived in this city, so timber prices are trending downward. Large quantities of American pine have also arrived, so there should be no shortage of timber for construction projects in the future.

### US Paper Production Increases, But Still Falls Short of Demand

The United States needs a large amount of timber for post-war construction and building houses, and the increased labor costs have affected the cost of papermaking. The paper produced recently is far below the previous standards. The so-called best quality "Victory Paper" has become a thing of the past. It is reported that the paper production in the United States this year is actually more than the same period last year, but it cannot meet the demand due to the sudden increase in demand from various countries after the war. This shortage may last for some time.

### Chinese Bristles Seek an Outlet to the United States in an Attempt to Regain Their Original Market

[Reuters, New York, 5th] Business sources told Reuters yesterday that bristle supplies are very smooth, especially the arrival of goods from China, which is very beneficial to the United States in meeting domestic and export needs. In the last three months of last year, the average monthly import of bristles by the United States was 155,000 pounds. The import volume in the first three months of this year must be much higher. Chongqing and Hankou are currently not supplying bristles to the United States due to difficulties in labor and transportation within China, but the general trend within China is clearly to regain the entire US market, which was held by Indian and South American bristle merchants during the war. China is currently offering the United States bristle and freight prices of 5 yuan and 5.6 yuan per pound for Tianjin and 2.9 yuan per pound for Shanghai. The prices two weeks ago were 6 yuan, 6.6 yuan, and 3.25 yuan. In the past month, the United States sold a considerable amount of bristles to the United Kingdom, but this sales channel has now been drastically reduced because the British supply department is unwilling to allocate US dollars. The department itself may have a considerable amount of inventory and must use it up first. France purchased a large quantity of bristles last fall, and then it was intermittent, and recently it purchased in the market again.

Therefore, health education should be implemented in schools at all levels to eradicate them. The implementation of health education should not only focus on hygiene knowledge but also include social issues. At the same time, it should also cover knowledge of sexuality and the prevention of venereal diseases. The conference further resolved that admission tests for secondary schools should not be based solely on examination results, but should also consider teacher reports and students' previous activities. After admission, a strict guidance system should be implemented to give students the opportunity to choose subjects. Psychological assessments should also be used to determine students' personalities and which subjects they are suitable for.

### Disaster-Stricken Schools Petition; City Council Agrees to Discuss

[Report from this City] Private schools that suffered during the war, with school buildings destroyed and suffered significant losses, have submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Education Bureau, and the Enemy Property Management Bureau, but after months, there has been no result. Therefore, yesterday morning at 9 am, representatives from eight schools, including Aiguo, Mingde, Boren, and Southeast, went to the City Council to petition for the allocation of enemy property buildings and repair funds. They were received by Speaker Xi Yushu, who expressed great sympathy for the plight of the schools, saying that although there are still surplus enemy property buildings in Shanghai, military, police, and administrative authorities still seem to feel that there are not enough. As for the allocation of repair funds, the government is duty-bound to provide assistance, but given the current financial difficulties, the government also faces challenges. However, education is the most important task in reconstruction and should not be neglected. The City Council, as a representative body of the people, should strive to secure the well-being of the people. He absolutely accepts the proposals and will thoroughly discuss them at the meeting to find a solution.

### Shanghai University Reconstruction Requires 100 Million; Half of the Funds Have Been Raised

[Report from this City] Since Shanghai University resumed classes in Shanghai, it has made great progress. The current enrollment includes 900 students in the university, 550 students in the middle school, and 600 students in the city business school. Since the war, the school has temporarily moved to Tu Ming Yuan Road. Now, because the space is insufficient, the Board of Directors has decided to move back to the original site in Yangshupu. However, the school buildings have been occupied by the Japanese army for a long time and have been severely damaged. All the equipment has been looted. The cost of repairs and replacements is estimated at 100 million [currency unit]. In addition to the efforts of the American Church and alumni, 50 million [currency unit] has been raised. The remaining funds are being actively raised by President Ling Xianyang and the Board of Directors and Alumni Association. The school has allocated 10 million [currency unit] to repair the school buildings initially. The faculty and students have formed a relocation committee to oversee the relocation. All the remaining books, four hundred and fifty boxes, twelve pianos, the existing equipment of the science department, and the faculty and staff families are being relocated in succession. The university will relocate at the beginning of this month, while the middle school and the city business school will remain at Yuan Ming Yuan Road. In order to assist poor students, a work-study program has been registered, which will help the school to organize the relocation while earning tuition and living expenses. This year is also the 40th anniversary of the founding of the school. The students and alumni association are preparing for the celebration.

### Football League First Division Match: Jiao Qiao vs. Jewish Team to Meet Today; 3 pm at Jiaozhou Park

Yesterday was Qingming Festival, and the weather turned cold with rain. It is hoped that the weather will improve today so that the first division football match between the Italian and Jewish teams can be held. Tomorrow, there will be an even more exciting match between Dong Qing. Today, the meeting between the Italian and Jewish teams will be staged at 3 pm at Jiaozhou Park. He Chunhui will be the referee. Both the Italian and Jewish teams are foreign teams. Although this match does not affect the championship, the tactics of both teams are considered quite excellent. They are two of the strongest teams and are worth watching for their skills. Looking at the standings, if the Jewish team wins, it can secure third place. If Qingbai loses to Donghua, the Jewish team can even jump to second place. A win for the Italian team will have little impact. At best, it can tie with the Jewish team for third place. Therefore, the Jewish team has a stronger momentum. Looking at the overall strength, I believe the Italian team should still win.

### Journalists' Small Football Team Established

### Weakness and Motherly Love (Continued)

— Wang Wenxin

Written to Commemorate the First Children's Day After the Victory of the War of Resistance

Love is the root of all life. Without love in the universe, all life would be extinguished. If people only observe and exploit each other, engage in deception, compete and kill, and are cold and ruthless, then all the young will be unable to grow, the weak will find it extremely difficult to survive, and those in danger will be unable to escape death. The human world will only have danger, gloom, and no more light or warmth. Today, war, famine, poverty, ignorance, and various desires and feelings of superiority cause the majority of people in the world to lose their true nature, become cold and ruthless, and only know how to exploit. What can the weak provide for exploitation? They only drift and fall, wander without help, and await death in despair. The continuation of the human race and the vitality of heaven and earth are in grave danger because of this. The way to save them lies first in promoting love among humanity. Everyone should love all the weak with the heart of a loving mother for her child, and support all the weak. "Where can I find a mother's heart to shine upon the lean in the ditches?" Everything in heaven and earth inevitably carries some pretense, but only a mother's heart is the noblest and brightest, automatically emanating self-sacrificing love from the purest place in the soul, without regard for reward or cost. The weaker and more useless the other party is, the more special the love is. A mother wholeheartedly "takes others as the center," sacrifices herself, and helps others to succeed, diligently nurturing them to grow up. "Thirty days of hard work, the mother grows thin, the chicks grow fat." The greatness of motherly love is unparalleled, one aspect of which is sacrificing oneself to help others succeed, and the other is not considering the other party's beauty or ugliness or any utilitarianism, but simply loving deeply. A maternal butterfly uses all its energy to protect the life of a later generation she has never met, placing eggs near the roots of a flowering tree in a warm place suitable for hatching, while she herself dies in the nearby damp soil. Schopenhauer believed that the world's will is motivated by the pursuit of the permanent survival of the race itself, and the highest expression of the sacrificial spirit of motherly love is the fulfillment of the world's will. The tacit understanding, mutual understanding, and spiritual exchange between mother and child also become the best example of human connection. "A mother's face is like the morning sun, gentle and kind; a mother's grace is like the vast ocean, endlessly deep." May everyone take the great love of a compassionate mother as an example, sympathize with the weak, support the weak, and help others to succeed without regard for gain or loss. Then how gentle and lovely will the human world be? May all those who are fathers in the world not allow the most cherished inherent motherly love to be lost even for a moment! May all growing beings in the world take the love of a compassionate mother as an example, expand their sympathy and compassion for the young, and support the weak, and not allow the atmosphere of power, coldness, and gloom to grow again in the human world!

Now, on the first Children's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance, we look at the world where the strong compete and the weak die, and we cannot help but deeply feel that the countless drifting weak cannot be ignored, and the motherly love in the human world is all the more worth cherishing. We respectfully write this article as a call, and explain its meaning to present concrete suggestions to the authorities and those with good intentions:

(1) In future school education, starting from national schools, in language and other courses that contain the function of cultivating morality, the teaching materials on promoting motherly love and all sympathy for the weak and elderly, containing pure and sacred feelings, should occupy a considerable proportion, and at a minimum, should not be less than the proportion of teaching materials that instill knowledge.

(2) In terms of social education, popular reading materials, songbooks, ballads, music, films, dramas, and all artistic creations and performances that promote motherly love and compassion for the weak and elderly should be vigorously promoted and rewarded.

(3) In terms of folk customs, in addition to actively promoting kindness in helping the weak, respecting and helping the elderly, compassion, and filial piety, all habit songs, proverbs, slang, and theatrical performances that involve disrespect for motherhood and playing with or destroying the weak should be eliminated.

(4) In terms of law, a special clause for the protection of mothers and infants should be specifically stipulated in the constitution, and where the civil and criminal laws involve harming mothers and infants, they should be fully protected.

(5) At national transportation hubs and wharves, women, children, the elderly, and the sick should be treated with the same preference as military police and public officials, with special ticket sales, and should be allowed to board and disembark ships and vehicles first.

(6) During disasters and emergencies, mothers and infants in all regions should be given priority in relief.

(7) In terms of medical care, health centers should be established in all parts of the country, with obstetrics and pediatrics as indispensable departments.

(8) Regarding the necessity of counteracting utilitarianism, valuing morality, and ensuring the continuation and prosperity of the race, all countries in the world should adopt the protection of mothers and infants as a common policy.

(9) In the event of war, the abuse or killing of mothers and infants of enemy countries should be absolutely prohibited.

### Chairman Chiang's Full Political Report to the Political Consultative Conference (Continued)

The consultation on the Political Consultative Conference and constitutional principles, especially the principle of amending the draft constitution in the five consultation proposals of the Political Consultative Conference, is of particular importance. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and the final decision-making power of the constitution naturally lies with the National Assembly. However, before the constitution is formulated, anyone in the country, regardless of who they are, can put forward good opinions as a reference for deciding on the draft constitution. The Constitutional Drafting Group of the Political Consultative Conference has already gathered the opinions of representatives from all parties attending, and has decided to organize a Constitutional Review Committee, with the meeting time set for two months.

Careful Review of the Draft Constitution to Provide for Adoption by the National Assembly

During these two months, the work of the Constitutional Review Committee will be based on the principles of modification measures of the Consultative Conference, and will refer to the results of the Constitutional Government Preparatory Committee, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association's revision proposal research, and opinions put forward by various parties, summarizing and organizing them to produce the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment for adoption by the National Assembly.

The Second Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee conducted a thorough and cautious examination of the constitutional draft amendment principles. Before the examination report was submitted to the congress, the representatives of the Kuomintang attending the Constitutional Draft Review Committee presented the opinions of the majority of the Central Committee members to the Constitutional Draft Review Committee for discussion. On the fifteenth of last month, a joint meeting of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee and the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group reached an agreement on the following three items: (1) The National Assembly is a tangible National Assembly; (2) The second item of Article 6 of the constitutional draft amendment principles is canceled, stipulating that if the Legislative Yuan has a vote of no confidence in the entire Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan shall either resign or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, but the same Premier shall not request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan again; (3) Provincial constitutions shall be changed to provincial autonomy laws.

It was not until the sixteenth of last month that the Second Plenary Session accepted the examination report on the constitutional draft amendment principles and decided to authorize the committee to be responsible for handling the examination opinions as the following five items:

(1) The formulation of the constitution should be based on the Founding Program as the most fundamental basis.

(2) The National Assembly should be a tangible organization, exercising the powers stipulated in the Founding Program in a concentrated congressional manner, and the number of times it is convened should be appropriately increased.

(3) The Legislative Yuan should not have the right to consent to or distrust the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan should not have the right to request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan.

(4) The Control Yuan should not have the right to consent.

(5) Provinces do not need to formulate provincial constitutions.

Constitution Not Yet Promulgated, Provisional Constitution Fundamentally Valid

The resolution of the Second Plenary Session on the agreement of the Political Consultative Conference clearly declared the Chinese Kuomintang's sincere commitment and determination to implement it. The attitude of the entire session in putting forward opinions on constitutional principles based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings was extremely cautious. In advance, the party representatives proposed the Constitutional Draft Review Committee and the Comprehensive Group to reach an agreement, and afterwards authorized the Central Standing Committee to handle it, in order to obtain understanding from all parties. All of this is sufficient to show its consistent painstaking efforts of tolerance, concession, and compromise. Unexpectedly, the CCP delegation issued a statement accusing the Second Plenary Session of creating a confusing situation in violation of the Political Consultative Conference resolution. Who is creating the confusing situation and who is creating this propaganda that confuses right and wrong, clear-sighted people will naturally understand and there is no need to say more. However, our government still adheres to the policy of forbearance for the sake of the country and continues to study and discuss with them with great concentration, waiting quietly for a solution. Unexpectedly, the CCP representatives suddenly proposed a motion in the Comprehensive Group a few days ago, which surprised us very much. They advocated that "during the transition period from political tutelage to constitutional government, the laws of the political tutelage period should be abolished immediately, and the organization law of the national government jointly participated in by various parties on the principle of equality and legality should be formulated in accordance with the agreement on the organization of the government of the Political Consultative Conference." I think it is necessary to briefly explain this major issue:

The Provisional Constitution of the Political Tutelage Period is the National Organization Law formulated by the National Assembly in the 20th year of the Republic of China. This Provisional Constitution can only be replaced by the constitution formulated by the National Assembly. Before the constitution is promulgated, the law of the political tutelage period is fundamentally valid. It must be known that a country cannot be without a government for a day, and a government cannot be without laws for a day, especially the fundamental law on which the country and the government are based—the law. Our national government was established based on the law of the political tutelage period, and it exercises its powers according to the law of the political tutelage period. If the constitution has not yet been promulgated, and the law is abolished first, China will not have a legitimate government, and the country will fall into a state of [omitted].

Our government and the Second Plenary Session respect the Political Consultative Conference and have the greatest determination to implement the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference. However, we must explain the nature of the Political Consultative Conference. The Political Consultative Conference is not, in essence, a constitutional convention. The agreement of the Political Consultative Conference on the organization of the government cannot, in essence, replace the Provisional Constitution. The step to end political tutelage can only be taken by convening the National Assembly. If it is to replace the law and become the fundamental law on which the national organization of the constitutional government period is based, then it can only be the constitution formulated by the National Assembly. Therefore, when the Political Consultative Conference was held, the national government repeatedly declared that the expansion of the government's organization this time was based on the existing foundation of the national government, and it requested people from various parties and social elites to participate together to expand the scope of the government, and it was by no means to overthrow the foundation of the current national government and organize another government. This principle is almost known to all at home and abroad, so it can be clearly understood that the purpose of our expansion of the government organization this time is to enable the government to gather the opinions of the whole country, concentrate the strength of the whole country, and win the victory of peace during the transition period from political tutelage to constitutional government, jointly discuss the policy of national construction, prepare for the convocation of the National Assembly, and establish the foundation for the implementation of constitutional government. Among them, there is also a kind of painstaking effort to compromise and seek perfection, which is to lead many illegal facts in the country to a legal track. If the constitution has not yet been promulgated, and the law is abolished first, then the result obtained by the government's six months of effort is not peace but chaos, not unity but division, not a legal track that everyone can follow, but an illegal disaster that everyone can create. This is completely contrary to the purpose of convening the Political Consultative Conference. If the Political Consultative Conference really becomes such a kind of meeting, our government and the people of the whole country will never recognize it. Otherwise, the result of the Chinese Kuomintang's fifty years of revolutionary efforts, the political power that the people of the whole country should get, will not have an explanation, and the sacrifices of our compatriots across the country in the eight-year War of Resistance will not have any meaning. This is not only unacceptable to the government, but also absolutely unacceptable to the people of the whole country.

Gentlemen, what I have said above is the process of the national government's efforts for peace and national construction in the past six months. The national government abides by international law and respects treaty faith externally, and adopts the policy of forbearance for the sake of the country internally. All measures conducive to peace and national construction must be compromised and accommodated in order to implement them. The agreement of the Political Consultative Conference, the measures for mediating military conflicts, and the plans for reorganizing the national army and unifying the CCP's troops are all produced by the spirit of the government's forbearance for the sake of the country. The government has the greatest sincerity and determination to implement them one by one. The most urgent thing now is the establishment of the National Government Committee resolved by the Consultative Conference. We are waiting for the various parties to submit their lists so that the wish to expand the scope of the national government and concentrate the opinions and strengths of all parties can be realized as soon as possible!

### The Famine Situation in Guangxi Province: People Fighting Over Tree Bark and Vegetable Roots; Leading to a "Starvation" Election

Spring has deepened; the hero trees of the South burst into bloom, and petals fall, carpeting the ground in red. In the sorrowful dance of flying catkins, facing this season that most easily evokes infinite thoughts, gazing at the desolate environment, and plunged into the abyss of starvation, people's hearts truly cannot express whether it is sour or bitter. Willow branches are newly grown, and the fine rain has not ceased. The days are filled with a lingering spring chill. Although we cannot see spring snow here, everyone seems to still be standing on the edge of winter.

The terrible disaster has created a calamitous year after the calamity. The disaster victims in more than twenty counties in northern Guangxi enthusiastically welcomed victory, but also helplessly plunged into the embrace of a famine year. On one side, the vested interests and the bureaucratic capital groups are laughing gleefully at the soaring prices. On the other side, the helpless and defenseless farmers are gnawing on grass roots, shedding silent tears. Others have heard enough of the sorrowful cries of the Hunan region and sympathize with the disaster victims near the lake. But who knows that in the areas of Luzhai and Zhongdu in northern Guangxi, every day, a tragic event occurs where forty to fifty people must starve to death? Who knows that the entire county has been fighting for a whole month over the seizure of a banana tree forest (the bark of banana trees is their food!)? The children of Guangxi are too good at enduring suffering. There is no speaker of the assembly to appeal to the central government for them, and the communications agencies do not report on it at all. The refugees are simply enduring the winter and then the spring under the mocking laughter of death. The dead are gone, and the living are waiting to be saved. Today, we want to issue a loud accusation on behalf of the children of Guangxi!

### No Grain in Autumn and Winter, Bitter Starvation in Spring: Gathering Wild Food in Groups

The spread of famine is equally tragic in all directions of Guangxi, especially in the counties along the Hunan-Guangxi railway line. They have suffered once from war and then from insect plagues and drought. Last year, both seasons yielded no harvest. Since last September until now, it is estimated that more than 10,000 refugees in Luzhai, Zhongdu, and Cheng counties have starved to death. There is no grain in autumn and winter, and bitter starvation comes in spring. Nineteen out of ten people have left their homes and gone far away, gathering in groups in the mountains to dig up wild arrowhead, wild water chestnuts, and bracken roots to eat. People have no desires; they just hope to find roots that are slightly fatter and more tender to stuff into their mouths. They will laugh bitterly. Ah! These Bo Yi and Shu Qi, whom no one will pity in this life or in countless lives to come, what is their future? In a village fifty miles north of Rong County, a family of five could not even find wild arrowheads to eat, so the father killed his three children and then committed suicide with his wife. It is truly heartbreaking and tragic! The entire county, including Xing'an, Lingchuan, Guanyang, and even Hecheng and Babu in eastern Guangxi, has long been plunged into a land of terror. A reporter once asked a gentleman from Hecheng County: "Is your county also suffering from famine recently?" The gentleman replied with a sad smile: "Ah, recently? Our hometown has been eating grass roots since last October!" The conversation ended with everyone silently lowering their heads.

### The Gravedigger Said: "Today I Carry Corpses, Tomorrow Who Will Carry Me?"

In the villages of northern Guangxi, people have generally become so accustomed to starving to death that no one pays attention. Those who are tasked with burying the corpses will say with emotion: "Today I carry corpses, who knows who will carry me tomorrow!" When refugees dig for wild vegetables and bracken roots, they often dig up a corpse. However, fortunately, it has not yet reached the point of people eating people. As for the tragic news of fighting over vegetable roots in the villages of Siwei, Heping, and Sanli in the entire county, both sides have long become numb and lost their minds. A village chief said with red eyes: "Dying by fighting is the same as dying from starvation, what use is there for this cheap life!" There is also the news that the Xie Shimei family of seven in Tong'an Village ate wild celery for nine days and died of poisoning, painfully stinging every wounded heart. In Nanlongzhou and even Wuzhou in eastern Guangxi, there is also a type of "food" that must be eaten even though it will definitely lead to death, which is a kind of mud called "Guanyin Powder." It can fill the stomach when eaten, but within ten days, one will swell up and lose their life. But besides "Guanyin Powder," where can the refugees find flour?

### Permission Granted for Staff to Suspend Salaries and Retain Positions: Government Affairs Come to a Standstill

Amidst the sound of grain shortages, there are two more heartbreaking situations. One is that because there are no seeds or cattle for spring plowing (Guangxi's draft cattle lost 75% during the war), tenant farmers are returning their fields to the landlords. The landlords cannot accept the losses and refuse, which increases serious disputes. As a result, neither side manages the land, and it lies barren. The tragic situation of last winter's harvest has not ended, and the situation this spring is so dire that it is unbearable to imagine.

The other is that because there is no local tax revenue, the counties most affected by the disaster can only allow staff to suspend their salaries and retain their positions to seek other means of livelihood, leading to the paralysis of government affairs, the disintegration of morale, and the formation of a state of anarchy, which poses a major problem for public security. Some counties are illegally collecting exorbitant levies from the wealthy in order to maintain the situation, resulting in further impoverishment of the people.

The provincial authorities are not unaware of these tragic phenomena and the serious consequences that can be imagined, but we can frankly say that the provincial authorities are aware but helpless. There are many requests but little action. By the time the money arrives, most of the refugees have already starved to death. Moreover, whether the money will arrive at all is still a question. But then again, how can there be any solutions without money? In the end, it is still the deeply impoverished disaster victims who suffer.

### Even a Spoonful of Rice Gruel is Sweet in the Hearts of the Refugees

Recently, I heard that 5,000 tons of flour have been shipped to Guangxi, and the Relief Administration has agreed to allocate all 140 million yuan of the second phase of business expenses to various counties in the restored areas for farmers to purchase seeds and fertilizers, and to allocate 20 million yuan to build refugee shelters in Guilin. Although there is too little porridge for too many monks, even if the refugees get a spoonful of rice water, their hearts will be sweet. May God bless that those complicated application procedures do not appear, and may the flour and money truly fall into the hands of the disaster victims.

Recently, the Relief Administration also decided to use "work-for-relief" and "farming-for-relief" methods to build water conservancy projects, using disaster victims to build dikes in places such as Jila in Liuzhou, Jinji River in Yongfu, and Wuming and Wuyuan River, and to launch spring plowing by opening the Shapu Farm in Liuzhou on a large scale. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is good to have a plan.

Also, because of the preciousness of rice, Guangxi Province decided to ban brewing. In order to preserve the strength of the fields, it was decided to prohibit the slaughter of draft cattle. Seeing the farmers lying in the rice paddies, desperately dragging the plow themselves during spring plowing, can you imagine that this is still something humans do? But today, nineteen out of ten farmers in Guangxi are doing the work of cattle themselves.

Finally, a piece of news about the food shortage: today, rice in northeastern Guangxi has broken through the 40,000 yuan mark. Tens of thousands of bags of military grain are being transported out of Wuzhou. So-called enterprise companies are钻(zhuān - to drill) their way into the rice piles, engaging in large-scale hoarding and purchasing, using the profits to subsidize the insurance funds of the company.

### The Situ Qiao Couple Came to Sketch: The Drawings Will Be Exhibited in America

In order to record a famine picture for the seven million disaster victims, the Relief Administration invited the famous painter Situ Qiao and his wife to Guangxi to sketch on-site, preparing to exhibit the tragic situation of the Guangxi disaster victims in the United States, hoping to obtain more relief. In these days, taking care of the stomach is the most important thing, and the issue of face can be discussed after one's belly is full.

### "Starvation" Election

In starvation, the people of each county, with empty hearts, are electing provincial councilors and township chiefs while gnawing on tree bark in the atmosphere of democracy. Therefore, those who are enthusiastic about being "representatives" and "public servants" are vigorously campaigning. It is truly "money if you have money" and "rice if you have rice." As long as you vote for me, I will help you solve tomorrow's meal and think of ways to help your family. In this way, the village chiefs and heads of households are having a great time. The "candidates" are hosting banquets today and sewing new clothes for them tomorrow. Considering the value of a vote, the starving people get some benefits. There are all sorts of tricks. What a democracy! If it must have a name, call it the "starvation election."

### University Students Hate Partridge River: Shouting to Go Back to Wuzhou

While everyone is racking their brains over the problem of "eating," a group of Guangxi University students who are tired of living in Liuzhou's Partridge River are clamoring to go back to Wuzhou, and it is getting more and more fierce, even leading to a major strike. At the beginning of the month, they held a large parade in Liuzhou, and at first, people thought they were pleading for the recovery of the Northeast, but it turned out that they just wanted to go back to Wuzhou. Then there was a strike, fundraising, getting cars, getting boats, turning the world upside down. They are still not attending classes. The Ministry of Education sent a supervisor to mediate, but there was no way. When the supervisor arrived at the school, the students posted slogans and shouted slogans. One of them was "The Partridge River in Liuzhou is hell, the Butterfly Mountain in Wuzhou is heaven." The Ministry of Education allocated 40 million yuan for the school to move back to Guilin, and allocated the former electrical equipment factory as the site for the College of Science and Engineering. However, the students are always clamoring to go to Wuzhou (probably because Wuzhou is closer to Guangzhou), and they refuse to attend classes no matter what. As a result, President Li Yunhua was at a loss and resigned in Chongqing. He was succeeded by Chen Jianxiu, who is said to have a headache over this incident and is unwilling to take office immediately.

### The Incense at Yao Mountain is Deserted: The Li River Flows Eastward Like a Sob

It is said that the Guilin Normal College will move to Yongning during the summer vacation, which everyone is very willing to do. Writers Mu Mutian and his wife are still teaching at the Normal College. Recently, a cultural association was established in Guilin, and a declaration of more than 2,000 words was published. The Guilin GOEX radio station, which was quite famous in the past, also plans to resume broadcasting recently. In spring, the only seeds that can sprout are cultural undertakings.

The third month of the lunar calendar is the time for the incense fair at Yao Mountain in Guilin. In previous years, countless devout men and women would prostrate themselves and burn incense. Unfortunately, this year, many grand events have been overshadowed by a sense of vicissitude. At the foot of Yao Mountain, the wind is desolate and the rain is bitter, and tourists are sparse. People's hearts have long been washed clean by the sobbing Li River flowing eastward. Who says that Bodhisattvas are not efficacious, giving people such great suffering? (March 25th)

### Please Abolish the Air Raid Alarms in Our City

Editor: Since the Japanese surrendered and our country was restored, the city authorities have not abolished the air raid alarm equipment that the Japanese used in Shanghai. Instead, they prescribe that it is sounded every day at noon and every Sunday at 9 AM, so that residents hear the sound and are on alert. This method is not good. Here is a list of my opinions:

(1) When the Japanese occupied this city, air raid alarms were sounded thousands of times. Citizens would shiver upon hearing the sound, and many developed heart disease as a result. Now that our country has been restored and there are no actual air raids, we should not continue to let the 3 million citizens of Shanghai hear this terrifying sound, which affects the peace of their minds and prevents them from living and working in peace.

(2) Because the Japanese frequently sounded air raid and alert alarms, many fellow citizens have developed heart disease. Because the current environment has not yet improved, the cost of living is rising, and they are not getting enough nutrition, their illnesses have not yet been cured. If they continue to hear the alarm, even if it is not a wide-scale air raid, they will still be terrified, and their illnesses will be difficult to cure soon.

(3) During the war, citizens would panic upon hearing the alarm and rush to buy daily necessities and food, causing prices to rise. This is a fact. In order to avoid stimulating rising prices, it seems necessary to abolish the air raid alarms during this safe period in the city.

(4) The international situation has not yet completely cleared. If a third world war unfortunately breaks out in the future, then our city will inevitably have to implement official air raid alarms again. Therefore, we should eliminate the current alarms to avoid affecting the effectiveness of future official air raid alarms.

The above points are just a few of the major issues. There are many other related issues, but I will not list them all. I ask that the city authorities quickly consider them. If they confirm that my opinions are well-founded, they should abolish the air raid alarms immediately. This will be fortunate for the country and fortunate for the citizens!

### Small Weekly Newspapers and Social Morals

— Li Sheng

The responsibility of newspapers is to lead social thought and enlighten the people. However, there are many drawbacks. For example, newspapers with colored pictures have other purposes. Also, some newspapers intentionally exaggerate certain news materials for no reason, which only makes readers waste their precious time!

Recently, small weekly newspapers in Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms, and many of them mix news of war with pornography to attract readers. Although there are some that are "decent," they are very few! In this situation of expensive paper, I don't know how much they waste indiscriminately. Not only is this a waste of resources, but it can also affect social morals and give bad suggestions to some young people with weak wills.

For example, the "Sun Lao-Bohrmann" case in the past caused Parisian tabloids to sell as many as 500,000 copies, but as a result, the crime rate in Belgium and Italy increased because of it.

Therefore, I hope that the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau will severely crack down on works with pornography or obscene content.

### Inspiration from the New China: Reminiscences of Ancient Greece

— Gu Liang

Introducing Luo Niansheng's "Random Talks on Greece"

"Greek Civilization," what a headless play it seems! "It is the highest peak of world civilization and the source of modern civilization: modern philosophy, literature, art, and democratic regimes all originated in Greece..." (Page 6) However, despite its simple and accessible language, and the lighthearted depiction of Greek civilization, works like Mr. Luo Niansheng's "Random Talks on Greece" are probably still hard to find in our writings, even though it is just a thin booklet. (Young friends, be among the first to read it; this booklet has been published in the mainland for three full years, but it can still be considered brand new in the recovered areas.)

When we learn about a civilization, we naturally start with its fundamental spirit. What is the spirit of Greek civilization? The author proposes several main characteristics: pursuit of health, love of learning, creativity, love of humanity, love of beauty, moderation, love of freedom. Good health, willingness to work hard, love of "people," love of beauty, love of freedom - in short, a creative outlook on life. There is no problem with this and it can be welcomed. It is only that the point of moderation, at least for most of our young friends, may be extremely unpleasant. However, our author says this: "The Greeks abide by the principle of moderation, they abide by The Golden Mean, they do not overdo things, they do not go to extremes." Moreover, he emphasizes: "This is the secret of Greek life." He also says, "The Greeks are good at reconciling the individual with the government, the soul with the body, the ideal with reality, and are good at connecting two extremes. There is never a rebellious movement in their literature, precisely because their reason and emotion are harmonious, and form and content are in harmony." (Page 13)

Furthermore, there is one point that makes us believe that the Greeks are even more worthy of our love, and at the same time, they are even more "human," even though our author says in such a vague and confusing way: "It seems that only love is not something the Greeks can understand. They even believe that this thing will degrade the nobility of literature, which is so different from our concept. Even now, there is no chasing of men and women in Athens during the day, but at night, they have moonlight every night, and all the young people in the city are paired up, laughing and singing loudly, and even the birds in the garden are unwilling to sleep. This is something I cannot understand." (Page 11) What the author "cannot understand" should be precisely where we can especially "understand" the Greeks.

Despite casually talking about Greece, the author never forgets his motherland from beginning to end in writing this booklet. Opening the door to see the mountain, the first article is "Ancient Greece and China." In fact, this booklet as a whole was probably written in a kind of symphonic mood of reminiscence of "ancient Greece" and longing for a "new China." The author now seems to be in the same mood at this moment, recommending it to our young readers. The author of "Random Talks on Greece" would not think that I am being overly presumptuous in my understanding of his original intention in writing the book, would he? Regarding the point of not forgetting the motherland, I don't want to give many examples and quotes, because all young friends who are willing to read with an open mind will definitely be smart and wise enough to understand the good intentions that the author reveals everywhere. At the end of "Ancient Greece and China," the author made two beautiful dreams. The first was in prose, where he regretted the loss of ancient Chinese art to foreign lands and hoped that "our Alexander will be able to go east and retrieve them." The second was in verse, where he stated that in addition to the Greek influence we have received, he said: "If someone is willing to search on those mountain roads or sea routes, perhaps they can still find traces left behind when the ancient Greek dance troupes fluttered and flew to the Tang and Song palaces." (See page 5 above) That was originally a difficult but important and interesting topic in the history of Chinese dance and music. Perhaps we already have relatively detached scholars researching, excavating, and sorting it out in solitude.

The author "lived in Greece for a year" (Preface). He affectionately reminisces about the scenery there. "Night in Athens" (Article 3) belongs to the same beautiful and exquisite tone as his recently published collection of essays "Hibiscus City" (written about the scenery of the capital): "Nine columns of light, each with a goddess enshrined below... You should remember Erato, who holds a lyre in her hand. At this time, perhaps, someone is calling Erato, which is not someone praying before God, but just someone calling that flower girl. She is holding a bouquet of roses, Roda, Roda (rose)!" "Regardless of whether the weather is good or not, the weather must be good that day, there are three hundred sunny days a year." "But I still advise you to watch Greek comedies and listen to Eastern tunes. The sound is very long, and you have to sing along with everyone. New songs permeate the whole city all night long." (Pages 16 and 17 above)

While introducing the "American College in Athens" (Article 4), the author says with infinite emotion: "Major European and American countries have established classical colleges in Athens. We don't even talk about such facilities, and someone should go back and read some practical books. We now need to read some practical books like this, and this method is valuable." (Page 23) The author's impression of the Greek weather is probably too deep, and in addition to repeatedly praising it, he emphasizes: "I dare say that the weather is better in Greece than anywhere else." (Page 23) I am afraid that our Kunming cannot compare.

After leaving Greece and heading straight for Rome, the author took the time to enter the quaint Sicily and recorded the "Itinerary," which was nothing more than a true record.

"Jiao Da" (Article 6) records a compatriot who has been stranded in Greece for I don't know eight or eighteen years, from Dagukou. Many years ago, he was a sailor on a Dutch ship. Because he was drunk, he missed the ship in Constantinople and was stranded in Greece: the author bravely came forward and tried to help him return to his motherland. And hoped that he would "return to Dagukou to be a fishing chief and spend his wandering life forever; otherwise, he would stay in Shanghai and be a hero." (Page 36) The title "Jiao Da" definitely evokes a wrong association, making people unable to help but remember the clean old brand Jiao Da in front of the gate of the Jia Mansion, who saw the point with one needle.

The above six articles are all the author's reminiscences of that year in Greece, written before the Great War; during the war, he wrote some more historical stories of Greek resistance, collected in this booklet a total of eight articles: "The Battle of Marathon," "The Council of State," "Defending Thermopylae," "The Battle of Salamis," "Alexander's Marching Notes," "Elephant Battle," "Alexander's Injury Notes," "The Death of Alexander" - all are the best patriotic stories, none of which are not worth singing and crying about!

Obviously, in the last three articles, "How to Study Greek Literature," "Characteristics of Greek Tragedy," "Greek Sculpture," what the author hopes from young readers is by no means just second-hand knowledge of the ancient Greek kingdom, but a further understanding. And what the author hopes is: hurry up and read "Random Talks on Greece," and after reading it, you may as well take the opportunity to read all of our author's translations, which he put so much effort into: "The Persians," "Prometheus," "Oedipus Rex," "Iphigenia," "Medea," "The Trojan Women" (Greek tragedies above), "The Clouds" (Greek drama above). All are published by Commercial Press.

In addition, our author also has a new collection of poems "Dragon Saliva" (published by Shanghai Times Company before the war), which is also worth noting, especially in that environment where everyone dared to be angry but dared not speak out, he boldly and blatantly used Greek mythology as if counting his family treasures to develop "anti-Japanese" thoughts and feelings. In short, in addition to the recent "Hibiscus City," our author's creations, translations, and narratives are completely integrated, and the inspiration that ancient Greece has bestowed on him is always active, which is gratifying and admirable.

### Criticism

— Xiao Han

The purpose of criticism is to point out the characteristics of a work. — Simon Tu

It is easy to criticize, but difficult to improve. — Disraeli

Whether it is sympathy or indifference, praise or blame, both will lead readers into confusion. — Goethe

Embrace the criticisms given to you by critics. They are often glory in disguise. — Shaw Bernard

The critic's gaze is like a microscope, only seeing extremely small things. It discovers atoms and dust, extremely small particles, but cannot see the whole of one thing, cannot compare the parts of one thing, and cannot appreciate the harmony and beauty of each part. — Pope

It is simply amazing how critics lack an attitude of humility. — Helps

### Author's Royalties in Europe and America

— Hua Mei

In European and American countries, if a famous writer succeeds, he can get a lot of remuneration. Recently, an American publisher paid Hall Caine 60,000 gold pounds as royalties for his book "The Life of Christ." Although he is not as good as former British Prime Minister Lloyd George (Lloyd George), whose book can get royalties of 100,000 pounds, it is already a considerable amount.

Many writers think that writing is originally a business with no capital, so the amount of royalties is irrelevant. For example, the female writer Austen (Jane Austin) only received 150 pounds for Sense&Sesibility. Hume (Fergus Hume) made a book Mys-tery of A Hansom Cab, and the bookstore owner promised him 50 pounds, so he sold the copyright. As a result, this book sold 500,000 copies, so he had to watch it. It was too late to regret it.

However, monetary rewards are not enough to affect an author's reputation and status in the literary world. Taking Shakespeare as an example, his annual income was only 30 gold pounds, while the modern playwright Noel Coward has as much as 50,000 pounds. Similarly, it is also the case for composers. The famous 19th-century composer Molart was subjected to the King of Prussia, with an annual salary of 40 to 50 pounds, while the 20th-century Menuhin (Ve-hudi Menuhin) got 100,000 pounds a year from the MGM company, but he still refused to go.

Of course, the situation in each era is very different. Molart was also a realistic person. He once said: "What I produce in a year is not worth 80 pounds, but in fact I may produce works worth more than 80 pounds." For example, Macaulay wrote a history of England, spending a full five years, and received a reward of 20,000 gold pounds. Later, Wells (H. G. Wells) also wrote a history of England and received 70,000 gold pounds.

There are also many people who get very considerable royalties every year, but they are still in debt, and this debt is repaid by royalties. For example, Wallace ( Wallace) was still in debt of 100,000 pounds when he died, but in a few years, the debt had already been cleared. His descendants can continue to live on their grandfather's rich royalties, and have maintained it for quite some time.

Most writers are very poor and have little income before they become famous. For example, Charles Dickens (Charles Dickens) sold each chapter of Pickwick for 20 gold pounds, but before he died, his book was worth 30,000 pounds. The one who made the Travels of Wanlifo, Jonathan Swift (Jonathan Swift) got only 200 pounds in royalties, but that was his first full-length debut work. And the first time I got royalties from writing. Swift's unfortunate situation in his life can be imagined.

The famous poet Kipling (Kipling) can get 100 pounds in royalties for each poem. Conan Doyle (Coman Doyle) got 7,000 gold pounds for the Sherlock Holmes case. Law Wallace received 40,000 gold pounds from the book Ben-Hur, and Sir Walter Scott wrote for five years and received a total of 200,000 gold pounds.

Hugo (Victor Hugo) received a total of 160,000 pounds in royalties for his writing life.

The above are of course relatively famous writers. Ordinary writers are very lucky to get 1,000 gold pounds in royalties for a book that took two years to write. A debut work can probably be sold for 30 gold pounds, and a history or biography can be sold for 100 gold pounds, but it is also very difficult to get a publisher to adopt it, unless the content of his article describes is of special historical value, or it even alludes to a kind of official secret, the publisher dares to adopt it boldly.

After reading the treatment of European and American writers, and then looking back at the treatment of Chinese writers, we feel that it is really a world of difference.

The reason for this is probably because there are too many illiterate people in China, and the sales of publications are not very guaranteed, so bookstore owners do not dare to spend a lot of money to buy literary works, so writers who live by selling literature are unlucky. There is no such phenomenon in Europe and America. Their education is universal, their culture develops quickly, and the people's purchasing power is high, so the lives of European and American writers are much better than those of Chinese writers. I hope that China will be able to catch up with Europe and the United States in ten years. Under the leadership of our wise Chairman Chiang, we will start a new cultural life until we achieve our goal! When that time comes, I will write another article "Royalties of Chinese Writers" to today "strengthen others' ambitions and reduce our own prestige." Goodbye! We want to drive away the poverty of Chinese writers.

### The Art of Reading

— Jin Chun Edits

If you cannot recite a book, you cannot achieve the effect of thinking; if you do not think carefully about a book, you cannot get the benefit of understanding the meaning. — Hu Dayuan

The most fearful thing in reading is complacency. — Xu Heng

Whenever I read history, when I got halfway through, I would close the book and think about it, predicting its success or failure. Then I would look back, and if there was anything that did not agree, I would think more carefully. There were many times when I was lucky and it succeeded, and when I was unlucky and it changed. Today, when I only see those who succeed, I think they are right; when I see those who fail, I think they are wrong. I don't know that those who succeed have things that are not right, and those who fail have things that are right. — Cheng Zi

When reading books on philosophy: be happy with the Dao of Zhuangzi, and be self-disciplined with the Dao of Xunzi. — Zeng Guofan

Family affairs are troubling, and I have not been able to read with one mind, but I have set a curriculum and take the time to do it every day, without interruption. After a long time, I will definitely gain something. — Chen Hongke
