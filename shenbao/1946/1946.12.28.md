### Chairman to Sign and Promulgate Constitution Order on 31st of this Month; Offering Sacrifice to the Founding Father When Promulgating the Constitution on New Year's Day

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Presidium of the National Assembly held its final, 31st meeting at 10:00 AM on the 27th. Chairman Cheng Qian attended with more than 30 people.

A. Report Items: (1) Report on the economic expenditures of the Assembly; (2) At 4:00 PM on the 31st of this month, the Chairman of the National Assembly will sign and promulgate the Constitutional Order. Please attend the Presidium and representatives who have not left Nanjing at that time.

B. Discussion Items: The work of the Secretariat of the National Assembly and the transportation affairs for the return of representatives will all be concluded by January 15, 1947.

C. Temporary Motions: Hu Shi proposed that as the Assembly had concluded successfully this time, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen, and all staff members of the Secretariat had worked diligently. Several representatives of the Presidium should jointly submit two points of opinion to the Secretariat of the Assembly in the coming days, requesting that a group photo of all representatives be taken and that a sacrifice be offered to the Founding Father when the Constitution is promulgated. It is learned that the Secretariat has forwarded the above opinions to the Presidium, which has decided to hold a ceremony to offer sacrifice to the Founding Father when the Constitution is promulgated on New Year's Day next year. The original text of the Secretariat's reply is as follows: "Respectfully, thank you for the two suggestions in your letter: (1) A group photo of all representatives of the Assembly should be taken as a permanent souvenir; (2) A sacrifice should be offered to the Founding Father upon the completion of the Constitution of the Republic of China. We immediately forwarded it to the Presidium for discussion. It was generally believed that newsreels have been made of all aspects of the Assembly, and photos have been taken separately according to provinces and units for preservation. They are all awaiting compilation into the National Assembly Record. Once published and distributed to the representatives, they can be kept as a permanent souvenir. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to take a group photo. As for the second point, the National Government has been requested to hold a ceremony to offer sacrifice to the Founding Father when the Constitution is promulgated on New Year's Day in 1947. It will be recorded in the annals. We respectfully report this to you for your consideration."

### Chairman of the Sino-American Industrial Association Requests the United States to Reduce Tariffs, Hoping China Will Take Parallel Steps to Stabilize Currency

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] Mr. Foote, Chairman of the Sino-American Industrial Association, today submitted a "Comprehensive Abstract" to the U.S. State Department to exchange information on the upcoming spring trade agreement negotiations. Mr. Foote represents 400 companies in the association that are directly involved in trade with China. In his "Abstract," Mr. Foote requests revisions to China's commercial policies and tariff valuations, as he believes these policies hinder U.S. imports to China. He also requests tariff concessions on U.S. exports and asks the United States to lower tariff barriers on non-competitive Chinese goods.

Regarding tariffs, he requests that China adopt a reasonable and consistent policy for the valuation of imported goods. He points out that many U.S. exporters have expressed dissatisfaction because China's valuation of imported goods is based on black market prices rather than true wholesale market prices. This measure not only creates instability and confusion but also contributes to rising prices in China. Secondly, China must reform its procedures for announcing and administering commercial regulations. When China publishes new regulations, it does not adequately notify businesses and often fails to immediately inform relevant Chinese authorities, making it difficult for American companies to trade with China. China lacks various types of machinery and many raw materials, so the "Abstract" requests that China make tariff concessions on these imported goods. It also states that the recent advocacy by Chinese business circles for a strong tariff protection policy makes this point particularly important.

Due to the current large trade imbalance between China's imports and exports, the association suggests that the United States reduce tariffs on Chinese imports as much as possible. The reduction of tariffs on Chinese imports may be very limited. Before the war, one-half to two-thirds of China's imports were duty-free, including raw materials such as tung oil, silk, tin, and raw hides. As for dutiable goods, the average exceeded 55 percent of the total. According to the association, this specific reduction in import taxes can promote China's exports to the United States, thereby rectifying China's current abnormal trade imbalance, which is the reason why the Chinese government recently adopted an import approval system. These tariff concessions should especially apply to Chinese handicrafts such as carpets, lace, embroidery, hairnets, porcelain, bamboo products, straw braid, etc. In short, it can include all goods that do not compete with American products. This method was established before the war, but given China's current high costs, U.S. import authorities are taxing these items and several times higher than before the war, thus impacting this trade.

The "Abstract" further points out that sound bilateral trade depends on reducing tariffs on these items. Before China's foreign exchange stabilization takes effect and the excessively high legal tender (currency) price is equivalent to actual purchasing power, there are few remedies for China's import industry. Therefore, the association suggests that while the United States takes tariff concessions, the Chinese government should simultaneously take parallel steps to effectively stabilize the currency.

### U.S. Military to Withdraw from Oil Business in China and the Philippines

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The U.S. Inter-Navy Petroleum Bureau announced today that the U.S. military will withdraw from its commercial oil operations in China on December 31st and from its operations in the Philippines on January 31st of next year. According to the announcement, the U.S. government is withdrawing from the oil business because private companies are now able to transport and establish oil storage facilities on their own. This work was initially notified as impossible at the beginning of the war. Since the victory over Japan, the U.S. military has been able to sell more than 5.5 million barrels of various types of oil to China and the Philippines. This plan was supported by the U.S. industry because it could help Americans rebuild their interests in the areas devastated by the Japanese military.

### UNRRA Relief Supplies to China Not Yet Half Delivered; Truman Submits Report to Congress

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 26th] President Truman recently submitted the ninth UNRRA progress report for the third quarter of 1946 to Congress, and also pointed out the relief needs after the end of UNRRA in 1947. The President's letter stated, "The relief materials of UNRRA in 1947 may reach as much as 750 million US dollars, so many liberated areas probably do not need further relief." The President expressed complete agreement with the State Department's recommendations for handling relief matters in 1947. He said: "The State Department's recommendation is that the urgent relief issues in 1947 should be directly negotiated by the governments of the supplying countries and the recipient countries, and the Secretariat of the United Nations should be used as a center for the exchange of information among the governments of the member states. I completely agree with this approach to handling the relief issues in 1947." He said that the United Nations is actively discussing the relief issues after the end of UNRRA, as well as the important issue of caring for refugees. He continued, "When I submit the next report to Congress, I may provide a clearer picture, reporting on the UNRRA cleanup plan and the supply situation after the end of UNRRA in 1947." As of the third quarter of this year, UNRRA has shipped nearly 16,723,342 metric tons of goods, worth approximately $2,045,035,000.

In terms of value, the materials shipped by UNRRA in that quarter were greatest to Poland, Italy, and China.

This warning was issued by the Soviet port management authorities, not by the Soviet military commander. I believe that this warning did not have the meaning of an ultimatum. The Soviet authorities even allowed a two-hour extension after the 48-hour deadline expired, which is reasonable in every way.

White House Announces Details

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 26th] U.S. officials have further investigated the so-called forced withdrawal of a U.S. warship from Dalian and found that the facts are quite different from what was rumored. In particular, the claim that the Soviet side ordered the U.S. warship to withdraw within 20 minutes is not true. After a U.S. communication ship entered Dalian, the Soviet official in charge allowed it to extend its stay for two hours beyond the prescribed time. Twenty minutes before the extended time was up, the Soviet official notified the U.S. side that the time was up and that he would not be responsible if any further stay caused problems. U.S. officials believe that the Soviet official's granting of extra time for the U.S. warship to stay was a great show of cooperation. He later discovered that his granting of extra time had not been approved by his superiors, which may have caused him to panic and force him to ask the U.S. warship to leave. As one U.S. official said, the incident contained absolutely no coercion or unfriendliness. As for the three Americans on board the ship, they were not allowed to disembark because they had not obtained prior Soviet permission, and the Sino-Soviet treaty stipulating Dalian as a free port has not yet been implemented.

U.S. Newspapers Publish Critical Editorials

[United Press, New York, 26th] Scripps-Howard newspapers published an editorial stating that the U.S. State Department's lenient handling of the Dalian incident, acknowledging the Soviet authorities' right to lower the curtain in the city, distorts the overall situation there. The editorial stated, "The only reason the Soviet army controls Dalian is that the Chinese government cannot persuade the Soviet Union to return the city to China." The newspaper accused the State Department's Far East Division (headed by Mr. Vincent) of adopting a policy toward the Soviet Union that "tried to undermine MacArthur's position in Japan and distrusted the Chinese government led by Chairman Chiang because he refused to make concessions to the Chinese Communists." The editorial concluded, "Until the State Department eradicates this red 'cell,' the United States will continue to lose its prestige and legitimate rights."

### Mao Dun Arrives in Moscow

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 26th] Chinese writer Mao Dun, invited by the Soviet Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to visit the Soviet Union, arrived here yesterday with his wife. The vice-chairman and several members of the committee went to the station to welcome them.

### Siamese Government Limits Overseas Chinese School Registration

Chinese Ambassador Lee Submits Note Requesting Three Points; No Reply Received Yet

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th] (Delayed) Our embassy in Siam recently sent a note to the Siamese Foreign Ministry, based on the opinions of overseas Chinese teachers in Siam, requesting (1) to increase the number of class hours for Chinese language courses in overseas Chinese primary schools to the level before the war; (2) to exempt overseas Chinese teachers who do not teach Siamese from Siamese language examinations; (3) considering the translation of Chinese textbooks into Siamese unnecessary. It is reported that as of the time of this telegram, the Siamese authorities have not yet provided a reply. Last week, the Siamese education authorities suddenly issued orders to the following two largest overseas Chinese schools here, requiring them to register with the Siamese Ministry of Education within fifteen days: Huang Hun Middle School (run by the Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association) and Jinmin Primary School (run by the Hakka Fellow Villagers Association). People in the overseas Chinese education community here have expressed indignation at this action by the Siamese government, believing that this order from the Siamese government is a trial balloon to test the strength of our embassy. A few days ago, overseas Chinese teachers held a meeting and unanimously decided to oppose registration until the education regulations promulgated during the Pibul government era are revised. They also resolved to pledge their support to the embassy's note and, if the points raised are all rejected, to prepare to close the schools. These issues seriously affect Sino-Siamese relations. Ambassador Lee is doing his best to handle the current case and has gained the unanimous support of the local overseas Chinese.

### Killer Police Officer in Wang Shuixiang Case Acquitted

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] The Wang Shuixiang kicked-to-death case was concluded by the Hong Kong High Court a few days ago, but the jury could not reach a verdict due to differing opinions. A retrial was held at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th. The prosecutor stated in court that the police officer, Lin Xingse, was charged with manslaughter, but the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, the European part of the case will be brought up again once conclusive evidence is collected. After hearing this, the judge expressed his agreement and announced the unconditional release of the defendant. This sensational criminal case, which attracted national attention, ended with an acquittal due to a lack of evidence in the eyes of the law.

### Batch of Chinese Sailors Leave Hong Kong for Training in England

### U.S. Rejects Soviet Protest in Case of Conflict Between Soviet Citizen and U.S. Soldier; Believes U.S. Military Police Did Not Violate Discipline

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 26th] Regarding the case on September 23 in Shanghai in which a U.S. Army jeep collided with the car of two Soviet citizens, and it was alleged that the U.S. military police beat the two Soviet citizens, the U.S. government, after thorough investigation, rejected the Soviet protest. A State Department spokesman said today: "The U.S. authorities conducting the investigation believe that the U.S. military police did not violate disciplinary conduct. Since the Soviet citizen in this case was responsible for the accident, there is no reason to demand medical compensation." The spokesman continued: "The Soviet authorities have been notified of this matter." He added: "The Soviet citizen in this case may follow the established procedures of the U.S. Army to claim compensation for the damage to his car."

### Discrimination Against Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Intensifies; Filipinization of Markets Cuts Off Livelihoods of Overseas Chinese Vendors; Free Press Publishes Strongly Worded Criticism

[United Press, Manila, 27th] Mr. Lin, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Market Vendors Association, stated today that the new regulations for managing market vendors in the Philippines, scheduled to be implemented on January 1, will cut off the only livelihood of overseas Chinese vendors. The new regulations have an extremely nationalistic meaning, which is contrary to the position expressed by the Roxas government on this matter. Mr. Lin also appealed to give overseas Chinese vendors five to ten years to switch to other industries.

[Another Cable] Mr. Laxon, a famous columnist for the Philippine Free Press, wrote an article today, harshly criticizing Filipinos for discriminating against overseas Chinese. It is said: "Some Filipinos were outraged and indignant when white brothers began to drive them with the well-known Yankee style, but now they turn around and apply it to the overseas Chinese. Since we insist on being treated equally by white people, we should also treat other ethnic groups the same way to be fair. Even if the overseas Chinese are not superior to us, they do not regard us as inferior."

[Another Cable] Last week, 500 Chinese arrived in the Philippines from Xiamen without proper entry permits. Mr. Faber, the Philippine Colonial Commissioner, ordered 100 of them to be deported today. The remaining 400 were allowed to stay because they had business relations in the Philippines, or had property or relatives residing here. Another thirteen overseas Chinese were accused by the Philippine Rehabilitation and Relief Administration of privately selling stored sugar (all stored sugar in the Philippines is requisitioned by the government). If approved by Philippine President Roxas, they will also be ordered to be deported.

### Mei Ruao Leaves Japan to Return to China

### U.S. Soldiers in Tanggu Commit Murder While Drunk

Old Worker Killed with Wooden Sticks; Residents Hold Demonstration

[United Press, Tianjin, 27th] Yishibao reported today that a Chinese worker surnamed Luo, 53 years old, from Tanggu, was returning home on Christmas Day when he was beaten with wooden sticks by several drunken U.S. soldiers. His left ear was cut off with a small knife. Although he was sent to the hospital, he eventually died the next morning due to his injuries. Residents of Tanggu held a demonstration against the U.S. military because of this case.

### Farmers in Kowloon Decide to Stop Planting Due to Government Control of Vegetable Markets; Fishermen Also Close New Fishing Area to Resist Control

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] Farmers in the New Territories of Kowloon are conducting a passive resistance against the Hong Kong government's control of the vegetable market. Some vegetable farmers have stopped planting and are looking for other ways out, while others have switched to planting miscellaneous grains. The vegetable fields in the New Territories have now become barren land. The Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce believes that vegetables are daily necessities for citizens, and once there is no vegetable production locally, relying solely on foreign imports will have a significant impact. Therefore, they are appealing on behalf of the farmers and requesting the abolition of control.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] Fishermen are deeply dissatisfied with the Hong Kong authorities' control of the fish market and the extraction of profits. The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association recently studied the possibility of opening a new fishing area on Lingding Island, far away from Hong Kong, to avoid Hong Kong's control and develop fishing in South China. They are currently drafting a plan to borrow 300,000 Hong Kong dollars from the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to build fishing village houses on the island and build a huge dam to protect against wind and waves, so as to dock large and small fishing boats. After the new fishing area is completed, Hong Kong's fishing industry may concentrate there.

### Communist Party Representatives to Come to Shanghai

To Discuss Issues Related to the Yellow River Blocking

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The Yan'an side will send personnel to Beiping next week and then to Shanghai to discuss issues related to the blocking of the Yellow River with UNRRA. It is reported that the Huayuankou Blocking Project will be completed next month, but the restoration of the dikes in the old course of the Yellow River and the relocation of people in the old course area have not been completed. Therefore, the Communist Party will send personnel to negotiate with UNRRA for the funds for restoring the dikes and the subsidies for the relocation of people. Huang Hua, director of the Communist Party Executive Department's press office, said that Ye Jianying had talked with Stuart Leiden about the Yellow River blocking problem yesterday, but no new agreement was reached.

### Yellow River Project Funds in Shandong Province

Restoration of Dikes Has Not Yet Been Repaired; People in Various Counties Urge Re-Survey

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 27th] The Communist troops in Shandong province have misappropriated huge sums of money for the restoration of the dikes to build military fortifications. The restoration project of the Yellow River dikes in the occupied area has not been repaired at both the east and west ends. The Huayuankou gate will be blocked next month, and when the turbid flow returns to the old course, the downstream counties will all become swamps. The Fellow Villagers Association Liaison Council of various counties and cities in Shandong province urgently telegraphed the Huanghe Investigation Group to request a re-survey to avoid an unprecedented flood.

### Commemoration of the First Week of Taking Over Shenyang

Shenyang Celebrated Greatly Yesterday

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Shenyang's first anniversary of takeover was celebrated greatly today on the 27th. Shenyang is now the heart of the Northeast. Mayor Dong Wenqi took over the municipal administration under dangerous conditions. The personnel of the puppet municipal government cooperated with him to overcome the difficulties. Therefore, except for the responsible departments, more than 90% of the original personnel are still employed. Mr. Huang said that he had done his best to be friendly to the Soviet army at that time. The Soviet army demanded recognition of its acquisition of property rights, but he finally managed to avoid signing. The current situation after a year is not simple. He is still maintaining the scale of an ordinary city. In his capacity as a representative of the citizens, he hopes to be changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan as soon as possible to seek future development. The Shenyang Revitalization Three-Year Plan will be implemented starting next year.

### Accelerate the Efficiency of Mailing Newspapers

Post Office Has Formulated Measures

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] In order to accelerate the efficiency of mailing newspapers between Nanjing and Shanghai, the Directorate General of Posts has instructed the Nanjing and Shanghai post offices to consult with the newspapers to list the names and addresses of subscribers in the two cities and submit them to the respective post offices for distribution to the personnel sorting mail in Nanjing and Shanghai, and to indicate the delivery post office number separately. A list is sent to the newspapers to print the subscriber's delivery post office number on the cover of the mailed newspapers, and when mailed, they are bundled separately according to the delivery post office number, so that they can be sealed directly and delivered quickly. Special personnel have been dispatched by the Nanjing and Shanghai post offices to step up the process, which will be implemented in early January 1936.

### An Undercurrent of Financial Activity in Chongqing; After the Shanghai Branches of the Bank of China, Etc. Stop Exchanging, the Phenomenon of Increased Withdrawals and Deposits Has Once Again Become Prevalent in the Market

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] After the Shanghai branches of the Chongqing Construction, Chengd, Huwei, and Datong banks successively stopped exchanging yesterday and the day before, a direct impact has already occurred in the market here. Those in the industry who had deposited remittances in the above four banks yesterday and the day before held meetings this morning to discuss the methods of withdrawing the remittances. Because the four banks are all trying to preserve the situation in Chongqing, they mostly asked their counterparts for accommodation with monthly promissory notes. The general trend of depositing money suddenly became prevalent again, which is another undercurrent after the insane rise in gold prices. Even short-term lending among peers is mutually suspicious, so the money market has become extremely tight again. According to people familiar with the banking industry, in the short term, several more banks may continue to stop exchanging due to poor turnover.

Editorial

### Convening of the Frontier Education Conference — And Congratulations on the Establishment of the International Cultural Cooperation Association

The historically significant National Assembly has just concluded, and we see two more historically significant gatherings convened in Nanjing: one is the Frontier Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education, and the other is the inaugural meeting of the International Cultural Cooperation Association convened on the 26th. Although these two gatherings differ in nature and significance, they are both related to cultural and educational matters and therefore share common ground. After the fundamental national blueprint longed for by the people has been completed, the convening of these cultural and educational conferences is indeed very gratifying. Why do we say this? As the National Assembly concluded, we commented on "the completion of the constitutional undertaking," believing that when it comes to the Constitution, "the Constitution itself is not just a set of articles, but a living, vital creation. The drafting of the Constitution can only be said to be its birth, like a newborn infant, it must still develop and grow," and we hope that the people of the country will cherish our Constitution, so that it can grow to adulthood. For the people to cherish our Constitution, it is largely a matter of education. We must raise the educational level of the people, and then the people will be able to cherish this national law that has emerged from hardship. The holding of these cultural and educational conferences following the National Assembly is gratifying, because the result of frontier education will inevitably be to increase the love of our frontier compatriots for the Constitution; and the establishment of the International Cultural Cooperation Association undoubtedly aims to promote international understanding in the cultural field; thus, our fundamental law will inevitably be able to gain general recognition and understanding internationally through the medium of the International Cultural Cooperation Association. All of this is related to the birth of the Constitution; therefore, the convening of these cultural and educational conferences after the National Assembly is indeed a gratifying thing.

Speaking of continuous education, the problems here are not simple. First, frontier education is a rather broad term. Our country's frontier is vast, and the compatriots residing in the frontier are very complex in terms of language, culture, and even blood. The Mongols, Tibetans, Xinjiang people, and the various Yi ethnic groups residing in the southwest are not the same in language, culture, and even blood; they all have their own unique problems. The problems that appear in Xinjiang are not necessarily the same as those in Tibet. However, they are all our frontier compatriots; because they are all frontiers, we must not adhere to our central government's policy on frontier administration in dealing with the issue of frontier education. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee had important resolutions on frontier policy, which began by stating: "It is found that our Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members of our great Chinese nation, and the regions where they are distributed are an indivisible part of our territory. Our party has always aimed to assist and develop all frontier compatriots, joining hands to move forward, hoping that they will all share in prosperity and happiness. ... Now that the war has been won, the responsibility of building the country should be borne jointly by all our compatriots." The resolutions passed in this meeting either involved the need for clear provisions in the Constitution to guarantee the autonomous rights of frontier ethnic groups, or involved the opportunity for frontier compatriots to participate in the government, among which those related to culture and education were: "The teaching in all levels of education in the areas where frontier ethnic groups reside should cultivate the language of the ethnic group, and Mandarin should be a compulsory subject, to be implemented at the discretion of the Ministry of Education. The official documents of all levels of government should be used in both Mandarin and the language of the ethnic group as a principle."

Our newspaper has previously published articles on this frontier policy, believing that: "The resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, in expanding the inherent cultural life of the frontier compatriots, not only shows the central government's concern for the frontier compatriots, but also opens up a broad avenue for their future development. ... Therefore, in this resolution, our country's ethnic policy is becoming increasingly clear, ... the negative significance of this policy is that we have abandoned the assimilation policy with aggressive implications, and in the positive aspect, our ethnic policy is to support the self-development of frontier compatriots, and especially to pay attention to the development of their inherent culture. The Constitution passed by the National Assembly, in its Article 169, clearly stipulates: "The State shall actively promote the education, culture, transportation, water conservancy, sanitation, and other economic and social undertakings of the various ethnic groups in the frontier regions, and assist their development. With regard to land use, it shall provide guarantees and development in accordance with the climate, soil properties, and the customs of the people." It is also now enshrined in the constitution to support the development of the inherent culture of our compatriots in the frontier regions. Then, the focus of so-called frontier education should also be on supporting the development of the inherent cultural life of the local people, and then raising their educational level. Our neighboring country, the Soviet Union, has adopted such a policy; our country's frontier is also adjacent to the Soviet Union; we should especially understand the national policy and strive to promote frontier education.

What we should also congratulate here is the establishment of the International Cultural Cooperation Association. Our chairman specially issued an instruction to encourage the establishment of the association. The establishment of the International Cultural Cooperation Association aims to promote the cultural relations between our country and the international community, in order to increase the understanding between our country and the international community. It is found that the relations between countries are multifaceted, but cultural relations are the most fundamental. Therefore, in recent times, all countries have had institutions dedicated to promoting international cultural cooperation. Even in our country, we see the British Council, the United States Information Service, and cultural activities from the Soviet side. Our country, as an ancient cultural country, is unique in not having such an institution dedicated to this task, which is ultimately regrettable. Now that the International Cultural Cooperation Association has been established in Nanjing, it will certainly carry forward the chairman's encouragement, promote our traditional culture, and increase the spirit of friendship among ethnic groups; then, the achievements of the International Cultural Cooperation Association in the future will certainly shine as brightly as the British Council. As it is established, we hereby express our sincere congratulations.

### Unprecedented Air Transport Tragedy

The tragedy of the three civilian aircraft accidents in Shanghai on Christmas Day occurred on the same day, with only a few hours in between, resulting in more than 80 casualties. This is truly a tragedy in the history of civil aviation. After three days, we have turned from a state of shock and mourning and begun to think. We are naturally very surprised that this series of tragedies occurred at the same time and in the same place. We naturally express our infinite condolences and regret for the deceased. Due to the occurrence of this series of tragedies, people are naturally thinking about the issue of responsibility. Regarding this issue of responsibility, it is quite difficult for unqualified personnel in the aviation industry to make a judgment. Now that the government's competent authorities have come to Shanghai for a thorough investigation, it is believed that in the near future, the responsibility will be determined; we do not need to discuss it here. However, although we outsiders do not need to talk too much about the issue of responsibility and technical issues of aircraft accidents, the fact that three aircraft crashed on the frontier in one day has forced us to consider several points.

First, the severe weather in Shanghai on the day of the accident was well known. According to reports, several aircraft received telegrams about the severe weather in Shanghai and suspended their flights to Shanghai. What we want to consider now is whether the three aircraft that crashed had received telegrams about the severe weather in Shanghai suspending their flights to Shanghai. If they had not received them, why did Shanghai not report it by telegram; if the telegrams were sent but not received, then there must be a problem with the radio equipment in the aircraft; flying passengers directly without inspecting and repairing the radio equipment in the aircraft that has problems; if there is no problem with the radio equipment, then it is inevitably a matter of the discipline of the flight personnel. Everyone is concerned about this civil aviation tragedy and wants to understand something about these.

Second, the flight equipment seems to be a bit problematic. If the airport had blind landing equipment, perhaps such a tragedy would not have occurred; if the aircraft also had parachute equipment, then it seems that there would not have been so many casualties. Regarding these, it seems difficult to absolve the airline of the responsibility of negligence. As for the fog, it itself did not directly cause this tragedy. Chongqing is a famous fog city, and in Chongqing, in the difficult environment during the war, we have not heard of such a tragedy as this.

The dead cannot be resurrected. Due to this civil aviation tragedy, we hope that the government and airlines can equally raise their awareness of flight safety. If the airport's equipment is incomplete, it should be supplemented; if the civil aviation airport in Longhua is insufficient, it should be added. Now that the aviation agreements between China and the United States and between China and France have been signed, and international civil aviation will soon be flying through Shanghai; we must pay special attention to the efficiency of the Shanghai airport. Due to this painful experience, we hope that civil aviation will be safer in the future.

### Jiangsu and Zhejiang Expedite Collection of Land Tax in Kind — Central Government Strictly Orders Completion of Task as Scheduled

[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper] The Central Government originally stipulated that the work of collecting land tax in kind for this year should be fully collected by the end of this year. Zhejiang Province started collecting later, and currently the collection in various counties is only about 30%. Therefore, the Provincial Food Bureau has decided to extend the deadline to the end of January to collect the full amount, but this decision has not been approved by the Central Government. Yesterday, the Central Government sent a strict telegram to the province urging the collection, and ordered that if the collection officials in the counties that fail to complete the collection work as scheduled should be penalized.

[Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] This year, various provinces and cities continue to implement the land tax in kind, and the Executive Yuan attaches great importance to this. It has issued a general order to all provinces to start collecting uniformly from September 15th, and to collect the full amount within three months. It has successively telegraphed and ordered various provinces and ordered various counties and cities to comply. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government received a telegram from the Executive Yuan, ordering all counties and cities to collect the full amount as scheduled, without any shortage of grains. It instructed the Provincial Government to appoint the director of the department or provincial committee members to conduct zonal inspections and urging, and limited the time for the establishment of land collection supervision committees in various counties and cities to perform their duties of correction and to achieve the effect of eliminating malpractices and benefiting the people. It should also report the handling situation to the Ministry of Food at any time.

### Zhejiang Province Plans to Enclose Coastal Mudflats

[Report from Hangzhou on the 27th by this newspaper] In order to increase agricultural production in Zhejiang Province, it is determined to enclose coastal mudflats. In late last month, the provincial committee member Gong Peicheng, together with the Zhejiang Reclamation Company of the General Agricultural and Feng Bureau and other relevant agencies, formed an inspection team to inspect the fisheries and salt industry. Chairman Shen took Sanmen County as the reclamation center, and the team took Popagang, Jiantiaogang, Jiankangtang, Haili, , Panteng, Nantian, and Longquantang as the reclamation bases. It was decided that 30,000 mu of land in Nantian and Longquan could be used to set up a demonstration cooperative farm, with mechanical reclamation. As for the saying that there are 100,000 mu of land in the Huangmen reclamation area, it should actually be changed to the Huangmen Reservoir for irrigation. The large-scale reclamation of mudflats in Sanmen Bay is not economical. It is advisable to restore the old ponds first and engage in aquaculture. The only large-scale area that can be reclaimed is Popagang, and the time for desalination is not long. There are 8,000 mu of land in the Pufeng area. As for the plan to block the Xuanmen Port to create 4,000 mu of land, it is not appropriate, because water transportation and 3,000 salt farmers in Chumen will be affected, and the Shan Port will also cause floods. Gong told reporters that the reclamation of coastal mudflats to improve the lives of coastal fishermen is not only an important economic task in Zhejiang Province, but also concerns national defense and national reputation, so it is hoped that it will be carried out as soon as possible. The winter fishing season has arrived, and due to the impact of the war, 5,000 to 6,000 fishing boats from Fujian fishermen who have not come to the Zhoushan Islands and other places to fish in the past eight years have appeared in the Zhejiang Sea. Their skills are better than those of the Zhejiang people, and the harvest can be abundant. However, there is no fish and salt, so the Salt Bureau quickly abandoned the distribution of thousands of dans to help production. As for the fishery protection team, it has been established in Songmen, Shitang, Chumen, and other places.

### Agreement Reached on Wuxi Councilor Election Quotas

[Report from our Wuxi Office] The quota of councilors for the war 　 support groups is based on the number of members: the labor union receives 22 seats, the Chamber of Commerce 5, and the farmers' association 12. The Chamber of Commerce's small quota is due to underreporting 2,000 members. Recently, the election was postponed due to the unresolved dispute over the quota of councilors for industry, commerce, and agriculture. Currently, the county provisional council, county party headquarters, and county government have negotiated and persuaded the labor union to cede two councilor seats and the farmers' association to cede one, transferring them to the Chamber of Commerce's quota. This situation was telegraphed to the provincial government for approval yesterday. Once 　 approval is received, the election will be held.

However, the command has recently received numerous reports of irregularities and bribery by township and village chiefs during the procedures for drafting and conscripting able-bodied men, which seriously affects the national conscription system. If such heinous acts are not punished, the foundation of conscription cannot be sound. The command has now secretly dispatched officers to investigate thoroughly. If evidence is found, arrests will be made and the matter will be strictly handled.

### Strange Event on Christmas Eve in Changshu: Thousands of Wild Ducks Fall from the Sky

[Report from our Changshu Office] Here, on Christmas morning, a thick fog prevailed, followed by drizzle after 10 AM, which continued until nightfall. The atmospheric pressure was low. Unexpectedly, starting at 6:30 PM, startled birds (wild ducks) began falling from the sky in succession, in great numbers. The first to notice were staff at the Xin Zhuangyuan Restaurant in the northern part of the city, who collected fifteen ducks in a short time. The incident caused a sensation far and wide, with people scrambling to find them. After 8 PM, even more fell, numbering in the thousands. Some were alive and some were dead when they landed, causing a city-wide commotion and becoming a strange tale. The male birds had emerald green feathers on both sides of their heads and their entire bodies were brilliantly colored, weighing about a pound. The females were smaller, slightly dark gray. The reason for the fall varies according to different people's opinions, and a comedy of "catching wild ducks" unfolded in every corner of the city. Because residents could cook them for meals, they formed groups, holding electric torches and searching widely in the rain. They were particularly numerous in the downtown area of Shimei, Old County Field, and the Altar. The Greater China Hotel alone obtained more than twenty ducks. Numerous ducks also fell on the rooftops of newspaper offices. Until after midnight, there were still sporadic falls and searches. In the area in front of the temple, some even claimed it was a Christmas gift from Santa Claus, while others said that a beauty like Xi Shi was about to be born in the town, hence the phenomenon of falling wild geese.

When Will Agricultural Machinery Be Distributed?

It has been found that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) plans to distribute agricultural machinery. After the victory, the cooperatives in our county successively submitted requests for distribution to the Su-Ning Branch. However, the responses they received were all along the lines of “unified allocation.” To date, no cooperative has been allocated these machines. Newspapers frequently report on agricultural machinery arriving and plans to revitalize agriculture. Why has no distribution been seen yet? Several cooperatives received official documents regarding this so-called unified allocation at the time, and joyfully convened member meetings to make reports. The farmers believed it to be true, and they all waited for foreign agricultural machinery to work for our rural areas. The time has quickly passed, and the second year's work is about to begin, but there is still no news about the requested machines. We specially request your newspaper to publish this, asking relevant agencies to formally respond and tell us when this relief agricultural machinery can be distributed, so as not to disappoint the farmers! (Gong Xiaofang, United Cooperative of Wuxi County)

Two Responses Regarding Student Matters

1. Reply to Mr. Zhou Guoliang (1) Most universities allow students holding distribution certificates from the Ministry of Education to register, but there are exceptions, such as National Wuhan University, which requires students holding distribution certificates from the Ministry of Education to have a diploma from an experimental high school. Also, students who have not graduated from high school should declare to the university authorities when registering that they were admitted to the university with equivalent educational qualifications. (2) A distribution certificate from the Ministry of Education cannot be regarded as an academic qualification certificate; it only proves that the student holding the distribution certificate is qualified for admission.

2. Reply to Mr. Gu Fan (1) The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has approved the registration of the private Hongyi Middle School, and the Bureau is now submitting it to the Ministry of Education for verification. Once the registration is approved, the graduation diplomas submitted by the school will be stamped and returned by the Bureau. (2) Since you are missing a semester of schooling and falsely reported a semester of schooling, if discovered by the authorities, it will naturally become a major problem, and there is no remedy.

Exchange of Notes

I. Note from US Ambassador to China Leighton Stuart to Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shih-chieh

With reference to the air transport agreement concluded this day between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of China, my Government understands that the following points have been agreed upon in addition:

(A) Pending the enlargement and improvement of the facilities of the Tientsin airport to an extent adequate to accommodate aircraft operating on the international routes specified in the above-mentioned Agreement which designate Tientsin as a point on the air route, the Chinese Government will permit aircraft operating on this route to make use of the Peiping airport for international air transport purposes.

(B) Any United States air carrier designated to operate on route (2) and (3) included in paragraph (A) of the Annex may, at the option of the United States Government, serve Hong Kong instead of Canton; provided, however, that the designated United States air carrier may not operate local air services between Hong Kong and any one of the points in Chinese territory mentioned in the Annex to the Agreement. Should the United States Government elect to designate Canton instead of Hong Kong, the United States air carrier designated to operate on route (2) included in paragraph (A) of the Annex shall have the right to connect at Canton with its trans-Pacific route. Chinese air carriers designated to operate on routes (1) and (2) included in paragraph (B) of the Annex shall also have the right to connect at San Francisco.

(C) The United States Government would like to have United States air carriers granted rights to operate to and from other points within China on international air routes in addition to those provided for in the Agreement. The Chinese Government does not at present contemplate the addition of any such points but is prepared to give the matter prompt consideration when the situation is appropriate.

(D) As soon as air carriers of any third country are granted rights to operate to and from additional points within China, United States air carriers shall be accorded the same rights. On a reciprocal basis, Chinese air carriers shall likewise be granted rights to operate to and from additional points within the United States.

(E) The phrase "and beyond" as used in the Annex to the Agreement means that the designated routes may be extended beyond the boundary of the territory of the Contracting Party in question to a point or points in another country or countries. The use of this phrase should not be interpreted as requiring that either Contracting Party must authorize additional points within its territory.

(F) The United States Government agrees that if at any time the United States enters into an agreement with any other country adopting the method of pre-determination of frequencies or capacity, it will enter into a similar agreement with the Chinese Government.

### Vietnamese Nationalist Party Leader Expresses Determination to Fight for Independence to the End, Willing to Reconcile with Ho Chi Minh and Organize a Coalition Government, to Negotiate Favorable Agreements with France

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 26th] A senior member of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party recently told our reporter that the Vietnamese Nationalist Party is prepared to reconcile with the government led by President Ho Chi Minh and fight France to the end for their common cause. The Vietnamese Nationalist Party has begun negotiations with the coalition government to establish a united front. The previous war in the Lao Cai region has stopped. If it is necessary for the interests of Vietnam, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party 　 will form a coalition government with President Ho Chi Minh to negotiate favorable agreements with France. Regarding the relationship between Vietnam and France, the Vietnamese people are eager to stop the bloodshed and establish an agreement with France. If France is willing to grant Vietnam the status of an autonomous region and then grant it independence within the French Union, this agreement can be concluded. If France can agree in principle to Vietnam sending diplomatic representatives abroad, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party will also be satisfied and will only request the right to send consuls to Vietnam's neighboring countries in the shortest possible time. Regarding the referendum in Cochinchina, if the mixed committee of France, Vietnam, and Cochinchina can guarantee a free vote, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party will accept the result of the vote. However, there is a minority ethnic group in the central highlands of Cochinchina with backward education and culture, making it impossible to hold a referendum, which is a thorny issue. Conversely, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party cannot accept any solution that prevents Vietnam from retaining the southern highlands of central Vietnam, but this issue is not unsolvable. The Vietnamese Nationalist Party is eager to revise the Franco-Vietnamese agreement signed on March 6 of this year, especially regarding the issue of ethnic minorities, but the Vietnamese Nationalist Party is prepared to accept the establishment of a customs union between France and Vietnam. In short, Vietnam is prepared to guarantee France's economic and cultural interests and is willing to cooperate faithfully with France to develop Vietnam. It is reported that the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party is former Foreign Minister Nguyen Tuong Tam, who is now in Nanjing, advocating the establishment of a "National Front Government" and may be appointed Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

### Viet Minh Forces Launch Fierce Counteroffensive in Hanoi Suburbs; Moutet Refuses to Cede Territory to Viet Minh

[United Press International, Saigon, 27th] French military authorities here announced that French forces had repelled fierce counterattacks by Viet Minh troops in several areas of northern Vietnam. A communiqué stated that Viet Minh forces were unusually active in Hanoi, launching counterattacks at several locations, but were repelled with losses on both sides. It was reported that eight Japanese were among the Viet Minh troops killed.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Viet Minh Radio claimed that the Viet Minh Republic government moved out of Hanoi last week to Ha Dong, 13 kilometers southwest of Hanoi. A French military communiqué stated that fierce fighting took place on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in Nam Dinh, 80 miles southeast of Hanoi. French forces held their positions and inflicted heavy casualties on Viet Minh forces. The Gia Lam airfield outside Hanoi was also attacked by Viet Minh forces, but all attacks were repelled by French forces. Viet Minh forces have also disappeared from the 32-kilometer supply route between Hanoi and Ba Ninh. Many Viet Minh strongholds in Haiphong have been captured by French forces. Recent dispatches from Saigon stated that French forces in Hanoi encountered fierce resistance from Viet Minh forces in their mopping-up operations.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 27th] French Colonial Minister Moutet declared here today that any attempt to cede even a small portion of southern or central Vietnam to the Viet Minh Republic without consulting the local people should be rejected.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 27th] Various Vietnamese groups today jointly petitioned Moutet, calling for peace, stating that an immediate cessation of conflict is the only way to prevent the destruction of Vietnam and protect French interests.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] A dispatch from Saigon stated that after arriving in Saigon, French Colonial Minister Moutet met with French High Commissioner d'Argenlieu, French military commander in Vietnam Valluy, and his Chief of Staff, Lecocq. He also met with Major Bellanger, who had just arrived in Saigon from the Hanoi war zone, and thus gained a full picture of the situation in Vietnam. After Moutet arrived in Saigon, he was welcomed by Le Van Hoach, President of the Provisional Government of Cochinchina, who, along with his staff, reported on the activities of Viet Minh elements in southern Vietnam. Moutet told reporters that his stay in Vietnam would be very short, and he hoped to return home to report to the government by January 16th.

### Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Clarifies Various Points Regarding Sino-French Relations

[Reuters, Nanking, 27th] Sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here stated that negotiations between China and France regarding the establishment of neutral zones for overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong are progressing satisfactorily, and the French authorities in Hanoi have paid close attention to protecting overseas Chinese in the area. The Ministry has not received detailed reports regarding the safety of overseas Chinese in Nam Dinh, where French defense forces are in a precarious situation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also denied reports in the "Ta Kung Pao" that negotiations between China and France regarding the transfer of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to China had stalled due to significant differences of opinion, stating that negotiations are proceeding smoothly and the two sides are gradually nearing agreement.

### Assignment of Responsibility for the War: Viet Minh Says the Blame Lies with the French; French Say Viet Minh Premeditated the Action

[United Press, Saigon, 27th] A secret radio station of the Vietnamese People's Republic broadcast a message on Christmas Day, blaming the French for the outbreak of war in Hanoi. The message stated that the French presented an ultimatum on December 19th, demanding that the Vietnamese People's Republic transfer power to the French, thus initiating the war.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] French Foreign Ministry officials believe that the war in Vietnam was a premeditated action by the Viet Minh. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Viet Minh attack on December 19th was a premeditated act of aggression. Before launching the aggression, the Viet Minh government deliberately created a more relaxed relationship between France and Vietnam to lower the guard of the French authorities.

### Resolving the Vietnam Situation Without Bloodshed: A Glimpse of French Newspaper Opinions

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The Vietnam situation continues to be a topic of debate in Parisian newspaper editorials. Left-wing newspapers denounced the use of force in Vietnam and called for the recall of French High Commissioner d'Argenlieu to Vietnam. For example, "France-Soir" stated, "Protecting the lives of French people does not require bloodshed and forcing the Viet Minh government to surrender unconditionally. This goal can be achieved simply by ceasing to enslave the Viet Minh people and replacing it with a democratic approach. Furthermore, the recall of High Commissioner d'Argenlieu would ease the situation." Conversely, People's Republican Movement leader Schuman defended d'Argenlieu in an article published in "Le Monde," stating, "Some people like to talk about eliminating fascism. Now, in the Vietnam war, Japanese officers have been found among the aggressors, showing that residual forces still exist. We still remember the French army previously collecting evidence of Japanese atrocities. Can the Cha Son incident, which involved an attack, also be blamed on d'Argenlieu?"

### French Troopships Sail to Vietnam

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 27th] The French cruiser "Duquesne" passed through the Suez Canal today en route to Vietnam.

[United Press, Paris, 26th] The giant passenger ship "Île de France," converted into a transport ship during the war and originally intended to be reconverted into a passenger ship, will, according to an announcement by the authorities, change plans and sail to North Africa this week, and then to Toulon to transport 9,000 troops to Vietnam as reinforcements.

### Atomic Energy Commission Passes Technical Section of Report; Soviet Attitude Remains Ambiguous

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] The Political Committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting today and passed the technical section of its report by a majority of ten votes, with the Polish representative abstaining. Soviet representative Alexandrov stated that the Soviet delegation had not had time to study the contents of the report and therefore did not participate in the voting. The technical section of the report passed today is fifty pages long and is divided into five chapters: (1) a comprehensive report on the work of the Atomic Energy Commission since its establishment; (2) technical issues of controlling atomic energy; (3) various recommendations—this section is blank and will be filled in after the Executive Committee agrees on a control system; (4) the report submitted by the Expert Committee; (5) the report on the talks conducted by the representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission. From this, it can be seen that because the third chapter is blank, the content of the report passed today is purely technical and does not propose any recommendations on the system of controlling atomic energy. The plan drafted by US representative Baruch is scheduled to be submitted to the Executive Committee tomorrow along with Canada's recommendations. It is heard that Canadian representative McNaughton has returned home to consult with government authorities and is expected to return here tomorrow. The attitude of the Soviet representative remains an unknown factor. Although Soviet representatives Gromyko and Alexandrov have both refused to participate in the discussion, they will have to take a firm stance because the report must be submitted to the Security Council by December 31st.

### Viet Minh Representative in India Calls on Indians to Support; Soviet Union Watches Developments in Vietnam

[Reuters, New Delhi, 26th] Mai The Chau, representative of the Viet Minh Republic in India, said tonight that General LeClerc's troops, along with more planes, tanks, warships, and paratroopers, are being sent to Vietnam. General LeClerc was the person who occupied Vietnam in 1945 with the help of the British Indian Army. Due to the large-scale French offensive, the Viet Minh Democratic Republic is in grave danger, and it is hoped that Indian compatriots will rise up to support it.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] A Soviet radio commentator today criticized the Vietnam conflict for the first time. He stated, "The situation in Vietnam has undergone a serious change, attracting worldwide attention. Previously, in 1944, France formally allowed Vietnam autonomy within the French Union, and made the same statement after Vietnam's liberation. The implementation of this decision is in line with the spirit and principles of the United Nations, but it is still not enough to prevent the outbreak of conflict, and the disturbances are increasing. In March of this year, French Commissioner in Vietnam d'Argenlieu and Vietnamese Republic President Ho Chi Minh signed an agreement ending military actions between France and Vietnam, and recognizing the Viet Minh as a free republic. Later, on July 6th of this year, France and Vietnam held negotiations in Paris to discuss bilateral relations, but opinions were very divided until September 14th, and a temporary agreement was subsequently signed. Since then, Franco-Vietnamese relations have deteriorated, followed by military conflicts within Vietnam." The commentator concluded by quoting French left-wing newspapers as saying that French democrats are anxious about the bloodshed in Vietnam, and all friends of peace and security share this feeling.

### Greek-Bulgarian Relations Tighten Again; Guerrillas Use the Bulgarian Border as Cover, Appearing and Disappearing Unpredictably; Greek Government Will Pursue When Necessary

[Reuters, Athens, 26th] The Greek government revealed that the commander of the Greek army brigade in Drama, 25 miles south of the Bulgarian border, sent a message to the Bulgarian authorities in Nevrokop, stating that guerrillas were using Bulgaria as a base. A week ago, guerrillas entered Greek territory from Bulgaria to harass it, but when Greek troops pursued them, they fled back into Bulgaria. The Greek commander warned the Bulgarian authorities that if such incidents occur again, Greek troops will continue to pursue them directly into Bulgarian territory. Official sources here also revealed that the Greek army authorities in Drama requested that the Bulgarian military commander come to negotiate border control matters, but the Bulgarian commander refused to meet, claiming that he had not received instructions from the central government. Greek Deputy Prime Minister Gonatas has returned to Athens after inspecting the northern border region. At the same time, the Greek government announced the formation of three cavalry units dedicated to suppressing bandits.

### Korean Expert Offers Security Strategies; Division of North and South Hinders Reconstruction; US and Soviet Troops Should Withdraw Immediately

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Kim Yong-in, chairman of the Korean Problems Research Association, issued two articles today, calling for the immediate and simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea. He stated: "A year ago, the three major powers met in Moscow and guaranteed the restoration of Korea's independence. We have never accepted the three powers' resolution to implement a five-year trusteeship over Korea. Currently, Korea is divided into two occupation zones, north and south, which hinders economic, political, and social reconstruction. I feel compelled to speak out about this. I hereby make the following requests: First, the demarcation line should be abolished. Second, Korea should be allowed to establish a provisional government without interference from the United States and the Soviet Union. Third, US and Soviet troops should withdraw immediately. Fourth, the provisional government has the right to hire foreign advisors. Fifth, the US, Soviet Union, UK, and China should guarantee Korea's sovereignty and guarantee to relinquish their political and economic privileges in Korea."

### Television: A New Campaign Weapon; Will Exert Its Effectiveness for the First Time in the Next US Presidential Election

[United Press, New York, 26th] David Sarnoff, President of the Radio Corporation of America, said today that television will exert a significant effect for the first time in the 1948 presidential election, and the technology of campaign movements may also change as a result. Party conventions and presidential candidates can be captured by television cameras at that time. In 1924, Coolidge, Davis, Dawes, Cox, and Bryan were the first to use radio to deliver campaign speeches, which was widely regarded as miraculous as they could reach the public broadly, and campaign technology was greatly changed as a result. Television will be studied in the same way next year to make it an even more effective campaign tool in the 1948 presidential election, using both audio and video via radio transmission, and it will certainly be a further step in democratic institutions.

### US House Investigating Committee Accuses the US Communist Party of Ambition

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] The House Un-American Activities Committee, through its consultant Adamson, has submitted a report accusing the American Communist Party of attempting to gain political control of the United States and intending to foment revolution through general strikes.

(2) The Communist Party is engaged in organizing various political groups, whose ultimate goal is to overthrow the current government. Adamson also told reporters that the activities of Elliott Roosevelt, son of the late President Roosevelt, who recently returned from the Soviet Union, should be investigated to determine whether he has exceeded the scope of the Logan Act. This law prohibits US citizens from contacting foreign officials without legal permission in order to influence US foreign policy.

### Looking Back in Discomfort: The Far East Military Tribunal Screens Japanese Propaganda Films

Japanese Troops More Brutal Than Beasts

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued to try war criminals today, screening four reels of Japanese propaganda films, accompanied by commentary from survivors in the films. According to Dutch Deputy Prosecutor Dasselaar, the original films were sent to Australia to film the actual conditions in the Java prisoner-of-war camps. United Nations prisoners and detainees were forced to participate in the performances, and if they did not obey the orders of the Japanese directors, they were threatened with the starvation of their companions. The Japanese actors all performed in the best Hollywood style, with scenery, music, and abundant food and drink. A modern hospital was also filmed, equipped with the latest scientific equipment. The film was shot in 1942, when the Japanese army still dreamed of conquering Australia, and intended to use the film as propaganda to make Australians know that it was better to be under Japanese rule than to continue fighting. The luxurious Indonesian hotel in Batavia in the film was actually the location of the Japanese high command, and its large kitchen was used as the kitchen in the prisoner-of-war camp. Fish and meat were piled up like mountains, but in fact the prisoners could only see it being cooked and smell the aroma, and could not touch it at all, only for the enjoyment of the Japanese army. When filming this film, the Japanese army selected prisoners with better appearances in the Java concentration camps and ordered them to act. In reality, the prisoners were starving and had been hungry for half a year. After filming, the Japanese army drove them back to the dirty and unsanitary huts with bayonets and stripped them of their clothes. One scene was of Dutch prisoners seeing their families. The Japanese army searched for relatives of the prisoners in the concentration camps to make the performance realistic. When the camera stopped, the fathers, sons, husbands, and wives who had reunited for the first time since the Japanese occupied Java were immediately dragged away, and many never saw each other again.

### Where Is Vandenberg Going? Three Major Issues Remain to Be Resolved

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg is one of six people who may be elected president in 1948, and is also the key to US foreign policy in 1947. After the Republican Party won the election, he told the world that the US foreign policy would not change. However, Americans or people around the world have not forgotten that five years ago he was a famous isolationist who voted against conscription and the Lend-Lease Act. Based on his past political views, there are still three major issues that need to be answered in his future speeches:

(1) Isolationism: Vandenberg was still an isolationist at the time of the Pearl Harbor incident, but in a few months, he completely changed his style, admitted his past mistakes. Today, he and Byrnes are the founders of "bipartisan policy," but Vandenberg is the disciple of Senator Borah, the founder of American isolationism. Borah should bear a large part of the responsibility for the failure of the League of Nations. Whether Vandenberg will completely abandon his deep-rooted isolationist thinking in the future is still a question.

(2) Internationalism: Due to the progress of the war and the post-war tense situation, Vandenberg's concept of internationalism has become stronger. It is now generally known that he has exerted significant pressure on his Republican Party regarding some foreign policies, but not all of these pressures have been effective. For example, in the case of the Anglo-American loan, Vandenberg personally expressed his support, but most of the Republican Party opposed it. It is expected that when Congress discusses increasing the capital of the Export-Import Bank by $1.25 billion, most Republican members will oppose it, and Vandenberg himself has recently stated that the United States does not have enough financial resources to be a permanent donor to the world. Will Vandenberg support Byrnes at that time? Or agree with the opinion of Republican domestic policy expert Taft? The facts remain to be seen.

(3) Another issue is Vandenberg's past position in international trade policy. When Vandenberg adopted an isolationist stance, he strongly advocated that tariffs should be based on the difference between domestic and foreign production values. Today, the Republican Party still adopts this traditional tariff policy, which is in direct contrast to the tariff freedom policy of Byrnes and others. Vandenberg claims to have a bipartisan policy, but where he will go on this major economic policy remains to be seen. It is expected that answers to the above questions will be obtained in the first few months of the new year.

### World Bank With Capital of 8 Billion US Dollars

... To separate international economics from international politics is an extremely difficult matter, as it has been in the past and remains so today.

The political disputes among nations controlled by the United States and the Soviet Union have hindered the smooth progress of the new World Bank's lending operations.

The World Bank's recent decision not to release relief loans is clearly related to the United States' dissatisfaction with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Due to UNRRA's international nature, although the United States contributed a large amount of money and supplies, it could not control their distribution. Therefore, when the United States had a dispute with Yugoslavia, even at its worst, UNRRA's relief supplies continued to flow to Yugoslavia. For this reason, American officials were clearly unwilling to repeat the same mistake when the World Bank opened.

When the United States Congress next convenes, some may advocate for "direct aid" to Greece, Italy, and Austria to compensate for the shortcomings left after UNRRA's work ends. However, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and other Eastern European countries are considered capable of managing on their own, at most receiving some private relief from the United States or other countries. If they seek assistance from the World Bank, they must submit detailed reconstruction plans, explaining the use of the loans; simply requesting emergency relief will not be effective.

Although the World Bank is also an international organization, it is not much different from UNRRA. However, in UNRRA, although the United States' contributions were greater than other countries, its voting power was not much greater than other countries. But in the World Bank, more than 35% of the voting rights are controlled by the United States. The allocation of voting rights is roughly proportional to the funds invested by each country. The total capital of the World Bank reaches 8 billion US dollars, of which the United States accounts for about 35%. At the same time, according to the bank's rules, any country requesting a loan must obtain the approval of the directly related country (for example, a loan in US dollars must be approved by the United States). Currently, almost all loan requests are based on US dollars as the standard. Therefore, when the World Bank makes decisions on loan issues, it will inevitably be linked to the United States' international policy. In addition, countries hoping to borrow have been slow to submit detailed applications because they know that it is futile to apply before the World Bank's lending capacity is established.

The World Bank's first batch of loans will likely go to France because France has long stated its intention to borrow 500 million US dollars for reconstruction work, and all aspects of the loan's use and repayment methods are ready. The Netherlands' request for a loan to cover the deficit in international trade is also unlikely to encounter any difficulties.

Poland's request for a loan of 600 million US dollars may not be easy to achieve immediately. It is recalled that in June this year, the United States government withheld a 40 million US dollar credit loan to Poland through the Export-Import Bank, requiring Poland to publish the commercial agreements it had signed with neighboring countries before proceeding with the loan.

Czechoslovakia may request a loan of 300 million US dollars, but its prospects are not necessarily smooth. In addition, Denmark will likely request 50 million US dollars, and Chile will likely request 40 million US dollars. Whether these will become reality remains to be seen.

It is currently difficult to predict the World Bank's outlook in its initial years of operation. According to experts inside and outside the bank, the World Bank's lending capacity in 1947 will be approximately 1.5 billion US dollars, reaching a peak of 8 billion US dollars by 1950. (See diagram)

As the World Bank's lending amount increases, new member countries may join, ensuring more funds to back the loans. As for now, although the World Bank has opened, it is still far from realizing the lofty goals set by the Bretton Woods financial conference. All countries participating in the World Bank feel that separating international economics from international politics is an extremely difficult matter, as it has been in the past and remains so today.

[United Press, Washington, 27th] World Bank Vice President Smith announced today that Colombia has become the 39th country to join the bank, with a subscription amount of 35 million US dollars. Since the establishment of the World Bank's twin organization, the International Monetary Fund, Colombia has been a member of the fund. However, the country's participation in the World Bank has been delayed until now due to domestic legal and technical reasons. There are five other countries that participated in the Bretton Woods Conference held in the summer of 1944 that can join the World Bank before the 31st of this month, but have not yet expressed their intention to join. These five countries are New Zealand, Australia, Venezuela, Liberia, and the Soviet Union.

### Ministry of Communications Sends Personnel to Comfort the Injured and Mourn the Dead, Deeply Feels the Urgency of Improving Aviation Facilities, Convened a Meeting of Two Company Personnel Yesterday to Review, Losses Estimated at 2.5 Billion Yuan

[This Newspaper] After the tragic incident in this city, where three passenger planes crashed in one night, resulting in more than 80 deaths and injuries, the Nanjing Ministry of Communications attached great importance to it. It specially sent Li Bohou, Director of the Aviation Administration Department, and Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to Shanghai to offer condolences and supervise the handling of the aftermath. Li and Dai arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday and went to Longhua Airport around 9:00 AM to convene a meeting with senior officials from the Central Air Transport Corporation and the China National Aviation Corporation to listen to the companies' reports on the accident and casualties and to review the causes and responsibilities for the accident. The meeting ended at 12:00 PM.

In the afternoon, Li and others went to the crash sites for on-site inspection. At around 4:00 PM, accompanied by personnel from the China National Aviation Corporation, they went to the Zhongshan Voice Academy to comfort the injured and pay respects to the deceased at the funeral homes.

### Visiting Zhongshan Hospital

The injured being treated at Zhongshan Hospital include six passengers from aircraft 140: Min Wanzhen, Zhang Qiyun, Liu Shengxiang, Chen A'er, Zhao Jixing, and Yu Lu Yin Huan; six passengers from aircraft 115: Zhang Chunhua, Wu Rongbing, Xue Jin Fan, Xu Weilong, girl Xu Liangyi, pilot Poulos; and a lively and healthy boy named Wang Didi.

### Poulos Snores Loudly, Black-Clad Woman Smiles

Led by staff from Zhongshan Hospital, Li and Dai went to various wards to offer condolences. The first person they saw was pilot Poulos, who was snoring loudly in bed. Except for his mouth and nose, his entire body was wrapped in bandages, and his feet were propped up with something. Zhang Chunhua, in another ward, had lighter injuries. A black-clad woman was diligently attending to her by the bedside, and both of them had smiles on their faces. The happiness they felt for being fortunate enough to survive was something that others could not imagine. It is no wonder that Director Li repeatedly said, "Blessed! Blessed!" Another injured person in the same room, Zhao Jixing, was being fed by a nurse. His father, a National Assembly representative from Liaoning Province, reportedly arrived at the hospital yesterday morning to visit him.

### Chen A'er Talks Nonsense, Liu Shengxiang Had a Nightmare

Chen A'er, in another ward, was still not fully conscious and was talking nonsense. Liu Shengxiang was able to recount the events before the accident, saying, "I felt dizzy at the time, and another female passenger on the plane gave me medicine to take. Suddenly, I felt the plane shake, and then I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I looked around the cabin and saw seven other people, five of whom were already dead." Another lightly injured person, Xue Jinfan, was being X-rayed at this time. Several other injured people were asleep. Director Li and Director Dai each left a card on everyone's bed to express their condolences. The most seriously injured was female passenger Yu Lu Cheng Huan. From the nurse's expression, it could be seen that her life was still in danger.

### Innocent Wang Didi, Does Not Understand Sorrow

Wang Didi, who was unharmed, was sitting in bed, being fed porridge by a nurse. He was wearing a red floral cotton robe and had a chubby face. He was very cute, staring at people with his big eyes. The nurses and family members of other patients in the room were all gathered around him, teasing him. Everyone said that he was a child who "must have good fortune in the future." His safety and well-being not only surprised many people but also won the love of countless others.

### Returning to Nanjing Today to Report

After leaving Zhongshan Hospital, they continued to go to various funeral homes to pay respects to the deceased and comfort the families. Finally, Director Li made a statement to reporters, saying: The bad weather was the main reason for the accident involving the three aircraft of the Central Air Transport Corporation and the China National Aviation Corporation, but the inadequacy of civil aviation facilities cannot be denied. Civil aviation in our country is still in the development stage, and it must not give people the feeling that air transport is like a long journey. After offering condolences to the injured and paying respects to the deceased today, I feel extremely saddened. Therefore, I feel even more that the improvement of civil aviation facilities is a matter of utmost urgency. Upon returning to Nanjing this time, I will report the situation to the authorities and try to improve it effectively. Considerable progress will be made by next year at the latest. Director Li and Director Dai are scheduled to return to Nanjing today to report and will bring with them pictorial reports from the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation.

According to statistics, the losses due to the accident amounted to more than 2.5 billion yuan for the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation.

### Pilot's Wife, Misses Him by a Narrow Margin, May Arrive on the Ship Ye Hua Ming

[This Newspaper] It is reported that the wife of Greenwood, the pilot of China National Aviation Corporation aircraft 140 who died in the accident, will arrive in Shanghai at 2:00 PM tomorrow. She departed from Houston, Texas, USA, on the Larks ship on November 15, intending to meet her husband, but unexpectedly, disaster struck. Missing him by a narrow margin, Mrs. Greenwood traveled thousands of miles across the ocean, only to encounter such a tragic end. This is truly unfortunate.

### Central Air Transport Corporation Issues Important Statement: Rumors of Another Missing Aircraft Are Absolutely Untrue

[This Newspaper] On Christmas night, in the heavy rain and fog, the Central Air Transport Corporation and China National Aviation Corporation flights from Chongqing to Shanghai crashed in the suburbs of this city. It has been confirmed that only three aircraft were involved. The rumor that Central Air Transport Corporation aircraft XTT 38 was also missing is not true. When reporters went to Longhua Airport yesterday, they saw aircraft 38 safely parked at the airport. Moreover, according to a statement from the person in charge of the Central Air Transport Corporation, if another aircraft were indeed missing, the company would not need to conceal it and could not conceal it. In fact, aircraft 38 has not made any flights recently, so the outside world's reports are all misunderstandings. The company has now asked the Central News Agency to send a telegram nationwide to announce the truth.

### More Seriously Injured Passengers Die, Compensation is 1 Million Per Person, Funeral and Medical Expenses Are Borne by the Company

[This Newspaper] Among the pilots and passengers of the three crashed aircraft, all eleven people on Central Air Transport Corporation aircraft 48 died. Of the fifteen people rescued from China National Aviation Corporation aircraft 140 and 115 and sent to Zhongshan Hospital, Yu Peng and an unknown child died of their injuries the night before. Yesterday, one more flight radio operator, Wang Xiaode, also passed away. Therefore, as of last night, the total number of deaths from the three passenger planes has increased to 69, including 11 from Central Air Transport Corporation aircraft 48, 34 from China National Aviation Corporation aircraft 115, and 24 from aircraft 140. There are still 12 injured people in Zhongshan Hospital, but among them, female passenger Yu Lu Yin Huan remains in a coma and her life is in danger. As for the unharmed four-year-old child, Wang Didi, no one has come to claim him yet.

In Zhangjiazhai, Jiangwan, in the destroyed civilian houses, other than one death, three injured people were treated at Gongji Hospital and are no longer in serious condition. Zhang Guoye, the head of the household, received the bad news in Nanjing and returned to Shanghai yesterday to handle the funeral arrangements.

Some of the bodies of the passengers who died in the crash, which were placed in the China, Universal, and Central Funeral Homes, were claimed by their families yesterday, and some have been embalmed. According to the persons in charge of the Central Air Transport Corporation and the China National Aviation Corporation, the funeral expenses of the deceased will naturally be borne by the company. If the family members claim the body and wish to handle the funeral themselves, the company is also willing to pay the same amount as the burial fee for those whose bodies are temporarily unclaimed. According to estimates from the funeral homes, this funeral expense is approximately 3.6 million yuan per body. In addition, according to government regulations, the company will also pay for the medical expenses of the injured and a compensation of 1 million yuan for each deceased, as well as 200,000 yuan for luggage compensation. However, the compensation and other amounts may be increased to show the company's apologies. The exact amount is still under negotiation and will be decided after consulting with the Ministry of Communications. The damaged civilian houses will also be compensated. The deceased pilots and radio operators will each receive a compensation of 5,000 to 10,000 US dollars.

### Weather Turns Clear, Flights Resume as Usual

### Amendment to Tax Law Affects Revenue, Finance Bureau to Formulate Supplementary Measures, Feast Tax, Levied in Different Grades, Approved at Yesterday's Municipal Meeting

[Our Report] Since the Central Legislative Yuan passed the reduction of feast tax and entertainment tax in various places, this city has consistently followed it. However, the Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the city's construction expenses require a large amount of funds, and the tax revenue is significantly insufficient. Although the new tax law has some difficulties in implementation, it is determined to try its best to comply. However, the feast tax has always been a major source of tax revenue in this city, and it is difficult to implement unless some changes are made. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has formulated supplementary measures on the premise of not violating the spirit of the original bill:

The collection of feast tax will still use the original 3,000 yuan as the starting point for taxation. Regardless of Chinese or Western cuisine, all feasts exceeding 3,000 yuan will be taxed. As for the new tax law, the tax rate is 10% for those exceeding the starting point by less than five times, and 20% for those exceeding the starting point by five times or more. However, the Finance Bureau believes that the price of each item is difficult to verify, so it is recommended to change it to divide restaurants into three grades (A, B, and C) based on their business equipment and whether they handle full table cuisine. Grade A restaurants will be taxed at 20%, Grade B restaurants will be taxed at 10%, and restaurants with music and dancing will be taxed at 25% as entertainment tax. Restaurants and dim sum shops that specialize in selling food for the common people will still be tax-exempt. The above method of grading and taxing the feast tax has been approved at the municipal meeting yesterday morning, but it will not be implemented until it is approved by the City Council.

### Police Bureau Explains the Significance of Household Administration

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding recent reports in the newspapers stating that the city's household administration will be managed by the Civil Affairs Bureau next year, the Municipal Police Bureau indicated that there were some discrepancies. Yesterday, they issued a statement clarifying that the household survey conducted by the police bureau and the household administration work of the Civil Affairs Bureau are fundamentally different in nature. The police bureau's handling of household registration aims to understand the movements of the city's residents to maintain public order, focusing on "qualitative" management. On the other hand, the Civil Affairs Bureau's handling of household administration aims to determine the domicile and identity of the people, providing a basis for allocating rights and obligations, focusing on "quantitative" statistics. Their purposes and applications are distinctly different. Special investigations by the police on places with complex personnel situations and uneven quality are aimed at preventing the occurrence of harm, which is completely different from the household administration conducted by the Civil Affairs Bureau. Furthermore, the medical bureau's criminal records and population cards are specifically used to register wanted warrants and judgments from various military, administrative, and judicial agencies to investigate crimes, arrest wanted criminals, and implement control measures according to the Precautionary Law, all of which have practical effects. Yesterday, the bureau also received a telegram from the Ministry of Interior, forwarded by the Municipal Government, instructing that the original household survey institutions of the police bureau should be retained to handle investigations related to public security. Therefore, the bureau's household registration work will continue to follow the central government's orders, diligently and legally handle matters, without any changes.

### Investigation of Embezzlement in the Reception of Automobiles: Studying the Invoices

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the case of embezzlement in the city government's reception of automobiles, the District Prosecutor's Office requested the Municipal Government to identify the 16 "repair fees" suspected of being involved, and the Municipal Government invited the Enemy Property Management Bureau and other agencies to cooperate with experts to handle the matter. However, because of the long interval, it is impossible to determine whether each vehicle was repaired at that time, and it is even more difficult to estimate whether the fees were appropriate. Those involved in the repair believe that there is obviously another reason, and the investigation team also paid attention to this point in the files handed over. However, all the evidence is not sufficient to determine the guilt of each defendant, and they cannot be prosecuted for the time being. The handling prosecutor is currently studying the invoices from the repair shops, hoping to find the truth from this clue.

### Concrete Agreement Reached on Stabilizing Cotton Yarn Measures; Implementation Date Awaiting Approval; Separate Discussion on Cotton Yarn Purchase Cost

[Report from Our Newspaper] The six points on stabilizing yarn prices, since Wang Qiyu of the Six District Cotton Spinning Association visited President Song a few days ago for further consultations, have already reached a concrete agreement. Yesterday, the six points were finally successfully passed at the general meeting of the Six District Cotton Spinning Association held at 2:00 PM. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Spinning Management Committee held an expanded meeting. Wu (concurrently chairman), Li (vice chairman), and committee members Shu Zizhang, Wang Qiyu, Wang Yangxian, Wu Weijing, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Rong Yixin, and Liu Wenteng, director of the committee's business department, submitted the six points for discussion. With slight annotations, they were passed. However, the issue of the implementation date of the new plan is still awaiting President Song's approval. In addition, regarding the government's purchase of cotton spinning prices, it was decided that national and private yarn factories would each nominate three representatives to agree on the accounting items for calculating costs at the Jiangxi Road Spinning Construction Company at 10:00 AM today, and then calculate their costs separately. The Spinning Construction Company has already nominated Cai Huimin and other three representatives, while private factories have nominated representatives from Yongan, Shenxin, and Qingfeng factories. In addition, the fourth batch of the fourth phase of replicated industry-allocated yarn will be distributed after the new negotiated price is approved. The six points of the "Measures to Stabilize Yarn Prices" passed by the Spinning Management Committee are recorded as follows:

Measures to Stabilize Cotton Yarn Prices

(1) For yarn factories that have purchased or intend to purchase foreign cotton, the government will purchase half of the cotton yarn produced from January 1, 1947. If the cotton yarn is used to weave cloth, the government may purchase the cotton cloth. Note: This will be implemented temporarily in yarn factories in the Shanghai urban area.

(2) The purchase price will be the cost plus a 20% profit. The purchase price will be determined by a review meeting organized by one representative appointed by the Spinning Management Committee and one representative each from the Spinning Construction Company and private yarn factories.

(3) The remaining yarn and cloth, except for those purchased, will be concentrated by each factory in the market for open trading. The buyer's name, amount, and purpose of the above transactions must be compiled into a detailed table and submitted to the competent authority for review on a daily basis. Note: In addition to opening yarn in its own factory, each factory shall report the quantity of yarn opened on that day to the designated market manager (the designated location is temporarily in the Yarn Industry Association).

(4) The government will use all the purchased yarn and cloth to balance yarn and cloth prices. If the allocation price is higher than the purchase price, the surplus will be stored by the government in a special account for the purpose of subsidizing cotton production and developing the textile industry.

(5) Hereafter, for any yarn factory that purchases cotton with foreign exchange supplied by the government, 50% of the yarn and cloth produced will be purchased by the government. The purchase price will be the cost plus a 20% profit. Yarn and cloth made from domestically produced cotton may be bought and sold by themselves according to Article 3.

(6) These measures will be terminated when yarn and cloth market prices are relatively stable.

### Frequent Market Fluctuations; Gold, Stocks, and Currency Unpredictable; Gold and Currency Surge Again; Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall

Strong Gold and Currency Absorption: The scarlet fever (referring to intense speculation) continued to rise gradually yesterday amid actual sales and short covering. The morning opened at 3.35 million, and after opening, it rose from 3.33 million to 3.42 million due to reports that financial panic was being maintained. There was some pressure at higher levels and it fell back to 3.34 million. However, people's minds were settled, and the situation was stable. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 134 bars at a price of 3.38 million. After that, under the agitation of retail buyers, it repeatedly pulled up. The supply was sluggish, and the high price approached 3.5 million. There was still a small amount of pressure at higher levels. At noon, it was around 3.45 million. In the afternoon, it rebounded again. The next-day delivery opened and jumped to over 3.5 million. The Central Bank supplied at higher levels, and floating longs sold, and the market retreated to 3.28 million near the close. As a result, it fell another 20,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were listed at 35,000, and silver ingots and silver dollars were flat. The underground overnight interest rate was slightly loose, with interest rates ranging from 1.6 to 1.8 fen.

Foreign Currencies Gradually Stabilizing: The initial black market price of US dollars started at a buying price of 6,250 yuan. At noon, the price rose to about 6,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the high price reached 6,700 yuan, but later, due to the sharp decline in gold prices, it fell back to 6,300 yuan at the close, resulting in a slight increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars fell by 30 yuan due to the urgent need for cash from Cantonese merchants. The Hong Kong exchange rate once fell to 1,210 yuan. As gold and currency rebounded, there was still a supply at 1,250 yuan at noon. Indian exchange was 1,525 yuan, and British exchange was 20,000 yuan, all selling prices, with few transactions.

Government Bonds Slightly Stable Yesterday: Miscellaneous Class A and B bonds were absorbed by 604 offices and were relatively firm. Unified Class C opened at 1,580 yuan in the morning, and started at 1,600 yuan. It was sold by two major players on the fifth floor and fell back to 1,430 yuan.

As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A and B rose by 120 yuan, Class C rose by 30 yuan, Class D rose by 50 yuan, and Class E rose by 70 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan.

Stock Market Absorption Not Weak: The Chinese stock market saw good news yesterday, but people in the industry were forced to end contra-trading within the year due to the end of the year, and there was no talk of rolling it over. There were too many retail longs, so there were many obstacles to rising. The market closed at a low price. The morning opened slightly higher due to reports boosting buying. After opening, it was weakened by the supply outside the market. 207, 199, 14, 99, and 229 were sold, gradually declining. After 10 o'clock, due to the very stable gold market, it rose slightly under the addition of 89. Later, as gold prices rose, 178 and others also purchased and rose to above 640 yuan. Rong then sold to the limit through 151, with slight struggles. 83, 145, 89, 233, 154, 151, and 198 were continuously purchased. The forward Yongsheng rose to 654 yuan after 11:15. 207, 171, 215, and 178 were sold. Near noon, the gold market also fell back, and retail longs scrambled to sell. The noon close saw weakness. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng and Qinxing fell slightly, Meiya, Xinyi, Jingfu, and Xinguang rose slightly, and Huafeng was flat. Cold stocks, Jingfu, stopped rising, matches rose by half, Qing'an fell by nearly 20%, and the rest rose slightly. Forward delivery, Yongsheng and Xinyi rose slightly, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng were flat, and Meiya rose by half. In the afternoon, because gold prices were high, the market opened high. 152, 232, 212, 229, and 215 all entered. Current Yongsheng rose to 645 yuan. 185 was sold and once fell back by more than 10 yuan. However, the gold market was even more attractive. 229, 198, and 145 entered again, and a high price of 648 yuan was seen. 185, 224, 4, 14, and 16 continuously supplied. The gold price suddenly plummeted and finally broke below 600 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng and Xinguang each fell by about half, Meiya, Huafeng, and Xinyi fell slightly, and Qinxing and Jingfu rose slightly. Cold stocks, matches, rose by 10%, Zhongfang Datong rose slightly, Jingxing and Huafeng were flat, and the honor and disgrace of each stock outside the market was subtle.

### Suspension of Exchange Shops; Central Bank Strictly Supervises

If they apply for resumption of business after liquidation is completed, they will be seriously considered to avoid the recurrence of unfortunate events.

### Italian Rayon Arrives in Shanghai for Sale; Price Slightly Higher than the Allotted Price

It is reported that Italian rayon has recently arrived in considerable quantities. Last week, a certain merchant in the city intended to sell 300 boxes of Italian rayon to the China Trust Bureau, but the China Trust Bureau only agreed to purchase it if the selling price was lower than the allotted price, so the transaction did not go through. It is heard that before the war, the annual import of Italian rayon into China was about 20,000 boxes, while Japanese rayon was between 60,000 and 80,000 boxes. Before the war, the average monthly demand for rayon in China was about 9,000 boxes, but most manufacturers at that time used Japanese rayon because each box had extra pounds. The specified number of pounds per box of rayon is 200 pounds, but Japanese rayon at that time wanted to occupy the Chinese market, so the number of pounds per box was between 205 and 206 pounds. However, there is no such preference in the current barter period. It is also heard that the China Trust Bureau has approved quota applications for rayon for various industries this month, and there are still more than 100 boxes that have not been allocated. It is now decided to hold a final allocation next Monday (30th). If no application is made after the deadline, it will be considered a waiver. As for the miscellaneous brands of rayon sold in the market recently, it is heard that most of them are Italian goods, and their prices are about 400,000 yuan higher than the allotted price.

### Caustic Soda Plummets

In the raw material market yesterday, due to the tightening of credit, raw material prices generally fell. Sodium nitrate (Chilean nitrate) fell from 28 million yuan per ton to 16 million yuan. Glycerin and sweet potato prices remained at the original level. Caustic soda fell the most sharply. Yesterday, the market price was 2.9 million yuan per barrel, and a small amount was traded at 2.2 million yuan. Although the price has fallen by 1 million yuan, because user factories are also tight on credit, no one is buying it. Today's market is likely to see an astonishing fall. In fact, caustic soda and soda ash among the raw materials are generally considered to be no different from gold. Once they are sold, the position can be converted, so there are still a large number of buyers waiting for positions.

### Tea, Tung Oil, and Huzhou Silk Shipped to Europe in Large Quantities

[Report from Our Newspaper] The British shipping company's Deloraine left Shanghai for Europe yesterday afternoon, carrying a total of more than 1,700 tons of goods, including more than 500 boxes of tea, 44 tons of tung oil, about 100 bales of Huzhou silk, more than 800 pieces of pig bristles, and 814 tons of cottonseed cake shipped to London. These exports were rare even before the war, and this is the first time that such items have been exported to Europe from this city since the victory. In addition, a large amount of cotton yarn and piece goods were shipped to Guangdong. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhongkai ship exported 874 pieces of piece goods and 601 pieces of pharmaceuticals from the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday, as well as 1,149 pieces of cotton yarn from the China Textile Corporation, and more than 5,440 packages of raw peanuts and 51 pieces of raw oil to Guangzhou.

### Cotton Yarn Exchange to Open Next Year

Although the Shanghai Municipal Management Committee and the Municipal Government have strictly banned the black market for cotton yarn, it has not yet disappeared. Furthermore, the black market yarn prices have changed drastically during the recent financial turmoil, with wide fluctuations. The No. 6 District Silk Yarn Industry Association, in order to eliminate speculation by outsiders, intends to restore the organization of the exchange during the period when the authorities allow yarn factories to trade freely. The matter has been submitted to the Spinning Management Committee for approval, and preparations are underway to restore the former cotton yarn exchange market on Zhongzheng East Road. The preparations will be presided over by Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Spinning Management Committee, and are expected to be realized within January next year.

### Yongxing Gold Shop Manipulates Speculation; Authorities Send Personnel to Seal and Investigate

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Social Bureau, Finance Bureau, Police Bureau, and Public Utilities Bureau, etc., recently received reports stating that Yongxing Gold Shop at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road in this city is suspected of manipulating speculation in the gold market, selling short, and operating underground banks. Therefore, at 6:00 PM the other day, they jointly dispatched personnel to the shop and sealed up more than 100 interphone telephones. It is learned that the shop has been open for many years and has been trading quite actively on weekdays, and has invisibly become a concentrated market for gold trading. Therefore, the gold market trading was quite chaotic yesterday after it was sealed the other day. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Chen Ruitang, the person in charge of the shop, who said: This shop has a considerable history of operating gold trading. On weekdays, it accepts the entrustment of various customers and buys and sells for them. There has never been a way to open gold futures with only 30% margin. On weekdays, it occasionally borrows and lends to peers due to the surplus or deficit of its own positions. This is a common business practice in the general financial industry and cannot be compared with the so-called underground bank business. Now the shop has submitted all account books to the Municipal Finance Bureau for investigation. Whether it is right or wrong will have its own final factual proof.

### There are a Total of Seventeen Sichuan Banking and Money Shops in this City

A reporter was recently told by a leading figure in Sichuan banking that, apart from the Juxingcheng Bank, which has a considerable position in Shanghai's financial community and is a leader among Sichuan banks, there are also Sichuan Meifeng, Hecheng, Chongqing Commercial, Chuankang, Chuanfeng, Yaxi, Fuhua, Yongcheng, Dayu, Sichuan Agricultural and Industrial, Tonghui, Yifeng, Chengdu Commercial, Taiyu, and Huitong, a total of fifteen banks, as well as Yongqing, Yifeng, and Yongsheng, a total of three money shops, making a total of nineteen banking and money shops.

### More than 10,000 Import Licenses Approved

A person in charge of the Pipe Committee told reporters today that the soaring prices this time are rumored to be affected by the fact that the import quota figures of the committee have not yet been announced, and that the application procedures for licenses are slow. This rumor is actually one-sided. Since the committee started handling the issuance of import licenses, as of yesterday, more than 1,000 first-class licenses and more than 15,000 second- and third-class licenses have been approved. The issue of import quotas is also being actively studied recently and will be announced soon.

### Banks Strictly Handle Prevention of Issuing Bad Checks; Measures to Ban Customer Returned Checks Re-Revised

The Shanghai Banking Commercial Industry Association recently re-revised the draft of the Provisional Measures for Banning Customer Returned Checks. The revised draft is recorded below: Article 1: In addition to customers well-known to the bank, customers opening check accounts with the bank should have a guarantor recognized by the bank. Article 2: If a customer issues a check exceeding the deposit or overdraft limit and the bank returns the check, the returning bank should issue a written warning and charge a returned check handling fee of 1/1000 of the face value of the check, but not less than 1,000 yuan in national currency each time.

### Rice Market Arrivals Not Many, Market Continues to Weaken

[Our Report] Yesterday, rice arrivals were not plentiful. The south market saw 940 dan, and the north market 2653 dan. Relevant personnel indicated that the reasons for the scarce arrivals were: firstly, rainy weather reduced the activity of vendors; secondly, tight credit in the city led to rice shops being less enthusiastic about stocking up. Close attention is now being paid to the arrival quantity in the next few days. If scarcity persists, necessary measures will be taken. Rice prices are quite stable, with Changshu rice in the north market at 63,000 yuan per dan.

Another report: The rice market yesterday, with the weather turning sunny, saw softened sentiment. Buyers showed no intention to resist, and sellers relaxed. The market was filled with selling pressure. Northern japonica rice continued to fall by 1,000-2,000 yuan, and southern japonica rice further dropped by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice gradually decreased by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Youmi rice saw few transactions. Flour prices were high inland, but with Canadian flour continuing to arrive in Shanghai today, the supply source was unblocked, leading to a stabilizing situation. Wheat bran was sluggish, continuing to weaken by 100-200 yuan. Soybean cake imports from Shantou were still acceptable, but with oil mills continuously supplying, prices rose slightly by 100 yuan. Cowpeas continued to be purchased in Shantou and remained strong. Mung beans were in demand. Red beans were temporarily stable. Corn continued to be absorbed by Qingdao, and the market situation was firm. Red sorghum remained stable. Sesame continued to be widely sold, rising by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw active but not strong sales, with no gains or losses. Broad beans were mediocre. Soybeans saw no strong arrivals or sales, forming a stagnant situation. The oil market was sluggish, with sesame oil falling by 2,000-3,000 yuan, soybean oil down slightly by 1,000-2,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil weak and flat. Barrelled raw oil also declined by 2,000-3,000 yuan, but unrefined oil still saw continued seller support, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Various grains are temporarily trending towards stability and weakness.

### Yarn Market Stops Decline, Rebounds

Yesterday, the yarn market stopped declining and rebounded, as the previous losses had been significant. In addition, rising gold prices prompted those in the industry to tighten sales due to substantial losses on hand. As a result, various yarn counts and threads rose by 30,000-80,000 yuan. Sentiment has thus stabilized somewhat, unlike the listless situation of the past few days.

### Import Merchants Significantly Reduce Orders

Recently, an import firm informed the reporter that after the implementation of import controls this time, orders to foreign countries have been greatly reduced. The failure to settle foreign exchange for most goods is one reason, but the main reason is that most merchants are uninterested in placing orders due to the indefinite arrival of goods. As for the price increase of domestic inventory, it is inevitable. For example, copper, tin, hardware and other supplies are still rising in price recently.

### Dumping of Japanese Goods, Very Likely to Be Shipped to China, South Seas Deserve Special Attention

[Our Report] It is rumored that next year Japanese goods will be dumped on a large scale into China. When the reporter inquired to relevant personnel, it was indicated that, based on the speed of Japan's industrial recovery, this matter is quite possible. However, in the near future, if Japanese goods are openly imported in large quantities, it will definitely be prohibited by our government. Therefore, it is necessary to disguise them as goods from other countries to enter our market. This year, some people have already used Japan's low labor costs and skilled techniques to weave silk in Japan with our country's exported raw silk, selling it to other countries under the name "China Silk," which is actually Japanese goods. With this precedent, in the future, some people may use Japanese labor and raw materials to set up factories in Japan or form partnerships with Japanese people in other ways, importing their finished products into our country in large quantities. This deserves close attention. As for the Japanese side sending personnel to Southeast Asia for business activities, although there is no definite evidence, it is highly possible.

### Extremely Tight Credit, Silk Market Continues to Weaken

Yesterday's silk market conditions continued to weaken due to extremely tight credit. Artificial silk 120 High Mountain brand, with luster, was initially quoted at 3.27 million yuan in the morning, but the selling sentiment in the market was strong, almost retreating to 3.22 million yuan. The Toyo brand had relatively fewer goods and slightly higher prices, sold at 3.35 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000-60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining semi-luster and 150 luster remained at the original price. Transactions between factories and distributors were scarce, and sentiment was weak. Yesterday's quoted prices were all reduced by about 100,000 yuan. Silk fabrics also trended downward. Quilted covers and checkered crepe, although quoted at the original price of the previous day, saw no transactions. Huajin crepe fell another 50 yuan yesterday.

### Jinshan Longan Twigs Rise Again

Jinshan longan twigs saw rising production prices, while exchange rates shrunk. This increased costs, and the Shanghai price was around 280,000 yuan. As a result, the Shanghai market was invigorated. Yesterday, the market price for registered longan twigs rose to 286,000 yuan, an increase of 30,000-40,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market is still wary of further tightening, as the difference compared to dried longan is still significant.

### Exported Goods with Settled Foreign Exchange Must Pay Guarantee Deposits

The Ministry of Finance recently instructed customs authorities that, for exported goods with settled foreign exchange, which are transported by sea or cross the land border for re-import and domestic sale, and must pass through foreign ports or foreign territory, except for vessels engaged in regular trade according to ordinary transportation regulations, if transported by other vehicles, private ships, or steamers, merchants should be required to pay a 30% guarantee deposit for release. This guarantee deposit should be verified by the original Shanghai customs office based on the report form endorsed and returned by the customs office at the designated destination. If there is no customs office at the destination, the deposit will be returned upon verification of documents certified by the local county government, chamber of commerce, or trade association. If the reporting person cannot present the above report form or certification documents, the customs office may transfer the entire guarantee deposit to the national treasury.

### Green Tea Sales to the Philippines Very Brisk

In the foreign tea market, British export firms demanded high-end aged Keemun tea, but transactions failed to materialize due to a lack of sellers. However, the Zhenzhen and Zhenmei green teas destined for Africa have been selling well recently, and the market is quite promising. According to industry sources, a certain tea company is currently interested in aged pearl tea, but the existing stock is even more depleted, resulting in a fruitless search. The transaction volume is extremely bleak, while prices remain firm, with prospects possibly soaring to the sky. As for Hua tea sales to the United States, it is still difficult to expand, as prices do not match each other's tastes. In addition, this year's Japanese tea exports to the United States have reached 7.5 million pounds. Therefore, there is a wait-and-see attitude towards our country's tea. Domestic sales of red and green tea are experiencing a more severe decline, and people's faces are showing increasing anxiety.

### Taiwan Sugar Returns to Softening Trend

Yesterday, the sugar market saw another decline. The current price of middle-grade white sugar in the council's registered price was still flat at the beginning, at 145,000 yuan, then dropped to 137,000-137,500 yuan. Raw red sugar was 130,000 yuan to 128,000 yuan. The degree of decline was nearly 10,000 yuan. Shantou green opened at 124,000 yuan, down slightly by 2,000 yuan. Runde green was 113,000 yuan to 110,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 10,000 yuan compared to the 24th. More than 300 bags were traded. Xinghua white sugar was 163,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar was 158,000 yuan to 155,000 yuan, and the next grade was 152,000 yuan, with about 300 transactions.

### Production Enterprise Loan Technology Investigation Begins

Imports from foreign countries will cease collection from today. If they are domestic goods, the collection will cease from the date of the Goods Tax Bureau's order.

### Xinghua Dried Longan Rises Steadily

Xinghua dried longan, which is a popular route, has been rising steadily in price, and is also soaring in price. Yesterday, the incoming yellow four-year type opened at 480,000 yuan. The top-grade aged four-year type reached 410,000 yuan, an increase of 20-30% compared to the previous year.

### Ramie Prices Rise

Ramie has not arrived for a long time, and recently, with frequent actual sales, prices have been slowly rising. Yellow ramie has increased from 42,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan per dan. Raw ramie has increased from 80,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan per dan. Middle grade ramie has increased from 95,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan per dan. Other ramie scraps are also extremely stable.

### United States Reclaims Davis Cup, Doubles Win Over Australia in Straight Sets, Two Young Americans Put on Peak Performance

[United Press, Yule, 27th] The American Davis Cup team of 克拉茂 (Kramo?) and 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) today defeated the Australian team of 勃朗维区 (Blangweiqu?) and 奎斯脱 (Kuisite?) in straight sets in the doubles match: 6-2, 7-5, 6-4. They reclaimed the Davis Cup, the world tennis championship, lost in 1938. Tomorrow's final two singles matches are irrelevant to the outcome. The Australian team had won the cup from the American team in 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the competition was suspended. Today, the sun was quite strong, and there were approximately 14,000 spectators. 克拉茂 (Kramo?) and 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) put on a peak performance, which was extremely精彩(jingcai) [brilliant, wonderful]. Although the Australian team fought with all their strength, they were ultimately no match for the American team's speed and accuracy. In the first set, the American team immediately won four consecutive games, establishing a resounding momentum and winning with 6-2. In the second set, the Australian team fought hard to tie the score at 5-5. 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) broke 奎斯脱 (Kuisite?)'s serve and then won his own service game, winning the second set with 7-5. 奎斯脱 (Kuisite?) was the weaker member of the Australian team. 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) was a major contributor to the American team's victory. 克拉茂 (Kramo?) performed as usual, but this young Californian 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) was even more outstanding. 许洛特 (Xu Luote?)'s selection was only decided at the last minute, replacing 派克 (Paike?) as the second singles player, and partnering with 克拉茂 (Kramo?) in doubles. His defeat of the ambidextrous general 勃朗维区 (Blangweiqu?) was a surprise. Since the Davis Cup competition began in 1902, this is the American team's tenth victory.

Educational Research

### Teaching Demonstration

— Ma Jingxuan

Teaching demonstration is the most effective activity for guiding teachers' professional development and improving teaching methods. The holding of a teaching demonstration involves the principal, supervisors, or educational research groups inviting a teacher to use a model teaching method to present the teaching process in a very approachable manner, giving the observing teachers a correct impression.

The educational research associations in each district of Shanghai have frequently held teaching demonstrations this semester. This research trend began as early as the pre-victory era, in 1935, when two educators, Chen Heqin and Chen Xuanshan, presided over the Shanghai Special District Education Administration, and they had already earnestly promoted it. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's Supervisory Office and the National Education Department use this as the central work for guiding teachers' professional development, and all teachers in the city are actively participating.

Because teaching demonstrations have a special effect on improving teaching methods, it is indeed necessary to advocate and promote them. Here are the points that should be paid attention to when holding a demonstration, for the reference of institutions or individuals in the education sector who are responsible for guiding teachers' professional development.

(1) Before holding a teaching demonstration, supervisors and teachers undertaking the demonstration should hold a meeting to jointly determine the content and method of the demonstration so that the demonstrator knows the focus of this demonstration so that the observers can easily understand.

(2) Some teaching processes are not suitable for demonstration and may be changed to make them easier to observe.

(3) Before the demonstration teaching, the responsible teacher may first try teaching it once and prepare lesson plans to gain familiarity.

(4) During the demonstration, supervisors should attend with the observing teachers.

(5) During the observation, a teacher should be publicly selected to take shorthand notes, recording the teaching process as a basis for after-the-fact discussion.

(6) After the demonstration teaching is completed, a discussion should be held immediately.

(7) At the beginning of the discussion, the teacher responsible for the demonstration should report on the usual teaching routines, teaching techniques, and the flexible use of this teaching process.

(8) If the observers have any questions, they should raise them immediately and ask the teacher responsible for the demonstration to answer them.

(9) Observers should raise questions about the advantages and disadvantages of what they have observed and discuss them together. The original teaching demonstration is not necessarily a model teaching, so feel free to criticize it.

(10) The teacher responsible for the demonstration should be changed frequently, and should not be undertaken by only a few people.

Teaching demonstration is a good system for supervisors to guide teachers to improve teaching, and it is easiest to obtain teachers' sympathy and understanding. It is worth introducing and promoting, and educational research groups and schools across the country may want to try it.

### National Identity Cards May Not Be Confiscated Arbitrarily; Municipal Government Issues Separate Orders for Public Notice

The Municipal Government has recently received reports that a small number of unscrupulous personnel, taking advantage of their positions, are inspecting people's identity cards without cause, and some have even arbitrarily confiscated, detained, tampered with, or torn them up, which is intentionally disturbing the people. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the Municipal Police Bureau and the district offices to correct and stop this, and a letter was sent to the Songhu Garrison Command ordering them to pay attention to supervision and enforcement. A public notice was also issued, the original text of which is recorded below:

It is hereby announced that the national identity card is a document proving the identity of the holder. According to Article 6 of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Measures for Issuing National Identity Cards: "When people exercise their rights or bear obligations, the competent authority may order the presentation of the national identity card, but it shall not be detained or confiscated." Article 3 of the National Identity Card Precautions issued by the central government stipulates that "Governments at all levels, judicial and security agencies, and the head of the district baojia may, when necessary, order the holder to hand over the identity card for inspection, but shall not detain or confiscate it." Therefore, military and police agencies at all levels shall not conduct inspections without cause, except when necessary for official duties, and shall not arbitrarily detain, confiscate, or even tear them up. However, according to recent reports, a small number of unscrupulous personnel have been taking advantage of their positions to inspect people's identity cards without cause, and some have even arbitrarily confiscated, detained, tampered with, or torn them up. This not only violates laws and regulations but is also intentionally disturbing the people. We hereby reiterate the previous order, earnestly correcting and stopping this. If the above-mentioned situation occurs again in the future, the people may report it at any time, and this government will immediately punish them severely. In addition to separate letters, this notice is hereby issued for public notice.

### Agricultural and Forestry Enterprises in Hainan Island: An Interview with Forestry Expert Mr. Chen Yangcai

— Report from Nanjing, 8th [of the month] by Bo Ying

Professor Chen Zhi (style name Yangcai) is one of our country's few forestry experts. In recent years, he has transitioned from being a scholar to being involved in politics, serving as a technical officer in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. After the Japanese surrendered last year, he was ordered to go to Hainan Island to handle the takeover. Recently, he returned from Qiongyai [Hainan Island] and gave an academic lecture at Jinling University in Nanjing on November 26th, entitled "Agricultural and Forestry Enterprises in Hainan Island." The content was rich and extensive, and the analysis was clear and detailed. After respectfully listening to the lecture, I visited Mr. Chen's residence on the 3rd of this month to ask for his advice. Mr. Chen was patient and meticulous in his instructions. I believe that what he said is deeply significant and relevant to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so I have specifically recorded and published it to promote the attention of the people of our country.

Virgin Land of Resources

Hainan Island is a large island off the southern coast of our country. Together with Taiwan, it is known as the two eyes of China. After the victory, Taiwan and Hainan Island were successively recovered. However, because Taiwan has been developed by the Japanese for 50 years and has its scale, the authorities have specially set up an independent administrative system to operate it. Newspapers and magazines compete to report on the situation and news of Taiwan, which has aroused widespread and enthusiastic attention from the people of the country, which is a gratifying phenomenon. The authorities have not paid much attention to the Hainan Island issue, and newspapers and magazines have rarely recorded and reported it. No wonder Mr. Chen said painfully that we cannot let China be blindly ignorant and indifferent.

Hainan Island, also known as Qiongyai, is located between 18 and 20 degrees north latitude and 108 and 110 degrees east longitude. The soil is fertile, and the climate is warm like the tropics, making it a virgin land for agricultural resources. Before the war, our country was unable to reach it, letting it lie barren. However, the Japanese had coveted it for more than a day. Therefore, after invading on February 10, 1939, they made planned arrangements, preparing to occupy it for a long time and develop it, making it the second Taiwan. A Hainan Island Agricultural Policy Committee was specially established to manage all agricultural and forestry enterprises on the island, including all agricultural improvements, agricultural product processing, and the allocation of various agricultural and forestry companies. A total of 28 units of powerful agricultural and forestry companies from within the country, Taiwan, and the South Seas were ordered to come and set up operations, including agricultural companies, forestry companies, industrial companies, fishery companies, food processing enterprises, and water conservancy enterprises. The total investment of each project was 137 million yuan. The total investment of the Japanese in Hainan Island was 600 million yuan, accounting for just under 23% of their total investment. And the expenses handled by a part of the Navy were not included. Each agricultural and forestry company proceeded in sequence according to the plan. Although there were differences in the order of establishment and the scale, each had its own goals and worked hard. Losses over the years were not taken into account, as they were said to be national policy companies, which were incomparable to private enterprises that only aim to make profits.

Qiongyai agriculture is dominated by crops, which can be divided into three categories: food crops, special-purpose crops, and horticultural crops.

Content of Crops

Regarding food crops, the island's agriculture is almost entirely dominated by this type of crop, with rice in the northeast and sweet potatoes in the southwest being the most important. This is due to the northeast being humid and the southwest being dry. Moreover, because it is located in the tropics, rice can be harvested three times a year, and sweet potatoes can be harvested four times a year, which can be said to be blessed by nature. However, because the land has not been fully utilized and people have not exerted their full efforts, food is still insufficient, and there is still reliance on the import of foreign rice, which is regrettable. The Japanese once tried planting Taiwan's Ponlai rice in Qiongyai and achieved good results. With further efforts, the solution to the food problem on the island is not difficult. Unfortunately, after the agricultural companies were taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Military Affairs, they were not well managed, and the Ponlai rice seeds were lost, and a good foundation was destroyed overnight, which is painful to speak of. Regarding sweet potatoes, the Japanese spared no effort in introducing new varieties for cultivation and preventing and controlling diseases and pests. It is estimated that in five years, the planting area can be increased to 50,000 hectares. If the unit yield is increased by 300 kilograms per hectare per year due to the popularity of improved varieties and the improvement of cultivation, then the total production of sweet potatoes on the island can reach a huge 37.5 million kilograms per year, which can not only supplement the island's food shortage but also greatly benefit the production of liquid fuel. In the past seven years, the Japanese have also tirelessly selected improved varieties of beans, wheat, cassava, etc., and promoted them widely, with remarkable results.

Special-purpose crops include sugarcane for sugar production, peanuts and sesame for oil production, cotton, jute, ramie for fiber, and tobacco. Sugarcane and the sugar production industry related to it are the most promising agricultural operations on the island. Some even believe that its value exceeds that of Taiwan. Because of the relationship between sunshine and temperature, the ripening period of sugarcane in the southwest can be shortened by half a year compared to the year and a half required in Taiwan, and the sugar content is also richer than that produced in Taiwan. Therefore, the Japanese are also particularly diligent in their operation. Although their achievements are not yet sufficient to demonstrate its characteristics, it will not be difficult to obtain excellent results if we wait a few more years. Peanuts and sesame are also important agricultural products of Hainan Island. In addition to meeting the needs of the island, their seeds, fruits, and oil are transported to Hong Kong and Guangdong. The production locations are almost all over the island, and the yield is very high. The Japanese also have new-style oil mills, which further help the promotion of oil crops. Because Qiongyai is on the same isotherm and rainfall line as the world's cotton-producing areas (southern North America, northern India, and Egypt, etc.), it is also a suitable planting area for cotton. Only because the island's climate is mild throughout the year, providing convenience for the life of diseases and insects, the Japanese tried to plant excellent varieties of Egyptian cotton and American cotton systems. As a result, although the diseases were not very severe, the insect pests were rampant, and there were rarely excellent results. However, these are all difficulties that can be overcome by human effort. With effort, it should not be difficult to eradicate them. Although there is not much jute and ramie planted, if we engage in reclamation, expand the planting area, improve the varieties, and select suitable land, the future is also very promising. The cultivation of tobacco on the island has a long history, and excellent yellow varieties have long been imported. However, due to crude planting, there are no sufficient achievements. The various Japanese development companies also failed to select a suitable planting site, and security was not successful. Therefore, they ultimately did not achieve concrete results. However, experts all agree that it is a promising undertaking.

Foundation of Agriculture

The island's four seasons are warm, which is very suitable for the cultivation of tropical fruit trees. The northern part of the island has a period of only a little over a month when it is colder in winter, so it is also quite suitable for the development of subtropical and temperate fruit trees. The Yongxing City, which supplies Haikou with fruit all year round (located in northern Qiongyai, while Yaxian is the only major fruit-producing area in the south), is truly a rare fruit tree holy land in East Asia. Almost all kinds of tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruits are not produced on the island. Therefore, operating a fruit tree garden is the most profitable undertaking on the island. If we can seize the opportunity, it will not be difficult to become rich. The main fruit trees on the island include tangerines, bananas, waxberries, plums, peaches, grapes, plums, pomegranates, loquats, satsumas, star fruit, olives, lychees, longans, jackfruit, bananas, pineapples, sand pears, mangoes, etc., and there are no less than dozens of types. There are many flowers and the yield is abundant. The Japanese have also laid a good foundation for improving the varieties, introducing new varieties for trial planting, and preventing and controlling diseases and pests. With further research, the future is unlimited.

As for the forests of Hainan Island, there are still many primitive forests in the central mountains that have not been developed by the Japanese. In the future, if the political situation is stable and transportation is smooth, the island's forestry and timber industry will have a very bright future without a doubt.

Agricultural water conservancy is the foundation of agriculture. The Japanese recognized its importance and specially established a water conservancy department to actively engage in the investigation, design, and construction of water conservancy projects. The completed projects total 47, benefiting an area of 7,171 hectares. There are 16 uncompleted projects and 23 projects that have been planned but not yet started. All are expected to be completed in the next ten years. If successful, not only will the extremely serious food problem on the island be solved, but the increase in production of various crops will also be solved accordingly.

Agricultural product processing is the industrial processing of several products to make them suitable for utilization and increase their value. This includes rice milling, flour making, sugar making, oil extraction, brewing, and canning. Among the agricultural companies operated by the Japanese, processing enterprises advanced in parallel with crop cultivation. Otherwise, if agriculture only aims to supply raw materials, it is the primitive state of agriculture in ancient times. It is obvious that it does not conform to the trends of the times. But it is painful to say that the general public in our country is ignorant and does not realize that agricultural product processing or food processing belongs to the scope of industry and should be separated and differentiated from the entire agriculture. This led to the disintegration and irreparable damage to all the Hainan Island agricultural companies during this takeover, which is a great misfortune for the country.

After the victory in August last year, various departments of the central government sent personnel to Qiongyai to take over in sequence. Due to the poor distribution of the surrender and takeover agencies, the steps were disorganized and at a loss, compared to the Japanese, who, despite being defeated, handled the handover with clear items and in an orderly manner, so shame on us!

Precious Spoils of Victory

Qiongyai is a tropical agricultural resource land. Therefore, all development should start with agriculture and then gradually progress from agriculture to industry. This is the path that should be taken to develop industry. Therefore, the original agricultural companies operated by the Japanese are valuable spoils of victory on the island. If they can be used well, the industrial development of Hainan Island in 20 years will not be difficult to compete with today's Taiwan. Because Taiwan was as poor as Hainan Island is today when it was under our country's rule. However, after 50 years of operation by the Japanese, it has jumped to become the lifeline of Japan, thanks to the Japanese's vigorous efforts. What is regrettable is that the good foundation laid by the Japanese in Qiongyai was destroyed this time due to poor management, which is regrettable. The current plan is to clean up the mess and carry out rectification, dividing the nature to determine whether it is state-owned or private-owned. All of this will be effective in a good political environment. Therefore, the saying that the province will be established this spring was very reliable (it was once rumored that Zeng Yangfu would be appointed as the head of Qiongyai's administration). At that time, all people who cared about Hainan Island were happily looking forward to it, entrusting it with a ray of hope, hoping that the improvement of the political environment would enable the development of Hainan Island to get on track. Otherwise, as the situation is today, not only is the Guangdong Provincial Government unable to reach and powerless to intervene, but the various institutions on the island are also governing themselves, chaotic and disorganized, and security is not guaranteed, which makes people who are interested in going to Qiongyai to work hesitant, let alone development and construction.

This article is based on Mr. Chen's lecture on the 26th and his conversation with reporters on the 3rd. After the manuscript was completed, it was hurriedly mailed, and I am deeply sorry that Mr. Chen did not revise it again. If there are any errors, the reporter will bear the responsibility for the literature. Mr. Chen is truly a person with a heart. At the beginning of the victory, the authorities intended to invite Mr. Chen to take charge of forestry in Taiwan. However, Mr. Chen, with his scholar's true color and keen insight, avoided the easy and took on the difficult, rushing to Hainan Island, which most people had never visited, and shouldering heavy responsibilities. In the past year, although he was unable to display his talents due to the harsh objective environment, he was extremely discouraged. However, Mr. Chen has continued to write many systematic texts based on his observations. Most of them have been published in the East, and recently, I heard that he has written a book of hundreds of thousands of words, "Hainan Island Development Plan," the manuscript has been completed, and it will be published soon, showing that its early publication is a special highlight for the publishing industry. Mr. Chen will be the first person in our country to research Hainan Island and write systematically. This contribution is very precious. (December 8, 1946, in Nanjing)

### Year-End Dark Clouds Press Down on Guilin

— Guilin 21st Air Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Guilin, Liang Xiaozhong

Another year easily passes; spring is gone, autumn is gone, and more than three hundred days have been lightly sent into the depths of memory. Some families rejoice, some suffer in confusion; it all looks like a cloud, a wisp of smoke! Those who see the world with coldness are often those who are treated coldly by the world. The quiet Guangxi, few people think about how to spend New Year's Day. In their eyes, they still need to eat!

Year-End Difficulties – Can't Muster Enthusiasm

The year-end cannot stir up enthusiasm in people's hearts, but the abacuses of government offices in Guilin City are clattering at a sky-high pace. Settling accounts and budgets have muddled the minds of impoverished officials. As soon as the provincial government opens its books, let alone next year, they don't even know how to manage this year-end. The money problem is very troublesome. It was only with great difficulty that the Provincial Chairman flew to Nanjing and borrowed 260 million to get through the year. In the blink of an eye, it is again a "lucky" New Year. The budget for the thirty-sixth year is still short. Therefore, in desperation, the cry for layoffs and reduced government is heard again. It is estimated that after the first day of the Lunar New Year, one out of five government officials eating outside Wen Chang Gate will disappear. The list of layoffs has not yet been announced, and the junior staff are as anxious as ants on a hot pot. Judging by their mood, it is even more awkward than when shop owners invite their employees to an "heartless meal" at the end of the year. Those who are laid off are laid off, with no placement or aftercare. Those with children and families must continue to support them. A family of eight is not a family of eight. The most tragic thing is that flesh and blood cannot be cut off, and they must still live. Please tell me, in the time from New Year's Eve to New Year's Day, in that moment of darkness and light, how many heavy sighs can you hear?

Grain Tax – Urge and Delay

Every year is difficult, but every year must be passed. Originally, the year-end and the end of the year are the total aggregation of hardship. Whoever can get through it can take a breath from under the heavy pressure, and then they have to calculate the great disaster of the coming year. Unfortunately, few people can get through the year-end, and many cannot. Looking at the end of the lunar month, one cannot help but think of the grain tax that must be paid by the end of the year. In recent days, the Grain Bureau has dispatched staff to various counties to urge payment, and the counties have also dispatched staff to various townships to urge payment. An ax, a handle, a thin slice, linked together constitute a tense picture. For the sake of administration, the government cannot be without rice. For the lack of rice, the farmers have forgotten the government's orders. Between urging and delaying, I vaguely remember hearing many of the most unpleasant stories. However, I don't want to write them; as soon as I write them down, it will be two lines of tears...

Rent Reduction – Superficial Implementation

What benefits do farmers get from reducing grain and rent? When Chairman Huang met with Chairman Chiang, Chairman Chiang instructed that the 25% rent reduction should be thoroughly implemented, but as soon as it was implemented, some counties reported "no landlords or tenant farmers at all." Some places even superficially implemented rent reduction, with landlords returning a portion of the rent grain to tenant farmers, but as soon as the supervisors left, the tenant farmers carried the grain back to the landlord's house, simply putting on a show!

The more painful things there are, the more absurd things there are. In the past two weeks, the Guilin market has always seen an unsuppressible resentment towards relief workers. From seeing refugees being driven away to the stinky rice brought in by the relief branch office, and then to the case of deducting disaster relief grain by the ounce per pound of stinky rice, sometimes emotions surge. When I see the bloated and greasy officials of the branch office acting hypocritically, I really want to run up to this group of scoundrels and slap them twice!

Difficulties – Filled with Indignation

The Guilin refugee shelter has more than a thousand refugees, who have been living a miserable life for five months. Not to mention that one-twelfth have died of illness and starvation, the relief branch office is also going to dissolve it at the end of the year, asking this group of white-haired people to "fend for themselves." Each person is given ninety catties of stinky rice in one go and must leave. The relief branch office tricked the refugees into signing a document, saying that it was a receipt for receiving rice. Who knew that when they opened it later, it was actually a deed of "willingly fending for themselves." For a time, the refugees were filled with unspeakable grief and indignation and appealed to all sectors of society. After all parties questioned the Guilin relief branch office, the refugees were sent to various relief centers for placement. Otherwise, there would have been another group of wronged souls who died miserably under the banner of "relief."

Stinky Rice – Refused to Accept

Since the relief branch office transported dozens of tons of stinky broken rice to Guilin and was rejected by the relevant authorities, the relief branch office sent a telegram stating: "Broken rice is better than tree bark and grass roots. If you refuse to accept it again, it will not be distributed." There is a great sense of "take it or leave it; if you don't want it, you won't even have broken rice." The Guilin office of the branch office publicly declared: "Fit for us to eat, we don't have time to care," which further aroused public outrage. Sacks of stinky rice were everywhere. The chairman of the Guilin City Council angrily cursed, "The relief branch office simply looks down on the common people; the relief branch office is not a benefactor, and the disaster victims are not beggars." However, let them laugh and curse as they please, the relief branch office is still shouting, "Come, eat!" If you don't come, you don't come. The gentlemen of the branch office won't starve to death. Alas, such relief truly fulfills a saying of the Buddhist family: "It cannot be said, it cannot be said!" How infuriating, how infuriating!

As the New Year approaches, I want to say something auspicious, but my chest is full of depression, which almost makes me forget that this is still a human world. Forcing myself to smile through a bitter face, I can't smile!

From the depths of my heart, I angrily shout, "God, may the final day of judgment come sooner!"

The Wonders of the Taitung Tianlong Bridge (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)

### Travel to Taitung – Going to Hualien Port

— Taipei Air Dispatch, 18th Our Special Correspondent Chang Jiang Muyun

The East Taiwan Inspection Team left Taitung County on the afternoon of December 8th. On the eve of their departure, they held a special welcome meeting in the theater. This meeting was the first grand event in Taitung after the Retrocession because government personnel rarely came, and domestic and foreign inspection teams regarded the eastern part as a restricted area. They longed for the government's concern, just like they longed for the warm currents of the Pacific Ocean.

At this meeting, we saw the smiling faces of thousands of people and thunderous cheers, which symbolized the voices from the bottom of the hearts of the people of East Taiwan! Director Ren announced the government's determination to develop East Taiwan in front of the public and also helped them solve the practical problems of long-awaited construction. We also saw the dances of the young men and women of the Gaoshan tribe. They welcomed the inspection team with the most enthusiastic emotions and the most genuine performances. This was not a simple dance. It had the original taste of nature, but it also had an artistic flavor, a sharp and harmonious four-part chorus, which made people forget that they were Gaoshan compatriots. The genius of music and dance is eagerly waiting for the discovery of dancers and musicians. They hope that Dai Ailian can come to this desolate city.

Taitung Line – Typhoon is the Greatest Threat

From Taitung to Hualien Port, there is a railway, with a total length of 177 kilometers. When the inspection team decided to depart, the three trains running daily, one of which was a VIP steam train, had been reserved for the exclusive use of the inspection team. We were very interested in having a more comfortable special train to enjoy during the long journey. This line was only about one hundred li long in the late Qing Dynasty, but now it is 175.9 kilometers long, with 39 stations under its jurisdiction.

According to the Railroad Committee's Chief Engineer Zhang Zhongsong, the biggest threat and the strongest destructive force to the Taitung Line is the typhoon. The entire line passes through 102 streams, the largest of which are about three. A very large amount is spent annually on maintenance and repair projects, which affects traffic. The fastest repairs also take two or three days. Therefore, in the strong wind season, transportation in eastern Taiwan is prone to being disrupted. However, the 1,300 employees fully demonstrate the power to overcome nature. Among these personnel, distributed at the stations along the line, more than 97% are local Taiwanese, and the stationmasters are all appointed by them. Recently, in order to maintain their livelihood, the Transportation Department had to slightly increase fares to subsidize them, but in fact, it is still difficult to balance revenue and expenditure. The current monthly income is 2.6 million New Taiwan Dollars, but the expenditure is more than 6 million. The government's painstaking efforts to maintain transportation are even more visible in the sparsely populated eastern part.

The car sped through the small stations at a speed of 60 yards, and the stationmasters and employees stood at attention to show their respect. When the car passed Zhutian in eastern Taiwan, it was raining, and the mountains were swallowed up by the low-pressure rain clouds. The wind blew from the streams and valleys through the desolate wilderness, through the sugarcane fields, and through the low wooden houses, and everyone felt the chill and had to put on a sweater!

Transportation Network – Eastern Taiwan's Income is Only 100,000

Xu Shangzhen, the general manager of the Transportation Company, sat next to the reporter. Whenever he mentioned transportation in Taitung, he said: The government knows that transportation on the Taitung Line will lose money, but it cannot be compared with merchants, who will not do it if they see a loss! The Transportation Company is actually an organization that undertakes joint freight transportation. As long as passengers and goods are handed over to it, it can be transported to the designated area. The handling fee is no more than ten yuan per ton, and if the loss exceeds the agreed amount, it must be compensated. The freight is paid by the company first, which can be said to be responsible for transportation.

The company has more than 3,000 employees, about 300 of whom are distributed in eastern Taiwan. From the perspective of transportation in the entire province, Taitung is actually a burden. The total monthly income is 20 million New Taiwan Dollars, but the eastern part, including Luodong and Yilan, is only 560,000 yuan; Taitung and Hualien Port are less than 100,000 yuan. In terms of transportation volume, in the most prosperous period before the war, the daily railway freight transportation was about 20,000 tons up and down. Before the Retrocession, it once dropped to more than 2,000 tons per day, but now it has increased to 8,000 to 9,000 tons. The eastern part has always maintained several thousand tons. From Taitung to Hualien Port, the main transportation is grain. In the past, when transportation from Suao to Hualien Port was cut off for three months, it completely relied on the Taitung No. 1 and sailing ships, which traveled at 9 knots per hour, which not only maintained freight transportation but also maintained passenger transportation. Then he happily said that at present, the income and expenditure of transportation in the eastern part can be kept in balance, and the round-the-island transportation network has been completed. In the future, if there is a regular airline to Taitung, the transportation of sugar, cement, salt, and food in the eastern part will be much smoother, and the price difference between the producing area and the actual selling area will not be too great due to the transportation by road trucks alone; the people of the eastern part can no longer bear the extra burden caused by transportation!

Round-the-Island Line – Construction Costs 200 Million

Taiwan is surrounded by the sea on all sides, with a coastline of 1,139.243 kilometers. The railway lines laid on the island, in the northern part and the Taixi Plain to the southern part, and the railways privately established by various production enterprises form a railway network. The East Taiwan Railway is built in the Taitung Plain between the Central Mountain Range and the Coastal Mountain Range, forming a round-the-island railway with the western line; because the central part is full of towering mountains, the central transverse railway and highway have not yet been established.

The Japanese originally built the Southern Transverse Highway from Pingtung to Zhiben in Taitung, with a total length of 137.4 kilometers; according to Director Fei, the Japanese once passed an engineering truck on this highway, but military vehicles never drove on it, and most of the roadbed was damaged. In terms of transportation in the entire province, this line has no significant meaning. The Japanese were mainly afraid of the Allied forces landing in the south, and this was a retreat route for them to escape. In fact, the highway around the southernmost tip is only a dozen kilometers longer in the total mileage, and it would be a loss to spend this huge sum of money to build a highway. There is also the Central Transverse Highway, from Taichung to Fuli via Puli for 41 kilometers, which is now open to traffic. From Fuli across the towering mountains to the eastern Tongmen for 70 kilometers, it still needs to be repaired, which is estimated to cost 90 million New Taiwan Dollars. At present, the Bureau has decided to repair the Tongmen suspension bridge first because the bridge deck was destroyed by strong winds, but the iron cables can still be used, so it needs to be repaired urgently and has been decided to be completed starting next year. If this central highway is opened up, passing through the Central Mountain Range to Taitung, there will be no need to detour to the southern or northern parts of the island.

In fact, the lifeline of transportation in the eastern part is completely tied to the rapid connection of the round-the-island railway. The Japanese used to build a railway from Luodong to the end of the Taiping Mountain railway in Tuchang, passing through Taiping Mountain, Nanhu Mountain, Central Jianshan, and entering the Sanzan north of Hualien Port on Qingshui Mountain. They had already spent a measurement fee for this mountain line, which is more than 100 kilometers away. According to Engineer Zhang's plan, the Japanese were prepared to spend 10 million yuan six years ago, but now it is two hundred times more, at 2 billion yuan, which is 1.18 billion yuan less than building the coastal line. It is estimated that after one year of measurement, the construction of a light railway line will be started first. Director Ren knows that this line is the lifeline of eastern Taiwan. Although he is not sure that he can decide on the engineering fee, which has a huge number, he is doing his best to encourage people who are familiar with the route to accompany Lin Zebi, the director of the Kaohsiung Port Bureau specially dispatched by the Transportation Department, to sell land for inspection. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he measured the Xudian Railway and believes that the preliminary investigation of this line can be successfully completed. Director Ren told reporters that the Public Works Department will start the construction of the Zhutian Railway this year. If the round-the-island railway can be completed, Chief Chen's reputation in Taiwan will last forever because he can complete the project that the Japanese could not complete in fifty years!

On the South Sea – Green Island and Orchid Island

In the eastern part, we looked out at the Pacific Ocean, and with binoculars, we could clearly see the cliffs of Green Island, which is 29 nautical miles away. Orchid Island is 70 nautical miles south of Taitung. These two isolated islands in the South Sea belong to Taitung County. Because the itinerary of the inspection team was decided, it was a pity that we could not conduct on-the-spot investigations.

Orchid Island is 38 li in circumference and is inhabited by 1,273 Yami people, which is an eight-hour sea voyage from Taitung. According to Section Chief Wang Yuren, the Meteorological Bureau sent staff to work on the island. When they arrived, it was raining heavily, and they were soaked all over. In a moment, the sky cleared, and the sun was shining brightly, and their clothes were all dried. Because it is windy here, the houses are very low. From a plane view, they are single-story houses, but in reality, they are three-story buildings like pits: the lower layer is earth, covered with thatch, for warmth in winter, the middle layer is used in spring and autumn, and the upper layer is suitable for summer.

### The YVA in the Shanxi-Shaanxi Plateau – Hukou and Longmen

— Air Dispatch, 14th Our Xi'an Correspondent Li Chi

Water conservancy expert Dr. Savage and his party flew from Henan to Ningxia on the 13th. Few people know that he stopped over at the E County Airport, 40 kilometers southwest of Xi'an, for a moment and left the first footprint on the "Shanxi-Shaanxi Plateau." Recently, there have been fewer airmail flights. Perhaps by the time this dispatch arrives in Shanghai, his party has already flown back to Shaanxi, visited the achievements of water conservancy construction in the province, and surveyed many water sources with utilization value. The former includes the benefiting area of irrigation canals, and the latter mainly refers to the 65-kilometer Yellow River channel from Hukou to Longmen. Baoji Gorge, 15 kilometers east of Baoji, was also seen incidentally.

Two Points of Water Conservancy to be Proud Of

When talking about water conservancy, Shaanxi Province has two points to be proud of: first, it started early and has a long history; second, it is effective and improves every year. For example, the exquisite canals built in ancient times still exist today. Mr. Li Yizhi devoted his life to water conservancy in Shaanxi Province and eventually sacrificed his life. Fortunately, his "second generation" is continuing his work. At present, there are canals in the province with a length of up to 120 kilometers, irrigating more than 1.6 million mu of benefited cultivated land (mainly cotton and grain fields). In addition to these, there are also more than 3,000 horsepower of hydroelectric power, which are not well known, distributed in Nanzheng in southern Shaanxi and Mei County east of Baoji. However, Savage's trip was not for sightseeing; his greater task was to formulate a comprehensive plan for governing the Yellow River, including passively preventing "Yellow River disasters" and actively utilizing water power and dredging navigation. In other words, to simultaneously reduce disasters and increase benefits in a scissor-shaped manner.

From Hekou to Tongguan, the Yellow River is precisely the natural provincial boundary between Shanxi and Shaanxi. However, the 600-kilometer-long and one-kilometer-wide river is not convenient for navigation, and the Yellow River, which contains unlimited power, is allowed to cause floods everywhere downstream. Please take a closer look at the light blue ribbon representing the Yellow River on the map. When it reaches the area between Yichuan, Shaanxi, and Jixian, Shanxi, it narrows into a black line? This narrow mouth is Hukou, which is mentioned below. Further south, when it reaches the area between Hancheng, Shaanxi, and Hejin, Shanxi, that is, Longmen, which is mentioned below, it widens again and joins the Fenhe River mouth. Between Hukou and Longmen, the Yellow River channel narrows greatly. Although the rolling river water has the power to overturn mountains and seas, it can only surge in the narrow valleys, and the narrower the valley, the greater the water power. This section of the river channel has been mentioned in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings as being used as a hydroelectric power plant, "white coal," and is equally important as the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River and the Xijiang River in Guangdong. Unfortunately, it has still been "empty talk on paper" for decades. If it is successfully completed one day in the future, it will undoubtedly be the second "Yangtze Valley Authority" (YVA) between the Shanxi-Shaanxi Plateau. According to the most optimistic estimate, it can electrify the four provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong and the "Longhai" and other three railways, irrigate 4 million mu of cultivated land, and partially open navigation along the line. There is also the most surprising function: as long as a reservoir dam with a height of only 150 meters is built at a suitable location in this section, 12 billion cubic meters of Yellow River water upstream can be stored without leaking a drop. Within half a century, there will be no flood disasters downstream!

What our water conservancy experts expect from Savage this time is to have him, based on various available and relevant data, plus on-the-spot surveys, provide his valuable opinions.

Hukou Narrow Stream and Rapid Waterfall

Hukou is 15 kilometers east and west of Yichuan County. When the Yellow River reaches this place, the 400-500 meter wide river channel gradually narrows to 200-300 meters. The steep slopes on both sides are not high, only more than 10 meters, but under the riverbed, there is a deep ditch that is one kilometer long, and its width and depth are both about 20-30 meters. The Yellow River water upstream flows to this place and all flows into this deep ditch, Hukou. The surging water is like fog, like a flying waterfall, and the roar is like thunder. It is indeed a spectacle! The ancients said that this place is "nine li and three fen deep," but after investigation, it is known to be an exaggeration. Every year from November to March of spring, the 600-700 meter wide waterfall is frozen like a chain. According to a foreigner's record in 1905, the ice pillars had not yet melted in May of that year. This scene reminds people of the ancient poem "Only now the day the ice melts on the riverbank, is the time when the flowers fall in Chang'an." After the ice melts, Hukou becomes a flying waterfall again, but this phenomenon does not occur during floods. Near the lower end of the deep ditch, there are two small stone islands protruding from the water surface for several meters, called "Mengmen." In the past, someone planned to use these small islands to build a reservoir dam.

What attracts attention to Hukou is this narrow stream and rapid waterfall, which may be used for hydroelectric power generation. According to a relatively old survey by the Geological Survey Institute (August 1932), Hukou has a flow of more than 8,000 cubic meters per second. According to another report, the water level difference at Hukou is about 20 meters. Mr. Li Huatian of the former Yellow River Conservancy Commission was the most optimistic in his estimate, believing that "building a 55-meter high dam at Hukou can generate 3 million horsepower." However, another extremely conservative estimate said that it only has 300,000 horsepower. In addition, many others have made different estimates. According to the latest resurvey by the "Yellow River Treatment Research Group" and the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau in October this year, their conclusion greatly revises the estimates of the predecessors. Among them, Mr. Guan Wenqi believes that "Hukou is purely named after a deep ditch at the bottom of the river. Although there may be a "drop" of several meters or dozens of meters underwater, tens of thousands of horsepower may be generated, but the deep ditch is narrow and cannot be utilized. Even if a method is found to draw water out of the channel, the downstream bearing point is deep under the riverbed, and construction management is absolutely difficult. Mengmen Island is too small to have any significance for a high dam. In summary, the geological conditions and river channel conditions are not sufficient to be a high dam site." The long freezing period of Hukou is also a shortcoming.

As of now, the opinions of experts such as Zhang Hanying, the head of the "Treatment Research Group," Liu Zhongrui, the director of the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, and Cao Ruizhi, the newly appointed director of the Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, have generally agreed that Hukou's value is not as good as Longmen's, which is described below.

Estimates for Dam Construction at Longmen

After the Yellow River passes Mengmen, it widens to 700-800 meters. When it reaches Shimen Gorge, the river narrows to about 100 meters, and the cliffs on both sides are also 100 meters high. Then it widens again at Sanlilang, and then narrows to a 60-meter narrow mouth at Longmen and Yumen Pass. Water conservancy experts are still fiercely discussing this section of the Yellow River.

According to the latest resurvey results, Mr. Guan Wenqi believes that both Shimen Gorge and Sanlilang have the conditions for building a reservoir dam, but he rejects Shimen Gorge. The "Treatment Research Group" also generally believes that the value near Shimen Gorge is the greatest. According to Guan's estimate, building a 150-meter-high reservoir dam can store 13 billion cubic meters of Yellow River water. Considering that the average annual flow of the Yellow River in the Longmen area is 400 cubic meters per second, only 12.6 billion cubic meters of Yellow River water will flow down throughout the year. After this dam is built, it can of course completely store the upstream water for use. However, whether there are loopholes under the geological formation remains to be verified.

According to historical records of the Yellow River hydrology, the largest flood was 18,000 cubic meters per second. Assuming that the flood lasts for two consecutive days, each upper 10 meters of the reservoir after this dam is built can accommodate a flood as large as the one mentioned above. By extension, there will be no flood disasters downstream for decades. The amount of sediment transported by the Yellow River near Yumen Pass is 2%, so it is estimated that this dam has a lifespan of 50 years.

If this reservoir is used to generate electricity, how much electricity will be generated? Because the numbers used by the experts are different, their conclusions also have great differences. Guan estimates that it can generate "350,000 horsepower, electrifying areas within 200 miles of Shanxi and Shaanxi, and irrigating 4 million mu of cultivated land." Cao Duanzhi believes that it can obtain 1.3 million horsepower, irrigate 20 million mu of cultivated land, and electrify the "Pinghan," "Tongpu," and "Longhai" railways, transmitting electricity as far as Ping, Tianjin, Tianshui, and Shandong. Another estimate by the "Yellow River Commission" is the smallest, only 300,000 horsepower.

However, we believe that after Mr. Savage and his party return from their inspection, they will immediately correct the above-mentioned disparate figures and obtain similar conclusions.

### On Poetic Rhymes

— Huang Lou

Many people doubt the old poetic rhymes. Naturally, they are things of the past, but they have their evolution, their history, and their function and value. The poetic rhymes we have commonly used for the last few hundred years were compiled by Wang Wenyu of PingShui during the Jin Dynasty, so they are commonly called the PingShui Rhymes. How did he come to have such authority? Because he had already combined the 206 rhyme groups of the Song Dynasty's Guangyun into 107 rhyme groups. For example, Guangyun is "one dong, two dong, three zhong, four jiang, five zhi, six zhi, seven zhi, eight wei," while PingShui is "one dong, two dong, three jiang, four zhi, five wei," which is much simpler. However, its principle still adheres to the old extended rhyme, and Guangyun is derived from Tang Sun Xu's Tangyun, and Tangyun is based on Sui Lu Yan's Qieyun. The Sui Dynasty was an era when southern culture moved north, reorganizing and dominating the Central Plains culture that had gradually collapsed under the influence of foreign customs after the Yongjia period. In terms of phonetics, it had to accommodate the characteristics of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River basins, encompassing all and not favoring one over the other. The book Qieyun was indeed a product of the times, capable of echoing politics and providing a tool for communication and integration between the north and south, Han and non-Han, which was by no means meaningless. Language is irrational; we can only adapt to language with rhyme books and cannot unify language with rhyme books. Although rhyme books are the universally recognized standard, there are many slightly remote places where they do not conform to actual pronunciation. Therefore, there is a joke about Hu Zeng in the Complete Tang Poems. Hu Zeng was from present-day Hunan, and he could not distinguish between "shi" (石) and "shi" (十), "yin" (陰) and "yin" (因). In the Tang Dynasty, everyone knew that these two words could not be pronounced the same way. Shi (石) was Shik, Shi (十) was Shit, Yin (陰) was Yim, and Yin (因) was Yin. Today, Cantonese speakers still distinguish them very clearly. It is likely that at that time, the pronunciation based on the rhyme book was quite similar to modern Mandarin—Putonghua—and it was acceptable for reading, writing, and general social communication.

Looking at how detailed the Tangyun division is, it is evident that it was not done rashly, but rather a great deal of effort was spent on compromise and analysis to achieve this. Although the standard was detailed, it was not very strict when used in rhyming prose. As long as it was not wrong in principle, even with the strictness of rhythmic prose and regulated verse, it could still be flexible. In practice, they did not feel too restricted.

Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty once compiled the Hongwu Zheng Yun, wanting to correct many pronunciations that seemed incompatible with the times to make them more practical. However, it failed, and the PingShui Rhymes continued to be used without change. What is the reason why Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, who was so fond of being clever and dissatisfied with the status quo, could not succeed in reforming the rhyme book? At that time, a better standard could not be found. It is not possible to arbitrarily change things based on subjective opinions. If you find it easy to pronounce, you cannot ignore whether others find it easy to pronounce. How can that be? Moreover, the sound of a word is also related to its form. Any changes would have too many repercussions.

Indeed, in fact, the people of the Song Dynasty already did not abide by the old rhymes when writing lyrics, and there were so-called lyric rhymes. However, the habit of Song people writing lyrics was just to avoid being constrained by rhymes and only taking a general approximation. When reading or singing, they probably had to slightly change the original sound. Otherwise, how could words from the Zhi, Wei, and Qi rhyme groups be pronounced smoothly together? Also, if people from Fujian during the Song Dynasty used "He" (何) to rhyme with "Gao" (高) and "Lao" (老) and "Suo" (鎖) together when writing prose and lyrics, we would have to learn to speak with a Fujian accent to pronounce them.

While rhyme books are originally made to accommodate language, the pronunciation of rhyming prose should probably also slightly accommodate the rhyme book.

The division of the PingShui Rhymes is very scientific. Explained with Roman letters, it is roughly as follows:

Dong ong Dong jing Jiang ong Zhi i Wei ei Yu iu Yu

ou Qi Jia Hui ai Zhen in Wen en Yuan eun Han oen Shan an

Xian ien Xiao Hao iao Hao ao Ge o Ma a Yang ang Geng eng

Qing ing Zheng êng You iou Qin im Tan am Yan iem Xian iam

The above are level tones. The rising, departing, and entering tones follow this pattern.

The entering tone rhymes are divided into three parts: (1) ending in k, (2) ending in t, (3) ending in p. Cantonese is completely the same as this.

Being able to understand the principles of rhyme division is beneficial for understanding dialects from various places. As a Chinese person, one should always understand several important dialects. Therefore, rhymes should also be understood. For example, knowing that the words of the Qi rhyme group are pronounced with the ai vowel in ancient sounds and in the Ao language, we know that the Cantonese "wife" is tsai, "title" is tai, and "chicken" is gai. Knowing that the Han rhyme group is oen and the Shan rhyme group is an, we know that in Wu dialect, "official" and "pass," "finish" and "ring," and "dry" and "idle" are not pronounced the same.

### Avoiding Vulgarity

— Yu Jianhua

Western painting emphasizes beauty, while Chinese painting emphasizes elegance. The opposite of beauty is ugliness, and the opposite of elegance is vulgarity. If vulgarity is not removed, elegance cannot come. Painting flaws can all be cured, but only vulgarity cannot be cured. Those who are accustomed to vulgarity can be cured, but those who are born vulgar cannot be cured. Shen Xiyuan discussed avoiding vulgarity, saying:

"Vulgarity in painting can be roughly divided into five types: those who neither like to imitate ancient masters nor can create their own unique ideas, simply laying out things in a straightforward and monotonous manner, are called vulgar in style. Those who purely use ink washes, only showing patches of white and black, without any trace of brushwork, are called vulgar in rhythm. Those whose style is no different from others, but whose brushwork is stagnant and whose ink is dull, are called vulgar in spirit. Those who cling to the instruction of vulgar teachers, do not understand the ancient way of using the brush, or whose brushstrokes are dry like a bowstring, or whose brushstrokes are stiff like a brush, originally mediocre and unremarkable, but deliberately trying to be unconventional to shock the world, or arbitrarily creating sharp edges and corners, deliberately affecting a posed manner, are called vulgar in brushwork. Those who do not take subjects from ancient famous sages' deeds and elegant themes, but only take flattering praise of prosperity and all matters that are not suitable for poetry, are called vulgar in subject matter. -- Only by removing these five vulgarities can one approach elegance." -- Compilation of Learning to Paint from Mustard Seed Garden

In addition to the stylistic vulgarity, rhythmic vulgarity, spiritual vulgarity, brushwork vulgarity, and subject matter vulgarity discussed by Shen, there are many other types of vulgarity. Roughly speaking, there are still the following twelve types:

Crude vulgarity -- Crude brushstrokes and large leaves, arbitrarily smearing, only seeking to connect things, without any rules. Those who study Xu Tianchi, Bada Shanren, and Wu Changshuo often commit this fault.

Wild vulgarity -- Drawing swords and stringing bows, colors and ink running rampant, only seeking pleasure, without any restraint. Those who study the Zhe School often commit this fault.

Rigid vulgarity -- Exposing sinews and bones, with many angles and few curves, only seeking strength, without any gentleness. Those who study Shen Shitian and Lan Tianshu often commit this fault.

Soft vulgarity -- Weak brushstrokes, depicting heads and drawing feet, only seeking softness, without any boldness. Those who study Hua Xinluo and Mei Qushan often commit this fault.

Flattering vulgarity -- Delicate and charming, coquettish, only seeking elegance, lacking vigor. Those who study Yun Nantian often commit this fault.

Inky vulgarity -- Ink washes and halos, misty and distant, only seeing ink color, not seeing brushwork. Those who study Mi Nangong often commit this fault. The vulgarity of the modern Wu Naixian is particularly evident.

Colorful vulgarity -- Red and green mixed together, resplendent with gold and jade, only seeking beauty, with very little clarity. Those who study blue-green landscapes and meticulous flower-and-bird paintings often commit this fault.

Draft vulgarity -- Lacking hills and valleys in the chest, without changes in the brush, copying the past and changing the order, almost like a printing plate. Those who study Wang Luntai often commit this fault. The modern Wu Daiqiu was also unable to avoid it.

Strange vulgarity -- Coming from outside the sky, creating independently, the strangeness is not reasonable, the weirdness is close to absurdity. Those who study Shi Tao and Bada often commit this fault.

Clumsy vulgarity -- Broken and fragmented, ancient and clumsy, striving for stiffness, without any fluency. Those who study Jin Dongxin often commit this fault.

Heavy vulgarity -- Accumulating brushstrokes and ink, striving for thickness, the whole picture is dark, with no distinction between light and shade. Those who study Gong Banqian often commit this fault.

Comprehensive vulgarity -- Seeking perfection and completeness, everything that should be there is there, objects are mixed together, like a department store, embellishing scenes and offering blessings, fulfilling every request. Those who sell paintings in Shanghai often commit this fault.

Those who create it boast of their unique discovery, and those who admire it fall into habit. Once a painting falls into habit, there is no one who is not vulgar, because it only has the appearance of a certain school but not the spirit of that school. The above-mentioned masters were never vulgar, but those who study them fall into vulgarity.

### Portrait of Lady Rubens

— Lü Bansi

Rubens (1577-1640) was a representative writer of the Flemish School. His style is extremely realistic, and his colors are like gold, both seductive and sweet. In his later years, many students followed him. He was good at large-scale compositions. His output was even more astonishing. According to historians' estimates, Rubens's works, from the moment he was born until the moment he was buried, in the short 63 years, even if he didn't sleep or eat and painted non-stop, he still couldn't have painted so much. It was later proved that many paintings were helped by his students, and he only made revisions. But this portrait is an exception, because it was painted by him in his youth for his newly married wife. ( )

### The Purple Skirt

— Ye Cao

One morning, in a misty drizzle, the road was very slippery. A twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy stood in the middle of a bridge over the Suzhou Creek, his face delicate and handsome, his figure thin and weak, alone, looking up at the clouds in the mist: barefoot, wearing a purple skirt.

As I approached him, he turned his face, revealing a flawless smile, pure, without any desire or intention to exploit anything, looking at me indifferently.

He had a pair of beautiful eyes, round and large and luminous, filled with wisdom and joy, as if he didn't understand what sorrow and sadness were!

Except for his face, his ears, neck, legs, hands, and feet seemed unwashed for years, black, covered with a layer of dirt. His nails were long, growing on the tips of his thin fingers. His hair was not very long, nor too messy, just quite dirty on top; raindrops were like dewdrops pinned to the dirty areas.

That skirt was outstanding, the only thing on him that was the cleanest. He wore a black shirt on top, and over it, a worn-out gray cotton velvet vest.

In the evening, I saw him standing on the other side of the bridge.

Three days later, we seemed a bit familiar. When I passed by him again, he suddenly greeted me with a smile, nonchalantly saying to me:

"Give me two hundred yuan!"

I gave him a five-hundred-yuan bill instead. He took it and ran away quickly. His shadow disappeared into the crowd. From his tone and that strong energy, he was probably a boy!

I didn't see him for two days.

On the third day, he appeared again; he no longer stood there, but ran back and forth quickly from this side to the other side of the bridge. He seemed to have joined a gang and was rushing to push rickshaws across the bridge. I was glad for him in my heart that he finally had a job.

He had his hair cut, and his skirt was washed exceptionally purple, much cleaner than before; he lived happily, had not yet learned to worry, in his pure little heart.

Once, he pushed a rickshaw across the bridge, and the passenger didn't have much change, only giving him forty yuan. He happily accepted it; a larger child next to him reached out and snatched the money, slapping it on his face and cursing:

"Useless, forty yuan is enough for you to do!"

"If you don't want it, I'll take it!" he dodged, mumbling with a smile, picking up the bills one by one. Meeting me face to face, he showed a familiar smile, running to the other end of the bridge in a puff of smoke.

It was getting cold. Because of poor diet, I suffered from severe malaria for almost ten days; in my illness, I missed this child in the purple skirt; I decided to talk to him after I recovered, and ask about his background; this child was too lovable!

After eating breakfast, I walked towards that bridge. On the way, outside the threshold of a closed warehouse, a group of people huddled together, looking down at the ground with worried faces.

"Froze to death last night, was still alive yesterday..." someone said.

Looking through the cracks in the crowd, I saw a small corpse lying there, covered with some tattered cotton batting on the upper body, a smile still hanging on the face, and a purple skirt covering the stiff legs.

### Small Scenes on the River

— Yuan Wei

I. Sandstone

When the river water recedes, the dark brown sandstone, like a group of dragons, slowly raises its spine, exposing it to the sun. Why not hibernate? Could it be waiting for another ice age? The dark brown sandstone is also like the bulbs of daffodils, buried firmly by the white sandy beach, and shallowly moistened by the emerald green river water. How long before it is the season for them to sprout? How long before they all burst open at the same time, opening up a river full of flowers, as brilliant as brocade; a single flower like a canopy, propping up the boatmen to rest, giving those hurried boats a place to anchor in the shade?

When the river water recedes, the dark brown sandstone is only silently lingered on by the eternal birds.

II. Pebbles

Countless pebbles gleam in the morning sun. Who was it that caught the countless stars in the Milky Way last night and poured them onto this emerald green river? Or are the stars merely the dim shadows of the pebbles? The pebbles are at the mercy of the capricious river, which sighs mournfully at them day and night in winter; but in spring and summer, it tramples on them as it rushes, races, and roars out thunderous torrents. As a result, they have completely lost their sharp edges and corners, but the essence of the pebbles is still generally hard; although powerless to prevent so much crushing and stripping, time will ultimately prove that it is only the outer form that is affected.

Travelers on the river, shining in the morning sun, may you also have an essence that can contend with time!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 135

— Ye Jingfeng

Bored on the plane, everyone was reading newspapers by the light to relieve boredom. When everyone discovered this short note, they all seemed to have been injected with a stimulant, and suddenly became active, but because the plane was roaring, it was inconvenient to talk, so they could only point at the newspaper and make gestures to each other; some circled the short note with a pen and passed it around for everyone to see, and some were even more nosy, simply tearing down the short note and taking down the message board installed on the plane, which had ready-made paper clips and blank pages, clipping the short note on it, writing their own opinions on the blank pages, and circulating them among each other. One reckless fellow, with a bit of schadenfreude, collected the newspapers and message boards and handed them to Tsurumi in a pile. After Tsurumi read the short note, he carefully discussed the opinions on the message boards, one by one.

"If I were a samurai disciple, I would rather give up my life and parachute down to Befu to compete with those challengers." Someone wrote this.

"No, if the other party dares to challenge, they must be masters in the 'way'. If we fight, I'm afraid we won't be confident!" ... Another person wrote this.

"That's not right, I don't think victory or defeat matters. Stepping forward is a brave expression of the samurai way—in any case, it's much more noble than the cowardly act of running away" ...

"I think people who challenge like this are unreasonable; people become officials by using their skills, regardless of what kind of skills they are. Even if they win the battle, the official is still an official, and the superior won't necessarily demote him or discuss it. However, the victor won't necessarily get an official position, haha, baka..."

Tsurumi, thanks to the reckless fellow's kindness, showed him these wonderful articles, and at that time expressed his gratitude for his attention. He remained silently sitting there, ignoring the actions of those fools. He lowered his head and pondered for only a few minutes, then suddenly took out his notebook and the mechanical pencil that had been inspected by the secretary in Befu, quickly wrote two lines, and pressed the button next to him. The flight attendant came, and Tsurumi tore off the note he had written and handed it to the flight attendant, deliberately saying loudly the two words "urgent telegram". The flight attendant took the note and left in response.

The other fellows on the trip, seeing Tsurumi's action, of course caused another commotion, and of course there were many speculations, simply regarding this matter as more concerning than their own victory in battle or promotion in rank. Yet who knew that all of this was part of Tsurumi's plan to search for the "Seven Secret Letters" tonight!

What did Tsurumi write on that "urgent telegram"?

"To the Director of the Telecommunications Department of the General Staff Headquarters, I happened to read the extra edition of tonight's second battle news on the plane, and learned that a small number of unruly people have demonstrated and challenged me, a meaningless action, which is not worth bothering about. However, the fact that the bandits designated Prime Minister Jun's Befu may be a ruse, with other dangerous intentions. I beg you to be vigilant and relay this to the special forces on duty. I am on urgent official business and unable to deal with these petty people, which seems to lack courage, but in fact, I also do not intend to act impulsively, neglecting official duties because of private fights. However, I am extremely apprehensive that this has alarmed Prime Minister Jun. I humbly request that this be conveyed to all news agencies and relevant parties. Tsurumi Yu".

At this time, the plane had been flying for more than twenty minutes since it took off from Tokyo, heading towards the Kobe-Nagasaki route, and had flown quite a distance. While the people in the seats were still enthusiastically using the message boards to express their opinions, they suddenly felt a special vibration in the plane, as if it was circling. Just as everyone was surprised, they saw the co-pilot come out of the small door at the front of the plane, looking nervous, holding a piece of paper in his hand, like a telegraph form, waving it at the public, and handing it to the person in the first row of seats; meaning to let everyone pass it around.

### Wall

— Hu Shuo

In our ancient history, there is only the story of Youchao氏 (the Nest Builder) inventing "constructing wood for dwellings," but there is no mention of the origin of walls. In ancient times, when people ended their primitive life in the mountains and fields and built warm "nests" with thin pieces of wood, they were initially satisfied and happy. However, when a rainstorm came, followed by a flood, the wooden nests turned into floating boats, and they complained about the incompetence of Youchao氏, the inventor.

After all, humans are the most intelligent animals. They finally conquered nature with wisdom and overcame the obstacles of life. Since some unknown era, they invented walls. From then on, human life took another step towards civilization. They used gray-brown bricks to glue white clay, building high cliff-like walls around themselves. As a result, people were no longer afraid of floods. Their lives were like a pile of winding tree roots. They burrowed into the wall holes and lived on the soil. The days passed more and more stably and securely.

Walls brought people warmth and tranquility. Within the walls, people lived generation after generation. They built the walls into various shapes and painted them with bizarre and beautiful colors. Relying on the protection of the walls, they resisted a series of stormy days in the distant years, from ancestors to young children.

Like a spark on the prairie, whether in the misty morning or the dark dusk, walls were secretly, densely built for millions of people on this boundless wilderness. One wall surrounded another, one row connected to another, like long castles, like continuous mountain peaks...

From that time on, the prairie was no longer as lonely as a desert. Countless people, for their own selfish desires, raised millions of arms in every corner of the earth, building walls, and then energetically repairing them next to the rubble for its collapse. The coarse voice roared like a wild horse! The exchange of sweat, the gathering of strength, towns were built by people, and the towering walls of cities also appeared. On every side of the wall, along the cracks, there was boiling noise, greedy laughter, absurd delirium, the barking of wolves and dogs, and somber groans...

Perhaps human intelligence is precisely foolishness. What is often exchanged for the joyful desire is tragic despair! When the first solid wall like a mountain cliff stood on the soil, the inventor may have been excited to the point of trembling. A hideous-like smile was affixed at the corner of the mouth. This was a success in conquering nature, and the people of the earth would follow his masterpiece in every corner of the earth. They would universally build walls. Their heads would no longer be battered by wind and rain, and their bodies would no longer be cold. From then on, they could have a place of rest.

But the inventor did not expect that humans, having walls, would be cut off from everything like impregnable trenches. Those who imitated the building of walls did not even think that in order to find warmth, they were building fences around themselves, disliking the old life and fearing the blowing of wind and rain, but as a result lived more miserably. People were separated from each other. The walls cut them open and locked them tightly, like countless prisoners, people had no freedom!

Walls cruelly separated everything, tearing apart the friendship between people...

Humans are ultimately selfish. Among them, in order to seek their own happiness from the side of the wall, they constantly rehearsed ghostly skills and struggles. They repeatedly exposed the primitive bestiality, forgetting that they were all of the same kind, forgetting "humanity"!

With the evolution of the times, the walls increased year by year, blocking people's eyes, becoming a dark, vast expanse.

Just like that, since some unknown time until now, the walls have relentlessly shrouded people with a thick sorrow, like the fog of high mountains that forever congeals there.

But no one, like a human, bravely conducts a "trial", raising his fist to attack any wall!...

### Air Disaster: Re-examining the Three Plane Accidents

When we read the reports about the three passenger planes from the two Chinese Central Companies that encountered accidents on the same day, we felt both grief and indignation! We grieved over the tragedy of the disaster; and we were indignant. Why couldn't the blind landing equipment at Jiangwan Airport establish contact? And why didn't Tan Hwa Airport have this kind of equipment?

The two airplanes of the China National Aviation Corporation circled over Shanghai for three hours and thirty minutes. Please, readers, close your eyes and imagine what kind of psychological state the people in the plane were in at that time. Who doesn't seek to live? This life-or-death struggle, can there be anything more tragic in the world? And the Central Aviation Corporation's plane, forced to land and crash in Jiangwan Zhangjiazhai, was similarly forced to the final juncture, forced to do so.

We know that the airports of the China and Central Aviation Companies are in Longhua, and the reason why the planes flocked to Jiangwan was because there was blind landing equipment there. However, that was a military airport, and it was managed by the US military. The lack of usual contact was to be expected, and this time, the planes successively sought help from Jiangwan Airport, but only one of the China planes escaped danger. Whether there are other circumstances in this deserves our exploration. Since Longhua is the main airport of the two companies, why doesn't it have this equipment? Here, we cannot help but feel indignant for the victims!

What is gone is gone, what is to come can be pursued. We now have reason and even the right to request that the airline companies strengthen their equipment and must achieve 100% safety, otherwise, if the Chinese people's long-held idea that "flying is dangerous" is not broken, it will only become heavier, and the future of China's aviation industry is truly unimaginable.

### Last Year, This Year, Next Year

— Zheng Fan

Like Chickens and Dogs in Turmoil

It is said that last year was the Year of the Rooster. The rooster crows at dawn, so the sky brightened, and everyone was happy. However, this year is the Year of the Dog. When the Year of the Rooster and the Year of the Dog are linked together, it becomes "like chickens and dogs in turmoil." Therefore, "requisitioning" is in the front, "malfeasance" is in the back, bullets fly, and prices jump wildly, a complete mess, dark and chaotic. What about next year? We shall wait and see!

A Comparison with Last Year

At the end of last year, the price of gold was 80,000 yuan, and the price of US dollars was 1,400 yuan. In one year, the price increased by more than four times but less than five times.

At the end of last year, the price of rice was 7,000 yuan, and at the end of this year, the price of rice is 70,000 yuan, an increase of ten times!

At the end of last year, when taking the tram, regardless of the length of the route or the class (first, second, or third), the fare was a uniform 5 yuan in legal tender. Now, the highest fare has reached 400 yuan, an increase of eighty times!

The price of a Smart shirt at the end of last year could buy a dozen; however, the money used to buy a Smart shirt last year can only buy a towel today.

The Popularity of US Dollars

At this time last year, there were many types of banknotes: legal tender, "Central Reserve Notes," and gold certificates. Counting the banknotes was not easy. This year, wealthy people are not interested in this; their minds have already turned to "US dollars"!

The Price of Brains Has Increased

A haircut costs 3,000 yuan in legal tender. Last year, this amount was equivalent to 600,000 yuan in "Central Reserve Notes," which had been forcibly exchanged for 1.2 million yuan in legal tender. So, doesn't that mean a haircut now costs a total of 1.2 million yuan in legal tender?

### Starting Over

— Hong Guo

Seeing off the old and welcoming the new is a long story, but to put it directly: The Republic of China, starting from the 36th year (1947), should start everything anew!

This applies to the nation and society alike!

### Tax

— Qian

In Chinese and foreign history, we can find many unheard-of tax names. Now, let's list a few to join in the fun in this "world of taxes."

"Beard Tax": This is a great deed of Peter the Great of Russia. Due to his aversion, he stipulated that anyone who did not cut their beard had to pay a tax. It was not abolished until the time of Empress Catherine.

"Piano Tax": Italy once levied this tax. Each piano was subject to a tax of 50 lire. There was also a billiards tax, with the highest amount exceeding 250 lire.

"Hearth Tax": England levied a hearth tax between 1662 and 1689, charging two shillings per hearth.

"Window Tax": England levied a window tax between 1698 and 1851. Tax collectors would pass by the door of each house and count the number of windows to determine the tax payable.

"Funeral Tax": Practiced in Romania, the highest amount was 3,000 yuan.

"Title Tax": Spain's "Good Tax" was levied specifically on people with titles. A nobleman had to pay thousands of yuan in tax each year.

"Head Tax": Prevalent in Southeast Asia, mostly levied by colonial authorities on indigenous people, and overseas Chinese were also not exempt.

### The Organization of Beggars 21 Performing Arts Begging (Part 2)

— Huang Jiatan

(Thirteen) "Opening the Great Gate" - Among the cruelest tricks of the beggar gang to solicit alms, the "Opening the Great Gate" gang is the most brutal. All the dangerous acts of drawing blood by cutting the skin are classified into this category. This gang is further divided into three factions: "Red Bar," "Mine Sit," and "Needle Piercing." "Red Bar" involves inserting a barber's razor into the forehead, penetrating the flesh by about an inch. Fresh pig's blood is applied to make it look naturally ferocious and terrifying. "Mine Sit" involves knocking on the stone floor, hitting the forehead until it breaks and bleeds, shocking passersby and inducing them to give money. "Needle Piercing" involves inserting a long steel needle into the arm to show people. This type of "Opening the Great Gate" beggar believes that Lord Guan (Guan Yu) is their ancestor. This is probably because Guan Gong could ask Hua Tuo to cut his arm to heal his wound without changing his expression, which is enough to command respect. Therefore, every time they go out, they must first burn incense at the Guan Emperor Temple, which the gang calls "Worshipping the Master."

(Fourteen) "Fast and Slow Run" - Those low-level beggars who have no skills to sell have no choice but to beg from door to door, begging with a miserable expression. They are the lowest level of the beggar gang. Their behavior is divided into two types: "Fast Walk" and "Slow Walk." The "Fast Walk" gang comes to the door, limited to saying "Begging for something." If the shopkeeper gives them money, they take it and leave. If they don't give it, they run away to the next house. This gang adopts the principle of "every inch of time is precious" and never wastes time. The "Slow Walk" gang stands firmly in front of the shop door like a dull bird. They will never leave unless they are given money to send them away. When shopkeepers encounter this type of "long-term resistance," if they stubbornly refuse to give money, the beggar will stand still forever. If they are given money after a long time, they must give more. Because the beggar believes that the time wasted must be compensated by the shopkeeper.

(Fifteen) "Fake Childbirth" - In the beggar gang, in addition to the male beggars' efforts to get money, the female beggars in their families are not willing to sit idle. Whenever there is an opportunity, they launch an offensive on the streets. The most common is to perform a live drama of giving birth on the street. Before the performance, the beggar woman must first smear pig's blood on the straw and clothes and lie down outside the alleyway door in the early morning, holding a bloody newborn baby in her arms, immediately attracting passersby nearby. The beggar woman pretends to be a newly delivered mother with moans. At this time, the nearby ladies come to hear the news, and everyone is moved by sympathy and donates money. People in the gang call it "Crossing Blood." However, to perform this live drama, a fresh, live child is needed, a real baby who has just been born. It can be performed continuously three or several times in different locations. After three or four days after giving birth, the flaws will be seen by people, and it cannot be done anymore.

(Sixteen) "Fake Monks" - Beggars pretend to be monks, wearing monk robes, carrying Bodhisattvas, and soliciting incense money from door to door. This type of imposter is the most burdensome to the Buddhist community. However, the devout old ladies who generally believe in Buddhism are eager to donate and do not want to investigate their origins. Isn't this what is meant by hiding evil and encouraging theft?

(Seventeen) "Hands as Feet" - Disabled beggars whose feet are not good at walking have no choice but to use their hands as feet, holding two local pads in their hands to walk and beg. However, there are few genuine ones and many imposters. It is really a mixture of reality and falsehood, and there is no way to investigate!

(Eighteen) "Walking Double Knocks" - Beggars beat drums along the way to beg, hitting the drum with three sticks, imitating the flower drum tune, or singing the Shunliu Taoist tune. The end of the lunar year and the beginning of the new year are especially auspicious days for this type of activity. There are many ways to beg, but they do not deviate from the old practice of hitting the drum with three sticks. The Tai Gang is the rear guard of the eighteen classical dramas.

### Look How Innocent and Happy the Children Are!

### San Mao

### Also Talking About Polyphonic Characters

— Hui

The need to reform square Chinese characters is beyond dispute. The question is how to reform, that is, what kind of new style of writing to use as a substitute. In the past half-century, we have seen our predecessors exhaust all kinds of methods, including imitating Japanese "kana," phonetic characters, simplified characters, basic Chinese characters, phonetic symbols, National Romanization, Latinized New Writing, ... up to recently when someone used polyphonic characters like "　". But I believe that all attempts to preserve the square shape of square characters, no matter how the plan is, will inevitably fail in the end.

If the above premise is correct, then today's rehash of creating polyphonic characters is not an "attempt" but a reproduction of failure and a waste of energy.

Perhaps some people will counter-argue with Zao Dingyou's creation of the "囗" shape with a "書" character inside, not missing a single stroke, as a polyphonic character for "library." But I would also like to present evidence that more than ten years ago, when Mr. Du published a booklet soliciting opinions from all parties on combining the three characters "圖書館" into one character, this booklet also advocated that words such as "博牧院" (museum) and "美術館" (art gallery) should also create "polyphonic characters," just like reducing "圖書館" into one "書" character placed in a "four-sided" frame.

This proposal was put forward, but for more than ten years, I have never seen a second "polyphonic character" in a second place.

On the contrary, I only remember that the entrance of the National Sun Yat-sen University Library, where Mr. Du was the director, still used the three characters "圖書館." Someone also proposed that names with two or three characters might as well be combined into a single square character, but in the books published by Du Dingyou in the past two years, he still wrote "杜定友" three characters neatly, without missing a stroke.

Oracle bone script, bronze inscriptions, Wei stele inscriptions, ... you can write them into scrolls and enjoy them alone in the room; but proposing to use oracle bone script to publish daily newspapers is nothing short of madness.

You can freely call a circle containing a triangle any kind of brand as a trademark, and no one has the right to interfere. But you must find a way to match this graphic pattern with a pronunciation, and use it as a single character to represent "an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle" in a plane geometry book, which is a thankless task. Such things can be used as a kind of advertising method, but truly thinking of it as a method of reforming Chinese characters is a bit too much.

Just think: "Gold Does Not Exchange," "Purple Chicken Wolf Hair," "White Whole Hair," "Small Red Tip"... if each of these thousands of types of writing brushes were to "equally" start with a "compound character," what kind of world would it be! How much space would the typesetting plate increase!

Evolving from pictographic characters to phonetic writing is an irresistible trend. Although phonetic symbols have been "crawling like a turtle" (Li Jinxi's words) for more than twenty years, don't be afraid; even if National Romanization has not been widely promoted to this day, there is no need to be discouraged. "Time" will definitely help Chinese characters develop in this direction.

The "Latinized New Writing" movement seven to ten years ago was, in principle, not much different from the simple National Romanization that my father taught me when I was a student. However, since the beginning of the "New Writing Movement," some people have used it as a tool for political struggle, so it was misunderstood by the authorities as being more harmful than "floods and fierce beasts." If that kind of simple phonetic writing had not merged with another political movement, as long as it was allowed to develop naturally, I think: today no one would regard "building a house on top of a bed" as a way to reform Chinese characters.

Even if it is a "road," I am afraid it is a "dead end"!

Weekend Teatime
— Liu Sui

Blessing the New Year

Today is the last weekend of this year. Having experienced fifty-two weekends over the past year, we seem to have crossed a long and difficult rapid. Before leaving these remaining pages of the years that we have trampled on, there are really too many feelings: the country is not peaceful, people's livelihood is like thorns, the "collapse wind" is everywhere, and the "rising wind" is raging; the requisitioning and investigation are just like a river of spring water, which has already flowed eastward, and the distribution of materials can be considered as sending charcoal in the snow, but it has not given us the warmth we expected. Past events are like smoke, and these fragmented regrets will all become relics. The Bible says: "Let the ugly sins go away! Light is about to come." On Christmas Day, we silently recite this chapter, and there are endless fantasies in our hearts. As the saying goes, "It is no use regretting the past; the future can be pursued." In fact, I have already argued too much about the past, but it seems that this has not had any significant effect. In addition to resentment, we can only sincerely pray for the rebirth of the future, truly filling everyone's emptiness and regrets in the past year!

A Slight Explanation of the "Collapse Wind"

There is "collapsing foot" in rotating credit associations, "collapsing accounts" in lending, and there is a lot of talk about "collapsing" in the market, and it seems that there is also something brewing politically; a collapse sound, in the current situation of frequent urging of the lunar drum, a person with a little neurasthenia feels overwhelmed by the feeling of "how to end the year." However, this is only limited to patients with neurasthenia who have this feeling, and those who are a little more normal and have deep calculations can turn a blind eye to it. You see: despite the threat of "collapsing feet" and "collapsing accounts," rotating credit associations and high-interest loans are rising and thriving; although there are cries of "closing down sale" and "clearing out inventory at low prices" on the road, the Christmas dinners over 100,000 yuan are still sold out two days in advance, and Christmas cakes costing 280,000 yuan are also snapped up to be used as decorations for revelry; although many people with neurasthenia in Beijing, Shanghai and other places are gathering and sending telegrams to "overthrow something," those who are being overthrown seem to be making new offerings and turning a deaf ear; Zhuangzi said: "Splendor is bland," and the saying goes: "There is nothing in the world, but mediocre people disturb themselves." Mediocre people are probably the most tragic characters in the world!

Prohibition of Night Dances

Christmas, New Year, a string of good times and festivals, people in the city of course want to "dance to the music," as if only "dancing" can express their celebration. However, good things come with twists and turns: Shanghai is to ban night dances after twelve o'clock, Hangzhou is only allowed to embellish it in the form of social dances, and it is said that Chongqing and Kunming and other places seem to ban it but not ban it; in short, dancing is not like smoking opium, in order to maintain morality and security, "banning" should be occasionally banned, but the general principles of "noble entertainment" and "consideration for business difficulties" are always taken into account. Therefore, new dancers are no longer allowed in after twelve o'clock, and people inside can still dance as usual; a few lookouts are set up at the door, and the social dances inside can still be danced with dance partners. The ban on dancing is like this, it doesn't matter much, I hope that the large-scale ban on opium and drugs starting from January next year must be swift and severe!

Goodbye "Year of the Dog"

The major corruption in the collection of land taxes in Jiangyin, the embezzlement of accounts and goods by the social section chief of Yuhuan, and the demands of celebrities in Suzhou are coming one after another, forming the last few disreputable public cases of this year. The new era is approaching, and the climax of corruption incidents in the past year does not seem to have come to an end. Frankly speaking, prices have been high in recent years, so of course the yellow filth is more wonderful near the end of the year, so we really should not make any false accusations against prominent officials and celebrities. This year is the Year of the Dog, and although the dog's nature is loyal, when it is anxious, it will jump over the wall, so it is inevitable that there will be many unexpected things; next year is the Year of the Pig, and although the pig is dull, it can be content and know its fate, and even if it has love in its belly, it probably won't often drill out of its doghouse like a dog to steal and touch things; the end of the year and the beginning of the year are the time to switch fortunes, and when the pig's luck comes to the celebrities next year, everyone will be sitting at home, engaging in establishing virtue and words, and no longer showing their faces, there are not many days left this year, and it is no wonder that corruption and eating filth incidents will perform a final climax before parting!
