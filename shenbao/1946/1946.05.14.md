### Representatives of Various Parties to Arrive in Beijing Within Days; Preparations for the Resumption of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Subgroup Meetings; Marshall and Zhou Enlai to Meet Again

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to Shao Lizi, among the three meetings that may be convened soon, the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting is scheduled to be held after the arrival in Beijing of the CCP representatives left in Chongqing, such as Bi Wu, as well as representatives of the Democratic League and the Youth Party. The CCP representatives Dong Biwu and He Sijing, originally scheduled to arrive in Beijing today, have changed their flight to the 14th due to inclement weather. The Democratic League representative Luo Longji has arrived in Chongqing from Kunming and is scheduled to arrive in Beijing before the 20th. In addition, it is rumored that representatives of various parties remaining in Shanghai who will attend the Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting will also arrive in Beijing within the week. Judging from the recent actions of representatives of various parties, even if the Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting is held, it will likely be next week. The previous suggestion that the Second Plenary Session of the Political Consultative Conference would be convened seems to be no longer necessary at present. Zhou Enlai met with Marshall at 3:00 PM on the 13th and spoke for an hour. It is said that the content of the talks included not only the Northeast issue but also the situation of the KMT and CCP armies in central Hubei, northern China, and northern Jiangsu. After Zhou departed, according to sources close to Marshall, Marshall has listened to the opinions of both the government and the CCP since arriving in Beijing. When necessary, he may consider taking the opportunity to listen to the opinions of the Chinese people, as listening to multiple perspectives is not only beneficial for reference but also extremely helpful for negotiations on Chinese unity and unification. It is said that Zhou Enlai is scheduled to meet with Marshall again at 3:00 PM on the 14th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] General Marshall held talks with Chairman Chiang and discussed matters with Yu Dawei daily. Yu, proficient in English, acts as an intermediary for Chairman Chiang. General Zhang Qun, one of the representatives of the "Peace Talks" on internal affairs, arrived in Beijing today to meet with General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army.

[Another Dispatch] Xinmin Daily quoted reliable sources as saying: KMT-CCP negotiations will resume soon, but there is no need to convene a second session of the Political Consultative Conference, as the unresolved government reorganization, draft constitution, and military issues will be discussed by the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup, the Constitution Review Subgroup, and the Military Three-Man Group. Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Bedell Smith met this morning. [Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] A newspaper reported: The ten-member Comprehensive Subgroup Committee of the Political Consultative Conference will be convened by Shao Lizi on May 20th at the Nanjing National Assembly Hall. Two representatives from each of the government, the Communist Party, the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and independent factions will participate. In addition, the Constitution Review Committee will also reopen soon to continue discussions. The committee has a total of thirty-five members, including five representatives from each of the five parties and ten experts.

### US Government Economic Aid to China; Marshall Has Veto Power Over Loan Rumors

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Although the current pressing political and military problems in China are fraught with difficulties, there is still strong hope for a solution. Various rumors outside suggest that the situation in the Northeast is deadlocked and a large-scale civil war is imminent. This ignores the facts and is unaware of the Chinese habit of bargaining. The so-called facts include the following two points:

(1) The KMT and CCP armies have been sworn enemies for eighteen years. Since the ceasefire order was implemented on January 13, the two sides have been confronting each other in various places, separated by only an arrow's distance. Apart from unavoidable minor conflicts, they have not yet crossed the original defense line to an irrecoverable situation.

(2) Both the KMT and CCP are willing to continue political consultations, which shows that the door to negotiations has not been closed, and a compromise solution can be reached at any time. Marshall has a very clear and fair grasp of the Chinese situation. In addition, both the KMT and CCP recognize that world opinion expects peace and democracy in China and is becoming impatient. When this reporter left Yan'an, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong told me that although the current situation is not as good as it was when the ceasefire agreement, the military reorganization plan, and the PCC agreement were concluded in January, he and the CCP remain optimistic. Mao also said that setbacks are inevitable, but democracy and unification are imperative. World trends and world opinion, with the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom as examples, must make this happen.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] News here today: President Truman's special envoy, Marshall, has absolute veto power over the $500 million loan to China. This is the most powerful authority that the US President has given to a special envoy, so that he can implement the US policy abroad. According to diplomatic authorities, President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes are planning to use American gold to achieve American goals, and China is a clear example. When Special Envoy Marshall was ordered to go to China in December last year, President Truman announced that US economic assistance to China depended on the degree of internal stability in China. In March of this year, Marshall returned home to report on his work and held several meetings with Truman. China once applied for a total of 2 billion yuan in cash loans and credit loans. At that time, negotiations between the National Government and the United States were expected to obtain 500 million yuan, but it was heard that Marshall intended to use this to win over the National Government and the CCP to strengthen China's strength. This loan had already been prepared by the Export-Import Bank, ready to be paid, but was suddenly suspended and all powers to handle the loan and all other Sino-US relations were given to Marshall to act expediently. During Marshall's return to the country, the military reorganization plan he proposed to stop the conflict between the KMT and the CCP and gradually merge the two armies was broken due to the Northeast issue. Marshall's return to China this time is to address how to restore his mediation mission after the setback. The only effective weapon is to control the US loan. As for the US troops stationed in China, they have now been reduced to about 30,000, only responsible for guarding.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The Military Mediation Department held a military reorganization meeting on the morning of the 13th to discuss military reorganization agencies and their use, but it awaits a decision by the Chiefs of Staff meeting. According to those involved, before the overall situation is determined, concrete progress in military reorganization cannot be expected. In the afternoon, there was a Chiefs of Staff meeting to discuss the Communist army's occupation of Fengjiakou and Botou. The Communist side said that this was a pursuit by the Communist army to avenge the annihilation of 100 of their friendly troops. As a result, the Botou team was first ordered to investigate the process, and then it was decided whether the Communist army would withdraw. [Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Regarding the CCP's expression to revise the military reorganization plan, the CCP personnel in the Executive Headquarters here also expressed their views today, saying that the situation has changed, and the original plan should be revised. They also said that the CCP has informed the government and the US that the ratio of three to one for military reorganization in the Northeast is no longer applicable.

### National Assembly Preparatory Meeting Adjourns; Organization of the Executive Committee Established; Expressing Consistent Initial Intention to Study the Draft Constitution

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Adjournment speech of the National Assembly Preparatory Meeting: Representatives of the National Assembly are elected by the people and bear the important responsibility of drafting the constitution. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, ten years have passed without a meeting. We are awed by our responsibilities, so we organized the National Representatives Friendship Association in the provisional capital, Chongqing. When the government accepted the public's opinion and all parties negotiated and unanimously decided to convene the meeting on May 5 this year, we went to the capital in response to the call, but the government's order to postpone it suddenly came. Our Association, adhering to its consistent initial intention of promoting constitutional government, held a preparatory meeting on May 1, holding a total of thirteen meetings. Although the time was short, much has been gained, and it was decided to organize a Constitution Draft Research Association. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government had a discussion with all the representatives of our Association on the 7th of this month. We expressed our consistent initial intention, stating that the National Assembly should be convened as soon as possible, the constitution should be drafted as soon as possible, and the government should have its limits on the tolerance of those who obstruct constitutional government. Chairman Chiang delivered a speech on the spot, expressing his concern for the overall situation and his sincere intentions. The representatives all expressed their admiration. What we, all of us, want to tell our compatriots across the country is that the government is determined to implement constitutional government and sincerely hopes to reconvene the National Assembly and enact the constitution as soon as possible. The postponement this time is indeed for the country and the people, and there are unavoidable reasons. However, we representatives feel even more that if a just and constitutional government cannot be promoted, it will be easy for a few party members to hold sway. In the future, if we want to urge the reopening of the Assembly and the enactment of the law, we must gather public opinion and promote civil rights. The Preparatory Meeting should still be based on the regulations and will not be closed until the Assembly convenes. The Preparatory Meeting has been held twelve times. In the future, the main task is not in the meeting, but in the work. Therefore, during the adjournment period, the Executive Committee of this meeting will be responsible. The National Representatives Friendship Association has organizations in various places. During the adjournment period, we will still study the draft constitution in the capital with the greatest determination. The Friendship Association will still promote this matter from the beginning, as it has done for the past two years. We dare to express our sincerity to the people of the country.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The National Assembly Preparatory Meeting held its twelfth meeting on the morning of the 13th, chaired by Xiang Ju Tan, to discuss the draft articles of association for the organization of the Executive Committee after the adjournment of the meeting. After careful study and revision, it was passed. The members of the committee are at least one person per unit, two persons for more than ten persons, three persons for more than twenty persons, and so on. The Executive Committee will regularly attend the meeting during the adjournment period of the Preparatory Meeting to handle all meeting affairs, and is divided into seven groups: General Affairs, Documents, Finance, Investigation, Public Relations, Research, and Propaganda. Meetings will be held once a week. Then, the chairman announced that the meeting would be adjourned on the morning of the 14th, and each unit would elect the executive officers of each unit on the 13th and submit them to the Assembly on the 14th for legal establishment.

### Personnel Left in Beiping for Northeast Reception; Ordered to Depart for Shenyang Again; The Situation in the Northeast May Have New Developments

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The personnel left in Beiping for the Northeast reception have now been ordered to go to Shenyang again to prepare for military reception. Generally, it is judged that there may be new developments in the Northeast situation recently. Here, the personnel of the Jilin Provincial Government have been scheduled to go to Pan on tomorrow (the 14th). Chairman Zheng Daoru, who has been ill in Beiping for a long time, is also scheduled to go on the 16th.

[United Press, Beiping, 13th] According to Communist Northeast news, the Communist army in Sipingjie and Benxi is still resisting. The battle in Sipingjie has been going on for 23 days and is still defended by the Communist army. The National Army attacking Sipingjie has seven divisions, with a firepower of 1,800 rounds per hour. It is said that the National Army can see the city, but cannot break in.

[United Press, Moscow, 13th] TASS News Agency reported from Dalian that on the 1st and 2nd of this month, 2,000 US Marines landed on Huludao, aiming to accelerate the National Army's entry into the Northeast by US ships. The plan is obviously to take the National Army from Qingdao to Huludao by sea, and then go to Shenyang by land. The troops are trained and equipped by the US, and carry artillery, mortars, and tanks.

[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 13th] Liu Bocheng's troops in the Taihang Military Region of the Communist Army, numbering more than 50,000, have recently concentrated in the Gaoyi area, preparing to go to the Northeast.

### Regulations on Adjusting Salaries and Allowances for Civil Servants; Proposer Explains Reasons; To Ensure Peaceful Service to the Government, a Way to Solve the Problem Should Be Found

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] After the "Regulations on Adjusting Salaries and Allowances for Civil Servants and Teachers" passed at the previous meeting of the Legislative Yuan were published, civil servants and teachers were very concerned and inquired about the process and content of the proposal. The proposal was drafted by legislator Jian Bi San and others, and submitted by Lou Tong Sun, Chen Gu Yuan, Zou Shan Qun, Chen Hai Cheng, Hu Xuan Ming, and 33 others. After the General Assembly passed the principles, the President of the Yuan appointed Jian Bi San, Chen Xiao Cen, and Li Qing to supplement the proposal based on the opinions expressed by the members, and then submitted it to the National Defense Supreme Committee for speedy approval and implementation. The reasons and methods of the proposal are summarized below: Reasons: Since the War of Resistance, the lives of civil servants and teachers have been increasingly strained due to the endless rise in prices, to the point where they can hardly maintain themselves. During the War of Resistance, with the enemy in front, victory came first, and civil servants and teachers, while enduring hardships, still worked hard to the end without fear or complaint. Now that victory has arrived, and the rivers and mountains are restored, the lives of civil servants and teachers are even worse than during the war. The past is reminiscent of the present, which is disturbing. Civil servants and teachers buy their knowledge and energy to serve the country, and the government should maintain their appropriate standard of living so that they can serve with peace of mind. After the return to the capital, the great cause of national construction requires civil servants and teachers to work harder. If the government properly finds a way to solve the problem of their livelihood at this time, it will be of great benefit to administrative efficiency and the future of education. We are aware of this and dare not remain silent. We hereby propose the following methods for adjusting the salaries and allowances of civil servants and teachers, and request that they be forwarded to the National Defense Supreme Committee for speedy approval and implementation.

Methods: (1) The multiple of the increase in salaries should be calculated at least according to 1,000 times before the war.

"Explanation": Now the monthly wages of male and female workers are more than 3,000 to 10,000 times before the war. The salaries of civil servants and teachers should be calculated at least 3,000 times one-third of the minimum wage of workers (that is, 1,000 times) to show fairness.

(2) The monthly living allowance should be at least 200,000 yuan.

"Explanation": The living allowance was originally intended to subsidize clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Now the prices of rice, grain, fuel, cloth, and rent have risen to more than 5,000 to 10,000 times before the war. For a family of three or five, according to the current price situation, it will cost at least 200,000 yuan per month just for the most basic eating and housing.

(3) A proper way should be found to distribute goods in kind so that civil servants and teachers can truly benefit.

"Explanation": The distribution of goods in kind during the war did have the effect of supporting the long-term war of resistance, but the various procedures for collection, transportation, and distribution required too much time, people, and money, which was not economical for both the public and private sectors, and was prone to abuse, which seemed to be inconsistent with the government's original intention of distributing food. If the government distributes goods in kind again, it should find a proper way based on past gains and losses so that civil servants and teachers can truly benefit. Before a proper way is determined, at least 200,000 yuan should be issued per month for them to purchase rice and fuel on their own.

(4) The above two methods should be implemented from March 35. "Explanation": The methods for adjusting the salaries and allowances of civil servants and teachers in March of this year were lower than in February. The Central News Agency accurately analyzed this based on facts and published it in newspapers across the country, and civil servants and teachers expressed their sympathy. Moreover, since March, prices have risen sharply every day, and civil servants and teachers have been unable to make ends meet. Therefore, this proposal should be implemented from March to live up to expectations.

### The President of the Yuan Returned to Beijing from Shanghai Yesterday; To Preside Over the Executive Yuan Meeting; Personnel Changes May Be Announced Today or Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The changes in the heads of the three municipalities and two provinces, and the personnel changes of partial reorganization, will be decided separately at the Executive Yuan meeting and the joint meeting of the National Defense Supreme Committee and the Central Standing Committee on the 13th and 14th. It is heard that Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun may be transferred to be the chairman of a certain province, but whether it will be announced at the same time on the day after tomorrow is still undecided. Also, Chairman Wang Maogong of the Jiangsu Provincial Government came to Su yesterday to report on his work, and Chairman Li Pinxian of Anhui is also planning to come to Beijing in the near future.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan flew back to Beijing from Shanghai at 9:00 AM today.

[Central News Agency, This City] Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by his wife Zhang Leyi and his adopted son Zi An, flew to Beijing from Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, and will attend the Executive Yuan meeting today. Among those who accompanied him were Zhu Guangmu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Jiang Jiping, and Yin Zhongrong. At the end of the meeting, a draft of the adjournment declaration of the General Assembly was read, and all members unanimously passed it. In addition, because the Chongqing Shishi Xinbao published an editorial condemning the National Assembly representatives, the content was subjective in terms of wording, which caused fierce debate among all the representatives.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang held a meeting in his department at 3:00 PM on the 13th to generally receive the trade union representatives attending the National Assembly, with 24 people attending. The representatives all expressed their opinions on the organization of trade unions and the future of industry. The problems were all in line with the needs of the country and were very pertinent. At the end, Minister Gu gave a comprehensive answer and expressed his willingness to work with everyone to implement various regulations quickly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] I just met Mr. Chen Texiang, a representative of the people of the country, who arrived in Beijing from Shantou. According to him, there is a grain shortage in Shantou. Before the war, 10,000 bags of rice were imported every day. Currently, this source is completely cut off because Shanghai rice is prohibited from being exported. The current price of rice has reached 130,000 yuan per stone. According to Chen, the most imported material in the Shantou market is remittances from overseas Chinese, about 50 million to 100 million per month, all of which are remitted by overseas Chinese. The population of Shantou is seventeen or eight, especially

### Zhang Daofan and Gu Weijun Both Deny Taking New Positions

[This Newspaper] This newspaper's reporter immediately asked Chairman Zhang Daofan, who was in Shanghai, whether he would take the position of Nanjing Mayor. Zhang said: Please make a "100% denial" on my behalf. He claimed to be a cultured person, accustomed to a free and unfettered life, and expressed his lack of interest in restrictive positions such as mayor. However, when a reporter asked what he would do if the government insisted on making it difficult for him, Zhang said: "I will have to consider it before making a decision."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United Kingdom, he still intends to be an envoy abroad, and the rumor in Beijing and Shanghai that he will take the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs is not true. Regarding the issue of recovering Hong Kong, Gu said that it is only a matter of time. It is heard that Gu still intends to go to Shanghai in the near future, and also intends to go to Beiping within the month.

### Confiscation of Traitor Chen Gongbo's Property; Jiangsu High Court Requests Execution; Traitor Lin Baisheng Indicted by Beijing High Court

[Our Suzhou Office, 13th] Chen Gongbo, the traitor, was previously sentenced to death by the Jiangsu High Court, and it was also decreed that all his property be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. Although his wife, Li Lizhuang, is currently applying for a retrial regarding the death sentence, the judgment to confiscate the remaining property must be enforced. The Jiangsu High Procuratorate sent a memorandum on the 13th to the Capital and Guangdong High Procuratorates, requesting that it be sealed off. [Our Nanjing Office, 13th] Indictment by the Prosecutor of the Capital High Court: Defendant Lin Baisheng, male, 45 years old, from Xinyi County, Guangdong Province, resident of No. 73 Shanghai Road, Nanjing, bogus Governor of Anhui Province, currently in custody. (1) Facts of the crime: In December of the 27th year, the traitor Wang's notorious telegram from Hanoi was released by Baisheng in the South China Daily. On January 17th of the 28th year, he was attacked, and later secretly went to Shanghai to participate in the bogus Sixth National Congress, and served as a bogus Central Executive Committee member, negotiating a "Peace Foundation Plan" with the enemy and serving as a bogus Minister of Propaganda. In the 31st year, he also concurrently served as the bogus Secretary-General of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, the bogus Director-General of the Youth Corps, and the Secretary-General of the Model Corps. On January 9th of the 32nd year, as a member of the entourage, he concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese invaders. In the spring of the 34th year, he was transferred to serve as the bogus Governor of Anhui Province and the bogus Pacification Director of Bengbu. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, he fled to Japan out of fear of punishment and was later detained and sent back to China. (2) Evidence and legal articles violated: He confessed to all of the above positions without hesitation. His confessions are completely consistent with the confessions of his accomplices, Mei Siping and Li Shengwu, in other cases. During his tenure as the bogus Minister of Propaganda, he repeatedly published articles and broadcasts arguing that resistance would inevitably fail (all found in the pasted newspaper clippings). In his book "From September 1st Remembering September 9th," he did his utmost to slander and smear the supreme leader's national policy of leading the war of resistance. His actions constitute a crime under Article 2, Section 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. In accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed. Prosecutor: Chen Shengzu. Clerk: Li Zhishen.

[Our Suzhou Office, 13th] After the traitor Chu Minyi was sentenced to death, his legal wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. At 11:00 AM on the 13th, Ms. Chen ordered her daughter, Chu Mengyuan, to come to Suzhou from Beijing and submit a supplementary statement of reasons to the Jiangsu High Court. The content criticized the original judgment as purely a subjective political argument, and finally weighed the sentence with an objective legal argument. It defended the defendant in two points: political argument and legal argument. It briefly stated that the defendant held important positions in the bogus government for several years and had not committed any acts harmful to the people. Even if the crime of collusion with the enemy is established, it should not be rashly concluded that he intended to resist the country. It requested that the original judgment be abolished and a more fair judgment be made. The full text is over four thousand words, entirely in vernacular Chinese, and the arguments are based on no concrete favorable evidence, purely empty sophistry.

### Two Important Agencies Established Within the Ministry of National Defense; Strategic Committee Directly Under the Head of State; He Yingqin Willing to Set an Example for Veteran Generals

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The second memorial week after the return to the capital was held at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 13th, presided over by Chairman Chiang. Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin reported on: (1) the implementation of the twelve tasks undertaken by the Army Headquarters, such as accepting surrender and repatriating prisoners of war; (2) the adjustment process of military agencies; and (3) the real situation of housing allocation in Nanjing. He first described the process of the Army Headquarters presiding over the acceptance of surrender, repatriation of prisoners of war, disbandment of puppet troops, relief of refugees, and restoration of transportation in various war zones, as well as handling party and government matters in the recovered areas. He then stated: After the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, according to the new system, the General Staff Headquarters and the Strategic Advisory Committee will be established. This system aims to simplify and streamline military agencies. The future national defense army should select outstanding young people to enrich cadres at all levels so that they are energetic and efficient. All first-level generals aged 62, second-level generals aged 60, and lieutenant generals aged 56 should retire according to law. Those who have not reached the retirement age and are academically capable and experienced can serve as members of the Strategic Advisory Committee. The committee is one of the agencies of the Ministry of National Defense and is directly under the head of state who commands the three armies. In peacetime, it studies major national defense plans, and in wartime, it serves as a commander. He Yingqin is willing to take the lead in implementing this policy, setting an example for veteran generals and blazing a trail for the national defense army. Finally, He reported on the housing allocation situation in Nanjing, stating briefly: After Nanjing fell, 4,800 houses were destroyed, and only 170 were added. This is the main reason for the housing shortage. After the victory, the Army Headquarters received eight houses, which have now been allocated to various central agencies. After He Yingqin finished his report, he announced the completion of the ceremony.

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] During the central memorial week report on the new system of the Ministry of National Defense, Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin slightly revealed his intention to retire. He said, "In February and April of this year, I twice earnestly expressed to Chairman Chiang that once the Ministry of National Defense is established, I would very much like to retire as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee to serve the future transcendent national defense army." It is heard that the position of Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense has not yet been determined. Because He Yingqin has publicly stated that he will not take this position, and those in the military who are qualified to fill this position are all deferring. However, military sources believe that a decision will be made within the week. As for the report that the Minister of National Defense will be filled by a civilian, it is absolutely not true. The preparations for the relevant military agency reorganization matters are largely complete. The Reorganization Committee will begin working at the Army Headquarters on the 16th. The cadres and staff of the Army Headquarters, except for a portion who have been ordered to transfer to Chongqing, will remain at the Reorganization Committee to work. Only a small number of personnel need to be disbanded and transferred. Since General He Yingqin expressed his willingness to retire as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee to set an example for the national defense army, it is estimated that more than ten generals from various places who have not reached the retirement age have volunteered to resign from their military positions in order to be called upon to join the Strategic Advisory Committee. It is heard that General Cheng Qian, the current Director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, is also among them. It is believed that once the unity is successful and the unification is completed, the lineup of China's national defense army will be even stronger.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin told foreign journalists tonight that he will resign on or before June 1st, and in the future, he will engage in "lighter work" and serve as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee. The other members are war zone commanders and other senior generals who have not reached retirement age. His retirement age is 62. The committee is a small group and may include Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, Yan Xishan, Commander of the Second War Zone, and Cheng Qian, Director of the Hankou Provisional Headquarters. If Yan Xishan serves as a member, he does not need to give up his position as Chairman of Shanxi Province.

### Commander-in-Chief He Reports on the Implementation of Tasks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin reported on the following major points at the National Government Memorial Week:

First, the situation of the Chinese Army Headquarters carrying out its missions after the Japanese surrender. On August 18, 34th year, it received the order of the Supreme Commander, which stipulates twelve articles of the Chinese Army Headquarters' missions. The implementation of each mission is reported separately as follows:

(1) "Under the command of the Chairman, handle all matters related to the surrender of all enemy troops in the China Theater." The China Theater (excluding Cambodia) includes Taiwan, Penghu, and northern Vietnam. The enemy troops totaled thirty-three infantry divisions, one tank division, two air divisions, forty independent brigades, one independent cavalry brigade, nineteen independent garrison units (equivalent to independent brigades), and six naval special base units, totaling 1.3 million people. All had already been disarmed.

(2) "Instruct the implementation of matters by various war zones and armies." Because the enemy's distribution area in the China Theater was very wide and traffic was difficult, in order to quickly disarm the enemy and easily concentrate and manage them, it was divided into sixteen surrender zones, and sixteen surrender officers were assigned to prescribe all surrender procedures. Regarding the surrender of weapons, the remaining prisoners of war, and all military receipts, it was able to complete the task in an orderly and smooth manner.

(3) "According to the will of the Chairman, issue all orders to the supreme commander of the enemy forces in the China Theater." After receiving the order, I followed it, and before September 8, 34th year, before the enemy's Commander-in-Chief Yasuji Okamura signed the surrender, I notified Okamura with a memorandum to prescribe all procedures so that he could make various preparations for the surrender. On September 9th, after Okamura signed the surrender, the headquarters issued Military Order No. 1 to Okamura, stipulating that from 9:00 AM that day, I would completely change my use of orders and instructions to Okamura. All memos before 9:00 AM on the 9th would be treated as orders. All China Headquarters

(excluding the three northeastern provinces) Taiwan, Penghu, and the Japanese army, navy, and air force in northern Vietnam, completely accepted my control and command, and were not subject to any constraints from the Japanese government, and the title of "Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army" of Yasuji Okamura of Japan was cancelled, allowing him to remain in Nanjing, specializing in transmitting and implementing my orders.

(4) "According to the instructions of the Chairman, closely cooperate with the American military personnel in the China Theater to handle the disposition of enemy troops in the areas occupied by the American military and the areas jointly controlled by the Allied forces after they surrendered." Regarding cooperation with the American military, the first task was to airlift troops to Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and ship troops to Taiwan. The second was for the American amphibious forces to land in Qingdao, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao to assist the national army in accepting surrender and repatriating prisoners of war. The third was to repatriate prisoners of war and Japanese nationals in the China Theater (excluding the three northeastern provinces), totaling 2,039,974 people, who were repatriated to Japan from twelve ports. As of May 5th of this year, 1,631,436 people have been repatriated to Japan, and the remaining 408,538 people are being repatriated. It is expected that they can be completely repatriated to Japan before June 30th. . "The matter of refugee relief and the restoration of transportation, communication, and transportation in the recovered area." Refugee relief is handled by the Relief Administration, and I have no right to command it. Regarding the restoration of traffic, communication, and transportation, south of the Longhai Line, all those that required military assistance to be restored have been completed and are now open. However, the eastern section of the Longhai Line (i.e., the Xuzhou-Haizhou section) was cut off again by the Communist army after it was restored and is still not open. As for North China and the Northeast, all places reached by the national army have been restored. Although they have been disturbed and destroyed by the Communist army, and they are sometimes open and sometimes blocked, the traffic within the scope of the national army can still be maintained.

(6) Guiding various war zones and sub-regions to handle the acceptance of the surrender of puppet troops, their disbandment, and the suppression of puppet troops who disobey orders in stages and regions. At the time of surrender, the total number of puppet troops was more than 683,000, all of whom surrendered to the government. As of now, more than 432,000 people have been disbanded. Except for Hao Pengju, the bogus Governor of Huaihai Province, who rebelled and surrendered to the Communist Party after surrendering because he refused to disband his bogus troops, the rest did not disobey orders. (7) Being responsible for quickly disposing of the Nanjing puppet organization government, restoring order in Nanjing and its vicinity, and waiting for the National Government to return to the capital. When I accepted the surrender in Nanjing on September 9th last year, only five companies of the New Sixth Army were transported to Nanjing. At that time, there were 70,000 enemy troops in the urban area, more than 10,000 puppet troops in the city, and the area ten kilometers outside the city was a bandit-infested area. At that time, I rushed to transport troops, disposed of enemy and puppet troops, cleared the remnants of the puppet organization, and drove away bandits. I ordered a large number of Japanese prisoners of war to participate in cleaning the city and building roads. By the time the government returned to the capital on May 5th, this task had been fully accomplished. The security of the capital is now very solid. I can responsibly say that there is absolutely no concern about insecurity near the capital in the future.

(8) "During the period of accepting the surrender of the enemy forces, according to the instructions of the Chairman, mobilize troops to occupy various military, political, economic, and transportation strongholds and key ports in the China Theater to form a favorable posture for collecting enemy weapons." Since receiving the surrender, Guangzhou, Changsha, Wuhan, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Anqing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Qingdao, Jinan, Beiping, Baoding. Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Shanhaiguan, GuiSui, Baotou, Datong, Taiyuan have been quickly occupied, only Gubeikou, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Chifeng. Duolun, due to encountering special obstacles, failed to reach.

(9) "For any surrender forces not designated by the government who accept the surrender of enemy forces without authorization and attempt to disrupt our surrender plan, they may be submitted to the Chairman for punishment." Since the surrender, although the Communist army in various places in North China has repeatedly disobeyed orders and attempted to accept the surrender of a few parts of the enemy army, they have not been able to do so, so I have not submitted to the Chairman to take action.

(10) "Enemy forces that surrender to the troops designated by the Chairman, if they do not implement our military orders, may be ordered by the Army Headquarters to use force to punish them, and the enemy commander or enemy commander who does not obey the orders may be directly dealt with." With the virtue of Chairman Chiang, all Japanese troops strictly followed my orders during the surrender period, and no facts of disobeying orders have occurred.

(11) "Supervise and may handle all party and government affairs in the recovered area." According to this task, the Army Headquarters established a Committee for Receiving Party and Government in Recovered Areas in Zhijiang, which was composed of members from the Headquarters and the Executive Yuan. The method of handling affairs was to collect various books from the enemy and puppet parties, reorganize and analyze them, and then, according to their nature, order Yasuji Okamura and the Japanese military commanders in various places to designate a certain cause to maintain the status quo and hand it over to the receiving personnel sent by our government ministries and departments on a certain day. However, this method was later changed by order and could not be implemented. Therefore, after the Army Headquarters arrived in Nanjing, it only ordered Yasuji Okamura to follow the transfer according to the orders held by the receiving personnel of each receiving personnel to receive which cause.

(12) "Command all troops in each war zone advancing into the recovered area and the original troops in the recovered area, but the troops left behind in each war zone are still under the command of each war zone under the instructions of this committee (Military Affairs Committee)." I respectfully complied, but due to factual needs, I also received an order from the Chairman to place all the land forces in the country except those stationed in Sichuan and Kang under my command. The General Logistics Headquarters and the naval fleet were also temporarily placed under my command until now. The Army Headquarters was originally the highest command organ of the field army during the war. Now that the National Government has returned to the capital, there is no need for the existence of the Army Headquarters, so I have already submitted a request to abolish the Army Headquarters. Second, "The Reorganization of the Central Military Agency." I have served as the Minister of Military Administration for 14 and a half years, the Chief of the General Staff for 8 years, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army for one and a half years. I deeply feel that my central military agency is too large and complicated. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, my supreme commander is determined to establish the most advanced military system, abolish the Military Affairs Committee, and reorganize the Ministry of National Defense. Under the Ministry of National Defense, a General Staff Headquarters is established, on the one hand, to simplify and streamline the central military agency in the future, and on the other hand, to include the Ministry of National Defense in the Executive Yuan, making the Minister of National Defense a member of the cabinet. At the same time, the supreme commander's command power is directly transmitted through the Chief of the General Staff, and the national army, navy, and air force are ordered. This system is very reasonable, and all my military personnel wholeheartedly support it. The important positions of the General Staff Headquarters should also be filled with young military officers. For the placement of some veteran generals, first-level generals should retire at the age of sixty-two, second-level generals should retire at the age of sixty, and lieutenant generals should retire at the age of fifty-six. Those who have not reached the active service age, but have served in important military positions, have excellent academic knowledge, and have outstanding honors, whether they are army, navy, or air force generals, can be selected as members of the Strategic Advisory Committee. This committee is directly under the head of state and studies various issues related to national defense and strategy in peacetime, and serves as senior commanders in wartime.

Third, "Regarding the Nanjing Housing Issue" (omitted).

### UNRRA Far East Committee Meeting to Be Held in Nanjing at the Beginning of Next Month

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] UNRRA Director-General Jiang Tingfu gave a press conference at 3:00 PM on the 13th. Answering reporters' questions, 1. Asked what the results of Hoover's visit to China were? Answer: Hoover is very sympathetic to China and admits that China's transportation capacity is sufficient to transport 200,000 tons of grain to the whole country every month. 2. Asked if there is a shortage of food in the Northeast? Answer: The Northeast lacks the most medicines and clothing, and the food situation is relatively good, but UNRRA is still transporting a considerable amount of food there. 3. Asked what are the transportation tools of UNRRA? Answer: UNRRA has 1,000 ships, including 700 tugs and barges, and 300 small naval boats, all of which are suitable for inland waterway transportation. However, these ships are too small to cross the Pacific Ocean from the United States to China. UNRRA has now signed a contract with an American shipping company to transport these ships to China. The most difficult thing is that China lacks sailors and has no experience in driving these small gasoline-powered ships. 4. Asked about the progress of the levee repair and breach closing project for the Yellow River's return to its old course? Answer: There are now 158,000 people engaged in this work, and UNRRA provides food. According to the CCP report, the old riverbed has been reclaimed. If it returns to its old course, hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. UNRRA has considered providing relief for this. 5. Asked if the location of the next UNRRA Far East Regional Committee meeting has been decided? Answer: It has been decided to be held at the Public Rest Society in our capital on June 7th. UNRRA will send a special plane before the meeting to invite representatives from various countries to inspect the disaster situation in various parts of China.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee meeting is scheduled to be held in our capital on June 7th. This was formally announced by UNRRA Director-General Jiang Tingfu when answering questions from a Central News Agency reporter at the first press conference in Nanjing. It is reported that the meeting place has been scheduled at the Capital International Recreational Society.

Suzhou

Garrisoned Water Police Mutiny and Loot

In Jingshu Town, in the Bianguan District under the county, the first detachment of the second district of the garrisoned water police, consisting of 23 policemen, suddenly mutinied on the evening of the 10th, looting Jingshu Town before fleeing towards Taihu Lake. Yesterday, according to a returning coerced policeman's report, the cause of the mutiny was that two policemen, Xie Zhian and Yao Guoliang, murdered acting detachment commander Guo Wenming because their loan requests were unsuccessful. They seized two light machine guns and, with live ammunition, coerced the remaining 19 policemen to carry weapons and follow them in the robbery. The water police authorities are now strictly arresting all the fugitives to bring them to justice.

Wuxi

Resisting Military Grain Levy Submitted to Province for Instructions

Lu Dingyuan, a big landlord in Dangkou District, Jin'e Township of this county, resisted the military grain levy because he was rich and unkind. During the past enemy-puppet period, he colluded with local hooligans and bandits, extorting from tenant farmers and even using enemy-puppet armed forces to collect rent from the people, causing public outrage among all the Baojia chiefs and local agricultural, commercial, industrial, and academic circles. They twice jointly petitioned the county government to forward the matter to the provincial government for instructions on how to handle it.

National Identity Cards to be Issued; This County's Party, Government, Military, and Group held their 18th meeting on the 11th, chaired by Dang Jingzhao, resolved: (1) Conduct a household registration survey, clarifying the urban area before the 20th and the rural area before the 30th, and then carry out spot checks.

(4) Ban dramas that are detrimental to social morals.

Jiangyin

Military Grain Storage Loses Weight

The county government, following provincial orders, requisitioned 20,000 shi of military grain. Local agencies, considering the people's strength insufficient, reluctantly agreed to 10,000 shi and sent a telegram to the province requesting a reduction or exemption, fearing that it would be difficult to approve. Now, the purchased military grain, when moved into the warehouse, weighs only 90%, causing public uproar and affecting the purchase. County Magistrate Fang sent a special telegram to the province requesting instructions on the handling policy. The Garrisoned National Army in Cheng County Pays Attention to River Defense; Since the headquarters of the 49th Army moved here, it has paid great attention to river defense and public training. In recent days, the political department has sent personnel to various towns to supervise and assist local agencies, adjust the candidates for Baojia and self-government personnel, set up public checkpoint posts, and conduct spot checks on household registrations. The people actively participate, showing the harmony of military-civilian cooperation.

Jiaxing

Regulating the Purchase Price of Spring Cocoons

The silkworm affairs in the four townships of Jiaxing are nearing the major sleep stage. Due to weather conditions, the silkworms are not developing well, causing the silkworm varieties to fade. It is expected that the silkworm harvest will be of medium quality. The cocoon merchants are preparing to collect cocoons, and several factories have been destroyed by the enemy and puppets, making it difficult to repair them in a short time. In addition, several factories are hesitant due to their remote location and the recent frequent bandit alarms. They are currently requesting the authorities to send a team to defend the cocoon market when the time comes. As for the price of fresh cocoons, the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Association has decided that the price of fresh cocoons must not be lower than 100,000 yuan per zu. The cocoon industry association of this county will also convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss everything. Zhejiang Province Approves and Announces the Purchase Price of Spring Cocoons; Because the feeding of spring silkworms in various counties of Zhejiang Province is enthusiastic this year, new cocoons will be available in Xin'an, Shengxian, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang in the coming days. The China Silk Company has decided to allocate a cocoon purchase loan of 10 billion yuan. Southern Anhui, due to limited production, is assigned to the Zhejiang region for handling. In order to expedite the loan disbursement, it has been approved that the Zhejiang China Bank will allocate 2 billion yuan, of which 500 million yuan will first be loaned to Zhuji, Xinchang, Shengxian, and other places on the 10th, and the remaining amount is still being loaned. As for the standard price of spring cocoons, the provincial government has approved and announced it, calculated based on reeling, ranging from 95,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan per 100 market pounds, with the central price being 100,000 yuan. The Municipal Government Forbids the Operation of Dance Halls; The Hangzhou Municipal Government intends to ban the operation of dance halls from the end of May. It is said that the education authorities will also prohibit students from participating in dancing to avoid neglecting their studies. The British Dominions prime ministers held an Imperial Conference in London at the end of last month to discuss Pacific defense issues. In principle, it had been decided to convene a Pacific Nations Conference to establish a defense structure in the South and Southwest Pacific to resist possible aggression. However, because Canadian Prime Minister King arrived late, the Imperial Conference had to adjourn temporarily, waiting for King to arrive in England before reconvening to thoroughly resolve the issue and send Australian Prime Minister Chifley to Washington to discuss the issue of the United States setting up defense bases in the Pacific. In the United States, after the war, the situation in the Pacific appeared outwardly relaxed but internally strong, and attention was particularly paid to the issue of setting up defense bases in the Pacific. Army Chief of Staff General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower even traveled across the ocean, visiting the Pacific region in person and taking the opportunity to visit our country's highest leader, President Chiang Kai-shek, and Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the British Pacific Fleet inspecting the Far East, to discuss the major plan for Pacific defense. This further shows the importance of this issue, and our country has a direct interest and cannot be taken lightly. The Guangdong Provincial Assembly recently held a meeting and passed a resolution requesting the Central Government to negotiate with Britain to recover Hong Kong, stating that "Hong Kong and Kowloon are important coastal areas of Guangdong Province, and are of great importance to politics, economics, and national defense. They should be re-incorporated into China's territory. It has been decided to telegraph the Central Government to promptly negotiate with the British government to recover them to maintain territorial sovereignty and consolidate national defense." Therefore, the Hong Kong issue has once again become a problem of concern to the people in the midst of Pacific defense talk.

Hong Kong is our country's territory, ceded to Britain after the Opium War in 1842, and has been so for over a hundred years, but our compatriots still account for 80% of the residents of Hong Kong. Therefore, when Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang met in Cairo, they discussed the long-term plan for the Far East and agreed in principle to return Hong Kong to China. President Roosevelt, in his report on the Cairo Conference after returning to the United States, also said: "Regarding the Cairo Conference, the long-term plan for the Far East was discussed. The Far East will soon be rebuilt, and there are three principles: (1) to return property to its original owners; (2) to recognize the right of the people of the Far East to establish autonomous governments, without interference; and (3) the permanent elimination of the Japanese Empire is a prerequisite for maintaining peace in the Pacific and the world." From this, it can be seen that in the eyes of the great political diplomats of the United States, Hong Kong should be returned to China, without any question. When the war ended, our government should have negotiated with Britain for its return, but unfortunately, the situation in the Northeast changed, and the Communist Party attempted to occupy the Northeast. The withdrawal of Soviet troops was repeatedly delayed, making the nine provinces of the Northeast another complex diplomatic vortex. Therefore, diplomacy with the Soviet Union had to be considered the most urgent task, without time to attend to other matters, and the Hong Kong issue was put on hold. However, our people are still very concerned about this issue, especially paying attention to the British side's dynamics on this issue. The visit of Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the British Pacific Fleet, to China, and his meeting with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, in Japan, are even more the focus of our attention. Admiral Fraser once told the press in Shanghai that Hong Kong would remain a British naval base, which has caused dissatisfaction in our country's public opinion; when he arrived in Tokyo, he told a French news agency reporter that "China is willing for British troops to be stationed in Hong Kong." Our newspaper's special correspondent, fearing that this statement might be a false rumor, made a special trip to visit him, but Fraser said: "The situation in China is extremely chaotic, and in any case, they are still barbarians" (see the first page of our newspaper on May 12). As the commander-in-chief of the navy, such an inappropriate statement is regrettable, and we cannot but take it as a pity. In order to maintain friendly relations between the two countries, we cannot but refute Fraser's incoherent words. Although the British political scene after the war has been succeeded by the Labour Party, advocating socialism, in diplomacy, it still does not shed the style of the Conservative Party era, exposing the ferocious faces of imperialists everywhere. It even disregards the promises made during the war and the combat goals it proclaimed, and pursues its own self-interest. The Eight Points of the Atlantic Charter have long been thrown into the clouds. For example, on the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue, Britain not only has no intention of returning them to China, but also harbors great ambitions, having attempted to build a large-scale airfield in Ping Shan, Kowloon, to consolidate Hong Kong's position in the North Pacific. However, after repeated protests from our people, this plan was abandoned. This retrograde measure only shows that its efforts are becoming increasingly futile. Britain must know that the recovery of Hong Kong is the "national aspiration" of the Chinese people, and no one can go against it.

When discussing the Hong Kong issue, the scene of the fall of Hong Kong on December 25, 1941, is still vividly in our minds. The Hong Kong battle lasted less than two weeks, and the British army could not resist, surrendering with their hands tied. 11,000 officers and soldiers were captured, which is the most dishonorable page in modern British history. According to military experts, the main reason why the British army could not defend Hong Kong for long was that the British army failed to hold Kowloon until the Chinese army arrived to jointly defend Hong Kong. This historical recollection greatly helps Britain understand the position of Hong Kong. Britain is far away from Hong Kong by thousands of miles, and once something happens, it will be impossible to protect it in any way. It was so before the war, and it will be so in the future. Moreover, the situation in the Pacific after the war has undergone tremendous changes. No matter which perspective you look from, Britain has no need to maintain Hong Kong as a naval base for any country.

Britain's return of Hong Kong to China is, in theory, the proper thing to do. Even emotionally, the British people cannot but regard the abandonment of Hong Kong as a symbol of the decline of the British Empire, or may inevitably cause the die-hards to sigh with emotion, unable to let go, but the rulers should broaden their horizons, face reality, and understand the domestic and international situation. Recently, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee allowed India to become independent on the one hand, and announced the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt on the other. The British Labour Party government does have a new trend, earning praise from all over the world. We deeply hope that the British authorities can also take enlightened measures on the Hong Kong issue.

### Tokyo Trials of Japanese War Criminals; Kiyose Attempts to Limit Court Authority; Prosecutor Sternly Refutes; General Sun Liren Attends Hearing in Tokyo

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 13th] Well-informed sources say that the Japanese war criminal defense lawyers requested General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to establish a defense group under the MacArthur Headquarters, like the prosecution group under the MacArthur Headquarters. MacArthur, after hearing this request, rejected it.

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 13th] The International Military Tribunal continued its trial work today. Yosuke Matsuoka, who opposed the League of Nations and signed the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, was also among those on trial, but was unable to attend due to illness. General Sun Liren, commander of the New First Army, passed through Tokyo and also attended the hearing this morning. Most journalists were very familiar with this hero of the Burma campaign. General Sun sat in the honorary seat, his eyes constantly fixed on the twenty-six Japanese defendants. Kiyose, the chief Japanese defense lawyer, argued with the nine judges for two hours. Kiyose pointed out that after the "Manchurian Incident," the Soviet government recognized "Manchukuo," because the Soviet side sold the Chinese Eastern Railway to the "Manchukuo government," so the Manchurian aspect must not be within the scope of the trial. The Soviet assistant prosecutor handed a note to Chief Prosecutor Keenan. Keenan immediately stood up to stop Kiyose's argument and said to Chief Justice Webb: "The court does not allow Kiyose to argue in this way." Webb said: "Continue speaking." Keenan said: "Japanese defense lawyers must list the facts." Webb then ordered the Japanese defense lawyers to argue based on the facts. Kiyose said: "I understand," but continued to raise several questions related to the Soviet Union. He said: Japan and the Soviet Union have a neutral relationship, so there is no need to fight. Keenan stood up again, requesting Webb to stop this kind of debate, because it has exceeded the scope of the facts. After that, Kiyose stopped the unnecessary debate, and the court rested for fifteen minutes. When the court reopened, Keenan immediately stood up and delivered a speech, opposing any attempt by the defendants to limit the authority of the court and not to distort the true meaning of the Potsdam Declaration. He firmly insisted that all war criminals must be given a fair trial, including the Japanese who abused Allied prisoners of war. He did not admit that Japan's surrender was subject to any conditions. At 4:50, the debate was temporarily adjourned, and the presiding judge announced that the debate would continue at 9:30 tomorrow morning.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Special Dispatch] Today, Ichiro Kiyose, Tojo's defense lawyer, submitted an application on behalf of all the Japanese defense lawyers, questioning the scope of war crimes and the issue of its jurisdiction prescribed by the International Military Tribunal this morning. Kiyose Ichiro firmly stated that Japan's occupation of the Northeast does not fall within the scope of the Pacific War or the "Greater East Asia War." He pointed out that the "Manchurian Incident," which created "Manchukuo," was tacitly approved by the Soviet Union. Tojo's lawyer directly told the Soviet judge that Soviet Russia sold the Chinese Eastern Railway to "Manchukuo," which meant that the Soviet Union recognized the existence of the Manchurian puppet state. Kiyose Ichiro pointed out that the Changkufeng Incident in 1938 and the Nomonhan Incident in 1939 had been resolved by agreements signed by the Soviet and Japanese governments. Keenan stopped his debate, opposing "this method of debate." Judge Webb told Kiyose not to make arguments that violate the facts. Kiyose continued to point out that due to violations of the agreement, the Changkufeng and Nomonhan incidents have been resolved, so the accusations in Articles 51 and 52 based on the two incidents should be withdrawn from the complaint. Keenan immediately stood up and declared: The Soviet prosecutor "denies that the defendant's lawyer's statement regarding the Changkufeng incident is true." Kiyose continued to demand that he be allowed to present evidence to prove his statement.

### Kiyose's Crafty Defense: A Distorted Interpretation of the Potsdam Declaration

[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] In today's session of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Kiyose Ichiro, the white-haired defense counsel for Tojo, representing the twenty-eight Japanese defendants, loudly accused the United Nations of indicting former Japanese leaders for crimes against peace and humanity, claiming it was "beyond the scope of international law."

### A Delusional Attempt to Exonerate

When Kiyose began to question the court's jurisdiction, he declared: "The Potsdam Declaration not only binds Japan but also the United Nations." According to the Potsdam Agreement, the United Nations was only permitted to prosecute war criminals who violated established laws and war customs, and it did not include new items listed in the indictment, such as holding the defendants responsible for inciting war and abusing the people of the United Nations. "Japan's surrender is very different from Germany's surrender. Germany resisted to the end and finally collapsed. This was unconditional surrender." The Potsdam Declaration stipulated the conditions for Japan's armistice, "This is a kind of proposal," but as such, it was accepted, and as such, the United Nations must abide by it. The United Nations could punish war criminals in the Nuremberg Tribunal without trial, because Germany surrendered unconditionally. The United Nations' indictment against the Japanese defendants exceeds existing international law. No international code in the world mentions planning war as a war crime. Kiyose also cited several sections of the British War Code, proving that war crimes are specifically defined as four types: violations of military rights by non-combatants, looting, espionage, and sabotage. He also stated that until July 1945, various existing laws, regardless of the nature of the war, could not consider planning, initiating, and executing war as a violation of peace. Kiyose said: Although the Potsdam Declaration has provisions for strict laws, "We Japanese never expected that the declaration would extend to crimes against peace and bring charges against important politicians, diplomats, and other important figures in Japan." When Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, it only knew that the punishment of war criminals should be based on the existing international law.

The trial is progressing very slowly due to language barriers. Kiyose speaks English fluently but speaks in Japanese, but he often corrects the translator's mistakes to ensure the meaning is correct.

Kiyose then mentioned that Japan and the Soviet Union had signed an agreement in 1938 to resolve the undeclared war over Changkufeng and settle border disputes. Soviet Judge Zaryanov objected, and Presiding Judge Webb ordered Kiyose's remarks to be removed from the record. Kiyose also requested that the charges against Thailand be dropped because "Thailand is not a member of the United Nations, neither in the past nor now," so the court has no jurisdiction to act on its behalf. He also said: It is surprising that the person accused of the various charges related to Thailand was in Tokyo and not in Thailand at the time of the incident.

### The Court Surrounded by Heavy Barbed Wire

Of the twenty-eight Japanese war criminal defendants, only twenty-six were present today. The two absent were Okawa Shumei, who acted abnormally in the second trial and is undergoing psychiatric examination, and former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, who is also undergoing medical examination. The Army Ministry building where the courtroom is located is now surrounded by a circle of high barbed wire, a new security measure. Military police continue to guard all entrances and exits and search all United Nations and Japanese spectators.

### Hunchback Without Hump in the Imperial Secret Zoo

[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] The serious food situation in Japan has caused the Mongolian camels in the Imperial Zoo to almost lose their humps. The humps of these tall animals are now shrinking and drooping. The park manager believes this is due to replacing their original food of oatmeal with sweet potato peels obtained from the US Army kitchen.

### Judges Mostly Wearing Black Glasses

[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] When the International Military Tribunal for the Far East opened today, seven of the nine judges were wearing black glasses to avoid the strong lights installed for photography. The only ones not wearing glasses were Massachusetts High Court Judge Higgins and Soviet Judge Zaryanov. The defendants were also affected by the glare. Sato wore black glasses, while Itagaki appeared to be dozing off. Only Nami Jiro wore sunglasses in the defendant's seat.

### The Trial Court Twice Warned the Defendant's Lawyer, Advising Him Not to Use Incendiary Language

Today, the International Court heard arguments from Japanese defense lawyers regarding jurisdictional limits. Presiding Judge Webb twice cautioned the defendant's lawyer, first criticizing his use of embellished language and then warning him not to use inflammatory language to avoid prejudicing the court. Lee Nan asked the court to allow him to read excerpts from President Roosevelt's 1942 radio address, which proved that the United Nations had long wanted to legally punish Axis leaders and their accomplices for inciting war. After consulting with the judge, Ji Nan cited the words of Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, and Chairman Chiang, and declared to the court that he could be trusted not to exceed the bounds of propriety? British Deputy Prosecutor Kerr was also unparalleled.

### Iranian Azerbaijan Representative Reopens Negotiations with the Government, Hope for Peaceful Resolution Gradually Increases, Government Troops Still Pouring into the Border

[United Press, Tehran, 12th] According to sources close to the Iranian Prime Minister this evening, negotiations between the Azerbaijan Democratic Delegation and Iranian Prime Minister Sa'ed, which had been deadlocked for several days, have resumed today. It is said that the resumption of negotiations was at the request of the head of the Azerbaijan delegation, Bishi Vari. During the negotiations, Bishi withdrew the counter-proposal that had led to the breakdown of negotiations. Political figures believe tonight that a peaceful resolution is now more hopeful, but Monday's London morning papers cited a broadcast from the British Broadcasting Corporation, stating that Azerbaijan has "declared war on the central Iranian government." The broadcast also stated: "Our army is now marching towards Tehran." The daily briefing emphasized that the news of the declaration of war was initially reported by some quarters, but was later denied. Last Sunday evening, United Press reported from Tehran that negotiations had resumed, but did not mention news of war. [United Press, Tehran, 12th] Reliable Iranian government officials said today that although the British Broadcasting Corporation announced that the people of Azerbaijan are "prepared for war," a civil war in Iran is unlikely to occur for the time being, or may even be averted. Azerbaijan Prime Minister Bishi Vari had originally arrived at the Tehran airport yesterday to prepare to return to Great Britain, but was unable to do so due to bad weather. He then met with Central Government Prime Minister Sa'ed, expressing his willingness to reopen negotiations based on the government's proposal. The government's proposal stipulates that Azerbaijan return to the jurisdiction of the central government, but retain certain autonomous rights. Bishi Vari is reportedly prepared to withdraw certain points of the counter-proposal he made to facilitate progress and reach an agreement soon.

Tehran Radio broadcast a denial of a report by a news agency that Sa'ed was willing to use force to resolve the Azerbaijan issue. However, the tense situation in Iran in recent days and the continuous flow of reinforcements to the Kurdistan border are true. An army officer also admitted yesterday that a large number of munitions and some soldiers were transported to support the Chalfagari and Afshar tribes loyal to the central government.

[Reuters, Tehran, 13th] One person estimated that if the Iranian government took military action against Azerbaijan, the number of troops it could mobilize would not exceed 10,000, which is less than the strength of the Azerbaijan Democratic Army.

### Arab Groups Seek Assistance from the Soviet Union

Requesting that the Palestine Issue

Be Submitted to the Security Council for Discussion

[United Press, Cairo, 13th] According to reliable sources: The Arab Higher Committee has urged the Soviet Union to submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations Security Council, and declared that the "oppression" imposed by democratic countries is worse than the "aggressive warmongering" of the Nazis and Fascists.

### Implementing Economic Boycott Against Britain and the United States

[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 12th] Secretary-General of the Arab Higher Committee, Husseini, recently sent a telegram to the Prime Ministers of Syria and Lebanon, requesting an economic boycott of Britain and the United States, and said, "Before the Arab Conference (to be held near Damascus on the 18th) resolves the issue, please do not grant economic benefits to Britain and the United States."

### Jewish Secret Party Warns Britain

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 13th] The underground radio station of the Jewish Resistance Movement, "Voice of Israel," broadcast the night before last, stating that even if the recommendations in the Anglo-American Palestine Survey Report are not implemented, Palestine will be forced to resist "Britain's establishment of military bases in Palestine." The Jewish Resistance Movement is determined to obstruct Britain's efforts to make Palestine its military camp.

### The Impact of the Japanese People's Intrusion into the Imperial Palace Spreads Throughout the Country, Police Authorities Issue a Warning, Demonstrators Will Arrive One After Another

[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] The intrusion of a group of people demanding food and political leadership into the sacred grounds of the Emperor's Palace, the supreme authority in Japan, yesterday is unprecedented in Japanese history. (See yesterday's Japanese newspaper for details) In the history of Japan's entire food crisis and political instability, no crowd has ever dared to break into the Imperial Palace grounds, at most submitting petitions through government offices. The most reckless intrusion into the Imperial Palace grounds occurred on the night of August 15, 1945, when several stubborn military officers broke through the gate and rushed into the Imperial Household Ministry to search for the recording of the Emperor's surrender edict, intending to take it away. The impact of yesterday's incident has spread throughout the country, but the Japanese do not consider this act disrespectful to the Imperial Family. If it had happened a few months ago, the reaction would have been strong. This factor seems to be a symbol of the new relationship between the Emperor and the people. It is reported that the Police Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a warning, saying that the people of Japan are increasingly uneasy about the current political crisis that has not been resolved for a long time, and it is expected that a large number of demonstrators will arrive one after another.

### British Labour Party Chairman Advocates Cooperation with the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] British Labour Party Chairman Laski, in a speech in Cardiff, said: The British Labour Party knows the necessity of maintaining a strong friendship with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union should also tell us the scope of its demands. If it is said that we must choose between the United States and the Soviet Union, I will answer that we do not need to choose. The Labour Party supports the Soviet Union one hundred percent.

### British Troops Stationed in Egypt Eager to Return Home

[Reuters, Cairo, 13th] Representatives of the British-Egyptian treaty negotiations visited the barracks at the mouth of the Nile yesterday, and British soldiers shouted "We want to go home" to them. Egyptian people also shouted "Support the withdrawal of troops and the unification of the Nile River basin."

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Continues, Striving for Agreement, Bevin Returns to Paris from London Yesterday, Possible Compromise on the Ruhr Question

[United Press, Paris, 13th] After a one-day break, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference continued today, striving to resolve the points on which no agreement has yet been reached, and the French proposal to separate the Ruhr armaments zone from Germany seems to have a possibility of compromise. French sources said that the British recently suggested adopting a joint system in the Ruhr region, even including part of the Rhineland. This approach may lead to a compromise. In addition, important issues such as the Italian treaty seem to be resolvable through compromise, except for the Trieste issue.

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to England at the end of last week to report to Prime Minister Attlee, and flew here at 7:30 pm (Shanghai time) today in order to proceed with the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. Bevin did not make a statement when he left London. It is widely believed that Bevin's sudden return to England was because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov agreed to change his attitude towards the Italian treaty in the Friday night and Saturday meetings, so he needed to consult with the British Prime Minister on the possible change in Britain's position on this issue. The London Observer now believes that the success or failure of the Paris Conference may be decided early this week.

### The Bernays Couple Enjoyed the Scenery of the Streets of Paris

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] Yesterday was the first anniversary of the victory in World War II. The entire city of Paris celebrated enthusiastically, and the Champs-Élysées was crowded with people. Americans Bernays and Vandenberg, in plain clothes, walked through the streets crowded with people and fluttering national flags, feeling extremely happy. Bernays then returned to the American delegation's residence and went out again with his wife to enjoy the street scene. Afterwards, Bernays told people: I officially participated in the celebration in front of the statue of Joan of Arc on Victory Day morning on behalf of my country, and then enjoyed the fun with the citizens of Paris. It was really a happy event in my life.

### France Commemorates Joan of Arc with a Military Parade

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Today, the whole country celebrated the Joan of Arc Festival. All public buildings in the country were decorated with French and Allied flags. The first celebration in Paris was held in front of the statue of Joan of Arc in the Pyramid Palace. Foreign Minister Couve de Murville and other cabinet members were present. At the military parade held at the Élysée Palace, crowds gathered. Foreign dignitaries who participated included US Secretary of State Bernays, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Chinese Ambassador to France Qian Tai, and Cambodian King Sihanouk. After the ceremony, President de Gaulle walked to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and gave a brief speech. General de Gaulle did not participate in this ceremony, but went to the statue of "Tiger Prime Minister" Clemenceau, who was prime minister before the last war, to lay a wreath and deliver a speech, saying: France must obtain a hero of the moment to relieve it when it encounters a crisis. It is a pity that there are still demons poisoning France.

### De Gaulle Declares He Will Not Participate in the Election

### Italian King Victor Emmanuel III Arrives in Egypt Overwhelmed by Feelings of the Past and Present

[United Press, Alexandria, 12th] Italian King Victor Emmanuel III, accompanied by Queen Helen, who had been exiled here, disembarked here today from an Italian cruiser and went to the palace of Egyptian King Farouk for temporary residence. The short-statured Victor Emmanuel was welcomed by Farouk, who stepped forward to greet him, but did not accompany him to the Antoniades Palace. There were police guards along the route from the pier to the palace, but the streets were almost deserted. Recalling the grand welcome with tens of thousands of people lining the streets when the King and Queen visited Egypt in 1933, I am overwhelmed by the feelings of the past and present. This time, the King and his party took a sedan escorted by police on motorized bicycles to the palace. When the King left the ship, he said to all the crew members: "I bid farewell to you, you are the people I have loved all my life!"

The original purchase price of these facilities was $1.1 billion and $2 million.

### Morrison Arrives in the US to Negotiate, Intensifying the Anti-Famine Struggle, Hoover Arrives in Washington on the Same Day to Report to the President, the US May Restore Food Rationing

[United Press International, Washington, 13th] British Privy Council member Morrison flew here from London yesterday. After getting off the plane, he told reporters that only by taking various powerful measures can the famine be saved. He also said that his visit was to negotiate with President Truman on how to prevent the goal of the Five Powers struggling to the end from being affected by the global famine. We defeated Nazi Germany and Japan. I don't believe we can't win the anti-famine struggle that can control the fate of the world. But at this moment, it is undeniable that this battle is unfavorable to us. Famine can kill countless civilians and spread the germs of fascism more quickly than Hitler and Mussolini could. Morrison added that the Indian issue was certainly within the scope of his discussion. In addition, a London correspondent for the World Post learned from a senior authority that Morrison will ask President Truman to implement meat and fat consumption restrictions in the United States.

At the same time, Hoover, chairman of the Relief Committee, has returned here after a 35,000-mile world food inspection. He will meet with Agriculture Secretary Anderson and report the results of his trip to President Truman today.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] A senior US official said that if the results of the relief movement do not improve quickly, Paul, the head of the US Price Stabilization Bureau, may suggest to the President that the domestic food rationing system be restored between August, and even bread should be rationed. Paul guides government economic agencies such as the Management Bureau, the Wage Adjustment Board, and other similar agencies, and is one of Truman's key advisors. According to Paul's friends, he has made arrangements for the restoration of the food rationing system, which can be implemented once needed.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Governor-General Wavell's direct appeal to President Truman for more food for India and the urgent flight of British Privy Council member Morrison to Washington to hold talks with the US President have now focused world attention on the severe food situation encountered in India and Eurasia. Britain has now reduced food rations by 10%, and former UNRRA Director Lehman has also appealed to Washington to restore food rationing in the United States and double the amount of food shipped to famine areas.

### British and American Food Committees are Declared Established

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The State Department issued a communique today stating that the British-American Rice Committee has been established on the date of the publication of the British-American Siam Agreement. The purpose of the committee is to increase the amount of Siamese rice exports. The British previously signed an agreement with Siam, stipulating that Siam would provide surplus rice to countries designated by Britain at no cost. The United States believes that this is most likely to hinder China and India from obtaining the urgently needed Siamese rice as soon as possible. This provision has been declared canceled in the agreement.

### Soviet Ship Sailed from India to the Black Sea

### British Delegation Returns to New Delhi Today, Visit to India Not Concluded, Viceroy Considers Establishing Provisional Government, Announcement to be Made on Breakdown of Round Table Conference

[United Press, Simla, 12th Dispatch] The Indian Independence Round Table Conference was formally declared broken after meeting for one hour today. Given this situation, there will inevitably be a major reaction nationwide, which may not only cause hatred between Hindu and Muslim Indians, but may also cause hatred between British and Indian people. According to the British Cabinet Delegation, a statement will be issued within days, indicating the steps to be taken thereafter. Many Indians originally hoped that British rule would be quickly transferred to Indian self-rule. The breakdown of this conference is a major blow. According to a joint communique, after considering the proposals put forward by the Muslim League and the Congress Party, it was deemed that further discussions would be fruitless and that the conference should be declared closed. The British Cabinet Delegation solemnly stated that both sides had made every effort to find a solution, and therefore neither side was to blame for the breakdown of the conference. The letters exchanged between the two sides during the conference will be published within days. The second joint communique issued by the British Cabinet Delegation and the Viceroy emphasized that although the conference has broken down, the mission has not ended, and announced that the delegation is scheduled to leave for New Delhi this Tuesday.

The issue of India is now about to be resolved, and from now on, we will no longer allow India to become a prison of the British Empire. As for the Egyptian event, the answer is very simple. If people still want to rely on power politics, then the Second World War has already been created, and a third one is bound to happen.

### Britain, Canada, and Newfoundland Secretly Sign Defense Agreement, Shaking US-Canada Joint Defense Plan, Canadian Prime Minister Departs for London

[Wood Newspaper Report] London, 13th Broadcast: Canadian Prime Minister King arrived in New York today. He will board the British mail ship "Queen Mary" to London to attend the final stage of the Dominion Prime Ministers' Conference.

[United Press, Ottawa, 13th Dispatch] Canada, Britain, and Newfoundland secretly signed an agreement on the defense of Newfoundland on April 8th. It was only announced a few days ago, and has subjected the cooperation between the United States and Canada in formulating North American defense work to the first severe shake-up since the outbreak of war seven years ago. The United States has defense bases in several locations on the island of Newfoundland, with a 99-year lease right, and has spent 200 million US dollars to construct defense projects. Therefore, the United States has long recognized that the main responsibility for defending Newfoundland lies with the US side, because the island's location controls air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and is essential for protecting North America from European attacks. The US had no knowledge of this treaty, which has caused considerable surprise among US officials. However, Washington officials say the new agreement does not change the US relationship with Canada or Newfoundland.

### President Soong Officially Announces Wu Kuo-cheng as Shanghai Mayor, Deputy Mayor Ho Teh-kwei Rumored to Succeed as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Directors of Finance, Police, Education, and Health Bureaus Tender Resignations

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] President of the Executive Yuan Soong Tzu-wen officially announced tonight that former Minister of Propaganda Wu Kuo-cheng has been appointed as the new Mayor of Shanghai. Soong will hold a press conference tomorrow to announce various new appointments.

Brief Biography of Wu Kuo-cheng

Wu Kuo-cheng was born in October of the ninth year before the founding of the Republic of China in Sanli, a small town in Jianshi, Hubei. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he graduated from Tsinghua School in Beijing. In the twelfth year, he graduated from Grinnell College in the United States with a bachelor's degree. In the thirteenth year, he obtained a master's degree from Princeton University in the United States. In the fifteenth year, he obtained a Ph.D. in political science from the same university.

In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he served as Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Chief of the Liaison Section of the Jiangsu Diplomatic Affairs Office, Deputy Director of the First Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Member of the Treaty Committee. In the seventeenth year, he served as the Director of the Hubei Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau. In the eighteenth year, he served as a Senior Advisor to the Wuhan Special Municipal Government, Director of the Land Bureau and Director of the Finance Bureau of the Hankou Special Municipal Government. Soon, Wu was promoted to Mayor of Hankou. At this time, Wu was only in his thirties, making him one of the youngest mayors in Chinese history. In addition to his astute and capable administrative skills, Wu also speaks fluent English. Madame Chiang Kai-shek once praised Wu in this way: "In China, I have never seen a returned student who can speak such good English!"

After Wu retreated from Wuhan to Chongqing, he soon became the Mayor of the capital. In the spring of the 28th year, Wu presented a request to President Chiang, who approved the organization of a special guard regiment and a mass self-defense force. Later, Wu was transferred to Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in the 34th year, he was promoted to Minister of Propaganda, a position he has held until now. Wu's wife is Ms. Huang Mary, the daughter of Huang Kung-wei, the former Director of the Hanyang Arsenal.

### Bureau Directors Tender Resignations

[Our Newspaper Report] According to reliable sources: Mayor of this city, Chien Ta-chun, has submitted a request for resignation, which has been approved, and he will be appointed to another position. After Wu Kuo-cheng, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, succeeds him, the system of Deputy Mayor of the Municipal Government will be abolished. Shen Shih-hua will resign from the position of Secretary-General, to be succeeded by Deputy Mayor Ho Teh-kwei.

The bureau directors who have submitted resignations include: Director of the Finance Bureau Pu Cheng-tung, Director of the Police Bureau Hsuan Tieh-wu, Director of the Health Bureau Yu Sung-chun, Director of the Education Bureau Ku Yu-hsiu, and Director of the Land Bureau Chen Shih-chuan. In addition, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, the Director of the Personnel Department, the Chief of the Liaison Section, and the directors of the relevant offices will also tender their resignations.

The candidate for the Police Bureau Director, which is of greatest concern to all sectors of the city, is rumored to be Chen Hsi-tseng, Director of the General Affairs Bureau of the Civil Service Department of the National Government. It is also rumored that Li Shih-chen, Director of Academic Affairs of the Central Police Academy, or Yu Shu-ping, the current Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, may also succeed. Yu graduated from the Vienna Police Academy and also studied law at the University of Vienna, earning a Ph.D. After returning to China, he successively held important positions as a university professor and in the Central Party Headquarters' Examination Yuan, and is one of China's leading police experts.

### Director Pu Discusses Tax Revenue Issues, Housing Donation Rate Not Increased, Can Be Agreed Upon by Landlord and Tenant

[Our Newspaper Report] Pu Cheng-tung, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, is determined to resign and has submitted his resignation to Mayor Chien, requesting its approval by the Executive Yuan. Director Pu told reporters yesterday that at the beginning of the Finance Bureau's takeover, tax revenue was only over 60 million yuan. Since then, it has increased month by month, reaching over 3 billion yuan last month. There are also other taxes taken by the central government from the local government, totaling about 1.3 billion yuan. The total amount for this month should exceed 4.5 billion yuan. The bureau adheres to the principle of "preventing corruption and eliminating embezzlement" so that every penny paid by the people goes into the national treasury. It strictly manages the personnel of the entire bureau, and believes that all members of the bureau are honest and self-disciplined. As for whether there are any loopholes among tax investigators, this is unknown. However, the Finance Bureau's revenue and expenditure have precise and complex procedures. All cash revenue does not go through the hands of the bureau's personnel, but is handled by specialized institutions and directly paid to the municipal bank. Expenditure procedures are even more precise. The payment order must be stamped with the blue seals of the Mayor, Chief Accountant, Audit Office, and Finance Bureau before it can be paid. Regarding the method of collecting housing donations in this city, Director Pu believes that there is a need for improvement. Before the war, housing donations accounted for 60% of the income of the Public Works Bureau, while now most taxes are taken from entertainment, banquets, and other donations, which is not very reasonable. Every citizen should be jointly responsible for the municipal government's tax revenue. Therefore, he advocates that in the future, the number of housing donations should not be specified, and can be agreed upon by the landlord and tenant themselves. The municipal government's housing donation rate should also not be increased, and should still be collected at 14%. This will not only increase the municipal government's revenue, but also prevent second landlords from extorting gold bars, and large landlords will not be unwilling to build new houses because they lose ownership of the houses. If the municipal government's finances can be implemented in this way, then revenue will be abundant.

### Pharmaceuticals Made by the Health Bureau More Effective Than DDT, City's Epidemic Prevention Work Active

[Our Newspaper Report] Yu Sung-chun, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, has handled the city's health facilities since taking office, paying attention to all aspects of work in an environment of lack of financial resources, materials, and manpower, and has achieved considerable success. In particular, the establishment of free hospital beds in various municipal hospitals and some private hospitals, as well as epidemic prevention work, have done his best. It is heard that Director Yu also intends to resign from his position in the Health Bureau. The reporter made a special visit yesterday, and Yu said that he had the intention to resign three months ago, and the handover procedures had been prepared long ago. He has now formally submitted his resignation to the Mayor. Director Yu said that he has always been cautious and self-disciplined in the past six months or so, which is his most gratifying point. Regarding the most urgent epidemic prevention work, he has actively planned to promote it, and will convene medical experts tomorrow to discuss the most effective implementation methods. The biggest source of epidemic transmission is unclean drinking water, especially in the Xuhui, Zhabei, and Xujiahui districts. Therefore, the inspection of water sources and disinfection work has been strengthened. Starting next week, the city will train the staff of various restaurants by district, alternately teaching them how to manage food in their spare time, and then hold competitions in stages. The trophy will be set up in the best restaurant to reward each winner. Because the Health Bureau's DDT inventory from the Executive Yuan is not enough to distribute, all of the bureau's DDT has been used up. Therefore, the bureau has made its own pharmaceuticals similar to DDT, which are specially used for long-term injections in dead rivers where mosquitoes and flies breed the most. The effect is stronger than DDT. In addition, the vaccines produced by the bureau are now sufficient for 2 million people, and not only can they be used for free injections for the citizens of this city, but also other cities have successively requested supplies.

### Labor and Management Still Not Negotiating, All Tailoring Shops Closed, Key Issue is Compensation for Dismissed Workers

[Our Newspaper Report] The labor dispute in the tailoring industry is still at a stalemate. Yesterday morning, hundreds of worker representatives went to the General Labor Union, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other agencies to petition, demanding the release of 14 arrested workers. The General Labor Union agreed to take responsibility for the negotiations, but representatives from both labor and management did not meet throughout the day, and negotiations could not begin. As a result, all tailoring shops in the city were forced to close down yesterday. Regarding the fact that the Garrison Headquarters convened representatives from both sides for a final negotiation at 6 PM this afternoon, the labor side said that it was verbally informed by a responsible person from the headquarters, but the management side said that it had not yet received a notice from the relevant parties. Once the notice arrives, they will gladly accept mediation and participate in the negotiations. The reporter visited the responsible persons of both labor and management separately yesterday, referring to the current preconditions as compensation for the damage and the release of the arrested workers. The new clothes that were splashed with ink at Peiromon Tailors on Nanjing Road included a summer suit from Lee & Lan. The total loss of tailoring shops in the city is more than 100 million yuan. The fourteen workers involved in the incident have been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters.

The employers' association published a notice in the newspapers yesterday, detailing the history of wage increases. It also stated that the workers' irregular actions have caused significant losses to various shops, and they have been forced to close down. They appealed to all sectors to uphold justice.

The labor side said that labor-management negotiations have been delayed for months, and the management side has been delaying. The workers were forced to endure it for their livelihoods and could no longer bear it. Therefore, some workers were motivated by righteous indignation and took irregular actions, which will be stopped in the future. However, they hope that the problem will be resolved as soon as possible, and the workers cannot wait any longer.

Also, a person in charge of the management side said that the average wage in this industry is better than in other industries, but the workers still use force to threaten and commit acts of violence and destruction. The management side has been forced to make concessions more than once. The cost of living in April was low, but the management side sought to pay 4,700 yuan. The labor side advertised and deliberately reported the cost of living index lower each month, with nothing more than to deceive society and blame the management side. Also, the labor side claimed that the management side's cost of imported materials was as high as 200,000 yuan, while the cost of materials plus labor was only 60,000 yuan. This kind of accusation is unprecedented. The average cost of imported materials is about 100,000 yuan.

### Fushin Workers Demand Reinstatement

[Our Newspaper Report] The hundred and several dozen workers of the Fushin Flour Mills Nos. 2 and 8 who were laid off in the 30th year of the Republic of China are now demanding reinstatement and appropriate subsidies, but this has been rejected by the factory. Although it has been mediated by the General Labor Union and the Flour Mill Trade Association of the Fourth District, there has been no result. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene representatives from both sides at 2 PM today to discuss and mediate.

More than 200 unemployed workers from the Yitai Hing Coal Ball Factory on Macon Road marched to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to petition for reinstatement.

The picture shows Mrs. Hsieh, her eldest daughter Hsueh-fen, second daughter Lan-fen, eldest son Yu-min, and second son Chi-min, taken in Shanghai.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Announces Results of Engineer Examination

[Our Newspaper Report] Most of the newly purchased ocean-going ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company use oil as fuel. The mechanism of this engine is slightly different from that of coal-fired engines, so there are very few engineers who manage oil engines. The company specifically held an examination, and it is heard that there were many applicants. The examination has been completed. Yesterday, the names of the 24 people who were accepted and the 5 alternates were announced. The names of the accepted and alternate engineers are listed below: Accepted: Sun Ken-hai, Chu Ah-fang, Li Chung-lin, Tung Hsiang-ming, Sun Hui-li, Chung Pao-fa, Chu Kai-ming, Ni An-jen, Chien Hao-ken, Chang Sun-hung, Hsu Hung-chiang, Chen Chang-shun, Chen Ah-feng, Chu Hsien-kwei, Chen Yuan-sheng, Wang Jui-chang, Su Hung-fa, Chiu Shun-kwei, Yu Shan-pen, Ku Ming-hai, Yang Tsai-fu, Yu An-ching, Ma Kuo-ching, Pao Wen-sheng. Alternates: Lu Fu-tao, Wu Li-li, Chang An-kang, Chu Ah-wan, Chu Hung-hsuan.

### Problem of Streetcar Workers Reinstatement Resolved

[Our Newspaper Report] The labor dispute of the British Shanghai Electric Construction Company, in addition to the issues of sick leave and retirement, which were resolved last Saturday, the issue of adjusting basic wages and the reinstatement of unemployed workers was continued to be discussed at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. The meeting continued until late at night. The issue of reinstating unemployed workers was strongly debated. The workers demanded that 12 workers be reinstated for every additional streetcar, but the company only offered six. As a result, the Social Affairs Bureau proposed a compromise, and the number of workers to be reinstated for each additional streetcar would be decided by the Social Affairs Bureau, but must be between six and twelve. This long-standing problem was thus resolved. As for the workers' request to increase the basic wage to 45 yuan (the current minimum is one yuan per day, calculated according to the cost of living index, one day's deduction for one day's suspension), the meeting continued until late at night, and no solution was heard. Workers gathered to wait for news of the representatives' negotiations, and became very uneasy after waiting for a long time. If the negotiations were to reach a stalemate, it could cause another dispute.

### Stealing Skulls to Welcome the Gods: Defendant Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, Judge Cao of the Local Court opened the trial of a case of stealing skulls. Hu Xiantao, a 21-year-old Shanghai native living in a wooden house at the Nandamatou ferry, was a boatman. In the first month of this year, due to local customs, corpse heads had to be stolen before welcoming the gods at the festival, in order to prepare for worshipping the gods. Therefore, Hu Xiantao and the fugitive Xi Longsheng went to the grave of Hua Jinsheng in Guojiasha and its vicinity on the nights of the 16th and 17th, stealing two skulls, which they brought back to participate.

They were prosecuted for the crime of stealing remains under Article 247, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The defendant pleaded guilty in court.

### Monk Acts Righteously: Rescues American Pilot, Japanese Military Police Use Poisonous Torture, Non-Judicial Beatings Fracture Skull

Following the Jiangyin Massacre, the Shanghai Military Tribunal also investigated the case of Xue the Monk, who was brutally murdered by the former Pudong Japanese military police for rescuing an American pilot. Yesterday, Gu Yongquan, the military prosecutor of the tribunal, completed the investigation and filed a public prosecution. The details of the case are as follows.

Intelligence in an Emergency: In January of last year, an American aircraft flew over Shanghai and attacked Longhua Airport, dropping many bombs and causing great damage to the enemy. The Japanese army's anti-aircraft fire was intense. The American aircraft was unfortunately damaged. Two American pilots parachuted out, one of whose name is unknown, landing in Xuejiazhaidi, Binpu Township, Sanlin Town, Pudong. The villagers all acted righteously, discussing rescue together. Later, the American friend was rescued by Xue the Monk, the head of the township. Because it was daytime, the former Pudong Japanese military police learned of this. Infuriated, they dispatched investigators everywhere, searching in every way, but found nothing. Xue the Monk, feeling the urgency of the situation, quickly changed the American friend's clothes and hid him in a watchman's shed in the fields, saving him from danger, and buried the rubber coat he was wearing to eliminate traces. At that time, the captain of the Pudong Japanese military police, Ono Shigeru (at large), Kuboe Yasuharu (male, 33 years old, from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, former head of the special intelligence section of the Japanese Pudong Military Police, in custody), Kataoka Akira (male, 29 years old, from Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, sergeant of the Yangsiqiao branch of the same unit, in custody), Omori Mitsuo (male, 27 years old, from Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, corporal of the Yangsiqiao branch of the same unit, in custody), Noma Teiji (male, 28 years old, from Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, sergeant of the Dongchang Road branch of the same unit, in custody), Morishita Muneo (male, 24 years old, from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, private first class of the Dongchang Road branch of the same unit, in custody), and Hirata Seiichi (sergeant of the Dongchang Road branch of the same unit, at large), were eager to gain credit and searched repeatedly, but still found nothing.

Wanton Beatings: They relied on their power to be brutal, arresting Xue Quanyun, Xue Yatou, Xue Zhangdong (i.e., Guan Nv), Xue the Monk, and Xue Jinxing, and wantonly beating them. In addition to clubbing and kicking, they also tied Xue Quanyun's hands behind his back, hung him from the beams, and beat him with clubs, causing him to be covered in injuries. Two days later, they dragged Xue the Monk and Xue Jinxing to the Dongchang Road branch, confining them separately, and beating them with non-judicial methods, causing Xue the Monk's skull to crack, his arm bone to fracture, with only skin and flesh connecting it, and his legs and abdomen were also covered in scars. Before two days had passed, he died. They forced Xue Jinxing to wash the blood off the deceased's face and moved the body to Sanguantang. Xue Jinxing was also covered in injuries, and his legs were swollen as thick as buckets, but he still did not confess. The defendants had no choice but to release him. Kuboe Yasuharu then telephoned Kataoka, instructing him to order the Xue family to accompany Xue the Monk home. Kataoka then gave Xue Quangen a business card, ordering him to take the card. When he arrived, he saw that Xue the Monk was already lying dead in Sanguantang. Xue Quangen, terrified by their power, suppressed his grief and dared not say anything.

Scheduled Trial: After the Japanese army surrendered, Xue Quangen submitted three photos of the deceased and reported to the Third Area Army Prisoner of War Management Office, accusing them. On February 9 of this year, the Third Detachment of the Military Police arrested Kuboe Yasuharu and handed him over to the Prisoner of War Management Office, along with a rubber coat and a bottle of medicine, and transferred them to the tribunal for investigation. During the investigation, witnesses Xue Quangen, Xue Bingxiang, Xue Linggen, and the victim Xue Jinxing testified about the circumstances of the torture, and identified Kataoka, Omori, and Noma at the Japanese military police concentration camp in western Shanghai as the perpetrators of the torture. Morishita had also participated in the investigation and arrest of villagers. Therefore, the tribunal detained them for investigation. The case has been thoroughly investigated. Except for Ono Shigeru and Hirata Seiichi, who are at large and wanted, the five people in custody, Kuboe Yasuharu, Kataoka Akira, Omori Mitsuo, Noma Teiji, and Morishita Muneo, are suspected of violating Article 28, Article 278, Paragraph 1, and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 1 and Article 2 of the War Crimes Trial Measures and Article 10 of the Implementing Regulations, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The tribunal will schedule a trial.

He invented a method to create a steel wire recorder, which was successfully completed in April. It is said that Chen did not have any foreign materials to test when he was researching, and he designed and manufactured everything himself. However, its function is no less than that of a recorder manufactured in the United States. In the future, it will be widely supplied to meet domestic needs, and its achievements are highly commendable. Chen is currently continuing to research various scientific instruments, which will not only enhance China's scientific position but also benefit humanity.

### UNRRA China Chief Resigns: No Impact on Relief to China, General Rooks Flew to Qingdao Yesterday for Inspection

### Tong Yuchun Teahouse Owner Ma Wenlin Detained for Collaborating with the Enemy, Residence and Teahouse Sealed

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ma Wenlin, a 45-year-old Henan native, residing at 6, Lane 109, Guangxi Road, has been running the Tong Yuchun Teahouse at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road for over a decade.

### First Interrogation: Cultural Traitor Tao Kangde Swaggered into Court

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, Judge Cao of the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court interrogated cultural traitor Tao Kangde for the first time. The traitor Tao submitted a lengthy defense statement of several thousand words, explaining his role as editor of the puppet "China Weekly" and his attendance at the "Greater East Asia Literary Conference." After Judge Cao's interrogation, he adjourned the hearing to a later date.

The traitor Tao is a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and is thirty-nine years old this year. He resides at No. 5, Lane 125, Jiaozhou Road. He did not receive a secondary education in his youth, but studied diligently on his own. Before the War of Resistance, he already held a considerable position in cultural circles. When Zou Taofen was the editor-in-chief of "Life" Weekly, Tao wrote "Telescope and Microscope," which was praised by many at the time. Later, he founded magazines such as "Cosmic Wind," "World Affairs," and "Great Wind," which were very popular for a time and highly respected in cultural circles. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he went to Hong Kong and, with the help of Xiong Shiyi, presided over the resumption of publication. In the spring of 1942, he defected to the enemy in Shanghai and served as the editor of the "China Weekly," a propaganda publication affiliated with the puppet "China Daily," promoting "peace movement." The following year, the publication ceased publication and he was dismissed. As a result, he was favored by the Japanese invaders and invited to participate in the "Greater East Asia Literary Conference" held in Tokyo. He was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters after the victory. After investigation by the High Procuratorate, he was formally prosecuted.

Still Seeking to Defeat the Enemy's Propaganda Passively

Still Claiming to Disrupt Enemy Propaganda in a Passive Way

Yesterday morning, when the defendant arrived in court, he was wearing a light brown silk robe, cloth shoes, and tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, with a very quiet demeanor. He stood in the defendant's box with his hands behind his back, swaggering as if giving a lecture, and often looked back as if searching for family members and acquaintances. After Judge Cao interrogated him one by one based on the indictment, the defendant immediately defended himself, claiming that the process of falling into the water was as follows: "After the National Army retreated west, the situation in Shanghai deteriorated, so I went to Hong Kong to plan the resumption of publications such as "Cosmic Wind," traveling between Guangzhou and Hong Kong to continue the cultural resistance. In October 1941, I returned to Shanghai once due to family matters. I originally planned to return to Hong Kong immediately and then go to the mainland, but the situation in the Pacific deteriorated and transportation was cut off, so I could not make the trip. Staying in Shanghai, making a living became a major problem. I wrote to old friends such as Lao She and Xu Xu in the mainland to find work, but received no good news. A friend introduced me to "China Weekly" to serve as an editor. I thought that the only things I could do were newspaper vendor, printing worker, and editor, and the first two jobs might promote enemy propaganda, while only the latter could disrupt their propaganda work. To be cautious, I also consulted with Zhu Wen, the acting director of the Propaganda Department of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and obtained his approval. I then proposed three conditions to the puppet side: (1) no speeches by important figures of the puppet Nanjing government should be published, (2) no current affairs reports should be published, and (3) I would not write any political opinions myself. The puppet side agreed to all of these, and I resolutely took the job, immediately changing the nature of the puppet "China Weekly," focusing especially on education and social issues. Therefore, my serving in this position was to use the puppet side's psychology of treating me as an ornament to disrupt their propaganda work in a passive way, and to actively collect information about the enemy."

When His Wife Sobbed He Said, "What Are You Crying About?"

As for participating in the "Greater East Asia Literary Conference," traitor Tao confessed that the conference was held three times (once each in 1942, 1943, and 1944). He refused to participate the first time. The second time, due to his position, he went after consulting with Committee Member Zhu. The conference lasted three days, discussing the translation of classical Chinese and Japanese literature. Japanese writers such as Mushanokoji Saneatsu, Sato Haruo, and Tanizaki Junichiro participated. After returning to China, he made a report and submitted it to Zhu Wen, who forwarded it to Wu Shaoshu, who praised it highly. Judge Cao asked, "How many people were in the Chinese delegation attending the conference?" He replied, "Forty-eight." Asked, "Who was the head of the delegation? Who were the central figures?" Traitor Tao faltered and said, "If it is not necessary, please allow me to remain silent. Because I have already been harmed, I don't want to implicate others." Judge Cao then asked him to submit it in writing. Subsequently, lawyer Ma Shuyong presented several documents, stating that Gao Jilin (Ke Ling), a propaganda officer in the Southeast District, was arrested by the enemy twice, and was rescued by the defendant, and that the defendant had taken great risks to print anti-Japanese propaganda materials for our underground workers. After the interrogation was completed, the defendant met with his family. His wife cried uncontrollably, and traitor Tao said loudly, "What am I worth crying about? Our country is what you should be crying for!" The court adjourned the hearing to a later date, and the defendant was taken back into custody. Yesterday morning, the case of Zhu Changsheng, the head of Minhang Bao, was also heard, accusing him of taking advantage of his power to bully good people during the enemy occupation. Two witnesses, Zhu Shanglin and Zhang Futian, testified in court. After Judge Cao interrogated them one by one, he also adjourned the hearing to a later date.

Second Trial of Traitor Cases Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

Yesterday afternoon at 11:30, Chief Judge Xiao, along with judges Hong Xiheng and Feng Zhidong, concluded the trial of two traitor cases: (1) Chang Dongming, Wu Maren, 27 years old, residing at No. 2, Taipingfang, Suzhou, in January 1942, applied for the puppet Wuxian District Chief Training Class. After graduation, he served as assistant in the puppet Jiangyin First District Office, instructor of Baojia in the puppet Wuxian County Government, and district chief in the puppet Guangfu District, Mudu District, and Hushu Pass District. While serving as director of the puppet Land Tax Collection Office, he purchased 6,000 dan of military rice for the enemy. The defendant claimed that he was forced by circumstances and that the purchase of military rice was a complete fabrication. (2) Yang Zhiwei, from Pudong, 20 years old, residing at No. 43, Shuiyongye Lane, Back Road, engaged in transportation, once used the enemy's power to defraud law-abiding citizens. The defendant still tried to quibble. After the defense lawyers' arguments, the court adjourned the judgment to 2:30 PM on October 17.

Xu Jidun and Xie Zhongfu Sentenced to Imprisonment

Yesterday, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court, presided over by Chief Judge Zhao, pronounced verdicts in three traitor cases: (1) Xu Jidun, the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Commissioner of Education, conspired with the enemy to plot against the country, sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, ten years of deprivation of civil rights, and all property confiscated, except for a reasonable amount to provide for the necessary living expenses of his family. (2) Xie Zhongfu, the puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissioner, conspired with the enemy to plot against the country, sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, ten years of deprivation of civil rights, and all property confiscated, except for a reasonable amount to provide for the necessary living expenses of his family.

### Wuhan University Preparatory Class: Impoverished Students Worry About Dropping Out

[Our Newspaper Hankou News] The university preparatory class established by the Ministry of Education in Wuhan began classes on the 1st of this month. Wuchang Wenhua Public Academy is the headquarters, accommodating 200 boarding female students and 200 day male students. The Boxue Academy in Qiaokou, Hankou, is a branch school, accommodating 800 male students. The Hubei Branch of the Executive Yuan allocated a batch of flour to provide relief to the teachers and students of the class, but the quota was limited to only 300 people, with each person receiving 45 pounds per month. The class has recently decided to distribute it to 270 students and 30 faculty members, and each person must find three guarantors, and the guarantors cannot receive the allowance, so this matter is extremely difficult to handle. Regarding the loan for impoverished students, the Ministry of Education has limited the number of applicants to 400, with each person receiving 5,000 yuan per month, and each person must find two guarantors, which means that only one out of three people can apply, but everyone wants to receive the loan, which is also not easy to handle. The boarding students' food expenses are 18,000 yuan per month, plus the cost of books and stationery. If there is no public funding to receive, impoverished students will have no place to study.

### Silversmiths Rush in, Gold Price Rises Again by 100,000 - Peak Reached 1.85 Million - Allotment Price Increased to 1.76 Million

Yesterday, gold continued to be sought after, with people being stimulated by various rumors. Buying was more than constant. The Central Bank allotted 561 bars to the industry and was forced to raise the price to 1.76 million yuan. Before the morning opening, the external futures market was already reported to be soaring. In addition to the Da Tong firm taking a holiday on Sunday, all the small firms and silversmiths in the four suburbs rushed to make up for the previous deficits. Bids on the grey market had already soared to over 1.8 million. At the official opening, it was around 1.8 million. After the opening, it was bid up to over 1.85 million before pressure appeared, and bulls also sold off. Securities firms took profits, gradually falling. Around 10 o'clock, it hovered around 1.77 million for a long time, forming a tug-of-war. The Central Bank then allotted 56 bars to the industry at a price of 1.76 million. After the allotment was completed, speculation revived, and it once rose to over 1.8 million. However, the US dollar did not follow suit, causing arbitrage selling, and it once fell back to 1.73 million. At noon, there were still buyers active, taking advantage of the banks' lunch break to push the market price up to 1.83 million. The Central Bank applied pressure again, and it retreated to within 1.8 million. However, it still stood outside 1.8 million in the end. As a result, it rose again by 100,000 compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry was listed at 192,000, silver ingots at 1,700, and silver dollars were sold at 1,090 yuan. Shadow interest rates were slightly looser, with interest rates ranging from 1.6 to 2 cents.

### Banks Have Abundant Supply, US Dollar Unable to Rise - Heavy Atmosphere of Hong Kong Dollar Devaluation

The US dollar was being sold high by US merchant banks, not as sharp as gold. The arbitrage spread against gold opened to over 760 yuan. At the morning opening, it was at 2,450 yuan to 2,500 yuan, but soon fell steadily. Although importers had settlements to prepare for use, they were helpless against the continuous supply from US banks and finally could not hold on, retreating to within 2,300 yuan. At noon, the gold market revived, the arbitrage spread opened too much, causing arbitrage buying, and it rose again to around 2,350 yuan. The afternoon situation was stable, hovering outside 2,300 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar was initially affected by gold and silver, once seeing a high price of 440 yuan. Finally, due to heavy news of Hong Kong dollar devaluation and loose Hong Kong exchange rates, it fell again. As a result, it retreated by 5 yuan, with Hong Kong exchange rates at 420 yuan and rupees at 520 yuan, all being sold. The US exchange rate was flat and stagnant.

### Large Investors Intervene, Government Bonds Turn Around

Government bonds turned volatile after rising yesterday. The environment was unfavorable midway. Unified Class C fell from 7,100 yuan to around 6,350 yuan. After the bulls were almost completely slaughtered, large firms in the industry began to buy in, rising to around 7,150 yuan. Northern buyers took profits and exchanged gold for bonds, and the situation changed. The midday closing resulted in a rise of 250 compared to the previous closing. Classes A, B, and D were all flat, and Class E rose slightly by 100 yuan.

### Yarn Market Running Dry - Hot Items Fangjian Not Yet on Sale

The yarn market situation yesterday was calm at the beginning. News then spread that Tianjin buyers were competing to handle fine yarn, and because gold continued to soar, buying revived at the time of the clouds. It was also heard that Fangjian Company happened to be at the time of opening yarn, planning to sell 26 types of yarn of all grades, mostly 10-count and 60/80 and 100 fine yarns. 42-count and 32-count hot items were not yet included, so the supply of chips on the market became increasingly dry. Therefore, the situation became increasingly tight. As a result, 42-count Shuiyue and 20-count Baizhu Boat brands each rose by 560,000, and the remaining yarns rose by 120,000. Cloth merchants and door shops were still enthusiastic about grey light twill, and the price rose again by more than 1,000. The fortunes of other brands varied. The price of New American cotton in the flower market rose by 2 to 17 pounds. The near-term US dollar was 27.40, the far-term was 27.95, and the current spot price of Metrelin was 28.20. The current spot cotton transaction in this port was normal, with only Zhongxin First Factory and its peers slightly improving. The remaining factories remained on the sidelines.

### Hemp Market Flat

Before the war, hemp was mainly sold to Europe. Since August 13th, exports have been hindered, and domestic transportation has not been smooth, so the source in this port has been interrupted. After the victory, arrivals have not been smooth. There have been only a few arrivals this spring, only one-tenth or two-tenths compared to the previous arrivals and sales. Recently, although there have been slightly more arrivals, no foreign sales have been seen. It is only for domestic sales, and those engaged in this are not interested. The market is temporarily difficult to develop, so prices do not rise or fall much. Recently, the selling prices of each hemp shop are 65,000 yuan per shi dan for white hemp, 65,000 yuan for Yuanjiang hemp, and 60,000 yuan for Qing hemp.

### Sugar Market Shortage and Price Increase

Yesterday, the sugar market suddenly rose due to the shortage of spot goods and more demand.

Other miscellaneous goods also followed suit. The opening price of Diao Qing was very chaotic in the morning, with thousands of yuan coming in and out. The official market price was in the range of 48,000 yuan, and it rose to 50,000 yuan in the afternoon. It rose 45,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Securities Firms Withdraw Gold to Exchange for Stocks - Market Gradually Turns from Fatigue to Stability

The stock market continued to be unstable, advancing and retreating suddenly.

Yongsha fell from 5,030 yuan to 4,750 yuan, Meiya fell from 4,150 yuan to 3,880 yuan, Jingfu fell from 340 yuan to 325 yuan, Xinguang fell from 290 yuan to 268 yuan, and Qinxing fell from 240 yuan to 225 yuan. They all rose slightly at noon. Securities firms filled shorts, withdrew gold to exchange for stocks, so the hot situation gradually stabilized, and small stocks still felt lagging. The results were slightly higher for Yongsha Meiya compared to the previous closing. Other stocks all fell except for Zhongfang Match. Only Yongsha Meiya traded overnight in the afternoon, and the bids continued to rise. Foreign stocks were also tired and stable at first. There were many trades midway, with Yisha in and out of the 1,300 mark, showing a tug-of-war. The results of each stock were similar to last Saturday, but Yisha rose slightly in the afternoon, while Meilian and others fell slightly.

### Silk is All Sought After

Yesterday's City 120 Tianqiao had Guang Renzao silk, opening at 1.39 million yuan, with the minimum at 1.36 million yuan, and closing at 380,000 yuan. The afternoon price was 1.4 million yuan, resulting in a large increase of 670,000 yuan compared to last weekend. 75 Golden Rooster semi-gloss, goods were scarce and sought after, and the price was also very good. Affected by the rise in gold prices, the price of factory silk has increased by about 50,000 yuan in each grade. The market price of silk fabrics has also followed, with Wan Ya quilt cover at 70,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and Da Cheng plaid crepe at 4,130 yuan per yard, 300 yuan higher than last weekend. The price of Sheng goods was also shouting up by 1,000 yuan.

### Niliu Cloth Sales Uneven

Nirong sales have been sluggish for the past few weeks. Although there are a few small customer groups, they are all scattered. The various groups in this street regret that it is difficult to take action at such a high price, and since the Western clothing tailoring groups are on strike, the way out has been reduced by half. However, khaki fabrics of yellow and green colors are quite popular in the current sales market, and both Beijing and Hangzhou have a large number of searches. Each yard ranges from 1,5600 yuan to 3,000 yuan. In view of the lack of goods circulation, most of them are purchasing white blanks for dyeing. For example, the Nanjing gang all used light yellow rainproof cloth instead, and more than 10,000 yards have been shipped one after another.

### Extracting Green Tea of 700 Crates: First Shipment to India Last Week

It has been observed that before the war, Bombay, India, had a considerable annual export of Chinese tea. However, after the victory, due to transportation issues, no shipments had been made. It is now learned from sources there that there is a current demand for Choungong green tea. To meet this urgent need, Ruichang Foreign Firm in this city shipped 700 crates as the first trial shipment last week. If there are no unforeseen problems, subsequent shipments are expected to continue steadily. It is also heard that foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson are also preparing for action. As for the tea market situation in this city, the price of Wenzhou new Qiqiang tea has softened due to a surge in arrivals and poor quality. News from Hangzhou indicates that merchants from Tianjin and Nanjing are already active in the production areas, which has boosted confidence and pushed prices higher than last week. The supply and demand for aged red and green tea are balanced, and the market sentiment is stable.

The price of Mao tea in Tunxi has plummeted. Qimen black tea has already been released to the market. It is reported that banks are wary of transporting due to frequent robberies on the Hangzhou-Anhui Road, and tea merchants are also taking a wait-and-see attitude due to sluggish tea sales in Shanghai. The purchasing price of Mao tea has fallen from 800 yuan to 200 yuan per catty, which is lower than the production cost for farmers. The picking season has passed, and tea merchants are currently processing the tea.

Observations from the UK: A dispatch from the British Information Service in London on the 13th states that "The Economist" reports: As the tea season approaches, Chinese tea merchants are striving to restore tea exports. The industry has requested substantial loans from the "Four Banks." Although tea exports are unlikely to return to the pre-war level of 80 to 100 million pounds annually, the reorganization of organized Chinese export trade is noteworthy. Tea plantations in the Dutch East Indies suffered severe damage during the war and cannot be supplied in large quantities for the time being. Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaya have no tea markets. India, Ceylon, and British East Africa have borne most of the world's tea tonnage in the past five tea seasons and are now suffering from the impact of excessive picking in the past and insufficient fertilization. Therefore, it is currently imperative to increase the production of war-torn tea sources.

The Chinese government believes that if a market can be found, China can still export approximately 200 million pounds of tea. The reason for the sharp decline in the world's demand for Chinese tea in the past decade is that the Chinese tea industry is lagging behind India, Ceylon, and the Dutch East Indies in production methods. Therefore, the Chinese government is preparing a major improvement plan, which is timely but may take several years to fully take effect.

At the same time, the Dutch East Indies and other Eastern tea exporting countries may gradually restore their pre-war export volumes. Against this background, the Chinese tea export movement will inevitably encounter difficulties and friction. The future trend of world tea consumption cannot be estimated at present. It is also possible that the world tea supply may exceed demand in a few years. If this is the case, international cooperation will inevitably resume, and China will also be included.

### American and British Paint Merchants: Temporary Suspension of Orders

American merchants such as Nanxing, Hengxin, and Jishi, and British merchants such as Brunner Mond & Co., who promoted paints in China before the war, have now resumed business in China, selling spot goods and accepting pre-orders. It is understood that each company has received many orders in the past six months. However, due to the fact that the manufacturing equipment of the paint factories in the UK and the US is in the initial stages of restoration (major paint factories were converted to produce military chemicals during the war), coupled with the strike wave in the US, current production is limited. Each company in Shanghai has now received telegrams from their domestic factories and headquarters to temporarily suspend accepting orders. The orders that have already been accepted will be gradually completed by the winter of this year.

### US Chamber of Commerce Holds: Foreign Trade Week, Actively Developing Foreign Trade

[Dispatch from the US Information Service, Washington, December 12] The US Chamber of Commerce announced on the 8th that it has sent letters to community organizations across the US, inviting them to participate in the Foreign Trade Week from May 19 to 25. Foreign Trade Week includes Maritime Day on the 22nd, which commemorates the first US ship traversing the Atlantic Ocean in 1918. The Chamber of Commerce calls on all parties to actively develop foreign trade this year. President Truman has said that this year is "a decisive year." The Chamber points out that one of the important plans this year is to convene an international trade conference to discuss the establishment of an international trade organization. This proposed organization will be a worldwide organization to promote international trade. The primary task of developing international trade is to rebuild the peacetime merchant fleet and establish international airlines. The Chamber of Commerce continued: Congress is currently studying legislation on trade agreements between the United States and more than fourteen countries, which is a clear demonstration of the United States' emphasis on international trade.

### After Taiwan's Return to China: Changes in Far East Sugar Supply, China's Consumption Will Increase Greatly

(Reuters, London, December 13) Czarnikow Ltd. published an article reviewing the world sugar situation, stating that Taiwan's return to China has completely changed the Far East's sugar supply situation. Due to the lack of sugarcane and fertilizers, it will take some time for Taiwan to resume sugar exports. However, in the 1938-39 season, the island produced 1,356,000 tons of sugar, almost all of which was exported to Japan. Japan's domestic sugar production is only 45,000 tons per year, while its demand reaches 1,149,000 tons. In the future, Japan may not be able to restore its pre-war sugar consumption level of 24 pounds per person per year. China's sugar consumption will increase significantly. Before the war, due to the low purchasing power of the Chinese people, each person consumed only 4 pounds of sugar per year. Even after absorbing all of Taiwan's sugar, its consumption level will still be lower than that of Europeans.

### Under Close Attention from All Parties: Rice Prices Stopped Advancing Yesterday, Grain Merchants Going to Production Areas to Purchase, Association Certificate Allows Passage

Yesterday, both arrivals and sales in the rice market were weak. Both Japonica and Indica rice fell by slightly less than 1,000 yuan. However, the price of early thin rice and Baiyuan rice from the South Road remained unchanged. Sales of flour in other provinces weakened, and the local market followed suit with a wait-and-see attitude. Prices were firm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon, with no gains or losses. Soybean cake and bran showed little fluctuation. High-quality soybeans fell by 1,000 yuan, while medium and low quality soybeans remained unchanged. Mung beans from Southeast Asia were selectively bought at high prices, and the price was higher for better quality beans. The same was true for sesame, with high-quality sesame being popular and lower-quality sesame remaining stable. Raw peanuts were similar. The corn market in Qingdao moved but was not strong, and the market situation was stable. Red sorghum rose by 1,000 yuan. Sales in Shantou were balanced, with no immediate changes. It is heard that Brazilian foreign rice is also under negotiation, with a price of 30,000 yuan per stone. According to rice market information, yesterday's rice arrivals in this city totaled over 6,000 stones. The types and quantities of rice are as follows: 3,125 stones of white Japonica rice, 917 stones of thin rice, 950 stones of early rice, 40 stones of Yang Indica rice, 714 stones of Du Indica rice, 365 stones of Wu Indica rice, 35 stones of Baiyuan rice, and 30 stones of Yinyuan rice.

[Report from this newspaper] A large amount of Wuhu rice will arrive in port soon, transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company motorized sailing vessels. It is heard that one ship is carrying more than 1,000 bags and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.

### Association Issues: Grain Merchant Purchase and Transport Permits

Another report: Pang Songzhou, Deputy Minister of Food, came to Shanghai last week to handle emergency measures for food administration. After discussing the issue of food regulation with relevant authorities, it was agreed that grain merchants would be allowed to travel to rice producing areas for purchasing without restrictions. Therefore, the merchants were urged to begin group purchasing immediately. All grain merchants traveling to rice producing areas for purchasing only need a certificate from the industry association to transport rice to Shanghai as much as possible. The Grain and Rice Association of this city, under orders to process transport permits for grain merchants, officially began issuing them yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The original text is as follows: "It is hereby reported by our member, Mr./Ms. ____, that they intend to purchase rice in the following areas to transport to Shanghai to support the food supply for the people. A request for a certificate has been received, and it is found to be consistent with the facts. Therefore, this certificate is issued with the hope that military police along the way will inspect and release. This certificate includes the following information: purchasing area, product name, quantity, destination. This is for receipt by member ____ company." Furthermore, to prevent abuse, it has been stipulated that this certificate is valid for only half a month and will expire afterwards.

### Rice Loan: Trial Run Ends After One Month

Regarding the handling of rice loans, the Food Administration Department announced yesterday that the loan amount decided for grain merchants was 1 billion yuan, and the actual amount loaned out was 940 million yuan. The grain merchants who received the loans purchased rice in Jiangsu and Anhui, which arrived in port continuously. This coincided with rising grain prices in various places, allowing the grain merchants to earn substantial profits in a short period of time, which led to the disturbances in the rice market in this city on the 19th of last month. Therefore, the department announced the suspension of sales of all rice that had arrived in port and was purchased with loans, pending discussion and resolution by the Loan Review Subcommittee. The subcommittee held its third meeting on the 10th and decided to hand over the rice purchased with loans that was already in warehouses to the Grain and Rice Industry Association for sale on the rice market in batches. The price would be slightly lower than the market price. As for the profits earned by the loan merchants, the Food Administration Department will require the loan merchants to submit report forms and receipts for review and then report to the meeting to decide on the handling methods. It was also decided that the grain merchant loan trial run would end after one month, and all loan merchants would be notified to return both the principal and interest to the bank.

### Lumber Arrives in Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new ship, Deng Keng, made its first voyage to Fuzhou and returned to Shanghai yesterday, carrying a full load of lumber, totaling more than 25,000 pieces. The size of the pieces is unknown.

### American Pig Bristle Association: Telegram Requests Revision of Sizes

[Tianjin News] After the victory, the quality of pig bristles exported from Tianjin to the United States was low and did not meet the standards. The New York Pig Bristle Association and the New York American Brush Manufacturing Association jointly telegraphed the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, stipulating the pig bristle manufacturing methods and size standards. The following is a translated excerpt from the telegram: We hereby represent our country's importers and users in telegrahically requesting your Chamber of Commerce to pay attention to the reform of the size of exported pig bristles to meet the standards. The measurement of 2.2 inches is 40%, 2.5 inches is 70%, and 2.75 inches or more is 80%. The minimum size is 2.25 inches. The total length of the bristles in the bundle must be an additional eighth of an inch (i.e., if the bristle bundle is two and a quarter inches, the bundle must be two and three-eighths inches long).

### A Journey to Taitung: On the Edge of the Pacific Ocean

— A Maritime Dispatch from This Newspaper on the 8th: By Mu Yun, Special Correspondent in Taiwan

In Taiwan, people enjoy going to Taipei or taking a stroll in the central and southern regions, while Taitung is regarded as a daunting destination. The main reason is determined by the geographical environment. To the west, north, and south of the Central Mountain Range, there are vast plains, flat terrain, and abundant agricultural products, as well as Taiwan's specialties of tea, matting, bananas, and watermelons. However, in Taitung, apart from the beach along the Pacific Ocean, there is a strip-like plain where rice is grown. The rest is filled with peaks and hills, inhabited by the local Taiwanese and the indigenous people who live in the mountains. Contact with the outside world is limited, and transportation is difficult, all of which are facts.

The most important purpose of this trip for the reporter, from Taipei to Taitung, is not only to widely delve into the various classes of this province, but also to investigate the political facilities of the authorities after the takeover. I also want to see what depth it has advanced in the remote corners of the villages on the edge of this barren East Pacific Ocean. Of course, the beautiful scenery is also what the reporter is pursuing.

Moving Through the Mining Area

From the provincial capital to Su'ao, there is only one connecting train each day, not in Keelung, but at Badu, an intersection less than one stop away from Keelung. The reporter and two others boarded the 11:17 am train, and at 12:25 pm, we turned into the Eastern Line and sat down on the peeling-skinned seats. After criticism from all parties and the determination of the officials to reform, the chaotic transportation situation in Taiwan has been adjusted. Trains run on time, soldiers buy tickets, and queue up to stamp their tickets. However, demanding the prompt repair and renovation of the train carriages is still a tall order because the heat wave of over 80 degrees makes it difficult for passengers trapped in the carriages to breathe even with fans. Poor quality smoke billowed onto our faces and collars like rain. The train passed through the foothills and mountainsides, with more than forty tunnels allowing the train to pass. We did not have time to count them in detail, but we only felt that we were not tourists but miners, like those described by Sinclair, in the hundreds of miles of continuous mining area.

This line is truly a mining area. Nuan Nuan's coal, Sijiaoting, and Ruifang's coal mines are the best and most productive. Ruifang's Jinguashi Mine is a famous place. The mining area covers 5,510,000 ping. Thirteen years ago, the annual production of gold reached 1,481 kilograms, silver 4,394 kilograms, and copper 3,025,000 kilograms. Houtong and Wudankeng stations also produce coal, and it is smokeless coal. At Dali Jian Station, you can see the boundless ocean. Among the beautiful and unique rock formations, passing Daxi, you can see Turtle Mountain, which is 4.9 kilometers away from the land on the ocean surface.

Yilan and Luodong are rainy. In the rain, if it weren't for the ocean, this area could easily remind one that this was originally a fiery land of Jiangnan. Near the train station, there is a continuous stretch of villages, tile houses and thatched huts, melon sheds and vegetable gardens, simple fences, pomegranate flowers, and herdsmen wearing bamboo hats leading water buffaloes on the coal-filled highway. Rows of rice fields lie quietly on the foothills. You can deeply feel that "the scenery of Jiangnan is the same everywhere."

At 3:30 pm, we arrived at the end of the Yilan Line - Su'ao. The whole journey is about the distance from Shanghai to Hangzhou, taking four hours. The second-class connecting ticket costs 48 Taiwan dollars.

Su'ao Night Talk

Su'ao is not only a small town in Taitung, but also the smallest district in the province. The Japanese used to set up counties, but now they have been changed to district offices, under the jurisdiction of Taipei County. This is a remote mountainous area on the eastern border. The things at the edge of the town are the ocean, surrounded by mountains on the west, north, and south sides. The whole district has only more than 500 households, with a total population of 30,000. Below the district office, there is only one town office, which controls twelve villages. The simple administrative structure is probably rare in the country.

I met District Chief Xie, a graduate of the Taiwan Training Class of the Central Training Corps (I want to especially mention the Taiwan Training Class of the Central Training Corps, because most of them serve as the main local administrative cadres, and the students of the Central Police Academy control the police affairs of the whole province, which are two powerful systems). He is young and talented, spending a life like squatting in a dilapidated temple, passing the days with the sound of morning bells and evening drums. He came here a month ago, and the unfortunate riot incident that occurred last month made him feel discouraged and unwilling to continue! He told the reporter that at 2:30 am on March 20, a fire broke out in the district office. The cause was that the workers, to practice the customs of the province and afraid of earthquakes, started a fire for sacrifice, and the sparks ignited. As a result, due to the lack of perfect fire-fighting equipment, they borrowed help from the Luodong Fire Brigade in the neighboring district. By the time they arrived, the quadrangle district office of 28 ping had been reduced to ashes, and the 40-ping house had been demolished. The accurate estimate is that the loss is more than 3.59 million Taiwan dollars. This cannot be said to be just the misfortune of the district office, but the great misfortune of the 121,000 people in Su'ao District. All the documents withdrawn by Japanese expatriates and the public affairs of the past fifty years were destroyed. At the same time as the disaster, the volunteer police team caused trouble again, resulting in the district chief being beaten and kicked. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the higher-ups, and the perpetrator was taken to the county police station. After the volunteer police team was disbanded, eight of the ringleaders were imprisoned in the Garrison Command. This storm attracted the attention of people all over the province, especially this "planned" "mass riot," which opened a new page in the history of Taiwan's reconstruction.

The district chief continued, "Now a company of the National Army, as well as artillery, is responsible for maintaining law and order, which is very quiet." Then he sighed, "The ringleaders of the fire are said to have been released on bail... I am no matter what, unwilling to continue doing this!"

On the edge of the ocean in the desolate mountain village, we spent a night. The next morning, it was a sunny day, and we took a car to Hualien Port for eight yuan, heading to Dong'ao.

Su'ao can be said to have no market. Various strange fish are produced along the ocean: squid, flying fish, tuna, marlin, fins, mackerel, and sharks with fins famous in the mainland. South of the port, digging a T-shaped Southern Australia with a water depth of 23 meters is an excellent fishing port. At one time, when commodity prices in Shanghai and Taiwan were not yet balanced, this was the best smuggling port, but now there is less smuggling, because there are no goods to export that can make money. However, there are many travelers here, and those going to Hualien Port must stay overnight before taking a car. The total distance is 120 kilometers. In early April, due to the terrain, a section 45 kilometers away from Hualien collapsed, requiring a 45-minute walk. Originally, there were four cars running in each direction every day, but now it has been changed to two.

The Road Along the Sea

Because we wanted to see the beautiful scenery along the edge of the Pacific Ocean and visit a small sugar factory, we spent an hour arriving at Dong'ao, which has a population of only 1,000 people. The highway is carved into a single-lane road on the side of the mountain. The car is traveling close to the cliff, with an S-shaped bend every two or three seconds. Looking out the window, on one side is a verdant mountain within reach, mountains connecting mountains, mountains surrounding mountains, and mountains encircling mountains. There are white clouds on the top of the mountain, white clouds in love with the mountain, and the clear sky is above the mountain. On the other side is a deep valley with towering cliffs, overlapping strange rocks, and the azure Pacific Ocean kissing it tightly. Sitting in the carriage, imagining what kind of magical place it would be, one cannot understand it without personally experiencing it. You must love the majestic and magnificent beauty of the high mountains and the vast ocean, but you must also deeply feel that this is an adventurous and beautiful journey. The Japanese praised this as one of the eight scenic spots in Taiwan. I feel that the steep Stevenson Highway in China is not as beautiful because it has no ocean or turbulent waves.

I understand more about how the Japanese exhausted their efforts. From the fifth year of Taisho to April of the sixth year of Showa, it took fifteen years, costing 5 million yen, and sacrificing fifty-eight people to build this road of struggle, connecting the traffic of eastern Taiwan. From the road surface engineering and the construction of bridges between mountains, I would never have dreamed that fifty-one years later, it would still return to China. I praise the greatness of the coastal road, the greatness of controlling nature, but I cannot help but sigh to the sky for the political shortsightedness and the arrogance of the Japanese warlords! The vitality of life is more vibrant here. I believe this is the greatest beauty in the East!

Returning, we lay on the straw mat, recalling this journey, feeling lingering fear and aftertaste.

### Eight Years of Struggle in Kunming · Imminent Return North: Southwest Associated University Erects a Monument

— Special Dispatch from Kunming, 7th (via airmail) by Correspondent Zhang Shengli

The Southwest Associated University, which began and ended with the War of Resistance, concluded operations in Kunming on "May Fourth". Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University will soon relocate back to Beijing and Tianjin, to resume their former endeavors. From their southward migration to their northward return, nearly nine autumns will have passed. The past events of this university are recountable, and our memories are still fresh. We recount its general outline, to serve as a reference.

Speaking of Southwest Associated University, there is no shortage of both praise and criticism. Opinions vary, and this reporter will refrain from taking a position. However, its hardships and achievements have left a "monument of five-colored splendor" in wartime higher education.

Old Wounds and New Pains Compete and Torment

Most of the students at the Associated University came from war zones, faced financial difficulties, and lived hard lives. The high cost of living in Kunming was often the highest in the country. They lived under a "hump"-like cost of living index and relied on loans, work-study programs, and part-time jobs to complete their studies. With inadequate clothing and footwear, proper daily nutrition was out of the question. With both physical and mental distress, it was even more difficult to strengthen the atmosphere of research. In the early days after the Associated University arrived in Kunming, many students held teaching positions in various schools. This later expanded to various organizations and groups, and then to factories and homes. However, because there were more monks than porridge, many were left empty-handed. Some even worked part-time firing the midday gun in Kunming. Although this was passed on as a fine anecdote, the intention was indeed earnest. This kind of all-pervasive part-time work made them more aware of the dark side of urban life. Old wounds and new pains intertwined in the minds and bodies of young people. Moreover, in the highest institutions of learning, with freedom of speech, association, and research, they were idealistic about the future, sensitive to the present, and not easily forgetting the past. Therefore, there were often cries of injustice and voices of righteousness, expressed in wall posters, gatherings, or propaganda marches. It is likely that the mixed reputation stems from this. The so-called "Associated University students are fond of meddling" can probably be explained in this way. As for politically motivated activities with ulterior motives, we will not discuss them here.

Wearing Western Suits, Looking Like Important Officials

The Faculty of Arts and Law of the Associated University was initially established in Mengzi, southern Yunnan. When they arrived, local soldiers, seeing them in Western suits, suspected that they were important officials from the central government and often stood at attention and saluted them. The county produced rattan canes, which were inexpensive and of good quality. Each student of the Associated University had one, which further enhanced their "important official" demeanor. The female students of the university took the route through Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Haiphong to enter Yunnan. The exotic and glamorous clothes they brought from Hong Kong astonished the local people. Some mischievous children even surrounded the female students and peered inside their cheongsams to see if they were wearing trousers underneath. The atmosphere can be imagined. The female dormitory was rented from the residence of the wealthiest Zhou family in the area. Their study room was outside the city. Every night, when the female students walked back to the dormitory in groups, they were escorted by armed school police to avoid being mocked by frivolous individuals. The prices there were very low, the scenery was quite good, and the people lived very leisurely lives. The teachers and students of the Associated University, having escaped the threat of gunfire, entered this quiet and beautiful realm. Some felt quite troubled by the quiet. Before the Battle of Wuhan, the female students in the "ivory tower" left behind a relative in Mengzi. Some said, "This is to celebrate the opening of the Associated University."

Speaking of the eight years of life for the students of the Associated University in Kunming, there is naturally no shortage of elegant and anecdotal stories, but many of them are tragedies, comedies, and farces. When they first arrived in Kunming, they were unfamiliar with the local customs. When male and female students walked hand-in-hand and shoulder-to-shoulder through the city, the police regarded it as damaging to public morals and punished them by slapping their palms in the street. This was a "comedy." There were also cases of male and female students committing suicide by poisoning themselves due to love problems. This was a tragedy. When the Associated University was first established, the school buildings were narrow and there were few electric lights. Students had no place to study, so they went to teahouses in groups to copy notes, do exercises, play bridge, or chat in circles, talking and arguing loudly, as if there was no one else around. Those who whispered quietly seemed to be sitting in a secret room. Within one room, each had their own world. Across one table, the activity and silence were completely different. Although the number of teahouses on Fengzhu Street and Wenlin Street increased greatly due to demand, in the past, there were no learned scholars coming and going, and the customers were all students. The business was light and the profits were very meager. As for those who were in love, most of them were cheap social gatherings, eating a bowl of rice noodles or two baked cakes with relish, and both the man and woman were delighted. Naturally, there was no shortage of farces among them.

The Germination of Points, The Spread of Lines

After the reopening of the Burma Road, the atmosphere in Kunming changed dramatically. Later, with the arrival of American troops in Kunming and frequent airlifts between China and India, the cost of living in Kunming became increasingly expensive and extravagant. This deepened the threats and troubles for the students of the Associated University in both spirit and material terms. Brokers and the "international route" gradually spread from the germination of points into the spread of lines. The students of the Associated University were not all saintly and virtuous – although the number was very small – and the words of insinuation from the outside world also made it difficult for those who cherished the spirit of the Associated University to distinguish whether it was a "groundless accusation." The students of the Associated University believed that this was a scandal for the school and launched a drum-beating attack against the "international route" within the school. Cold ridicule and heated scolding, leaflets everywhere, and the trend gradually subsided.

After the start of the counter-offensive in western Yunnan, the dance craze gradually rose in Kunming, and is now too prevalent. In private dance parties, one can often see students of the Associated University, but very few enter commercial dance halls. Near the female dormitories of the school, one can sometimes see Jeeps picking up and dropping off dance partners, which is only enough to attract the attention of ordinary people, and rarely leads to excessive speculation. As for the brokers among the male students, although they are not generally noticed, they are also very troubled when discussing this matter. The targets of the brokers are mostly American soldiers and related personnel. The items traded are mostly buying and selling US dollars, American military supplies, and Chinese specialties or native products. Such individuals, even in the last two years of the Associated University, accounted for only one or two percent.

Several Alarms a Day During Air Raids

Before 1941, the scope of student activities at the Associated University mostly focused on the campus. The characteristics of that time were ball games, wall posters, lectures, and seminars. Old Peking University students, although not interested in sports, often told each other, "Only physical education cannot be careless." This was thanks to their love for Tsinghua. At that time, students from North China, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Southeast Asia had a strong interest in sports and were also more skilled. Under the leadership of Professor Ma Dehan, they often won championships in the city sports meets. When the situation in the Burma battlefield became tense, Kunming was threatened by air raids. Not only did extracurricular activities on campus become silent as a result, but the time for going to school was also changed to mornings and evenings. With several alarms a day, the emotions of teachers and students were quite uneasy. After the arrival of American troops in China, hundreds of students from the Associated University served as translators. Later, they responded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's call and enthusiastically joined the Youth Army. The spirit of the Associated University was once again invigorated. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the country still faced many difficulties. The Associated University also had many troubles. The most prominent was the "Kunming Student Movement." In the past half year, students of the Associated University were still often seen in the city acting as newspaper boys, distributing or selling their own propaganda. The Dean of Students of the school, Cha Liangzhao, felt "wanting to cry but having no tears" at this point!

Three Standing Committee Members, Close as Siblings

The Associated University began its operations in Kunming on "May Fourth" in 1938 and concluded its operations in Kunming on "May Fourth" in 1946. Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University had different histories and different academic styles, but they were able to support each other through hardships for eight years, cooperating seamlessly. This must be attributed to the faculty and staff of the Associated University, especially the three leaders – Jiang Menglin, Mei Yi-qi, and Zhang Boling. Some people regard the Associated University as a large family, and the three standing committee members as three siblings. Standing Committee Member Jiang handled diplomacy, Standing Committee Member Mei managed domestic affairs, and Standing Committee Member Zhang was stationed in the accompanying capital, Chongqing, to handle liaison. Those who handled foreign affairs were open-minded, and those who managed domestic affairs were able to consolidate. They advised each other and complemented each other. Although Peking University was the cradle of the "May Fourth" spirit, the newly born Associated University was still like the large family before and after the "May Fourth" Movement, with inevitable contradictions between new and old ideas. When Standing Committee Member Jiang spoke to teachers and students, he mentioned Mr. Science first, and then Mr. Democracy. This was still the path that the "May Fourth" Movement strived for. Therefore, in this large family, even if there were those who "defied the consensus of the crowd and spoke frankly like a scholar," they were ultimately able to be inclusive, "agreeing without harming difference, and differing without harming agreement." The so-called spirit of the Associated University probably lies in this. The reason why the Associated University was able to harmonize for eight years without splitting up is probably due to this as well.

Through Wind and Rain, Ascending Steep Peaks

Speaking of the lives of the faculty and staff of the Associated University, in the past eight years, they were not walking on asphalt roads, watching the clouds with those who shared the nation's troubles, but were shouldering the same tasks as the soldiers, climbing steep peaks in wind and rain. Their so-called material livelihood, besides eating chalk dust, was mostly selling articles, writing, engraving seals, special lectures, or selling old clothes, or borrowing from relatives and friends. There were very few who had special solutions. Their so-called spiritual food, besides a portion of books surviving the disaster, sometimes could only be used as fruit to appreciate the relics of American military culture. Even if the professors felt that the pressure on their bodies and minds was too high in this situation, they rarely put down the teaching whip that served as a walking stick. Rather than living for today, they were moving forward for tomorrow. This also sufficiently demonstrates the spirit of the Associated University.

Monument Erected at the Time of Graduation

Regarding the spirit and life of the Associated University, what this reporter knows is brief and not detailed, so he can only provide a superficial report. On the day of the school's graduation, a monument was erected on the campus. The inscription was written by Professor Feng Youlan and can be considered a historical document. Here, we quote a passage from the monument inscription as a conclusion to this article, which reads:

"Grieving the southward crossing, we bid farewell to the palace walls. Stationed in Hengzhou, we parted again. Continuing the long march, we circled around steep mountains. Looking towards the Central Plains, blood was shed everywhere. Arriving at the distant border, we continued to lecture. With books lost, we used our tongues. Despite all the hardships, our feelings grew stronger. The shame of a thousand autumns has finally been avenged. Seeing the enemy, they vanished like smoke. Rising from the north, reaching to the south. Seeing the golden goblet, there is no more defect. Great unity, without collapse or break. The revival of the nation, continuing the great achievements of the past. The three schools, are brothers in order. As one body, like glued together. Sharing hardships, sharing joys. The joint mission is completed. The divine capital is restored, returning to Yan and Jie. With this stone, symbolizing unwavering integrity. Commemorating the auspicious celebration, telling future generations! (Sent from Kunming on May 7th)

### Zhenjiang Warehouse: Allowing Materials to be Sealed Up and Rot, Many Refugees Grieve Over Lack of Food and Clothing

— Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 8th, by Tao

Recently, Zhenjiang, from all aspects, seems to be outwardly calm, but inwardly tense. Speaking of a time further back, it has been gradually mobilizing since the fire at the gunpowder depot of the Logistics Department. First, the time for curfews began to be brought forward, followed by intensified household checks, and now all important strongholds have been fortified. By late at night, the streets are deserted, and the river surface is under curfew, starting before dusk in the afternoon. No ships are allowed to dock. Yangzhou can be considered the gateway to Zhenjiang, and it is now also under intensified guard. Even refugees who previously had refugee certificates have now lost their validity and cannot enter the city gates. Ships coming from the north are only allowed to go to Wantou, where they must dock, be inspected, and then proceed on foot. This is not only the case for the National Army, but it is said that the Communist Army is also different from before. In the past, it seemed that people were allowed to pass freely, and carrying a few pieces of luggage was not a big problem. Now, however, it is not only impossible to bring luggage, but even some spare clothes require some persuasion. Sometimes, even a letter is on the list of prohibited items.

People Are Restless, Rumors Rise and Fall

Due to the above facts and movements, people with slightly simpler minds cannot help but panic. The situation has a feeling of "a storm is brewing." In fact, the defenses around Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are very solid. People who are oversensitive always end up troubling themselves. However, we cannot generalize and arbitrarily blame everything. That is because the rumors from the outside world have been particularly increasing in the past half month. Whether someone is deliberately spreading them is another matter. For example, the fire at the gunpowder depot was clearly due to the embers of a match igniting gasoline, resulting in a large explosion in the warehouse. However, rumors always believe that there must be a reason, and even believe that it was a planned action. A pistol was found on a refugee, and rumors say it was a light machine gun. Clearly there was only one, but rumors always say it was a large batch. Such rumors, people in Zhenjiang are certainly unsure, and they have even been spread to Shanghai. Several newspapers have even telegraphed, instructing reporters stationed in Zhenjiang to investigate seriously. In fact, it is basically just that one thing, where else could there be anything? However, once it reaches a certain point in time, it will dissipate like the wind, collapsing without being attacked.

Nantong and Yangzhou, The Situation Remains Peaceful

A few days ago, the situation in Nantong was once tense, but after a few days, it turned from danger to safety. This is because the Communist Army often talks about these places in their propaganda, and it has always been the case. After a long period of peace, the sudden news of tension in Tongzhou cannot but attract attention. Especially Yangzhou, because in today's Grand Canal line, the only remaining one is this one county of Yangzhou. Plus, less than ten miles from Yangzhou is the front line of the Communist Army. The people of Zhenjiang care about the problem of Yangzhou even more than they care about the safety of Zhenjiang. According to rumors from people who have come, Nantong is now as quiet as usual, and the defenses of Yangzhou are also very strong. However, it has troubled the general refugees. Now, it is difficult to get convenience everywhere, and it has become a situation where the good and bad are not distinguished. Without a shop guarantee, it is impossible to enter the city. All the ships from Gaoyou and other counties in northern Jiangsu mostly take Yangzhou as their destination. Now that traffic is obstructed, they must dock and disembark passengers more than ten miles away. As for transporting goods, it is even more out of the question now.

However, although the refugees are so struggling with food and clothing, the warehouses of materials sealed by the government are allowed to rot naturally. It is truly heartbreaking to speak of. There are more than a hundred warehouses of enemy and puppet materials received in Zhenjiang, both large and small. Among them, the main eighteen have been sealed since last year until now, which is nearly half a year or more. The Logistics Department has only recently completed the inspection, with the items being more than 33,000 kilograms of barley, more than 10,000 kilograms of wheat bran, more than 20,000 kilograms of soybeans, more than 3,000 kilograms of refined rice, more than 20,000 kilograms of glutinous rice, more than 4,000 kilograms of biscuits, more than 19,000 kilograms of millet, and more than 34,000 kilograms of salt. Unfortunately, these huge numbers have been largely ruined by the words "mold and rot". After mold and rot, they are equivalent to becoming a waste product, with no use whatsoever. There are also clothing and miscellaneous items, which have also rotted due to dampness from being sealed for a long time. From the outside, they still seem to be not bad, but in reality, there is a loss of more than 70%. If these materials had been taken out earlier to provide relief to refugees, how practical and essential it would have been! However, until now, would it be better to let the sealed materials rot, and never come to a prior agreement to handle things, what can be done about it?

Relief Association Requests Allocation for Relief

The Post-War Relief Association of the counties of northern Jiangsu in Zhenjiang has specifically submitted a praiseworthy memorial requesting that the sealed materials be allocated for the relief of refugees. From this memorial, we can see the current situation of northern Jiangsu on the one hand, and the tragic state of the refugees on the other. The original text is:

"We, the Post-War Relief Association of the counties of northern Jiangsu, have jointly formed an organization to assist the service agencies of Jiangsu Province in handling the relief work for refugees from northern Jiangsu. Recently, we have continued to hear from refugees from northern Jiangsu that the Communist Army is more destructive to northern Jiangsu than floods and fierce beasts. Since the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, the situation has become even more severe, with persecution of gentry, coercion of able-bodied men, killing of intellectuals, and confiscation of land and livestock. In their search for food, there is the "eating-up team." In their destruction of houses, there is the "sweeping-clean team." In their elimination of dissidents, there is the "assassination team." In their entertainment of soldiers, there is the "women's team." In their restriction of food and prohibition of movement, there are the "smell-searching team" and the "patrol team." All able-bodied men of appropriate age are enlisted as militiamen or logistics teams to be used by them, and young children are formed into children's teams for strict training. Every household has no grain left, and everyone is homeless, with no place to find shelter. In the villages and towns occupied by the Communist Army, every day one hears the sound of gongs resounding through the clouds, implementing their poisonous tactics of struggle, forcing tenants to struggle against landlords, workers to struggle against bosses, shop assistants to struggle against shop owners, workers to struggle against factory owners, and hooligans to struggle against intellectuals, even to the point of inciting sons to struggle against fathers, wives to struggle against husbands, younger brothers to struggle against elder brothers, and younger sisters to struggle against elder sisters, resulting in death in serious cases and imprisonment in light cases. Their intention is to thoroughly break down social organization and the family system, making sure that land is confiscated for public ownership, the young and strong are drafted into the army, and the old and weak are left to die.

Today's so-called "Liberated Zone" is, when looking up, as if a killing intent shines brightly, and when looking down, it is like a plague god densely spreading. Considering that the righteous people of each county, under this unprecedented disaster, do not hesitate to give up their lives and escape from danger, thus separated from their homeland, resources are cut off, drifting in foreign lands, with no food or shelter, originally hoping that the banners would point north and they would return home one day, but the news is constantly dismal, and the date of return is uncertain, involving major military and national plans, how dare we make wild hopes. However, as refugees from all counties flock in, and the distribution of materials by relief agencies is like a drop in the bucket, some refugees still have sighs of regret. According to the province's receipt of enemy and puppet materials, sealed for use, the number is very large, enough to be used for relief of refugees, and the relief materials brought by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, piled up waiting to be released, are also not in the minority. If a few percent can be allocated to provide relief, then the thousands of refugees in northern Jiangsu will feel the grace of re-creation, and from then on, the people's morale will be restored and the kindness will be remembered for generations."

### The Complaint of the Righteous People

Mr. Editor: We are over a thousand displaced "righteous" people who have been recognized by the government for our contributions to the war effort. We have a few words and request that your esteemed newspaper allocate some space to publish them.

When the war of resistance began, both the government and the public, all patriots, including vendors and laborers, contributed money and effort to support the war. We followed the government, traveled thousands of miles, abandoned our families and businesses, and were willing to sacrifice everything, ultimately laying the foundation for victory. It cannot be said that we common people made a complete contribution, but compared to those who clung to life, feared death, acted perversely, and recognized the enemy as their father – the collaborators – we can be considered "slightly more satisfactory."

It has been ten months since the victory. All enemy and puppet assets have been seized, and the government has returned to the capital a few days ago. We ignorant common people have also been sent back home for free. However, there are still many people who cannot return home due to "poverty" and "chaos" and are gathering in various ports, "leaving everything to fate." A group of pitiful creatures who survived the war with great difficulty, though fortunate enough to be taken in and provided with food and lodging by the government, feel that spending our days in idleness, we are wasting public resources and squandering our time. Unexpectedly, recently, the relief authorities have announced a plan for on-site dispersal. The implication is that such common people are neither fit to be pillars of "nation-building" nor possess the knowledge of "democracy" to contribute to national affairs. It would be best to let us live and die on our own, and let the matter drop.

Although we have survived the calamity and endured hardship, recalling the enemy's aircraft and artillery bombardment day and night, we still have the courage to fight for survival. Is it true that after returning victorious, we will be abandoned by the government without seeking a way to live? If a dispersal order is issued or an expulsion order is given, at most, a few armed military police will be sent to enforce it.

In short, we are the sand and mud that supported the war of resistance. We risked our lives to earn the title of "righteous." Although we are not qualified to ride in cars, eat fancy food, or enjoy the inherent rights of citizens in a powerful nation, we have the right to demand that the government take both temporary and permanent measures to help us, a group of common people who have suffered from the war, are homeless, and have no ability to find work, for the sake of human survival and natural desire. For the reasons mentioned above, on April 30th, we reported to the Shanghai Branch of the Overseas Chinese Second Reception Center, requesting that the relief authorities take the following measures for us: (1) Please issue a living allowance of 10,000 yuan per person, because the center only provides food, lodging, and transportation. Other necessities, such as haircuts, bathing, shoes, and socks, are not provided. As a result, most people have long hair, dirty bodies, bare feet, and cracked skin, living in extreme hardship. Therefore, we request that a subsidy be issued to solve the above problems. (2) Request the establishment of literacy classes for school-age children, a library, a sports ground (the land is available), a club, a barbershop, a bathhouse, an obstetrics ward, and wards for acute and infectious diseases. (3) Request a separate investigation of each person's knowledge and abilities, to provide individual job introductions, or collective production. Mr. Editor, are these requests reasonable? However, since submitting the report, even though the organization is nearby, it has been delayed without approval. A few days ago, we sent representatives to make a request in person, but the bigwigs of the department refused to condescend to meet with us, and only a "specialist" gave a vague reply. After gathering to discuss, we wanted to take action to achieve our demands, but we also considered the dignity of national law and dared not be too extreme. After thinking it over, we can only write this article, requesting your esteemed newspaper to publish it quickly, to awaken the attention and assistance of the authorities and society, in the hope that we, a group of abandoned waste materials, can find a way to make a living and benefit both the public and ourselves, and avoid falling into crime and harming society.

Mr. Editor: We wholeheartedly welcome you to take the time to inspect and see if we have exaggerated. Please also ask the government on our behalf, what do they intend to do with us? Sincerely, Representatives of the Righteous People of the Second and Third Reception Centers for Overseas Chinese in the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration: Zhang Hanchao, Chen Weiru, Li Shangxun, Li Liang, Xia Rixu, Zhou Rongcheng, Cui Yaodong, Cao Shiquan, Liu Zizhou, Lu Zhizhen, Wang Fengming, Zhang Futang, Wu Jinhai, Du Yaozhang.

Additional Charges on Train Fares

Mr. Editor: Recently, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway announced the launch of a reserved-seat express train, with an additional 5,000 yuan fee per ticket for seat reservations. The passenger fare is also higher than the recently set express train price. For example, from Suzhou to Shanghai, the total cost of a first-class ticket, including the reservation fee, is over 13,000 yuan, and a second-class ticket is over 9,400 yuan. There are no third-class tickets. Compared to the prices before the increase, this is more than thirteen times higher. The term "reservation fee" is incomprehensible to the general public. Does this mean that passengers have no right to a seat at all when riding the train? If the reason is passenger congestion or the prohibition of small-scale smuggling, then each carriage has a specified number of passengers. Why not strictly regulate the number of tickets sold at each station, or add more trains? Moreover, since the overall freight transport is still not smooth, smugglers, if there is profit to be made, will continue to pursue their interests, even if the penalty is increased hundreds of times. If the Railway Bureau's expenditures are insufficient, then the increase in passenger fares will affect the price of all goods. Even if the salaries of staff members are increased, with the prices of goods and train fares rising in tandem, I fear that the Railway Bureau's income and expenses will never be balanced. Those who are responsible for this will still feel the difficulty of life. The government has repeatedly emphasized stabilizing prices as an urgent policy after returning to the capital. Why does the Railway Bureau have this superficial solution that does not address the root cause? Sincerely, Feng Yi.

Condensed Milk Rationed to Patients

Mr. Editor: I am a poor and sick civil servant. Suddenly, I heard that the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) had fish liver oil and condensed milk rationed to patients. I was naturally overjoyed, so I went to the Fourth Tuberculosis Clinic on Qiqi Road to apply according to the regulations. I originally thought it was completely free, but when registering, I learned that I still had to pay a registration fee of 500 yuan and a fluoroscopy fee of 3,000 yuan. When receiving the fish liver oil, I also had to pay a bottle fee of 1,000 yuan. Mr. Editor, don't you think this method greatly deviates from the original intention of relief? Six cans of condensed milk and two pounds of fish liver oil are worth no more than 10,000 yuan at market prices. Now I have to pay a price of 4,500 yuan. Isn't this just selling at a discount? I naturally do not object to registering and examining when applying, but the clinic's charging standards are too high! Because according to the regulations, those receiving rations must be examined once a month. For the benefit of myself and other patients, I hope that Mr. Editor will reveal this matter in your newspaper and ask the responsible authorities to review it. It would be best to cancel the procedure of monthly checkups in the future to reduce the burden on patients. If it cannot be canceled, I hope to reduce the charging standards as much as possible. Sincerely, Li Tongren.

After the Youth Army is Demobilized

Your newspaper reported that the Youth Army will be demobilized at the end of this (May). In the humble opinion of this reader, it would be best if the authorities trained some of the Youth Army comrades to become outstanding Chinese police officers. Currently, the general police force has a lower level of knowledge (and some have even served in the puppet regime). Regarding the academic qualifications of police officers, I think a health police officer should fully understand all aspects of hygiene knowledge, and a household registration police officer should fully understand the meaning of household registration and Baojia system. At the same time, I hope that the Youth Army, who are ambitious and capable in nation-building, will all take on this great and noble task! Sincerely, Xu Yuanzhang.

Common Sense

### Talking About "Daylight Saving Time"

—

Daylight Saving Time is a request to advance the standard time by one hour. The so-called standard time is based on the time of each 7.5-degree longitude zone east and west of Greenwich, England. Each 15 degrees east longitude is one hour earlier, and each 15 degrees west longitude is one hour later. That is, each 15 degrees of longitude from Greenwich is a time zone. For example, the area of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and east of Jiuquan in Gansu, located at 105 degrees east longitude, belongs to the Longshu Time Zone, which is seven hours earlier than Greenwich. Jiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi, located at 120 degrees east longitude, belong to the Central Plains Time Zone, which is eight hours earlier than Greenwich. That is, the clocks in Shanghai and Nanjing are one hour earlier than those in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Xi'an. In addition, China has the Changbai Time, which is one hour earlier than the Central Plains Time, and the Huizang Time and Kunlun Time, which are one hour and two hours later than the Central Plains Time, respectively. Because summer days are long and nights are short, advancing the time by one hour can take advantage of daylight and save on lighting. This idea was first proposed in Parliament in 1908 by Englishman William Willett, called the Daylight Saving Bill. He proposed that every Sunday in April, the clocks should be advanced by 20 minutes, for a total of 80 minutes at the end of the month. Every Sunday in September, the clocks should be set back by 20 minutes, for a total of 80 minutes at the end of the month to return to the original time. Unfortunately, it was rejected by Parliament. Willett then proposed it again in 1909, and again in 1911, but all were rejected. Willett was depressed by the failure of his idea and died of grief.

During the First World War, Germany, in order to save resources, first adopted this system in 1916. The results were remarkable. That year, it saved as much as 200 million marks. Later, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, and other countries followed suit. The Soviet Union also adopted it in 1930. As for the United Kingdom, also due to the benefits and the trend of the times, it changed its previous stubborn attitude and immediately adopted this system. But I wonder what Mr. Willett thought under the nine springs?

The way the United Kingdom implements this system is to advance the time by one hour from 2:00 AM on the third Sunday of April (April 16th), because at this time people are mostly resting, and it is very appropriate to move the clocks forward. After the summer, at the autumnal equinox, the day and night are almost equal, so at 2:00 AM on the first Sunday of October (October 8th), the time is set back by one hour to return to the original time.

However, although Daylight Saving Time is good, it is not beneficial to places near the equator. Because the length of day and night in the four seasons varies with the latitude. The higher the latitude, the longer the daytime in summer. The equator, located in the middle of the earth, has a latitude of zero. The sun during the day and the moon and stars at night are all above the horizon for 12 hours every day, and below the horizon for 12 hours. They rise and fall, and the length of day and night is equal throughout the year. There is no need to implement Daylight Saving Time. If it were to be adopted, people would have to get up in the dark of night. Not only would they not be able to take advantage of daylight, but they would also waste lighting. It would be a purely self-inflicted disturbance, which is far from the original intention of Daylight Saving Time. At the poles – places with a latitude of 90 degrees north or south – half the year is day and half the year is night. The sun, which is above the horizon for half a year during the day, and the moon and stars, which are above the horizon for half a year at night, circle at the same height. For the half-year that is day, the sun is above the horizon in a circular motion for 24 hours every day. There is no phenomenon of the sun setting as in the middle and low latitudes where we live. The height of the sun above the horizon is also different every day during the half-year that is day. The half-year of daylight and the half-year of night exchange to come to the horizon. Once they come, they occupy the throne for half a year, just like the half-day and half-night in our middle and low latitudes rotate to come to the horizon. This kind of circular motion is centered on a point in the northern sky – the north celestial pole – called the daily motion of celestial bodies. At the poles, its trajectory is on the horizon every day for half a year. In the middle and low latitudes, half a day is above the horizon and half a day is below the horizon, resulting in the phenomenon of celestial bodies rising in the east and setting in the west. The rising and setting of the sun is the result of the sun's daily motion. Therefore, it is not advisable to adopt Daylight Saving Time at the poles. At 66 degrees north latitude, at midnight of the summer solstice, the sun can be seen on the horizon. Shanghai is located at about 31.2 degrees north latitude. In summer, the average length of daytime is about 14 hours. Before 5:00 AM, the east is already dawning. At this time, getting up not only allows people to take advantage of daylight and go to bed early to save lighting, but also to immerse themselves in the fresh air of the morning and enjoy the beauty of nature. Both body and mind are happy, which greatly increases work efficiency and promotes good health.

The United Kingdom is located between 50 and 60 degrees north latitude, and it is very appropriate to implement Daylight Saving Time throughout the country. China has a vast territory, from the Tuansha Islands at 10 degrees north latitude to Mohe County in Heilongjiang Province at 53.5 degrees north latitude. Therefore, it is most appropriate to implement Daylight Saving Time in the central and northern regions. However, along the south coast and the areas south of it, which are quite close to the equator and have very low latitudes, implementing Daylight Saving Time does not conform to the original intention of fully utilizing daylight and saving lighting. This is from an astronomical perspective. However, it is inconvenient to use two different time systems in one country administratively, so it is better to adopt it nationwide. From May 1st to September 30th of last year, the time was advanced by one hour, and Daylight Saving Time was implemented nationwide. The results were excellent. Now summer is coming again. I hope that this system will not be forgotten. Even if the authorities issue a notice to implement it nationwide, individual agencies and schools can also enjoy its benefits by adopting it individually. Before the nationwide implementation of Daylight Saving Time last year, Central University had already implemented it, as an example of individual adoption. The purpose of this article is to introduce some excellent systems, and I hope that the people of the country will not miss the opportunity and adopt them immediately.

Inventions

### Constantly Changing

— Steel Man

The United States, with its highly developed material civilization, constantly sees the emergence of new and ingenious inventions to enhance the happiness of the people. After the end of the war, scientists and inventors are even more dedicated to researching how to benefit the people. There are indeed improvements from time to time, and inventions daily.

Spiral Museum - A spiral building completed in New York last year was designed by the famous new-style architect Frank Wright, for the collection of world-famous paintings by Sharon Guggenheim. Although the building is twelve stories high, there is not a single horizontal floor slab, only spiral extending galleries, the diameter gradually increasing from the ground floor to the top floor, the roof is built into a spherical shape, completely made of glass, the walls and exterior are decorated with paint, complete air conditioning allows various famous paintings not to use glass or other simple covers; special roof walls are impermeable to heat and sound. When tourists enter, they clear dust from their clothes and hats in a room with dust removal equipment, and then visit the spiral gallery. The annex on the right is equipped with an elevator, so that visitors do not have to reach any floor through the gallery? In the ground floor house is the manager's office.

Projector serves patients reading books - Special miniature films previously used exclusively for delivering home letters to overseas soldiers have now been used in hospitals for patients to read books; useful magazines, interesting novels, jokes, are all filmed and placed in automatic projectors, a patient lying in bed or in an "iron lung" who cannot move, can use his hands or head to turn on three switches; when the first one is turned on, the projector emits light, shining on the ceiling screen; the second switch makes a page of the book appear on the screen, and when the stone is finished, he moves it again, and the second page is projected; the third switch makes the photo retreat, so that the patient can reread any page.

Automatic clothes dryer - Weston recently specially made an automatic clothes dryer, which can replace the method of drying clothes manually with an iron, the clothes only need to be put into the box, close the box door, turn on the switch, and the electric mechanical in the box will dry the moisture of the clothes, and it can automatically stop when the work is finished.

Heating tube - Usually in household fireplaces, part of the heat scene is taken away by the exhaust smoke, if a tortuous tube is placed in the fireplace, so that the smoke must pass through the tube wall before being discharged; the lower end of the tube is fanned into cold air with a fan, and the heat comes out from the upper end of the tube, and the upper end can be connected to the tube again, so that it can be connected to any place where heat is needed.

Automatic vending counter - New York's "Marga" company applies automatic vending machines for widespread sale, originally a special "refined food" for the US military, a package of food flashes when it is removed from the rack, and a number is added.

Light yacht - Grumman, a factory specializing in the manufacture of naval aircraft during the war, recently made a aluminum yacht, about ten feet long and weighing thirty-eight pounds, so convenient that anyone can lift it, this is as convenient as using war-damaged aircraft to make fast cars.

Life

### Talking About Hope

— Shen Yungang

I once heard someone say: "A person's life is like a car that never stops, it is only allowed to move forward, not backward."

If this statement is true, then I have a good analogy for the abstract noun "hope": what should I compare it to? Compare it to the power that drives the car forward.

The so-called power that drives the car forward means: if it is a carriage, it is the donkey and horse; if it is a tram, it is electricity; if it is a train or car, it is steam.

The car cannot move forward without power. In other words, life is the same. Lacking hope means lacking the courage to "live on"!

I remember there was a story in the past about a stonemason in a village who worked hard all year round. He kept chiseling stones, "dang, dang, dang". Except for sleeping and eating, all the time was spent on work.

One day, an innocent child approached him and asked curiously, "Why do you work so hard all the time?"

He said annoyedly, "Huh! Hard work can make money."

The child asked again, "What's the use of making money?"

"Making money can maintain life."

"What happens after maintaining life?"

"Kid!" the stonemason said resentfully, "After maintaining life, I can still chisel stones."

"What happens after chiseling stones?" the annoying child asked again.

"??!!" The stonemason couldn't help but be stunned.

Yes, the stonemason realized his own pity at this moment: work, eat, work, eat... until death.

The next day, there was no sound of stonemasonry in this village.

This is a very simple story. It tells us the importance of hope to life. People who have lost hope cannot generate the power to work, just like a car that has to break down due to lack of power.

A Spanish poet said: "Hope is like a prostitute, who likes to wink and seduce people, to seduce and bewitch life."

That's right, hope is a restless woman, she likes to be flattering, to seduce people, to lead people on the right path, and also to bewitch people to embark on the wrong path.

Many people shed blood for it, many people leave a good name for it, and many people leave a bad name for it. The point to pay attention to here is that all hopes must take the happiness of the masses of mankind as the standard. The distinction between leaving a good name for eternity and leaving a bad name for ten thousand years lies here.

Be careful, friends: has the bewitching and evil hope around you merged with you and reconciled you?

"Hope", this guy, also made many people crazy, many people cried for it, many people were too sad to live, and occasionally many people held on to a hope that could never be fulfilled, and wrongly killed themselves, like Li Bai, who got drunk, wanted to fish for the moon in the water, and blindly lost his life.

The so-called hope that cannot be fulfilled is excessive "extravagant hope". How boring and wasteful it is for hope to become "extravagant", and over time, it finally becomes disappointment.

As the saying goes: "There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." You must know that "death of the heart" means losing hope.

Municipal Affairs

### Good News from Pudong

— Hansheng

According to recent reports, there are plans to implement a bridge over the Huangpu River. This is nothing less than good news for the people of Pudong and good news for the people of Shanghai! Because Shanghai's geographical situation is special during the eight years of the war of resistance, forming a distorted prosperity. Even housing has become a panic, which is really "too few monks and too little porridge." Although it is said that foreign countries will transport mobile houses, one day this excessive population will make it impossible to place mobile houses in a serious stage.

Shanghai is the place where national industry and commerce gather, and the country's economic center is also here. Therefore, it is a serious social problem for the people of Shanghai to have no houses to live in, which affects the development of industrial and commercial economy, and the country will also suffer. Therefore, the authorities

Bridge, so that the suburbs and Shanghai urban area can be integrated, to realize the "Greater Shanghai"

A plan will eventually have a day to start construction, and if construction starts, there will definitely be a day to succeed. If it is realized: we can pass this interesting bridge, overlooking the waves of the Huangpu River, watching the ships shuttle under the high belly of the bridge, we may have to shout!

Once the bridge is built, Pudong's fertile fields will become the base for factories, and the black smoke from the chimneys will dance in the air in Pudong, as if congratulating the laying of a strong cornerstone on the road to national construction. Pudong has a lot of open space, and some of the citizens of Shanghai can also be spared to come here. With the bridge, are you still afraid of inconvenience? "Long live Pudong!" I will say this to the region.

### Human Honor Ninety-Eight

The reason why humans are praised as the spirit of all things is,

Because· they can know· how they have lived,

how they are living,

how they will live, but· some people, cannot know· how they have lived, how they are living, how they will live...

living. A non-human life.

May I ask: The honor of humans being the "spirit of all things"

Will it be cancelled?

### Social Services

### Traitors Sing the "Song of Hope"

— Yang Zhimin

It is said that a group of cultural traitors in the Tilanqiao Prison today deeply regret their past deeds and are filled with sorrow. Sometimes, they reveal their emotions and sing the "Song of Hope" composed by Montov. It is said that the melody is very mournful. (The lyrics of the song are transcribed below.)

Open – the doors of the prison!
Return my sunlight!
Return my black-eyed maiden!
Return my chestnut horse.

Maiden of youth!
I want to kiss you freely!
I want to ride my horse like the wind, galloping into the wilderness!

But – the prison is tall, the heavy prison doors are locked.
The black-eyed maiden is far away, in her own home.
The warm horse, walking in the green fields, without reins, is leisurely, swaying its tail in the wind.

Only – I alone have no joy, surrounded by thick, high walls.
The shadow of the wall lamp, the dying spark, flickers sadly and weakly.
All that can be heard is, outside the prison doors, stepping on the solitude of the night, the unanswered night camp, the steady, solemn sound of footsteps.
