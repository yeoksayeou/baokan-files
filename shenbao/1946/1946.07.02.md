### Various Pending Issues in the Military Reorganization Problem: Commander Ma Suggests Direct Talks, Political Consultative Conference Indefinitely Postponed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Commander Ma once suggested to Zhou Enlai that he hoped Zhou could directly negotiate with Chairman Chiang regarding the various pending issues in the military reorganization problem. Commander Ma is willing to mediate. The other side may agree, but the meeting time has not yet been determined. According to foreign observers, if the two sides can directly negotiate, it may increase the convenience of resolving the problem.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Marshall spent the entire day resting today, only receiving the CCP representative of the Northeast Executive Headquarters, Jie Shi, at 5:30 PM to discuss the Northeast ceasefire issue.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] It is reported that if an agreement can be reached on the issue of the communist army's stationed areas during out-of-conference discussions, the Military Three-Man Committee can be convened. It is also heard that the Political Consultative Conference can only be reopened to decide on the date of convening the National Assembly, formulate the constitution, and reorganize the government to implement constitutional government after all three issues of ceasefire resumption and military reorganization have been fully agreed upon and signed.

[San Pao, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] This afternoon, the third party held a talk session at the former Central Bank, attended by Li Huang, Zhang Shenfu, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, and Mo Dehui. Shao Lizi was also invited to attend the meeting. After the meeting, according to Mo Dehui, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Subcommittee is not far off. As for the current dispute over the garrison areas for reorganization, it is only about Rehe and Luobei. In addition, Chen Qihuo, the representative of the Youth Party, returned to Nanjing this morning at 9:00 AM, and Huang Yanpei, the representative of the Democratic League, returned to Shanghai at 3:30 PM this afternoon.

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] According to Chinese sources, in order to resolve part of the crisis of disputes, Special Envoy Marshall suggested appointing three high-ranking representatives from the KMT and CCP to form a special committee to discuss the issue of local governments, and Marshall himself need not participate. However, various observers insist that Marshall's mission is not only to make the negotiators establish detailed rules, but should also take further action, such as restoring mutual trust and canceling retaliatory acts. Unless Marshall can restore mutual trust between the parties, any agreement will be equivalent to a mere scrap of paper.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Since Minister of Propaganda Xu Chu's office and the municipal government issued a public announcement yesterday afternoon, adhering to a political solution to complete peaceful unification, the tense mood on both sides has suddenly calmed down. Today, political activities related to peace and commerce in Nanjing have been carried out because the three parties involved have been distracted and exhausted for months, day and night, in this arduous and unrewarding peace negotiation. Although the results are not without achievements, they have exhausted Special Envoy Marshall and the representatives of both sides, mentally and physically, and they have to take a short break to maintain their health. It is reported that this morning, Marshall quietly stayed at his residence. The military and horses on Ninghai Road were very scarce. The representatives of the government and the CCP did not engage in any activities either. General Xu Yongchang, due to frequent reports of battles in the Hubei-Henan area, took the opportunity to examine the Central Plains map in his office for a long time. From the current situation, the out-of-conference discussions of the Military Three-Man Committee, the focus of discussion may be to stop the conflict in the Central Plains, because Li Xiannian's communist troops in the Central Plains are becoming restless and have gathered a large army to move north. According to news this evening, the flames of war have already reached Xinyang near the Pinghan Railway, and the situation there is extremely serious.

### Chief of General Staff Chen Publishes Letter to Officers and Soldiers of the Country, Elaborating on the Significance of the Establishment of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ways to Strive in the Future

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, a general, was sworn into office on the 1st and issued a letter to officers and soldiers nationwide.

The full text is as follows: Comrades, officers and soldiers of the whole country, the Ministry of National Defense of our government was officially established on June 23. Today is the day when the responsible officers at all levels of the Ministry are ordered to take office. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly present a few points on the significance of the establishment of the Ministry, the work that has been managed in the past, the urgent tasks to be completed at present, and the ways to strive in the future for the common recognition and compliance of all our officers and soldiers.

First, why do we want to establish the Ministry of National Defense, and what is the significance of establishing the Ministry of National Defense? I have already reported on this point when I attended the memorial week. It has been published in various newspapers. I think all comrades have seen it. All of you must know that a modern country must have a modern national defense to be able to stand independently in the world. Our country, due to the lessons and experiences learned from the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, should meet the needs of the national environment and conform to the trend of the world. Under the great courage and vision of the Chairman, and with reference to the US military system, the Ministry of National Defense was finally established, completing a major reform of China's epoch-making military affairs. This significance is very important, not only opening up a new reality in history but also symbolizing the bright future of China's national defense.

Regarding the reorganization of the military institutions, the Chairman gave three instructions before the establishment of the Ministry: (1) It is hoped that all levels of generals can take the national interest as the premise. Based on the needs of the present and the future, it is necessary to adjust the military institutions; (2) The reorganization of the military institutions is entirely based on the US military system and organization; (3) The reorganization should be completed before the end of May of this year. The original military institutions of the Central Committee were reorganized in accordance with these instructions. After the reorganization, the original businesses of each institution will be handed over to the Ministry of National Defense for continued handling. As for the internal establishments at all levels, most of them have been determined. The responsible personnel at all levels have been successively announced. From the reorganization of the old institutions to the establishment of the new institutions, all businesses cannot be suspended for a day. However, there are still a few points that should be specially explained here:

(1) There are four points in the legal spirit of the Ministry of National Defense: (1) Taking political military as the basis and taking the Roman experiences of past wars, political military is the most appropriate for the use of national policies and the implementation of national defense. This concept is especially common in Britain and the United States. The reorganization of military institutions, the abolition of the Military Commission that is separated from the administrative branch, and the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense to be changed into the Executive Yuan are all in line with this intention. (2) To return the military to the country, the return of the military to the country is a consistent policy of our party. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense this time is to implement this policy. Our country will soon implement democratic constitutionalism and will not allow the military institutions to break away from the administrative system and become independent. (3) For the unified command of the army, navy, and air force, in modern warfare, the strategy and tactics of the military itself have constituted the unity of the army, navy, and air force. Moreover, due to the result of military modernization, the suddenness of war is extremely great. In order to cope with emergency measures, the army, navy, and air force must be unified in command. The reorganization of institutions is to adopt this system. (4) For the application of both peace and war, the organization of the Ministry of National Defense is based on the fact that the head of state concurrently serves as the Grand Marshal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in wartime, so this kind of organization can be applied whether in wartime or peacetime, so that it will not be at a loss due to sudden wars. This reform has four spirits, and it is to establish a century-old system and lay the foundation for the country's long-term peace and stability.

(2) There are two characteristics in the organization and operation of the Ministry of National Defense: (1) It is controlled by the government, and the "ability" of military expertise belongs to the military; (2) The concrete manifestation of the Tri-Services System. The Ministry of National Defense, on behalf of the government, has the power to supervise the planning of the General Staff Headquarters. The General Headquarters are responsible for the actual implementation. This fully demonstrates the spirit of the administrative Tri-Services System.

(3) The reorganization of the original military institutions is a transitional method for the Ministry of National Defense and is divided into three steps: (1) In the first step, the businesses of the original institutions that have not been completed will continue to be handled by the original institutions; (2) In the second step, according to the businesses of the new institutions, the staff of the original institutions, in addition to being incorporated into the new institutions as much as possible, will be properly arranged for the remaining staff. The detailed methods are the same as the personnel placement methods of the troops and will not be repeated here.

Opinions of Various Committee Members

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The first meeting of the Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was chaired by Chairman Wang Yunwu. Wang explained each of the 20 articles of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' administrative outline for the 36th year, stating that although the national economic construction policy is decided by the Supreme Economic Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has the initial drafting power. Therefore, this outline was drafted for the committee members to make corrections. Subsequently, committee members such as Pan Mingxin, Gao Shukang, Wang Xiaolai, Hu Juewen, Yang Yinpu, Wu Qiyuan, and Wu YunChu successively expressed their opinions. The key points included: (1) National economic construction should be promoted in several regions, but the division of these regions need not be the same as the current provincial divisions; (2) Industrial association laws should be quickly drafted; (3) The active aspects of the economic administration outline should be adapted to the current domestic and international situation, and the passive aspects should include more "urgent" wording to address the current crisis in the industrial and commercial sectors. In addition, some committee members pointed out: (1) Reasonable regulations should be in place regarding land prices for newly established factories; (2) Industrial taxes should be lower than commercial taxes and tax exemptions should be considered; (3) Factory registration should be handled by the provincial government to avoid cumbersome layering; (4) In addition to strengthening the interest protection system, "profit protection" and "value preservation" should be further implemented. Today's focus was on the discussion of general principles, and specific issues will be studied tomorrow. Regarding industrial association laws, many people expressed at today's meeting that industrial associations must be separated from the current chamber of commerce laws. It was decided to appoint Yu Geyu, Xue Mingjian, and Ouyang Lun as a research group to submit the results to the general meeting for decision, and then send them to the legislative body for reference.

### Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Group Inspects Road and Port Projects; Group Leader Hou Jiayuan Talks to Reporters: Both Railways Should Be Equipped with Electrical Signals

[Our Dispatch] According to Hou Jiayuan, head of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, the staff recently dispatched to the south to inspect ports have returned to Shanghai. The team visited Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other places. A detailed report is currently being prepared regarding the situation of railways and important ports within the customs borders. The group has now dispatched two more teams: one to inspect the Yellow River Railway Bridge and the other to Qingdao, as there is a large amount of engineering machinery in Qingdao since its recovery, requiring experts to inspect it in detail. These two inspection teams are expected to return to Shanghai in about ten days. At that time, the inspection work within the customs borders will be fully completed.

Hou also stated that there are three major engineering projects that urgently need to be carried out: (1) Tanggu Bay; (2) The Yellow River Railway Bridge; (3) The Nanjing-Shanghai, Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The Tanggu Port project requires the most investment and time, while the railway projects are relatively simpler. He strongly advocates that both railways should be equipped with electrical signals because the total cost of electrical signals is only about US$3-4 million, which is only one-third of the cost of laying double tracks, while the transport capacity is equivalent to double tracks. This type of electrical signal can automatically warn oncoming vehicles during train travel, avoiding the danger of train collisions and saving excessive stopover time. The two railways can rely on this device to shorten travel time, increase the number of running vehicles, and thereby increase transport capacity. These electrical signals are commonly used in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and other places.

The (missing character) situation has been observed, and a detailed report has been submitted to the Executive Yuan. Once approved, the work will begin immediately. To meet the needs of the work, the group has appointed American engineers in Shanghai, including Zhusi (locomotive and vehicle engineer), Feifan (electrical signal engineer), Tietusi (port engineer), and Xu Na (railway engineer), to go to the United States to purchase building materials. They are scheduled to fly to the United States on July 3rd.

### The Major Traitor Wen Zongyao Was Tried in Nanjing Yesterday; The Trial Has Concluded, and the Verdict Will Be Announced on the 8th

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Capital High Court publicly tried the major traitor Wen Zongyao this afternoon (the 1st). His family members were also present in the gallery. According to Wen's confession, he is currently eighty-two years old. On March 30th of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), he and Chen (omitted), the traitor Liang Hongzhi, organized the puppet Reformed Government, and held positions such as the President of the Legislative Yuan and the President of the Judicial Yuan in the puppet organization. He was arrested in Shanghai on September 28th of last year.

After the trial, the presiding judge announced that the verdict in this case would be announced at 2:00 PM on July 8th.

### The Retrial of the Chu Traitor Case

His Wife Submitted a Petition to the Jiangsu High Court Yesterday, Requesting the Rejection of the Prosecutor's Appeal

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] The case of the Chu Minyi, the traitor to China, was ordered to be retried by the Suzhou High Court. The following day, the handling prosecutor, Li Shudong, filed an appeal, requesting the revocation of the retrial order. This document has now been submitted to the Supreme Court for a final decision. Chu (omitted) and Chen Shunzhen resubmitted a petition to the Suzhou High Court around 9:00 AM on the 1st, requesting that the Supreme Court reject the prosecutor's appeal. The reasons stated in the petition were roughly: Dr. Sun Yat-sen was deeply saddened by Chen Jiongming's rebellion, which destroyed all the drafts he had created over several years. This shows that Dr. Sun Yat-sen valued his original manuscripts very highly. The defendant's preservation of his original manuscripts should certainly be commended. Dr. Sun Yat-sen himself said that those who (omitted) him (omitted) would create unlimited benefits for the country and the nation. Therefore, preserving the legacy of the deceased is also beneficial to the nation and the country. The arguments in the appeal should be regarded as insignificant and do not show respect for Dr. Sun Yat-sen. His claim that it is not beneficial to the people is contrary to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's testament, and the appeal should be rejected.

### The Perpetrators of the Nanjing Massacre Should Be Executed on the Spot

### The Soviet Union Transported Japanese Prisoners from Northeast China; The U.S. Estimates Up to 700,000; All Are Laboring in Siberia

Although the U.S. Has Repeatedly Questioned the Soviet Union, There Has Been No Formal Response

[United Press, Washington, 30th] U.S. officials estimated today that the Soviet Union has transported approximately 700,000 Japanese troops from the nine northeastern provinces of China to Siberia for labor. This estimate is based on military reports from all units of the Japanese army in the nine northeastern provinces after the end of the war. Although the United States has repeatedly questioned the Soviet Union, Moscow has not provided a formal response. Authorities here consider this situation to be one of the international frictions. Another, albeit less important, indication of friction between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the United States to open a consulate in the Soviet-occupied area of northern Korea. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has had a consulate in Seoul, the American-occupied area of southern Korea. The United States, after months of negotiations, had requested the same privilege in Pyongyang, the city where the headquarters of the Soviet army in the north is located. The Soviet Union then closed its consulate in Seoul several months ago to end the dispute.

### Criminals' Families in Suzhou Prison Urge for Prompt Promulgation of Amnesty Order; Petition Cites Ancient and Modern Examples, Even Traitors Hope to Be Pardoned

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] Several hundred criminal and traitor convicts detained in Suzhou's Third Prison, in the name of all the prisoners' families, submitted petitions to the central authorities, including the National Government and the Executive Yuan, urging the prompt promulgation of an amnesty order to demonstrate the government's virtue of starting anew with the people. The original petition cited ancient and modern examples, stating that after the An Lushan Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty, lenient punishments were given, and officials involved in the Yuanyou factional strife in the Northern Song Dynasty were reinstated not long after. Citing recent examples, the British government, after its victory, formally announced that in the Southeast Asian region, those who cooperated with or were attached to the enemy would not be prosecuted if they did not help the enemy commit atrocities, and those who had been convicted would be released. Siam exempted criminals from prosecution by not applying laws retroactively. Norway only punished the arch-villain Quisling and pardoned the rest. The puppet Prime Minister of the Philippines, Roxas, was recently elected president. At a time when our country's industries are declining and the people are suffering, upholding virtue and commuting sentences are truly urgent matters. They request the government to follow the rule of the Zhou and Han dynasties and emulate the Tang and Song dynasties by issuing a special edict of amnesty.

### Surprisingly, a Traitor's Gate Produced a Filial Daughter; Jiang Kanghu, a Traitor of the Yangtze River, Fell Ill in Prison; His Daughter Insisted on Entering the Prison to Serve Him

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Jiang Kanghu, a traitor in North China, has been ill in prison for over ten days. His daughter, Jiang Zhaoju, has repeatedly requested the High Court to release him on bail for medical treatment, but all requests have been rejected. Jiang Zhaoju has recently insisted again on entering the prison to care for her father's illness. Initially, her request was not approved, but Jiang Zhaoju personally went to the High Court a few days ago, refusing to eat or sleep, and weeping in the courtyard all day long, refusing to leave. She pleaded to be allowed to enter the prison to care for her father's illness. President Zhao and Jin Shiding, the presiding judge of Jiang's case, were both moved. Since yesterday, she has been allowed to enter the prison twice a day to serve medicine and food, to fulfill her filial piety.

### Disaster Caused by Wind and Rain in Wenling; Heavy Damage on Land and Water

[Our Wenling Communication] Since the evening of the 23rd, there has been heavy rain with strong winds and rough waves. Coastal dikes have collapsed in many places. The prison behind the county government was also destroyed by the wind. Due to mountain torrents, the water depth in the countryside is three to four feet, especially in the Shuiyang area in the north of the county, which is a vast expanse of water, and all the early rice crops have been submerged. The sweet potatoes, taro, beans, melons, and tobacco planted in the mountains were all blown down by the wind, causing serious damage. The offshore ship running between Jiangxia and Wenzhou stopped sailing due to the strong wind and tidal surge. The steamship on the Hetou Outer Luqiao also suspended service due to the rising river. All ships in various ports were suspended. All townships and towns announced the suspension of markets due to the flooding. The telegraph and telephone poles from the county seat to Yuhuan and Huangyan were all broken, and traffic was interrupted. On the 25th, the section from Kanmen to Wenling was repaired and restored. The section from Zeguo to the county seat is still blocked because the water depth in the countryside is several feet and has not yet receded, and technicians cannot rush to repair it. As of the 26th, it was still blocked. It is also reported that several fishing boats and merchant ships on the Shiling Sea were blown and sunk. A certain Chen in the Xian River of the county, who was transporting more than a thousand fir trees from Wenzhou, was also attacked and sunk by a strong wind and sea wave in the outer sea of Jiangxia. His life and death are unknown.

### Editorial: Economic Policy Cannot Stop at Planning

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently selected and appointed a group of economic planning committee members, with many figures from the industrial and commercial sectors participating. The Economic Planning Committee is holding a meeting in the capital starting yesterday, the main purpose of which is, of course, to formulate a sound economic plan. At this critical juncture of economic panic and production contraction, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' ability to convene a meeting to solicit diverse opinions is somewhat more satisfactory than doing nothing and standing idly by. However, we believe that the economic policy of a country should not be considered the end of a government's capabilities simply by formulating a plan. In other words, economic policy is valued for its implementation and must not stop at planning.

Plans, plans, we have heard and seen so many of them over the years. How many plans have actually been implemented? How many plans have been effectively executed? How many effectively executed plans have truly benefited the country and its people? These are issues that deserve serious reflection from both the government and the public. Therefore, if we are elated by the convening of the Economic Planning Committee and believe that the current economic crisis can be resolved and the government's economic policy can be realized, it seems overly optimistic and premature. Moreover, the subsequent economic plan still needs to be carefully discussed by this committee, and whether a practical and feasible plan can be formulated remains to be seen.

Speaking of meetings related to economic matters, as far as we know, there seem to be overlapping and redundant arrangements, with everything already covered. First, at the central level, there is the Supreme Economic Council, which has already been established, with the Premier and Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan serving as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. Its members include the heads of the five Yuan (branches of government) and the ministers of Finance, Economic Affairs, Food, Agriculture and Forestry, Transportation, and Social Affairs. Its nature is the highest planning and supervisory body for the national economy, and its high position and great power need not be emphasized. Second, the Executive Yuan regularly establishes the "Emergency Meeting for Stabilizing Finance," presided over by Premier Song himself, with the main tasks being: (1) determining monetary policy, (2) balancing revenue and expenditure, (3) managing the budget, (4) economizing consumption, and (5) allocating resources. This meeting, though named a financial meeting, is actually related to economic matters in every aspect. Third, it is now the turn of the Economic Planning Committee convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. We do not know whether this committee is a permanent meeting body or whether it is just a one-time meeting. But in any case, it seems to be a serious meeting. Even so, we have already seen three levels of meeting bodies. Moreover, under the current political system, the central decision-making bodies also include the highly placed Supreme National Defense Council and the Central Standing Committee. It can be seen that there seems to be a surplus, rather than a shortage, of meeting bodies for deciding on plans. And why is it that when the country has reached such a severe economic crisis today, we still have to study economic plans? What exactly have these many meeting bodies, which should bear the responsibility for decision-making, been doing in the past?

If it is said that plans should be as detailed as possible? That plans should be discussed jointly with representatives of the people? Then, we must first have two common understandings, which are: (1) Plans must first establish basic principles. If there are no principles, or if there are principles but they are shelved, then planning will be difficult to start. (2) The National Political Council currently represents the general public, and the responsible persons of industrial and commercial legal entities in various regions represent industry and commerce. If the government truly wants to diligently seek public opinion and listen to the people's opinions on economic issues, it should recruit talents from these institutions. Now the Ministry of Economic Affairs is convening the Economic Planning Committee, and the intention is certainly commendable, but we hope that it can pay attention to these two points, otherwise it will inevitably become a mere formality. Regarding the latter, it is reported that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the preparatory committee of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce have successively telegraphed the government, requesting that a national economic conference be convened as soon as possible to achieve the task of truly communicating opinions between the government and the people and implementing economic policies. This will not be discussed in detail here. We will only talk about the prerequisites for formulating economic plans.

The basic principles of economic planning have actually been established by the government long ago. In the distant past, there was Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan, there were the hints in President Chiang's "China's Destiny," and there were the "Post-War First Phase Economic Construction Principles" passed by the 148th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on November 6, 1944. More recently, there were the outlines of various economic policies passed by the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang last year, and there were the economic emergency measures passed by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee in March this year. We must first ask: In the ten months since the victory, have all the actual economic measures taken by the government paid attention to the principles that the government had already established? Or have they simply forgotten the principles due to the complexity of events? Today's economic crisis is so deep. Is it because there is no plan? Or is it because many facilities often violate the original plan? If this point is not clarified, not to mention that this meeting of the Economic Planning Committee may not produce any results, even if a national economic conference is convened on a larger scale, it will inevitably lead to resolutions without implementation, which is equivalent to not discussing anything. The government's future economic measures will still be plans as plans, facts as facts, with neither paying attention to the other, and each going its own way. Even if there are great economic policies, they will only be seen to end up circling in the middle of "planning here, planning there"!

Let us give one example to prove that what has been said is not an exaggeration. For example, regarding the division of state-owned and private enterprises, looking at Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, President Chiang's instructions, and the provisions of the First Phase Economic Construction Principles, ordinary industry and commerce were not only allowed to be monopolized and included by state capital, but also allowed private operation. However, recently, in addition to the fact that most of the light industries such as textiles and silk have been state-owned, even the sugar transported from Taiwan has been changed to be sold exclusively by the government. What principle is this planned according to? And the strangest thing is that before the companies established by the government exclusively sold it, the market price of Taiwanese sugar was always within 50,000 yuan per bag when distributed by the industry, but once it was classified as state-owned, it soon rose to more than 110,000 yuan. Why do this? In any case, the government's economic plan at this time should not be directed towards leading price increases through monopolistic methods. However, what is currently being manifested by the facts is already like this. What better plan will be formulated in the future? Even if there is a good plan, how do we know how it will be implemented in practice? Economic problems have only allowed us to hear meetings and see plans until now. It is no wonder that the economic crisis is getting deeper day by day!

### Lieutenant General Blandy, Commander, Announces Successful Atomic Bomb Test: Target Ships Sunk Four, Damaged Twenty-Five; Bombing Deviated Slightly from Planned Target

(Our Newspaper News) San Francisco, 1st: Scientists, members of Congress, and UN observers felt a sense of disappointment at the lackluster scene of this morning's atomic bomb explosion. A Soviet professor shrugged and walked away as he watched the mushroom cloud rise, saying, "It's not that impressive."

Lieutenant General Blandy

(Our Newspaper News) San Francisco, 1st: Lieutenant General Blandy of the Navy believes the atomic bomb test was a success and announced the extent of the damage to the ships as follows: Two transport ships sunk; the US destroyer "Lamson" capsized; the US submarine "Scamp," the Japanese cruiser "Sakawa," the US aircraft carrier "Independence," and the US cruiser "Pensacola" heavily damaged; the US battleship "New York" and "Nevada," the Japanese carrier "Nagato," the US aircraft carrier "Saratoga," medium landing craft No. 1, oil tanker No. 160, the destroyer "Wilson," transport ships "Niagara," "Branden," "Penner," "Butt," "Föderguan," and several other ships were slightly damaged. Of the seventy-five ships loaded with guinea pigs, only seventeen were injured, twelve were injured. Radio facsimile devices set up three miles from the target area showed the explosion at the time was extremely alarming. When the atomic bomb exploded, the entire port bottom subsided. Then the radio facsimile screen suddenly turned completely white, possibly due to the flash of the bomb. When it cleared up, the palm trees along the coast were either uprooted or tilted, as if they had been ravaged by a typhoon.

(Our Newspaper News) San Francisco, 1st: Lieutenant General Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb test, issued a second cold drink report, stating: Three ships sank after the atomic bomb was dropped this morning, another is sinking, and a total of twenty-five were heavily damaged.

### In an Instant of Bombing, the Flash and Smoke Soared into the Sky, with a Thunderous Sound that was Frightening, but Did Not Cause an Earthquake or Tsunami

(Reuters New York, 30th) The atomic bomb was dropped and exploded at Bikini Atoll at 22:03 Greenwich Mean Time (7:03 AM Shanghai time on Monday morning), scattering a mushroom cloud that spread to 20,000 feet, completely covering the island. A bright yellow color appeared in the center, and the entire island disappeared into the smoke, fire, and water. The smoke column was 50,000 feet high, and several ships were engulfed in flames. After five minutes, the shapes of the ships could be seen. Super radio-controlled observation machines were destroyed. Minutes later, aircraft soared into the clouds to scout, and radio-controlled torpedo boats also sailed into the radio-active waters of the island for observation. Observers 140 miles away could see the explosion. According to a Columbia Broadcasting System interviewer who was closest to the atomic bomb explosion, the explosion did not feel like a tremor, nor was there a tsunami. Our reporter reported: The bomb exploded in 50 seconds, and the sound of thunder was not heard until two minutes later. The bomb deviated slightly from the target, as the "Nagato" could still be seen after the smoke cleared.

Unmanned Aircraft Landed Safely

(Associated Press Garin, 1st) Blandy broadcasted: "The drift of the cloud is as expected, but there is no danger to anyone or the nearby islands." It is reported that all radio-controlled drones that passed through the toxic mist to measure the radiation energy of the atomic bomb have landed safely. Blandy confirmed that the atomic bomb that bombed Nagasaki was more effective and destructive than the one that bombed Hiroshima. He said, "No one is allowed into the lagoon until everything is absolutely safe."

According to Honolulu: Hawaii did not record anything in this morning's atomic bomb explosion.

According to Parsons, Deputy Officer of the Atomic Bomb Test: This explosion can be equivalent to a thousand tons of bombs, and damage in the bombed area can be measured later. However, this kind of pregnancy should be kept secret. According to a reporter on the ship Appalachian: Minutes after the atomic bomb was dropped, dark smoke gushed up from the lagoon. Looking at it through black glasses, the flash was very faint, like distant lightning. Then a narrow pink, neat toxic mist was seen quickly rising. About ninety seconds later, a rumbling sound was heard, like thunder or distant naval gunfire. On the thunder screen, the target "Nevada" and the Japanese ship "Nagato" could be seen, and the aircraft carrier "Independence" was on fire.

According to an aerial broadcast: The explosion of the bomb appeared to be slightly distant from the target, deviating towards the aircraft carrier "Independence," and the upper structure seemed to be partially blown up. The Appalachian, 15 miles from the explosion, also reported that the bomb missed the target, with the battleship "Nevada" in the middle, which was planned as a target ship. After the explosion, it could still be seen outside.

### The Atomic Bomb Dropped Was Made Using Plutonium

(Associated Press Reporter Ship Parachin near Bikini, 30th) Atomic expert Dr. Compton recently announced: The atomic bomb that was dropped was made using Plutonium.

### With Intertwined Sound and Light, it Was a Spectacle: A Central News Agency Reporter's Eyewitness Account

(Special Dispatch from CNA Reporter Song Dehe, aboard the US ship Appalachian, outside Bikini, 1st) The experiment to observe swelling has seen the atomic bomb explode within the original scheduled time today. Using a special black dragon, we first saw the first flash pass, like a full eye rising from the horizon. Immediately, a huge white, neat layer was in the sky above the sea, and the orange fireball was full of diffuse distribution. A high column of white clouds immediately shot into the air, forming a huge makeup special. Then it disappeared into the natural cloud layer staying in the target area. The sound of the explosion reached eighteen miles away. It had been over a hundred and thirty-three seconds when it reached our ears. Its solemn ceremony was similar to the weak artillery fire from Dada Place that the elder of the year heard in Taierzhuang. The natural cloud layer was scattered after a few minutes. At this time, only the long-term special of the "atomic cloud layer" was seen, the edge was white, but the center was hot red. Nine minutes later, the height of the state column was only 24,000 feet, which was less than the atomic cloud layer of the previous three times, and its bottom layer had disappeared.

### Albania and Yugoslavia Take a Hostile Attitude Towards Greece; Incidents Occur Repeatedly in the Macedonian Region

(Reuters Athens, 30th) Yesterday morning, twenty armed bandits crossed into Greek territory from Albania, inciting nearby Greek villagers to take up arms, and alleging that the Greek government violated the "Fermor Chai Convention." Incidents have also occurred repeatedly in the Macedonian region. The Albanian Prime Minister has also recently taken a hostile attitude towards Greece with Yugoslavia, and it is said that the friendship treaty between Albania and Yugoslavia may include a military coordination agreement. If the Foreign Ministers' Conference assigns North Epirus to Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia may take joint action.

### Meticulous Arrangements Before Bombing: "Dave's Dream," the Star Bomber; Mobilized Over 40,000 People, Only One Injured

"French News Agency Atomic Bomb Viewing Basket 'Appalachian' 1st" Atomic bomb test commander Lieutenant General Blandy announced this afternoon: More than 40,000 staff and visitors of this atomic bomb explosion test were completely unharmed. The only one affected was the atomic bomb bomber, who failed to think about covering his eyes after bombing, causing him to be affected by the flash. This atomic bomb explosion proved to be equal to the power of the bomb used to bomb Nagasaki in August last year. At present, a large number of speculations on the results of the test can only be announced to the world after scientific investigation.

(Reuters New York, 30th) The super-fortress "Dave's Dream" that dropped the atomic bomb departed from Kwajalein Atoll at 18:50 standard time (3:50 AM Shanghai time on Monday morning). At that time, the morning light on the Pacific Ocean was dim, and although the climate was not perfect, the test was not hindered at all. In order to prevent accidents, thousands of people who were not needed on the island were evacuated in advance. Our reporter, Lechte, reported from the American ship Appalachian: Ships were arranged in a circle around the horseshoe-shaped coral reef outside Bikini Atoll, and all 161 residents on the island had been evacuated long ago. Several core physicists loaded the atomic bomb into the bomb bay of "Dave's Dream." When the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet, two experts took over the assembly of the atomic bomb, and then the bomber prepared to drop it.

Complete Test Photography Record

The super-fortress frame subsequently recorded all film records. Several other cameras, some of which were radio-controlled, were also prepared to capture all test records. Half an hour after the explosion, a naval aircraft returned to inspect the area 2,000 feet in the air above the explosion site. If the radio wave activity is not very intense, two more aircraft will be sent to ascend to a few feet from the island surface to collect some soil for inspection. At the same time, six gunboats carrying radio experts and radio measuring instruments will sail close to the coral island to test the activity of radio waves. The flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant General Blandy, is moored 12 miles from the island, and all reports are sent to the ship, and Blandy will then decide when to allow ships to enter the target area. He will say that several hours after the explosion, the second stage of radio experts will enter to study the radio wave activity of the target ships. When they send a signal to deregulate, six landing craft will carry the first batch of people to the coral reef to quickly investigate the damage. The reserve personnel and reporters will land later.

Detailed Results to Be Announced

Lieutenant General Blandy said: The results that can be announced will be announced to the public in a few days, at most a few weeks. Scientific research on these results will take longer. The last person on Bikini Atoll was evacuated at midnight. One hundred and fifty ships and 40,000 personnel participating in the unknown were evacuated from noon yesterday. The ship carrying the reporters was moored about 20 miles northwest of the target. After receiving a weather report a few hours later, Lieutenant General Blandy announced that the test was underway. At midnight, the instruments on the target ship began to make sounds. At this time, only the cries of various animals on the ship and the sound of waves on the sea surface were heard. The subsequent sound waves were the sound of the atomic bomb exploding. After the bomb disappeared, 40,000 scientists, practitioners, and observers will remove their protective glasses and wait for the signal to deregulate so that they can enter the target area to inspect the old ships, such as Bikini Island and Nevada, and the instruments suspended on the necks of 200 pigs, 300 sheep, 3,000 white mice, and various animals for verification.

Good Weather on the Coral Reef

(Associated Press Kwajalein Atoll, 1st) "Dave's Dream" pilot Swenke德 gained the qualification to drive because of his technical preparation for test flights with fake atomic bombs. As the bomber took off, 30 other aircraft participating in the test were already waiting in the air. Shortly before "Dave's Dream" ascended, Major Wood, the bomber, told the broadcasters: I hope to hit the target ship "Nevada" with one blow. When asked what would happen if the target was missed? Wood replied: "I will change course." Atomic bomb test commander Lieutenant General Blandy said on the flagship "McKinley" late yesterday: The air climate on the coral reef this morning is better than expected. I guarantee that the first atomic bomb will be dropped according to the scheduled time. According to the news from San Francisco early this morning: Blandy ordered the bombing time to be delayed by about 50 minutes compared to the planned time.

### No Explosion Records Were Measured Anywhere

(Associated Press Sydney, Australia, 1st) The question measurement station announced today: The seismograph of this station did not measure the atomic bomb explosion record of Bikini Coral.

"Central News Agency Tokyo 1st Associated Press" The Japanese Central Meteorological Observatory recently stated: At present, Japan has not observed any significant impact caused by the Bikini atomic bomb explosion.

### Parisians Worry About the Sky Falling

(French News Agency Paris, 1st) Richard Nas of the US delegation to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and many other US representatives focused on a room in the Musey's Belly Museum (the US delegation's style) today. The group received radio reports about the atomic bomb test on Bikini Coral Reef in the Pacific Ocean, but the broadcast sound often disappeared, or was blocked, making it difficult to listen. Most Parisians who are overly sensitive are deeply afraid that the effect of atomic bomb bombing may affect the other side of the earth, so they have gone to earthquake observatories in various parts of Paris to ask whether they have measured explosion records and whether Parisians can sleep soundly. In fact, they could not get a satisfactory answer, because the radiation force of the atom must reach Paris after 15 hours, and records can be made on measuring instruments. At that time, if any records are measured, they will be published.

### Hiroshima Residents Turn Pale at the Mention of Atomic Bombs

(Associated Press Hiroshima, 1st) Hiroshima is the capital city bombed by atomic bombs. Its residents are like islands of crossbows and arrows, turning pale when they hear of atomic bombs. Now they are also concerned about the results of the Bikini test. Mayor Kihara said that Hiroshima's being bombed by atomic bombs is actually the first step towards peace. The residents of Hiroshima have learned from their pain and are willing that atomic energy will never be seen in war again, but can be used to promote civilization.

(Associated Press Kwajalein, 1st) Brigadier General Lemay used to ride a B-29 aircraft and drop atomic economists on Japan. It is said that today's atomic bomb test "performance is wonderful," but the bomb is not as powerful as the one dropped on Nagasaki.

### Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting Turns Positive; French Compromise Proposal Under Discussion; Italy Reserves Details of Ship List to be Published

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The Foreign Ministers' Meeting is rapidly turning positive. It is expected that an agreement on convening a 21-nation conference will be reached at today's meeting. At Saturday's five-hour meeting of the four foreign ministers, the compromise solution for the Port of Trieste proposed by France was agreed by the other three foreign ministers as a basis for discussion. Revisions were accommodated yesterday, and the formal agenda for today's Foreign Ministers' Meeting is: (1) the Trieste issue, (2) the issue of Italian colonies, (3) the date for convening the 21-nation conference, and (4) the German issue. The four foreign ministers may not be able to complete the entire agenda, but if the Trieste issue can be resolved, at least the draft Five-Power Treaty can reach the stage where it can be submitted to the 21-nation conference. A decision was also reached on the Danube River clause during Saturday's discussions, and it is expected that the draft treaties with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria will no longer be problematic. The Finnish treaty has long been completed, with only some clauses requiring textual revisions. The Italian reparations issue remains unresolved, but once the Trieste issue is resolved, the reparations issue will also face little obstruction.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Before the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting, negotiations were completed regarding the division of Italian warships. France decided to allow Italy to retain a portion of its warships. Details of the retained portion have now been published, stipulating that Italy may retain:

Two heavy cruisers, four destroyers, sixteen torpedo boats, and nineteen minesweepers.

### Ethnic Clash in Southern Italy; Trieste in Chaos

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 1st (Broadcast): While the foreign ministers are discussing the Trieste issue without reaching an agreement, the port is now in a state of chaos. Last night, dozens of people armed with clubs killed an Italian worker, and 200,000 workers went on strike today to protest. Also last night, several grenade explosions occurred, killing one person and injuring thirty, including nine American soldiers.

### Kidnapping of Indonesian Government Officials; Perpetrated by the Fifth Column; Prime Minister Sjahrir Has Escaped

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 1st (Broadcast): The Prime Minister of the Republic of Indonesia, Sjahrir, who was kidnapped, has escaped and been escorted to the government headquarters by the army. Other kidnapped officials, such as Economic Minister Darmawan, are also safe.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 30th] The President of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno, recently delivered a broadcast speech, urging the extremists who kidnapped Prime Minister Sjahrir and other active officials to release them as soon as possible, to avoid causing a bad impression abroad. He also said that this matter could be used by the Netherlands as an excuse to occupy all of Indonesia. "I do not want to become a dictator, nor do I want to concentrate all power in myself, even temporarily. I plan to go to Solo to rescue the Prime Minister with all my strength, even resorting to force if necessary. If this effort fails, there is no doubt that the extremists will be able to control the interior." It is reported that the kidnapping was carried out by the Fifth Column, whose leader, Marajah, was imprisoned several months ago for conspiring to revolt against the government. The party kidnapped government officials in retaliation. In addition, the kidnappers were very dissatisfied with the East Indonesian government's consultations with the Allied authorities, and resorted to kidnapping government officials as a means of expressing their dissatisfaction.

### Soviet Union Actively Researching; Cosmic Rays' Destructive Power Exceeds Atomic Bomb

[Reported by this newspaper] According to military sources: The Soviet Union has a Cosmic Ray Research Institute located somewhere within its borders, with many of the country's top scientists actively engaged in research. It is said that this cosmic ray utilizes solar reflection and its destructive power is far greater than that of the atomic bomb. Those with foresight are worried about the future of humanity.

### Poland Holds; National Referendum

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 1st] Poland held its first national referendum since liberation yesterday, asking the people to answer three questions: (1) Should the Senate be abolished? (2) Should the current government's reforms, characterized by land reform, state-owned industry, and protection of private enterprise, be stabilized, and should these reforms be stipulated in the new constitution? (3) Should Poland's western border be defined by the Baltic Sea, the Oder River, and the Neisse River? More than ten million people participated in the vote, and the voting process went smoothly. According to Polish law, all propaganda or distribution of leaflets is prohibited within one meter of polling stations, and each polling station is guarded by one police officer.

### Car Crashes into Boulder; Gandhi Unhurt; Vows to Live to 100 to Serve the People

[United Press, Poona, 30th] Gandhi's car crashed into a boulder on the track this morning, 68 miles from here, narrowly escaping disaster. Gandhi later said, "God does not want me to die. We did not encounter any disaster, but it was a near miss. I have never harmed anyone, and I don't know who wants to assassinate me. Now, with God's blessing, I hope to live to 125 and serve the people." The car hit several boulders, causing violent tremors, but fortunately no one was injured.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 30th] Indian saint Gandhi recently stated that he supports and participates in the passive resistance movement initiated against the discrimination against Indian expatriates in South Africa, and that all Indians have an obligation to participate in the passive resistance movement launched in support of the South African compatriots.

### International Tribunal Continues to Try Japanese War Criminals; Former Japanese Interior Minister Gotō Fumio Testifies About the Inner Workings of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association; Says It Aims to Control All Political Activities in Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] Today, the prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal presented a document from the Japanese government to the court, proving that some of the Japanese war criminals on trial were previously connected to the ultranationalist Black Dragon Society, and all the groups that participated in the society were listed in detail. Among them was a group led by former Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki and former Army Minister Aoki. According to witness Ugaki Kazushige, the greatest power in controlling the Japanese army, apart from the Emperor, should be the Chief of the General Staff. The defense attorney repeatedly questioned Ugaki, hoping to prove that Minami Jiro was indeed powerless to stop the expansion of the Northeast Incident in 1931. In addition, Gotō Fumio, who served as Interior Minister in the Okada Cabinet for three days in 1936, was also brought from Sugamo Prison to testify. In his testimony, Gotō stated that in 1940, he cooperated with Konoe to establish a society called the Taisei Yokusankai (Imperial Rule Assistance Association), and Hashimoto Kingorō was one of its members. After the establishment of the Taisei Yokusankai, no other important political parties or organizations existed in Japan. The purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai was to establish a political group in Japan that was entirely controlled by the government. The Taisei Yokusankai was subsidized by the government, and each region had a branch. When the defense attorney questioned Gotō, the court observers felt that his questions were not to the point. Chief Justice Webb questioned Gotō, and Gotō testified that the Taisei Yokusankai was to help the Japanese people fulfill their responsibilities to the country. Webb then asked, "What are the Japanese people's responsibilities to the country?" Gotō replied that it was the responsibility that the Japanese people must fulfill. When asked if the responsibilities included military matters, he replied yes. Hashimoto Kingorō's defense attorney asked if the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai was not to incite the Japanese people to initiate this illegal and inhumane war. Gotō replied that the purpose of the association was not that. Webb later declared that the association seemed to be a mechanism for government officials to control the people.

### Director Wu Talks About Food Management; Resolves Not to Fear Rice Merchants' Threats; Municipal Government Directly Allocates Grain to Rice Shops

Still Urging Rice Traders to Purchase; Licenses Will Be Revoked if They Are Unwilling to Operate

[Reported by this newspaper] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu declared yesterday: The North and South Rice Markets will be established on the 3rd of this month, so the newly established Grain Management Section of the Social Affairs Bureau has also stepped up preparations to ensure that it can officially start work before the 3rd. The section chief has been internally appointed to be concurrently held by Bureau Specialist Jiang Jiming.

Regarding the future grain management measures, Director Wu said: In the past, the Food Department often dumped rice as soon as it had it, which led to the department's rice ending up in the hands of rice merchants. Sometimes, even a single rice merchant would purchase all of it, which did not seem appropriate. In the future, the municipal government will directly allocate rice to each rice shop, reducing the exploitation of rice traders in the middle. Therefore, the difference between this management and the past is that the previous sales were unlimited, while now it is a limited allocation.

In the future, rice shops should first register with the Social Affairs Bureau, and then the bureau will determine the allocation quantity based on the business situation of each rice shop. The bureau will also investigate the rice storage quantity of each rice shop at any time to make reasonable adjustments. Although the bureau will no longer have a relationship with the rice traders, it will still urge them to purchase. They will still be able to sell their purchased rice to the market in the future, but it will not be related to the government.

In the past, rice traders opposed price controls and did try to coerce the government, and some expressed that they were unwilling to lose money and would rather not operate rice businesses. The government has decided to revoke the licenses of these rice merchants who have expressed their unwillingness to continue operating. The rice price in the producing areas has always fluctuated depending on the Shanghai market price. Since the Shanghai rice price has not risen sharply, there is no reason for the price in the producing areas to be high. The current problem lies in the fact that the rice in the producing areas has already ended up in the hands of rice merchants. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to send personnel to Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang, Jinshan, Changzhou, and other producing areas to investigate whether Shanghai rice merchants have purchased rice and what the purchase quantity is. After rice merchants buy rice, they often store it in the countryside. Because the jurisdiction is different, the municipal government has no right to intervene. However, when Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang came to Shanghai last time, the municipal government consulted with Chairman Wang, and Chairman Wang has expressed his willingness to provide assistance.

Rice and grain were indeed more difficult to obtain in February and March, but the municipal government is currently trying to find a way to solve the problem with tribute rice and foreign rice, and it is believed that there will definitely be a solution. Rice merchants are now indeed fighting against the government, and their courage is quite admirable, but the municipal government is not afraid of such threats!

The more than 7,000 shi of rice that are currently being allocated are all top-quality white rice. If there are cases where it is not possible to buy rice, it is feared that there are still corrupt merchants at play. It is hoped that such cases will be reported for investigation. In the future, rice shops that receive allocations must mark the rice price, otherwise the allocation will be stopped. Those who refuse to sell after receiving the allocation will be severely punished. The current price limit is 46,000 yuan per shi, plus a 6% profit and some transportation costs. Although some rice merchants have requested a price increase, the municipal government has decided to maintain the original price and will not change it. As for government agencies, schools, training centers, and other institutions that need more rice, the government can allocate it. Factories and larger companies can be issued procurement certificates by the Social Affairs Bureau, and they can designate the procurement area themselves. Several yarn factories have already applied to the Social Affairs Bureau.

The rice from the Food Administration has not yet been sent to the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu said, "If it is to be handed over, it must be handed over in full." According to reports, in addition to the rice reserves, the administration also has assets such as flour mills. As for the negotiations after Food Minister Xu came to Shanghai, Director Wu said that he did not know anything about it, only that Minister Xu was discussing with the Mayor.

### Allocation of Yangtze River Santeh Rice to Rice Shops

In order to maintain the people's livelihood, the authorities have allocated the Yangtze River Santeh and other stored rice to various rice shops to provide rice for retail sales. The work did not stop even on Sunday, and the allocation was completed by noon yesterday. At that time, the entrance of the Bank of China warehouse on Suzhou North Road was crowded with rice shop employees waiting for the goods to be shipped. It is reported that the rice allocated this time is entirely top-quality white rice produced in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang, and other places, and a total of 873 rice shops throughout the city were allocated, with each shop receiving 10 to 15 shi.

### District Prosecutor's Office; Interrogates Grain Loan Case This Morning

[Reported by this newspaper] The grain loan case is still being handled separately by the military and judicial organs. The District Prosecutor's Office will reopen the investigation court this morning, but Wang Daren, Ren Xingya, Wu Rongsheng, and Wang Xunzhi are still detained at the Garrison Headquarters. The headquarters sent a letter to the Accountants Association a few days ago, requesting them to send personnel to assist in auditing the accounts of grain merchants, but they have not yet received anyone as of yesterday. However, the Food Administration's reply has already been received. It is reported that the points Wang Daren mentioned in his confession involving the Food Administration are all facts.

### Xu Kan Speaks; Sichuan and Jiangxi Rice Being Transported Downstream; Land Tax in Kind and Local Tax Revenue Increased; Fair Judgment in the Grain Loan Case

Food Minister Xu Kan said yesterday: (1) This time, I was ordered by President Song to come to Shanghai to discuss the livelihood of the Shanghai people. In recent days, I have been following President's instructions and have had multiple discussions with Mayor Wu. Concrete decisions have been made on increasing rice sources, stabilizing prices, and managing the market. The 30,000 shi of Sichuan and Jiangxi rice transported by the Cai E and Jiang Yi ships under the Ministry have arrived in port on June 29th and 30th, respectively. We are continuing to increase transportation capacity in various ways and continuously transport rice downstream from Sichuan and Jiangxi, as well as purchasing and transporting foreign rice to balance the supply and demand of food in Shanghai. (2) The land tax will still be collected in kind this year, as decided by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. The Finance and Food Conference only discussed the implementation methods. Since the revision of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, the land tax in kind has become more important to local finances. The central government only receives 30%, while the provinces and counties receive 70%. Therefore, the land and grain agencies and grain collection businesses of each province have been transferred to the provincial governments for management since July 1st. The Food Administration is only in a supervisory and assessment position. (3) The decisions and methods regarding food have been carefully considered. If the staff has abandoned their duties or committed corruption, and if merchants have violated the law or engaged in malpractice, they have been reported and are now being tried by military and judicial authorities, and there will be a fair judgment.

### Zeng Yangfu Returns to Shanghai from the United States; Madam Sun Ke Arrives on the Same Ship

He met with reporters at 4 p.m. and talked about his visit to the United States. He had been to all major cities except North America and had extensively visited railway factories.

### Zheng Yongzhi, Ye Qianyu, Situ Huimin to Go to the US to Study Film Industry

Film Industry Colleagues Held Farewell Tea Party Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, colleagues from the Chinese film industry held a tea party at the New Life Club to bid farewell to Zheng Yongzhi, Ye Qianyu, and Situ Huimin, who are going to the United States to study the film industry. Around sixty to seventy figures from the film, theater, and literary and artistic circles attended, including Luo Jingyu, Shi Dongshan, Yuan Congmei, Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, Feng Hezi, Zhang Guangyu, Ding Cong, and Kang Jian. Guo Moruo also came, hurriedly signed his name and wrote a poem, and then hurriedly left, saying that he still had to visit Zeng Zhaolun. The tea party was chaired by Luo Jingyu, and Luo Xuelian and Xiong Foxi delivered farewell speeches. Xiong said, "American film techniques have undoubtedly reached their peak, but the consciousness and direction are still debatable." He hoped that "China's future film industry should develop among the people and become something shared by the masses." Shi Dongshan pointed out that everything in America is like water, and if used improperly, it could become the Yellow River, only producing flooding and destruction. He hoped it could become "West Lake." Miss Bai Yang's words were very brief. In a sweet and gentle voice, she wished the three travelers "smooth sailing."

Following this, Zheng, Ye, and Situ delivered farewell speeches. Zheng Yongzhi was formerly the director of the China Film Studio. This time, he is going to the United States on government orders to study film administration. Zheng said briefly: During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the more than eight hundred film workers in the rear areas endured great hardships, and some even sacrificed their lives, producing nearly a hundred films with crude tools. However, in terms of supporting the Anti-Japanese War, this was actually insufficient. Therefore, he wished to use the stones from other mountains to learn from. He hoped that those going to the United States would not only go to see, but also to experience and work in the field. Finally, he pointed out the three periods of the American film industry: the pre-war period was the commercial capital period, the wartime period was the government control period, and the future should be a democratic industrial period with the joint efforts of national industrialists.

Ye Qianyu is one of China's famous cartoonists (and also the creator of the cartoon character "Mr. Wang"). During the Anti-Japanese War, he devoted himself to painting and went to Xikang and India to collect painting materials. In mid-May of this year, he received an invitation from the US State Department, valid for one year, asking him to introduce modern Chinese cartoons to the New World. At the same time, he was also entrusted by "China Film Studio" to study the production of Hollywood cartoons. His state of mind, he called "very contradictory." He said, "At a time when all problems in China cannot be solved, going to the United States seems to have the suspicion of escaping reality." In his heart, he would very much like to stay here and work hard alongside his friends; but "in fact, what can be done by staying here?" His deep words showed the bitterness in his heart. The unrestful living environment seems to have made the emotions of every cultural worker sentimental and painful.

Situ Huimin is going "for personal reasons." The task given to him by "China Film Studio" is to study directing techniques. He will first go to Ottawa, Canada, to see the new developments in documentary films. He said, "My body and mind have been dedicated to this cause, and I am willing to work hard forever in this area for China's democracy and prosperity."

Zheng Yongzhi will board the "General Meigs" ship tonight and set off for the United States tomorrow morning. Ye and Situ will postpone their departure by two weeks because their ship tickets have not been arranged.

At around 5:00 PM, the tea party ended in a cordial atmosphere. The heavy rain outside the door temporarily kept the reluctant friends from parting.

### New Tricks Discovered in Former German Residents' Houses. Authorities Are Investigating the Truth.

House Allocation Begins Implementation. Few Cultural Institutions Benefit.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The House Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan, because German residents in this city will soon be repatriated, has allocated their houses to various institutions in advance. However, in recent days, more than half of the institutions have returned their allocation and acceptance documents. It is said that when these institutions went to take over the houses, only one of the originally assigned four rooms remained. Large rooms have become small rooms, and small rooms can only accommodate the space for a single military bed. It is clear that a "switch" has occurred. After learning of this, the committee, together with the German Residents Management Committee, went to various places for strict investigation, starting in six directions. The investigation will be completed this morning. Then, they will check against the roster previously registered by the German residents and reallocate accordingly. If it is found that the German residents have indeed committed fraud, they will be punished.

[Another News] The house allocation work of the House Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan for various institutions in Shanghai is about to begin. At the committee's regular meeting at 2:00 PM today, it may first allocate some of the houses applied for by various institutions, including a small number of cultural institutions. It is also learned that because a certain eight cultural institutions in this city are in dire need of housing, Mayor Wu has instructed the Municipal Government's Materials Receiving Office to allocate small shops that have been received for their use.

The House Allocation Committee held a subcommittee meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. It was decided that: (1) Approximately two hundred non-enemy-property houses currently occupied by Japanese residents will be allocated in advance. (2) The number of German residents being repatriated, which was originally about four hundred, has now increased, so the number of houses allocated in the future can also be increased. The above two points will be brought up for discussion at the regular meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon for a final decision.

### Wife of Director of Railways Bureau Embezzlement Case Flees

Total Embezzlement Exceeds 100 Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Railways Bureau discovered the shocking embezzlement case in the Materials Department of the Two Railways Bureau, it handed over Zhang Hongtu, the director of the department, Zhang Bokang, the section chief, and other related personnel to the bureau's police department for custody and interrogation on the 25th of last month. As of last night, the total amount of embezzlement uncovered reached 121,700,000 yuan, and Yu Xiangyan (张鸿图's wife), the main culprit related to the case, is still at large. Yesterday, Chen Bozhuang, director of the bureau, told reporters: "I deeply regret this case after it happened. After the interrogation, it has been found that no other personnel from other departments are involved except for the personnel from the Materials Department. According to the law, these criminal offenders should be sent to the judicial organs. However, because the amount of embezzlement is too large, I have ordered all related parties to first hand over all the funds within 48 hours to the public (that is, from 9:00 PM on the 1st to 8:00 PM on the 3rd), and then ask the Ministry of Communications for instructions."

Discovery Process

[Another News] Chen also recounted the embezzlement facts of Zhang Hongtu and the discovery process, saying: Zhang Hongtu, director of the Materials Department, from Liaoning, originally served as an assistant to the Materials Department of the Ministry of Communications. After the victory, the ministry sent him to assist me in receiving the Beijing-Shanghai railways, and then he was appointed as the director of the Materials Department. At the end of last year, instigated by his wife Yu Xiangyan (from Jiashan, addicted to opium), he began to embezzle small amounts, soliciting commissions for purchasing materials. Since March of this year, the personnel of our bureau have become stable, and I began to rectify the business, paying attention to materials first, so for more than a month, I did not dare to take commissions. However, in late April, Yu again instigated her husband to embezzle on a large scale, collecting commissions of 10% for all material purchases. Yu also directly solicited bribes as the director's wife. On May 29, a staff member of the purchasing section of the Materials Department secretly reported, and some others confessed, reporting in detail. I immediately conducted an investigation based on the report and ordered Deputy Director Hou to implement all matters related to the Materials Department. The embezzlement behavior of the department in soliciting commissions gradually subsided. Because the police department's personnel investigated effectively, the truth of the case has come to light. I am determined to handle it strictly according to the law.

Speeches

Chen Bozhuang specifically summoned more than 300 officers above the rank of director of the bureau to the auditorium at 8:45 PM last night to give speeches. In addition to reporting the details of the interrogation of the case, he hoped that all colleagues would cherish themselves, abide by the law, and pay attention to three points: spiritual construction, institutional construction, and technical construction. Regarding employee benefits, they have been adjusted since May of this year. The minimum salary is 100,700 yuan per month. In addition, employee welfare matters are being handled to ensure that employees' minimum living needs are met. However, he encouraged all colleagues to embrace the spirit of sacrifice and serve the country and the railway faithfully. Deputy Directors Luo Meilun, Hou or Hua Chen Fuhai gave speeches separately, encouraging all colleagues to earnestly follow the director's instructions.

### Tian Sheng Tang Chinese Medicine Store Kidnapping Case Solved; Young Hostage Rescued from Shantytown in Zhabei

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Tian Sheng Tang Chinese Medicine Store at 564 Yuyao Road was robbed of property by five or six armed bandits on the evening of the 19th of last month. When leaving, they kidnapped Chen Xiaomaotou, the five-month-old young owner, and fled. After the Criminal Police Division of the Municipal Police Bureau ordered police officers to work hard to investigate, they finally arrested the main culprit, Wang Ruizhong, in a shantytown in Zhabei on the 20th and rescued the young hostage on the spot. Later, accomplices Deng Ganchen, Yang Zhentao, Liu Laosi (also known as Liu Lang), Chen Keyou (also known as Xiaorenzi), and Sun Zhenhua were arrested one after another. Another suspect, Fan San, is still at large. According to Wang Ruizhong's confession: he is from Funing and used to be a plainclothes police officer at the Jinshan County Police Bureau. He is currently unemployed. At 8:00 PM on June 17, he gathered with Yang Zhentao, Deng Ganchen, Liu Laosi, Chen Keyou, Sun Zhenhua, and the fugitive Fan San at the Bund Park. At that time, Yang Zhentao led a woman named Sisao, who said that the Tian Sheng Tang Chinese Medicine Store on Yuyao Road was quite wealthy, with a single young child who was especially loved. If the child could be kidnapped, they could get 6 million to 10 million yuan. Everyone agreed and decided to act on the night of the 19th. When the store was closing, they took the opportunity to enter and robbed 200,000 yuan in cash, two gold rings, and a watch. When they left, Fan San took the young owner Chen Xiaomaotou away. The bandits had previously committed four theft cases, including 9 Ruiji Lane, Jiaxing Road, 23, Lane 768, Wuding Road, a certain number, Chang'an Road, Zhabei, and Tongxin Restaurant, 28 Huai'an Road. The rest of the criminals' confessions are the same. The interrogation has now been completed, and it is planned to submit the case to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation and handling in the coming days.

Feng Jie, from Guangdong, 43 years old, wearing a blue cloth long shirt and black cloth shoes, was thin and pale. According to his confession, he graduated from Guangdong Higher Normal School. He taught in Guangdong and Hong Kong before the Anti-Japanese War. He joined the puppet government in 1940 under the orders of the central government and worked for the central government in various ways during his time in the puppet government.

Rao Shu, from Wuhu, Anhui, wore a Huzhou silk long shirt in the morning when the trial began. He held a black paper fan in his hand, fanning himself from time to time, and answered boldly and shamelessly. According to him, he was ordered by the Central Statistics Bureau to work at the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, using false information from the Central Statistics Bureau to exchange for real information from the Japanese Embassy. After the August 13th Incident, he left. On September 22, 1940, he was arrested by Li Shiqun and his elderly mother and children were monitored, forcing him to join the puppet government. After considering for two months, he took on international intelligence, working as a translator of the English-language North China Daily News, and with the intention of saving the people in the occupied areas. Therefore, he said: "My betrayal is different from others. If I have done anything wrong to any Chinese, I am willing to be severely punished by the law and sentenced to death." As for his relationship with Gojima Shigeru, because his behavior did not seek high office or great wealth, Gojima admired him. Gojima believed in Buddhism and studied Mencius and Neo-Confucianism, and he knew him well. He was deeply influenced by him, so after he met him, he no longer killed a single person and always respected his opinions.

Sun Shaokang, from Jilin, 61 years old, wearing a gray silk long shirt, with a bald head and white hair, held a palm leaf fan in his hand. Before the hearing was over, he loudly said that he could not bear it and asked the court to give him tea so that he could take Rendan. The judge granted his request. According to Sun's confession: he was originally Dai Li's legal advisor. After Shanghai fell, Dai sent him to Shanghai to rescue underground comrades and began to take office in the puppet government. As for the reason for leaving office, it was because the concession had completely fallen and he could no longer do relief work, and his mother had passed away, so he was sad and left.

Cao Yaoting, a puppet prosecutor, Shen Xiaoyan, a puppet reporter, Shen Weiting, chairman of the puppet China Tobacco Company, and Zhang Bingheng and others were also questioned once. The above cases have been ordered to be retried at a later date.

### Workers May Not Stop Work Without Permission Except on Holidays

The Social Affairs Bureau Ordered Compliance to Emphasize Production

The Social Affairs Bureau stated that workers in various factories in this city occasionally take days off and stop work without authorization other than on prescribed holidays, resulting in wage and other disputes. Therefore, it issued a notice to all industry trade unions and industry associations yesterday, saying: "The dates for factory holidays are clearly stipulated by law. All non-holidays and government-prescribed holidays must not be stopped to emphasize production. If workers stop work without authorization outside of the prescribed dates, it will be regarded as absenteeism, and no wages will be paid, and factories are allowed to handle it in accordance with factory regulations.

### Relief for Refugees in Northern Jiangsu: All Circles Respond, 200 Million Disbursed as Raised

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association hosted the local press at the Pudong Association yesterday. Wu Kaixian, deputy chairman of the association, Wang Xianqing, general secretary, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. First, Mr. Wu Kaixian reported that the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu is a difficult task. It is estimated that the number of refugees is as high as 3 million. They are displaced and lack food and clothing. Among them, millions are in dire need of relief without the help of relatives and friends. They are now scattered in Xuzhou, Haizhou, Tongzhou, Taixian, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and this city. Zhenjiang has the most, about 200,000 people. Twenty-seven reception centers have been established. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the 行总 are providing relief, but the amount is very small. In the past two months, they have received relief, but each month can only get a bag of flour, which is not as abundant as what unemployed workers in Shanghai receive. In addition to the young refugees, who have youth training classes for training and job placement, women, children, and the elderly are about to become starved corpses. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee, has vowed to raise 2 billion yuan from July 1 to August 31, disbursing to Zhenjiang as the funds are raised, because disaster relief is like putting out a fire, and no delay is allowed.

The current work situation is roughly as follows: (1) Mr. Du Yuesheng has first borrowed 500 million from 14 banks in the city without interest, which will be remitted within one or two days. (2) Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xingyan, and myself have invited famous actors and performers to perform for charity for ten days, and they have all expressed their willingness to do so. The location has been set at the Tianchan Stage. (3) Within this week, the city's radio stations will also join the fundraising efforts. (4) In addition to the above-mentioned groups, employees and dancers in all dance halls in the city have also voluntarily contributed, planning to donate all of their income for one day, without deducting expenses, to benefit the disaster victims. Speaking to this point, Director Wu said in a humorous tone: "I never dance, but I hope everyone will go dancing more on this day and eat more things. You must know that if they don't eat, the refugees will have nothing to eat; if they don't dance, the refugees will jump into the river!" Wu Zhilao has agreed to write to the mayor, asking the municipal government to also exempt the entertainment tax for the dance halls on that day, so that more disaster victims can benefit.

The association has now established eight fundraising teams, with sub-teams under them, without a limit on the number, and is in the process of organizing. It has also commissioned six banks, including Jin Cheng, Jiao Tong, Jiangsu, Xinhua, Jiangsu Farmers, and China General Chamber of Commerce, to receive donations. All generous benefactors can go directly to these six banks to make payments. In the future, all donations will be swept to Zhenjiang by these six banks. All office expenses in Shanghai will be paid by the organizers, and no donations will be used. Later, Wang Xianqing expressed his gratitude, briefly mentioning the motivation for fundraising, which is entirely due to the humanitarian and universal spirit of mutual assistance, and he deeply believes that results will be achieved soon. At this point, the meeting was adjourned in the midst of a gale and heavy rain.

### Major Thunderstorm in the City

At 6:30 PM in the evening, thunderstorms returned with renewed intensity. As yesterday coincided with the scheduled atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll, it heightened the sensitivity of some citizens, who speculated that the sudden and violent weather was related to the bomb, a notion that can be described as wildly imaginative.

### Naked Body with Knife Wounds Discovered in Pudong

Yesterday, a male corpse, estimated to be in his twenties or thirties, was discovered in a deserted grave south of Mengjiazhai Bridge in Yangjing Town, Pudong.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### On the Position of District Offices and the Authority of District Chiefs

—Zhang Xiaosong

Currently, some people believe that with the establishment of police bureau branches, the establishment of district offices is redundant and unnecessary. The police bureau can handle the organization and guidance of Baojia, and the investigation and management of household registration. Others argue that the merging of false and Baoding (I'm not sure about how to translate 保合一 so this remains as it is) has made Baojia and the police integrated, becoming a complete police governance, with the police managing the autonomous institutions, which is not in line with the purpose of local autonomy. Therefore, district praises are needed, but district offices can only be considered as units for handling Baojia and relocation matters. If the district offices are to handle both Baojia and election matters, while also handling administrative affairs, it would conflict with the administrative system and authority of various bureaus.

The above two views are wrong. We need to make everyone understand the position of the district offices and the authority of the district chiefs. Without much citation or theoretical discussion, we can understand by studying the municipal organizational law.

Article 6 of the municipal organizational law: "Below the city is the district, and the organization within the district is Baojia…" This clearly explains the position of the district, which constitutes the municipal organization and occupies a position between the municipal government and Baojia.

Article 34 of the municipal organizational law states: "Each district shall have a district praise, with one district chief and one deputy district chief, elected by the district people's representative assembly, under the supervision and direction of the municipal government, to handle autonomous matters in the district and execute matters delegated by the municipal government." This explains the authority of the district chief, who is under the supervision and direction of the municipal government, handling autonomous matters in the district and executing matters delegated by the municipal government.

Due to the explicit provisions of Article 11 of the municipal organizational law, the district office is an institution that forms the city and is located between the municipal government and Baojia, which is different from the branches of the police bureau. Article 34 also clearly stipulates the authority of the district chief. The establishment of the district office is not only free from the unnecessary redundancy, but is also an important institution for handling local autonomy and executing municipal government orders, proving that it is not simply an agency for handling elections.

We believe that the work of the municipal government, aiming at all benefits and the elimination of malpractices, is for the citizens. The organization of citizens is Baojia, and the local autonomy The public opinion organization at the level is the Bao Min assembly. In the district, there is also a district people's congress, and the district chief is generated through the election of the district people's congress. On the one hand, he is responsible to the district people's congress, and at the same time, he must guide the autonomous business of Baojia throughout the district. Therefore, all matters that are beneficial to citizens, after being resolved by the Bao Min Assembly and the District People's Congress, as long as they do not conflict with the central and municipal laws and regulations, he has the obligation to enforce.

One more point to be explained is that when the district office accepts the resolutions of the district people's congress, or accepts the suggestions of the Bao Min assembly and Baojia chiefs, and handles autonomous affairs, if it involves hygiene, it should of course be reported to the Bureau of Hygiene; if it involves land administration, it should of course be reported to the Bureau of Land Administration; if it involves public works, it should of course be reported to the Bureau of Public Works; if it involves social welfare, it should of course be reported to the Bureau of Social Affairs. The same can be inferred for the rest of the bureaus. According to their authority, the various bureaus of the municipal government have the authority to direct and supervise the handling of all matters, unless they believe that it is unnecessary or conflicts with laws and regulations, in which case they will not approve or order amendments. So, what is the conflict?

Standing in the position of civil servants, in the current democratic era, we should consider for ourselves what political efficiency we have achieved in the past when our government monopolized politics and did not allow the people to do things. We believe that the power of the people is infinite. We believe that the people can handle autonomous matters and matters that are closely related to their own interests quickly and well, as long as we supervise and direct them. Why not allow them to do it themselves?

### District People's Representative Assemblies to be Convened by the 5th of this Month

The district people's representatives of this city were elected in April of this year. However, most of the elected representatives have not submitted their public service inspections, which has prevented the convening of the establishment meeting. It is learned that in order to actively establish grassroots democracy and ensure the smooth implementation of local autonomy, the municipal government has ordered all district offices to convene the district people's representative establishment meeting before July 5th of this year, elect the chairman of the representative assembly, and continue to convene the first representative meeting to discuss matters that should be improved in various districts.

### Enemy and Puppet Requisition of Field Tax and Food; Registration to be Opened in Various Districts on Schedule

According to Article 3 of the Measures for the Requisition of Field Tax in Kind, the field tax and food requisitioned by the enemy and puppets in the restored area during the period of enemy occupation should be allowed to be registered by the people with the same tax payment certificate, so as to clear the price against the enemy. This city stipulates that the registration period is from July 15th to September 15th, two months. In the 14th, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 29th, 30th, 31st, and 9th districts, the Baojia will issue registration forms in triplicate. The grain households will fill out the registration forms and submit them to the Baojia, who will forward them to the Finance Bureau for registration. Grain households in other districts will apply to the Finance Bureau for registration during the registration period. The Civil Affairs Office has sent letters to the praise in various districts yesterday, urging them to handle it seriously.

### Eighteenth District Election Lawsuit - Wei Yu-nong Loses

In the city's 18th district's election for a senator, Wei Yu-nong, the third alternate senator elected in that district, sued the district office for election irregularities and fraud. The case was heard by the Shanghai District Court, regarding election ballots. Yesterday, the court pronounced its judgment, dismissing Wei Yu-nong's lawsuit. The plaintiff shall bear the litigation costs.

According to the person in charge of the Civil Affairs Department, a total of eight election lawsuits arose from this city councilor election. Except for two cases withdrawn by the plaintiffs, the remaining six cases have been adjudicated by the Shanghai District Court. The entire election has been determined to be valid. Once the Ministry of the Interior approves the public notice to the city, the inaugural meeting can be convened.

### Death of Weng Jian-guang

Weng Jian-guang, the elected councilor for the city's 12th district (Jiangmi District), passed away at the age of 33. Originally from Ningbo, Zhejiang, he graduated from Guanghua University and successively served as Director of the Political Department of the Army and Chief Secretary of the National Reserve Army General Headquarters. He was the current Chairman of Jingxin Glass Factory and General Manager of Jianda Timber Firm. He passed away due to illness at 5:00 AM on the 28th of last month. Upon hearing the news, various parties expressed their condolences. His seat as a city councilor will be filled by Shao Yong-sheng from the same district, according to law.

### Ninth District Implementing Comprehensive Cleaning

The city's ninth district, located in the western suburbs, is inferior to other districts in terms of environmental hygiene. With the recent outbreak of epidemics, District Head Yao, in order to encourage residents to pay attention to hygiene and prevent the spread of disease, has specifically scheduled a district-wide cleaning campaign on the 2nd of this month. At that time, in addition to the full mobilization of Baojia (neighborhood administrative unit) personnel for supervision, letters will also be sent to the police precinct, health center, and cleaning team to assist in the persuasion efforts.

### Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Household Registration Law (II)

(Article 8) To carry out household surveys, the provincial government, or the county government under the order of the provincial government, should set a survey date. Before the start of the household survey, Baojia (neighborhood administrative units) should be organized. Counties that have already organized Baojia may reorganize Baojia during the household survey. However, once the Bao system is determined, it cannot be changed without the approval of the provincial government. The organization or reorganization of Baojia should be completed ten days before the survey date.

(Article 9) The Baojia organization is based on households. Ten households form a Jia, and ten Jia form a Bao. When there is a need for increase or decrease, a Jia can consist of six to fifteen households, and a Bao can consist of six to fifteen Jia.

In cities, a Jia consists of ten to thirty households, and a Bao consists of ten to thirty Jia.

### Solving the Food Problem for Shanghai Citizens - Ministry of Food to Allocate 50,000 Shi First - Foreign Rice Orders Expected to Arrive Within the Month - 70,000 Bags of Brazilian Rice Imported This Morning

[Reported by this newspaper] The "Azalea City" managed by Wah Lun Foreign Firm, transporting a large quantity of rice, 73,019 bags from Brazil, 24,601 bags of flour, 4,602 bales of cotton. These items are from the Relief Agency. Commercial cotton amounts to 8,286 bales, over 1,000 copper plates, and 400 boxes of coffee. Over 70,000 bags of rice were originally scheduled to be unloaded in Kowloon, but now changed to be unloaded in this city. The ship was scheduled to arrive yesterday and dock at the Blue Funnel Wharf. However, it had not arrived by 1 PM. According to the firm, if it could not arrive yesterday, it would definitely arrive this morning.

After the price of rice in this city was determined by the free authorities, the market immediately showed signs of both explicit and implicit tightening. Illegal activities are emerging endlessly. Merchants are using the excuse of high purchase prices and lack of profit, leading to the stalling of the procurement and transportation work. Rice shops are also using the excuse of difficulty in obtaining spot goods, and arbitrarily suspending sales. President Song, Minister Xu, and Mayor Wu, among others, have been meeting for several days and have already worked out concrete measures. The Ministry of Food will allocate 50,000 dan, of which 1,700 tons (approximately 17,000 large bags) is Jiangxi rice, which was loaded onto ships a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai. In addition, of the foreign rice shipped from Annam to Shanghai last time, apart from some that has been transported to Huaguang, there are still 7,000 large bags, which have also been allocated to supplement. The remaining 20,000 dan will be allocated separately by the Ministry of Food. The rice previously ordered by the Ministry of Food from foreign countries is also expected to arrive within the month, at which time it will be re-distributed. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, Minister Xu and Lu Zuofu, the manager of Minsheng Shipping Company, also discussed ways to strengthen the transport of Sichuan rice to Shanghai, and concrete decisions were made.

### Design Committee for Imported Goods Began Work Yesterday

The Specialized Committee for the Design of Imported Goods began its work yesterday. Director Li and Deputy Director Sheng Zhuosan both arrived at the meeting yesterday (1st) to work. According to Li and Sheng, the committee is a research unit. In order to achieve a balance in international trade, the government needs to ensure a continuous flow of imported materials, allowing export goods to be exported in large quantities, so as to avoid the current situation of excessive imports. The current establishment is in its initial stage, and the exact situation is not yet clear. Only preparatory work has begun. In the future, if anything is gained, it will be reported to the Economic Council for reference. It is reported that the committee will convene experts in Beijing for consultation before formally launching research. The committee has already begun investigating various imported materials.

### Famine Expected to Continue for Two More Years - South Africa Also Insufficient for Self-Sufficiency

[United Press Washington, 30th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that the world food shortage will continue for at least two years. Today, it announced to farmers nationwide to increase wheat planting area to increase the recovery in 1947. The target is 71,700,000 plants. The current harvest is about 1,033,000,000 bushels.

[United Press Johannesburg, 30th] South Africa is experiencing a severe food shortage. In some cities, crowds queuing to buy bread in front of stores. This is due to the disaster. In the past, South Africa has been able to export about 700,000 [measurement unknown] of grain each year, but now it is insufficient for self-sufficiency.

### Cotton Cloth Market Stable

During the holiday, the cotton cloth market saw some transactions, due to the needs of the Benton City and dyeing factory. The V brand was at $55,500, and scrap debt was at $57,000, up $500 from the previous day. Other transactions were not reported. People's sentiments remained stable.

### Scarcity of Fine Woolens

Various fine wool fabrics woven from fine wool threads, such as [brands in Chinese, names of fabrics], have been in short supply recently, and prices are rising. The factory's production is low, and the arrival of foreign goods is only a rumor. Although American goods have arrived, they are generally of poor quality, such as [names of fabrics]. Buyers and sellers are both disappointed. It is reported that if the sailors do not strike, the next batch of [names of fabrics] will be shipped in large quantities by the end of this month, with excellent quality. Moreover, all woolen companies have few fine wool sales, especially the [brand name].

### Yantai's Famous Handicraft - Hairnet Production Declines

Jinan and Yantai's handicraft industries have always been developed. Products like hairnets, yarn, flower cushions are all produced in these two places. Before the war, they also occupied an important position in exports. After the war, because these two places were occupied by the Communist army, workers fled, resulting in a decline in production. It is reported that domestic hairnets were in short supply a month ago. Only last week, a certain foreign firm shipped 5,000 luo, each luo containing 144 pieces. Although there is a large demand abroad for yarn flower cushions, the price limit set by American merchants is far from the domestic cost, so very few are exported.

### Sugar Prices Eased Yesterday

Yesterday, the sugar market eased because it was reported that medium sugar had arrived. And silver and grain were tight. Sentiment turned. The association's quota was slightly lower than the weekend by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The market was stable at the beginning, and eventually loosened. The opening price was $116,000, once down to $117,000 to $118,000, then to $114,000. The total fall was over $5,000. Road goods were $100,700 to $102,000, down $7,000. The fifth-period building orders were $114,000 to $112,500, then to $110,000, down $7,000. Raw sugar was $106,000. Numbered goods, the old leader helped to open hundreds of packages of ice-flower-white, at $137,000 to $133,000. More than a hundred packages of cotton-red were $124,000-$125,000. There were no big fluctutations. Dozens of packages of Huanggang green were at $100,000, down $2,000. Forty [measurement unclear] of second-grade ice sugar were at $145,000.

### Taiwan Sugar Company Revises Regulations - Delivery Limited to 10 Days

Also reported, according to the person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company, Taiwan sugar will arrive today and tomorrow. In the future, the allocated quantity is limited. The regulations stipulate that customers must pick up the goods within 10 days. Overdue is invalid. The previous regulation that customers only need to pay warehousing and insurance fees without time limits for previous customers holding warehouse receipts has been abolished to avoid hoarding.

### Lack of Funds and Fertilizers - Taiwan Sugar Production Sharply Reduced - Conversations with the Sichuan-Kang Delegation After the Investigation

Over ten representatives of the National Assembly from Sichuan and Guangxi provinces, including Lu Chao, Leng Pu-ke, Ping Tie-fu, Chuan Chang, and Li [missing character], etc., organized a Taiwan inspection group after attending the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly in Beijing. They went to Taiwan for inspection in early June, paying particular attention to Taiwan's economic situation. The group has now returned to Beijing. According to Li Tie-tian, who came to Shanghai, Taiwan was under enemy rule and economic undertakings were controlled by the enemy. The Japanese regarded Taiwan as their industrial warehouse, spending large sums of money each year on sugar production and providing fertilizers, etc. After the war, Taiwan's sugar industry faced problems with capital and fertilizers, resulting in a sharp decline in production. The delegation has reported the findings to the government and suggested that the Taiwanese manufacturing machines be transferred in batches to Guangzhou and Sichuan for continued production.

### Shanghai American Businesses are Doing Well

[Central News Agency New York, 29th Special Dispatch] Ford, Chairman of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Committee, issued a statement today, saying that although China's political and economic situation has not been resolved and foreign exchange controls are strict, American businesses are still able to transact with China in various ways. The businesses of 100 American companies with branches or representatives in Shanghai in the past few months are all reporting that they are doing well. Ford said: "The current unrest in China is the main reason why trade cannot be restored to the same extent as port trade." The Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Committee hopes that after China's economic recovery, Sino-American trade will be a fair trade for both parties.

### Longkou Vermicelli Rises Again

The Longkou vermicelli market remains active due to continued consumption and limited arrivals. Therefore, market prices have risen repeatedly without easing. The current asking price for Longkou vermicelli in the market has reached $190,000. The trade [missing character] is rising as well.

### British Five Measures to Prevent Inflation

[United Press London, 30th] The British government is preparing to take five steps to curb inflation. But this requires the traditional patience of the British people to avoid any sudden economic turmoil. The government's plan includes: levying heavy taxes, compiling prices, quantitative rationing, conservation movements, and trying to increase production. British clothing, automobiles, train tickets, and freight rates are increasing with time. According to the "Economist" weekly, "The crisis of inflation is more serious now than at any time in the past six years."

### Handling the Atomic Bomb Problem is the Best Test of Human Wisdom

— ...Translated by this newspaper...

The invention of the atomic bomb has placed humanity at a historical crossroads: One path can lead to greater prosperity, progress, a further increase in living standards, and closer relations between nations, leaping from the current world to a world of atomic energy; the other path can lead to deeper taboos, hatred, collective destruction of life, universal suffering of culture, and allowing what humans have invented to kill humans. Which path will we take? This depends on human wisdom to decide.

The current question is how should humans handle the atomic bomb? How should we deal with the global situation created by the invention of the atomic bomb? Combining reports from various parties, the proposition that the United Nations organization should control atomic energy has become the most prevalent idea today. Scientists who invented the atomic bomb are particularly active about controlling the atomic bomb.

Regarding the issue of international control of atomic energy, there are currently two basic hypotheses: (1) All countries must allow inspectors from the United Nations organization to freely enter their territories, without any restrictions; (2) The production and use of radioactive elements in various countries must be monopolized by the government. Therefore, inspectors from the United Nations organization can concentrate their attention and do not have to be distracted in all aspects.

But whether countries around the world are willing to comply is indeed a big problem. For example, can the Soviet Union allow United Nations inspectors to enter its territory without restrictions? Is the United States willing to restrict the production of radioactive elements and not use them in civil industries to improve people's living standards? In fact, it is not only the United States and the Soviet Union that are like this, many other countries are the same. Therefore, it is still quite far from achieving this goal.

Secondly, even if countries agree to international control of atomic energy, can it avoid atomic bomb wars in this generation or the next generation? The answer is also no. Because the so-called control is only to supervise governments not to manufacture atomic bombs or other atomic weapons, and to use atomic energy for industrial purposes or conduct research in laboratories, which is still possible. According to scientists, the technology for manufacturing radioactive materials is neither secret nor difficult. In the next ten years, at least eight or ten countries can produce radioactive materials. Suppose that in ten or fifteen years, there are already atomic energy factories in some countries around the world. These factories are either under international control or supervised by United Nations organizations, guaranteeing that the radioactive materials produced therein are indeed used to generate energy and never to produce atomic bombs. Suppose again that all countries do not have atomic bombs and still maintain aircraft, rockets, navies, bombs, and standing armies. But because the fundamental problems of international politics have not been resolved, the situation can still worsen, reaching the point of armed conflict. Once the war starts, all international controls will naturally collapse immediately. In this case, countries can use the knowledge about atomic energy previously obtained in factories and laboratories to immediately start manufacturing atomic bombs and can achieve this in a few months at most. Therefore, even if international control of atomic energy is completely successful, it is only a delaying tactic, not a fundamental solution.

So, is there no hope of avoiding atomic war in this generation or the next generation? The answer is that there is very little hope. Humanity's ability to produce destructive tools has completely exceeded its ability to create political control tools, resembling the tortoise and the hare in a race.

The only way to prevent future wars is that, in addition to international control of atomic energy, the United Nations organization must possess weapons that general countries do not have and cannot manufacture, including atomic bombs. Once an act of aggression occurs in the world, no matter its nature, the United Nations organization must immediately have the power to stop it. If the United Nations organization is to truly play a role, then the veto power of individual countries must also be abolished, so that the Security Council can take swift and effective action. In other words, on the one hand, there must be a world government with real power, and on the other hand, countries must implement disarmament under supervision.

Humanity must open the door to progress. How to handle the atomic bomb problem is indeed the best test of human wisdom. The future destiny of the world is not determined by the gods, but by the minds of humans. (Excerpted and translated from "Harper's" magazine)

### Preparations for the Atomic Bomb Test

— …Materials Office of this Newspaper…

In order to determine the explosive power of the atomic bomb and its impact on the Navy, the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force originally scheduled to jointly conduct a test of the atomic bombing of warships in Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean on the 15th of [missing character] month. Later, in order to facilitate more members of Congress to visit (this is the explanation of White House Press Secretary Rose), the date was extended to July 1 near the Bikini Atoll. The island is about 21 miles long and reportedly about 11 miles wide. The island has only 167 indigenous people. After a vote, they were willing to [missing character] Longiriec Island, 135 miles east, and evacuation began in late February.

The procedure for the atomic bomb test is prescribed as follows: The first bomb will explode several hundred feet above the parked [Japanese missing character] ship. The second bomb will explode at sea level, and it is expected that it will raise a tidal wave as high as 100 feet, causing the greatest damage. The third bomb will explode several thousand feet underwater, and the pressure will cause the hull to implode.

The B-29 Flying Fortress from the US 509th Mixed Air Group will participate in the test. These aircraft are unmanned and will take off, hover, and land by themselves using radio control. The warships, battleships, destroyers, cruisers, transports, landing craft, and submarines prepared to be attacked during the test also include the German cruiser "Prinz Eugen" and the Japanese battleship "Nagato." Of course, there are no humans on the ships, but various weapons such as aircraft, artillery, tanks, mobile radar, and radio equipment are placed, and in order to test the effect of the atomic bomb on organisms, animals such as pigs, rats, cattle, and sheep will be loaded to replace living people. At the same time, automatic recording robots will be placed on the coral island to make various measurements.

Only the representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission of the United Nations organization are allowed to visit the atomic bomb test. The representatives of the association include China, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Canada, Australia, Egypt, the Netherlands, and Mexico in addition to the United States. About 200 reporters are allowed to visit on ships [missing character] 8 to 10 miles away. About 150 warships are watching around. During the test, representatives of several major news organizations in the United States will use [missing character] radio and photography to quickly spread the entire process of the test to the world.

### Atomic Bomb Test Photography

Yesterday's atomic bomb test on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific may become the best-documented scientific experiment in many years. The atomic bomb explosion will be photographed from various angles with remote-controlled and long-range cameras, including photographs and radar images. Some will be taken from airplanes, and some from fixed points. Radio-controlled cameras are placed on 100-foot-high towers, these towers are strong enough to withstand the force of the wind caused by the atomic bomb explosion. They will not be placed farther than five to ten miles from ground zero. The cameras are placed in houses with thick lead walls, and each camera is placed in a sealed and waterproof box. The photography is done through window openings, which will automatically close after the explosion to prevent radiation from affecting the film.

The cameras need special protective devices to withstand the extremely high heat emitted by the atomic bomb explosion. A thin film will be placed on the lens of the camera. Due to the effect of light, this film will be removed after the flash of the explosion. The reason for this film is likely because the heat from the explosion would pass through the lens, causing the unexposed film to melt due to reaching its flash point.

The results of the photographic recordings will not be known for several weeks after the experiment, as radiation prevents people from approaching the camera towers. Photographs taken by what are called Fairchild Radar Cameras can be obtained earlier, as they are taken from remotely controlled aircraft or from ordinary aircraft at an altitude of 30,000 feet.

### Humor Regarding the Atomic Bomb Test

— …Compiled by this newspaper's editorial department…

Remember the Bible's "Genesis," which says that during the ancient flood, Noah and his wife received divine inspiration, ordering them to take a pair of each kind of bird and beast to avoid disaster on the Ark, waiting for the small island to have grass before returning the boat, so the flood could recede. The result was miraculously fulfilled, and various animals were able to survive in the world. (See picture above)

In the atomic bomb test, animals such as pigs, rats, rabbits, and sheep were placed on the "target ship," as stand-ins for humans. (See picture below)

Yesterday morning, the first test atomic bomb exploded, and the pigs, rats, rabbits, and sheep may have all perished.

This painting is a recent work by an English marine painter, titled "Progress?" A comparison of the past and present is thought-provoking. (Reported by The New York Times)

### Revisiting the Old Atomic Bomb Case

— Compiled by this newspaper's research department

Hiroshima Attacked

On August 5th of last year, U.S. Army Colonel Tibbets piloted a B-29 Flying Fortress and dropped the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Japan, using a parachute, producing a world-shocking effect. The pillar shot straight into the sky, reaching a height of 20,000 feet. According to President Truman's report, the bomb's destructive power exceeded 20,000 tons of TNT explosives.

Nagasaki Suffers

In the early morning of August 9th, another B-29 Superfortress dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. According to the description of British Air Force Group Captain Cheshire, who witnessed the scene at the time, when the bomb exploded, he only felt that the observation plane he was on suddenly received a violent impact, and at the same time felt that the world outside the aircraft body was illuminated extraordinarily. When he looked out, he only saw a terrifying large fireball, estimated to have a temperature of 10 million degrees Celsius, followed by a huge gray smoke pillar, pushing the fireball straight into the sky, about 5,000 feet above the ground. Within the fire column, intense flames rotated and soared, continuously spewing fire. The fireball and smoke column continued to rise and spew fire until, two minutes later, it had reached a height of 20,000 feet. The fireball at the top of the column had turned into a transparent sulfur color, and the black smoke at the bottom of the smoke column spread in all directions, mixing with the dust from the affected ground. At this time, a vast area of ground was ablaze with raging fire, quickly spreading. Twenty minutes after the explosion, the smoke and fire column had risen to a height of 60,000 feet, its shape gradually resembling a huge cloud. The entire Nagasaki below was destroyed in smoke and fire.

The Tragic Scene After the Bombing

Hiroshima after the bombing had become a desolate wasteland of scorched earth, with no green grass growing, and tree trunks resembling coke. Within two miles of the atomic bomb's detonation point, various vehicles were blasted and thrown more than a thousand feet above the ground before crashing back down, becoming heaps of scrap. Because Nagasaki had small by dividing the city, the damage was less severe than in Hiroshima. Within the bombed area, the copper and iron wreckage of factories lay scattered and piled up in a mess.

Atomic Ailments

Furthermore, residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were bombed by atomic bombs, although not dying immediately, often died several weeks later. According to experts' reports: the majority of residents were exposed to radium-like rays from the atomic bomb explosion, penetrating deep into the blood vessel tissues in the bone marrow, disrupting all blood functions. The blood could no longer clot, white blood cells disappeared, bacteria ran rampant, and the afflicted eventually died within two or three weeks. In addition, many people contracted so-called "atomic disease," with strange ailments such as hair loss, tooth loss, burns, nerve disorders, gynecological problems, purpura, and massive bleeding. The strangest thing was that some women with irregular menstruation were treated by the atomic bomb blast.

### One Wave Subsides, Another Rises! The Yu Zhaoqi Case Occurs in Hong Kong, Our Country's Law Encounters a New Trial

— Hong Kong Airmail, June 29th, Special Correspondent Lin Youlan

The laws of one country are naturally different from the laws of another country, and there is a great distance between the laws of one country and the laws of another country's colony, which is inevitably the case. Therefore, both sides must understand each other, respect each other, and strive for the "same" amidst the "different." Neither side should stubbornly hold onto "going its own way," using the rule of law in name while "breaking the law" in practice, or even intentionally protecting figures who harm the other side's sovereignty or create events that harm the other side's sovereignty. Only then can a path to cooperation be found and mutual friendship enhanced. Since Generalissimo Chiang, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the China Theater, ordered British Navy Rear Admiral Harcourt to represent him in accepting the surrender of the Japanese forces in Hong Kong, the situation in Hong Kong has undergone a new transformation. However, some British officials who returned to Hong Kong disregarded the current reality and remained fixated on their old tricks of ruling the colony, seeming to feel unconcealed jealousy towards our country's new status in Hong Kong. It has often been heard that the Hong Kong government authorities and our military and political personnel stationed in Hong Kong have directly experienced friction, indirectly creating a negative impact on Sino-British relations, especially the recent incident in which the Kuomintang Daily was ordered to cease publication, which was the most significant. This reporter has made a detailed report on the ins and outs of the incident, which is believed to be known to people in the country. Now, less than two days after enlightened figures in the Hong Kong government, in order to cherish Sino-British friendship, partially lifted the ban on the Kuomintang Daily, another "Yu Zhaoqi incident" occurred. Let me tell my compatriots who are concerned about the Hong Kong issue about what happened:

### To Maintain Military Discipline, the Guangdong Headquarters Orders the Arrest of Yu Zhaoqi

On the 26th, this newspaper and major newspapers published a message stating: "Military Affairs Commission Councilor Yu Zhaoqi, in his capacity as a soldier, engaged in commercial activities in Hong Kong, violating army regulations. Upon receiving the report, Director Zhang of the Guangzhou Headquarters, in order to maintain military discipline, specially telegraphed Major General Guo Naqi, the Special Inspector stationed in Hong Kong and Kowloon, to escort him to Guangdong for investigation." After receiving the order, how did Major General Guo handle it? According to Major General Guo's statement to the Kuomintang Daily reporter who visited him on the 28th:

"I (Guo referred to himself) received a telegram from Director Zhang on the 23rd of this month, ordering me to immediately arrest Yu Zhaoqi and send him to the province for interrogation. I immediately executed the order, notifying Mr. Yu to visit my residence on the same day. Mr. Yu arrived as scheduled, and I informed Mr. Yu that Director Zhang had telegraphed, ordering him to go to the province to await orders. After hearing this, he immediately took the telegram to read, and after reading it, he asked me how I would handle the matter. I told him to take the Xian Wheel to the province on the next day (i.e., the 24th). He agreed at the time, but said that he had unfinished private matters in Hong Kong and asked to be allowed to cross over to Hong Kong once. I immediately ordered the commander of the Kowloon Gendarmerie Company to monitor his actions. Unexpectedly, after he returned to his bedroom at the Peninsula Hotel from Hong Kong, there were British military police patrolling and guarding outside his bedroom, and he was strictly ordered not to go to the province for the time being. Upon hearing the news, I told the British military police that this was a matter of our military discipline and should be monitored by our military police. Both our military police and the British military police guarded outside Mr. Yu's door. Before long, the British military police captain apologized to me, saying that this was an order from above to guard Mr. Yu. At around 3:00 a.m. that night, just as I was falling asleep, General Festing, the commander of the British Army, sent a special boat to pick me up, saying that there was an important matter to discuss. I crossed the sea to the British Army Headquarters. In addition to General Festing, the Hong Kong Auxiliary Secretary McDonald and a Westerner were present. They talked to me about Yu Zhaoqi's matter, saying that Mr. Yu had now resigned and was an ordinary civilian, so extradition methods should be used. They also took out Mr. Yu's letter of dismissal from March of this year as proof. I immediately explained our country's army system, which is divided into two types: 'official' and 'position'. 'Position' can be temporarily transferred or dismissed, while 'official' belongs to the rank of officer and is permanent in nature. Unless the officer's rank is revoked due to some reason or he has been ordered to retire, he is still a soldier of our country. At that time, the two sides studied and argued until 4:00 a.m. I, being unclear about the key point, raised an opinion regarding the responsibility for guarding Mr. Yu in order to clarify responsibilities. At that time, General Festing requested that the British side guard him. I had no preconceived notions about which side should guard him, but the procedures must be clear and the responsibilities must be clear. General Festing then wrote a letter for the record to take responsibility. If our side requests an interrogation, the British side will be responsible for handing him over. After this consultation, I have already telegraphed Director Zhang for instructions."

According to the Hong Kong Telegraph, translated and published in the Hong Kong Business Daily on the 27th, under the headline "Disturbance at the Peninsula Hotel," the report stated the following regarding the process of Mr. Yu's arrest:

"Mr. Yu has recently been in Hong Kong for private matters. According to usually reliable reports, he was indeed arrested by Chinese military police on Monday afternoon, but he managed to escape and received the protection of the Hong Kong police. It is heard that he persuaded his captors to return with him to the Peninsula Hotel so that he could retrieve some clothing. At this point, Mr. Yu called the police."

"The first sign that the attempted arrest of Yu Zhaoqi had been discovered by ordinary people was when an armed Chinese military policeman entered the officers' club of the Peninsula Hotel on Monday evening and sat down just inside the entrance. Upon seeing an armed Chinese military policeman arrive, Mr. Yu returned to his room on the fourth floor, and an air force policeman was dispatched to guard him. Two people spent the night in Mr. Yu's room, while another person guarded the corridor outside the door."

### Yu is Proficient in English, Claiming He "Contributed to Britain" and Received a Medal

What kind of person is Yu Zhaoqi exactly? The Ming Pao once recorded that "Mr. Yu grew up in Hong Kong. When the Japanese attacked Hong Kong, he worked for the British as a counter-fifth column and spy, making extremely significant contributions." He was awarded a medal for his contributions to Britain during the Burma campaign. Other famous newspapers have made brief records, but the most detailed information was in the New Life Evening Post on the 28th, which also pointed out that Mr. Yu had expressed his agreement with the British construction of the Ping Shan Airport. It also confirmed that Mr. Yu was not a native of Hong Kong. Mr. Yu had gone to England to study at a young age, etc. According to its full text:

"Mr. Yu is in his forties, strongly built, and neatly dressed. He often wears military uniforms in Hong Kong, with shining medals. He has a small mustache on his lips, neatly trimmed and clean, seeming dignified. He speaks boldly and is particularly proficient in English. Therefore, he interacts with Westerners and Europeans and has a close relationship with them. He is not bound by details and is not subject to popular opinions, which is particularly commendable as his characteristic."

"This spring, the Ping Shan Airport issue was attracting attention from both China and abroad, and the discussions were heated. Mr. Yu once gave a speech in the Overseas Chinese Daily, expressing his strong support for this move, believing that it would greatly benefit both China and Britain. He was also a figure often mentioned by reporters in public gatherings in this city."

"Mr. Yu lives on the fourth floor of the Peninsula Hotel. His wife went to England to study at the beginning of the year, while he often goes to the officers' club for recreation, and most of the people he associates with are prominent British military figures."...

### The Development of the Situation, Concerning Our Military Law and Sovereignty

Because Mr. Yu and General Chen Ce once had that relationship, this reporter inquired about General Chen's friends in Hong Kong. According to them, Mr. Yu only served as General Chen's interpreter at the time. After Mr. Yu returned to the country, General Chen noticed that his "behavior was suspicious" and notified the Guangdong Provincial authorities to detain Mr. Yu in Qujiang. From then on, General Chen's relationship with Yu was cut off.

Since the Yu Zhaoqi incident occurred, all Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, except for the Overseas Chinese Daily run by the traitor Cen Weixiu, have published relevant news in prominent positions, but no one has commented or criticized it. However, the "Bird's Eye View" column in the newspaper on the 27th said: "There is a coming and going in things. I think, if British military police established headquarters (the original text adds an "S" to indicate the plural - reporter's note) everywhere in China to arrest people, what kind of reaction would there be?" Only this newspaper could say such "humor"! According to the Kuomintang Daily on the 28th, "Although Yu Zhaoqi left the Peninsula Hotel yesterday to come to Hong Kong for an hour, he was still guarded by the British military. Since our side has a letter of guarantee from the British side to be responsible for guarding Mr. Yu, we have withdrawn our military police who were monitoring Mr. Yu."

As of the time this reporter is writing, the army authorities in Hong Kong have not issued any statement on this incident. How the situation will develop is difficult to determine for the moment. In short, our country's military law and sovereignty in Hong Kong have encountered another trial!

### The Answer to the Miraculous Toothache Remedy

(Editor's note) After Mr. Zhang from this newspaper’s frontline sought Ye Tianshi's miraculous toothache remedy in this column, we have successively received letters from Kunshan Nong'ao and reader Wang Suqin... and more than thirty people, who have copied out the original recipe. The medicinal ingredients are all seven in number, and the amounts are the same, all claiming it has miraculous effects. This shows that the recipe is widely circulated and of great value. Now, we invite Dr. Chen Cunren, a traditional Chinese medicine expert in this column, to add a brief commentary and publish it below.

Zhang Tianshi's Miraculous Toothache Remedy (Original Recipe)

Calcined Gypsum 7 parts, Rehmannia Root 2 qian, Schizonepeta 1 qian, Moutan Bark 1 qian

Licorice 7 parts, Green Orange Peel 6 parts, Siler 1 qian

Mild cases need one dose, severe cases will heal after two doses. Do not give Moutan Bark to pregnant women. (The additional flavor ingredient has been omitted)

(Dr. Chen Cunren's Commentary) Ye Tianshi was a native of Suzhou and a famous doctor of the Qing Dynasty. He lived to eighty years old and died. There are ten volumes of medical case studies, which were compiled by later generations. This recipe is not listed, but small booklets of verified remedies published at the end of the Qing Dynasty did list this recipe.

In general, the causes of toothache can be summarized into four categories: (1) Tooth decay pain; (2) Liver fire pain – that is, neuralgia; (3) Wind-fire pain – affected by external feelings; (4) Yin deficiency pain – that is, fatigue causing loose teeth and receding gums, or vitamin C deficiency. This recipe contains seven ingredients: calcined gypsum clears actual fire, Rehmannia root nourishes body fluids (i.e., increases vitamin C), Schizonepeta and Siler disperse wind and heat, Moutan bark clears blood heat, and green orange peel and licorice harmonize and detoxify. Its effect is roughly like this. The combination is appropriate, so it is quite effective. However, according to my observation, this recipe cannot treat all four types of toothache. Generally, this recipe is most effective for tooth decay pain, or even has no effect, so you must seek treatment from a dentist. It is also less effective for the second type, liver fire neuralgia, with only 4 out of 10 seeing results. It can indeed have miraculous effects on the third type, wind-fire toothache, with 9 out of 10 seeing results. It also has a considerable effect on the fourth type, yin deficiency pain, with 5 or 6 out of 10 seeing results. This recipe has been circulating for a long time, and it is no accident that it has become an effective remedy. However, it is not a universal cure for all toothaches, and this explanation has been provided above. (The original recipe also has additional external application methods, which use many drugs and have disadvantages, so they have been omitted.)

### Three Million Refugees from Northern Jiangsu Are Suffering After Losing Their Homes

Inspire the Human Spirit of Universal Love and Mutual Aid to Donate What You Can

To the editor: The refugees in northern Jiangsu have suffered the enemy's invasion in recent years, and their wounds have not yet healed. On the day of victory and restoration, disaster struck again. Those with homes and families lost their homes and suffered, while those who were settled in their land have left their homes and turned their backs on their hometowns. They lack food and clothing, wander along the road, sleep in the wind and lodge in translation bureaus, and are in a miserable state! According to the survey statistics of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, the number of people is over three million. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has counted over 1,020,000 refugees who lack food and clothing. Feeling compassion for these refugees who have suffered such hardship, we extend our deepest sympathy in the spirit of human universal love and mutual aid. We intend to provide assistance with a feeling of wanting to relieve hunger and drowning. We have gathered eminent figures from all walks of life and social celebrities to form this association, raise donations, and help these wandering refugees. We have begun working at Room 323 on the third floor of the East [Missing Characters] Association. Having long admired [Your Newspaper] for upholding public opinion and serving society, we dare to ask you to widely publicize this and compete to raise funds. We are enclosing five donation booklets and hope you will check them.

Spring and Autumn

### Under the Scorching Sun

— Zhang Baihuai

I can truly perceive the spirited demeanor they possess, so full of resilience. Just like myself and other young friends, we have trekked through arduous paths toward victory for year after year. When a chance encounter allows us to clasp hands tightly on the street, and we are rendered speechless, unable to express our inner feelings, do we simply smile or even silently walk away from each other?

Often, we resort to cold detachment to avoid contact. A friend, writing from the distant rear, expressed that he sees people's faces more clearly. Once, he saw a classmate at the cinema entrance. He clearly recognized him, but due to a prior unreturned letter and the classmate's haughty demeanor, he dared not even greet him....

And now, I have finally encountered these two friends for the first time since our separation. I am aware they are engaged in a perilous undertaking, while I am building castles in the air with my endless daydreams. Envying others and doubting myself, I have felt deeply ashamed and pained pondering over this disparity in the past.

"Ah, who would have thought we'd run into you here! We were just asking about you!" he said. Even in their tense and turbulent lives, they haven't forgotten me. I genuinely regret that I couldn't utter those words first. — Wishing to understand a friend's current situation, but unwilling to inquire about their address; knowing their current situation brings peace of mind, but knowing their address compels writing a letter; oh, writing a letter, what could I possibly tell them!

But no matter what, I welcome them and rejoice in our happy reunion.

The fierce sun beats down upon us. The joyous laughter of friendship is a magnificent parasol. In this valley surrounded by mountains, we feel like we are rowing a boat, with sweat droplets like scattered water splashes stirred by the oars.

A white butterfly accompanies us on our journey along the roadside, fluttering ahead again and again. This delicate, pitiful little creature, is it actually racing us?

They have endless stories to tell: summer nights in Jiangnan, scenes of wind and snow, a tapestry of terror and courage, a life-and-death struggle. In a deep, wide, and boiling river of blood, I see them swimming across.

If I were able to wield my pen freely, I would write many moving stories. But because I cannot, I prefer to tell you! My friend obviously overestimates my abilities.

But even if I cannot, I am eager to hear it. I have already wasted a considerable amount of paper and time, and I certainly cannot abandon my pen in self-despair.

"Tell me, I hope to write it down."

This makes them hesitate. Where to begin? To recount a fragment from so many tearful life experiences in a short amount of time is a difficult task.

However, after a moment of thought, the friend walking on the left says:

"At that time, we were surrounded by the enemy. Our demolition squad was ordered to stay behind enemy lines, always seeking opportunities to strike at the enemy.

"This was a captured town; its fall was silent and secretive. The Japanese flag cast a dismal shadow on the town walls, and a maintenance committee was announced immediately.

"Initially, the enemy attempted to use our original town chamber of commerce president to perform their farce, but after searching through the hills and bamboo forests, they had to abandon this foolish dream. Wang Yaming, a dog cultivated by the enemy and the special service captain of the puppet army, was thrust onto the dark stage as the protagonist of a grotesque drama.

"We knew the name Wang Yaming, and we understood everything about his past. Before he was captured by the enemy, he was once a resourceful and courageous demolition expert. Tall, intelligent, and capable, he later became addicted to opium at only twenty-five years old.

"He wasn't entirely without conscience; he released over a dozen of our personnel from his hands. He even openly said: 'It's easy to give the Japanese a blow, very easy!'

"That time, I personally spoke with Wang Yaming. We often had to take such risks to accomplish a task.

"Originally, we wanted him to come out of the city, but he insisted that we send someone in… When I met Wang Yaming… I naturally disguised myself as a merchant… I asked him to dismiss the guards and explained my purpose. Suddenly, I saw his expression change: 'You don't need to say more!' From his demeanor, I knew he was pretending. He certainly wouldn't immediately defect, but he wouldn't kill me either. I said with sarcasm: 'It's too late to regret it now!'

"He pondered silently for a moment, unexpectedly stood up, and led me to his room.

"'Well? Don't make me wait too long here,' I said.

"But he became very polite, offering the best cigarettes and candies, and said: 'We need to discuss a secret plan.'

"At this point, I felt reassured, feeling that my mission had a good chance of success. Although this simple ancient city had fallen silently, it was an important stronghold for the enemy. There were over a hundred enemies in the city, and five or six hundred new recruits being trained. If the plan succeeded, that is, if the enemy's warehouse was blown up, the combat gains would be considerable.

"This city was seventy or eighty li away from the railway line. Normally, the enemy's supplies were transported by train and then by truck to a small ferry fifteen li from the city, then transported to the city by coolies and horses by the enemy in the city. This route was heavily guarded almost once a week. The wooden boxes containing gunpowder were all yellow. We thought of using these yellow wooden boxes. If we could load a time bomb into one of these boxes, mix it into the enemy warehouse, then it would be successful.

"So I said to Wang Yaming, the opportunity must not be missed. The enemy's supplies would surely arrive within these two days. The enemy's troops were advancing rapidly, sweeping away our mountain guerrillas. After much consideration, Wang Yaming agreed and set a time to deliver the time bomb.

"Just as I was preparing to leave, a report came in that a Chinese soldier had entered the city. I was quite alarmed. The enemy's intelligence was so powerful. Later, Wang Yaming helped me find a solution. He dressed me in a puppet army uniform and escorted me out of the city gate.

"After I returned, I started working. We planned to bury landmines on the training ground at the same time as the enemy warehouse exploded, in order to kill the enemy's new recruits. On the other hand, we also contacted a small number of friendly forces to feign an attack at dawn when the bomb exploded. If Wang Yaming defected at that time, the plan would be completely successful.

"Wang Yaming is hateful! This fellow only verbally agreed to us. The landmines exploded, killing or injuring thirty enemy soldiers, but there was no sound from the warehouse. Alas, I thought, if he still felt proud after becoming a traitor, it was impossible for him to rebel against his master!"

At this point, my friend stopped. The sun was still scorching, causing sweat to fill our cheeks, making it difficult to open our eyes when we looked up. One really should wear a wide-brimmed straw hat when walking in the summer.

"Is this story over?" I felt dissatisfied.

"It's over," my friend said. "The traitor's ending is always the same. Not long after this incident, Wang Yaming was killed by us. Wang Yaming had a beautiful younger sister who had an affair with the Japanese pacification team leader. The pacification team leader was a muddle-headed debauchee, and his sister was a demonic seed. One night, this pair of darlings was captured alive by another group of our comrades… As for that sister, perhaps he should tell the story."

With an even more legendary story shortening the road, we saw the spire of the town ahead. The sunlight was fading, and there was a gentle breeze. I happily looked at my two friends, their wind-beaten faces now reddened by today's scorching sun.

### Ode to a Humble Birth

In a dilapidated village near the sea, a family of two who made a living by fishing, the husband suspended his fishing for a day because his wife gave birth to their first child today, relying on his strong body and a pair of black and thick hands toiling, replaced his wife to do the messy housework: washing rice, chopping wood, cooking, washing the child's diaper, and taking care of the wife's diet tea ...

The child maintained the tradition of his father, being both black and large, although the pair of hands were small, but also strong and round, often when he was born, he also cried a few original sounds, and the crying came especially loud, heavy, accompanied by the whistling of the waves, playing the overture of birth.

Three days after the child was born, without the deserved rest and recuperation, the wife climbed down from the bed, although she felt a little weak in spirit, the bottom of her face revealed a comforting expression, the husband's face also showed a proud smile from time to time, because their incense could be passed on, their simple and instinctive love became deeper.

The June sunshine painted a golden color on the sea, the splashing waves, impacting the rocky shore, the husband writing a bronze small boat on the sea cast his hope of the net, the wife was sitting under the eaves of the shade to mend the broken, sleeping peacefully, crimson cheeks, twitching lips, round face, reflecting the blue sea and blue sky and golden sunshine, constitute a beautiful and moving picture of life.

When the husband carried a bag of labor income - fresh and beating fish stepped on the way home, the wife saw clearly in the distant doorway, and was about to stand up, the child woke up and cried again, she had to pick him up, close to her own chest, and went forward to meet the tired husband. Although she could not help her husband, as usual, to carry the heavy linen bag decorated with fish on his back, however, when she approached her husband, the husband showed a smile on his sweaty face, and made a funny face to tease the ignorant child to laugh, put down the fish bag, enthusiastically picked him up from his wife's arms, high interest in the air, at this time, the sunshine was full of the child's face, the waves were being stirred by the strong wind, and a wave behind the head of the white flying flowers, fluttering past the front carbon A wave, set off the clear blue sky behind, symbolizing the beginning of a new life!

However, the storms of the world, after all, surpassed the waves of the sea, the devil's hand of sorrow often tormented the joy of life, their peaceful life was disturbed by ruthless unpredictable events; suddenly a gust of wind rolled up on the sea, storms agitated the waves, roaring and roaring, the rocky shore finally could not withstand the impact of the waves of ten thousand feet high and was destroyed, and the sea water then ran to the shore like a beast, their thatched cottage was washed away by the flood, the dilapidated fishing boat, fishing net and all the furniture were also silently buried in the water.

The husband carried two thin quilts of baggage, holding the sleeping hot child, the wife carried her personal clothing, and both began the exile journey, they fled to a strange village thousands of miles away, to rebuild a warm home!

They braved the wind and frost and the chaos of starvation, and finally arrived at a village more than fifty miles away from the sea, and turned to their only relative - the mother's home, her father had died in his early years, and now only a old mother was left, although there were still dozens of acres of fields, but because there were no children under her knees, she had to let it be barren in vain, so the young and strong couple inherited this piece of property, and from then on abandoned the fishing life and cultivated the desolate land for many years, and was able to be self-sufficient and live and work in peace and contentment. In their simple hearts, they would naturally find a truth, because they firmly believed that: there is always a way out.

The child grew up in a string of ignorant months, so much like his father, with the same robust voice and body, after his first birthday, his father named him "Haigen", indicating that this small life was born by the sea, while they still often yearned for the life by the sea so difficult, the sea waves also often tormented them, but finally could not obliterate their simple and solid love, and passed on from generation to generation, until forever and ever.

### Flying Together (72)

— Zhao Qingge

To understand what kind of mindset Mrs. Mo harbored, Lihua, this time summoning her courage, broke through her long-standing habit of silence and questioned Mrs. Mo.

"Mom, how much longer do I have to sing before I can stop?"

"Xiaohua, what do you mean by that?" Mrs. Mo was somewhat confused by Lihua's question, and she stared and said.

"I mean, when can I stop singing?" Lihua rephrased the question for clarification.

"Oh, my dear! There's still a long way to go!" Mrs. Mo said with a smile, pulling Lihua's hand. "You're only three years old and have just begun to show a bit of promise. You have to sing until you're as famous as Mei Lanfang, until your mother and I don't have to worry about clothing and food. Then you can stop singing."

Lihua pondered in her heart: "Sing until you're as famous as Mei Lanfang; 'Sing until you don't have to worry about clothing and food.'" Becoming as famous as Mei Lanfang, she felt was simply a dream. As far as she knew, even now, no one in the profession could even dare hope for such a thing. Those better than her, older than her, didn't even consider it. How could she dare? Even if she sang her whole life, she was afraid it would be impossible. As for singing until she didn't have to worry about clothing and food, that was easier! But what was worth considering was what Mrs. Mo meant by "not having to worry about clothing and food"? How much money would she need to have in hand to not have to worry about clothing and food? That depended on how high and how great Mrs. Mo's standards for "eating" and "clothing" were. She remembered that Mrs. Mo used to say: "Sing, sing until you're famous, and in the future, when you have money, you can eat well and dress well." She was almost completely lost about how "good" Mrs. Mo was describing! She thought to herself that even if she sang out a mountain of money, Mrs. Mo would still feel it wasn't enough. Moreover, singing out a "mountain of money" was easier said than done. Even if she sang for another ten or twenty years, she was afraid it wouldn't be enough. Thinking that neither of these two things was something she could easily accomplish, and that Mrs. Mo insisted that she accomplish them, she felt she was finished! She felt she had no hope of rescue, and so she dejectedly hung her head.

"Xiaohua, singing is good! Look at you now, so many people are supporting you! Giving you things, inviting you to eat. When you become even more famous, you'll be even more impressive! Sing well, singing is more useful and promising than anything else." Mrs. Mo coaxed Lihua in a didactic tone. "But, haven't you seen Uncle Shi? Uncle Shi became like that because of singing," Lihua suddenly raised her head and retorted in defiance.

"That's because he didn't sing well. People looked down on him, so he went crazy!" Mrs. Mo said dismissively.

"If I also don't sing well, I'll also go crazy! What will I do?"

"No, you absolutely won't, Xiaohua!" Mrs. Mo said with conviction. "You're still very young, and your future is bright! Stop thinking nonsense."

"No, I want to grow old, I want to fall down like Uncle Shi! So, I want to stop singing as soon as possible, to avoid being looked down upon in the future," Lihua said calmly.

—Beautiful Darkness—

When I was a child, I was very timid. One day, I told my mother again that I was afraid of the dark. She said, "Child, you don't understand the beauty of darkness."

That evening, I saw her turn off the lights and sit alone in the dark. She said, "If you want to come, come. I won't force you. However, if you sit still in the dark, and look clearly, you can see many things that you cannot see in the bright light of day." I sat down beside her, and she pointed out to me how everything in the room had changed, and many things that seemed mundane in the light now seemed new and interesting. The bed looked like nothing more than a place to rest, and the patterns on the bedsheets that could be seen during the day were now invisible. The various forms of the chairs could not be distinguished at this time. Everything in the room seemed especially quiet and intimate.

The next evening, my mother and I sat by the window in the dark, listening quietly to the hymns coming from the distant church, and watching the old trees in the courtyard bloom with white flowers, looking as pure and white as snow in the hazy starlight. From that day on, I often followed my mother every night, turning off the lights in the house and going to experience the quiet beauty of the darkness. Once, while sitting in the dark, my mother said, "Don't be afraid. Recognize what you're afraid of, and you won't be afraid anymore."

Years later, I had started my own family. Once, when I suffered a major financial setback, I sat down with my family to discuss how to deal with it. We turned off the lights again and sat in the dark. We often turned off the lights whenever we wanted to listen to music quietly, or discuss something attentively. But that time, sitting in the dark, I suddenly remembered my mother's words. We had all felt timid at first, but I immediately realized that we should deal with it calmly.

As a result, we overcame all the difficulties. At the same time, through the family's united efforts, we tasted many joys of life.

The lessons my mother taught me when I was a child because I was afraid of the dark, unexpectedly helped me overcome a dangerous crisis many years later. It not only added to my courage, but also instilled in me an attitude of "appreciating life", which helped me solve many problems in life.

### Stuttering and Left-Handedness

— Nai Fan

Stuttering seems to be a prevalent condition. Although it does not threaten people's health, it does cause inconvenience, especially in social situations. Stuttering is quite unsightly. People who stutter cannot become politicians, lawyers, or teachers. In short, a person who stutters will suffer greatly in many situations.

However, what causes stuttering? Are there any methods of treatment? These are questions that everyone is concerned about.

According to psychological research, stuttering is related to left-handedness.

What is left-handedness? It is necessary to explain that first. Normally, people mainly use their right hand for work. The right hand is stronger, and its use is also more flexible. Psychologists have discovered that this characteristic of using the right hand is not due to learning, but is a congenital endowment. Therefore, 97 or 98 percent of people are right-handed, but there are also 2 or 3 percent who are exceptions: they are left-handed.

Left-handedness is hereditary. Whether holding a pen, using chopsticks, bouncing a ball, ..., left-handed people find it more convenient to use their left hand. Although there are fewer left-handed people, they can often be found, just like stuttering.

However, because most people are right-handed, the characteristics of a left-handed child are often ignored by parents or teachers. When the child is learning to hold a pen, use chopsticks, ..., they think it is imitating incorrectly. Therefore, through correction or even punishment, the left-handed child is forced to work with the right hand. The child is ignorant and naturally has to follow along. However, this causes stuttering.

According to psychological research, the nerves for language and the nerves for the movement of the dominant hand are located adjacent to each other in the brain. Therefore, when a left-handed child is forced to use the right hand, the language nerves are disturbed because of their proximity. As a result, speech cannot be uttered smoothly, and stuttering develops.

Therefore, parents and teachers should pay special attention to children with a hereditary predisposition to left-handedness. There is no need to force them to use their right hand; otherwise, the child may develop stuttering as an adult.

### One Thing About Housework

— Translated by Bao Zhiying

When making bread, the dough easily sticks to the wooden board. To prevent this, you can first lay wax paper on the board.

Apply colorless nail polish to the crochet hook used for knitting wool to make it smooth, which makes it more convenient to use.

When cutting linoleum and a right angle shape is needed, first drill small holes in the corners to prevent tearing.

Knitters of wool yarn often have to wind it into a ball. If there is no one to assist, or there are no regular tools, you can use the drawer of a cabinet.

Hang many small clothespins on a coat hanger to make a convenient clothes drying rack.

### The Ideal Family of the Future

— Translated by Zuo Xi

On a corner of Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, there stands a novel and unique house, adorned with beautiful American cedar walls and a shimmering aluminum roof. Inside, the house has five rooms, and the interior design and furnishings are all original and ingenious. Los Angeles architect Penster deliberately built this house as a kind of experiment. Inside the house, there is an electronic dust absorber, an indoor transportation system, five remotely controlled speakers, more than ten electrical switches, a toilet with neon lights, a sterilizing electric light, a sound-absorbing ceiling, and an electric toothbrush. This electric toothbrush is made of rubber and operates by vibrating with electricity when brushing teeth, saving the trouble of brushing.

Since the house was opened to the public in March, visitors have flocked to it, marveling at this modern architecture. The architect's goal is to determine, from public criticism, which of the new family furnishings best suit the tastes of the general public.

This house is assumed to be for a family of four, a couple and two children. The entire house is U-shaped, surrounding the courtyard, with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one guest room, one living room, one dining room, one kitchen, one workshop, and one garage. All rooms are equipped with air conditioners, so it is warm in winter and cool in summer.

It cost Pence a full US$75,000 to build this house. Although it is because the interior furnishings are too luxurious, it ultimately fails to solve the basic problem of family architecture, that is, exquisite technology and low cost. However, once this problem is solved, won't we be able to enjoy this comfortable and luxurious charming residence?

Pence-style kitchens, whether large and highly mechanized family factories, are equipped with scientific lighting, artificial ventilation, and sound absorbers, as well as various procedures to simplify cooking and housework. All the machines weigh a total of 2,000 pounds. On one side of the wall is installed a four-burner gas stove, next to a bowl rack and cabinet for preparing food. In front of the large glass window, there is a garbage disposal mechanism and a hydraulic dishwasher, followed by a chest of four drawers, each storing different foods. Opposite the glass window is a fully equipped laundry area, with a washing machine, a dryer, and an iron. There is also a drying machine.

The center of the kitchen is the nerve center of the entire house, the core of an indoor transportation system. From here, you can talk to all the rooms. From here, you can remotely control the opening and closing of lights and radios, open and close doors, and turn on lawn sprinklers.

### American Women

— Wang

World War II is over. American women have worked hard for the country in the long past four years, their work is heavy, and they have had very few opportunities to rest. Now they can finally take a breath. The people in charge of factories and institutions have decided to give women quite a long vacation, allowing them to travel and rest in various places. Merchants are already busy preparing to make a good profit.

### Woman Pushing a Cart

— Xinzi

A tattered blue cloth shirt,

A pair of broken straw sandals,

Dragging a long, long

Shadow alone!

A heavy load of goods,

Thin but strong legs.

Facing forward—

Treading uphill.

Years pass in the rumble of wheels,

Deep wrinkles on the forehead are a record of history.

The broken cart is her old companion, the sum total of her possessions.

The wheel—moving like the earth,

Push, push, pushing uphill,

Loosening scattered and fragmented grains,

Sweeping away dust and dirt.

A patch of verdant color,

Rippling from the depths of the earth,

Like the sea under the sun,

Like the trees in the spring breeze.

### Torment (4)

— Hu Shanyuan

The Torment of Publishers

The publishers referred to here are certainly not those with connections and subsidies, but rather those who are independently capitalized and self-managed. The former publish their names and promote their reality; they cannot be included in the cultural world at all. They do not have the torment of ordinary publishers; their torment is failure outside of publishing. Only the latter are true publishers, and they are now in extreme torment.

First, let's talk about capital. Their capital belongs to shareholders, or their individual costs are so high that their business has no certainty of making money. No matter how good a manuscript is, no matter how much the editors they employ plead, they cannot but carefully consider the survival of their entire business and can only collect the most profitable manuscripts. They want to make legitimate promotions, but that would endanger the survival of their business. They will not do that! Their creed is: it is best not to accept manuscripts and use the funds for other profitable avenues; it is best not to pay for accepted manuscripts, because royalties are cheaper than labor; to typeset but not print, because the typeset words will not sell, unlike blank paper that can be readily converted into cash; to print but not sell, because the market is rising every day, and selling is not enough to cover costs, so it is better to wait for the price to rise sufficiently, or for the market to stabilize, before selling, so that the money earned is more practical. They are willing to use the capital they can use to do some cultural undertakings in addition to making money, but the environment does not allow it, so they have no choice but to listen helplessly.

Next, let's talk about connections. They have no connections. They do a poor job, and they are already tormented; they do a good job, and they still cannot avoid torment. Why? Often, some people want to give them connections, want to take advantage of their lack of connections.

Naturally, they also want to find a way out. They want to change careers, but like the editors, they are used to this line of work and cannot change. If it is a larger bookstore, with a large scale and many employees, even closing the store is not easy. The publisher who is in charge is truly tormented to the extreme!

Who should they blame, what should they blame? They can only blame the environment!

### A Foolish Thing

— Shao Fu

Walking out of the house, a red fire hydrant on the side of the road was constantly flowing water, as big as a bowl. People like rickshaw drivers and laborers were using this free tap water to wash their hands and feet and other things. I stopped and saw that the hydrant cap was probably stolen, so the water flowed freely onto the road.

It's such a waste for it to flow like this day and night. I should report it to the water company, I thought.

The sun was very harsh, and I also had something urgent to do, but I still ran to a public telephone booth, spent three hundred yuan on a phone call, and reported the incident to the Shanghai Water Company. The conversation on the phone was as follows:

[Me] Hello! Is this the water company?

[Company] Hmm! What's the matter?

[Me] A tap on Huangdu Road is broken, and water is constantly flowing out. Please send someone to repair it quickly.

[Company] Which tap?

[Me] It's the red tap next to the road.

[Company] Where is it?

[Me] At the end of North Sichuan Road, Huangdu Road, formerly called Huanglu Road.

[Company] Where are you calling from, the police station?

[Me] No, I live nearby.

[Company] Oh! Got it.

Two days later, until I wrote this article now, the tap still has no cap, and it has been flowing water for two days and nights for nothing, and it is still flowing.

The Shanghai Water Company probably doesn't care about this little leak, I thought, blowing a pool of spring water, did I make a fool of myself!

### A Fierce Tiger!

— Zhang Minfu

The setting sun slanted down, and in the shadows under the eaves of the thatched hut, many bare-backed, barefoot farmers were sheltering.

"Alas! What kind of year is this! No harvest year after year, and now some plague has broken out." Old Man Liu took his pipe away from his mouth and said gloomily.

"It's true! It's been a real mess these past few days! A dozen or so strong young men died in a row; now it's even worse. That bitch Deyun was just carried out yesterday, and Deyun's brother and his mother are making a big fuss again—hum, scary!..." Zhao Lao Er, who had a shaved head, shook his head sadly. When he said the last sentence, he seemed to be afraid of something and swallowed the last half of the sentence back.

Old Man Liu looked up at the sky, as if thinking gloomily. Fear was evident on the faces of everyone sitting there.

After a long silence, a bare-backed young man suddenly broke it; he said in surprise: "It's really strange; everyone says that if everyone pretends to be celebrating the New Year, they can get through this unfortunate year, and the plague god will withdraw his magic power and return to heaven. But recently, many people have come, some pasting up hanging flags, some pasting up door couplets; why hasn't it had any effect?"

"Alas! It's useless." Old Man Liu sighed as he spoke. "In the past, Mr. Shen's acupuncture skills were like magic. Whenever someone got this disease, bringing him over for a needle would be enough. Also, Master Hu's holy water was like a panacea; patients who drank it would see immediate results. Now it's very different: Old Man Nian, Deyun..., they've had acupuncture, they've drunk holy water, and I heard they even made a vow at the temple; but none of it has worked!"

"Is there no savior at all, and do you just die if you get sick?" several people asked disappointedly.

"There is a savior." Old Man Liu lit his pipe and continued, "Didn't Mr. Li Si, who came from the city, say that in this day and age, you have to see a foreign doctor to treat this disease. They say the disease is called 'Cholera,' and getting a foreign injection and taking foreign medicine will cure it."

"Then why not invite a foreign doctor to treat it? It's so scary to see one die after another!"

"Bah!..." The old man curled his lips, with a contemptuous look. "Foreign doctors? That's only for the rich old masters! It costs tens of thousands of coins to treat it once; can we Zhuangmu heads afford it? I'm afraid selling the ancestral grave wouldn't be enough to treat it twice, would it?"

Everyone stared at each other, and the bare-backed young man couldn't help sticking out his tongue.

They knew there was no other way, so they had to comfort themselves by saying: "Calamity is predestined, and it's hard to escape fate; it's no use being afraid of death, so let's leave it to fate!"

"Alas,..."

Suddenly, a cry-like voice came from afar: "Grandpa Qiao'er!..." Everyone's eyes almost all fell on the face of an old woman who was getting closer and closer; especially Old Man Liu, who was smoking, widened his eyes even more; because he already knew that the person who came in a panic was his wife.

"What is it, what is it?" he asked in panic.

"It's terrible!... Qiao'er's... grandpa... is also... vomiting... diarrhea..." She choked up when she said the last sentence.

Old Man Liu's lips immediately turned pale, and the wrinkled skin on his face was also twitching; the pipe in his mouth fell to the ground unconsciously. From his panting, it seemed as if he was calling out painfully: "Terrible 'Cholera'!" Immediately, his body collapsed as if paralyzed.

Young farmers helped the trembling Old Man Liu behind them, followed by the sobbing old woman.

In the shadows under the eaves of the thatched hut, everything was very quiet, except for the buzzing of flies on a few melon tendrils.

The next morning, a bunch of paper money was inserted high on the door of Old Man Liu's house; the wind blowing through, making a rustling sound. Several old women stood in front of the door, some lifting their clothes to wipe away tears, while a burst of mournful women's cries came from inside; "Liu—you left our children and adults!..." Although it was a hoarse voice, her painful cries did not diminish because of it.

In the past few days, the atmosphere in the village has become even more tense. Children wearing white mourning clothes ran around in the streets, and bursts of crying could be heard everywhere.

Recently, according to the highest administrative meeting in the village, it was decided to recite a Taoist scripture in the next few days. Sprinkle holy water on the streets at night, which can allegedly annihilate the plague-spreading ghosts and gods.

### Summer Scenery in Chang'an

— Dong Yang

Xi'an has become more and more lively recently. Every day, countless travelers pass through here, and many guests stay for a short time; those who want to return to Beiping mostly take the Shaanxi Provincial Railway Bureau's bus to Hancheng from here, go to Shanxi, pass through the Zhengtai Railway and return to Beiping, or still take the train east to Shanghai and return to Beiping by sea.

The climate in Xi'an has been very hot recently. This is very different from previous years, and its heat is almost the same as that of Shanghai and Hankou at this time. Ice cream has long been on the market for five hundred yuan a cup, and more people come out to stroll on the streets every afternoon. It is really lively in the popular urban areas of Dong Dajie and Nan Yuanmen. Cheongsam with floral prints seem to have become the most popular fashion for women, and women in the countryside are also vying to wear them, regardless of whether they fit or not. There are three movie theaters in total, with four shows a day, and almost every show is full, but there are also many viewers who don't buy tickets. Therefore, the owners of the movie theaters have been constantly complaining recently.

There are also more cars on the road. Jeeps and American four-wheeled trucks are often speeding; but they drive too fast, and accidents often happen. There are also public buses running from Dongmen to Ximen recently, with a full fare of two hundred yuan, which is considered cheap. If you get off at the bell tower, it is only one hundred yuan. However, only four cars are running, and they often break down, and each time the cars are overcrowded. Recently, someone has proposed repairing and paving asphalt roads, but no concrete measures have been seen.

The reconstruction brought a university—National Northwest University, an independent college, and National Northwest Institute of Technology to Xi'an. Most of the faculty and students of these two schools have recently come to Xi'an from Chenggu. The school's instruments and books are also being moved by hand. The site of Northwest University is the former site of Northeast University outside Ximen, and the president is Mr. Liu Jihong. The site of Northwest Institute of Technology is within the old No. 1 Middle School in Zao Ci Lane, and the president is Mr. Pan Chengxiao. However, the site of the institute is not enough. Recently, the Assets Committee has allocated the site of the Xianyang Alcohol Factory, which has been closed, to the institute for temporary use. The institute will go to take over soon, and it will still be divided into two campuses in the future. The first campus is in Xi'an, and the second campus is in Xianyang.

The cost of living in Xi'an is also very high. Flour has been sold for more than 11,000 yuan a bag, rice for 4,500 yuan a dou, eggs for 100 yuan for two, and haircuts with oil and electric blow-drying for 1,400 yuan per person. Although the salaries of public educators have been adjusted in June, the increase in the Northwest region is very small. Public educators are complaining endlessly. Recently, the judicial sector (Shaanxi Higher Court, Chang'an District Court) and the education sector (Northwest University, Northwest Institute of Technology, and Northwest Medical College, which is about to move to Xi'an) have also successively telegraphed the Executive Yuan to make reasonable adjustments to the salaries of public educators.

### Ideological Test of German Teenagers

— Translated by Deng Xi

In an infant prisoner-of-war camp in Concarneau, France, more than 7,000 German teenage prisoners, aged 12 to 17, are being influenced by democratic ideas under the guidance and management of French military officers. This year in April, two informal democratic ideology tests were successively held in the camp, with a total of more than 200 questions.

One of the questions was: "Is Hitler a mad criminal?" The results showed that 2,960 people answered yes, 2,951 answered no, and the remaining 981 were hesitant.

Another question was: "Should Nazi soldiers be held responsible for Germany's failure?" The results showed that 2,575 people answered "yes," 2,300 people answered "no," and for the question "If the Nazi leaders captured by the United Nations now were ordered to be hanged one by one, would that be okay?" Of the 7,000 people, 3,170 said "yes," and 2,923 said no.

And did they think it was right and sinful that their country was defeated this time? To this question, 4,347 people said it was right. And their failure this time was the most sinful. Regarding their views on mixed-race children, "I will never marry a Jewish woman because she will lower the value of me and my descendants," only 514 people thought it was right, while 6,056 people thought it was nonsense.

This series of questions and answers is worth studying. The anti-Jewish movement was originally used by the Nazis as a guise to promote the war, but the youth of the country were not deeply poisoned by it. As for whether they deliberately planned well when answering the test, that is unknown.

### Small Matter

— Xiao Min Shen Jian

Dear Editor:

After reading the first article of your newspaper's "Free Talk", "Small Matter," I couldn't help but think of a matter that was even smaller than a small matter, perhaps because its impression was indeed a bit too much for people! Today, I specifically venture to ask the relevant authorities about it; - it seems that it is already midsummer according to the current climate and season, but the trees planted on both sides of Zhongzheng East Road from the Bund to the Great World are still living in the severe winter under this hot climate, still wearing the winter coat - rice straw, I really don't understand what the intention is! I respectfully ask for your well-being, Xiao Min Shen Jian

### Secrets of the Brain

— Dongfang Jing

The Pituitary Gland of Geniuses is Particularly Developed

What are the characteristics of the brains of geniuses? This is a mystery that scientists have been constantly exploring. The secret of the genius brain lies not in the size of the brain itself, but in the size of the blood vessels that nourish the brain.

There are arteries and veins in the meninges, and their size and structure are absolutely related to the strength of brainpower; as for the size, weight, and structure of the brain itself, it is irrelevant.

As early as 1926, Dr. Hai Zhi began to systematically study the brain vessels and meninges of geniuses and ordinary people. He found that the brain blood vessels of geniuses are particularly rich and complex.

The structure, size, and weight of the genius brain are not much different from those of ordinary people. The real difference is the excellent meninges, with many blood vessels; the brain of ordinary people has small and constricted blood vessels.

The brain is not an "isolated faction," it is inevitably stimulated by other organs. The brain has a close relationship with the glands of the human body.

Patients with schizophrenia are a good example, caused by the disharmony of the pituitary gland and adrenal glands. The substance secreted by the adrenal glands is like the gas that ignites the flames of human thought; without it, no light can be produced.

Disorders of the thyroid gland directly affect the brain. Slow thinking is closely related to the sluggishness of the gonads and thyroid gland.

The pituitary gland of geniuses is particularly developed, and the activity of the gonads and thyroid gland reach their peak.

The adrenal glands and pituitary gland are also closely related. If the adrenal glands are healthy, the pituitary gland must also be healthy, and the brain is also healthy. If a gland has a declining phenomenon, the brain's movement and activity will immediately become ineffective.

The secret of the genius brain has only now been correctly revealed. All past theories were not correct.

### Hesitation

— Yi Gu

I have an uncle who, due to business relations, became acquainted with the manager of a Huorong Match Factory. This match factory was the owner of the goods on the truck that crashed in Zhenru. That manager was also the cargo escort on the truck. During the crash, he was thrown several *wen* away; therefore, although he was injured, he was fortunate enough to escape the disaster, while those in the truck were burned to death because they could not escape.

After the accident, according to his account of the situation at the time: "This happened in the early morning, when the earth barely revealed a glimmer of dawn. However, the cause of the crash was not necessarily due to poor visibility. The biggest reason was probably the truck driver's hesitation and inability to make a decisive decision. Because, although the sky was dim, a long train coming from afar was at least vaguely discernible in shape and sound. If he had immediately stopped the truck and waited for the express train to pass, then this tragedy would not have happened at all. Even if he had accelerated and taken a risk, there was a chance that he could have crossed the tracks. The problem was that he wanted to go across but didn't dare to, and if he didn't go across, he would immediately brake. He missed the most precious moment, and when he wanted to rush across again, the collision occurred because the train had arrived."

Looking at the above facts, we can see that no matter what we do, we often fail due to a lack of courage and perseverance, resulting in missed opportunities. And worldly education tells us that the most important secret to success is to make decisive decisions, because hesitation is the greatest enemy of success.

The principle of how great people deal with things is to first calmly observe and consider the pros and cons of the matter, and then make a decision. Once a decision is made, there is absolutely no room for turning back. Even if one unfortunately fails, one will never be discouraged or regret the inappropriate decision. One can only immediately find another way to remedy the situation. When facing a crisis of success or failure, there is no extra time for thinking, and one should quickly and with a firm attitude immediately decide what to do.

People who yearn for success, stop hesitating! Making decisive decisions is your only good medicine!

### Children of the Times

— Wu Daquan

Children of the times,

Standing at the cutting edge of the era,

Modern,

Loving beauty,

Without souls,

Their souls have long been taken away by pigs,

They are like a straw,

Unable to withstand the blowing of the celestial wind,

Simply,

Completely doomed.

Sunglasses paint everything with a layer of color,

White-skinned, silk-stockinged young ladies only know how to show off on waxed floors,

Bright clothes are free from any working dust,

Strange handbags flaunt past.

Go away,

Such children!

China is waiting for you to build a strong country,

I'm afraid it's like a blind man waiting for dawn,

It's just a spring dream.

### Flying is Not Dangerous

Do you see this plane crashing into the corner of the house? This plane encountered bad air currents, glided down, and the pilot, Mr. Jia Shide, is very safe. The incident occurred in the central United States.

### Death of a Traitor – Obligatory Obituary in Newspapers

— Wuling Ren

Thousands of German people, under the order of the Allied Nations, held an anti-British demonstration in the city center square, singing the national anthem "Germany Above All Else." In our country, there are still middle school students reading "National Standard Textbooks" from the puppet government. Comparing the people of the defeated and victorious countries is frightening!

If Chen Gongbo, Miao Bin, and many other major traitors had died during the occupied period, their obituaries would have been published in all the newspapers. Now, after being executed, it didn't cost a penny, and the whole world knows, and all the newspapers in the country inadvertently provided them with an obligatory obituary advertisement each.

Mr. Pi asks him, "Do you want a tight one?" Does Miss Pi want it or not? I believe he will definitely shake his head to express his opposition. Wu's friends are often tireless and unaware of their stink, but they are unwilling to live with people with bad breath, avoiding them as if they were afraid of catching the plague. These are all very common things, and they are also the most unforgivable. Why?

Foreign goods are flooding in, but exports are scarce. Can this phenomenon be ignored? Indeed, the imbalance of import and export has some similarities with abnormal eating habits. Eating too much is harmful to the stomach and intestines, and adding to the fact that bowel movements are blocked is of course dangerous. At the same time, diarrhea without end and no nourishment is also unreasonable. How to restore health depends on the doctor's methods.
