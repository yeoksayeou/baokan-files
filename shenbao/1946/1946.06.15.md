### Northeast Armistice Negotiations Reach Agreement: Dispatching a Team to Mediate, Measures for Restoring Transportation Being Drafted

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The 14th marks the eighth day of the effective armistice period. The armistice deadline was originally seven days. The following is a summarized report on the progress of the negotiations over the past eight days: (1) Regarding the armistice negotiations on the Northeast issue, after General Beall arrived in Nanjing to report on the actual situation of the Northeast conflict and met with Zhou Enlai twice, he was then invited by Ambassador Stuart to bring both sides together. He clearly expressed his views on the Northeast and suggested that an executive team be dispatched as soon as possible to the Northeast conflict zone to implement the armistice order, so as to prevent the war from escalating and affecting the negotiations. After several discussions, until 10:00 am on the 14th, Zhou Enlai revisited Special Envoy Marshall to conduct decisive discussions on the first item of Chairman Chiang's armistice order regarding the Northeast armistice. As a result, it is reported that an agreement has been reached to immediately dispatch an executive team to mediate based on the three points of the Northeast agreement of March 27th. According to tonight's news, this agreement does not include any attachments, so that the executive team can effectively carry out its mediation mission. (2) Regarding the negotiations on road repair and bunker removal for the restoration of transportation, Special Envoy Marshall held separate discussions with Yu Dawei and Zhou Enlai no less than eight or nine times. The three-party talks between Marshall, Yu, and Zhou also took place five times. When Colonel Hill, Chief of the Transportation Management Section of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, was summoned to Nanjing to report to Special Envoy Marshall on the past work experience of the transportation team and the information collected by the Executive Headquarters on the major trunk lines of the Chinese railways (including the CCP-occupied areas), and after participating in more than two transportation negotiations, this issue reached a preliminary agreement after mutual concessions between the two sides, but the content has not been announced. According to well-informed sources, although the CCP is not as insistent as in the past on removing bunkers and managing工事 in sections, it still adopts a partial reservation attitude. Minister Yu is currently rushing to draft measures for instructions, so this matter can only be said to have made progress, but the issue itself has not yet been resolved.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] Qualified observers in Nanjing said that General Beall will return to Shenyang on the 15th and may bring back an armistice plan for the Northeast. Colonel Hill is now in Nanjing awaiting a plan to restore transportation to take back to Beiping. As for the need to grant Special Envoy Marshall the final arbitration power, judging from the results of recent negotiations, although it is not enough to indicate that the CCP has tacitly agreed to this, it is highly likely that the CCP will reconsider this matter. This is because the armistice deadline is approaching, and the CCP itself claims that it does not intend to delay. In summary, although the negotiations over the past eight days have not been without success, the situation in Shandong is serious. It is hoped that the CCP will refrain from further errors, and that mutual trust and concessions will lead to hope for a peaceful future.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] Beall changed his return to Ping to the 15th, then transited through Shenyang to Changchun.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The Nanjing Three-Person Conference sent a telegram to the Executive Headquarters stating that a considerable agreement has been reached on the restoration of transportation, pending only signing. The Transportation Department of the Executive Headquarters has become even busier because of this good news.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The Nanjing negotiations on the restoration of transportation have reached the stage of determining specific measures and deadlines. Huang Chenfeng, Chief of the CCP Section of the Transportation Department of the Military Mediation Headquarters, was summoned by Zhou Enlai and originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 14th, but due to bad weather, his departure was changed to the 15th. Huang is carrying various materials for the restoration of transportation. Accompanying Huang is Wu Yunfu. Wu's trip is to liaise with the UNRRA on relief issues in the CCP-controlled areas.

### Chen Yi Requests Dispatch of Team to Linyi: Shandong Situation May Ease, Marshall and Zhou Negotiating on Qingdao Issue

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The current military conflict in North China may not necessarily deepen into a full-scale civil war. Today, CCP Chief of Staff Luo Ruiqing told reporters that Chen Yi telegraphed the Executive Headquarters today, requesting that the Jinan and Xuzhou teams and senior personnel from the Executive Headquarters be dispatched to Linyi to jointly discuss ways to stop the conflict. If so, there is still room for discussion regarding the military conflict in Shandong Province. Luo admitted that there are multiple conflicts in Shandong, but explained that this is retaliation by the New Fourth Army. Luo advocated that the Executive Headquarters should dispatch additional executive teams to work in Central China, because most of the current teams are in the North China area, leaving a large void in Central China, which is prone to conflict. Regarding the Yan'cheng team, where government representative Lei Fenqiang was killed, Luo said that the situation is currently under investigation. If the responsibility lies with the CCP, the perpetrators will be punished. It is reported that Luo recently went to Zhangjiakou before returning to Ping. It is understood that Luo's trip to Zhang was to conclude his original duties in Zhang and to handle personal affairs. In addition, he also discussed with the CCP Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government how to continue transporting grain to the government to repay the loans the government made to the Hubei-Guangdong CCP army.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] According to a certain authoritative source, although the CCP claims that it has no intention of attacking Qingdao and Jinan, both places are still under siege as of today. Based on the current situation, unless the CCP voluntarily withdraws from Laifa, Dezhou, Taian, and Zaozhuang, and abandons its attempts to attack Liuhe and threaten the capital area, the overall situation is unlikely to be optimistic. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall personally asked Zhou Enlai why Dezhou and Taian were occupied after the joint armistice statement was issued, but Zhou did not give a clear answer.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The new government representative of the Jinan team, Major General Dong Zongshan, flew to Jinan on the 14th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] The CCP representative sent to Qingdao to stop the conflict was originally scheduled to fly back to the capital today to report, but due to weather conditions, he was unable to make the trip, delaying the resolution of the Qingdao crisis. CCP spokesperson Wang Bingnan frankly stated: "The CCP has no intention of occupying Qingdao. I believe that once our party representative returns here, a solution can be established. That representative will probably be able to return here tomorrow." Wang also said: "The solution to the Qingdao issue is currently being negotiated by Zhou Enlai and Marshall."

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 14th] Amidst the sound of the CCP army besieging Qingdao, Major General Clement, Commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, specially dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Nelson, Chief of the Intelligence Department, to fly to Linyi from Qingdao on a US Marine Corps plane at 7:00 am on the 13th, accompanied by CCP representative Hao Ding. Nelson and his party arrived in Linyi at 8:30 am and were warmly welcomed by the CCP, and met with Chen Yi, Commander of the CCP New Fourth Army. Nelson and Hao Ding flew back to Qingdao on the same plane at 7:00 pm that night. According to Chen Yi's statement to Nelson, he expressed his willingness to stop military action, but in fact, the CCP army did not stop attacking on the evening of the 13th.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 14th] Lieutenant Colonel Nelson, Chief of the Intelligence Department of the US Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, carried a private letter from Chen Yi, Commander of the CCP New Fourth Army, to Major General Clement during his trip to Linyi. Clement then held a meeting with Commander Ding Zhipan of the Garrison Command on the 14th and expressed optimism about the future of the Shandong situation.

[Another dispatch] Qingdao Mayor Li Xianliang flew back to Qingdao from Nanjing at noon on the 14th and visited Commander Ding Zhipan of the Qingdao Garrison Command and Major General Clement, Commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, for a long time in the afternoon.

### Encroaching on Foreign Strongholds, Intensifying Blockade of Jinan

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 14th] The CCP army is now intensifying its encirclement of Jinan. Its capture of Taian, Dezhou, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, and other places is clearly to drive out the outer forces of the National Army, preventing them from developing outward. The blockade of materials has been intensified in recent days. The CCP army outside Jinan has gathered more than 50,000, and is still increasing. In Jinan, there are more than 20,000 between Mingshui, Puji, and Longshan, and more than 10,000 in Zaoyuansi. Wandeyi is the main force of the CCP's First Division, and there are more than 3,000 near Qihe. On the 13th, 3,000 CCP troops fiercely attacked Yan'cheng, and the situation in Jinan is extremely tense. The Provincial Assembly and various mass organizations have telegraphed the central government to call for reinforcements to be sent north. Public morale is stable, and it is believed that the central government definitely has a solution to the Shandong situation, but it is hoped that it will not be tolerated any further. Jinan City is under curfew at 10:00 pm.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] Military news, after the CCP army launched a full-scale offensive in Shandong, its main force is approaching 15 kilometers south of Jinan.

### Cooke Convenes Meeting, US Planes Flying to Qingdao as Usual

[Our report] Rumors are spreading that the CCP army is attempting to attack Qingdao by land and sea. The stance and attitude of the US Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao is noteworthy. Admiral Cooke, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, returned to Shanghai from Qingdao the night before last. He held a meeting with senior naval officers yesterday morning, but according to naval public relations officials, the meeting convened by Admiral Cooke was only one of the daily routine meetings and there were no important resolutions. At the same time, Cooke expressed optimism about the situation in Qingdao during this return to Shanghai, and there is no change in the mission of the Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao. The US Marine Corps is in Qingdao to protect American property in Qingdao and will continue to maintain this work. The CCP army has not infringed on the US military, and the US military will not interfere in their affairs. The spokesperson believes that the reports in the newspapers seem to be an exaggeration.

[United Press, Beiping, 14th] Today, the US Marine Corps in Beiping claimed: The CCP army is approaching the Qingdao airfield. This US source claims that a bridge near the airfield has been destroyed by the CCP army, but the Marine Corps' scheduled flights are still flying from Beiping to Qingdao and Shanghai today.

According to Zhou, the Nationalists and the Communists have reached some agreement on the armistice and the restoration of transportation, but the issue of military reorganization has not yet been discussed. As for why military conflicts occurred after the issuance of the armistice order on the 15th, it was actually due to the different dates on which the two sides announced the armistice taking effect, resulting in misunderstandings. Zhou also stated that the CCP army will never attack Jinan or Qingdao. The representatives then expressed their opinions, expressing optimism about the future of peaceful negotiations. Finally, an invitation was issued to representatives of the three parties to the CPPCC for lunch at the Capital International Friendship Society on the 16th for a conversation.

### Executive Headquarters Discusses Military Reorganization, CCP's Troop Roster Still Not Submitted

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 13th] The Executive Headquarters' Military Reorganization Department held its second military reorganization meeting on the 10th. Those present were government representative Zeng Guanghan, CCP representative Chen Shiqu, and US representative Middleton (Davis representing). The following important matters were discussed: (1) The government representative urged the CCP to comply with the military reorganization agreement and submit the roster of troops to be retained. CCP representative Chen Shiqu agreed to telegraph Yan'an for instructions. (2) Regarding the dispatch of a supervisory reorganization team, the CCP insisted that the team could be composed of two parties, that is, the team supervising the reorganization of the CCP army could be composed of the CCP and the US. The government representative insisted that the reorganization team must be composed of the government, the CCP, and the US because there was no reason not to. A. The consistent organization of the Executive Headquarters is the participation of three parties. B. The Military Three-Person Group's directive on March 16th "utilizes the Joint Executive Team". C. It is easier to ensure that the task is carried out by the participation of three parties. This issue was not resolved. (3) The CCP representative proposed that the disbandment of puppet troops and the cancellation of senior command headquarters above the military level be included in the agenda. The government representative said that the two issues had been clearly stated in the military reorganization plan and did not need to be discussed, so it was dropped. This meeting originally intended to discuss (1) the demobilization regulations, (2) the reorganization, unified compilation, and demobilization regulations, (3) the establishment of supply areas, (4) the establishment of retained troops, and (5) the issue of supply area teams and reorganization teams and establishment. Because no concrete results were obtained, it was decided to hold another meeting on the 17th of this month to discuss.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 13th] According to a certain source, if the peace talks are successful, the CCP intends to appoint Nie Rongzhen, He Long, Lin Biao, Liu Bocheng, Xu Xiangqian, and Chen Yi as the commanders of the six reorganized armies.

### US to Help Train Our Army

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The US is preparing to help China train its army and is now awaiting Congressional approval. The number of people trained may be one million, with both government and CCP troops, in a ratio of five to one. Special Envoy Marshall has approved the plan drafted by the State Department in conjunction with the Army and Navy Departments, which is scheduled to train 60 divisions to form a small but highly combat-effective Chinese army. Well-informed sources said: The plan has three objectives: (1) to assist China in maintaining domestic security, (2) to assist in maintaining peace in Asia, and (3) to engage in necessary cooperation with the United Nations peacekeeping forces yet to be formed. Officials here now expect that even if Marshall's mediation fails, the training plan will still be implemented. Generally, it is believed that if mediation fails, the United States will have no other way but to fully assist the National Government in building a strong China. Well-informed official sources here said that Marshall has stationed US military officers in both the Nationalist and Communist armies. A few weeks ago, he appointed 87 US advisers to go to the CCP headquarters to assist the CCP in training its troops so that they could be incorporated into the American-trained regular army in the future.

### Cardinal Tien's Full Broadcast Speech

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 14th] Cardinal Tien Gengxin arrived in Qingdao by plane at 1:00 PM on the 14th. Many Catholics welcomed him at the airport. The mayor of Qingdao, Li Xianliang, accompanied him from Nanjing. Tien was originally the bishop of Qingdao, so this trip back to Qingdao will be brief, and he will soon fly to Beiping to assume his concurrent post as Archbishop of Beiping.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Cardinal Tien Gengxin broadcasted to Catholics nationwide today. The original text is as follows:

My dearest fellow Catholics across the country: By the wise arrangement of God, and through the selection of the Pope, I am able today to address you in the name of the first Chinese Cardinal, and I am extremely pleased. This joy is given to us all by God, something we have been constantly longing for since at least the Yuan Dynasty. Although I personally feel unworthy of the position of Cardinal, in order to realize the hopes of you all, and to make each of you happy, I have obeyed the Pope's command, forgetting my inadequacies, and accepted the appointment of Cardinal. I will rely on the grace of God to contribute all my energy to the Church throughout the country.

Today, we should thank the countless efforts of various religious orders and non-ordained missionaries, both Chinese and foreign, over the centuries. Their blood and sweat have irrigated this vineyard of God. May God reward their merits. We should also especially thank the current Pope Pius XII, who has appointed the first Cardinal in the Far East, established our Catholic Church system in China, designated the twenty ecclesiastical provinces of China, elevated twenty Chief Archbishops of the ecclesiastical provinces, and changed the Apostolic Vicariates across the country into formal dioceses. All of this is unprecedented, epoch-making, and an era-defining event in the history of the Church in China. It is also a very loving expression of the Pope towards our Church in China. How should we not be grateful? We should pray for the Pope, asking God to grant him all graces. The first Papal Representative to China, Archbishop Celso Costantini, and the current Papal Representative to China, Archbishop Antonio Riberi, have, through more than twenty years of effort, enabled the Church in China to receive such special favors and honors today. We have long known that they love China and love the Church in China, but today, with the manifestation of these facts, we have an even deeper understanding. We cannot forget Archbishops Costantini and Riberi and will always keep their deepest impression in our hearts. We should pray for them often.

I am not being polite or modest, I truly know that according to my personal knowledge and ability, I am definitely not worthy to be a Cardinal. However, given the vast territory and large population of China, and that it has always been a country that values ​​rites and culture, and now that the War of Resistance has been won and its international status has also improved, China is now in an important position in the world. To seek the happiness of all mankind in the world, or world peace, China is an indispensable factor. The Pope's emphasis on China, as well as the promotion of a Chinese Cardinal, is also a major reason. However, China's importance today was earned by all the people of the country and our leader Chairman Chiang through eight years of arduous War of Resistance. Therefore, we should wholeheartedly support the Central Government, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, work together with compatriots across the country to create a new China. This is also what the Pope has talked to me about many times and instructed me to convey to Catholics and non-Catholics across the country. Currently, we have not yet achieved full peace in our country, and the government is making a final effort. I hope that all Catholics across the country will especially pray for peace on the Solemnity of the Holy Trinity on the 16th of this month.

There are too many things we need to do in the future to say them all at once, but I can say one thing to you, we are now approaching a new stage, and before us is a new situation. We must have new efforts to adapt to new needs. In other words, we must have new reforms. We can no longer be complacent and stagnate in our original state. We must move forward, taking big strides forward. All old ways of evangelization, whether in the education of priests, in the methods of running primary and secondary schools, in the planning of evangelization funds, or in the promotion of various charitable undertakings, if there are unreasonable aspects, or if they are too conservative and do not meet the needs of the times, should be abandoned without hesitation, and new methods should be sought. Of course, when reforming, we should be very cautious, obey the commands of the local bishop, and not act rashly.

Dear Catholics everywhere, today the Holy See has completely entrusted the Church in China to us Chinese. This is the greatest honor, but it is also the greatest responsibility. We must unite in order to fulfill our responsibilities well, otherwise our strength will be dispersed and reduced, which is very dangerous. We must follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, love each other, and in administration, although we have divided the ecclesiastical provinces for the convenience of management, that is, the Archdiocese and the Diocese, in our work, we must never have the territorial concept of the diocese. We must do things practically and strive to avoid seeking personal glory. We should give glory to God in all things, because everything we do is done through Him, for Him, and with Him. Dear fellow Catholics across the country, our responsibilities have now increased. All our staff working within the Church system, from the Chief Archbishops of each ecclesiastical province, the Bishops of each diocese, to the Apostolic Prefects of each Apostolic Vicariate, need to cooperate with all Catholics. I personally also hope to receive your suggestions, and I will carefully consider them and put them into practice. May the Holy Spirit enlighten us and guide us so that we can steadily embark on the path of building the Church and the country. I only send you the Pope's blessing. May the Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, bless all the listeners. Amen.

### Gu Zhenggang and Wang Maogong to Inspect Northern Jiangsu in the Coming Days. Refugee Relief Association Established in Zhenjiang

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 14th] The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association was formally established in Zhenjiang on the 14th. Minister Gu Zhenggang also revealed his determination at a reception for reporters from the provincial capital at 4 PM, saying that disaster relief is like putting out a fire, and that the weak, disabled, and refugee youth will be given priority relief. He brought 511 million yuan from the central government, of which 200 million yuan will be remitted to Xuzhou for emergency relief, and the remaining funds will be used to improve the refugee reception centers in northern Jiangsu. As for the 5,000 tons of flour from the UNRRA, it will be transported from Shanghai to Zhenjiang within days and distributed by name. He will personally go to Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou, Xuzhou, and Haizhou to establish offices within a week, and then go to Shanghai to launch a fundraising campaign for 2 billion yuan for disaster relief.

[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 14th] Minister Gu and Chairman Wang are scheduled to leave Zhenjiang on the 17th to inspect various parts of northern Jiangsu. In addition, Gu and Director Chiang Tingfu agreed that drugs worth approximately 200 million yuan will be transported here soon, and 100 doctors and nurses will be sent to provide services. In the future, it is planned to establish hospitals in various refugee concentration areas, and the cost of various affairs will require 180 million yuan. [Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 14th] Chairman Wang Maogong met with reporters on the 14th and said: More than 30 of the 61 counties in Jiangsu have now been occupied by the Communist army. Only four counties in northern Jiangsu have not been occupied. The people who have escaped have all fallen into starvation, while those who have not escaped are still trapped in deep water and urgently need to be rescued. There are currently more than 7 million refugees in various places. Although the government has various relief efforts, they are only temporary solutions. The fundamental solution is to allow them to return to their hometowns as soon as possible and turn consumers into producers. At present, the basic force of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu is more than 30,000 people, plus about 30,000 local miscellaneous troops, totaling about 70,000 people, which is not a large number and the strength is limited, but since the ceasefire agreement was signed on January 10, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has still been attacking everywhere in Tongzhou and Haizhou. Wang also said: After the Provincial Assembly closes, he will go to various places for inspection. The local finances of Jiangsu are currently very difficult. The budget approved by the central government is only 6 billion yuan. From July 1, the finances of each county can be slightly more affluent, but the provincial finances will be even more difficult, because the land tax revenue originally belonged to the province, and in the future will only be 20%, and the other 80% will be distributed to the counties and the central government.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] This reporter recently learned from relevant sources that civil servants of various ministries and commissions of the central government are suffering from the rising cost of living and the delay in adjusting their treatment.

He also presented a scroll in court, listing his deeds of rescuing anti-Japanese martyrs and covering underground work to prove that he had contributed to the War of Resistance, and requested the court to reduce his punishment. At 12:30 PM, the court ordered a rescheduled trial, and Zhou was returned to custody.

### Local Communications. UNRRA Allocates New Agricultural Tools to Anhui. Demonstration Farms Established in Six Counties

Jiaxing: Town Head Commits Suicide Due to Pressure to Collect Military Grain

The procurement of military grain in Jiaxing is urgently needed, but despite appeals and petitions to relevant central, provincial, and county leaders by representatives from all walks of life, the effects have been minimal. Only recently did Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie agree to advance all the funds for grain procurement, with the remainder to be paid after the autumn harvest. However, the county government, upon receiving the provincial order, issued grain certificates and dispatched personnel to supervise the collection. The town heads of various towns resigned one after another due to their inability to cope. Xu Fangxian, the town head of Shuangqiao Town in the county, was refused permission to resign and convened a meeting of wealthy households and town representatives, but no solution was found. He then secretly ingested a gold ring yesterday, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, his wife discovered it and called for medical assistance, and he is no longer in danger of death.

### Editorial: Reflections on the Fall of the House of Savoy

This newspaper reported yesterday, citing a London dispatch, that according to an announcement by the Italian Royal Family, the Italian King has already left Rome by plane for Portugal. Last night's Rome dispatch also stated that the royal standard on the royal palace where the Italian King resided was officially lowered at 4:50 PM on the 13th. Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi has also been ordered by the cabinet to serve as acting head of state of Italy and announced the results of the plebiscite, with the people voting in favor of abolishing the monarchy. Victory belongs to the Republic, and the establishment of the Republic can be announced at any time. The bloodless revolution previously carried out in Italy has now been successfully completed. The House of Savoy was abandoned by the Italian people and had no choice but to quietly leave the country, sharing the fate of other deposed dynasties in overseas exile. This is another test of democracy.

From this test in Italy, it can be seen that the public's understanding of politics will definitely not be blindly followed. The general education level of the Italian people is not as high as that of Britain and the United States, and for more than 20 years, they have been under the control of Mussolini's fascism. Many people are quite concerned about the outcome of this election in Italy. What is the concern? Italy is experiencing post-war turmoil, order has not been restored, the land is barren, and the people are poor. The general public fears famine, and under these circumstances, they cannot withstand the incitement of schemers and can easily unknowingly fall into a political trap. The result will make the future of Italy itself and the whole of Europe precarious. However, the outcome of this election proves that this over-concern was unnecessary. Therefore, we should be even more convinced that, under the normal course of democracy, public opinion cannot be fabricated, and those who rely on democracy and merely chant high-sounding slogans will inevitably fail in a truly democratic setting.

There is also a point here that deserves our attention. That is, the Catholic Party won a great victory in this Italian general election. Generally, it was believed that the Catholic Party was a right-wing conservative party that would support the monarchy. However, while the Catholic Party won a great victory in the Italian general election, the Italian monarchy was actually defeated in this general election, and the leader who announced the abolition of the monarchy was the leader of the Catholic Party, the current Italian Prime Minister, De Gasperi, who is now serving as the acting head of state of Italy. This also shows that it is a mistaken prejudice to lump the Catholic Party together with the old-fashioned royalist party. Among Catholics, there are certainly diehards, but what the Catholic creed represents should not be stubbornness, but rather renewal that keeps pace with the times.

The House of Savoy has now followed the Habsburgs, the Manchus, the Romanovs, and other historical dynasties, becoming relics of history! This is an irresistible historical destiny. Since the establishment of the House of Savoy, it has driven out foreign troops, unified Italy, and established the foundation of modern Italy. Its contribution to the awakening of Italian national consciousness and the establishment of a nation-state will be recorded in history. Fair historians will naturally not erase its achievements simply because of its current demise. In the 1850s, Italy was still a geographical term, not a unified country. By taking advantage of the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War to unify Italy, the House of Savoy, which rose in northern Italy, established the foundation of the modern Italian nation-state. At that time, it was where the loyalty of the Italian people belonged, and now the fiercest supporters of abolishing the Italian monarchy are also from the birthplace of the House of Savoy in northern Italy. What an interesting contrast this is, showing how ruthless the destiny of history is. This can also give those in power, whether groups or individuals, a sincere and cautionary lesson. A government that has lost the hearts of the people, even if it has made great contributions to the country and the nation in the past, the people are not obligated to elect to retain it.

In 1923, Italy was in a state of economic decline and social unrest after the Great War. The Blackshirts led by Mussolini entered Rome from Milan, and the King ordered him to form a government. Mussolini's rule of Italy resulted in the Italian people suffering and ending up in their current situation. The House of Savoy naturally cannot escape its due responsibility. As a result, it was finally abandoned by the people and went into exile. This makes us think of the Japanese Imperial Family. The military and political figures who instigated Japan's aggression are certainly to blame, but the responsibility borne by the Japanese Imperial Family is also undeniable, at least not lighter than that of the House of Savoy in Italy. But we still see the Japanese Emperor going scot-free, without any sanctions. Does this mean that the Japanese Imperial Family is truly divinely ordained? To thoroughly prevent Japan from re-aggressing, we must first destroy Japan's theocratic ideology, and to achieve this goal, we must overthrow the idol of Japanese theocratic ideology—the Japanese Imperial Family. If the Japanese Emperor is still safe and sound, it will cause the Japanese people to have the illusion that he himself may be a "god," so he is eternally unchanging and cannot be overthrown. Fortunately, there is now the Allied Control Council for Japan, and the Emperor's rule is still subject to the control of the Allied Supreme Commander. Looking at the fall of the Italian monarchy, we must ask: when will we be able to invite the Japanese Imperial Family to the historical museum as well?

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Reopens Today; Byrnes and Others Arrive in Paris One After Another Yesterday; Soviet Radio Attacks US Policy Again

[Our Newspaper's News] London, 14th Broadcasting: US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Paris one after another this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also arrived shortly afterwards. The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened as scheduled tomorrow afternoon, starting with a discussion of the conference agenda.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] US Secretary of State Byrnes and Senators Connally and Vandenberg flew to Paris on the presidential plane "Sacred Cow" at 5:20 PM today to attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. President Truman personally went to the airport to see them off and wished them a "safe journey." This is unprecedented in American history, and diplomatic circles believe that this move is of great significance, showing the deep concern of the United States for European issues. Before Byrnes and others boarded the plane, they took a photo with President Truman and their wives. Byrnes jokingly said to the President, "Why don't you take this plane to Paris and meet with us?" The President, seeing these three politicians leave the country, seemed to have some feelings and replied, "Yes, I will go to Paris to meet you." Another report from Paris: the 36-member Soviet delegation arrived in Paris today afternoon from Smolko.

[Reuters, London, 14th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew to Paris by plane this afternoon. About 60 staff members had arrived in France before Bevin.

[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] The US delegation to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference arrived here tonight. According to a certain representative, Secretary of State Byrnes will firmly uphold the established policy of the United States at the conference and will not compromise on various disputes regarding the treaties with European countries. What is unknown is whether Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov can refrain from being stubborn? If he continues to be self-isolated, this conference will inevitably end without results in a short period of time. The representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have today completed the drafting of the report, including all the points of disagreement, which will be submitted to the respective Foreign Ministers for review on Saturday. After the last meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, representatives were appointed to continue the meeting, trying to reduce major disputes to minor ones and minor ones to none. However, up to now, only concrete agreements have been reached on minor points on which the Four Foreign Ministers have already agreed in principle. The Four Foreign Ministers are scheduled to hold their first meeting on Saturday, at which time they will only decide on the agenda. The pending issues to be discussed thereafter include the issue of sovereignty over Trieste in the Italian treaty and the issue of Soviet troops stationed in Bulgaria. The future of Germany is the fundamental issue of the overall European situation. Byrnes also intends to submit the Austrian issue for discussion.

[United Press, London, 14th] On the eve of the Quadripartite Conference, Moscow Radio launched a satirical attack today on US policy in the Far East and Latin America, accusing the United States of wanting to control the military strength of Latin American countries and claiming that the decision-makers of US policy are seeking unconditional preferential rights in the Far East.

[Associated Press, London, 13th] Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk today. Officials did not disclose the content of the talks, but well-informed sources said that the two discussed the Czech request to cede four districts of Silesia in the Prussian province, which, according to the Potsdam Declaration, are under the jurisdiction of Poland.

### Connally's Remarks: The United States Will Firmly Oppose Attempts to Control the World

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] Connally delivered a televised speech after boarding the plane, frankly considering the possibility of failure of the Paris conference. In his speech, he reiterated his condemnation of the "group" policy, opened up avenues for continued negotiations in the world, and proposed convening a 21-nation conference to deal with pending issues if the Paris conference fails. Connally said: If the Paris conference fails, governments can sign separate agreements. It is inconceivable that the veto of one of the foreign ministers will hinder the restoration of peace. In short, any attempt by a single country to dominate the world is firmly opposed by the United States.

### Socialism and Communism: Blum Says They Can Never Merge

[Agence France-Presse, Plymouth, England, 13th] Blum, the leader of the French Socialist Party, recently spoke to the British Labour Party Congress on behalf of socialists throughout Europe, especially Western Europe, stating: Socialism and Communism cannot merge at this time, nor can they merge in the future, until all Communist parties believe in the sincerity of democracy and their independence and autonomy from Soviet policy no longer cause doubt. The Communist Party borrows the name of democracy, and the Catholic Democratic Party borrows the name of socialism, competing with each other for the entire population of Europe and capitalism, thus dividing them into three groups. If a one-party government is to be established, it is virtually impossible. The only possibility is for the Socialist Party and the Communist Party to merge and establish a proletarian government, but I oppose such a merger. I am also saddened by the instability of domestic politics in various countries, which causes power and responsibility to circulate among the three parties. This is the current situation in France.

[Associated Press, Plymouth, England, 13th] Blum spoke at the British Labour Party annual meeting today as a comrade, and the entire venue responded with warm applause. When he mentioned that the policies of the French Socialist Party and the British Labour Party "do not completely coincide," the applause was even louder. It is said that "on the Spanish issue, the French have different opinions from you" is an example of the difference between the policies of the French Socialist Party and the British Labour Party.

### Truman Visit to Soviet Union: White House Absolutely Denies

[US Information Service, Washington, 13th] The White House today referred to the London newspaper's claim that if the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference does not achieve the expected results, President Truman may visit Moscow to meet with Stalin as "pure speculation."

### US Republican Congressmen: Accuse of Money Diplomacy; Using the Export-Import Bank as a Tool

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] At a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee today, Republican Congressmen Jensen and Bolleaux spoke out, accusing the Export-Import Bank, the largest tool of the government's money diplomacy policy, of becoming a means of avoiding congressional approval of foreign loans. The two Congressmen also criticized other state-run companies that are not subject to congressional oversight.

[The news item "US House of Representatives Passes Loan Bill to Britain" published in this newspaper yesterday omitted the words "Banking Committee" due to unclear reception at the time of recording. This is corrected here.]

[US Information Service, Washington, 13th] Foreign Liquidation Commissioner McCabe announced today that the US has signed a loan agreement with the Finnish government, extending a loan of US$5 million (in addition to the US$10 million loaned earlier this year) to purchase US surplus goods in Europe.

### UN Assistant Secretary-General Proposes Using Economic Sanctions to Deal with Potential Aggression

[US Information Service, New York, 13th] UN Assistant Secretary-General Laugier proposed on the 10th that the UN create a civilian agency to study the use of economic sanctions to deal with potential aggressors. The proposed new agency will become a civilian agency counterpart to the UN Military Staff Committee.

### British Empire Should Implement Zonal Defense System

Recommendation by Former British Commissioner to the Middle East

[Associated Press, London, 13th] Sir Gilbert Clayton, former British Commissioner to the Middle East, proposed today that the British Empire should be divided into zones to ensure national defense security. Britain is a major part of the regional defense system, with each dominion separately controlling its sphere of influence. Western Europe and the Middle East are the responsibility of Britain, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific are the responsibility of Australia and New Zealand, and the defense of Africa is the responsibility of the Union of South Africa. The defense plan for North America is the simplest.

### Italian King Reluctantly Leaves Homeland; Well-Wishers at Airport Burst into Tears

[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] When King Umberto of Italy boarded the plane to Portugal today, Associated Press reporters witnessed men and women seeing him off, bursting into tears and repeatedly shouting goodbye. Umberto, however, often smiled and finally shook hands with reporters to say goodbye. After all ten people traveling with him had entered the plane, he also boarded the plane. Minutes after the royal palace announced that Umberto was "flying directly to Lisbon," another message was issued stating that the plane would stop in Madrid so that the Italian Ambassador to Spain, Scotti, could disembark.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 13th] The Italian King left Beijing by private plane. Before his departure, the driver refused to drive for him, preferring to die rather than exile the King to a foreign country, so another driver was substituted. Prime Minister De Gasperi and members of the royal family saw him off at the airport. The plane carrying the Italian King, protected by four Allied fighter planes, flew around the city for a week before flying west.

Leaves Declaration Before Departure; Protests Against Illegal Actions of Cabinet

Before leaving the country, the Italian King left a declaration, requesting that it be published at 10:00 PM that day. The content emphasized the King's intention to avoid civil strife. It stated in brief: "Before the Supreme Court announces the results of the referendum, I believe that the King has the right to retain his position. However, in violation of the law and national sovereignty, the cabinet took unilateral and arbitrary action last night to seize power, forcing me to choose between submission and bloodshed. The Italian nation has just been rescued from the Great War, and the borders are threatened. My people have already suffered greatly. I will do everything within my power to prevent them from suffering again. The judicial power of Italy has always been independent and free, becoming the glorious tradition of Italy. I believe that it will be able to act freely. I do not want to use force to resist injustice, nor do I want to sit idly by and watch the illegal actions of the government. I can only leave my homeland and make a sacrifice for the greatest benefit of my homeland. Therefore, in the name of the people and the King, I protest against this atrocity. Long live Italy!"

### Regarding the Spanish Issue: US Proposes Compromise; Soviet Representative Objects; Decision Postponed Until Next Week

[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Soviet Representative to the UN Security Council Gromyko today criticized the US proposal to refer the Franco problem in Spain to the UN General Assembly for discussion. Gromyko said: If the Council accepts this US proposal, it will create a dangerous precedent, meaning that the Security Council has "evaded its responsibilities." At today's meeting of the Security Council, Moromiko completely disagreed with the amendment to the Spanish issue but did not exercise his veto power. The meeting decided to temporarily adjourn until 7:30 PM next Monday.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Telephone communications between Britain and Spain and Gibraltar will be restored on the 17th of this month.

### Atomic Bomb: US Willing to Destroy Manufactured Bombs if All Countries Can Properly Control Them; Remarks by US Representative at Atomic Energy Commission

[Our Newspaper's News] San Francisco, 14th Broadcasting: At today's meeting of the UN Atomic Energy Commission, US Representative Baruch declared that if all countries in the world can properly control atomic bombs, the United States may agree to destroy its manufactured atomic bombs and stop manufacturing them in the future.

### US Army Stationed Abroad: Currently Still 800,000; 5,000 Remain in Our Country

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] According to the Army Department's annual report, a large number of US Army personnel were dispatched to various countries to assist in combat during the war. Now that the war has ended, US troops are being demobilized and returning home one after another. From December 1941 to September 1945, the US Army dispatched 7.3 million personnel to overseas combat, carrying equipment totaling 126,859,000 tons. Currently, there are 350,000 US troops stationed in Germany, 200,000 in Japan, and only 250,000 scattered in other locations. The Army Department plans to reduce the number of Army personnel to 1.55 million by the first of next month, of which 797,000 will be stationed abroad. The current mission of these US troops is merely to maintain traffic, take care of war brides, dispose of surplus assets, comfort displaced people, and perform other peaceful occupation tasks. As for the US troops in the UK and Scotland, which once numbered 1.5 million, only 4,500 remained last month. Today, in fact, no US troops are stationed in the UK anymore.

In the China-India-Burma Theater, the US military reached a maximum of 250,000 at the end of the war, of which 175,000 were in the India-Burma Theater and 75,000 in the China Theater. There are now only 400 US troops in India and Burma, and the rest have been demobilized and returned home or transferred to other theaters. These 400 people will continue to be responsible for clearing surplus materials.

The China Theater was declared closed on May 1st, and no US combat troops remain in China. However, Marine Corps Air Force and ground troops remain in North China. According to Army statistics, there are currently 5,000 US soldiers remaining in China. US military supplies in China have been sold to China for 67 million yuan, about 50% of the original value.

In Korea, US troops landed in Korea on September 8 last year, totaling three divisions. Two divisions are currently stationed in the area south of the 38th parallel in Korea, and the 40th Division has been demobilized and returned home. However, the exact number of US troops in Korea is still unknown. US troops will not withdraw from Korea until a government is established in Korea in accordance with the Moscow Tripartite Agreement.

In Japan and the Pacific, the US military totaled 1,690,000 on October 1 last year. There are now 393,000, including the occupying forces in Japan.

The Pacific Air Force once had 196,000 personnel and 5,500 aircraft, but now there are only about 50,000 personnel left.

### U.S. Engineers Committee Suggests Disarming Japanese Industry, Aims to Eliminate its Combat Potential

Far Eastern Commission Approves a Portion of Japanese Industry for Reparations

[United States Information Service, Washington, 13th] After seven months of research, the National Engineers Committee of the United States has submitted a seven-point plan regarding the disarming of Japanese industry to the Secretary of State and the Secretaries of the Army and Navy, which was announced yesterday by the Department of the Army. The committee recommends prohibiting: (1) the nitrogen synthesis fixation method, (2) the manufacture of synthetic liquid fuels, (3) the manufacture of lead and magnesium, (4) the use of nuclear energy. It also recommends restricting (1) the production of sulfuric acid and calcium carbide, (2) the productivity and output of steel mills and steel product factories, and (3) the productivity and output of copper mills. The report points out: "Completely eliminating Japan's industry and making its entire population rely solely on agriculture and fishing is practically impossible, and world opinion would not support such action." At the same time, the report states that a plan must be developed to "control Japan's war potential, even after the army occupation ends." Another goal of the committee's recommendations is to allow Japan's non-combat potential to develop safely in the form of free investment. The committee's recommendations for controlling the fuel industry are extensive, and the committee recommends creating a fuel control system to ensure that Japan's fuel supply is equal to the needs of Japanese industry. For Japanese scientific research, the committee only offers a simple solution: dismantle laboratories used for wartime purposes and prohibit the establishment of any scientific research institutions, as these institutions could potentially be converted for military use. In addition, special attention is paid to prohibiting any research related to the manufacture of atomic bombs.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 13th] Yesterday, the Far Eastern Commission approved a policy statement on the temporary removal of Japanese industry as reparations, including the steel industry, thermal power industry, soda ash industry, chlorine gas, and caustic soda industry. Committee Chairman McCoy told reporters yesterday that the committee has completed action on all industries listed in the report of the U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley to the President regarding the plan for temporary reparations removal from Japan. However, he pointed out that the Far Eastern Commission's reparations subcommittee is currently considering recommendations for the temporary removal of other industries (not included in the Pauley report).

### Discussing the Food Crisis but Entertaining Guests with Fine Food

Japanese Prime Minister Makes a Fool of Himself

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Yesterday, Prime Minister Yoshida invited political leaders to a luncheon to discuss the food crisis, but entertained them with fine food and wine, which caused a dispute. The Japanese government issued a proclamation on the food crisis yesterday, but only two hours later, Yoshida invited guests to a luncheon. Communist representative Tokuda was also present. Seeing a table full of bread, vegetables, soup, fried fish, and beer, he immediately shouted that the Prime Minister should not be so extravagant, refused to eat, and angrily left the meeting.

### 200,000 U.S. Sailors Prepare to Strike Starting Today

Government is Working Hard to Mediate

### Industry Has Reached the Brink of Total Collapse, Ten Factories Have Closed Down, Many More are Applying for Permission to Close, All Industries are Considering Layoffs and Salary Cuts, When Will the Production Conference Be Held?

According to Zhao Banfu, Director of the Social Labor Department: the industrial crisis has been worsening in recent days. Factories in various industries are facing pressure from wages, interest rates, and the import of foreign goods, and have begun to show signs of total collapse. Currently, the department has records of ten factories that have closed down. Two more factories have requested permission to close down, and three factories have requested to lay off employees and cut salaries. Such situations are increasing daily. If measures are not taken to remedy the situation, the total collapse of the national economy is imminent. To remedy this crisis, Zhao proposed two suggestions: (1) The government should provide unlimited industrial loans at low interest rates. (2) Coordinate labor-management disputes and strictly crack down on illegal acts such as violence and coercion.

Further report: Yesterday, reporters interviewed leaders from various industries to inquire about the production situation in their respective industries. Summarizing their talks, the following points were made: (1) There is a shortage of raw materials, and costs are too high. (2) Wages account for 25% of the total cost, increasing costs. (Before the war, it only accounted for 5% of the total cost.) (3) Interest accounts for 20% of the total cost. If calculated from the time raw materials are purchased to the time finished products are sold, it takes two months, and the interest accounts for 40% of the total cost of the finished products. (4) Foreign goods are pouring in, and domestic products cannot compete with them. Therefore, currently, various industries are considering layoffs, salary cuts, tightening operations, and closing down. It is reported that one-third of the knitting factories in this city have already stopped production, and the remaining two-thirds are considering closing down. Various industries hope that the production conference can be convened as soon as possible to save private industry from disaster.

### Unemployed Workers from the No. 2 Gongda Factory Appeal, Most Workers Returning from the Rear Area Have Fallen Ill

[Our report] Unemployed workers from the No. 2 Gongda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu hosted reporters yesterday. According to the report: The No. 2 Gongda Cotton Mill had a total of 52,000 spindles before the war. After the Pearl Harbor incident, the Japanese transported most of the factory's machinery to the British-owned Louchang Factory in Pudong. Unexpectedly, after the victory, the Louchang authorities seized the machinery. The Gongda workers submitted a document to the Social Bureau, which transferred it to the Louchang authorities for negotiation, but to no avail. As a result, Gongda could not resume operations, and 1,656 workers were unemployed.

Father and Three Sons Tragically Died by Poison

Before and After Rong Yongming's Arrest

Visiting Wuchang Rice Store and Discussing Rice Business with Rice Merchants

Rong's Wife Cries, Saying She Has Done Nothing Wrong

[Report from Our Newspaper] The summons of Rong Yongming of Wuchang Rice Store was the first decisive move by the authorities to address the serious rice crisis in the city, which aroused great attention from all sectors at the time. However, after the exposure of the inside story of the grain loan case, Rong Yongming's case seemed to have become a small ripple in comparison. Advertisements appeared in the newspapers from fifty-six grain merchants and Rong Yongming's family, calling for justice. The reporter wanted to find out the truth and visited Rong's family and Wuchang Rice Store in person.

Wuchang Rice Store rents two rooms upstairs at No. 22, Guizhou Road. The office is no different from a regular office. Several partners in the store, hearing that the reporter had arrived, seemed to have been given a chance to appeal, filled with grievances, eager for the reporter to swallow them whole.

Talking about the incident on May 23, they said: Rong Yongming did not raise the market price of early rice to 55,000 yuan that day. In fact, Wuchang sold fifty dan of early rice at a market price of 51,500 yuan that day. The buyers were Yingji, Yuanyuan, Rendagong, and Yufeng Rice Stores. All of this can be verified by the accounts.

Rong Yongming was summoned on the afternoon of May 23, and Wuchang's account books were taken away with him. After the authorities questioned him, Rong Yongming provided a guarantee from Wanshengxin Sauce Garden and returned home that day. It is said that the next day, the authorities sent four accountants to work with Chen Zuobin, the accountant of the store, and took the store's account books to the relevant rice stores and customers for verification one by one, and nothing unusual was heard. On May 31, the authorities summoned Rong Yongming again, saying that he was going to retrieve the account books, but he never returned. On the 10th of this month, it was heard that he had been sent to the Garrison Headquarters. However, since Rong Yongming was detained for the second time, Wuchang has temporarily closed, and the firms and businesses that deal with Wuchang have been ordered to freeze their accounts with Wuchang.

On the morning of June 12, Chen Zuobin, the accountant of the store, was summoned again. It is said that after the authorities checked the store's account books, they discovered that the store had earned illegal commissions of 1.8 million yuan from May 1 to May 23, and ordered that the full amount be paid immediately to be used for charitable purposes, otherwise, people would be detained. People in Wuchang said: The manager has been detained, and the bank accounts have been frozen, so where would the cash come from? Moreover, currently, the commission for selling rice on behalf of customers is 1,000 yuan per dan, but sometimes the goods have not been sold, and the entrusting customers urgently need money to buy rice in the producing areas, and they are often willing to depreciate the price for the rice store to advance the money to buy. Once the rice store has bought it, it is its own goods. Profits and losses depend entirely on the market price fluctuations. For example, in April, due to the frequent downward trend of rice prices, more than one million yuan was lost. In May, rice prices rose, and sometimes each dan earned five or six thousand yuan, which is also a fact. From the beginning of this year to the present, a total of more than four million yuan has been earned. However, the two million yuan at the beginning of the year could buy 200 dan of rice, and now the principal and interest add up to more than six million yuan, which is only enough to buy more than 120 dan of rice. How can there be the ability to hoard 2,000 bags of rice? From this ratio, the profits simply do not make up for the losses, so it seems that one cannot simply look at the profit side and ignore the loss side.

The case has not been concluded yet. When the reporter went to visit Rong's family again, in an old-fashioned residence on Fuxing East Road, he met Rong Zhou, who had published an advertisement in the newspaper to appeal for her husband. She looks like a typical housewife, with an old mother, two sons, and two daughters. As a tenant of three rooms, she rents a whole floor from someone else. She sobbed and didn't know where to start. She said: The whole family depends on Rong Yongming for a living, and recently two more children have been sick, and Rong Yongming has never done anything wrong in the past. She hopes that he can be cleared of injustice and return soon… The reporter was at a loss, and could only echo: Those who have done nothing wrong will be cleared of injustice soon.

Reaching the way back, the case of Rong Yongming of Wuchang Rice Store still raised a big question mark in the reporter's mind? We don't ask who it is, we must find out the truth, who is the real culprit in the entire rice wave? Finally, the reporter has to borrow the words of a powerful person: "Investigate and handle impartially"!

Robbing a Bride

Ju Zhuzhu Cries for Help

The Groom Is Too Impatient

The Parents-in-Law Become Foes

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Rusheng, a resident of Nianjiu No. 9, Zhenxiu Branch Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, from Nantong, has a son named Renfa, 23 years old. In February of this year, he was engaged through a matchmaker to Ju Wang, a Ningbo native, whose daughter Zhuzhu (22 years old) lived at No. 8, Hujia Alley. Recently, young relatives have been visiting the home frequently, and Renfa has felt very uneasy, fearing that if things go on for too long, something will happen. Therefore, Rusheng chose a wedding date and entrusted the matchmaker to formally marry the bride. However, Zhuzhu replied that the wedding would have to wait until three years later. This made the Zhang family even more suspicious. At about 10 o'clock last night, they invited the matchmaker and others to take decisive action and forcibly rob the bride. First, they broke into the house and beat the mother and daughter. Then, they carried Zhuzhu away. When they passed the Pudong Patrol Team of the City Fanli Garrison Department, the guard at the gate heard cries for help and saw a group of people carrying a woman. Fearing something unexpected, he led the team to question them and learned the inside story. However, the act of robbing the bride was a restriction of freedom, so he sent a letter to the Yangjing Branch for investigation. The two sides insisted on their own versions, and there was no way to reconcile. Today, they were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning.

Education Minister Zhu Jiahua Arrives in Shanghai

To Attend the Board Meeting of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund

Fourth National Education Conference to Be Held This Autumn

[Report from the Central News Agency in this city] Education Minister Zhu Jiahua flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 5 p.m. on the 13th to attend the board meeting of the Sino-British Education and Culture Fund. The Central News Agency reporter visited him yesterday and raised various education issues. Mr. Zhu's answers were as follows: (1) To adjust the treatment of educational personnel, the Ministry is making its best efforts. Because it involves a wider range, it can only slightly increase the research funding for fire school first. (2) For the demobilized young soldiers, the Ministry of Education has sent them back to their original schools for reinstatement in accordance with the established procedures. (3) In order to handle study abroad education and general cultural liaison matters, the Ministry of Education will set up cultural counselors in the embassies of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. (4) The provincial investigation of education and cultural losses during the Anti-Japanese War has been completed, and evidence will be submitted to Japan for compensation in the future. (5) The re-education of Japan will be carried out jointly with the Allied countries in accordance with the principles in the Chairman's victory broadcast. (6) The education budget for this year is not significantly different from the actual revenue and expenditure needs, and an additional budget will be requested. (7) The Fourth National Education Conference is scheduled to be held this autumn. (8) In order to develop national physique, attention should be paid to physical training in the future. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of talents in this area, which needs to be strengthened.

According to Li Zixiu, a commissioner of the Ministry of Education: The Board of Directors of the Sino-British Education and Culture Fund has not formally met since the Pacific War because Vice President Gaut and Marshall were detained in concentration camps by the enemy. The first meeting after the victory will be held in Shanghai on the 15th of this month (today), presided over by Zhu Jiahua, who is also the president. Directors Chen Qicai, Liu Ruiheng, and Ye Gongchuo will all attend. The Secretary-General, Hang Limin, will also come to Shanghai in the next few days to participate in the discussion of the distribution of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund. The meeting will last for two days.

Free Talk - Creating Mania - Shao Fu

It is said that municipal construction has various grand plans again.

What with building large bridges over the Huangpu River, and underground trams... Shanghai isn't up to par with the scale of New York, London, or Paris, it's certainly a bit undignified.

We ordinary citizens are naturally happy to hear such good news. But after being happy, when we turn our heads to think again, we feel a sudden loss. Why is that? For example, the handling of night soil still relies on the "night soil collectors", most of the trams don't stop at Yokohama Bridge or Haining Road, the asphalt roads are covered in scars, hawkers fill the sidewalks, the Suzhou Creek stinks to high heaven... I have no profound theories, just want to be pragmatic. We only hope that the roads can be leveled, the garbage swept clean, that the monstrous cars stop rushing around in the city, and that more trams and buses are available. We would be satisfied with just that.

Everyone knows that building a new road is easier to show results and gain favor than repairing a broken one. So, officials, whether new or old, all have a "creation mania." Thus, new roads increase daily, while old roads become more dilapidated daily. Many people say that the affairs of officials can often be viewed in this way. Frankly, what we need is a group of practical fools who will enrich and perfect the existing work first. If there is energy to spare, then we can think about great achievements.

Because beggars are not interested in German steak or Italian pasta.

My Orderly - Ju Yin

Last winter, I was suddenly ordered to transfer from headquarters to serve in the artillery battalion. When I arrived at the company, I was surrounded by a group of strangers. Not only was I unaccustomed to the environment, but I also felt somewhat awkward in my daily life. This was because I had lost a helper. I thought to myself, how convenient it would be if I could bring my orderly, Chen Jingde! But now, what's done is done, and it can't be done. In my boredom, I went to consult my old brother, Battalion Commander Shang. "Brother Shang, could you transfer a Northerner from your company of old, weak, and disabled soldiers to be my orderly?" He argued with me at first, but in the end, he agreed to my request.

I sat wearily at my desk, thinking that I couldn't be as casual in the company as I was in the staff office, especially with the newly arrived orderly. I should put on a bit of an air of authority. Yes, that's what I'll do.

"Report!" came the Northern accent. I understood his purpose completely. First, I put on a stern face, and then said in a very stiff tone, "Come in."

Yes, this was indeed a typical Northerner, just a little short.

"Are you Li Chunbao?" I asked with the demeanor of a judge examining a criminal.

"Yes," he replied crisply, standing as straight as a flagpole.

"Where are you from?" "Xihua County, Henan." "Are you willing to be my orderly?" "Willing."

I asked him some questions about his past, and at the same time, I was "reading his face." I was most afraid that he would have a rebellious bone. Finally, I asked him with concern, "Why did you join the army?" "Reporting, company commander, because my wife was abducted by someone, so I joined the army." When I heard this, I couldn't help but burst out laughing. I didn't have time to think about "authority" anymore. So I had to comfort him a few times and tell him to go back and pack his luggage and move over immediately.

In the first few days, it seemed that he was also unfamiliar with the place, and he just sat in front of me all day waiting for orders. When I was tired of reading, I would look at him, and he would stare back. "Okay?" I asked to break the silence. "Reporting, company commander, very good." He replied as usual. Sometimes I would fall asleep when I was tired of writing, and when I woke up, he was still sitting there, truly a good companion. I couldn't help but praise him. "Go and play! What are you doing sitting here all the time?" He seemed to have encountered an eviction notice and left disappointedly. But in less than a quarter of an hour, he would be sitting there again. I thought to myself, Northerners are really different from Southerners. I probably wouldn't find such a docile and conscientious orderly in the South.

One day, I went out with friends. When I came back in the evening, the floor was a mess under the electric light. So I said to him, "Why do you just know how to sit there? Can't you even sweep the floor?"

"Reporting, company commander, it's only been two days since I swept!" he replied reasonably.

"Oh! How often do you plan to sweep?"

"Once every Saturday should be about right." When I heard this, I didn't know whether to be angry, to pity him, to be angry, or to laugh. But I thought that getting angry at him and scolding him would only confuse him more. So I had to tell him gently that he had to sweep at least twice a day. The first time was in the morning, and the second time was at dusk. When he heard this, he opened his mouth and didn't move, just blinked a few times, as if he was still dreaming.

"Chunbao, go, go," I pushed him and continued, "Just do it like that tomorrow. You can go to sleep now, it doesn't matter." He hesitated for a moment before dragging his heavy steps away. After he left, I couldn't help but feel that there were still such uncivilized people in the world. Then, I felt a sense of sympathy for him. He really didn't understand anything.

The second time, I came home later. As soon as I stepped into the room, I felt that the room was particularly fresh. Indeed, he was still sitting there. Looking closely, I realized that the floor had been washed. This made me very happy. I immediately patted him on the shoulder and said, "Great, great, you've worked too hard. You don't need to do anything now. Just go to sleep!" He gave me a wry smile and left triumphantly. This was the first time I had seen him smile. After he left, I wrote in my diary with ease. After I finished writing, I felt very hungry. Wasn't it true? I had lunch at twelve o'clock. Now that the orderly was asleep, I couldn't wake him up. Living in this rural area of Xujiahui, I couldn't buy anything. I thought to myself, I might as well be a little like Ah Q and pretend that this was the battlefield. Thinking of this, I took off my clothes and went to bed without hesitation. But my stomach was grumbling, and I couldn't fall asleep for a long time. Then, the rats were banging on the small tin pot, making a clanging noise. I got up impatiently and put the pot away, but unexpectedly, I was hit by a fishy smell. This made me feel as if a traveler in the desert had found a water source. So I relit the electric light and ate heartily. Because I was so hungry, I even forgot the saltiness. After eating my fill, I drank all the water. As a result, I didn't fall asleep until one o'clock in the middle of the night.

At eight o'clock the next morning, I was still in a daze when I suddenly heard the orderly cursing. I said with my eyes closed, "Don't make so much noise! What are you cursing about?"

"Reporting, company commander, the fish I left for you yesterday was all eaten by the rats," he complained. I vaguely heard "rats" and "fish" and couldn't help but laugh. "Ha! Ha! Forget it, forget it," I hummed, because I was really too tired. But he was still cursing. I felt really impatient, so I raised my voice and said, "Don't make so much noise! Your credit is noted!" This time, he stopped talking.

After a while, he said in surprise, "Hey! Rats can even use chopsticks and spoons?" I just didn't respond. After another while, he said in surprise again, "Hey! How did the water get drunk up too?" This time, I was so angry that I fainted. I don't know why, but I jumped up like a fully wound spring and shouted, "What are you shouting about? What are you shouting about? I ate it! I ate it!" He saw that the situation was not good and left without a word. I wanted to sleep again, but it seemed that the fire of anger had driven away the sleeping god, so I had to get up. After I got up, I called him in. I originally wanted to scold him to vent my anger. But when his serious and pitiful face appeared in front of me, my anger dissipated. I thought to myself, he's just too stupid. This is definitely not him satirizing me, let alone him deliberately making noise to disturb me, but a way for him to show off his contribution to me! So I had to turn my anger into joy and asked, "It was really me who ate it. Do the rats in your Henan know how to use chopsticks and spoons?" He gave me a silly smile and then suddenly replied, "That's right! I thought the rats in Shanghai were different!" I rubbed my eyes and had to give him a wry smile.

It was a spring dusk, and the bright red sun was soaking in a golden sunset. I was leaning on the window alone, gazing at the wilderness. My clear mind and enthusiastic passion were awakened in the embrace of spring. I was reciting famous poems aloud. "Pitiful are the bones by the Wu-ting River, still dreaming of spring..." Suddenly, I heard a faint wave of laughter. When I turned around, I saw that it was my orderly, Brother Chunbao. He was still sitting there, and other than his face, he was still motionless.

Now, he and I have been friends for a full six months. He knows that I am not as stern and scary as other soldiers, so he is always talking and laughing. He now knows how to pick two roses in the wild for me and put them in my vase, etc. Many strange and humorous actions that he performs, things that are beyond people's imagination, make me feel an unexpected joy. Just like yesterday, he used my cod liver oil to stir-fry eggs. Although this is inappropriate, it seems to be as thought-provoking as a novel "joke."

Soldiers all have a bit of a bad mentality of "fearing that the world won't be chaotic." This is because it is really boring to be stationed in the army. Especially in this Shanghai, where the cost of living is high and the world is full of temptations, how can the lower-level cadres who cannot strike and have no cost of living adjustments not feel depressed? Fortunately, I have a theatrical orderly, which makes my bitter heart feel new.

I am very grateful to God for creating him and making him so stupid. Otherwise, not only would he not be able to be my orderly, but I am afraid that very few people in all of China would be willing to be soldiers. Now, he has a very bad cough. According to the medical officer, he has stage two tuberculosis. I don't have the ability to send him to the hospital, so my friends are advising me to quickly "fire" him, otherwise it will affect my health. I have been thinking about this problem for three days, and finally I have made a final decision.

I want him to live and grow with me forever. I should use all that I have to provide him with medicine. This is because he is my only companion!

As I write this, he is sitting there giving me a silly smile.

This World of Mine - Han Yun

Talking about China's Greatest "Character Dismantler"

The profession of "character dismantling" experts has long been looked down upon by scholars. In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, it was already regarded as the last resort for scholars. They were like Kong Yiji, and only took up this profession to earn some money for drinking because they couldn't afford wine, dried tofu, or fried soybeans. It was a truly helpless thing.

However, there have been truly great "character dismantling" experts. Among them, there were no lack of loyal, righteous, and upright people who never forgot their homeland. Zheng Suonan (whose original name is no longer traceable), a survivor of the Song Dynasty, can be said to be the greatest of the great "character dismantling" experts. He did not help others resolve fortunes or predict the future, but focused on self-cultivation and loyalty to the country. Throughout his life, he would never sit or lie facing north, because the Song Dynasty had been destroyed by the Yuan Dynasty. He wanted to show his determination to never kneel to the enemy. His study had no decorations, only a plaque with the four characters "This World of Mine" written on it. People who saw this plaque didn't understand its meaning. If they asked him, he would mostly smile and not answer. In fact, to put it bluntly, this was precisely Mr. Zheng's skill in dismantling characters. The first character "本" (běn, root, origin) can be broken down into the characters "大" (dà, big) and "十" (shí, ten). Adding the "十" to the middle of the character "穴" (xué, cave) creates the character "宋" (sòng, Song). The so-called "This World of Mine" was originally the Southern Song world he was thinking of. His name, Suonan, also referred to this. His other name, Sixiao, was also a simple use of the character dismantling method, taking half of the character "趙" (zhào), "肖" (xiào), to express his longing for the Zhao Song Dynasty.

Zheng Suonan was not only good at "character dismantling," but he was also discovered by later generations during the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty to be a master at painting orchids. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, all the orchids he painted had exposed roots. Someone once asked him, "Why do you paint orchids with exposed roots and not paint the soil?" He replied, "Our Great Song has no territory left; it has been taken away by foreigners!"

His heart of loyalty and righteousness overflowed from his words. This is something that the likes of Kong Yiji could never achieve. Who would say it is inappropriate to call him China's greatest "character dismantling" expert?

Starving Hengyang - Feng

The rain drifting outside the window washed away the heat of the past two days. It has been two days since I arrived in Shanghai. Seeing the prosperity and song and dance of the city, I can't help but think of Hengyang, which I visited half a month ago. The prosperity of Shanghai and the disaster in Hengyang form a clear contrast in my mind. I can no longer remain silent.

Before the war, Hengyang was one of the leading commercial ports in Hunan. Apart from Changsha, Hengyang was one of the richest places. This time, due to the war, Hengyang suffered glorious wounds, lost everything it had, and fell tragically. When we arrived near the urban area of ​​Hengyang, we only saw broken walls and a desolate atmosphere that filled everyone's hearts.

In the central urban area, there is a north-south thoroughfare. The shops on both sides have all been rebuilt recently, mostly food stores, department stores, and silk shops. On both sides of the street are decorations rarely seen in other cities, that is, the disaster victims lying prostrate along the street. They all came from the surrounding villages. The green grass could no longer support them. Because they could get flour and porridge in the city, they came to the city reluctantly with the old and the young. We saw their pale faces, skinny limbs, swaying steps, and trembling hands holding an empty bowl. Or they held a pair of chopsticks in their hands, moving like wandering ghosts on both sides of the road. From time to time, they would collapse and die... The sun in June was scorching hot, and there were also occasional heavy rains. Their resistance had long been weakened, and they died silently one after another. According to the city government's statistics, about 2,000 people starve to death every day. This is only limited to the disaster victims who are wandering on the streets of the city. They don't even have the strength to shout the last "hungry"!

I personally saw a seven- or eight-year-old boy, naked, starve to death on the side of the road near the porridge distribution site and the orphanage for disaster victims. His stomach was severely concave. An old woman told me that he was still crying five minutes ago, asking for some porridge. I also personally saw a strong man whose head was as small as a child due to starvation. Only because of his disproportionately long limbs did I decide that he was starving to death. God, what a terrible disaster!

In order to learn more about the starvation situation in Hengyang, we visited families in areas about fifteen miles away from the city center. We visited the seventh district. The seventh district has a total of fourteen bao. The bao near the city had rice to eat, and those farther from the city ate rice mixed with grass. The only difference was the ratio of rice to grass in the mixture. The grasses they ate included: Xia Ku Cao, dandelion, hemp mulberry, and wormwood. I saw a girl screaming in pain because she mistakenly ate poisonous grass. Her face was red and swollen, and tears were streaming down her face. The sound tore my heart apart, and I asked myself in a low voice, whose fault is this?

The old people told me with tears in their eyes that their days were not long, and they would rather die sooner. The children told me that eating grass for a long time made their stomachs swell and their limbs weak. The farmers told me that they had good land but could not cultivate it, mainly because they did not have the strength to produce. They said, "Sir, without food, where can we find the strength to farm? We have no choice but to let it lie fallow. What can we do?" In addition, thirty or forty families share one cow, and there are also major problems with seeds. Some people who make a living by selling their labor told me, "Sir, this year, you can't even sell your strength for money!" I asked myself again in a low voice, how should this be solved?

Shanghai is affluent, at least outwardly. Foul smells, dirt, death, and starvation are foreign to Shanghai. However, the fact that there is such a disaster in the same country should attract the attention of the whole country. I hope all sectors will pay attention to disaster relief work.

A Few Words

How Much Living Expenses Should Be Left for the Families of Traitors? - Wuling Ren

An employee of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Mr. Yan, has many children. His family of eleven cannot maintain their livelihood. He sent a letter to the newspaper saying that if anyone wanted to "enjoy his later years," he was willing to let them adopt his children under the age of fifteen, and that "the children are honest and diligent, and are still able to study diligently." Reading this is heartbreaking. Offering one's own flesh and blood to others for "enjoyment in their later years" is a human tragedy that cannot be surpassed. In today's world, "honest" people suffer everywhere. Being a scholar is useless, and scholars are no longer valued. However, Mr. Yan still seems to think that his children have these two advantages that are sufficient to make them successful, hoping to attract people's attention. He is wrong!

He who is not moved by reading the "Chu Shi Biao" must be disloyal, and he who is not moved by reading the "Chen Qing Biao" must be unfilial. Then, is he who is unmoved by reading the "Memorial by Censor Cheng on the Misconduct of Grain Officials" also a corrupt person?

The Three Tigers of Guangzhou are causing trouble. If you don't believe it, look at the news: (1) Cholera was rampant for a while, with an average of more than 50 cases occurring every day; (2) The number of refugees and beggars dying of starvation on the streets is increasing day by day, and the burial team is "overwhelmed" (hoarding is rampant, and the price of rice is high, which is one of the reasons); (3) The number of car accidents has broken all previous records. The "epidemic tiger," the "market tiger," and the "hoarding tiger" are so terrible! Shanghai also has these three tigers causing trouble, and their rampancy is no less than that in Guangzhou. The authorities have measures to eliminate, catch, and prevent tigers. I only hope that they will not do things half-heartedly. Then, even if the tigers are fierce, they will not be able to use their skills, so that the people will no longer turn pale at the mention of tigers. What good fortune that would be!

Regarding the property of the traitors who have been sentenced, there are no clear legal provisions on how much living expenses should be left for their families. How much should be left and what is the standard? People in the legal field have been discussing this recently. According to Mr. Yang Litang, chief clerk of the Jiangsu High Court, the standard for leaving a portion should depend on the total amount of property, the number of family members, and the price level (excluding family members who can support themselves). His words are not only empty and difficult to handle, but one thing seems to have been determined, that is, the descendants of traitors who are able to support themselves should no longer be given property as necessary living expenses for their families. Is it yes or no?

Spring and Autumn: Right and Wrong - Fu Tongxian

Is there really right and wrong in this human world? This is a very troublesome philosophical question. According to the ancient Greek sophists, "There is no objective truth in the world, but everyone has his own truth." Zhuangzi's theory of equality of things also develops this idea. He said, "This is also that, and that is also this. That is also one right and wrong, and this is also one right and wrong. Is there really a that and this? Is there really no that and this?" He believed that "this" is "that," and that is "this." This is entirely a matter of different positions when people speak. If I stand in the position of "Fu Mou" to speak to Li Mou, then Fu Mou is "I" and Zhang Mou is called "he." If I stand in the position of "Zhang Mou" to speak to Li Mou, then Zhang Mou is "I" and Fu Mou is called "he." So Fu Mou is "I" in Fu Mou's eyes, and "he" in Zhang Mou's eyes. Similarly, Zhang Mou is "I" and also "he." So he also said: "One side can be right, and the other side cannot be right; one side cannot be right, and the other side can be right; because it is right, because it is wrong; because it is wrong, because it is right." The meaning is that from one side, it is "possible," but from the other side, it is "impossible." From one side, it is "impossible," but from the other side, it is "possible." This thinks it is right, that thinks it is wrong; that thinks it is wrong, this thinks it is right. In short, right and wrong are due to different subjective positions, and there is no objective standard.

We agree with Zhuangzi on two points: (1) Behavior itself has no right or wrong; (2) Right and wrong are not absolute, but relative. But we believe that right and wrong are not subjective judgments, but have an objective standard.

First, we say that behavior itself has no right or wrong. For example, I eat when I am hungry, sing when I feel uncomfortable, and try to escape when I encounter a dangerous situation. These behaviors have no right or wrong. Because we believe that morality originates from human social activities, that is to say, a person does not have innate right and wrong moral concepts, nor are there innate right or wrong behaviors. Right and wrong behaviors are produced from the relationships between people.

Second, we acknowledge that right and wrong are relative rather than absolute. But we oppose Zhuangzi's relativizing right and wrong to individual will, and we oppose the Greek sophists' subjective relativism of "the individual as the measure of all things." We advocate objective relativism. Because we believe that right and wrong concepts are related to the entire social relationship. Human behavior has no right or wrong if it is separated from the entire social relationship. Social relationships are also not fixed. Social relationships are the result of long-term evolution, and at the same time, they are constantly advancing. Thus, right and wrong concepts also evolve with social evolution. Social relationships also vary from region to region, so different places also have different right and wrong concepts. Therefore, right and wrong concepts are relative to a specific spatial and temporal social relationship. But does this mean that there are always many different right and wrong systems in this world? This question depends on the overall trend of social progress. From the perspective of the evolution of social organization, the regionality of social relations is gradually disappearing. In primitive times, individual behavior was limited to tribes, then evolved into feudal separatism, and then into a unified country. The expansion of social relations and the strictness of social organization show the unification of the right and wrong system.

Third, based on the above analysis, we know that the judgment of right and wrong is not based on a subjective position, but has its own objective standard. This objective standard is the gradually evolving social relationship that is tending towards completeness and rigor. Regarding the origin of right and wrong concepts, I may still quote a passage from Zhuangzi and then explain it. Zhuangzi said: "It can be done, it can be done; it cannot be done, it cannot be done. The way is formed by practice, and things are so named by saying." This word "可" (kě, can, may) is interpreted by Mr. Feng Youlan as "Possibility" (see his English translation of Zhuangzi). I interpret it as "can do". A child asks her mother, "Auntie gave me a piece of candy, can I take it?" The mother says, "Yes!" The child asks, "Can I take other people's money at will?" The mother says, "No!" I think this word "可" has a moral meaning. "What is called can do? What is called cannot do?" Zhuangzi thought this was the opinion of many people. Everyone says "can do," then this thing can be done; everyone says "cannot do," then this thing cannot be done. It's like a road in the countryside, which originally didn't exist, but later everyone walked on the same line, and over time it became a road. This thing originally had no name, but later everyone called it "dog," and now it is a dog. So Zhuangzi said: "The way is formed by practice, and things are so named by saying." This shows that Zhuangzi himself also admitted that right and wrong are based on everyone's opinion as the standard.

We can further ask: "Why do we all walk on this road and not another road in a wilderness? Can I personally be innovative and open up another path?" The answer is simple, because this route is the shortest from our village to that town. Similarly, in society, why do we say, "This thing can be done, but that thing cannot be done?" That is because this thing is beneficial to everyone, and that thing is harmful to everyone. So the production of right and wrong originally stems from the common interests of many people. Everything that promotes the common welfare is right, and everything that damages the common welfare is wrong. Therefore, we can specifically say that the concept of right and wrong is built on the common interests of the entire society. The medium that concretely represents the common welfare in society is the social system, because based on the intelligence, experience, and environment of the people of an era, this social system is most sufficient to represent the common welfare. Moral judgment is also based on this social system as the standard.

Based on this standard, the judgment of right and wrong is very clear. Right is right, and wrong is not right. When the two sides have a dispute about right and wrong, there are only four possibilities: (1) Both sides are right, but this is impossible, because since both sides use the common welfare as the standard, then they should have no room for dispute; (2) A is right and B is wrong, then this must be that A promotes the common welfare and B damages the common welfare; (3) B is right and A is wrong, the reason is the same; (4) Both A and B are wrong, this is because both sides only care about part of the welfare and have not considered the common welfare of the entire society. Now there is a kind of people who claim to be fair. When they see a dispute between the two sides, they do not ask about the right and wrong of the two sides, but only seek to stop the dispute between the two sides. In our opinion, truly fair people should return right to him who is right, and return wrong to him who is wrong; if both sides are wrong, they should point out the mistakes of both sides and put the real common welfare in front. We must fully support the right side and hinder the wrong side, or start from the premise of the common welfare and fight against the wrong of both sides with all our strength, striving to win the truth and eliminate selfish intentions. Otherwise, if right and wrong are not distinguished and black and white are not clear, society will continue to be so chaotic! We believe this is not the blessing of the whole society.

As for whether a certain social system truly represents the common welfare, this is a question, because in a certain era, people are limited by intelligence and experience, or due to the prejudices of a minority class, a kind of unreasonable system is produced, which is not sufficient to represent the welfare of all the people, and this needs to be thoroughly reformed to make it rational. We are prepared to bring this up for special discussion when there is an opportunity in the future.

To the Star - Zhang Che

"Niaz"

This means "star"

You, the singer whose name means "star"

Oh,

In your song that I can't understand,

You sang

A spirit as sweet and fragrant as the spring water in the Gobi Desert

Like a spring of clear stars

Like stars of clear

Your blue eyes, oh

Flickering in the sunken eye sockets

Flickering under the thick eyebrows

Are you looking out at

The sunset………

The rice paddies………

The chirping of insects………

Every drop of water contains the vitality of life

A summer evening

You stand on a green knoll

Are you missing

Your hometown

Xinjiang, which you left at the tender age of eleven

Wandering in all directions

No parents

The fate of your parents is unknown

No hometown

You can't go back to your hometown

No good education, no good support

You grow like a weed

And under the care of the star

That shares your name

You grow

Very strong

Even though you don't know

How to sing scales

You don't understand what

The meaning of the two words "rhythm" is

But with your

Primitive musical sensitivity

Singing

Dancing

Those poems that praise your own homeland

In your own language

Making us amazed at

Your genius

Young singer, oh………

And in your singing

In the waving of your arms

In the rise and fall of your eyebrows

In the language of your blue eyes

Unfolding

Xinjiang's

Eternally unmelted

White-headed snow mountains and oceans of thousands of miles of desert

And the oases within

And the incomparably sweet Hami melons

And the amethyst-like grapes of Turpan

That is beautiful land

I heard that you fell in love with a

Mongolian girl whose name is "Moon"

May you expand this love

To all the brothers of the

Chinese nation with different names

--Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan………

Like "stars" and "moon"

The era of loving each other

Then you can go back

Then you can go back, oh

1942.8.22. at Nanquan;

1946.6.2. Re-recorded old work.

(Note) This poem was written to Muhammad Niaz, who was displaced from Xinjiang due to the past internal strife; Muhammad is a surname, and has been changed to Mai after entering the mainland. Niaz means stars in the Uyghur language.

Filial Piety - Qin

My younger sister sent 30,000 legal tender from faraway Kunming, saying that it was her private money accumulated day by day, especially for her mother's pocket money, because her brother-in-law's income was not very good, so don't let him know.

When I heard this news, I couldn't help but burst into tears.

I remember eight years ago, my brother-in-law was an internist in a hospital in Suzhou, with a monthly salary of seventy yuan. Twenty-five yuan was sent to his parents, and he, my sister, and a child lived in the hospital's doctor's dormitory. Rent and utilities were provided by the hospital, and the remaining forty-five yuan was used to maintain the life of a family of three.

My health was not good, and I needed to inject medication for a long time. For convenience, I lived in my sister's house for the whole summer vacation.

The hospital had coolies to clean the house every day. For the sake of me, an ignorant guest, they had to constantly call for tea and water. My sister paid a maid three yuan a month. Although rice was cheap at that time, it still cost six or seven yuan a month. It was either chicken and fish, or duck and meat. There were also two snacks in the morning and afternoon, and fruit after meals. The side dishes, fruits, and noodles cost about one yuan a day. On holidays, she would accompany me to visit Tiger Hill and watch movies. In this way, my brother-in-law's monthly salary was not enough to cover expenses.

### High Court Tries Traitors, Sets New Record: Verdict to be Announced This Month on the 21st in the Afternoon; Liang Hongzhi Case Concludes After Five Hours of Trial; Prosecutor Supplements Evidence of Defendant's Crimes; Court Summons Witness Xue Dake for Confrontation; Pleads for Leniency Based on a Poem in the Seven-Character Regulated Verse Form

[Report from this newspaper] Liang Hongzhi, who was the first in the Southeast region to betray his country and surrender to the enemy, organize a puppet regime, raise the five-colored flag, establish the so-called Reformed Government, rule the occupied areas on behalf of the enemy, and assist them in their wrongdoing, had his trial concluded yesterday afternoon. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 2:30 PM on the 21st of this month.

Judge Liu, along with Associate Judges Cao and Qiu, as well as Prosecutor Dai and the court clerk, took their seats at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. A court attendant presented files related to Liang, which were over a foot high. Prosecutor Dai began by standing and supplementing the facts of the defendant's crimes committed during his tenure in puppet positions, as well as the supporting documents, which were divided into three categories: (1) those during his tenure in the "Reformed Government"; (2) those during his tenure in the "United Committee of the Government of China"; and (3) those after joining the puppet National Government. These included various important documents, such as the "Commemorative Album of the First Anniversary of the Reformed Government," the outline of the "Anti-Communist and National Salvation Representative Conference Plan" of the puppet Ministry of Interior, the anniversary declaration of the "China"-Japan Treaty, the declaration of the Anti-Communist and National Salvation People's Congress, the proposals of Chu Qinglai of the puppet Ministry of Communications regarding "China"-Japan joint ventures, and the "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Reconstruction Literature." After Judge Liu reviewed them, he handed them over to Liang for detailed reading. Except for some attempts to shift responsibility, he admitted that they were correct. Then, Judge Liu asked Liang if he had any further statements to make. Liang stated: "The first reason I organized the Reformed Government was to preserve the nation's vitality, and the second was to reduce the suffering of the people. I was not willingly surrendering to the enemy or opposing the central government. My visit to Japan was merely a courtesy reply and I did not conclude any diplomatic agreements. As for Wang Zhaoming's '　telegram,' I did not know the central government's intention and thought it was a dual approach, so I neither opposed nor agreed. In the early spring of the 29th year, Vice President Kong of the central government sent representative Xue Dake to Shanghai to discuss supplying firewood to the central government. Therefore, I entrusted Xue to forward a telegram to express my feelings. Subsequently, Judge Liu summoned witness Xue Dake. According to Xue's testimony, he came to Shanghai in March of the 29th year of the Republic to engage in divisive work within the puppet regime. Liang entrusted him to send a long telegram, the gist of which was to express his willingness to join the puppet regime to alleviate the suffering of the people, without any intention of resisting the central government, and he received a reply stating that he should remain in the puppet regime for the time being. In the 33rd year, Liang rescued Dong Renji, the former dean of the Law School of Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping, and Mo Qianli, the current Director of the Education Bureau in Beiping, from prison. Both of them had been sentenced to 15 years by the puppet court and were released on bail by Liang." At this point, Judge Liu, at the request of the prosecutor, ordered Xue to temporarily leave and then questioned Liang, saying, "When did you rescue the underground workers?" Liang replied, "In the spring of the 34th year." The judge asked, "Where was Dong Renji detained at the time?" Liang replied, "He was detained in the Beiping Gendarmerie." The judge asked, "How did you bail him out?" Liang replied, "I asked Okada to call the Japanese Embassy in Beiping from Nanjing." The judge asked, "What was their response?" Liang replied, "There was no response." The judge asked, "When did Xue Dake come?" Liang replied, "In February or March of the 29th year, on the orders of the Vice President of the Executive Yuan to come to Shanghai." The judge asked, "Where did you talk with him?" Liang replied, "In the puppet Executive Yuan." The judge asked, "What was your relationship with Xue?" Liang replied, "There was no relationship." Then, Xue Dake was summoned again to compare his testimony. Only the address of the meeting was accurate. Xue initially said it was the Legislative Yuan, but later said it was the Control Yuan. Liang added, "During the era of the puppet Reformed Government, the Japanese strongly wanted Liang to form a Political Security Bureau and a Food Control Bureau, but these did not materialize, which was beneficial to the people. Moreover, in the 27th and 28th years, I never killed a single patriot or defrauded a single good civilian. As a mere scholar, I argued with the invaders and made a small contribution to the war of resistance. I never intended to resist my own country." After he finished speaking, Judge Liu announced the start of the debate. Prosecutor Dai began by standing and arguing that Liang was a politician from the warlord era and a pro-Japanese member of the Anfu clique. Taking advantage of the retreat of the national army to the west, he alone stood up and organized the "Reformed Government" to oppose the central government. His act of conspiring with the enemy was obvious. The defendant's claim that he did not establish special agents and grain control agencies, thus benefiting the people, was also inaccurate, as benefiting the people requires positive actions. Subsequently, he made numerous arguments regarding the crimes committed during his tenure in puppet positions. Then, lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Zhu Hongru, and Li Guozhen defended the defendant in order. Lawyer Zhang stated: "The defendant (1) is not a member of the Kuomintang and is different from those who betray the country and the party; (2) from beginning to end, he had no intention or sign of confronting the country; (3) he surrendered earliest. In the late stage of the war of resistance, he jointly defended against bandits with Ren Yuandao and resisted rebellious troops; (4) he committed no misgovernment during his tenure in the puppet government." Lawyer Zhu stated: "The Anfu clique never existed. Its leader, Duke Duan, repeatedly advocated for the republic and contributed to the Republic of China. He was by no means a pro-Japanese faction. In prosecuting traitors today, we should not ask whether they were in a puppet government or not, but only whether they were traitors or not. During the 'Reformed' era, the defendant cherished his homeland and criticized the Japanese invaders. He wrote a seven-character regulated verse: 'I put down my books and wine cup, and the beautiful days rush away, never to return. I feel like a spring orchid bound in layers, and my heart is like a silkworm moth, inch by inch turned to ashes. The swords and bows under the steps are like children's games, and how many talents are in the limited banners? Whipping the six kingdoms is a common thing, it's a pity the people of Qin do not lament for themselves.' His love for the country and deep resentment towards the enemy are evident in the words, so please consider the circumstances of the case and impose a lenient sentence." Lawyer Li emphasized Liang's contributions. But Liang finally said, "I don't need to show my achievements, but my heart must be shown." By this time, it was 8:05 PM, and Judge Liu announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 21st. Yesterday's trial of the Liang case lasted five hours, setting a new record for the High Court's trial of traitors. After leaving the courtroom, the night was dim, and Liang still met with his family. At that time, Liang was wearing a gray hemp long jacket, blue silk pants, and black leather shoes. He held a white bamboo folding fan and carried a pair of old glasses. He was hunched over, his hair was white, and he looked very old. His wife's face was covered in makeup, and she looked much younger compared to Liang. After exchanging greetings, Liang was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

### Zhao Zhentang

[Report from this newspaper] Zhao Zhentang from Dongtai, the puppet Vice Minister of Judicial Administration, also served as the Chief Judge of the puppet Shanghai High Court and the President of the puppet Shanghai District Court. He was tried by Judge Feng yesterday morning. According to his statement: his house was destroyed by enemy fire, his life was impoverished and difficult to live, and he witnessed that the people in the occupied areas had no judicial protection, and their lives and property were greatly destroyed. Therefore, his assumption of puppet positions was to protect the lives and property of the people with the spirit of the rule of law. The court discussion was adjourned for further questioning and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Zhao Zunyue

In addition, the High Court yesterday brought Zhao Zunyue, who had served as the puppet Minister of Propaganda and other positions, for trial. Zhao is from Changzhou and is forty-nine years old. According to his statement: "After the government retreated to the west, the people were unable to fully evacuate. The 30 million people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were under enemy oppression, living in dire straits. Their suffering can be imagined. After Wang Zhaoming came to Shanghai, he invited me to talk, because I was quite familiar with Shanghai and worked in the press, so I was quite familiar with Wang. The result of the discussion was that in the process of winning the War of Resistance, we must save these people who are in hell. We should seek benefits for the people, regardless of merit or demerit. On the principle of not violating the War of Resistance, I took office in puppet positions and participated in peace talks." He also denied each point regarding the implementation of harsh taxes, the promotion of enslaving education, and the control of the press. Subsequently, the defense lawyer stated that Zhao had protected the work of secret radio stations during his tenure in puppet positions and requested the court to summon witnesses Wang Yaoqin, Lu Yiming, and Robin, as Robin had introduced him to Liu Baichuan, and Zhao established a radio station to communicate with the central government. After detailed questioning, the court discussion was adjourned for further questioning.

[Another report] Li Wenbin, the puppet Vice Minister of Interior and "National Government" Political Affairs Advisor, his son Li Zhenyu (clerk of the puppet Ministry of Interior), and Su Dehuai, the puppet army commander, were also interrogated and adjourned for further questioning.
