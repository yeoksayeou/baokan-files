### Marshall and Stuart Leighton Jointly Visit Chairman Chiang, Seeking to Open the Door to Peace; The U.S. is Watching the Development of Marshall's Mediation

[United Press Agency, Nanjing, 13th] U.S. Special Envoy to China General Marshall and U.S. Ambassador to China Stuart Leighton jointly visited Chairman Chiang at 5:00 PM on the 13th to make a final effort for the dying peace talks. This meeting is extremely important, but the outcome is currently unknown. Before visiting Chairman Chiang, Marshall and Stuart Leighton held talks for two hours this morning. Well-informed sources here believe that although mediators continue to work hard, all hope for resolving the KMT-CPC issue has effectively disappeared. Meanwhile, Communist Party representatives Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan stayed at home all day today. According to Communist Party sources, the official response from the Communist Party is being drafted in Shanghai by Zhou Enlai based on instructions from Yan'an and is expected to be delivered to Nanjing in the next day or two.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Special Envoy Marshall went to the embassy to meet with Ambassador Stuart at 10:00 AM on the 13th, leaving around 12:00 PM. The ambassador visited Special Envoy Marshall again at 8:00 PM in the afternoon. It is reported that the two mediators are still willing to make the greatest effort to facilitate a turnaround in the precarious situation that is about to collapse. They firmly believe that the KMT-CPC dispute, although seemingly military, is actually political. Therefore, the war should not affect political negotiations. It is heard that the two will still seek a way to resolve the military issue through political means. However, Marshall and Stuart Leighton may remain silent for a day or two and not express any opinions for the time being.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] A certain newspaper reported that Marshall and Stuart Leighton are expected to issue a third joint statement soon.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The White House and the U.S. State Department are closely monitoring developments related to Marshal Marshall's mission.

Political Consultative Conference Representatives Discuss National Assembly List with Sun Ke

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] After the Communist Party issued a stubborn statement on the 13th, people in the capital, observing the current situation, pinned their hopes on President Sun Ke's return to Nanjing. Sun arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. After resting for less than half an hour, Political Consultative Conference representatives Wu Dingchang, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, Lei Zhen, etc., went to Sun's residence to discuss the issue of various parties participating in the National Assembly. Sun reported on his contacts with various parties in Shanghai, and expressed the hope that they would come to Nanjing. It is reported that those present exchanged opinions for a long time and agreed that the government would leave the greatest leeway in procedures and formalities for the proposal of the National Assembly list by various parties and would further study the suggestions made by the Democratic League. It is said that a new decision has been reached and was submitted to the Chairman in the evening. Also, Li Huang of the Youth Party flew to Shanghai by plane at 12:00 AM. Liang Shuming of the Democratic League visited Li this morning for a meeting. Liang told reporters that he did not want to say much, only that everything would be studied and decided by the representatives staying in Shanghai. In other news, although people from the Democratic League in Shanghai have temporarily suspended their trip to Nanjing due to the changing situation, it is said that their overall attitude is also inconsistent. Some cautious people are quietly observing the changes, and there may be new expressions in the coming days.

### The National Assembly Will Proceed as Scheduled Even if Various Parties Do Not Participate

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Although the CPC and the Democratic League denounced the government's order to convene the National Assembly as scheduled, saying that it intended to shatter all hopes for a peaceful resolution of the KMT-CPC issue, the government is actively preparing, arranging the venue, and receiving the National Assembly representatives, with all employees working day and night. According to the National Assembly spokesperson's conversation with our agency's reporter, regarding the number of representatives, the total number of representatives is 2,050, of which 1,560 have already been elected or appointed. The government still needs to designate 74 people as representatives. Even if the various parties do not participate, the National Assembly will still proceed as scheduled. Generally speaking, the Youth Party and representatives from various parties will attend, even if the CPC and the Democratic League do not.

[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited Chen Qitian, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters of the Chinese Youth Party on Huashan Road, and asked for his opinion on the future of peace in China. He replied as follows: The future of peace in China has not yet reached a state of complete despair. As long as everyone continues to work hard, it will not be difficult to promote peace. Now is a critical time. I hope that all parties will quickly engage in consultations to save the crisis of peace. The Youth Party's desire for peace has never dared to lag behind others, and it will follow the people of the country and continue to work hard to promote peace.

The Outskirts of Shijiazhuang Suddenly Tense

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The war situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is about to change. The National Army has transferred the remaining forces to drive away the Communist Army, which has been showing off for half a month.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 13th] The outskirts of Shijiazhuang are suddenly tense. The Communist Army is massively concentrating forces along the Tuotuo River and northwest of Shijiazhuang.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 12th] There may not be any military actions north of Changchun this year. A certain military observer told reporters: The National Army is currently in a state of peace in northern Northeast China, but if the Communist Army does carry out harassment actions, the National Army has the strength to give it a serious blow. As for the issue of repairing the Songjiang Weiqiao bridge, the Communist side strongly disagrees, believing that the repair of the bridge poses a fatal threat to the Communist Army's strongholds north of Songhua. In fact, this view is purely a psychological disturbance of the Communist Army's own insecurity.

He deeply hopes that the Communist Army can realize its mistakes in time and stop its harassment attempts to prevent the people of Northeast China from suffering war again after the disaster. Otherwise, he will, as his duty dictates, supervise his subordinates, defend the territory, and protect the people, and the Communist Army will be responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.

### Huailai and Xuanhua Have Been Recaptured; The National Armies of Sun and Fu Will Soon Join Forces; Yan'an Formally Admits to Withdrawing from Zhangjiakou

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The Huailai front, which had been fought fiercely for more than ten days, was finally completely defeated by the National Army at 2:00 AM on the 13th. The remnants of the Communist Army retreated to Yuxian in more than 200 cars. Huailai was officially recaptured. The National Army passing through the front of Huailai has now connected with the troops that bypassed Huailai earlier and recaptured Xiahuayuan. There is currently no frontal resistance from the Communist Army from the eastern section of the PingSui Railway to Xiahuayuan. The National Army in that area can join forces with Fu Zuoyi's troops, who recaptured Xuanhua yesterday afternoon, and connect the PingSui line east of Zhangjiakou. As for the war in Chahar Province, except for the unknown details of the Chaigoubao area, the Communist Army has almost completely lost its will to fight. According to reports, the battle of Huailai was extremely fierce, and both armies suffered heavy losses. The Communist Army dug ditches several feet wide and deep to prevent tanks, and the air defense works were also very strong. The Communist Army placed a large number of mines in important retreat locations. Therefore, the military specially trained mine-sweeping teams to assist the transportation authorities in repairing the railway.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] After the National Army recaptured Zhangjiakou, it continued to divide its troops into two routes. One route went east and entered Xuanhua at 5:30 PM on the 12th. This unit can join forces with the 11th War Zone Commander Sun Lianzhong's troops, who recaptured Xiahuayuan, in Xinzhuangzi between them within days. The troops advancing westward have reached Chaigoubao. The remnants of the Communist Army in Chahar Province have lost their will to fight.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Reliable news, after the National Army Fu Zuoyi's troops recaptured Zhangjiakou, one side deployed city defenses and reorganized the city. The other side quickly went south. The city of Xuanhua was recaptured by Sun Bingfeng's troops at 5:00 PM on the evening of the 12th and will soon join forces with the 11th War Zone troops, who broke through the Communist Army's defense line in Huailai after a bloody battle, in Xiahuayuan according to the original plan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Mei Yi, a spokesperson for the CPC delegation, officially stated at noon on the 13th that the Communist Army voluntarily withdrew from Zhangjiakou on the afternoon of the 11th.

### Chairman Chiang Allocates Funds to Reward the Troops; Chief of Staff Chen Cheng Meets with Fu, Li, etc. to Discuss

[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 13th] Chairman Chiang allocated 500 million yuan to reward the National Army that recaptured Zhangjiakou.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] After hearing the good news early in the morning of the 13th that the Communist Army on the Huailai front was completely defeated, Chief of Staff Chen went to the Beiping Pacification Headquarters in the morning to meet with Li Zongren and others.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng flew back to Gui Sui on the 12th, comforted Commander Fu, and returned to Beiping at 6:00 PM that evening.

[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 12th] Chen Cheng flew to Zhangjiakou to inspect the area above on the morning of the 12th and arrived in Sui at 12:00 PM to discuss with Commander Fu. He commented on this matter as follows: The evacuation of Zhangjiakou is of course a loss to the people, but from a realistic military point of view, it has not caused difficulties for the people. The key to deciding the current Chinese civil war is not the temporary gains and losses of a few cities, but the ebb and flow of military strength between the two sides. When we started the ten-year civil war, we did not have a single city, and at the beginning of the eight-year war of resistance, there was not a single county town in the secret border area of Shaanxi and Gansu, and we could still annihilate the enemy's forces and achieve victory; then today, in the liberated area with 400 million people, what's wrong with temporarily withdrawing from some cities and towns in exchange for the conditions to annihilate the enemy's forces? In the future, the people of the liberated areas will be relieved of their illusions about peace and the burden of defending the city of Zhangjiakou. Afterwards, their military strength will become stronger and stronger, and their use of troops will become more mobile. The Kuomintang's difficulties will increase, its weaknesses will become greater, its front lines will become longer, and its supplies will be more difficult to maintain. Although it can still occupy some cities, the military and civilians of the liberated areas will be more united and launch resistance. When its power is annihilated to a certain extent, it will definitely be able to completely crush its offensive and recover Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Jining, Huaiyin, and all lost territories.

### Zhangbei Airport Repaired

### The Commander of the Beiping Garrison Changes

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Chen Jicheng, Deputy Commander of the 11th War Zone, succeeded Hou Lingru, Commander of the 92nd Army, as Commander of the Beiping Garrison.

### Chinese and Foreign Journalists in Beiping Contacted to Visit Zhangjiakou

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] In order to inspect Zhangjiakou after the war, Chinese and foreign journalists here have asked the Beiping Pacification Headquarters to negotiate for transportation.

### Feng Qinzai Will Go to Huailai to Preside Over the Demobilization Affairs of Chahar Province; Gu Zhenggang Will Enter Chahar to Handle Emergency Relief

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Chahar Chairman Feng Qinzai is scheduled to leave Beiping for Huailai on the morning of the 14th to preside over the demobilization of Chahar Province.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Chahar Chairman Feng Qinzai has ordered the Provincial Security Corps stationed in other places to return to the province immediately to cooperate with the National Army in pacifying the local area, and ordered the underground security corps lurking in various counties in the province to rise up and restore the county towns. It is said that Huai'an was recovered by these security corps.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The war in Chahar Province is about to end, and post-war reconstruction will follow. Although the Chahar Provincial Government has sent personnel to follow the army, it remains to be seriously considered whether it can immediately launch effective post-war reconstruction work without repeating the precedents of other recovered areas in an environment of lack of both personnel and funds. Provincial Chairman Feng Qinzai told reporters yesterday that he had repeatedly telegraphed Commander Fu Zuoyi to inquire about the current situation in Chahar Province. The Central Government has approved the allocation of 500 million yuan by the United Relief Association, which Minister Gu Zhenggang will personally bring to Chahar to handle emergency relief. However, after thorough destruction, the amount of 500 million yuan seems unable to achieve much effect. Another famous Chahar person who fled to Beiping said: He is worried about the local order after the passage of the troops. For example, in some counties in eastern Hebei, after the large army recovered the strongholds, it was handed over to ineffective local teams to maintain security. Not only could they not control the situation, but they might even lose what they had regained. When the armed people could withdraw, the common people would suffer. Therefore, he will consider the issue of returning home. Conversely, the revenge tendencies of the armed return teams must also be anticipated, and textbooks are still not prepared.

### Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in China, India, and Burma, General Stilwell, Dies of Illness; Chairman Chiang Sends a Special Telegram to Mrs. Stilwell to Express Condolences

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 12th, United Press Agency] Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in the China-Burma-India Theater, General Stilwell (Gangjian), has died of liver disease in a hospital here at the age of 63. He was currently the commander of the Sixth Army. He was admitted to the hospital on September 28 to check his liver. Five days later, army doctors performed surgery. The condition was better, but it suddenly deteriorated on the 9th of this month, his physical strength weakened day by day, and he finally died at 3:48 PM on the 12th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram to express condolences upon learning of General Stilwell's death in the United States. The original text is as follows: "To Mrs. Stilwell, I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of General Stilwell. I also understand that the General's illness was caused by leading Chinese and other allied forces side by side in India and Burma. The General's death is not only mourned by my wife and I, but is also a loss to the entire Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek."

### Mourning Stilwell

— Our Newspaper Editorial Department

No Regrets in Death

"If I can prove that Chinese soldiers are as good as soldiers from any allied country, I will have no regrets in death."

This is what General Stilwell said to reporters when he began training Chinese troops in India. Now that General Stilwell has died of illness in the United States, and the bad news has spread, the military and civilians of our country will inevitably mourn the death of this great general who made great contributions. But General Shi has no regrets, because Chinese soldiers have been proven to be as brave and good at fighting as any soldiers in the world.

Stilwell arrived in China on March 3, 1942, and was responsible for planning and commanding the Burma campaign. He had served in China for twenty years of his life. He was familiar with Chinese, Japanese, and also familiar with the capabilities and needs of the Chinese troops. In two years and eight months, the Burma campaign turned from defense to offense, which is the main part of his achievement.

Translated and compiled by our newspaper

Stilwell is every soldier's uncle and old man, he is the father of his army. When he passed by the battlefield hospital, he always stopped to greet the wounded soldiers in Chinese. He often lived with American and Chinese soldiers, ate their pickled vegetables, and chatted casually. He suddenly appeared everywhere in the jungle.

In the spring of 1942, the Japanese army succeeded in Burma, and the Allied forces were driven out. General Stilwell was determined to avenge his humiliation at this time. He served as the commander of the U.S. Army in the China-India-Burma theater. At that time, he had a plan to open a new supply route to China. At the same time, he wanted to establish some training centers in India, where American personnel would train a new modern Chinese army.

The Plan is Realized

His plan began to be realized in October 1942. Many British and American officers thought this was impossible. They pointed out that Stilwell's actions were just a political performance to increase the morale of the Chinese army; but facts proved that Stilwell was not a politician, he was a very practical person.

When the India training center was first established, it used the Chinese troops who had retreated from Burma under the command of Generals Sun Liren and Liao Yaoxiang as the core, and later gradually expanded. A year later, a division of Chinese troops trained by the United States, carrying the latest American weapons, left the training center in India and went to the front line. One and a half years after the fall of Burma, the offensive of the Chinese army began. This was the first real offensive action by China in its six years of war against Japan.

General Stilwell often went to the front line in person. This great spirit of selflessness has won the respect and respect of Chinese soldiers for him. Under his leadership, two divisions of Chinese troops occupied more than 1,000 square miles of territory occupied by the Japanese Kou, killing more than 7,000 Japanese Kou, and penetrating into the Japanese-occupied areas. This is something that no Allied force in the Asian continent has been able to do since the outbreak of the Far East War.

Heroic Story

To describe Stilwell's achievements and personality, we should trace back to a story about him in Burma.

During the battle of Hukang, Stilwell once discovered that a battalion of Chinese troops was lost and searching for a way in the mountains and jungles west of the Hukang Valley.

They ran into the Japanese army's crisscrossing trail network and occupied a small clearing, believing that this clearing was their target. Stilwell, along with a distressed Chinese division commander, two American liaison officers, and a few guards, went to find this lost battalion of people. He also carried his famous "little axe." The solemn look in his eyes indicated that he was going to use his "little axe."

Using a compass, he led his anxious group across the mountains along jungle trails that had been trampled out or cut by the Kachin people. The Chinese troops who had passed through this area a few days ago were only a few hundred yards away from a company of Japanese troops, and they didn't even know that there were Japanese troops there. But Japanese snipers and ambushers did not discover this old man (referring to Stilwell) disturbing them. He was very anxious. Late in the evening, they found the lost battalion of people. Stilwell, with the consent of the division commander, replaced the battalion commander to let them rest, and pointed out to the new battalion commander how to reach his target. Then Stilwell went to sleep in a bomb shelter. The next morning, this battalion of Chinese troops moved in the right direction, and Stilwell returned to the division headquarters.

Life Deeds

Stilwell graduated from West Point Military Academy in 1904 and served in the U.S. garrison in the Philippines; from 1917 to 1918, he participated in the European War; in 1920, 23 he studied at the North China Language School in Beiping; from 1926 to 1929, he served in the 15th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army stationed in Tianjin; from 1929 to 1933, he served as the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in China; from 1942 to 1944, he served as the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in the China-India-Burma Theater and also served as the Chief of Staff of the Chairman.

Stilwell has received countless medals, the most important of which are the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Merit, but his favorite to receive was the Combat Infantry Badge. In order to fulfill his wish, U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson presented him with this medal 24 hours before his death.

General Stilwell died at the age of 63. At the time of his death, his position was the commander of the U.S. Sixth Army.

### National Army in Northern Jiangsu Recovers Linze; Advances Rapidly Towards Xinghua, Dongtai, and Lianshui; Communist Army in Southern Shandong Cornered, Major Battle Imminent

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Thirteenth] The National Army at Jieshou recovered Linze at 7:00 AM yesterday, and is victoriously advancing towards Xinghua.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Thirteenth] Military News: The Communist forces in Xinghua and Dongtai are on the verge of collapse and will soon retreat. The National Army has separately pressed close to the outskirts.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian, Thirteenth] Confirmed information states that Xinghua can be recovered within ten days. The local Home Return Corps is actively preparing to enter the city. The war situation in Dongtai is brewing. It is reported that the recovery of Dongtai will be earlier than that of Xinghua. The Home Return Corps is scheduled to advance eastward from Taixian on the 14th.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian, Thirteenth] Near Fanchuan and Xiaoji, the Communist army launched a sneak attack on our military supply line, which was repelled by the National Army, and the Communist forces have been routed.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian, Thirteenth] The Communist government of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, in light of the changing situation in northern Jiangsu, has specially designated the five counties under the jurisdiction of the First Administrative Region—Rugao, Nantong, Qidong, Haimen, and Chongming—as the Ninth Commissioner's Office, appointing Liang Lingguang as the commissioner. The First Administrative Commissioner has been replaced by Zhu Hai'ao, who also serves as the Director of Education. The deputy commissioner is Dong Shangbai, former county magistrate of Dongtai, who also serves as the Director of Civil Affairs. Ji Kai serves as the Director of Construction, and Liu Hegeng serves as the Director of Finance and Food.

[Special Dispatch from Taixian, Thirteenth] After the reorganization of the Communist administration in the northern Chuzi region, the county magistrates of various counties have been reassigned as follows: Lu San, county magistrate of Rugao; Liu Hao, county magistrate of Jingjiang, and Xue Guangle, deputy county magistrate; Wu Ming, county magistrate of Taixian, and Zuo Kaiyun, deputy county magistrate; Zhu Jianming, county magistrate of Chaishi; He Huan, county magistrate of Dongtai, and Lu Wenbin, deputy county magistrate.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, Thirteenth] Chief of Staff Li of the Xuzhou Pacification Command stated: For the past two months, the Communist forces in Jiangsu and Shandong have gathered more than 25 divisions of troops to launch a planned general offensive. The National Army was forced to counterattack, and the Communist forces suffered repeated defeats, which proves that the Communist forces can only fight sneakily; they are not worth a blow in a fair battle. Currently, the main force of the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu, the New Fourth Army's Third Division, Fourth Division, and Seventh Column, consists of no more than 70,000 men. They have been routed and are retreating to southern Shandong. Xinghua, Dongtai, and Lianshui will be recovered imminently. If progress is smooth, northern Jiangsu can be cleared by the end of the month. Liu Bocheng's unit in western Shandong, with one division and seven columns of over 50,000 men, is on the border between Juye and Jiaxiang. Six of its columns have been defeated, and morale is shaken. The National Army can move into Juye and Jiaxiang at any time. However, the Communist forces in the two regions of Shandong will inevitably fight desperately as trapped beasts, and a major battle will occur.

### Relief Work in Communist-Controlled Areas; Difficult Problems Resolved; 1,500 Tons of Supplies to be Shipped Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, This City] The second batch of relief supplies from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to the Communist-controlled areas of Shandong Province, totaling 1,500 tons, will be shipped to Yantai tomorrow (the 15th) by the Wanheng vessel and then transported to Shiguan (southern Shandong) for distribution to various disaster areas. In the past, there have been various difficulties in transporting UNRRA relief supplies to Communist-controlled areas, but thanks to the continuous efforts of General Wang Shiliang, director of the UNRRA office in Yantai, in the past two months, and his detailed explanations and consultations with relevant authorities, all major problems have been resolved. UNRRA's work in the Beihai region (Shandong Province and southern Hebei) is expected to proceed smoothly.

An Interview with Wang Shiliang

This reporter interviewed Mr. Wang, who is about to go to Shandong, yesterday. He said: Recently, he has met several times in Shanghai with officials from the UNRRA administration and Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communists. He will go north on the Wanheng vessel tomorrow to discuss other unresolved details with the local Communist representatives, and also expand the scope of work of the Yantai office. He will return to Shanghai in two weeks to report on the progress of all work. General Wang also solemnly declared that there are two principles for his work in Yantai: (1) As the director of the Yantai office, he is only an executor of the office's work and does not wish to have any opinions of his own. He only wishes to implement UNRRA's resolutions and policies and execute UNRRA's relief work, accepting all instructions from UNRRA. He will distribute as many relief supplies as UNRRA provides, with a completely impartial spirit, to serve the people. (2) The distribution of UNRRA relief supplies is not disorderly. All relief supplies must be distributed by UNRRA and UNRRA personnel, and they must personally see the relief supplies delivered to the people. In other words, relief supplies will not be transported to areas where UNRRA and UNRRA personnel cannot reach, so as to ensure that the supplies can truly relieve those who need relief. Mr. Wang stated that since he took on the task of relief work, he has been carrying out his duties based on these two major principles. The 1,500 tons of supplies being transported to the Yantai office this time include food, flour, medicine, hospital equipment, and clothing. For the sake of benefiting the people, supplies will continue to be transported to the area in the future. When asked what working problems had been resolved recently with Mr. Zhou Enlai, Mr. Wang replied: (1) The communication problem of the office—to solve the communication difficulties, the Yantai office will set up two radio stations to communicate with the outside world, one in Yantai and one in Linyi. (2) The currency system—the currency used in the Communist-controlled area is the Beihai currency. In the future, the exchange rate will be 1 to 15 (i.e., 15 national currency equals 1 Beihai currency), and the accommodation, food, and furniture for UNRRA staff will be provided locally. (3) Freedom of movement—previously, all strict military areas were prohibited areas. Now, Zhou Enlai has sent a letter to the local authorities, stating that, except for special military areas, UNRRA personnel should be allowed to move freely in other areas. The above three issues have been agreed upon recently. The issue of inland transportation costs is quite serious, because the labor costs for dockworkers and the transportation costs from Yantai to other areas are very high. The UNRRA is willing to bear two-thirds of the costs and requests the Communists to be responsible for one-third. This method can be tried. The Communist Party is considering the proposal. Accompanying Mr. Wang are more than 20 UNRRA staff members, some of whom...

### We Treat Female Guests with State Guest Etiquette; Mrs. Cripps is the First; Foreign Minister Wang Hosts Banquet and Delivers Welcoming Speech Last Night

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Thirteenth] Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie hosted a banquet for Mrs. Cripps on the evening of the 13th. In his speech, he said: "Two and a half years ago, when I and the members of the Chinese delegation to Britain visited Britain, the British United Aid to China Fund warmly received us. Mrs. Cripps delivered a welcoming speech during the banquet. After the speech, Sir Cripps told me that this was Mrs. Cripps' first public speech. I therefore know that Mrs. Cripps is not a person who likes to talk much. She would rather do practical work than be a speaker. Thinking about this, I feel that my welcoming speech tonight, even if it is a little short, does not need to be particularly apologized to Mrs. Cripps. The first thing I want to say is that our country treats female guests with state guest etiquette, and this is the first time. My wife and I are honored to be able to host this banquet tonight. Another noteworthy point is that the huge amount of money donated by the United Aid to China Fund led by Mrs. Cripps has deeply impressed us, but I believe that it is even more valuable that the United Aid to China Fund has enabled the British people to deeply understand the value of China during and after the war. The United Aid to China Fund, led by Mrs. Cripps, has intimately introduced wartime China and the Chinese people to the British people through countless lectures, exhibitions, and publications organized by its numerous branches. This contribution is very important. Finally, I would like to assure Mrs. Cripps and all those who have come with her that your Chinese friends will definitely cooperate with you to the best of their ability to promote Sino-British friendship and understanding. Please join me in raising a glass to wish Mrs. Cripps and all those who have come with her greater success."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Thirteenth] Mrs. Cripps is scheduled to leave Beijing by air for Chongqing at 9:30 AM on the 14th.

She is scheduled to return to Beijing on November 16, and then go to Guangzhou and Hong Kong before flying back to England. It is reported that Mrs. Cripps may make a trip to Shenyang when she arrives in Beiping. Yu Chaoying and Li Zijian Inspect Overseas Chinese in Various Parts of Nanyang.

### Septuagenarian Yuan Xiluo Offers Loyal Advice to the Communists Again; Sends a Telegram to Communist Leaders Through This Newspaper

Yuan Xiluo, the elder who previously appealed for an end to the civil war by "risking his old life" and "going on a hunger strike," wrote his final telegram to the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party on National Day and entrusted this newspaper to publish it as a final appeal. Excerpts are as follows:

To the Shanghai Shenbao, transfer to Mr. Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, and to Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, Generals Zhu De and other communist military leaders, political workers, and party members: Now that it is the Double Ten Festival, I would like to offer you a word. It has been a year since the Japanese invaders surrendered. During this year, if your party and the National Government could put the country first and the lives of the people first, and not engage in military struggles for territory, and work together to form a government of the people of the whole country, and focus on construction and reconstruction, how much could the national interest and the welfare of the people have been increased during this year? But it could not be done! I, Yuan Xiluo, have no choice but to shout loudly again to alert your party. I recall that in January of this year, I wrote two papers on the Datong chapter of the Book of Rites and entrusted my old friend Huang Yanpei to give them to Mr. Zhou Enlai and send them to Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhu, asking them to read them. This Datong chapter is truly a golden rule for saving the human world. It can not only save China from the current internal strife, but also permanently end wars in the world. The so-called Great Way is the way of the world belonging to all. The world belongs to all of humanity. It is definitely not the world of a single family or a single surname in the era of emperors, nor is it the world of a single party or a single leader in the era of democracy. Therefore, the one-party dictatorship, such as the current Soviet communist government's one-party dictatorship, has not truly understood the essence of the world belonging to all. The Chinese Kuomintang has now decided to return power to the people and cannot be criticized further. We should constantly urge it to realize this. The Chinese Communist Party should understand the essence of the world belonging to all and not learn from the Soviet Union's one-party dictatorship. The so-called "selecting the virtuous and capable, emphasizing credibility and cultivating harmony" is truly the key to governing the country. The reason why China is ungoverned today is that the virtuous and capable have not been appointed. Therefore, the use of people must prioritize virtue and ability and not party affiliation, and people should not compete for positions with each other. As for the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which has lasted for more than a decade, it is all due to the failure to emphasize credibility and cultivate harmony. War is like fire, and if it is not suppressed, it will burn itself. Where are Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, the war criminals who were notorious for warmongering? They can serve as a warning. It is regrettable that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party appeared to be united but were divided in spirit during the eight years of bitter war. The fruits of the eight-year War of Resistance were actually due to the victory of the United States. Now, more than a year has passed since the Japanese surrendered, and there have been more than a year of conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communists. There are several things that our people are dissatisfied with the Communist Party: (1) It specializes in destroying railways, disrupting the national transportation lifeline, preventing the exchange of materials, and causing people to go hungry and cold. (2) When the Communist army clashes with the National Army and retreats due to inferior strength, it destroys the embankments of various rivers, causing floods to inundate the people's homes and fields, leaving hundreds of thousands of families and millions of people without food or shelter, in order to protect its party's military force. This is extremely inhumane. (3) Equalization of land ownership is one of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principles and must be implemented by the government after consultation and proper measures. The Communist Party acts rashly and arbitrarily distributes land, using communist methods to make landowners, owner-farmers, and tenant farmers suffer, while idlers benefit. (4) It encourages class struggle and purges, disrupting social order and making it impossible for good people to live in peace. (5) It forces people to express their frankness, infringing on freedom of thought, and its methods are even worse than Qin Shi Huang's "even word abandoned on the market." How can this be allowed? I, Yuan Xiluo, deeply love Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhu as outstanding figures in China and cannot bear to see them fail due to the indiscriminate use of ideologies and methods. I offer loyal advice again. Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhu should know the history of Mr. Hong Xiuquan. Hong Xiuquan started an uprising in Jintian, vowing to expel the Manchus and restore the Han Chinese world, but was defeated by Zeng, Zuo, and Li, thus extending the Qing dynasty's lifespan by seventy years. I have great respect for Mr. Hong and condemn Zeng, Zuo, and Li for forgetting their ethnicity. Then I studied the reasons for Mr. Hong's failure. He disregarded the etiquette of the Chinese sages and wise men and set fire to all Confucian temples, Buddhist temples, and Taoist temples when he organized the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Zeng, Zuo, and Li were all Confucian scholars and therefore rose up in opposition, turning this war into a holy war of Chinese etiquette. And Mr. Hong's revolution, the grand plan to restore the Han Chinese territory, disappeared after seventeen years. This is very regrettable. Now, I am worried that you will face a similar danger. You use the name of Chinese communism to indicate that you are different from the Soviets, but communism actually originated with Marx and was implemented in Soviet Russia by Lenin. Marx's theory cannot be as perfect as the Great Harmony described by our Confucius, so why must we learn from Marx and forget Confucius? If you do not wake up and continue to seize territory by force and do not cooperate with the people of the country, the result will inevitably be Outer Mongolia II, which is an inevitable result. Mr. Zhou Enlai criticized the United States' China policy, saying that the United States is helping the Kuomintang. I believe that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has troubled Special Envoy Marshall to mediate, and the mediation has failed, and then we have to trouble Ambassador Stuart to mediate. It is embarrassing for these foreign elders over seventy years old to be running around on airplanes and in cars for the sake of the disharmony of Chinese brothers. It is a disgrace to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and a disgrace to all the people of China. I am also over seventy years old and would like to have an airplane and car to run around and prevent the internal war in China. First of all, I would like to warn the gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party: Forty years ago, I joined the Tongmenghui organized by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Between Xinhai and Renzi, I served as the representative of Jiangsu Province in organizing the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, acting as a provisional senator. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen took office as the President, I held the seal of the President, representing the people of the Republic of China, and presented it to Mr. Sun Yat-sen. After that, I retired to the field of education and educated the citizens of the Republic of China. I am not a member of the Kuomintang at all levels, nor am I appointed as the head or member of a department or committee of the Kuomintang as a party member, but I deeply understand the Buddhist Vehicle, possess a great fearless spirit, and have the perseverance to cut flesh to feed a tiger. I regard the hunger of my Chinese compatriots as my own hunger and the drowning of my compatriots as my own drowning. If there is anyone who starts a war and harms the people, whether they are from the Kuomintang or the Communist Party, I will oppose them. Before the National Government is completely reformed, I respectfully offer the following measures: (1) Please Mr. Mao Zedong go to Nanjing immediately and join hands with President Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, invite the representatives of the seventeen provinces who organized the Republic of China in the year of Xinhai (excluding those who were in Zhao Ming's puppet government) to Beijing to participate in the meeting. Then, the National Government should invite ten elders from the non-partisan parties to Beijing to participate in the meeting. The Chinese Communist Party and the China Democratic League may each propose one person. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are invited to serve as advisors to this meeting. This meeting will resolve national affairs. Immediately, please President Chiang Kai-shek order a ceasefire and stop attacking Zhangjiakou. Mr. Mao Zedong should order the Communist army to withdraw to 30 li outside Zhangjiakou, and the Communist army in northern Jiangsu should withdraw to 60 li in the area bordering Jiangsu and Shandong, in order to avoid conflicts. Yuan Xiluo, citizen of the Republic of China. Good, telegram.

Editorial

### Comforting Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies

"Dutch East Indies" is a political region, not a purely geographical name. Geographically, it's part of the East Indies archipelago. After the Dutch first entered Java in 1596, they gradually expanded, and in 1609, after breaking away from Spain and becoming a republic, they established Batavia as their political center. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company was established, laying the foundation for the Dutch East Indies empire. From then on, the Dutch succeeded, and the overseas Chinese failed! Reports say that Special Envoy Li Dijun, dispatched by our country to Java, just arrived in Singapore on the 11th, and will go to the Dutch East Indies soon. Today, Special Envoy Li's comforting of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is the most obvious proof of the failure of overseas Chinese.

The overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have not only failed, but are simply "people as the cutting board, and we as the fish and meat," old wounds not healed, new pains piled up. Please look at the Guangdong Governor Zhang Zhidong's report in 1886 (Guangxu 12th year) on the suffering of more than 70,000 overseas Chinese in Batavia, please look at the Minister to the Netherlands and Austria, Lü Haihuan's memorial in 1901 (Guangxu 27th year), bitterly denouncing the atrocities of the Dutch authorities against overseas Chinese. In 1740, the Dutch officially ordered the massacre of our overseas Chinese, the fire in Batavia lit up the sky, cries echoed everywhere, the old and young, women and children all died under the Dutch axes, blood flowed everywhere, even the river water turned red, with over ten thousand dead, historically known as the "Red River Massacre," an unprecedented tragedy!

After the victory of the War of Resistance, our two million compatriots in the Dutch East Indies are still trapped in deep waters. For example: (1) In the conflict between the Allied forces and Indonesians in Surabaya, over a thousand overseas Chinese were bombed to death, and 15,000 were left homeless; (2) In Cibaduyut, bombed by the Allied forces, hundreds of our overseas Chinese died; (3) During the tug-of-war between the two sides, Jiao Han became a battlefield, and hundreds of our overseas Chinese went missing; (4) All overseas Chinese in Padang were besieged, suffering endlessly; (5) In Medan, over 20,000 overseas Chinese were subjected to 621 incidents of arson and looting within half a year; (6) Over 3,300 Chinese refugees in Bekasi were unable to live in peace; (7) The bloody tragedy of the large-scale massacre in Tangerang has not yet dried, and the Baken tragedy followed one after another, with 200 overseas Chinese dying in self-defense. In addition, overseas Chinese engaged in business suffered even more severely, with the Indonesian government raising import and export taxes to an alarming extent, while the Dutch East Indies government intercepted 40 of our overseas Chinese merchant ships, and detained and humiliated the crew, resulting in losses of over 700,000 national currency units.

The motherland couldn't bear it anymore, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, after rushing about since last year, finally managed to produce a Dutch East Indies Comfort Mission. This organization is composed of representatives from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Department, among others. After Special Envoy Li's departure, we heard about this comfort mission, and couldn't help but offer a few words of advice. The members constituting the comfort mission must have a sound organization and act in unison, avoiding individual activities. China should be a "nation of ten thousand chariots," and representatives going abroad must have the demeanor of "ten thousand chariots." What is valued in overseas Chinese affairs experts and diplomats is that their vision should be placed far ahead and in the future. Wang Anshi said to Zeng Zigou, "Reading the classics alone is not enough to understand the classics," meaning that one must read other books to understand the classics. Handling overseas Chinese affairs and diplomacy should be even more so, and one should look for problems outside the problems, and then one can solve the problems.

The representatives must have a thorough understanding of the history, geography, politics, economy, society, and ethnicity of the Dutch East Indies, especially religion. In addition to extending warm comfort to our overseas Chinese compatriots, who are like branches connected to the same root, one should also bring some education to them, and even more so encourage them and remind them. Justice always triumphs in the end. In all matters under heaven, "if you act and do not succeed, turn inward and examine yourself." One should truly put in effort with the Dutch, the Indonesians, and even relevant third-country individuals, and merely saying "neutrality" is still not enough.

We want to respectfully tell the Dutch that you have ruled the Dutch East Indies for three hundred years, and to this day you have left 90 percent of the people illiterate on this fertile land, which is a great shame. The People's Council (Volksraad), established in 1918, although improved twice in 1922 and 1925, still had representatives from not universally representative classes, and too narrow of powers, which was a great mistake. The general population lives too poorly, lingering on the brink of starvation all year round, with wages earned in your hands only 50 cents to 1.15 yuan per week, with an average daily income of only two cents per person, which is a great source of disaster. You have harmed overseas Chinese with bloody means, and having suffered the ravages of fascism yourselves, you relied on China's War of Resistance and the Allied victory, and you have returned to the East, taking the atrocities that the fascists used against you to inflict upon your ally China's overseas Chinese compatriots, which is even more despicable! The world is changing, and you should change too! If you don't change, others will force you to change. We advise the Dutch East Indies government to be smarter, let the long-oppressed people breathe a sigh of relief, and suffer less, so as to avoid them going astray, resulting in a lose-lose situation.

At the same time, we want to offer a few words of sincere advice to the Indonesians: In three hundred years, you have launched more than seventy anti-Dutch movements, from the patriotic beginnings of the youth organization Budi Utomo, through the leftist Islamic League and religious political reform movements, the major strikes of the PFB trade union, the non-cooperation of the Communist Party, all the way to the truly nationalist movement of the All-Indonesia Party (PNI), we have always remembered them. Supporting small and weak nations is the national policy set by Sun Yat-sen, and if there is anyone in the world who can truly sympathize with you and help you, it should be China. You have 735,267 square miles of fertile land, equal to the combined area of France, Italy, Austria, and Sweden; you account for 97 percent of the 67 million people; you have 130 ethnic groups, 25 written languages, and 250 dialects, and you should strengthen unity, strengthen unification, and strengthen trust in your fraternal country, China.

The overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies help local prosperity. They are empty-handed, with no national military force as a backing, and even less with any intention of encroachment. They have all been baptized by the Chinese Kingly Way culture, are the most benevolent, the most peaceful, "all within the four seas are brothers," is the overseas Chinese way of life. During the war, although the enemy used malicious instigation and poisonous propaganda, saying that the Chinese are "aggressors," the overseas Chinese should always be in contact with the Indonesians, and use iron facts to prove who is the hegemon and who is the aggressor. The overseas Chinese cannot merely use "neutrality" as an excuse to avoid reality, and must, in light of the current problems in the Dutch East Indies, advise the Indonesians to have right and wrong, to distinguish friends from enemies, and never fall into the enemy's trap! The comfort mission must remind the Indonesians for the sake of the overseas Chinese: they must know that reckless and murderous butchers can never kill their way to heaven! Seeking the sympathy of the Indonesians from the pure overseas Chinese is the greatest wish!

### Many Illnesses in the Cool Autumn

Autumn has arrived, and the weather has suddenly turned cooler. While cholera has receded, diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and colds have arrived on time. Birth, old age, sickness, and death are the four major sufferings of life, and sickness is a barrier between life and death. Although it may not be the most serious, it is still a blow to both the spirit and the body.

According to recent reports, there seem to be especially many cases of diphtheria. The hot summer has receded, and the bitter cold has not yet arrived. This temperature should be the most comfortable weather for life, but unexpectedly, this not-hot-not-cold climate is also suitable for the propagation of germs. We should especially take care to protect our health in this suitable weather.

Now, the cost of living has risen alarmingly, and getting sick is even more unaffordable! For serious illnesses, asking a doctor for a house call has reached the shocking price of 100,000 yuan per visit; only after 5 p.m. can some doctors' house call fees be reduced to a still-substantial 50,000 yuan, but for those suffering from acute illnesses, life is at risk in an instant, how can they leisurely wait until dusk? This is just the consultation fee, and there are also handling fees, medicine fees, and tips for the doctor's driver, which patients find difficult to bear. Outpatient visits are slightly cheaper, usually 10,000 yuan per visit, but in the short space of a morning, many patients are crowded into the small clinic of a famous doctor, and there are even those who pay extra fees to jump the queue. Thus, those who are poor and suffering from serious and acute illnesses have no choice but to await death. Municipal and public hospitals charge far less than private doctors, but with Shanghai's population so large, its area so vast, and public finances so strained, it is impossible to provide ordinary services to the city's sick. Under these circumstances, everyone who falls ill in Shanghai cannot help but deeply lament their suffering.

The purpose of practicing medicine is to save the world, and doctors are respected because they hold the lofty ambition of helping the world and saving people. Unexpectedly, due to the impact of the war, all of this is now out of the question. If we calculate a doctor's fee of 100,000 yuan per house call, a doctor with a little status will have a monthly income many times higher than the monthly salary of a national president? In addition, there are income from outpatient visits, income from prescriptions, and income from handling fees, and their monthly income is often astonishing. Practicing medicine has become a private tool for making money. The harm that this phenomenon does to society and the deep pain that individuals suffer is difficult to express. No wonder the British Labour government also advocates nationalizing medicine.

Currently, there are restrictions on everything, price controls on rice and oil, gold sales, and the prohibition of trading in US dollars. Even the fares for rickshaws and pedicabs were announced with a standard not long ago. But for medical expenses, which are a matter of life and death, doctors are allowed to extort arbitrarily, and it has not been heard that the health authorities have said a word, or that the municipal authorities have issued a decree, to seek a penny of life for the city's sick people. Doctors and their families naturally need to live, which is a matter of course, but doctors' work cannot just be about making money. If you want to make a fortune, just do business straightforwardly, but as for doctors, they have a sacred responsibility in addition to living.

We demand that the health authorities immediately and thoroughly investigate the fee situation of doctors in the city, and then take the most rapid measures to impose reasonable restrictions. Who can guarantee to be free from illness all year round? When a person is sick and needs to see a doctor and take medicine, the need is more urgent than eating when not sick, and the suffering of being poor and sick is probably something that friends with plenty to eat and wear cannot understand even a fraction of. The municipal authorities should now pay attention to this issue as all measures are gradually getting on track.

We absolutely have no intention of attacking any doctor. Logically, doctors' work is dangerous and hard, and collecting consultation fees is justified. However, for the sake of the health of the city's citizens, we must oppose the small number of greedy and profit-seeking unethical doctors who use practicing medicine as a private tool for making a fortune. As this deep autumn arrives, almost every family has children, wives, or themselves, or other family members, who are having a new experience with autumn illnesses, whether mild or severe. Whether it is consultation fees, medicine fees, or handling fees, none of them are not the greatest sorrow for salaried workers. Today, the majority of people have reached the point where they cannot live, cannot die, and even cannot afford to be sick. A very large and serious problem is emerging in Shanghai society. The municipal authorities should do everything possible to solve this problem and reduce some of the suffering of the poor and sick citizens.

### Security of Transportation Lines in Northern Jiangsu Can Be Guaranteed, Post-War Affairs in Townships Actively Handled, Remaining Communist Troops Actually Massacring the People

[Report from this newspaper in Gaoyou, 13th] The commander of the 25th Division of the National Army, Huang Baishao, arrived in Gaoyou on the morning of the 12th, when soldiers and civilians alike reached the county seat, the people all hung the Blue Sky White Sun national flag and set off firecrackers to welcome them. The order in Gaoyou City has now been restored. The use of the anti-currency has also been stopped, and the Central China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank, and the Provincial Bank have established offices, and the serious currency system problem can now be easily solved. After the recovery of the entire line along the Grand Canal, the security of all highway and waterway transportation problems can be guaranteed, but the security order in the countryside of Gaoyou and Baoying counties is very worrying. The National Army is now actively handling post-war affairs in the townships, and is being very lenient, and has issued proclamations, allowing all people who have been coerced by the Communist troops to participate in work to register for self-renewal with the respective township offices. However, there are still a few bad elements in these two counties who collude with the remaining Communist troops to oppress good people and disturb the security. People in Northern Jiangsu are unanimously hoping that the central and Jiangsu provincial authorities will quickly eliminate the remaining Communist troops in the rural areas along the Grand Canal. For this major plan of elimination, it is appropriate to quickly come up with a solution and seek a unified plan for post-war affairs. The relief work in Northern Jiangsu has now been actively launched. Commander Huang is convening people from all walks of life to discuss thorough post-war solutions for relief work in Gaoyou City and rural areas. According to reports, in the Zhuoyang Lake rural area at the border of Gaoyou and Jiangdu, there are still a small number of remaining Communist troops who are arbitrarily ravaging the area and do not hesitate to kill many people. More than one hundred people were killed the day before yesterday, and the situation is extremely tragic. At the same time, similar situations have occurred in the rural areas of Fanchuan and Xiaoji towns. This matter is extremely worthy of attention. It is heard that Commander Huang is now preparing to start suppressing them in order to achieve the goal of ensuring local security and stabilizing people's livelihoods.

[Another dispatch] This newspaper's special correspondent, Fang Canglang, left Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 12th, taking with him the elder generation of Taibao newspapers, and took a boat to Shaobo and Gaoyou in the recovered area of Northern Jiangsu to provide spiritual food for comforting the soldiers and civilians in the front lines.

### The Homecoming Corps Undertakes Night Patrols, Raids Qidong Again, Posts Slogans and Propaganda, and Returns

[Report from this newspaper in Nanpu] The various units that went to the various ports of this county on the 8th to carry out a second raid returned at midnight on the 10th. According to reports, the units participating in this raid included the First Brigade of the Homecoming Corps, the Water Police Team, the Police Detachment, and part of the First Security Detachment. Late at night on the 8th, taking advantage of the initial rising tide, they departed in eleven civilian boats, divided into two routes. One route went to Yongchang Port in this county, led by Sun Xuxian, the chief of the police detachment, and the other route went to Yonglong Port in this county, led by Shi Zhengqiu, the chief of the First Brigade of the Homecoming Corps. The route to Yongchang Port failed to set sail due to the tide and wind direction, and joined the other route at Yonglong Port in the evening of the 9th. The Communist troops stationed in this port were part of Cao Shiying's unit of the Southeast Guard Regiment, consisting of more than forty people, carrying a light machine gun. After the units landed, they were on strict alert while searching forward. At that time, the bright moon was in the sky, and autumn insects were chirping. The residents were all awakened from their dreams. The Communist troops, upon learning of our landing, first fired a gun to demonstrate. Our units immediately returned fire and simultaneously advanced in different directions. For a time, gunfire broke the silence of the long night. After more than ten minutes, the Communist troops were unable to withstand and retreated north. The units, having completed their mission, rested briefly in the town, and after posting slogans and propaganda, returned on the original boats within the specified time. According to Sun Xuxian, the chief of the police detachment, all ports in this county are stationed with the Communist Southeast Guard Regiment, militiamen, and tax collectors, but the number of people is extremely uncertain, and their purpose is purely to collect taxes and inspect incoming and outgoing ships, and their strength is minimal and cannot withstand a single blow. When the reporter inquired about how the materials seized by the various units in the first raid were handled, it was said that the seized materials were mostly printed cloth, broad beans, newsprint, and buttons, and that these materials were directly related to the Communist troops. After investigation, it has now been clarified that the materials of merchants who were not colluding with the Communist troops have been returned one by one by the county government, while the various materials related to the Communist troops have to be dealt with.

### Ying Shang County Magistrate Inspects News

[Report from Hefei] The Yingshang Daily recently reported that at the general meeting of the county council, various councilors questioned the county government on various issues, and the county government showed embarrassment from time to time. This news was met with dissatisfaction by the county government, and the county magistrate of the county, Wei Mianzhi, forced the Yingshang Daily to send the articles to be published daily to the county government for inspection in advance. The national news censorship system has long been abolished by national decree. People generally hope that the provincial news agency will correct and stop such actions by the county magistrate.

### Zhejiang Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference Opens on the 16th, Lasting Four Days, Also Discussing Important Policies Such as Finance, Food, and Security

### Disaster in Dongting Xishan

[Report from this newspaper in Suzhou] Dongting Xishan suffered continuous heavy rain at the beginning of summer. Fortunately, the local authorities and the Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association did their best to help, using motorized boats to pump water day and night, so that the farmland was spared from being submerged, and the farmers were able to breathe a sigh of relief. However, on the 23rd of last month, they were suddenly hit by a hurricane, followed by torrential rain, which caused the water level to rise sharply by more than two feet. More than 2,800 mu of polder land in the Donghe Town, Qixian Township, and Dongyuan Township under its jurisdiction were all submerged. The rice ears were also blown by the hurricane and immersed in the water. The early rice had already sprouted and looked severely like a seedling field and was completely lost. If the late rice can be rescued urgently, there may be a 10-20% harvest. Yesterday, Zhu Rongqing, the town chief of Donghe Town in the area, together with local people, publicly elected Zhu Chuansheng to go to Wuxi via Suzhou to hire four motorized boats to transport to the mountains day and night to pump water in order to carry out emergency rescue. In addition to jointly submitting a report to the district office, county government, and temporary council by the township chiefs, they also telegraphed the Xishan Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association to call for relief.

[Another report] More than 400 mu of paddy fields in Guanchang Township, First District, were flooded due to heavy rain, and all were submerged. The autumn harvest is imminent, and all hope has been lost. Hundreds of farming families have been affected, and the disaster is severe. Township Chief Shi Yushan specially submitted reports to the County Temporary Council, County Government, District Office, Food and Grain Office, and the Field Industry Improvement Association on the 11th to find ways for relief.

### Zhejiang Province Approved for Appropriation to Build Prisons and Courts

[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou, 13th] Although the facilities of the judicial organs in the counties of Zhejiang are better than those of other provinces in the country, only six counties in the province did not fall during the eight years of the War of Resistance, and the various recommendations were greatly destroyed by the artillery fire. The judicial organs were not spared, and only a few places such as Hangzhou and Yin County suffered less loss, while other places, even if they were complete, were old and unsuitable for use. Therefore, how to urgently seek reconstruction has become a top priority. When Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, came to Hangzhou, he investigated the situation in detail. It is now learned that he has agreed to allocate 2.5 billion yuan for the construction of prisons and courts throughout Zhejiang Province, of which Hangzhou can allocate more than 1.2 billion yuan, but the fundamental construction still requires a large amount of assistance from the central government.

### Rampant Banditry on the Border of Wu, Dan, and Jin Counties; Self-Defense Team Firearms Confiscated; Eight Team Members Kidnapped and Brutally Murdered

[Special Dispatch from Wujin] Wujin is situated in the heart of the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, bordered by the Yangtze River to the north, Lake Ge to the southwest, adjacent to Danyang and Jintan, and bordering Lake Tai to the southeast. It is a vast plain with fields of grain, originally the wealthiest land of fish and rice in the Jiangnan region. However, after eight years of enemy and puppet regime devastation and banditry, its vitality has been almost entirely depleted. In particular, the border area between Wu, Dan, and Jin, with its complex terrain and inconsistent governance, has recently become a nest for bandit gangs, with tragic killings and atrocities occurring frequently. On the eve of National Day, at midnight, a case of bandit gangs attacking the self-defense team and seizing firearms occurred again in Houxu Town, District 2, more than forty li southwest of Wujin city. As a result, all the firearms of the self-defense team were confiscated, and more than eleven team members were killed or injured. Since the firearms of the self-defense team in Dong'an Town, District 9, adjacent to Houxu, were completely confiscated by bandits last month on the 20th, people have been feeling anxious. This case has caused widespread shock, and the security of the rural areas has become an increasing concern. The rural populace is universally feeling insecure. If timely suppression is not carried out, a single spark will start a prairie fire, and the aftermath is deeply worrying.

Midnight Attack

Houxu is a large market town in the southwest of Wujin, but its location near Lake Ge, with access to Dan and Jin to the west, has always been a haven for bandit gangs. On April 26th of this year, the self-defense team in the town had five long and short firearms confiscated by bandits, and team member Wang Jinsheng was shot in three places. Five months passed, and the murder case was never solved. Unexpectedly, before one wave had subsided, another arose, and a second firearm confiscation suddenly occurred. The reason was that the four villages of Qinhe, Houxu, Xuyou, and Jinfeng in District 2 formed a joint self-defense team. The county assigned Zhu Wenyu to be responsible for supervision and training, with 25 rifles, 1 light machine gun, and 5 pistols. The strength was quite substantial. Stationed in Houxu Town, at midnight on the 9th of this month, the self-defense team sentries initially saw a child approaching from afar, whose behavior was suspicious. They took him to the team for questioning. Upon their return, gunshots suddenly rang out. Bandit leader Zhuang Ziming (a local) led a gang of fifty or sixty bandits, surging towards the self-defense team from three directions. The self-defense team members hastily fought back. For a time, gunshots rang out, and bullets rained down. After about an hour of fierce fighting, team members Zhang Qinghai and Yang Fu were seriously injured, and Jiang Quangen died in the line of duty. Four bandits were also killed and four or five were injured. Helplessly, because the self-defense team ran out of ammunition and had nothing to fight with, the bandits took advantage of the situation to surround them and force them to surrender their weapons. Twenty-two rifles, one machine gun, and two quick-firing guns were confiscated. All the equipment and utensils of the entire team were collected together and set on fire. Before leaving, in addition to carrying away the bandit corpses and injured bandits, they also kidnapped deputy commander Dai Chuanxun, Duan Jiyuan, machine gunner Yang Zhenhua, and team members Yu Longsheng, Shi Kunsheng, Yu Fengsheng, and others, a total of eight people. They were taken to the Fuzong Ancestral Hall in Huangnidun, more than two li southwest of the town, where they were brutally murdered one by one. Their bodies were dismembered, and their flesh and blood were blurred. The methods were cruel and unbearable to witness. Afterward, the District 2 District Office immediately reported the situation to the county government and suggested that supervisor Zhu Wenyu be prosecuted for leaving the team that night and failing to defend the area. After receiving the report, the county government immediately reported the situation to the Capital Garrison Headquarters, the Wuxi Command Post, the Provincial Security Command, and the District 2 Commissioner's Office, as well as the Danyang Joint Defense Command and other agencies, awaiting instructions.

Elusive Bandit Traces

According to those familiar with the rural areas, bandit gangs are everywhere in the rural areas these days. They form small groups of three or five, lurking and rising at night, elusive and unpredictable. Upon hearing of any major activity, they can gather fifty or sixty people, or even more than a hundred, with complete firearms. The villagers know where they stay, but they dare not report it. If they do, death will immediately follow. The areas where they often lurk are the border areas of the three counties of Wu, Dan, and Jin, such as Dong'an, Dadun, Caixi, Laohezhuang, Lizhuangqiao, Huangtang, Zhanglou, etc., which are their frequent haunts. The bandit leaders are Xue Bin and Zhuang Ziming. They constantly roam every night, forcibly collecting land taxes everywhere, stipulating fifteen dan of white rice per village. If anyone refuses, they will be assassinated. The villagers are forced by their power and influence to pay in order to avoid danger, causing them unbearable suffering. They all deeply hope that the army can suppress them in the shortest possible time and relieve the people from their distress.

### Wuxi Self-Government Tax Revenue Exceeds 90 Million Last Month

[Special Dispatch from Wuxi] The five self-government taxes collected by the county's tax collection office, including business licenses, vehicle licenses, entertainment tax, slaughter tax, and property tax, totaled 90,967,323 yuan in September. The revenue from deed tax was 49 million yuan. In addition, the business tax has already been collected and will be investigated starting next Monday.

### Suzhou Conscription to Begin Immediately; Jiangyin to Hold Draft Lottery Today

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou] This county has been ordered to implement conscription. The quota approved by the provincial government is 980. The county government has decided on the distribution method at a meeting of district chiefs, with conscription based on the bao (group of households) as the unit, and each district conscripting an average number of recruits. District 1: 300 recruits, District 2: 80 recruits, District 3: 63 recruits, District 4: 86 recruits, District 5: 48 recruits, District 6: 128 recruits, District 7: 50 recruits, District 8: 48 recruits, District 9: 48 recruits, District 10: 42 recruits, District 11: 28 recruits, District 12: 21 recruits, District 13: 30 recruits, totaling 980 recruits. Conscription will begin immediately. However, in order to take into account the local situation, it is not limited to recruits of local origin. Migrants, vagrants, and adventurers will also be recruited.

[Special Dispatch from Jiangyin] This county has been ordered to handle the first phase of conscription. The county government has organized a conscription committee to actively handle the matter. The roster of eligible men from each district and town has been completed. On the 13th, eligible men will go to designated hospitals for physical examinations. On the 14th, a lottery will be held at the county government to determine the conscripts. The selected conscripts will be announced within 1-2 days and will report on a specified date. They will then undergo temporary training for half a month before being sent to the Wuxi Corps Area for collective training.

### Bandit Suppression in Zhangzhu

[Special Dispatch from Zhangzhu] Yixing's Zhangzhu borders the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, with thousands of mountains and valleys. Therefore, bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, and the local area has suffered greatly. A troop has recently been dispatched to the mountains to begin suppression. County Magistrate Guo, accompanied by Secretary Xu of the county party headquarters, made a special trip to Zhangzhu to convene a meeting of the district office, party headquarters, chamber of commerce, town hall, youth league, and all the bao chiefs and industry directors of Zhangzhu to instruct them on three important policies: reorganizing the baojia system, electing councilors, and eradicating opium. Separate meetings were also held with the heads of each township to inquire about the local bandit situation and various tasks.

### Illegal Operation of Suzhou Public Buses Arouses Public Opinion; County Provisional Council Launches Fierce Criticism

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou] After the Jinshan Motor Company started operating public buses in the city, the county government, considering that it concerned the public welfare and transportation of the citizens of Suzhou, sent a letter to the Provisional Council to investigate whether the company complied with the construction regulations. The council sent Deputy Speaker Fan Gongren and councilors Zhang Shoupeng and others to conduct an inquiry on the morning of the 3rd. After days of extensive interviews and consultations, they have prepared an investigation report. A reporter notes that the issue of public buses in the city has previously sparked fierce debate in society. Some believe that if public buses are not operated, then so be it. If they are operated, they must be fully equipped and safe, and should be invested in and operated by local entities. Others believe that the operation of public buses is an evolution of social transportation, and even if it is simple and crude at the beginning, or if it is impossible to attract local investment, it should be encouraged and assisted. The debate has continued until now without a conclusion. Although the Construction Department has strictly ordered the Jinshan Company to organize and operate according to the former principle, it is doubtful whether they will comply. The society is paying close attention to this matter. The reporter specially visited Councilor Zhang Shoupeng, who participated in the investigation, and received his ten points of opinion: (1) Although the capital is 100 million yuan, there is a certificate issued by an accountant, but there are no formal account books or proof of verification for verification. (2) The company claims to have adopted the method of establishment by initiation, and the fixed capital is fully subscribed and paid by the founders, without publicly soliciting shares in the local area. (3) When the company applied for registration and permission, it stated that the location was No. 224 Jingde Road, but now it claims that there is another general management office in Shanghai. Therefore, all important documents and account books are kept at the general office in Shanghai. If this is not an excuse, it is clearly inconsistent with the original articles of association. (4) There are currently seven trucks, and all the equipment is incomplete and unsafe. They are simply called temporary public buses. According to Deputy Manager Hu Qida, there are also 111 new vehicles that will soon arrive in Suzhou, and ten more bodies have been purchased to be gradually assembled into formal public buses, each worth about 9.4 million yuan. However, according to the company's business plan, the method of using capital to install vehicles is 90 million yuan, but the vehicles purchased now exceed the total capital. If this is not empty talk, it is clearly contradictory. (5) It was originally planned to open two lines first, but only one line is currently operating, and it does not match the original route map. (6) The actual daily revenue is about 1 million yuan, which is much less than the original budget. This shows that the estimated budget is either deliberately reduced or too inaccurate. (7) This public welfare transportation undertaking is completely controlled by the thirteen founders and shareholders, who monopolize the benefits. This is unreasonable and cannot be ignored for the sake of the entire Suzhou area. (8) The biggest legal basis for the company's establishment and operation is only a business license from the Provincial Highway Bureau. However, it is doubtful whether the operation of public buses in the city is under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Highway Bureau. (9) Su and Huan, two companies organized by local people, have also complied with the construction regulations and submitted a request to the county government for permission to operate public buses in the city. The county government has ignored them, which is ignoring the laws, regulations, and public opinion, and cannot be ignored. (10) Jiang Zhongyi, the chief of the county construction section, privately dispatched investigators to Jinshan Company to be responsible for auditing. Whether this is appropriate should also be studied. At the 23rd resident meeting of the Provisional Council, based on the above ten points, the Jinshan Motor Company and the county government were severely criticized. It was believed that it was both illegal and unpopular, and it was decided to send a letter back to the county government to report to the province for handling.

### Woman Hangs Herself from a Beam After Losing Money Trading Yarn

[Special Dispatch from Jiangyin] Recently, the market price of yarn has been fluctuating, making it difficult for those who trade in it to maintain stability. Zhu Yonghong, a resident of Zhujiatun, Yaosai Township, and his wife, Dai, were trading in yarn and had lost more than 2 million yuan. They sold three mu of land, but it was still not enough. On the night of the 9th, his wife, Dai, hanged herself to death.

### Tunxi Detective Squad Leader Protects Opium Dens

[Tunxi] The Seventh District Commissioner's Office yesterday received a confidential report that Yu Bin (aka Yu Baiqing), a patrol officer and detective squad leader of the Tunxi Police Bureau, was suspected of protecting opium dens. The Commissioner's Office immediately ordered the Tunxi Police Bureau to detain and interrogate Patrol Officer Yu Bin. It also dispatched personnel to conduct investigations based on the clues in the confidential report, arresting two opium offenders and confiscating opium paraphernalia, and sent them to the Commissioner's Office for legal processing.

### Automobile Lane on Top Layer of Qiantang River Bridge to be Temporarily Repaired with Foreign Pine; Permanent Repairs to be Studied and Designed in the Long Term

[Dispatch from Hangzhou, 13th] The Qiantang River Railway Bridge was blown up by the National Army during the retreat in November 1937. The Japanese army actively repaired it starting in 1941, and it was finally opened to trains. However, the automobile lane on the top layer is still destroyed for five spans, more than 1,000 feet long. It has now been contracted to the Dongya Construction Company. Ironworkers and carpenters have been brought in from Shanghai. The design engineer is Yuan Zhigang of the China Bridge Company. According to Yuan, the current work is to replace the concrete with foreign pine to pave the bridge surface and repair the severely damaged steel frames so that automobiles weighing less than 20 tons can pass. At the same time, the road south of the bridge to Xiaoshan, which has also been destroyed for about one kilometer, will also be repaired to the point where it can be opened to traffic. The entire project is expected to be completed within two months. As for permanent repairs, they will be studied and designed in the long term.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides to Hold Special Meeting to Discuss and Implement Resolutions of the Provincial Council

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 13th] The 208 resolutions of the first general meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Council have been delivered to the provincial government and relevant agencies one by one. They will be delivered within the next few days. In order to carefully consider the implementation of these resolutions, the provincial government has decided to hold a special government committee meeting dedicated to discussing implementation methods. According to a responsible person of the provincial government, they will try their best to respect the opinions of the people's representative body and implement them, unless it is absolutely necessary to refuse to comply. However, for some resolutions that require a central government decision, the provincial government can only forward its opinions.

### Reader's Opinions - Regulations

(2) Do not attack private individuals, and do not submit the same manuscript to multiple publications. (3) Contributors must write "Reader's Opinions Manuscript" on their submissions and must provide their real name and address, but a pseudonym may be used when published.

Not long ago, at the Xikang Road/Changshou Road terminal of the No. 24 trolleybus, whenever an empty bus turned around, the passengers on the platform would rush forward, scrambling to get on. The disorder was unbearable to describe. Often, the young and strong would push their way through, disregarding everything. Women, children, and the elderly and infirm would be pushed down. Clothes would be torn, and there would even be shouts and cries. In this kind of situation, getting on the bus was like escaping a disaster. No one would believe that such a chaotic scene existed unless they had experienced it firsthand. Because I live there and have to go to the central district for work every day, I have been suffering from the crowding for more than a day. But at that time, there was no police officer to maintain order, and the chaos and jostling continued. However, since last month, the order has suddenly improved. Whether old or young, men or women, people line up in a single file, and enter the bus in an orderly manner when it arrives. There is no more rushing and jostling. It turns out that several military police are regularly maintaining order at the station. It is said that they were sent by the Putuo District. From then on, residents in that area no longer have to worry about taking the bus. I hope that other stations can also have the same measures taken, and the passengers will be extremely grateful.

Streetlights Should be Monitored to Save Electricity

In order to save electricity, the water and electricity companies in this city have stopped supplying outdoor neon lights, etc., reducing consumption and advocating thrift. This is indeed a good way. However, the streetlights on the roads are inevitably a little dim, especially on the side streets and lanes, where it is simply impossible to see clearly. At a time when there are many vehicles, each driving at full speed and advancing like flying, one cannot help but worry that there will be collisions due to the darkness and blurring. In addition, many tricycles and bicycles do not turn on their lights in accordance with the regulations. This is very dangerous. It is hoped that the police authorities will pay attention to this and strictly urge all vehicles to turn on their lights at night and to drive more slowly. On the one hand, this will reduce the harm of accidents, and on the other hand, it will preserve the excellent system of saving electricity.

Request for More Early Morning Ferry Services

We are a group of residents of Pudong who have to go to Shanghai for work every day. The round trip twice a day depends entirely on the municipal ferry. However, since the abolition of summer time on October 1, the ferry company has changed the sailing schedule in order to connect with the trains on the Shanghai-Chuansha Railway. The difference compared to before is very large, and in the morning, it is necessary to wait until 9:00 to get from Wusong to Shanghai, which will inevitably cause delays in work. I recently read in your newspaper that the ferry company has newly completed the "Jiangsu" ferry, which will also be added to the Songhu Line. I am very pleased to read this. Therefore, please reveal our grievances in one corner of the newspaper, hoping that the ferry company can adopt my humble opinion and add more early morning services so that we can arrive in Shanghai around 8:00, which would be a public convenience. (A group of residents from Donggou and Qingning Temple)

Questioning Unreasonable Rent Increases

(1) I rented a small attic room from the Xie family in April 1945 for a monthly rent of 300 yuan. In March of this year, I received a notice from the landlord saying that the rent would be increased, but he did not specify how much. It was not until September of this year that he said that the rent would be increased to 7,000 yuan per month starting from March, which is about 25 times the original amount. If the price of goods rises and the rent increases, it is reasonable, but it must be in accordance with the fair market price to be reasonable. The Municipal Council decided that there was no need to increase the rent at all and cracked down on the extra demands of second landlords. While submitting it to the municipal government for approval, the second landlord actually increased the rent by 25 times. Is this reasonable? It is even more unreasonable to retroactively collect the increased rent of 25 times from March in September. In the same neighborhood, regardless of the quality of the houses, some increased by 70 times, some by 60 times, and some by 16 or 17 times. Is this legal? — In summary of the above two points, I humbly request the wise and virtuous Standing Bureau to pay attention to this and have a proper solution.

Since Mr. Wu does not have this proof, he cannot participate in the admission examination." Further reply to Mr. Wang: "Regarding the rumors of cheating, the university has published a notice in your newspaper on September 25.

### Diplomatic Center of Gravity to Shift to New York; Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be Held on November 1st; Chinese Delegation to UN General Assembly Departs India for US

[United Press, London, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson announced today that the Four-Power talks will be held "formally" on the luxury liner "Aquitania," which is scheduled to carry the delegates of various countries to New York in the last week of October. It is reported that the only one confirmed to be traveling to New York on the ship is British Foreign Secretary Bevin. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is expected to leave Southampton on Wednesday aboard the "Queen Elizabeth." US Secretary of State Byrnes plans to fly to Washington. French Prime Minister Bidault may not be able to depart for a while due to the elections and will fly to New York later. The "Aquitania" is expected to leave Southampton on October 27, which means it will arrive in New York ten days after the opening of the UN General Assembly.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 13th] The Chinese delegation to the UN General Assembly is scheduled to leave here for New York this afternoon. The delegation met with Nehru here.

[Report] San Francisco, 13th Radio: The Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly left India today and flew to New York.

[Reuters, New York, 13th] The UN General Assembly will soon open in New York. The UN Secretariat has booked 100 rooms in various hotels for the delegations of various countries to settle in. However, the Foreign Ministers' Conference is also scheduled to be held in New York on November 1, so the US government, in its capacity as host, has booked another 50 rooms in various hotels for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers and their staff to reside in. The location of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is in downtown New York City, while the old site of the UN General Assembly is the old site of the World's Fair in Long Island. The meeting place for the various committees is at Success Lake, about six miles from there. Many officials agree to use the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel as the meeting place for the Four Powers. One or two of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers may reside in that hotel. The government is planning not only for the accommodation of the various representatives but also for office space. The British delegations to the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council were the first to request a portion of the 1233rd floor of the Empire State Building as office space. The ordinary residents of the building have all moved out and are dedicated to the representatives attending the UN General Assembly. One British representative said that half of the members of my delegation sit on charity beds all day working, and those who sit in the office are almost knee-to-knee.

### Peace Conference Passes Treaty with Hungary; Decides to Convene Danube River Conference

[Report] London, 13th Radio: The Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to close on the evening of the 15th. [United Press, Paris, 13th] The Peace Conference has completed all discussions on the Treaty with Hungary last night and is scheduled to begin discussing the Treaty with Finland next Monday. The terms of the Treaty with Hungary, which were passed last night, also stipulate freedom of navigation on the Danube River, the same as the Treaties with Romania and Bulgaria.

[French News Agency, 13th] The Peace Conference held a plenary meeting yesterday to review the Treaty with Hungary. France proposed convening an international conference of the Four Powers and the countries of the Danube River basin to discuss the issue of free navigation on the Danube River, which was passed by a two-thirds majority. At the same time, most of the political and territorial clauses of the Treaty with Hungary were quickly passed without discussion. Regarding the economic clauses, the clause regarding the Soviet Union's right to manage German-owned assets within Hungary was unanimously passed by the entire assembly.

[United Press, Paris, 12th] The plenary meeting of the Peace Conference today discussed the clauses of the Treaty with Hungary regarding reparations to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, which stipulated a total amount of 300 million US dollars. The United States proposed reducing it to 200 million US dollars, which was rejected by a vote of twelve to two. The original proposal was maintained. Only Canada supported the US proposal, and seven other countries abstained. The Peace Conference also passed other clauses stipulating that Hungary and Czechoslovakia should negotiate the issue of the withdrawal of 200,000 Hungarian minority people from the Czech border. Hungary should also cede three cities near the Danube River bank to Czechoslovakia to expand the province of Bratislava. Finally, military clauses were passed, limiting the Hungarian army to 65,000 men and the air force to 70 fighter jets, 20 transport aircraft, and 5,000 air force personnel. The General Assembly has completed the work of the eleventh week to date. There are four meetings left before the recess. There will be a recess on Sunday the 13th. Three meetings will be held on the 14th to pass the Treaty with Finland. The closing ceremony will be held on the 15th. All the above meetings will be presided over by French President and Foreign Minister Bidault.

### Organizing International Forces: The Soviet Union Has Not Refused

[Agencia France-Presse, Succes Lake, 13th] According to a representative of France at the United Nations Military Staff Committee, the Soviet Union has not completely refused to participate in the establishment of an international peacekeeping force, as some American newspapers have claimed. The Soviet delegation submitted a memorandum to the United Nations Staff Committee stating that the Soviet Union refused to declare the number of troops it would contribute to the international peacekeeping force until a real international crisis arose that required intervention by such a force. This proves that the Soviet Union has not completely rejected the plans proposed by China, the United States, Britain, and France. It is reported that the four countries have already provided the Staff Committee with all the necessary information for its future work, while the Soviet Union has only provided the first part of its information, without indicating the troops it would deploy or how they would be allocated. However, negotiations are frequently held between the Soviet delegation and other delegations, and a compromise may be possible.

### The Price of Peace

An Account from the French Foreign Ministry

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The accounts of the French Foreign Ministry show that the price of peace is 1,300,585 yuan. In the two and a half months since the conference began, the French government has spent an average of 10,170 yuan per day on behalf of the representatives of twenty-one countries.

### The Soviet Union Promotes the Five-Year Plan, Actively Preparing for a New War: Former Soviet Metal Factory Director Writes in British Newspaper

[Reuters, London, 13th] Kravchenko, who announced his defection from the Soviet Communist Party in the United States two years ago, wrote an article in the London Sunday newspaper "World News," accusing Stalin of doing his best to prepare for a new war within the next generation. Kravchenko was originally the director and chief engineer of a Soviet metal factory, and he went to the United States to order goods. He recently published a book entitled "I Chose Freedom." In his article published in the newspaper today, he said: Stalin not only believes that there is a threat of a new war, but his government is also doing its best to prepare for this war, and its entire diplomatic and domestic policies can prove this.

Completion of Atomic Armaments is Only a Matter of Time

The purpose of the Soviet Union's Fourth Five-Year Plan is to increase its defense capabilities and equip the Red Army with the latest scientific technology. It is planned that by 1950, the production of its war machinery will increase fivefold. In addition to the ordnance department, a special department has been established to start building army and navy factories. There is no doubt that Stalin will be able to complete atomic armaments. All of this will defend the Soviet Union against whom? He does not use the national treasury to relieve the people's post-war suffering, but instead makes them more impoverished. What is his motive? Stalin blames others for the current war atmosphere, adopts Hitler's methods, blames Britain and the United States for his own actions, and shouts that British and American imperialism threatens the Soviet Union with a new war. Are they not political gamblers in the Kremlin?

Adopting Hitler's Methods to Achieve Political Goals

The purpose of this policy of the Soviet government is (1) to intimidate the Allies and engage in a war of nerves in order to obtain the maximum political and military concessions; (2) to prove to its own people the need for its large-scale military expansion plan; (3) to make the Soviet army firmly believe in the necessity of maintaining arms. Stalin's words and heart are contradictory, and his words and deeds are inconsistent. His purpose is to deceive Western countries. He conceals his political and military goals in Germany in order to deceive public opinion. He knows very well that a battle is currently underway to politically occupy Germany, and the result will affect the increase or decrease of his power in Europe. At the same time, large-scale purges are being carried out in Ukraine, Moscow, and Leningrad in the Soviet Union, and all those suspected of sympathizing with the West, neglecting Marxism, or his personal doctrines are being purged. Stalin knows very well that the atomic bomb is an important weapon, and no military secrets must be allowed to be known to Stalin, otherwise his goal of world revolution can really be realized.

The Dissolution of the Comintern is Completely a Smokescreen

The dissolution of the Communist International is completely a smokescreen. The policies of the Politburo are exactly the same as those of the Communist International. France's Thorez and Marty, Romania's Pauker, Hungary's Erno Gero, Italy's Togliatti, Bulgaria's Dimitrov and Kolarov, and Germany's Pieck are all implementing the Politburo's policies. They are its plenipotentiaries and listen to its commands. When considering their relationship with each other and with the Soviet Union, Western countries should not forget this fact, that in Stalin's eyes, today's England and its vigorous promotion of social reform are his number one enemy in terms of ideology and politics. Britain and the United States should abandon their prejudices and jointly strive for the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and become the spiritual support of other governments and peoples.

### The Resolution on Returning to the Muslim League Is Conveyed to the Viceroy of India

The Content is Not Revealed

[United Press, New Delhi, 13th] Muslim League Secretary Ali Khan claimed today that the Muslim League Standing Committee has reached a resolution on whether to participate in the Indian independence plan, but refused to reveal the nature of the resolution. The Muslim League leader Jinnah has been asked to convey this resolution to the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, and it is expected that the Viceroy will make an announcement as a result. New Delhi newspapers generally expect that although direct negotiations between the Congress Party and the Muslim League have broken down, the Muslim League will still participate in the independence plan based on the conditions negotiated with Wavell. If it does not succeed, it will file a lawsuit with the United Nations.

### Egyptian Prime Minister to Fly to Britain on Wednesday to Discuss Treaty Revision Issues

If it does not succeed, it will file a lawsuit with the United Nations

[Reuters, Cairo, 12th] Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky will lead Senate President, Free Party leader Hafez Ramadan Pasha, Saadi Party leader Nokrashy Pasha, and Foreign Minister Hafez Ramadan Pasha to London on the 16th to meet with British Foreign Secretary Bevin to discuss the revision of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Egyptian newspapers also said that if the trip to London fails, Sidky will immediately fly to the United States to present the Egyptian issue to the United Nations.

### The United States Plans to Set Up a Rocket Test Range, Britain is Also Conducting Secret Experiments, with the Farthest Range Able to Cross Half of Australia

[United Press, South Yanton, 12th] Senator Gona of this state said today that he had received a phone call from Washington, learning that the government is planning to set up a test range, employing 36,000 people, to study rocket bombs, supersonic aircraft, and atomic energy. Survey teams are surveying the site of the test range. Military authorities will request funds from Congress next spring to carry out the project. The test range covers an area of fifty square miles and requires a large amount of electricity.

[Central News Agency, London, 12th, United Press] The Ministry of Supply announced today that a team of ten people led by Lieutenant General Eves has been selected to test secret rocket weapons, whose range is the farthest in the world, which will cross half of Australia and enter the Pacific Ocean. The Ministry of Supply estimates that the initial stage of this work will cost 50 million US dollars, and another 12 million US dollars will be spent a year later.

### Japan Attempts to Acquire Ryukyu, Politicians Privately Exchange Secret Documents, Confidently Believing That War Will Inevitably Break Out Between the United States and the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 12th] Japanese politicians are now privately exchanging a shocking document totaling seven pages, which explains Japan's future goals for the peace treaty with Japan. The document does not stipulate any specific clauses, but only reveals some guiding principles to enable the Japanese delegation attending the peace conference to follow. The document proposes inserting two special clauses in the preamble to the draft peace treaty with Japan: (1) condemning the right to make war, to show Japan's peaceful intentions, and (2) recognizing the equality of all races. Japan once advocated racial equality before the Versailles Peace Conference; as for territorial issues, Japan intends to obtain the trusteeship of the Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa Island), because the islands have close ties with Japan in terms of tradition, race, and culture. No suggestions were made regarding the Kuril Islands, only stating that the issue of fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters requires Japanese diplomats to use all means. Japanese politicians have had mixed reactions to this document; however, most believe that it is inappropriate to insert clauses condemning the right to make war into international treaties. A senior politician told this agency's reporter: It is enough for us to insert clauses condemning the right to make war into the constitution, because war will inevitably break out between the United States and the Soviet Union in the future, so it is meaningless for us to insert such clauses into the treaty. The general political circles also believe that the issue of racial equality is inappropriate. If the Soviet Union agrees with this theory, other countries will inevitably rise up in opposition, and the result will be to make the Soviet Union ostensibly a protector of Asian nations, but in reality expand its power in the Far East. Japanese politicians unanimously agree that Japan should at least be able to acquire the Ryukyu Islands, and leave Okinawa Island to the United States as a military base.

### Columbus Day: Franco's Speech

[United Press, Madrid, 13th] Franco delivered a Columbus Day speech today, stating that the Spanish government's policy is based on respect for the law, and "all tyranny is hateful, but tyranny from abroad is the most vicious." Spain has close ties with the Americas in the "spiritual realm." During this war, the government kept Spain out of the conflict. While other countries were at war, Spain made progress in both science and society.

### French Referendum: Deciding the Fate of the New Draft Constitution

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The French referendum on the new constitution began this morning in a harmonious atmosphere. Because it was a Sunday, the residents of Paris got up later. After getting up, they went directly to the polling stations to vote. To save procedures, voters only need to show their ID and election certificate. While voting was in progress, masses were being held in various churches, and voters from various churches gathered to discuss politics with great enthusiasm. Patients in the hospital either sat in wheelchairs or were helped by attendants to go to the polling stations to vote, while other patients used absentee voting methods. President Bidault voted at a polling station near the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building this morning. The president looked like an ordinary citizen, without guards, and smiled as he passed through the voter queue and put his ballot into the box. The situation in Marseille was not enthusiastic. As of 10:00 a.m., only 44,815 of the 315,000 voters had voted. During the voting in June, the same time had 70,400 people voting.

### Truman to Announce New Economic Stabilization Plan

### US Government Sends Note to Soviet Union, Demanding Settlement of Lend-Lease Funds for Military Equipment; British-Soviet Trade Negotiations Underway in London

### The Normalization and Righteousness of Japan's Diet (Part 1)

[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 12th] The Japanese Diet is about to adjourn, and local elections are imminent. The Japanese political scene is gradually becoming active, and what the Japanese call the political season is about to begin. Recently, the most noteworthy aspect of the Japanese political scene is the concrete manifestation of the grand unity of conservative forces. The merger movement of the Liberal and Progressive parties and the rightward leaning of the Socialist Party all show that the task of political parties is to maintain the established political order, uphold vested rights and obligations, and represent a social group with an established power base. The basic form of Japanese society is capitalism; the fundamental mission of Japanese politics is to maintain the development of capitalism; but Japanese capitalism cannot overcome the original feudal productive relations, and has been closely connected with militarism since the Meiji Restoration, and its regressive nature has become increasingly strong. Although Japan has implemented parliamentary politics, it has not yet fully developed and is often restricted by militarism; therefore, the policies of established political parties are often wavering and unable to fulfill their historical mission, that is, unable to complete the democratic revolution in the capitalist stage. The historical task originally shouldered by the Liberal Party was the realization of democratic freedom. Although the Liberal Party once declared that freedom is the nature of man and maintaining freedom is the way of mankind, the Liberal Party's claims regarding the national polity openly support the existence of the Emperor system. When the Diet deliberated on the constitution, it unanimously advocated with the Progressive Party that the constitution should stipulate that the Emperor be the head of state. In other words, the sovereignty should belong to the Emperor. Although the Liberal Party once pretended to be democratic, it claimed in its emergency policy statement in November last year that war criminals should be severely punished, but the former president of the party, Ichiro Hatoyama, was on MacArthur's purge list, so he had no choice but to remove the president to serve as a shield. When the Diet opened, the constitutional expert Ozaki Yukio strongly scolded the Self-Defense Party for this move, believing that it was close to being dispatched. Amidst the current calls from the people for the realization of the party system, the Liberal Party actually pulled a bureaucrat who did not occupy a seat in the Diet to take over as president. It can be seen that the established political parties in Japan have no integrity, which fully demonstrates the regressive nature of Japanese politics. As for the Progressive Party, it is nothing more than an alias for the wartime Taisei Yokusankai and the Japanese Political Association. The constituent elements are mostly members of the Seiyukai and the Minseito. In the Seiyukai, there are people such as Nakajima Chikuhei of the Nakajima faction and Kuhara Fusanosuke of the Kuhara faction. In the past, the Minseito and the Seiyukai were originally incompatible, but in the history of Japanese political parties, it is not uncommon for two opposing political parties to mutually recommend pingfa [a term referring to people from the Mitsui or Mitsubishi zaibatsu] as party leaders and merge. For example, Okuma's Kaishinto and Itagaki's Jiyuto. The Liberal Party cooperated with Ito Hirobumi to establish the Seiyukai, while the Kaishinto joined the ranks of Katsura Taro to form the Doshikai, the successor of which was the Minseito. These two political parties were unable to purely grasp the political parties from the standpoint of the people's party, and they changed their stance midway. Another example is the Seiyukai, which once held the power by opposing the guanfa [bureaucratic clique] and the junfa [military clique], with Ito Hirobumi, Saionji Kinmochi, Hara Takashi, Takahashi Korekiyo, Tanaka Giichi, Inukai Tsuyoshi, and Suzuki Kisaburo as party leaders. The Minseito once held power with Katsura Taro, Kato Takaaki, Uchida Kosai, Hamaguchi Osachi, and Machida Chuji as party leaders. As a result, Japanese democracy and parliamentary politics have often been distorted because political parties compromise with hanbatsu [feudal clan cliques] and guanfa. The Progressive Party's recommendation of Shidehara as the leader of the Liberal Party is nothing more than a tactic of the regressive political history of Japan. The purpose of the Progressive Party in recommending Shidehara as the party leader is to use Shidehara's bureaucratic status to gain power; but this move unfortunately failed, so they turned to cooperate with the Liberal Party, recommending cabinet members to the Yoshida cabinet, and becoming Yoshida's ally party, so the Yoshida cabinet is also known as the Second Shidehara Cabinet. It can be said that the main body of the political parties supporting the Yoshida cabinet is actually the Progressive Party, not the Liberal Party, because the Yoshida cabinet is essentially a bureaucratic cabinet, not a political party cabinet. In the era of militarism, Japan welcomed the military cliques and allowed them to run rampant, which was exactly what these politicians, the predecessors of the Progressive Party, did. Historical facts clearly show us that when the September 18th Incident occurred, Shidehara was the Foreign Minister in the Minseito cabinet at the time. One year before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, that is, in 1935, the Nakajima and Kuhara factions of the Minseito and the Seiyukai were willing to dissolve their own political parties and participate in the fascist system of the military and the bureaucracy. During the Hirota cabinet, these politicians colluded with bureaucrats and agreed to allow active military personnel to serve as ministers. During the Konoe cabinet's New System political movement, these politicians applauded and praised the military's dictatorial politics in the Diet, and all participated in the plan to invade China.

The Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Wataru Hashimoto, made a fortune during the war by running the Peiping Hotel in Peiping. It is said that most of the Liberal Party's funds were provided by him. Ichiro Hatoyama, the former president of the Liberal Party, suppressed speech during his tenure as the Minister of Education in 1933, and dismissed Takigawa Yukitoki, a professor at Kyoto Imperial University who opposed military training. There is no disparity between the social groups represented by the Liberal and Progressive parties and the policies they advocate. They all lie in the protection of the national polity; in other words, they maintain and uphold the interests of established forces, and when the Yoshida cabinet was established, it owed a lot to Shidehara. Yoshida's cabinet formation staff was served by Shidehara's confidant, former State Minister Ishiguro Takeshige. The cabinet includes Kawai Yoshinari (Minister of Health), Shidehara Kijuro (State Minister), Saito Takao (State Minister), and Ichimatsu Sadayoshi (Minister of Communications) from the Progressive Party. The emergence of the Yoshida cabinet can be said to be the result of black market transactions between the Liberal and Progressive parties. The social groups represented by the Yoshida cabinet are exactly the same as those represented by the Progressive Party, still backed by senior ministers, bureaucrats, and the privy council. The central figures of the bureaucratic forces include Izawa Takio, Matsudaira Tsuneo, Suzuki Kantaro, Okada Keisuke, Yonai Mitsumasa, Mitsuchi Chuzo, Wakatsuki Reijiro, Ikeda Seihin, and his father-in-law Makino Nobuaki. Although they are of the Tojo faction, they were still speculators during the war.

### Another Woman Murdered in Nanshi: Found in Front of the Shanghai Garrison Railway Station; Circumstances Resembling the Xin Xian Lane Tragedy of Two Weeks Ago; Speculation Suggests Rape and Murder; Police Bureau Offers Reward for Strict Investigation

[This Newspaper's Report] On the 24th of last month, a case of a murdered female corpse occurred in Xin Xian Lane in Nanshi, which remains unsolved. Unexpectedly, before many days had passed, another similar tragedy occurred yesterday. The details are as follows:

Yesterday morning at approximately 7:00 AM, a woman was discovered murdered on the road in front of the Shanghai Garrison Railway Station in Nanshi, specifically on the wasteland where the old South District Fire Brigade used to be. The woman's body was lying face up on the lawn. Upon hearing the news, crowds rushed to the scene to observe. After being discovered by Police Officer Song Jinchao of the Shanghai Garrison Police Station, he immediately reported the situation to the Penglai Police Bureau. Yao Qihong, the head of the branch bureau, personally led Criminal Section Chief Yao Yuanlong, along with section members Wu Zhipeng, Police Chief Zhang Shusheng, and Tong Borong, to rush to the scene for investigation. The murdered woman appeared to be only 24 or 25 years old, of ordinary appearance, with her head pointing east and her feet west. Most of her face was found to be bluish-purple, her short hair was disheveled, and white foam was coming from her mouth. She was wearing a checkered qipao made of floral foreign cloth, with a white silk undershirt underneath, red striped short pants made of foreign cloth, and flesh-colored silk stockings. Her face was covered with mud stains, and one of her leather shoes was missing. The other leather shoe was found thrown near a telephone pole about thirty yards away from the body, with the words "Dechanglong Shoe Store" branded inside. Around the corpse's neck was a small blue handkerchief, and outside of that was a black and white polka-dotted net-like kerchief used for carrying things. After a long examination by the police officers, a ring mark was found on the ring finger of her left hand, but the ring was missing. Two buttons on the qipao were unbuttoned, the white undershirt was pulled up, and her breasts were exposed. There were signs of kicking injuries on both sides of her genitals. Next to the corpse was a mud pit three or four inches deep. According to general speculation, she was likely raped before being murdered. The method of murder was probably to forcefully press the woman's face into the mud, suffocating her, and then deliberately tying a handkerchief around the deceased's neck. It can also be concluded that the ring the deceased was wearing was robbed by the murderer afterward. Based on the above examination and judgment, this case undoubtedly involves prior rape, followed by murder, and then robbery of property. However, since the deceased did not have a National Identity Card with her, her name and address could not be ascertained. As of last night, no family members had come to the police station to claim the body. After receiving the report, the General Bureau immediately dispatched personnel from the Criminal Police Division to take photographs and fingerprint the deceased for family identification. In the afternoon, the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, and the court will be requested to conduct an examination this morning. After Branch Bureau Chief Yao Qihong returned to the bureau, due to the continuous occurrence of two bizarre female corpse cases in the jurisdiction within the past two weeks, he summoned the police officers of the Criminal Section and strictly instructed them to investigate the cases and set a deadline for solving them. He also offered a substantial reward to encourage the purchase of clues, so as to bring the murderer to justice for investigation.

### Substitute Senators Organize an Anti-Traitor Association: Will Host Reporters Today to Make a Statement

In recent days, there have been widespread rumors that the Substitute Senators Liaison Association has reported eleven senators on suspicion of being traitors. However, to date, the person in charge of the association, Mr. Wei Yunong, has still stated that the association has never proactively conducted reporting work in the name of the organization in the past. However, the association has recently decided to organize an Anti-Traitor Committee to assist citizens in carrying out anti-traitor work. As for reporting several city senators suspected of being traitors, it is only one part of the committee's work.

The memorial service for the late He Bingsong, president of National Jinan University, was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Zhonghua Xueyi Society on Shaoxing Road. More than five hundred prominent figures from all walks of life attended. A portrait of Mr. He was hung in the center of the altar, with many elegiac couplets hanging beside it. The elegiac couplet from Minister Chen Lifu read, "Trace the origins back to Lize, rise up and revitalize the dying cause of Beishan; diligently write until twilight years, suddenly return to Tusita, losing this scholar." Innumerable elegiac banners and couplets covered the four walls.

### Managing Jinan University Was Hard Work

The memorial service was chaired by a presidium consisting of Pan Gongzhan, Li Zhaoshi, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Ou Yuanhuai, Liu Baimin, Du Zuozhou, Zhang Yi, Zai Zhuyi, Zhou Changshou, and others. After Pan led the memorial ceremony, he delivered a speech on the spot, praising He's lifelong spirit of engaging in education and cultural work, as well as his contributions to the education and academic circles in our country. He also praised the value of the Chinese Indigenous Culture Declaration published by He and other ten professors in the history of Chinese culture.

Then, Wang Zhuyi, a representative of the Shanghai Alumni Association of Jinan University, delivered a speech, expressing infinite admiration for He's extreme hard work in managing the affairs of Jinan University for eleven years. He also paid the utmost respect for He's planning of Jinan University's relocation to the interior during the War of Resistance to avoid being controlled by the enemy and puppets, and to continue singing in Fujian. He also hoped that the students of Jinan University would diligently follow He's instructions during his lifetime to comfort his spirit. Then, students from Jinan University and teachers and students from the Cultural Middle School offered public sacrifices. Finally, He De Kui, He's nephew, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the family, and the service ended at 4:00 PM.

### Police Dog Training Completed: Assist in Inspecting Drug Dealers

The City Police Bureau, recognizing that there are still many drug traffickers and that they often use ingenious methods to evade the eyes and ears of inspectors, established a police dog training class with eighty German Shepherds received from the enemy and puppets, and hired experts to complete the training. The trained police dogs have particularly sensitive senses of smell, and even if drug traffickers use cunning methods, it will be difficult for them to escape the police dogs' sense of smell. The City Police Bureau has now distributed the dogs to twenty-eight branch bureaus, and they will immediately accompany the police bureau's inspectors to conduct inspections at various transportation hubs.

### Outdoor Exposed Colored Lights Are Also Prohibited

Since the prohibition of outdoor neon lights, general merchants have replaced them with sunlight-colored lights, which consume even more electricity than neon lights, greatly violating the principle of saving electricity. According to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau, since outdoor neon lights are prohibited, all outdoor decorative lights are also prohibited. If there is any deliberate violation, the same measures will be taken as for those who install outdoor neon lights.

### Ship Oil Pipes Stolen: Two Thieves Arrested

[This Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yongfu Steamboat and Oil Tanker No. 104 were both docked at the Laobaitu Wharf. At 2:00 PM on the 5th, the Oil Tanker No. 104 was suddenly stolen of an oil pipe by "water rats" in the Huangpu River. On the night of the 9th, the Yongfu Steamboat was also stolen of eight oil pipes at night. The total value of the two incidents was over 10 million yuan. The incidents were reported to the Maritime Police Bureau for investigation. Director Wu immediately ordered Section Chief Sun Fang and Police Chief Tang Wanjin, among others, to investigate. It was learned that the oil pipes were sold to a second-hand shop near the Old North Gate and two places in Gujialong on Beijing Road. Subsequently, the receiver of stolen goods, Qian Si, was arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. Based on his confession, two accomplices, Xu Guiting and Xu Zhengzi, were also arrested. It was also revealed that the thieves were hiding in Pudong, Nanshi. Police went to those addresses and arrested Liu Xiaowuzi and Jiang Asan, both from Jiangbei. The masterminds, Wang Huailiang and Zhou, are still at large and are currently being strictly pursued.

### White Powder King Arrested: Large Quantities of Morphine Confiscated

[This Newspaper's Report] The Zhongzheng West Road Police Station of the Changning Road Police Bureau arrested drug dealer Shen Yingbin (47 years old, from Baoding, Hebei, nicknamed "White Powder King") at No. 19 Xibin, Jiangsu Road, at 1:00 AM yesterday morning, and confiscated more than ten packets of morphine.

### All High-Type Public Buses to Be Completely Overhauled

The Public Works Bureau believes that the high-type public buses with doors at the rear, which operate on routes 4 and 5, need to be improved and renovated, such as: (1) The body is heavy and cumbersome, and the ride is bumpy. (2) The doors are at the rear, which is not only inconvenient for passengers to get on and off, but also prevents the driver from responding. (3) The roof leaks. It is reported that the bureau has decided to improve the above points. Of the thirty-eight trucks purchased by the Bureau of Materials Supply, ten have been renovated and are running on Route 7. The remaining twenty-eight will be completed in the shortest possible time and first transferred to Routes 4 and 5 for replacement. At the same time, all high-type vehicles will be completely overhauled.

### The Number of Military Personnel Riding Without Tickets on Both Railways is Increasing Daily: Revised Regulations; Strictly Prohibit Forcibly Occupying Seats; Officially Implemented Starting Today

According to news from the two railway bureaus, the number of military personnel riding without tickets has been increasing daily recently. Although measures for military personnel riding for free have been drafted, and the train schedules for military personnel riding without tickets have been stipulated, there are still some military personnel who do not comply with the regulations and ride the trains, and even forcibly occupy seats on designated trains such as the Triumph and Taihu trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line and the Jinling and West Lake trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. As a result, disputes occur from time to time, which greatly affects traffic order and passenger safety, resulting in delays and cancellations of trains, which are heard of daily. According to recent statistics, there are an average of about 4,500 military personnel riding without tickets on the Beijing-Shanghai line every day, and up to 5,500 on the busiest days. There are about 700 military personnel riding without tickets on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line every day, and up to 1,600 on the busiest days, accounting for one-tenth of the total number of passengers on both railways, which greatly affects the railway bureau's revenue. This figure does not include military personnel riding without tickets in accordance with the regulations. When General Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, came to Shanghai a few days ago, the person in charge of the bureau went to see him and reported the situation in detail. General Tang promised to take measures to ban this practice. In order to facilitate military personnel riding without tickets, the bureau has simplified the procedures for riding and revised the train schedules for riding to: Trains 51 to 54 and 57 and 58 on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and trains 41, 42, 61, 62, 67, and 68 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, which are marked with "Military Personnel Seating Cars," allow active-duty military personnel to ride for free with their leave permits endorsed by the station military police. In addition, military personnel are specially allowed to purchase "half-price military tickets" with type A train passes or leave permits on trains 5 to 12 (except for sleepers) and 73 to 80 on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and trains 23, 25, 26, 92, and 94 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Military personnel are absolutely prohibited from occupying seats without tickets on all trains other than the above-mentioned trains. The above measures will be officially implemented starting today.

### The Public Works Bureau's Two Transportation Agencies Will Hold Joint Weekly Meetings and Change Their Names

Since the establishment of the Public Works Bureau's Tram Company Preparatory Office, it has actively carried out investigation and statistical work. Now, in order to meet the needs, seek closer contact with the routes operated by public buses, and simplify matters, the above agencies will be merged with the Public Bus Preparatory Committee and renamed the Shanghai Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee. This decision has been approved at the Public Works Bureau's weekly meeting last week, and it will be implemented as soon as Mayor Wu approves it. It is also learned that Director Zhao Zengyu of the bureau will serve as the chairman of the committee, with Zhang Mingtao as his deputy.

### Amidst the Influx of American Films, "China Electric" Strives to Revitalize: Two New Films to Be Completed Next Month

The Central Film Studio's first feature film after the victory, "The House of Loyalty," directed by Wu Yonggang and starring Liu Qiong and Qin Yi, played to full houses at the Shanghai Grand Theater for a month. At a time when foreign films are flooding our country's market, it is undoubtedly a great encouragement to domestic films. Luo Xuelian, the person in charge of the studio, is actively planning to order all film studios to speed up film production. Here is a report on the recent situation of each studio: The "China Electric" First Studio, located on Tiantong'an Road in Shanghai, is headed by Qiu Yiwei as the factory director and mainly focuses on the production of newsreels and documentaries. The studio has the best technical equipment, and Tang Huang is dedicated to the editing of newsreels and documentaries, producing about six newsreels and documentaries every month. Completed documentaries include "Agriculture is the Foundation of the Country," "Lively Early Summer," "The True Face of Mount Lu," "The Portrait of Chairman Chiang," "Fledgling Eagles," and "North and South of the Tianshan Mountains." The numbered newsreels have already been released from No. 120 to No. 149. Among them, the special newsreels such as "Japanese Surrender Ceremony," "Chairman Chiang Returns to Nanjing," "Trial of Traitor Chen Gongbo," "Trial of Chen Bijun and Chu Minyi," "Triumphant Return to the Capital," and "The Hunan Disaster" are the most historically valuable. The "Shanghai Window" is specially included in the general numbered newsreels, using the activities of Shanghai as materials, with various aspects. Recently, there are also plans to mix and edit newsreels and documentaries into magazine films, including "Modern Life" and "European and American Styles." The studio is also increasing equipment and shooting feature-length films. Factory Director Qiu Yiwei and Director Tang Huang are actively promoting this. It is expected that two to three feature films will be completed within half a year. The "China Electric" Second Studio is located on Jianguo West Road in Shanghai, headed by Xu Suling as the factory director. In addition to "The House of Loyalty," which has already been released, the new films "Distant Love" (directed by Chen Liting, starring Zhao Dan and Qin Yi) and "Flying to the World" (directed by Fang Peilin, starring Ouyang Feiying) can all be completed by the end of next month. Films that are being actively planned for shooting include: (1) "Man and Rat" (directed by Wu Yonggang, starring Jin Yan and Liu Qiong). (2) "Returning Home in Glory" (directed by Zhao Danxian, starring Lu Ming). (3) "Loyal Souls in the Wilderness" (directed by Ma Xu Bang, starring Yuan Rumei). (4) "Dream of the Red Chamber" (directed by Xu Changlin and Zhao Dan, starring Lu Ming). (5) "Madame So-and-So" (directed by Xu Suling, starring Shu Xiuwen). (6) "Moon Over the Forbidden City" (directed by Fang Peilin). The "China Electric" Third Studio is located in Peiping, headed by Xu Angqian as the factory director. In addition to producing feature films, the studio also produces newsreels and documentaries. Completed newsreels and documentaries, such as "Peiping Surrender Ceremony," "Chairman Chiang Arrives in Peiping," and "Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners" are all filmed in a timely manner and have now been released to No. 14. Each issue has one or two copies (each copy is about a thousand feet long). In addition to "The Holy City Story" (directed by Shen Xue, starring Bai Yang and Xie Tian), which will be completed recently, "Returning Home" directed by Tu Guangqi has recently started shooting. Under preparation are "Unforgettable Life" directed by Shen Fu, "Ode to a Kind Mother" directed by Wu Yonggang, and "Peking Man" directed by Zhang Junxiang. The North China film scene is also gradually entering a period of prosperity.

### Desolate, Lonely, and Miserable: The "New Shanghai" After the Calamity; The Dream of Construction of That Year Shattered; Hope Everyone Works Hard to Piece It Together Again

[Special Feature from This Newspaper] Building a new Shanghai has always been a beautiful dream. When the shadow of the dream had just begun to materialize on the ground, the enemy's artillery fire shattered it. Yesterday afternoon, the autumn light was just right, and reporters and others drove to find this shattered dream, but the scenery was no longer the same, and the former glory could not be pieced together no matter what.

An American soldier sat alone on the lawn behind the "Shanghai Special Municipality Government" building, staring blankly at the carvings under the eaves, as if lost in thought. A little further on, several of our brothers were watching this foreign comrade with interest and surprise. They lived in this building, which was damaged inside and had broken glass windows. They didn't understand what was so good about it.

When the reporter approached the American soldier, he turned his head and greeted, saying "It's beautiful!" He was originally a researcher of interior decoration and had a deep love for these purely Eastern patterns. But he mistakenly thought that the former municipal government building was a temple. After the reporter told him, he asked, "Why don't you repair such a beautiful building?" The reporter said, "That would take a lot of money." But the reporter also doubted whether people were still in the mood to piece together this shattered dream today, when the concessions had been recovered.

The Municipal Museum was a major achievement of the municipal government's cultural construction in the past. After its establishment, it was widely collected, attempting to preserve the traces of human activity here. What is left today is only the traces of destruction. Not only was it damaged by the enemy, but it also had the ominous traces left by our own people. Since the victory, it has been taken over many times, and some troops cut down trees indoors because of a lack of firewood. In the past, people cut down trees to build houses, but today everyone cuts down houses to make fires. Is this how times are progressing?

Now, the officers and soldiers of the 7th Company of the Lunqi Second Regiment live downstairs here. Although they tried their best to repair it, they could not repair it due to limited funds. The upstairs is all empty, deserted, and silent, as if stepping into a haunted house in a detective novel. In the misery, it seemed that there was a sound of crying from the corners of the roof pillars.

The gymnasium has been sealed off. Light and heavy explosives are stored inside. The doors on all four sides are either blocked by barbed wire or guarded by guards.

But the Municipal Hospital is actively operating. Now it is the Shanghai Army Hospital and Military Medical School of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. The enemy's army hospital was also here in the past, and they added many houses and equipment. After we took over, we improved it. At the same time, there are many new plans being actively implemented!

As for the beautiful residences of the new Shanghai in the past, they can no longer be seen. Most of the few remaining small foreign-style houses are also damaged with broken doors and windows.

The dream of building a new Shanghai in the past is completely shattered! But I hope everyone will work hard again and piece it together again.

### Forging Documents and Extorting: Repeated Offenses; Jiang Weilian and Another Accomplice Arrested Yesterday

[This Newspaper's Report] Jiang Weikang (pictured), a native of Anhui, 40 years old, lives at No. 266, Jian'an Road, and is the accounting director of the Shen Ren Zhongxing Construction Export Bank. Recently, he and his colleague Hu Guanghan (24 years old, a native of Shanghai) forged documents, impersonated the name of the Shanghai Garrison Fourth Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, and specialized in extortion. The number of victims before and after is countless. The case was learned by the Penglai Road Branch of the Police Bureau and arrested him at the home of Peng Aqijia, No. 19, Deqing Lane, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi. At the beginning of this month, the two criminals went to Peng's home with a forged approval from the former commander Qian Dajun, saying that he was suspected of privately hiding enemy property and must be taken to the headquarters for investigation. Later, Peng's wife, Caiying, interceded and agreed that if he could pay 2 million yuan, he could be exempted from investigation. Finally, a settlement of 500,000 yuan was agreed upon, and Peng's wife paid it off in two installments. Unexpectedly, the two criminals went to Peng's house again the day before yesterday, saying that the superiors believed that the matter was of great importance and that Peng must personally write a letter to the headquarters. Peng's wife reported to the Penglai Police Bureau because the two criminals repeatedly caused trouble. The chief sent Director Yao Yuanlong, team members Wu Zhipeng, police chief Tong Borong, police officer Fang Gaoshan, Ye Guanbao and others to rush to capture them. Many forged documents were confiscated from the two criminals on the spot, as well as more than forty returned checks from Guanghua Bank, Hetai Bank, and Yuanxiang Money House. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, they confessed that they had resorted to this strategy because their income was insufficient. After investigation by the police bureau, the victims who have been discovered include Wang Zhongyu and Le Mingsheng at No. 3, Tianlefang, Xieqiao Lane. The police bureau has applied for custody, and it is hoped that the victims will report to the bureau so that the case can be handled together.

### Tram Disregards Red Light: Crashes into Truck and Injures People

In addition to the tram driver Guan Youli injuring both hands, passengers Guo Shuchun and conductor Shun Erren were seriously injured in the head. The truck that was hit was a No. 35032 cargo truck owned by Huaxing Company at No. 39, Zhongzheng East Road, fortunately without any major problems. The cause of the accident was that the driver of the tram did not pay attention to the red light ahead. After the accident, the police on duty urgently summoned an ambulance to send the injured to Renji and Gongji Hospitals for treatment.

### Two Sailing Boats on the Suzhou Creek: Four Boatmen and Others Kidnapped

[This Newspaper's Report] A week ago, two sailing boats from northern Jiangsu, loaded with 150 bales of cotton, arrived in Shanghai and docked at Wharf No. 18 on the west side of the Sichuan Road Bridge on Suzhou Creek. One day, five or six people in uniforms arrived and, without asking the reason, took away the boatmen Lu Wenxiang, Shi Guoxiang, and the ship officers Huang Boqing and Xiao Huang, accusing them of having some kind of suspicion. Before leaving, they sent two people in plain clothes to stay on the ship to guard it, claiming that they were sent by a certain agency. Afterwards, the cargo owner inquired with a certain agency, and found that there was no such thing, nor was there any kidnapping of the four people. The truth of the case is being thoroughly investigated by the authorities.

### Forgotten Handbag Recovered

Lu immediately telegraphed various stations to search for it. When the car passed through Zhenjiang Station, Stationmaster Ge of the station managed to find it and immediately returned it to the original owner. After checking, nothing was missing.

### Reply to Readers - Legal Questions

(1) Old Love Rekindled

Yang Youwei asks: There are three people, A, B, and C. A is 23 years old, B is 19 years old, and C (female) is 30 years old. B and C cohabited two and a half years ago (without marriage, only B's parents tacitly acknowledged C as their son-in-law). Recently, because B was dissatisfied with C's temperament and often suffered abuse from C, she discussed countermeasures with A (A and B had been in love three years ago, separated for two and a half years, and rekindled their love half a year ago). They got engaged in March of this year and had two engagement papers (each holding one, but B, fearing trouble, stored hers with A). Twelve guests attended the ceremony, and two introducers and two witnesses signed or stamped the papers. Currently, C and B's family know about the situation between A and B (B's family is strongly opposed, but they don't know about the engagement), so the following questions arise. Please answer them:

(1) Has a marital relationship been established between B and C after two and a half years of cohabitation? (2) Can C sue A? (3) Does B's age allow her to have autonomy in marriage? (4) Can B's family sue A? (5) Is the engagement agreement between A and B legally valid? (6) What procedures should A and B follow to get married?

[Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] (1) Since B and C have not formally married, they cannot establish a marital relationship. (2) Since C is not B's husband, he has no right to sue A. (3) B is not yet an adult (20 years old is considered adulthood), so both engagement and marriage should have the consent of her legal guardian. (4) If B has not left her family and gone with A, even if her family sues A, A has no criminal responsibility. (5) See answer to question 3 for details. (6) They should wait until B turns 20 years old and then hold the engagement and marriage ceremony. At that time, even if B's parents oppose or do not act as the officiant, it will not be an obstacle.

(2) Wanton Abuse

Yu Yongfen asks: A relative has a daughter who married last year. Unexpectedly, her husband is naturally unruly, and often abuses and scolds her for trivial matters. Daily life is like sitting on pins and needles. Although she has not suffered violent beatings, her mental suffering has reached its limit. Because it is difficult to grow old together, she returned to her mother's home. Her husband came to take her back, and after her father repeatedly warned him, her husband obediently listened and took her back. However, not long after, the old habits returned, and the abuse continued. Now there are several legal questions, please answer them: (1) Under these circumstances, it is difficult to cohabit. Can the woman file for divorce? (2) Can the woman request alimony? (4) If the man does not agree to a divorce, what should be done?

[Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] (1) Since she has suffered unbearable pain in cohabitation, she can legally divorce. (2) She can request alimony. (3) If both parties cannot agree on a divorce, she can file a lawsuit for divorce in court.

### A Shanghai Transportation Trilogy: Brothel Runner Sitting in Official Sedan, Comparable to the Shanghai Daotai of the Time

In the early days of the Shanghai concession, besides the single-wheeled "goat carts," the more prestigious mode of transportation was the sedan chair. Officialdom traveled exclusively by sedan chair, and the hierarchy was as strict as with mandarin squares and hat knobs. The Shanghai Daotai rode in a large, eight-bearer sedan chair with silk cloth and a golden top. A county magistrate could only use a four-bearer sedan chair with red lacquer, a vermillion top, and blue cloth. Gentry and scholars rode in sedan chairs with ornate tops and inlaid glass, called "sun-shielding sedan chairs." Commoners only rode in small sedan chairs with blue cloth, as did doctors and similar professions.

The bridal sedan chair, used for newly married brides, was the most flamboyant. Many families still use it for weddings today, calling it the "Ningbo colored sedan chair." At that time, flower sedan chairs came in red and green, and one color was chosen based on instructions from the Zhou Tang divination method. The bride sitting in this flower-bedecked sedan chair was full of joy, like a top scholar parading through the streets on horseback!

Convicts being escorted to the execution ground or sent to prison also sat in sedan chairs, a type of small, topless sedan chair. Prostitutes on official errands could ride in green cloth official sedan chairs. Many fast sedan chairs waited at docks and stations, soliciting customers. Sedan chairs were indeed the only mode of transportation at the time. Later, when rickshaws were introduced, the number of sedan chairs on the market gradually decreased. Perhaps the last person in Shanghai to ride in a sedan chair was Zhang Shengsheng, a famous expert in treating typhoid fever. The roads were already full of automobiles, but he still insisted on riding in his sedan chair. To this day, Zhang's descendants still hang this sedan chair in the gatehouse, truly comparable to Zhou Liantang's No. 1 automobile. Sedan chairs were eliminated due to the influence of rickshaws, but they were replaced by horse-drawn carriages. "Hat shadows and whip silks catch the evening sun, faint dust follows the light wheels of the horse-drawn carriage," perfectly representing its status as the "darling" of the time. Officials, foreigners, princes, ladies of the inner chambers, and courtesans all traveled by horse-drawn carriage, becoming a fashion of the time. Riding in a horse-drawn carriage, circling around, and visiting Zhang Garden was the most trendy activity. Even rich old men from the interior would first acquire a horse-drawn carriage.

### Double Horses Side by Side, Eight Hooves Flying; Modern Can Be Called a "Handsome"

Horse-drawn carriages were all modeled after foreign styles, similar to the old mule carts. Carriages were either two-wheeled or four-wheeled, and horses were either single or double. Styles included sedan carriages, covered carriages, and various other types, even ones that were neither sedan nor covered, with an iron pole erected behind the carriage and a canopy attached. The equipment inside the carriage was also very elaborate. Green cloth curtains, white copper spittoons, shiny mirrors, flower vases with silk flowers, fox fur cushions in winter, and white copper hand warmers and foot warmers, filling the carriage with spring warmth despite the wind and snow. The coachman's attire was also specially made, with gauze in summer and a coolie hat, and leather clothing with a cape in winter. Followed by a handsome servant, double horses galloping side by side, eight hooves flying, the scene was full of splendor, flaunting through the city, and passersby would cast sidelong glances. Zheng Rucheng, the garrison commander of Shanghai, was assassinated while riding in a double-horse carriage to visit the consulate on the Waibaidu Bridge.

At that time, families of officials mostly loved to ride in sedan carriages; foreigners, nobles, and courtesans loved to ride in covered carriages, enjoying the freedom to roam and relax. In addition, there was a small horse-drawn carriage with rubber steel wire wheels called a "Handsome," which could be driven by oneself with the reins, riding a famous Arabian horse, which was considered the most modern and was only used by young masters for pleasure rides. Serious people rarely rode in them. During the peak of horse-drawn carriages, there were also carriage rental stables. "Longfei" Carriage was the first brand, located opposite the racetrack at the "International Theater" today. This building has a long and storied history.

### Foreigners' Arrogance: Unequal Treatment in Carriages

At that time, there was also a regulation for driving horse-drawn carriages: all Chinese vehicles were not allowed to overtake foreigners, and foreign vehicles could overtake Chinese vehicles at will. This was also due to the concession authorities' discrimination against the Chinese, like the sign "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed" that used to hang at the entrance of the park. The wealthy Jewish merchant Hardoon had a horse-drawn carriage with red wheels, but at that time in England, only nobles with titles could use "vermilion wheels and ornate hubs." Commoners were prohibited from using them, let alone Hardoon, who was Jewish. Hardoon was fined a lot of money for this carriage. It is said that most of the mahogany-paved road on Nanjing Road was built with Hardoon's fines.

Looking back, how poetic it was to sit in a "Handsome" steel wire horse-drawn carriage in the fading sunset, the sound of hooves echoing, galloping along the edge of the racecourse. The "wheels of time" have eliminated horse-drawn carriages. In the municipal authority's report in 1937, only eight horses and eight carriages remained, filled with feelings of the past and present.

Dozens of horse-drawn carriages still remain in Shanghai today, but they no longer have the elegant scene of galloping around the racecourse in the setting sun. Now, they are just a few old, weak, and emaciated horses picking up and dropping off passengers in front of the North Railway Station to earn a little bit of hard-earned money.

Doesn't this early Shanghai automobile look like a four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage?

### "Strange Howls and Roars While Driving, Randomly Emitting Black Smoke Along the Road"

Automobiles first appeared in Shanghai in the late Qing Dynasty during the Guangxu era. At that time, two foreigners living in Shanghai happened to return to their home countries, learned to drive cars, and found it fresh and interesting. When they returned to China, they brought back two cars. Along the foreign Bund, cars began to drive on the streets, a novelty to behold.

The automobiles of that time had extremely rudimentary structures and very simple mechanisms. The car body was roughly similar to a horse-drawn carriage. The driver sat outside the car compartment, high up as if sitting on the second floor. When the car moved, dust flew. The driver wore work clothes and aviator goggles, taking the matter seriously. At that time, they adjusted the speed on the footboard, and when suddenly stopping, they often became flustered. As for breaking down on the road and being overtaken by horse-drawn carriages, it was not uncommon. Because riding in a car at that time was regarded as a novel game, similar to riding a yacht today, and not solely for transportation purposes.

At that time, the area west of the New World was entirely countryside, and the prosperous area was around the Mud City Bridge. The roads were also relatively wide. Citizens with nothing to do would stand by the roadside to admire the people in the cars. When they saw a "woo, woo, woo" car emitting black smoke drive past, they would shout loudly and clap their hands and laugh. The horse-drawn carriage class at that time could not help but feel a bit jealous of this vehicle that did not require horses. They submitted a joint petition to the Public Works Department to ban it for various reasons: "Strange howls and roars while driving, causing horses and carriages to jump in fright," "Randomly emitting black smoke along the road, hindering hygiene," "Often breaking down midway, obstructing traffic." However, the Public Works Department at that time hoped that there would be a few cars in the concession to embellish and enhance the city's appearance, so they did not act on the horse-drawn carriage class's request for a ban.

### Drivers Were Highly Sought After

Later, as automobiles gradually increased, wealthy families, pursuing fashion, ordered them one after another from foreign countries, and car drivers became highly sought after. Many relatively young coachmen took this opportunity to learn to drive cars. However, the car brands were different, the styles were different, and the driving methods were also different. Car drivers knew one thing but not the other. It was not uncommon for people to buy cars but not know how to drive them, and therefore leave them in the storage of the Longfei car dealership for a year or six months. As for those who knew how to drive cars, regardless of their skills or character, the car owners would pay a considerable price to hire them. However, many wealthy people who bought cars at that time still kept horse-drawn carriages as a backup, showing that they did not fully trust cars.

### Hardoon's Wife Fined for Speeding

Of the first two automobiles to arrive in Shanghai, one was acquired by the wealthy Jewish merchant Hardoon. Hardoon's wife, Luo Jialing, often rode it for fun. However, at that time, the roads were narrow and crowded, and the car drove like a snail, often knocking down pedestrians and bumping into things. The Public Works Department did not know what category to put this new "monster" in. After hesitating for a long time, they decided to levy taxes and issue licenses according to the horse-drawn carriage standards. However, there were no regulations for driving automobiles. Because Hardoon's wife's car caused too many accidents, they extended the measures for banning horse-drawn carriages to automobiles, strictly prohibiting speeding, with a fine of 500 yuan for violators. Hardoon's wife did not care. She carried banknotes with her and drove wildly on Nanjing Road. If a patrolman came forward to interfere, she would immediately pay the fine. The fines were endless, and the patrolmen slowly became indifferent.

### The First Car, the First License Plate

Hardoon cherished this first automobile very much. To preserve the car's history, whenever it was damaged, he would replace the parts and never replace the car with a new one. Before Luo Jialing died, it could still be seen driving slowly through the city. After Hardoon had this first automobile in Shanghai, he hoped to get the first license plate. However, the first license plate had already been donated by Zhou Xiangyun, who was unwilling to show it easily. Therefore, the first car never went out, but he had more than one car, so he could just keep it in the garage. Hardoon once offered a high price to buy it, but Zhou refused. To this day, the first automobile and the first license plate are still stored separately in the garages of the two families in Shanghai.

### Rental Car, 10 Silver Dollars from Haiyin

When automobiles first appeared, only wealthy families could afford to ride in them. In 1916, a retired official and several companions established the Feilong Automobile Company at the former site of the municipal building on Nanjing Road, now the location of the Xinya Restaurant, specializing in rental business, providing rides for people to try, with a price of 10 silver dollars per hour, or a minimum of 6 yuan for half an hour. Although the price was relatively high, because it was a pioneering effort, curious people were happy to try it. This was the beginning of the rental car industry in Shanghai. When the First World War broke out, automobile manufacturing had made further progress. After the war ended, European and American automobile operators competed to open up markets in China. The number of automobiles in Shanghai suddenly increased. The rental car business gradually expanded, and buses were also in operation. Transportation in Shanghai became the domain of automobiles. Although during the occupation period, due to the interruption of gasoline supply, the number of automobiles in the city decreased. After the victory, many long-abandoned automobiles reappeared, coupled with military jeeps and large trucks, filling the roads. No one remembers the era of clattering carriages and neighing horses thirty years ago.

### A Casual Discussion on Rickshaws: As Early As 1874, French Introduced Eastern Product

The rickshaw is a very common means of transportation today. From a scientific point of view, it is not only too backward, but also inhumane, but with public transportation so crowded today, rickshaws still have the possibility of existing.

The rickshaw is a product of Japan. It first arrived in Shanghai as early as 1874. A Frenchman named Mira imported this thing from Japan. With the approval of the French Concession Council, the first notice was issued on March 24. Mira then obtained permission from the French Concession Council and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to prepare 300 vehicles for business in the concession. This was the first scene of rickshaws in Shanghai. However, Mira did not get rich from running the rickshaw business for two years, but instead lost money. As a result, he fled to Vladivostok.

Because rickshaws came from Japan, they were initially called Eastern Cars. Later, the car bodies were all painted yellow, so they were also called Yellow Packet Cars. At first, the wheels were tall, similar to the rear wheels of horse-drawn carriages. The wheels were made of wood, surrounded by iron rings, making a rattling sound when moving, which was very loud. The car body was larger than what is seen now, and could seat two people, slightly like today's tricycles. Later, because there were cases of men and women engaging in improper behavior, the police strictly prohibited it for reasons related to morality, and reduced the size of the car body to only accommodate one person.

### Steel Wire Rubber Wheels Were Once Prohibited

The use of steel wire rubber wheels in rickshaws was a major improvement. At that time, a company called Nitto Trading near Mud City Bridge invented steel wire to replace wooden wheels, and rubber tires were used instead of iron rings. The ride was less bumpy, which was considered very modern at the time. However, because the wheels were silent when walking, the rickshaw pullers often did not warn people first, which often led to collisions with pedestrians. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council once prohibited it. The steel wire rubber wheels only became popular in 1914.

In the past when concessions existed, rickshaws were divided into large licenses and small licenses. A large license referred to a license from the Public Concession and also a license from the French Concession. If a Chinese license was also donated, it would be able to pass without obstruction, which was the most convenient. A small license only had a French Concession license and no Public Concession license, and could not be driven in the Public Concession. Because the scope of activity was small, the price was also cheaper. If there was only a Chinese license and no concession license, it was a third-rate car. This was the consistent style of the concession era, not just for rickshaws.

### Regardless of Wind, Frost, and Dew, Running East and West All Day Long

Rickshaw pullers rely on their strength to do this work like cattle and horses, and their lives are the hardest. All day and night, in wind, frost, and dew, running east and west, selling sweat and blood to maintain their minimum living, they also suffered from layers of exploitation. The misery and pain were beyond description. In July 1934, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Council, a rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association was established to handle the welfare of rickshaw pullers, which achieved some success.

When tram workers go on strike or when the roads are flooded, rickshaw pullers become the favored ones. They demand 2,000 to 3,000 yuan for a short distance. When the bustling city becomes a watery country and it is impossible to wade through, people have to rely on them, even if it is a little expensive, they have to endure it.

"Wild Chicken" chartered rickshaws were the first step in the development of rickshaws. The pullers of "Wild Chicken" chartered rickshaws were mostly rickshaw pullers who accumulated money from pulling soldiers, bought a half-new or old rickshaw, donated a license for a privately-used rickshaw, and could make their "Wild Chicken" business at the crossroads. These cars are newer, and passengers can pretend that they are their own, so the fare is more expensive. The pullers of "Wild Chicken" chartered rickshaws sometimes had the possibility of becoming the owners of rental rickshaws.

### Rickshaws Eliminated Under the Wheels of Time

Rickshaws are considered inhumane and unscientific. The city has a plan to gradually eliminate rickshaws, and the Executive Yuan also has a motion to abolish rickshaws at the National Transportation Conference. However, as early as ten years ago, the Shanghai Municipal Council had implemented its preliminary measures, such as restricting rickshaw registration, reducing the issuance of rickshaw licenses, and organizing rickshaw puller registration. Later, during the war, the population in the concession suddenly increased, while public transportation was restricted, so not only did the number of rickshaws not decrease, but it increased significantly. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, it seems that the rickshaw that has been in use for more than 70 years will eventually be "sentenced to death," but how will the lives of these 50,000 to 60,000 rickshaw pullers be solved? There are also 300,000 people who indirectly rely on rickshaws for a living, which is even more difficult.

### Founding Record of Public Transportation

Trams and buses, which once traveled in the city, are the only means of transportation for Shanghai citizens. Although passengers are so crowded and it takes a lot of time to wait for vehicles, the fares are low, and most citizens are unwilling to give up their rights. The history of trams and buses is not very long. Trams have been running for less than 40 years, and buses have only been around for 20 years.

Since Shanghai opened up, foreigners continued to arrive in Shanghai. By 1895, there were 4,684 foreigners in the concession north of the Yangjingbang, and 432 foreigners in the French Concession. For their own convenience, they felt it necessary to establish public transportation.

### Tram

In July 1881, Jardine Matheson requested the French Concession Council to establish trams. On August 1, a meeting of taxpayers in the concession was convened to hear opinions on trams. As a result, out of 93 people, 53 people agreed, thus determining the principle of preparing to establish trams in the concession.

In 1895, an American named Hent proposed to build trams in the Public Concession of Yangjingbang, and asked the Shanghai Municipal Council to submit it to the Taxpayers' Association for review. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai Water Company and the Shanghai Gas Company believed that the tram tracks used electric current, and if the layout was improper, it would corrode or damage the pipes buried under the road, so they sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, expressing their disagreement. Shortly after, Hent returned to the United States. Another person named Waste applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council, saying that if the Taxpayers' Association accepted Hent's proposal, he would be willing to invest 150,000 taels to build 2 kilometers of tracks and operate trams. However, Hent's original proposal had been rejected, so his proposal was silenced.

In 1897, a Belgian track construction company proposed to build trams in the concession. Later, a French company, Lyon Far East Industrial Construction Company, also submitted a construction request. At that time, the French Concession Council originally intended to jointly operate the tram business with the Public Concession, so the case was shelved.

### British Attempt to Patent, French Merchants Go Their Separate Ways

On March 24, 1898, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the Conseil d'Administration of the French Concession jointly formed a Tram Design Committee.  The International Settlement dispatched two directors, and the French Concession dispatched one director, who, together with the engineers from both administrations, composed the committee. At the time, the Shanghai Municipal Council advocated using a standard gauge of 1.44 meters, while the French Concession argued that the standard would be too expensive and that wages would be difficult to make affordable for the public. It would be better to use a width of one meter. As a result, the two sides went their separate ways. On October 4, 1899, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Conseil d'Administration of the French Concession held another joint meeting to review the plans received from factories in various countries. Six factories submitted bids: (1) French firm Lixing Foreign Firm, (2) German firm United Electrical Company, (3) Belgian firm Track Construction Company, (4) French firm Lyon Industrial Construction Company, (5) American firm Shanghai Tram Company, and (6) British firm British Electrical Transportation Company. After review, the plan from the American firm Shanghai Tram Company was considered the best, and the conditions were the most suitable. The plan was then published in the North-China Daily News on October 7, and an electors' meeting was convened on October 17 in both concessions to solicit consent, but the meeting rejected the plan.

It is said that the reason for the rejection was that at that time, the majority of voters were British, and everyone hoped to reserve the patent for this business to the British. Therefore, the French Consul General told the Conseil d'Administration that since the International Settlement's electors' meeting had decided to reserve the tram business for the British, we should also study a plan for the French merchants to handle it as a countermeasure. As a result, French manufacturers engaged in extensive activities. Finally, in November 1905, the Belgian International Far East Company and the French Concession Electric Weekly established a preliminary agreement, and the contract was formally signed on January 24 of the following year. Thus, the French Concession Electric Military Company was born.

### Tram Birth in 1908

Although the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan for trams was rejected, it continued to actively pursue it. In 1902, it re-tendered, and as a result, the plan of the White-Lu Electrical Engineering Company was approved. A contract was signed on May 14, 1903, stipulating that traffic should be opened within three years. However, due to the lack of wide-gauge tracks and the insufficient load capacity of narrow-gauge tracks, the plan was shelved. In 1905, with the consent of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the franchise was given to the Shanghai Tram Company.

After the authorities of the two concessions made their decisions, they proceeded to lay tracks and erect poles separately. The planned routes at that time for the International Settlement were three: (1) from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park, (2) from Jing'an Temple to the Bund, and (3) from Yangshupu to the Bund. The French Concession stipulated two routes: (1) from Xiaodongmen to Xujiahui, and (2) from Baochang Road to Xujiahui. In February 1908, the French Concession trams began operating, and a month later, the International Settlement trams also began operating. The tram, which many people had longed for, was finally realized.

### Passengers Safe and Sound, Business Thriving

When the tram first started operating, the citizens found it very strange, so the Bund area was full of people watching the excitement every day. On both sides of the roads in the Yangjingbang area, people gesticulated and talked about the tram in the streets and alleys. In addition to Westerners, very few Chinese people rode the tram. This was because at that time, electricity was considered very dangerous, and people believed that if they had gold and silver in their pockets, they would be electrocuted. The public was confused by this absurd rumor and dared not try it out. Therefore, the words "Safe, Fast, and Cheap, the Public Can Ride" were written on the tram to attract customers. After a month, people found that passengers were safe and sound, and the business gradually began to thrive.

### In the Second Year of the Republic, Nantao Opens to Traffic, Trackless Trams Follow

The Nantao trams, together with the International Settlement and French Concession trams, formed a tripod. However, its establishment was later than the concessions. After the concession trams were realized, foreigners had already paid attention to this and repeatedly requested the authorities, but they were not accepted. In the first year of the Republic (1912), Lu Jianhong, the manager of the Inland Electric Light Company, submitted a request to the municipal authorities to trial-run trams because the company had several storage engines that were very suitable for operating trams. After approval, he raised 200,000 yuan and ordered materials from abroad to begin construction. In the second year of the Republic (1913), the materials arrived in Shanghai, and the tracks were laid. After three months of work, a trial run was conducted in July, and official operation began on August 1. From then on, Nantao also had trams.

In 1914, the International Settlement began operating trackless trams, with two routes: (1) from North Henan Road and Laobazi Road to Minguo Road, and (2) from Zha Pu Road and Haining Road to Avenue Edward VII. The French Concession trackless trams began operating in 1926, with three routes: (1) from Jixiang Street to Jiangxi Road, (2) from Zhengjia Wooden Bridge to Fujian Road, and (3) from Mintiniyin Road to Xujiahui, making transportation more convenient. There was once a rumor that trackless trams would replace trams, but this never happened. However, the newly added routes in recent years have all been trackless.

### Public Buses Emerge in Response to the Times

The operation of public buses began in 1924, but as early as when trams were being established, some people advocated operating public buses, believing that buses did not need to lay tracks and set up lines, making the project simpler and the cost lower. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Council had already decided to start a tram project, and the proposal for public buses was shelved.

In 1920, British citizen Tong Hansheng organized the China Motor Company, planning to operate public buses within the International Settlement. The route would run from the Bund, along Avenue Edward VII, through Xizang Road, Haining Road, to Wusong Road. A special contract was signed with the Shanghai Municipal Council, allowing the company to operate, but due to financial reasons, it was not realized. In 1921, Tong Hansheng brought up the old matter again, planning a route from Jing'an Temple, along Yu Garden Road, to Zhaofeng Garden. After negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council, two 30-person buses were started. However, because the expenses were much higher than expected, and the income and expenses could not be offset, the operation was soon suspended.

### Giant Buses Appear in 1924

At this time, Arnold and Frantrick were also drafting a public bus plan. After the China Motor Company closed, Frantrick, in his capacity as a representative, requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to operate public buses within the International Settlement. In January 1923, he obtained a patent. In August, he raised one million taels of capital and formally established the China Public Bus Company. He began to build factories, order vehicles, and actively prepare. After discussions with the Shanghai Municipal Council, ten routes were decided. The first route ran from the Bund, along Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, Hart Road, to Jing'an Temple, and began operating in October 1924 with six buses. The first giant public bus in Shanghai appeared. Its appearance was far more modern than the outdated trams. Everyone sat on leather cushions, secretly rejoicing that the common people also had buses that the public could ride. It is said that the structure of the yellow public buses was based on the suggestion of the technical expert Selick, using the Stephenson standard chassis to reduce the friction between the tires and the road surface, making the ride smooth, the management easy, and the passengers safe and comfortable. It was indeed the result of a thorough study. In 1929, the Shanghai Municipal Council revised the temporary contract of the China Public Bus Company and concluded a formal special business agreement. The company paid the Shanghai Municipal Council a road usage fee and completely monopolized the public bus business of the International Settlement.

After obtaining the patent for the International Settlement, the Public Bus Company worked hard to expand its business and expand its routes, successively opening fifteen routes, with a total length of more than seventy miles. At its peak, it had a total of 174 various types of buses, built sheds, established assembly and repair factories, and employed 420 drivers, 587 ticket sellers, 92 ticket inspectors, 133 mechanics, and 150 miscellaneous workers. In addition, there were also temporary workers. It was a huge organization. The daily number of passengers reached a peak of 250,000 in 1938.

Everyone "struggled" to get on the tram, resulting in a chaotic order. The ticket sellers inevitably uttered many unpleasant complaints, and many disputes often occurred. In fact, if everyone kept order and lined up to get on the bus, what a good thing that would be!

### Express Buses Added in 1929

When public buses first started operating, there was only one type of giant vehicle, with fixed schedules. In 1929, express buses were added, operating during office hours. Except for the starting and ending points, they did not stop along the way. In 1934, due to crowded passengers, double-decker buses were introduced, creating a new record in the history of Shanghai transportation. In 1937, streamlined buses were added, which were even more novel. After the January 28th Incident, the supply of gasoline was cut off, and the public buses stopped operating. After four years of enemy and puppet destruction, the whereabouts of these vehicles are unknown. Most of them were taken away by the Japanese, leaving only some damaged vehicles that could not be repaired. Now the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has set a deadline of November for them to resume operations, otherwise it will revoke their patent rights. What plans do the managers of the Public Bus Company have?

The public buses of the French Concession were an affiliated business of the tram company. In 1925, the tram company and the Conseil d'Administration of the French Concession signed a contract to operate trackless trams and public buses, stipulating that two public bus routes should be opened within six months after the trackless trams began operating. In February 1927, the French Concession also had public buses.

### Chinese Merchants' Buses Repeatedly Suffer War

The public buses in the Chinese area were operated by the Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company. The Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company signed a contract with the municipal government in April of the seventeenth year (1928) and obtained a patent. In November, it first opened to traffic in Zhabei. During the January 28th Incident, the losses were extremely heavy. After the municipal government moved to the city center, it expanded its routes again, so it was unable to take care of both the Nantao and Pudong areas and voluntarily gave them up. The original Hunan Public Bus Company in Nantao operated buses, but due to poor management, it declared bankruptcy in the twentieth year (1931). It was then operated by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities. When the War of Resistance broke out and Shanghai fell, it also stopped operating.

### Causes and Consequences of the Yarn Allocation Organization, Past Shortcomings, Internal Difficulties, Preconditions for Implementing Control

Yarn Allocation Mechanism

[Report from This Newspaper] Since Mayor Wu expressed his intention to strengthen control over the joint yarn allocation by yarn factories last Friday, all parties have been anticipating how the future will develop. It has been learned that since private yarn factories began joint allocation on August 30, the results have been less than satisfactory for a month and a half, and have been criticized by all parties. In particular, the inquiry by Legislator Sun Jiulu and others of the Legislative Yuan on the 4th of this month left the economic authorities unable to justify themselves. Therefore, Mayor Wu's concurrent appointment as the director of the management committee to strengthen control is a new measure. According to sources familiar with the matter, this move has been brewing for a long time and is not a sudden measure. It is said that the government's original intention was to place the production of all yarn factories under the control of the Textile Construction, and the joint organization would naturally have considerable power.

Initial Accommodation

Later, in order not to be too hasty, and because the yarn factory industry expressed its willingness to assist the government's price stabilization policy with the spirit of self-governance, considerable accommodation was made during implementation. According to the method, purchasers must negotiate prices with the various yarn factory textile industry associations under the supervision of the Textile Management Committee and publicly announce the allocation quantity. According to this method, in addition to participating in price negotiations, the Textile Management Committee did not delve into the actual distribution situation. Therefore, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday when yarn was opened, the Textile Construction and the yarn factory industry still went their separate ways. It is not without reason that powerful figures in the replica industry pointed out that the joint allocation had not been implemented.

Joint Allocation Fails

However, in the initial few periods, the listing price could barely be maintained. Later, as the black market rose daily, the actual allocation situation of yarn factories became increasingly blurred. Cotton product replica industries, which were initially dissatisfied with Textile Construction, felt that although Textile Construction had less goods, the degree of openness was far better than that of private yarn factories. Moreover, users of yarn who had dealings with yarn factories in the past found it more difficult to purchase than before the joint allocation. Yarn firms repeatedly expressed their disappointment, unable to benefit, while the circulation of black market yarn became increasingly prevalent. People both inside and outside the industry became suspicious, and yarn factories became the target of public criticism. According to disclosures from the yarn factory industry, they also seem to have their difficulties.

Yarn Factory Difficulties

For example, 26 yarn factories in this city have joined the joint allocation, while small factories and large factories outside the urban area have not participated. Since equal allocation has a sacrificial nature, why favor them over us? This is one. Since the beginning of the exchange rate change on August 19, the authorities have clearly stated that the flowers used by the factories have been provided by the government and settled at the old exchange rate, so the source of raw materials has not increased in price, and the price of yarn should not increase either. However, a small number of large factories have not yet settled their drafts and are requesting settlement at the old exchange rate, but they have never been approved. This is two. When the black market exceeds 2 million (20 counts), the allocated price is limited to 1.55 million. Textile Construction sells one-third of the yarn, and commercial factories sell two-thirds of the yarn. Yarn factories believe that the sacrifice is too heavy. This is three. Yarn factories have made many allocations, and there must be some sacrifice, but the black market is soaring, and the people are not benefiting. Those who take advantage of the opportunity to resell and make a fortune. This is four. For these reasons, suspicions and anger are mixed, and the government has not made any improvements. Therefore, some colleagues have made angry remarks, saying that since yarn factories cannot make money, they can stop working and return their capital. If the government can sacrifice, then they can let the government advance funds to start work. The situation has become increasingly profound, and there has been a change in the management organization in the near future.

Consequences are Worrying

According to insiders, the yarn produced by private yarn factories will be completely placed under the management of Textile Construction, and will be handled in the same way as the yarn sold by Textile Construction. The price limit may be slightly increased, and the black market will not be openly unscrupulous. The government will also strengthen control over yarn users. The final stage may be to control the cloth shops. However, as control in this city becomes stronger, the production of yarn and cloth may decrease, and the market outside the control line will become more lively, and its market price will also rise. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall society, whether it is beneficial or harmful is worth studying. It is said that an authority in the cotton product replica industry once told a gentleman from the Textile Management Committee to seriously consider it and not be too hasty, lest it be counterproductive and cause a panic of materials. The gentleman was also very moved, but said that the yarn factories are unwilling to sincerely cooperate with the government, and the government also has no choice. Therefore, although control must be strengthened, the consequences are worth noting.

Final Decision

The director of the Textile Business Management Committee was originally Mr. Shu Yunzhang. This gentleman is a veteran of the textile industry. President Song relied heavily on him, and he himself came from the business world and knew more about the actual hardships. This time, he resigned, reportedly at his strong request, in order to relieve himself of responsibility. Now the director is held concurrently by Mayor Wu, while Mr. Shu remains a member. In addition to General Manager Shu, Textile Construction also has two deputy managers, one is Mr. Wu Weijing and the other is Mr. Li Shengbo. Wu was originally a member, and Li has also been appointed as a member this time. Observers believe that the center of gravity of the organization is still in Textile Construction. Mr. Shu is probably still the only powerful figure with decision-making power. Mayor Wu will use his political power to strengthen the implementation of this decision.

Scholarly Opinions

Economists generally express dissatisfaction with the rise in yarn and cloth prices, and also believe that it is difficult to enforce the strengthening of control. A well-informed person said that economic matters still need to be handled with economic policies. Control must have a comprehensive plan and complete statistical materials before it can be effective. Now that implementation is limited to this city, it may promote the escape of materials. Statistics are biased to one area and cannot be used for comprehensive regulation. In the end, it is not as good as hard-line supplements of rice and grain, and the black market is still difficult to succumb. The yarn and cloth industry has suffered enough blows during the enemy and puppet period and is weak. Yarn factories are encountering opportunities and have considerable surpluses. They should be guided well and not allowed to escape capital and production to decline.

### Artificial Silk Rises by 500,000 in the Past Week, Silk Also Increases Steadily

Artificial silk rose sharply again last week. 120 Bridge of Heaven Light, one was 3.7 million yuan, up 50,000 yuan on Tuesday. On Wednesday, it suddenly became excited, opening 350,000 yuan higher. It continued to rise by 250,000 yuan on Thursday. It did not fall until the end of the week when the Textile Construction Company increased its allocation, falling by 150,000 yuan. The result was a rise of 500,000 yuan in one week. Miscellaneous brands of light and semi-light, etc., also followed suit. In short, if the allocation cannot meet the actual sales volume, there is no hope of suppressing the price of artificial silk, because the holders of goods see through this mystery and gradually increase the price, forcing manufacturers to bow their heads.

Factory warp is stable, CDE grades, always hovering up and down, with only 50,000 yuan difference. The warp of the new bank is always between 2.7 million and 750,000. Open goods are around 500,000 to 550,000 yuan. People still hope to be optimistic, but there are few transactions, so there is no power to rise. The price of silk goods has increased steadily. The Meiya quilt surface was 2.7 million yuan on Monday, and the smallest was 650,000 yuan on Tuesday. The largest shouted 2.75 million yuan on the weekend. The China Jin embroidery increased by 100 yuan in total last week. The various goods in Shenghang are generally stable, without much change.

### Antimony Imports Still Subject to Control, US Government Recently Announced

### Senators Request Low-Interest Loans to Rescue Small Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, City Bank Allocates Funds, Finance Committee to Discuss Specific Measures Today

The current interest rate in this city ranges from 1.2 to 2 cents per month, all settled in 3, 5, 7, or 10 days. On average, in 3 to 5 months, the principal and interest can double. Merchants' prices also increase in the same proportion in order to maintain the principal and interest. Therefore, more than 80% of the people's meager income obtained from hard work all day long is enjoyed by a small number of banks, money shops, and property owners, and the society becomes more stable. Recently, the various low-interest loans requested from the government by various sectors have inevitably been used for lending. Not only have the citizens not received any real benefits, but they have also been harmed. The grain loan is one example. At the same time, the so-called industrial and commercial loans are only available to the upper-level figures with power and means. The government borrows more money, and they make more money. If the livelihood of the lower-level people cannot be improved, the country will not be able to achieve prosperity and happiness, and the society cannot ensure law and order. Senator Xing Xiang and others, in view of this, specially proposed that the Shanghai Bank should provide low-interest loans to suppress prices and ensure the safety of the lives of the majority of the people. The method is for the municipal government to order the Shanghai Bank to allocate funds to lend to small industrial and commercial stores and daily vegetable sellers who are indeed engaged in daily necessities at the lowest monthly interest rate. The government can also restrict the selling prices of the factories, stores, and sellers that receive loans. The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council attaches great importance to this case and has decided to hold a subcommittee meeting at 3:00 PM today on the third floor of the Bank of Communications to discuss specific measures.

### Nanchang Prices Soar, Provincial Government Forms Price Review Committee

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanchang, 13th] The Nanchang market fluctuated greatly this week, especially with the astonishing rise in the price of yarn and cloth.

The gold market was affected by the Shanghai market and climbed by 10,000 this weekend, selling for 250,000. Decorated gold is charged an additional 10,000 for labor, but transactions are weak. Grain prices have also fluctuated slightly. Three-engine Wan rice is 32,000, early rice is 28,000, and snow-white rice is 124,000. Rock sugar is 300,000. The provincial government will form a price review committee due to the high prices affecting the people's livelihood.

### Italian Currency Inflation, Prices Rise 4,600 Times

[Reuters, Rome, 12th] Italy is currently experiencing a period of extremely dangerous currency inflation. If the government does not take appropriate measures immediately, Italy's fragile economic alert may collapse. The main reason for the current loss of credit in the lira is the Paris Peace Conference's decision that Italy should compensate the Soviet Union with 100 million US dollars. At the same time, at least a portion of the compensation demands of other countries must also be fulfilled.

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] The amount of banknotes issued in Italy is almost sixteen times the amount before the war. The official market price index is 2,300 times higher than before, and the black market price index is 4,600 times higher than before.

### American Goods and Chemicals Invade, Domestic Chemical Industry on the Verge of Collapse

There are currently more than a dozen chemical factories in this city. They prospered briefly in the five months after victory. Most of these factories supplied the city's factories with bleaching powder, potassium chlorate, caustic soda, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, etc. However, since American bleaching powder, potassium chlorate, etc., entered the market, because their prices were lower than the cost of domestic goods, they almost monopolized the trade of chemical raw materials in this city. At this point, the various chemical factories were on the verge of collapse and stopped operating automatically. The Tianyuan Chemical Factory can produce 4-500 boxes of bleaching powder and about 30 boxes of potassium chlorate per month. Now the work in these two major production departments has completely stopped, and only the production of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate (rubber raw materials) is maintained.

### A Review of the New Goods Tax

— Xu Riqing

The government began collecting the new goods tax on the 1st of this month, including seven categories: wheat flour, cement, tea, fur, tin foil and superstitious paper, beverages, and cosmetics. The tax rate on cotton yarn was increased from 3.5% to 5%. There were no changes to the old rates for cigarettes, smoked tobacco, firewood, and sugar. The rate for foreign wine and beer increased from 60% to 100%. Recently, manufacturers have been crying out in pain. The woolen textile industry has politely refused the temporary dispatch of personnel to the bureau to collect the goods tax, and tea merchants in Yongjia have even stopped transporting tea to Shanghai. However, according to the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, the goods tax is an indirect tax that is passed on to consumers and does not affect manufacturers. What exactly is the goods tax? This is worth exploring.

The goods tax is indeed an indirect tax, so the taxation target is not directly on income earners but on consumers. Therefore, it cannot meet the principle of ability to pay, nor can it meet the principle of sufficient finance. In general theory, it has four shortcomings:

(1) Indirect income, tax payment time, and expenses are all inaccurate.

(2) Although the investigation fee when establishing an indirect tax is small, the subsequent inspection fees, collection fees, etc. are very large.

(3) Indirect taxes can indeed be passed on, but their ultimate destination is mostly the proletariat or the middle class, which violates the principle of fairness.

(4) The collection of indirect taxes hinders industrial development and transportation development, which is not in line with the principles of national economy.

Therefore, the modern tax development process has gradually changed from 1 proportional tax to progressive tax, 2 classified tax to comprehensive tax, and 3 tax on objects to tax on people, all in order to achieve the four principles of equality, accuracy, convenience, and economy. The goods tax is actually out of step with the times. Our government wants to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure and increase tax revenue, but it is still expanding the scope of the goods tax. This measure can only be said to be a last resort.

But can this tax revenue really make up for the deficit finance? Taking tea as an example, when the import surplus is very large and exports are sluggish, it is naturally limited to domestic sales. But how much can this tax revenue be? Taking the woolen textile industry as an example, when "cheap and beautiful" American goods compete with foreign goods, if you add the cost of the goods tax, sales will be even more problematic. The result may only be reduced work and closures. Wheat flour, matches, and sugar are essential commodities for the people, and theoretically should not be taxed. Only cosmetics can be considered a luxury, and it is okay to levy a heavy tax. However, under the dumping of American cosmetics, they have long been unable to gain a foothold, and the production volume is still very limited. How much revenue is there? As for fur, tin foil, and superstitious paper, they are not major commodities and do not provide much help to finance. It is said that the income from the goods tax in Shanghai in August was about 26 billion. I am afraid that after the new goods tax is levied, it may not be able to increase as expected, and the following four disadvantages can be predicted.

(1) Suppressing National Industry: National goods that are already unable to compete with foreign goods, will the cost of sales not increase if the goods tax is levied again? Will its competitiveness not be weaker?

(2) Increasing the Burden on the Common People: Goods tax is mostly consumer goods, which are daily necessities for the people. After the tax is levied, manufacturers will inevitably increase prices, and as a result, only the common people will increase the burden, which is contrary to the government's price stabilization policy.

(3) Making Foreign Goods Sell Even Better: The flooding of American goods has already caused concerns among the community. Now that the cost of domestic goods has increased, will foreign goods not be easier to sell? Although the Jianghai Customs has collected the goods tax on imported foreign goods, the cost of foreign goods is taxed according to the value of the invoice, while domestic goods are taxed according to the market price. How can domestic goods compete?

(4) Tax Evasion of Smuggled Goods Will Inevitably Increase: Currently, tax evasion of smuggled goods has become an open secret, and the government does not seem to have effective measures. Under the high tax rate, it will undoubtedly increase the gambling mentality of ordinary merchants.

Now, the general manufacturers can no longer hold on and are crying out loudly. At this time, the government should carefully consider whether this policy of abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial is worth pursuing.

### Border Culture and Education Center to Establish a Border Language Printing Press Central Border News to Resume Publication in Beijing

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 13th Electric] In order to promote national culture and encourage border people to look inward, the Ministry of Education issued a Central Border News in Mongolian and Tibetan in October last year. Later, due to the return to the capital, it was suspended for several months. It has now resumed publication in Beijing and changed to a magazine format, 16 open, and is still issued once a month.

### The Ministry of Education Decides to Improve the Academic Level of University Students Focusing on the First Year First

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 13th Electric] The Ministry of Education believes that the academic level of university students has declined in recent years and should be improved. For example, the passing standard for newly admitted university students last year was 40 points (the situation varies from school to school, and not all schools use 40 points as the passing mark). The Ministry of Education stipulates that the standard must be increased by 10 points to 50 points this year. The fundamental method is to revise the university curriculum standards and the enrollment system.

System Aspects

In the past, the Ministry of Education had established a small number of preparatory classes to accommodate high school graduates who had not been admitted to universities. After passing the preparatory examination, they were guaranteed to be promoted to universities, with a limit of 50% of the quota. This year, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice to all universities and independent colleges to establish preparatory classes. The nature is different from the past. After studying in the class for one year and passing the examination, they will be directly promoted to the university. At the same time, the curriculum standards of various universities will be revised, the content will be sorted out for various major courses, the complicated will be eliminated, and the suitability will be sought, so as to reduce the malpractice of reviewing the teaching materials that have been read in high school in the early stage of the first year of university. The current preparatory class has studied a considerable curriculum for one year and does not need to repeat it, wasting study time.

Curriculum Aspects

The Ministry of Education has long started to revise the entire curriculum of university colleges and is still continuing to do so. However, this matter is of great importance and must be discussed by many experts repeatedly, signed and commented on, and refined before it can be used as a final decision. The date of publication of the standard may be postponed to next year. It is said that the improvement of the education level of university students first focuses on the first year. Following the process already studied in the preparatory class, the curriculum content is eliminated from the complicated, evolved, so as to avoid wasting time. Therefore, in addition to issuing a notice to all universities to improve the English level, the Ministry of Education will also improve the level of other major subjects.

Great Progress in the Battle

The Conquered Wheels made great progress in the battle last night. The passing and throwing of the three forwards also had wonderful performances from time to time. The defense was very successful. The use of man-to-man defense made the Shantou team helpless. It is a pity that the Conquered Wheels seem to be not yet proficient in the rules of the game, such as the ten-second rule in the backcourt, etc. If the team can be trained for a period of time, young and strong, there is great hope. The Shantou team was very abnormal, the whole team was disorganized, and the shooting was inaccurate. It seemed like a B-group basketball team, resulting in a defeat.

Before long, Lin Weiting of the Shantou team won two free throws, but both missed. Yu Ruizhang of the Conquered Wheels made one free throw and one shot, adding three points. The Shantou team lost its color. Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqiang of the Conquered Wheels were active and abnormal. At the end of the first half, the Conquered Wheels took the lead by 27 to 16.

The Shantou Team Closely Followed but Failed

After the break, Tu Wenlong broke the basket from a distance, and Lin Weiting returned the color. At 33 to 20, Liu Jingxing replaced Lin Weiting, and Cai Yanxiong was pushed into the crowd. The Conquered Wheels called a timeout. At this time, the Shantou team gradually became active, forcing it to 29 to 36. Tu Wenlong was sent off for five fouls, and Liu Zhenjun replaced him. At this time, Lin Jicong entered the field and transferred Cai Yanxiong. The lineup of the Conquered Wheels was inevitably affected by this change. When it was 31 to 36, Cai Zhongqiang fouled again and graduated, and Wang Binghuan replaced him. Chen Qingjiang shot from a distance and hit. Wang Binghuan added three points with a series of throws and penalties. At the end of the statutory time, the Conquered Wheels defeated the Shantou team by 39 to 32.

The semi-finals of the Mayor's Cup small football tournament were held at Jinyuan Park at 2:30 pm yesterday. More than 1,000 spectators watched. As a result, Jianxing won the Lun team by one to zero, and Longjie also won the Yunlun team by one to zero. Jianxing Transport also won the finals. The finals will be held this Saturday to determine the champion. Mayor Wu is invited to the field to present the awards at that time.

Jianwu has many Donghua warriors, Chen Mingzhe and Tao Tingfu, who are brave and good at fighting, while the Lun team is also very strong. The two sides fought very wonderfully. In the first half, both sides did not gain anything. After changing positions, Jianxing launched a terrible offensive. At 5 minutes, Chen Mingzhe broke the record. The Lun team counterattacked, but it was difficult to succeed. As a result, Jianxing eliminated the Lun team by one to zero.

In another scene, Longjie vs Transport was a wall dispute. Before the game, Yunlun voluntarily gave up, and Longjie won the finals without labor by one to zero. Immediately, the two sides changed to a friendly match, and Longjie defeated Yunlun by two to one in a difficult battle.

### The North China Basketball Leader Huasheng Team Flies to Shanghai Today The Final Battle Against Qunsheng May Become a Reality

It is widely rumored that the Huasheng Basketball Team, a strong team from the North, will come to Shanghai. The team sent a telegram to the Shanghai Basketball Committee a few days ago, stating that it is scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Ping today, and the plane tickets have also been booked, so there should be no mistake. After receiving the telegram, the Basketball Committee has started to prepare all the reception matters. The original text of the team's telegram is recorded as follows:

"Huasheng Team, because the plane tickets have been booked, Li Qingan will lead the team to fly to Shanghai from Ping on the 14th. Postponement is impossible. I hope the reception will be properly arranged. Tianjin Branch of the Sports Association Huasheng Team Kowtows (12th)."

According to the reporter's inquiry to the China Aviation Corporation, the China Aviation aircraft flying from Beiping is likely to arrive at Longhua General Stadium around 6:00 pm today. Qian Zucang, chairman of the Basketball Committee, was originally in Wuxi yesterday. After receiving the news that Huasheng was coming to Shanghai, he took the 6:30 express train back and will personally go to the airport to welcome the team today.

Civil Affairs Briefing

### Municipal Government Circular to All Districts: Investigate Neglected Public Properties for Transfer to Commercial Use and Promotion of Productive Enterprises

The Municipal Government approved a resolution from the Municipal Council's first session, which stated that many public buildings in the city had been damaged during the war, leaving behind ruins or wasteland. It was regrettable that these properties remained neglected without reconstruction. Meanwhile, districts seeking to develop projects such as productive enterprises, parks, and public sports fields faced difficulties in finding land. If these neglected public properties could be utilized, with the Municipal Government consulting the relevant authorities for temporary transfer or custodianship, they could serve local public welfare purposes. While temporary, this would still provide some benefit, preserving public assets, preventing neglect, and benefiting the local community significantly. The resolution requested the Municipal Government to issue a circular to all districts to investigate and report on public properties suitable for temporary use, and to transfer them to the relevant authorities for provisional use. The Municipal Government, recognizing the urgent need to develop productive enterprises in each district, issued a "Neglected Public Property Investigation Form" and instructed all districts to investigate and report any suitable neglected public properties for temporary use, so they could be transferred for commercial use.

Ninth District Constable Changes

Zhang Deguo, the constable of the 21st neighborhood in the 9th district (Changning), requested to resign due to relocation and inability to oversee his duties. The district temporarily appointed Qin Xiukuan to replace him, and has submitted this appointment to the Municipal Government for approval.

### Household Registration Fines Increased According to Wartime Regulations

Regarding household registration fines, the Municipal Government previously telegraphed the Ministry of Interior for approval. The Ministry of Interior has now replied, stating that household registration fines can be increased up to fifty times the original amount, according to Article 3 of the Wartime Fine Increase Regulations. The increase in document review fees and transcription fees has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review.

Two New Neighborhoods Planned for the First District

Li Bingxian, the head of the 5th sub-neighborhood of the 8th neighborhood in the 1st district (Huangpu), and Jing Fatang, the head of the 7th sub-neighborhood, resigned. Qiu Renhan and Shi Jiatuan were appointed to replace them, respectively. The neighborhood also plans to add an 11th sub-neighborhood, with Wang Hongyi as its head. Zhu Jinzhan, the head of the 2nd sub-neighborhood of the 17th neighborhood, resigned and was replaced by Ni Chenghao. Additionally, the 20th neighborhood plans to add a 40th sub-neighborhood and has temporarily appointed Liu Huoqing as its head. These appointments have been submitted by the district office to the Municipal Government for approval.

### District News in Brief

The 6th District Office held a meeting for constables at the Xujiawan Police Station conference room on the afternoon of the 11th of this month to discuss winter defense measures.

Zhu Shuiting, the deputy constable of the 32nd neighborhood in the 18th district (Tilanqiao), resigned. Mao Jiaquan is proposed to fill the position, and the district has submitted this proposal to the Municipal Government for approval.

The 32nd district (Zhenru) plans to create a new sub-neighborhood from the 38th sub-neighborhood onwards in the 4th neighborhood due to a dramatic increase in the population of the 19th sub-neighborhood, which now has 79 households. Chen Chen was selected as the head of the new sub-neighborhood, and the district is awaiting approval from the Civil Affairs Bureau.

### Visiting the Air Force Academy: One Day in Jianqiao

Everyone cherishes a deep affection for the magnificent and beautiful 'Cradle of the Chinese Air Force.' Every corner of Jianqiao is lovely.

By Our Reporter Xie Baozhu

My friends have all gone to Hangzhou to play, which makes me a little envious. It's been five years since I last saw West Lake. In the crisp autumn air, the West Lake is filled with light boats, and the sunset reflects on the autumn waves, making it even more graceful and beautiful than before. The green leaves on both sides of Su Causeway should also be fuller now. However, time does not permit, so I can only dismiss the idea. Fortunately, the impression of West Lake is still so vivid and deep. Suddenly, the day before the Double Tenth Festival, someone asked if I wanted to go to Hangzhou. The Jianqiao Air Force Academy had invited some musicians from Shanghai to perform, and a special plane would provide transportation. As soon as I heard the word "Jianqiao," I immediately felt like I was in a huge airport. I imagined the Air Force soldiers fighting the enemy and the tense scenes from movies, and I felt that while West Lake could be visited anytime, the Air Force Academy should be visited now. So, on the morning of National Day, we arrived at this "Cradle of the Chinese Air Force." Before the plane landed, I saw its solemnity and greatness. Twenty-seven planes performed a large formation display, followed by forming a "中" character. On the ground, I saw the podium decorated with flowers, the national flag fluttering around, and rows of Air Force soldiers drilling to the sound of military music. It turned out that the parade had just ended.

Jianqiao Air Force Academy airfield is packed with planes, as dense as dragonflies.

Three Air Force Generals: (Right) General Liu Muqun, (Center) Air Force Commander General Zhou Zhirou, (Left) Air Force Academy Education Director Hu Weike.

### First Impression of Education Director Hu

Lieutenant Li Chengyuan, a flying instructor at the Air Force Academy who piloted our plane, took us to the Education Director's office. Miss Feiman'er, a violinist, introduced us to Education Director Hu Weike, his wife, and his mother. My first impression of Education Director Hu was that he was a very astute and capable officer. He was tall and sturdy, with a strong military presence, yet also courteous. At first glance, it was clear that he had received a high level of education.

Education Director Hu is from Pingxiang, Jiangxi, and is 38 years old this year. He is a graduate of the first class of the military academy, fifteen years ago. Hu served as an aide to President Dai Jitao and traveled to Germany. In 1943, he went to India and served as the director of the junior class training program at the academy. In 1944, he went to England to study aviation education and returned to China at the end of last year. In August of this year, he came to Jianqiao to preside over school administration. Education Director Hu's every move represents his educational philosophy: "Absolutely strict when strictness is required, absolutely lively when liveliness is required." He himself feels that the students must think he is too strict, but in a military group, in a large team, when we see that everything is well-organized, orderly, disciplined, and systematic, we certainly cannot deny the merits of the leader.

At ten o'clock, the National Day memorial meeting began. We attended the meeting as guests and saw two hundred officers, students, and mechanics neatly arranged in the simply decorated, solemn, and spacious auditorium. Chairman Hu, the Education Director, gave a speech. These expressions of spirit made everyone feel excited. We were happy for the country's strength and for the future of the Air Force.

### The Academy Covers Thousands of Acres with Simple, Orderly, and Complete Internal Facilities

Instructor Li Chengyuan, the Education Director's adjutant, kindly invited us to visit various places. The size of the Air Force Academy's grounds was far beyond my imagination. According to Instructor Li, it covers thousands of acres, and the racecourse alone is as large as the Shanghai Racecourse.

The military academy currently has the 25th and 26th classes, as well as a small number of 24th class students, totaling 440 students and mechanics. The average age is eighteen to twenty-two years old. There are eighty instructors, as well as support soldiers. They live in rows of dormitories, the interiors of which are very simple and orderly. The cabinets next to each bed are always open for inspection by the officer of the day. Student lounges, recreation rooms, and various facilities are complete. Indoor sports include billiard tables and a special bowling alley. The swimming pool is well-equipped, with clear, turquoise water. Mercury lamps are installed around the pool so that it can be used at night. The auditorium is not very large, but the lighting and layout meet standards. A dressing room is attached to the back for theatrical performances. During the occupation, the enemy built fortresses and stationed cavalry at the academy, destroying all the buildings. The old auditorium was one of the casualties. When the academy was restored a year ago, it was rebuilt according to the old design. At the same time, many officers' residences were also built. When the military academy returned to Jianqiao, it ordered 2,000 Japanese prisoners of war to repair the airfield, school buildings, and plant trees as a practical lesson for the Japanese prisoners. In addition to the racecourse with sixteen small horses, which students take turns riding every morning from seven to eight o'clock, there is also a hunting area on the grounds. There are many wild rabbits and pheasants, and sometimes small foxes and wolves can be hunted. When the reporters visited the school, two American officers who were advisors to the school were about to ask the Education Director to send someone to accompany them hunting. They seemed very enthusiastic.

The school has only a few dozen planes, mostly PT-17s for training, as recovery after the war has not been easy. In addition, it has its own train station and a railway line between Shanghai and Jianqiao, used exclusively for transporting goods.

### A Glimpse of School Affairs

The Air Force Academy's educational affairs are divided into four departments: (1) The Flight Department, where elementary training lasts for six months, divided into four stages. Preliminary flight training requires 70 hours, and 250 hours must be flown by graduation. (2) The Instruction Department, which is responsible for academic education. (3) The Station Affairs Department, which is responsible for the construction, security, and flight training of the four airfields in Jianqiao, Xixing, Qiaosi, and Jiaxing. (4) The Translation Department, which translates teaching materials, publishes publications, and compiles an aviation dictionary.

The Political Department is responsible for political education, moral education, spiritual training, assessment and anti-espionage, small group discussions, academic research, and recreational activities.

The Business Department is divided into: (1) Provisions. In addition to food, clothing, laundry, and haircuts, which are all provided by the school, each student receives a monthly allowance of about 40,000 yuan. (2) Clothing, which is divided into special and ordinary equipment. (3) Pensions.

The Health Department has an outpatient clinic, airfield rescue, physical examinations, environmental health, and a hospital. Other facilities, such as repair factories and air force radio stations, are also well-equipped. There are more than thirty female nurses and female staff members in the school.

### Musical Performance: The Audience Was Silent

Unfortunately, it was a holiday on National Day, and the students were scattered, so we were unable to see their classroom and extracurricular activities. However, the evening's musical performance left the most brilliant page in the history of this year's National Day celebration at the Air Force Academy. On a stage with harmonious colors and soft lighting, we listened to Miss Feiman'er's violin solo, soprano solos, renowned violist Professor Pudu Xiga's viola performance, and Mr. Qi Naiqun's bass solo. The most hardworking was Miss Zeng Huixi's piano performance, as she accompanied all the performances from beginning to end, in addition to her two solo pieces. Each performance was very wonderful and beautiful, so it's no wonder that the hundreds of audience members were silent, all captivated.

It was a night of bright moonlight, and everything was quiet in the Air Force Academy. Only the gentle breeze rustled, and the autumn night under the moon in Jianqiao seemed even more poetic and moving, instantly making you forget the troubles of the world. Compared to the turbid and noisy Shanghai, it was truly like the difference between heaven and a filthy pond.

To the sound of horses' hooves, we saw Jianqiao's beautiful early morning again, and the sound of planes in the sky came closer and closer. The reporters took advantage of the morning to row boats on West Lake, which is twenty miles from the school. In the afternoon, we hurried back to the airfield and returned to Shanghai. However, everyone cherished a deep affection for the magnificent and beautiful "Cradle of the Air Force." Every corner of Jianqiao is lovely. May it "rise like the sun" and continue to flourish!

### Xi'an Forms People's Self-Defense Corps

— Xi'an, September 14 (Our Special Correspondent Li Chi)

From reports from various places, we see that people's self-defense corps or similar organizations have been established in many parts of the country. Xi'an is no exception, and 7,000 citizens have been organized into the first group and have already completed training. In addition to the city's self-defense corps, there is also the Chang'an County People's Self-Defense Headquarters. The former is headed by Kong Lingxun, the Xi'an Garrison Commander, who assumed both positions in August. The latter is headed by Wang Dingbang, and each of the county's 31 townships has a battalion.

The establishment of the Xi'an City People's Self-Defense Headquarters coincided with the anniversary of Japan's surrender on August 13. The fact that a people's self-defense force was still needed a year after Japan's defeat naturally had other reasons. Everyone remembers that in early August, Li Xiannian's troops entered the southeastern corner of Shaanxi from Henan. This was followed by various rumors that were difficult for the general public to discern. Later, we saw that several county magistrates within the province were explicitly punished. Zhou Mengfei, the magistrate of Zhashui County, was demoted and retained for "acting rashly and panicking without clarifying the situation when bandits disturbed the border, failing to fulfill his duties." The county's police chief was also dismissed for "withdrawing without authorization and abandoning his post." Zhao Wenbin, the magistrate of Zhen'an County, was detained and prosecuted for "leaving his post without authorization, abandoning his duties, and causing major negligence." These official documents not only supplemented the inadequacies of the semi-official news reports at the time.

The clearest explanation can be found in an excerpt from a speech by Shaanxi Province Chairman Zhu Shaozhou at the inaugural ceremony of the City People's Self-Defense Headquarters: "...Why do we need to defend ourselves?... First, the Communist Party troops do not listen to the Central Government's orders and roam around everywhere. Li Xiannian's troops even entered our province from Henan and intend to harass Guanzhong. We must protect our lives and property, so we must rise up and defend ourselves. Second, thugs and bandits are disrupting local security. Law-abiding citizens must defend themselves..." This statement is much more concrete than the two missions listed at the beginning of the "Xi'an City People's Self-Defense Corps Regulations." The "Regulations" only state: "The missions of the People's Self-Defense Corps are two: first, to strengthen city defenses; and second, to permanently maintain social order and urban security."

According to the latest statistics at the end of August this year, the population of Xi'an City has increased again to 540,000, with men accounting for three-fifths, or 330,000. How many of these 330,000 men are able-bodied and meet the age requirements stipulated by the "Regulations" (i.e., 20 to 40 years old)? A rough estimate would be that, excluding the majority of men under 20 and over 40, the total number of able-bodied men is around 100,000. The original plan was to train 20,000 of these in three phases. Once this plan is completed in two or three months, the numbers indicate that one out of every five able-bodied men will be in the Self-Defense Headquarters. This is a very high ratio. In addition, there are garrison troops, officer corps, guard units, police, etc., which are already sufficient to maintain local security. The "Regulations" meticulously define the categories of those who are required to train, those who are exempt, and those who are deferred. From the reporter's perspective, it is much more comprehensive than the "People's Militia" or "National Defense Corps" in Guangxi. If this kind of organization could have been widely implemented across the country eight or nine years ago, it would certainly have increased the people's ability to resist the enemy many times over. This principle has been proven by sufficient facts: the maximum mobilization of the people's self-defense power must be when the purpose of using this power is fully aligned with the interests and demands of the entire people.

The 20,000 able-bodied men in the city who are receiving training will be divided into twelve battalions and forty-seven companies according to the police bureau's twelve jurisdictions. Each battalion and company will have a political instructor in addition to the commander. For convenience of training, these 20,000 men will be divided into three phases, with 7,000 in each phase. To date, one-third, or the first phase, has completed training. A recruit must complete 60 hours of training during the training period to graduate. Training time is from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM in the city and from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the suburbs. In other words, recruits must train for two hours a day for thirty days to complete the program. The "Regulations" also stipulate that "recruits may not use the name or opportunity of training to solicit training subsidies or goods from neighborhood associations, residents, agencies, schools, factories, or shops." However, "factory workers whose training time overlaps with a daily work schedule of ten to twelve hours will be paid twelve hours' wages by the factory; workers whose work schedule is less than ten hours will only receive ten hours' wages." Also, "if wages are calculated based on the quantity of work (e.g., spinning a certain amount of yarn, weaving a certain amount of cloth), the headquarters will negotiate with the factory to decide on the amount."

Even monks and Taoists are not exempt if they are able-bodied men; there are no exceptions for freelancers. However, doctors will participate in the protective corps and be organized into rescue teams; lawyers, accountants, and reporters will have separate procedures. Because most reporters "work at night and rest during the day," it is difficult for them to rush to the training ground at 6:00 AM. They may be organized into a separate team in the second phase, which will begin at the beginning of next month. Commander Kong Lingxun told the local press in a serious tone: "In order to implement national laws and respect the equality of citizens, you must undergo this training!" During the War of Resistance Against Japan, news reporters enjoyed "exemption from military service," but they do not have this "privilege" this time.

In order to strengthen security in the city, in addition to intensifying the training of self-defense corps recruits, a strict household registration check is being conducted recently (even the garrison commander is personally conducting spot checks of senior officials' residences as a demonstration). Starting yesterday, registration of self-defense weapons began. In addition, the provincial authorities have been ordered to set up new conscription districts. There are two divisional headquarters in the province, located in Xi'an and Nanzheng, and five regimental headquarters, located in Xi'an, Nanzheng, Dali, Baoji, and Ankang.

As for national compulsory labor service, it will also be implemented in the city soon. Each person will perform labor for ten days each year. Men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five will be engaged in road construction, water conservancy, self-defense, local productive enterprises, and other local public welfare projects. However, according to the "Regulations" of the Self-Defense Headquarters, in principle, during the training period, able-bodied men will only participate in one type of organization, receive one type of training, and perform one type of service. Self-Defense Corps recruits will of course be exempt from compulsory labor service.

### Characteristics of the New Conscription Law

— Chuzi Diao

The new conscription law was promulgated on Double Ten Day. The Republic of China's conscription law, since its promulgation by the National Government in June 1933 and its implementation in March 1936, has a history of ten years. It has been amended twice, once in March 1943, during the height of the War of Resistance. This is the second time. The main principle of this amendment is to establish the foundation for national defense and military construction. The National Government stated clearly in its resumption of conscription order, "To survive today, it is necessary to consolidate national defense, and to enrich national strength, it is essential to implement a conscription system." Therefore, "the original conscription laws and regulations have been revised, and the divisions and regimental districts have been re-established, focusing on national defense needs to determine a peacetime conscription system." From this, it can be seen that the newly promulgated conscription law is the basic law for establishing a peacetime conscription system, containing permanent characteristics and differing in purpose from wartime conscription. All citizens of the Republic of China have the obligation to perform military service. Now that the suspension of conscription has ended, the National Government has explicitly ordered the resumption of continuous conscription. Everyone is related to this new conscription law and should recognize its significance and understand its content. Therefore, the characteristics of the new conscription law are specifically discussed as follows:

First, the new conscription law is non-partisan and purely nationalized. The most satisfying aspect of this revision of the conscription law is that it adheres to the principle of nationalization of the military, truly realizing the separation of the military from political party activities and making it purely nationalized. National unity is a necessary condition for establishing a country, and its only prerequisite is to prevent any one party from possessing an independent army to use force as a tool for political struggle, thereby ensuring that there is no army outside the national army and no military force outside national defense. Only when such a state can be achieved can social stability and people's freedom be guaranteed, and political democratization will not fail. If there are two opposing armies within a country, forming a situation of armed separatism, then it cannot be called a truly unified country. Therefore, Article 30, Paragraph 3 of the new conscription law stipulates: "Conscripts and draftees shall not participate in any gatherings or associations without the permission of their superiors, and those who have already participated shall suspend their activities during their service," so that the military is non-partisan and soldiers are non-partisan. In the old conscription law, Article 1 of the same article originally stipulated the sentence "should swear allegiance to the National Government of the Republic of China," but because the National Government returned power to the people, it is not yet known whether it still has (the old term) any suspicion of forcing conscripts and draftees to be loyal to the Kuomintang, so it was also automatically deleted and changed to "should swear allegiance to the Government of the Republic of China." The fairness and generosity of the National Government's demeanor, as well as its sincerity and eagerness for peaceful unification, can be seen here. Therefore, I dare to say that the new conscription law is non-partisan and is the fundamental law for implementing the nationalization of the military.

Second, the new conscription law is based on the principle of equality between men and women and encourages women to serve in the military.

In China's political status, equality between men and women has long been established, and the rights and obligations that women should enjoy and fulfill should be the same as those of men according to legal principles. In other words, men perform military service, and women should also perform military service. This is not an ideal or a high-sounding statement, as the facts of this world war can prove. According to a 1944 U.S. women's news report, the United States had women's auxiliary corps in the army and navy, each with 100,000 people, and the Coast Guard and Marine Corps women's teams each had 25,000 people. At the end of the war, it was estimated that 250,000 women were discharged from the military. Some members of the U.S. Congress even proposed that women's colleges like West Point and Annapolis be established specifically for women to train them to take on regular work in the military. Therefore, women serving in the military is an inevitable trend in the future. The original draft of the conscription law amended in 1943 stipulated that "women who meet the conscription age may be conscripted to perform military auxiliary duties in wartime." There was no explicit provision on what should be done in peacetime. When the Ministry of National Defense revised it this time, it specifically added "military auxiliary service education may be implemented in peacetime" so that service in wartime can be competent and pleasant. However, when the Legislative Yuan's example meeting deliberated, it was considered that my country's education has not yet been popularized, and there are more illiterate women, so it is feared that it would be difficult to universally force the implementation of military auxiliary service education in practice. Therefore, the four words "according to their wishes" were specifically added, and Article 33 of the new conscription law was changed to "Women who meet the age specified in Article 3 of this Law may be given appropriate military auxiliary service education according to their wishes in peacetime, and may be conscripted to perform military auxiliary service in wartime, and the conscription service shall be determined by law separately." This completely depends on the wishes of the women themselves and does not force them, so it can be suitable for the national conditions. Since military service is the glorious obligation that citizens should fulfill, it is hoped that loyal and courageous knowledgeable women will work hard, actively receive training, and prepare for service in wartime.

Third, the new conscription law raises the status and qualifications of those who perform military service. Military service is an obligation that citizens should fulfill. Teaching about shame and fighting, and defending the country are the most honorable undertakings. Therefore, only healthy citizens are qualified to participate. The erroneous idea of "good iron is not used for nails, good people do not become soldiers" must be completely eradicated. Only those who are not allowed to participate in military service are a great shame and humiliation. In the new conscription law, although the positive qualifications for performing military service only stipulate (1) nationality—must be a citizen of the Republic of China, (2) gender—male, (3) age—full 18 to 45 years old, there are no other strict conditions. However, in terms of negative qualifications, (1) those with physical deformities, disabilities, or chronic diseases are exempt from military service; (2) those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than seven years are prohibited from military service. Compared with the original draft of the conscription law amended in 1943, which stipulated that "those sentenced to life imprisonment or deprived of public rights for life are prohibited from military service," the standard for prohibiting military service is much higher, and it is also stipulated that those sentenced to imprisonment or deprived of public rights who have been approved shall be suspended from military service. Good citizens are the foundation of good soldiers, and good soldiers are the model of good citizens. Such amendments to the new conscription law are necessary.

Fourth, the new conscription law tightens the scope of deferred conscription and delayed enlistment. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the implementation of conscription was in accordance with the conscription law promulgated in June 1933, which had only eight articles in full, and authorized the administrative organs to decide on all decisions on deferred conscription and delayed enlistment, taking into account the actual circumstances. Therefore, at that time, the scope of deferred conscription and delayed enlistment was extremely broad, resulting in the formation of a situation where the rich did not become soldiers, the powerful did not become soldiers, and the knowledgeable did not become soldiers, which was far from the three principles of equality, fairness, and averaging. At the same time, it gave those who carried out military service the opportunity to commit fraud. When the conscription law was amended in 1943, it was specifically stipulated in writing to restrict it. This time, the new conscription law tightens it even more. For example, the conditions for delayed enlistment originally had six items, but the new conscription law only adopts three items, namely (1) those who go abroad on official business, (2) students above high school who have not graduated, and (3) those who are being prosecuted for serious crimes. And the remaining three items, namely (1) those whose physical illness makes them unable to move, and who have been proven to be true, (2) those whose direct relatives or spouses have died for less than one month, and (3) those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of the family without siblings, are all deleted. In addition, the conditions for deferred conscription have also deleted the original two items in the conscription law amended in 1943: (1) those who are currently serving as recommended officials or above and have been qualified by the銓叙, and (2) those who are currently serving as regular police officers. This regulation has at least three advantages: first, there are fewer exceptions, which can make it appear more equal, fair, and average; second, the source of soldiers is wide, which can increase the number of outstanding people serving in the military; and the biggest advantage is the third, which can reduce the opportunity for military service personnel to commit fraud. Because the scope of deferred conscription and delayed enlistment is wide and there are many conditions, it is possible to change and cheat from it.

Fifth, the new conscription law adjusts the rights enjoyed by those who perform military service. The conscription law amended in 1943 was implemented during wartime, so the rights enjoyed by active soldiers had to be specially favored to encourage them. Such as (1) debts incurred before enlistment, when unable to pay, may be extended to be paid within two years after the expiration of the service period, (2) spouses and direct relatives may enjoy preferential treatment for living relief; (3) after discharge, they have the priority to fill positions in institutions, legal entities, schools, and factories; (4) the rights that should be enjoyed under meritorious awards, pensions, and other laws and regulations. Except for the fourth item, the above seem to be too generous in peacetime. The new conscription law limits the rights enjoyed by active soldiers to "serving in the military for the country." If they are fighting for territory for private individuals or acting as tools for political parties, they are not included. Relief for the lives of spouses and direct relatives should be provided only when they are performing combat duties and their families are indeed unable to maintain their livelihoods. As for the item "after discharge, they have the 'right' to priority to fill positions in institutions, legal entities, schools, and factories," it is also inconsistent with the principle of making the best use of talents and is quite difficult to achieve. The difficulty of changing the ban on veterans is proof of this. Therefore, the new conscription law has been changed to "Students who are enlisted and should be enlisted shall be allowed to retain their student status, and employees shall be allowed to retain their original positions. Unemployed persons shall have the right to priority employment after discharge and repatriation." As for the repayment of debts, it should be based on the Civil Code and general regulations, so it is no longer adopted. After the conscription system is universally implemented, the whole country will be soldiers, and everyone will be the same. There should no longer be special regulations on the enjoyment of private rights.

Sixth, the new conscription law divides into three types: standing military service, supplementary military service, and national military service.

In the past, military service was only divided into two types: national military service and standing military service. The new conscription law adds a supplementary military service type. Article 8 of the new conscription law stipulates that supplementary military service is divided into two types: active service and reserve service. Active service: All men who meet the excess number of standing soldiers in active service shall be conscripted into the camp each year according to national defense needs, and the standing division or管區 shall give them four to six months of training. At the end of the period, they shall be discharged from the army and serve in the reserve until they reach the age of 45 and are discharged from service. This regulation is a supplement to standing military service. Because the country's financial resources are limited, it cannot conscript a large number of young men of the right age to serve in the standing army in peacetime. It can only draw a part of those who have passed the conscription inspection into the camp by lottery. However, once a problem occurs in national defense and a large number of soldiers are needed, if the national army is used as a supplement, the quality seems to be too poor. Therefore, a supplementary military service level is added, and they are enlisted into the camp to receive four to six months of military training to prepare for supplementary service at any time. Taking into account both peacetime and wartime is a progressive step.

Seventh, the new conscription law re-plans the management organization. The military service system, which supplies combat soldiers, is the only way to build a strong country and is the foundation of all military administration. Therefore, it should be handled uniformly by the central government, maintaining an independent organization and system, without resorting to local governments. In the past, military管區s were set up in provinces, and division and regimental管區s were set up below the provinces. The scope of the管區s was consistent with the local administrative regions, rather than based on the population. As a result, the distribution of兵額 was quite different, and the power was in the hands of the provincial chairman兼military管區 commander. Therefore, this time, the new conscription law re-establishes the institutions of各管區, cancels the military管區 system, and divides the country into several division管區s and regimental管區s based on population, sets up division and regimental管區 command headquarters, which are under the command and supervision of the常地 military senior organs, and separately handle military service and related affairs within their respective管區s (see Article 16). The county magistrate and city mayor are the county and city conscription officers, and are under the command and supervision of the 管區 commander, handling military service and related affairs within the district, which are completely entrusted matters. The provincial governor and the mayor of the院轄市 are conscription supervisors, who are only responsible for assistance and are no longer military 管區 commanders, so as to maintain an independent military service system and be less constrained by local governments. Exclusive power集巾 is one of its characteristics.

Eighth, the new conscription law pays special attention to the development of the navy and air force. The navy and air force should be given special attention in national defense, for reasons that are very obvious and need not be stated. The physical strength: intelligence standards of naval and air force personnel need to be particularly strict, which is also a fact. In the past revised conscription laws, it can be said that the army's conscription was the main body, and the navy and air force were only lightly mentioned in the appendix with a clause such as "Except for the special provisions of the law, the provisions of this law shall apply mutatis mutandis to the conscription of the navy and air force." In the new conscription law, a special chapter is listed for the navy and air force, and it is clearly stipulated that "Those who meet the requirements for standing 丘 active service, and whose physical and intellectual abilities meet the requirements for naval and air force officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers, may be given priority to be conscripted as volunteers. If the number of volunteers is insufficient for the conscription quota, the qualified persons may be determined by lottery." The inclusion of naval and air force conscription in a special chapter is the first time, and its emphasis on the navy and air force can be imagined.

In short, the conscription law is the great law of the country, and it is the foundation for the country to establish the army. Its importance is no less than that of the military regulations. This revision of the new conscription law makes it the most precious and great code that is not restricted by time and space, nor is it affected by politics. At the same time, the nationalization of the army also takes this as its foundation. We admire the non-partisan demeanor of the National Government's legislation, and the general public should recognize the importance of the new conscription law and its characteristics, faithfully abide by it, and actively enlist to establish the foundation for national defense and military construction.

Production and Construction

### A Retrospect on the American Industrial Revolution

— Yan Haoying

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when Europeans migrated to the Americas, they must have brought the handcraft methods used in Europe to America, which is a very natural fact. When the Industrial Revolution occurred, the Europeans were bound to bring the newly invented manufacturing methods to America, which is also very natural. However, the British government quickly saw the commercial benefits of these new machines and issued strict orders prohibiting the export of various machine drawings to foreign countries or colonies—so the American people had to work hard to seek the invention of various new machines, but there were no significant achievements. It was not until 1790 that Samuel Slater constructed several Arkwright spinning machines for the Almy and Brown factory in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, that it could be considered somewhat successful. Slater was a young Englishman who had previously worked with Strutt, a colleague of Arkwright, so he had some experience with this type of machine. The spinning machine he built could rotate 72 spindles at a time, and the appearance of the factory was very spectacular. In addition, nine spinning machines were constructed elsewhere at the same time, but none of them had such significant achievements as Slater's. Therefore, Slater's factory was regarded as the embryo of the American factory system, and Slater was regarded as the ancestor of the American manufacturing industry. As for the factory that can weave cloth from raw materials in one factory, the Woltham factory built in 1814 is considered the earliest in the world.

These early factories were of course modeled on the British method, and the size of the scale was often limited by the available water power. Although the people in that area showed special industrial skills very early, which made the reputation of New England even more prominent. However, manual craftsmanship and manual industry continued to prosper in other occupations for several years, and the development of the new factory system was also relatively slow in the early 19th century.

The earliest and most reliable report on the industrial situation at this time is the census report at the end of 1850. At this time, the word "manufacturing" still broadly included any machine work, and in addition to organized factories, it also included the建築 industry and handicraft industry. According to this report, the total value of industrial products during this period was US$500 million, and the average output of all factories in 1849 was US$4,300. In addition, other characteristics of modern industrial life gradually laid the foundation at that time. For example, the commercial class engaged in domestic and foreign trade developed at this time; and the various combinations of manufacturing, transportation, wholesale, and retail industries commonly seen in our modern industrial life were also discovered one by one at this time. And when the scope of commerce gradually expanded and the scale of industry gradually developed, those entrepreneurs who specialized in providing capital for industrial and commercial enterprises also arose in response to the tension of financial problems.

In the second half of the 19th century, the American Wang industry suddenly developed, both in terms of the value and quantity of its products. The country leapt from the status of a nascent industry to the position of world leader, but this situation was not without reason. First, because the country's population increased sharply, the domestic market naturally could not but expand accordingly. Second, because the country had been completely developed at this time, natural raw materials were very abundant, and the yield of arable land and coal mines was extremely sufficient. Third, and most importantly, on the one hand, because the country's desire for progress made inventors, engineers, and manufacturers aware of the importance of handicraft transfer principles. On the other hand, because of the country's open and frank attitude, the best technologies of other countries were continuously introduced to the United States. Therefore, in the end, the country was able to develop a large-scale production method to make the most of various newly invented manufacturing methods and to further expand the use of the division of labor system. We only need to see the country's tables, sewing machines, reapers, automobiles, and other manufacturing to know the various characteristics of the country's manufacturing, such as the huge number of products, the uniformity of product standards, and the interchangeability of product parts, which are very different from the European methods that still mostly rely on handicrafts. Therefore, in 1899, the total value of American manufactured products reached 10,000,000,000 yuan, of which less than one-tenth was made by hand. The world of large enterprises can be said to have begun. By 1904, 79% of the manufactured products in the United States were manufactured by factories with an annual output of more than 100,000 yuan. In 1914, this proportion increased to 84.6%.

There is a very important reason why the American factory system was able to make rapid progress during this period, that is, the invention of the steam engine has made it possible to expand the scale of a factory without limit. The impact of this reason is even more obvious after the invention of the generator and the Electrical Diotribution of Energy, because these methods and electric lights have fundamentally reformed the construction of factories, which is more advanced than the factories that relied entirely on water power to turn machines a hundred years ago. In addition, the application of steam engines to land and water transportation is also a very important advancement, which not only helps the marketing of manufactured products, but also makes it more convenient to transport raw materials to industrial centers. Therefore, in the beginning, although all kinds of newly invented textile machines had to rely on water power, and water power was also the only ability that could be obtained at that time, the location of the factory did not have to be near the water after the invention of the steam engine. Moreover, since the transportation method has been improved, not only can the gathering of workers and the concentration of machinery be managed in operation, but also the completed manufactured products can be more easily distributed to various places, which is another benefit in addition to increasing the efficiency of the production method. In addition, in the past, because of the inconvenience of transportation, handicraft workers in various places far away from the factory could often compete with the factory; now this competition has also disappeared invisibly. However, the transportation method itself often progresses with the advancement of the production method, because since the production method has been improved, people also use new production methods to construct transportation machinery.

In addition to the above inventions, we must also add telegraphs, telephones, wireless machines, and other improved means of transportation. These things have the possibility of being applied in commerce, and are almost daily necessities and conveniences for all people; however, the reason why their use can be so universal still depends on modern production methods. Therefore, the progress of transportation and transportation can certainly help the improvement of production methods, and the improvement of production methods can turn around to make the efficiency of transportation and transportation even higher; the extraordinary development of these production machine distribution systems is really something that people in the past had never seen. In other words, the evolution of production tools and the evolution of transportation methods were originally the earliest three major problems that encouraged people to strive forward. Now these things have developed to a degree that our ancestors had never dreamed of at the same time, and have developed the efficiency of the industrial system to a degree that is almost difficult for human power to control.

### Farm Income and Farmland Prices

— Translated by Zhong Deqi

The relationship between farmland market prices and farm income is extremely large, but our country pays very little attention to this issue. The author of this article, Ardron B. Lewis, is a famous American agricultural economist. He came to China in October 1933 to give lectures and participate in the "China Land Utilization" survey, serving as the chief statistician. He left his post in June 1936. He wrote a chapter on "Prices and Taxes" in "China Land Utilization." He is currently employed by the U.S. International Training Administration and is very concerned about China's agriculture. Now he specifically raises this issue to our country and hopes to conduct joint research and comparison with the United States. The translation is provided for reference by all parties. Translator's note.

Now that the war has been won, agricultural economists in China, the United States, and other countries can turn their full attention to various construction projects again, and particularly focus on permanent and mainly beneficial research. There are many agricultural economic facts whose relationships cannot be fully explained by management regulations. One of them is the relationship between farm income and farmland market prices. The results of my investigation in the United States before the war showed that the total value of farms—land, buildings, livestock, and tools—in different economic grades of land is proportional to the "Return prn man" of various grades of land (Translator's note: "Man" refers to "Man—cquivaleut"). The "Return prn man" is the total income divided by the total number of "Man years" (Translator's note: an adult male worker working 10 hours a day in the field is called an artificial unit. If he works all year round, he can be called an artificial year) obtained by the farm owner, farm landowner, and farm employees in the farm this year, often the field owner counts one "artificial year", and the farm owner counts one "artificial year", regardless of whether the field is owned by the farm owner or not.

If the above principle holds, then there are many interesting conclusions that follow. And those conclusions will affect the government's policies on agricultural loans, farm taxes, and land prices. To test this principle, two basic tools for agricultural economic research are needed, namely farm management survey records and land economic classification maps. The Department of Agricultural Economics of Jinling University has already done and used these tools in many studies, and will naturally continue to use them in the future.

In establishing agricultural economic principles, China and the United States should conduct joint research, and the agricultural economists of the two countries should continue to observe and correct each other's work. The principles established by the two countries are likely to be reliable; and any differences in the principles between the two countries will give us many lessons and lead us to discover even more distant truths.

### General Introduction to Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

Cost Accounting Meetings and Bookkeeping - Sixth Problem of Production Organizations

When discussing this type of work, we must first start with the order of implementation. When the management department notifies the production department to begin work, there must be a procedure. This procedure can be called a notification form. The number of notification forms can be determined according to the situation, but it is usually three: one for the production department, one for the cost accounting department, and one to be kept by the management department. The cost accounting department can then use this notification form as a basis, and then, based on the material requisition (a document that the production department uses to obtain materials from the warehouse), can record the required materials. Based on the wage payment slip, the wages used can be recorded. This item is relatively simple; what is more complex is the distribution of expenses.

Expenses can be divided into two types: fixed and variable. Rent, insurance, taxes, depreciation, light and heat, electricity, etc., can all be considered fixed. Even if there is an excess, it is a very limited amount. As for other items, they can be adjusted at any time.

There are several methods for allocating fixed expenses:

A. For rent expenses, calculate based on location. For example, if a factory has a total area of ​​so many square feet, the cost per square foot can be calculated from the rent paid. To illustrate with an example: A factory in the north has an area of ​​3,000 square feet, and the monthly rent paid is 30,000 yuan, then the average cost per square foot is 10 yuan. If the management department occupies an area of ​​500 square feet, then the management department should bear an expenditure of 5,000 yuan under the rent item. Conversely, 5,000 yuan is paid for the area occupied by the management department.

B. Expenses for lighting and heating are calculated based on location.

C. Electricity is calculated based on actual consumption and averaged.

D. Other items: determined according to the situation.

Example illustration:

Suppose we are manufacturing a product, and a batch totals 1,000 pieces. The expenses incurred are as follows:

1.  Raw materials (based on the actual consumption recorded in the material requisition): 50,000 yuan
2.  Wages (total manufacturing time is five days, with an average daily wage of 5,000 yuan): 25,000 yuan
3.  Expenses

Management (calculated for five days): 20,000 yuan

Rent (calculated for five days): 5,000 yuan

Insurance (calculated for five days): 1,000 yuan

Taxes (calculated for five days): 1,000 yuan

Depreciation (calculated for five days): 2,000 yuan

Light, heat and electricity (calculated for five days): 2,000 yuan

The total is 106,000 yuan, so the cost per piece of product is 106 yuan.

### Random Notes on Novels

— Zhenzi

The Complete Biography of Subduing Demons

"The Complete Biography of Subduing Demons" was written by a person of the Ming Dynasty. Sun Kaidi's "Bibliography of Chinese Popular Novels" Volume 2, "Historical Stories of the Ming and Qing Dynasties" records it, without volume or chapter numbers. It records: "Ma Yuqing's collection has a Ming edition, with only volumes two to five remaining, volume five ends at chapter sixty, and the total number of volumes and chapters in the book is unknown." It also says: "Written by an anonymous person of the Ming Dynasty, titled 'Compiled by Layman Qingyin of Wu Xing Hui Ji,' 'Reviewed by Lazy Immortal Resident Yinghai of Hongdu,' and 'Revised by Scholar Shuanglong Yanping of Pengcheng,' it narrates the rebellion of Xu Hongru during the Tianqi period." The "Bibliography" was completed in the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and only the incomplete Ma collection was seen. In the same year, Zheng of Changle first obtained the complete book in Peiping. The words "Eastern Yi" and "Tatar Slave" in the book were all dug out and changed, which should be a reprint from the early Qing Dynasty. The complete book has six volumes and seventy-two chapters, narrating the Shandong rebellion initiated by Xu Hongru, a member of the White Lotus Sect, in the second year of Tianqi, which spread throughout the country. The book is titled "Newly Compiled Popular Romance of the Imperial Ming Dynasty, The Complete Biography of Subduing Demons of the Seven Luminaries," but the beginning of the original book is titled "Newly Compiled Popular Romance of the Imperial Ming Dynasty, The Later Complete Volume One of the Subduing Demons of the Seven Luminaries." It is speculated that its initial name should be "The Later Biography of Subduing Demons," to continue "The Three Suis' Biography of Subduing Demons"; later it was renamed "The Complete Biography of Subduing Demons," and the word "Later" was dug out and changed to "Complete," but when digging out and changing volume one, one carelessly moved the next word down, thus mistakenly changing "Later Biography" to "Later Complete." At the beginning of the book is a preface by Wen Guangdou in the fourth year of Tianqi, Jiazi, so the time of completion should not be too far away, only two years away from Xu Hongru's rebellion, which was probably also a "newly heard" novel at the time. Wen's preface briefly describes the course of the rebellion, saying: "My friend Huiji, who has also witnessed the beginning and end of the matter, has written a biography to record the causes of its rise and fall, expressing praise and criticism through subtle language, setting up lodging to eliminate evil, and using magic to subdue demons. This uses illusion to replace illusion, borrowing the meaning of using falsehood to reveal truth." It also says: "Huiji, of the Wu Xing clan, is a descendant of Taishi Gong of Huainan Shizhou. He wanders the lakes and seas, laughs and is proud of the universe, storing hundreds of schools of thought within, and harmonizing nature and destiny within, a person beyond the world."

According to the book title "Layman Qingyin of Wu Xing Hui Ji," Qingyin Layman is a pseudonym, Huiji should be his given name or alias, and Wu Xing is the origin of the Shen family's lineage, so the author should be Shen Huiji. Since Huiji is a grandson of Shen Shizhou, there may be clues to be found. According to Shizhou, whose given name is Kun, a native of Huai'an, he was a Jinshi in the twentieth year of Jiajing, and was granted the title of Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, in the first rank, and was in charge of the Southern Hanlin Academy. When he was in mourning, he encountered the invasion of Japanese pirates, gathered local soldiers and defeated them greatly, but was later accused and went to the imperial prison. He wrote "The Collection of Shen Jijiu." Shizhou was a good friend of Wu Cheng'en. There are poems and prose such as "Gift to Shen Shizhou" and "Epitaph for the Joint Burial of the Hanlin Academy Compiler Ru Linlang Shen Gong" in "The Remaining Manuscripts of Sheyang." The "Epitaph" was written for Shizhou's father, Wei (written in Bingchen, the thirty-fifth year of Jiajing), which records Wei's descendants: "Three grandsons: Geng, engaged to the Lu family; Jia, engaged to the Jin family; Xin, engaged to the Zhang family." Wei's grandsons are Kun's grandsons, so Huiji's name should also be  口. These Geng, Jia, and other people are suspected to be Huiji's older brothers, not Huiji. When Wu wrote the "Epitaph," Shen Kun was only fifty years old (born in Dingmao, the second year of Zhengde, 1507 in the Western calendar, according to Fan Yixu's "A Scoop of Huai Flow" Volume Down, "After the Palace Examination Register of Shen Jijiu," calculated at the age of thirty-five during the provincial examination), his grandsons must have been very young. Assuming that Geng and the other three were ten years old at the time (already engaged), they would have been elderly men in their seventies when they wrote the novel in the fourth year of Tianqi, and probably would not have had such enthusiasm. Therefore, Huiji should be a younger brother of Geng and others, not yet born when Wu wrote the article, and there is no name in the lineage. The descendants of the Shen family are declining, and the genealogy has not been seen, otherwise it would not be difficult to investigate. Also, Shen Kun's article  Kai Cheng's collection has a manuscript, which was deliberately destroyed during the war. It has not been seen. I don't know if Huiji was mentioned in it?

### Translators of Manchu Novels

According to Sun Kaidi's "Bibliography of Chinese Popular Novels" Appendix (5) "Brief List of Manchu Translations of Novels," there are: "Former Seven Kingdoms," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Golden Lotus," "Water Margin," "A Jue Shi Ming," " Zhi," "Welcoming the City Walls," "Sai Hongsi," "Two Marriages," "Returning Lotus Dream," "Eight Immortals," "Three Teachings Novel" (three types), " History Romance," "Ping Shan Leng Yan," "Journey to the West," "Post-Journey to the West," eighteen types and four other books. Only "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" is titled Zakedan, and "Ke Xin Lu" is titled     , the rest are not written by the translator.

According to Sun's book, the translator can be known.

Chen Kangqi's "Yan Xia Xiang Cuo Lu" Volume 10 says: "Luo Guanzhong's "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" mostly draws materials from Chen  Xi's  Chi's book, which is not entirely fictitious. In the fourth year of Chongde, Emperor Taizong ordered Grand Secretary Dahai to translate "Mencius," "Comprehensive Mirror," "Six Secret Teachings," and also this book, but it was not completed. In the seventh year of Shunzhi, the Romance was completed, and Grand Secretary Fan Wensu Gong Wencheng and others  awarded  silver coins for their efforts. In the early years of the Qing Dynasty, many Manchu generals who did not know Chinese benefited from this." The translator of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is Dahai, Fan Wencheng, etc. It is suspected that Dahai and Fan Wencheng were in charge of the matter, and the entire book was not necessarily written by the two of them alone, because most of the books written in the inner court are signed with the name of the person in charge. It is also said that the Romance was completed in the seventh year of Shunzhi. According to the "Review," the Peiping Library and the Palace Museum each have a Manchu-Chinese joint  edition from the seventh year of Shunzhi, which should be the earliest printed edition of this book.

Ji Xiu Zhuren Zhao  "Xiao Ting Xu Lu" Volume 1 "Translation Room" says: "There is a household  Langzhong Heshu who translates extremely well. His translations of "Romance of the West Chamber" and "Golden Lotus" are accurate in every detail, and people scramble to recite them." According to this, the translator of the two books should be Heshu. However, Wu (son of Lana) in his "Annotated Edition of Suiyuan Poetry Talks" noted Xu in the original book Volume 5  Yuan's affairs and wrote: "The translation of "Golden Lotus" came from the hand of Xu Dieyuan, whose Manchu and Chinese were the best in the dynasty. Dieyuan's surname is Shumulu, a Manchu from the Zhengbai Banner, but although he and Yang Guli, a meritorious minister of the founding of the country from the Zheng Huang Banner, also have the surname Shumulu, they are not from the same clan." According to Yuan's "Poetry Talks," Xu Dieyuan's name is Yuanmeng, a Jinshi of Kangxi Guichou. This says that Xu translated it, which differs from Zhao's  statement. The "Bibliography" records that "Golden Lotus" has a carved edition from the forty-seventh year of Kangxi, which is in the same era as Xu Yuanmeng; the era of Heshu is unknown.  Searching for the Eight Banner documents, the problem is often not difficult to solve, but it is not easy to obtain books in southern China.

### Oar

— Shibei

In the Bund Park, I sat alone on a chair by the Huangpu River, quietly watching the turbulent river. Those densely lined, huge ships with fat bellies blocked the far side of the river, and black smoke billowed from the chimneys, obscuring the sky on one side; the flags waving in the air could not be seen, only the brightly lit electric lights could be seen. Many light and nimble motorboats, like shuttles on a spinning machine, kept bumping and splashing white waves, like a pile of tangled hemp, dragging behind them. In the middle of these high-spirited giant and lively small motorboats, was our small wooden boat, the only small boat powered by oars. It and those behemoths and jumping imps formed two distinct contrasts on the Huangpu River—one was sharp and the other was a somber mood.

A long, curved oar was tied to the back of the wooden boat. With this oar, the boat could be propelled forward or swayed left and right. At first, the father, mother, and young daughter were rowing. These six hands desperately held onto the ropes hanging from the oar, rowing and rowing, and their whole bodies swayed with the ropes. The waves crashed against their boat, and they looked ahead, unhurried and calm, rowing with all their might. After a while, the  old man at the stern of the boat also stood up and climbed onto the ropes, silently rowing the oar with them. This old man was probably the grandfather. His wrinkled, confused eyes stared at a motorboat rushing towards them from the front. A large wave surged, and their bodies were completely intertwined with the ropes.

I don't know why, but I only love this small wooden boat. My eyes follow its movements. Faced with these two discordant moods on the river, do I sympathize with the smallness of this small wooden boat, or am I worried about the fate of being overwhelmed by the waves? I can't express my feelings...

The old man's hair is already gray. He has been rowing this oar all his life, and now his descendants will have to row this oar! When will they be able to finish rowing? Their strength is exhausted, but the water on the river will never be still!

In my hometown in the south, to go from the countryside to the city, it is necessary to cross the river by small wooden boat. Every time I went to the city with my mother by boat, I loved to watch the two oars moving on the side of the boat, and I loved to listen to the old man rowing the oars tell about his life. The old man's son had another small wooden boat, and he also rowed oars for people every day. During the flood season in summer and autumn, we could see the old man's grandson standing at the bow of the boat helping to row the oars. I remember once my mother said to me: "They live by rowing an oar for three generations!" These distant memories have now been vividly recalled before my eyes.

Life is like a boundless ocean, and the oar is a living tool that each of us cannot lack. On the vast river, in the surging ocean, on the bustling land, ... all kinds of people grasp all kinds of different oars of life, and in order to survive, we keep rowing!

Recalling the old man rowing the oars in my hometown, and seeing the three generations rowing an oar in front of me, I want to muster up the courage and row my own oar!

### Farewell Dinner

— Xie Ziwen

### Remembering Xiang Peiliang

— Zhao Jingshen

Xiang Peiliang was a cadre of the Kuang Biao Society, and was as famous as Gao Changhong. A Ying's "Historical Material Index" (Chinese New Literature Series) says that he was "a playwright and critic from Qianyang, Hunan. He was the editor of the Qingchun Monthly. He wrote many works, the main ones being "The Art of Mankind," "A General Review of Chinese Drama," "Bright Drama," "Depressing Drama," "Purple Song Opera Collection," "Hero and Beauty," "I Left the Crossroads," etc." I once carefully read "A General Review of Chinese Drama," because at that time I was compiling "A Short History of Chinese Literature," and there were very few books that systematically discussed Chinese New Literature at that time, so this book especially made me pay attention and  like it.

A few days ago, he, with a  resembling Xu Dishan, his eyes bright and energetic, came to my house on crutches to see me. I was very interested in his crutches. I remember more than ten years ago, when we both lectured at the Women's Literary College in the city, he was already using a crutch. I said, "Have you used this crutch for more than ten years?" He said that he had taken it from his brother last year, and his own had been lost.

He talked about teaching at the Wuxi Guoxue Institute for several years, and followed the school everywhere to move, from Guilin to various places to escape the war. Once, he even escaped to the Yao people's cave. In addition to the Yao language, they could also speak the Guilin Mandarin, so there was no language barrier, and the custom of jumping the moon was also gone. I hope that he will record the local customs and customs, which must be very interesting and can broaden our horizons.

When Guozhuan moved back to Wuxi, he often met with Zhou Yibai. Guozhuan was very close to Zhou's residence, and there were not many friends in Wuxi, so their interactions were very close, and Yibai often talked to him about me.

Recently, Peiliang has been teaching drama courses at the Social Education College in Zhuozheng Garden, Suzhou, which is of course outstanding and suitable. I remember that  before, he taught art and aesthetics at an art college in Hankou for several years, and his research in this area was also quite profound.

### Autumn Night

— Xiaofeng

I turned on the lamp, sat close to the window, and listened attentively to the sound of the rain outside the window. I heard the wind of this autumn night shaking the bamboo bushes in the backyard, making a rustling sound. I heard the raindrops of this cold night dripping down from the eaves, knocking on the stone steps under the eaves one by one. In this windy and rainy autumn night, I began to feel desolate, lonely, and it aroused my infinite memories.

I remembered an autumn night eight years ago, on a muddy ancient road, my classmates and I groped in the dark. At that time, we were returning from propaganda in a small town, and the autumn rain drenched our clothes and shattered our "Anti-Japanese Propaganda Team" flag. Although we groped on this muddy road and fell into the muddy fields, our hearty singing and laughter, like our enthusiasm, burst forth.

I also remembered on a windy and rainy autumn night, I suffered the spurs of life, and walked alone on a deserted road. In that vast wilderness, there were no hotels, no lights, and I only had endless horror. Wandering in this vast dark night, how much I yearned for light and warmth! I hoped to avoid the wind and rain of this autumn night in a small thatched shed.

I lowered my head, closed my eyes, and thought silently. On this night after several years, I cherish the many old and bitter memories even more.

Suddenly, a faint moan floated in from outside the window, like someone sighing leisurely in this windy and rainy autumn night. I pushed open the window, poked my head out and looked around, wanting to find the source of this groan. The street had a desolate appearance, the light of the electric lamp seemed to have become dim, only a small military vehicle with a beam of light slowly drove past in the mud.

With the help of the faint light, I saw a row of winding houses on the opposite side, and a disheveled beggar curled up in the depths of the wall. When the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, he trembled slightly, trying to get his body closer to the wall, and faint moans replaced his deep curses.

In the middle of the night, when I woke up from a dream, the wind and rain had stopped, and a faint moonlight was seeping through the gaps in the paper window, sadly scattering on the desk. I closed my eyes and quietly listened to the world in the deep night. I heard the paulownia leaves outside the window drifting in the breeze, the rustling sound like the light sigh of an old man. The sad sound of the autumn insects was grieving for the misfortune of these withered leaves.

I heard again the faint groan coming from outside the window. I thought that this is the season of autumn, and behind the autumn season, there is a string of cold winter days hidden. Although winter has passed, spring will come, and the sunshine of spring will relieve  people's threats. However, this harsh season is still so long!

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 62

— Ye Jingfeng

I discussed with my brother Hu, and thought  to take a car, but not only was the price high, but it was also not guaranteed to be chartered. If we couldn't get through, we had to get  tickets, and they couldn't be refunded. As we were talking, we caught sight of a woman dressed like a countrywoman, walking straight to us and saying, "Excuse me," that she didn't recognize the words, and asked what time the car was on the sign. We carefully looked at the woman, and then I told her, "It's written seven o'clock, but the time has already passed. The tickets haven't been sold yet."

The woman muttered to herself, "More than forty miles, how can people walk? Wait then, the car will have to come anyway." As she spoke, she put her small handbag beside us and sat down on our chair. After a while, she asked us where we were going? Shuangqiao? Tongzhou? Are you siblings? Are they relatives? Or neighbors? We didn't pay much attention, and vaguely said they were relatives.

"You're probably going to Tongzhou?" She asked us again after a while. I was about to perfunctorily say something to her again, preparing to find another place to sit, when Hu Di lightly nudged me, suddenly stood up, pointed to the station canteen and said, "Auntie, let's go get something to eat." As he spoke, he picked up his small bag and my small suitcase and walked away. I nodded to the woman and followed him away.

We had originally discussed that from now on, Hu Di would call me elder sister, because I liked to call him younger brother Hu. But Hu Di was afraid that his mother would scold him when he went home, so he firmly refused. Even if he didn't call "Auntie Ji," he had to call "Auntie," eldest auntie, second auntie, third auntie. Later, he said that I was too young to be his mother, so he called me little auntie. At this time, he elbowed me with his hand, knowing that he must have seen something, so I had no choice but to ignore the woman.

We really sat down in the station canteen. Although we had eaten breakfast at the headquarters in the morning, we were afraid of being delayed, so we didn't feel like eating. At this time, the car hadn't come, so we wanted to make up for it. As for Hu Di, he could eat at any time, except when he was sound asleep, 24 hours a day, and he could eat non-stop.

We were just asking the waiter for some refreshments, and the waiter, while answering,  looked out the window. I followed him and looked out, but didn't see anything, only as if a figure flickered outside the window. The waiter left, and there were only  people in the canteen; although there were two or three  , they were standing far away. I then asked Hu Di "what's going on." Hu Di  told me that he hadn't guessed wrong at all, that the woman was good at cheating and wasn't  , and sure enough, when we came over, she also came to spy outside the window.

I admire Hu Di's ability to pay attention to everything, and he's not much worse than me, who has received special training. Originally, when that fellow walked over at first, I already felt that she was a bit off. Her clothes and dress probably hadn't undergone formal training, and she violated a basic taboo in detective disguise—uniformity—in other words, all disguise clothes must be consistent with one's own appearance, habits, movements, and other items. Therefore, detective disguise says; "Rather than disguise, if you can't achieve uniformity, it's better to be natural; therefore, unless it's absolutely necessary, and the attainment is quite deep, it's better to be natural." In other words, after disguising, you really have to take care of everything, and there can't be a single place that isn't uniform.

Who said that this fellow was dressed as a countrywoman, her hands were so tender, her nails and palm lines were so clean, that she hardly touched water except for washing her face. That kind of maintenance achievement was obviously there; the rest, such as the agility and sharpness of her eyes, the oily and tidy hair, the deliberate affectation of her actions, etc., were some countrywoman's means, simply like the imitation actions on the theatrical stage, so there was no need to observe more carefully.

According to my original intention, I wanted to joke with her, at least I should be indifferent and deal with it as it comes. Because when you encounter this kind of person, it's best to let it happen naturally; otherwise, any  movement or avoidance will instead prove it to her. No  Hu Di  discovered  the strangeness, and was impatient to deal with  her. Fortunately, our movements were very natural, so there was no need to make a fuss about it. As for the fellow running outside the window to spy, it shows that her skills are ordinary. But  Hu Di said that he had seen her make gestures to the  waiter in front.

### Root of Life

— Shaofu

General Feng Yuxiang has been assigned to the United States to investigate water conservancy. Before leaving, he wrote to Chairman Jiang, listing five points, the last of which said:

The moral climate is deteriorating, which is extremely dangerous. Many officials are corrupt, the administration is inefficient, the morale of the people is too low, and the culture is not developing. What is most obvious is the abandonment of military discipline and the decline of official norms. Today, officials deceive the people, and the military disturbs the people, doing whatever they want. Even in large cities, there are cases of police beating civilians, police fighting each other, and police clashing with each other everywhere. This is a matter of the root of life, which is not easy to cultivate in dozens or hundreds of years, but now it is swept away.

This passage is too painful. If we look through the newspapers of the past month, the many strike events of trams and buses in Shanghai can confirm that General Feng Yuxiang's words are based on ironclad facts.

General Feng calls himself a soldier. He came from the military and has decades of military life experience. He saw this situation and cried out "extremely dangerous," which is really serious!

The crux of the problem lies in education. Insufficient education makes it difficult for many people to understand reason. A smattering of knowledge is especially bad, because they will concoct a set of specious reasons to distort right and wrong. In addition to ignorance, there is also poverty. As the saying goes, extreme poverty leads to boredom. When a person is bored, what does he care about morality and law?

These are all social pathologies, and their impact will affect the whole. General Feng wrote to Chairman Jiang, asking him to "strive to prevent and correct them, in order to save them from the waves." I think we also have a responsibility. Everyone must be a do-gooder for morality and law, have the courage to sacrifice; and remove the incomplete self-concept of "don't care about the frost on other people's roofs."

Miscellaneous Thoughts on Current Affairs

### Overseas Chinese in Dutch East Indies: A Tale of Blood and Tears

— Foolish Old Man

— Seeing Off Special Envoy Li to the Dutch East Indies

Special Envoy Li Dijun to the Dutch East Indies has already departed on his journey. This is the first time the National Government has specially dispatched a high-ranking official to the Dutch East Indies. According to Mr. Li's statement to reporters before his departure, his mission is twofold: first, to offer spiritual comfort to the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies; and second, to investigate the sufferings and oppression endured by the local overseas Chinese, providing information for the government's reference. For hundreds of years, the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have suffered from the dual oppression of foreigners and indigenous people, and from the unequal treatment of the Dutch authorities. From the "Red River Massacre" in 1740 to the "Tangkilong Massacre" after the victory, and more recently, the continuous news of the murder of overseas Chinese in places like Bagan, when this old debt is carefully calculated, it is truly a tale of blood and tears, an endless story of sorrow and bitterness!

The southward migration of overseas Chinese to the Dutch East Indies began during the Tang and Song dynasties. During Zheng He's seven voyages to the South Seas in the Ming Dynasty, overseas Chinese already had considerable influence in the Dutch East Indies. Later, Java and Sumatra were occupied by the Dutch. Due to the need for manpower for development, overseas Chinese were welcomed to go there. Thanks to the perseverance and hard work of the overseas Chinese, who focused on business, their numbers increased daily and they dominated the commercial world, which aroused the jealousy of the Dutch, who often mistreated them. Dutch officials were accustomed to extorting money from the overseas Chinese. The Dutch believed that those without legitimate occupations should be subjected to torture or even thrown into the sea. In the historically tragic "Red River Massacre," over 10,000 overseas Chinese died. In principle, the Chinese government should have urgently sought countermeasures to protect the safety of the overseas Chinese, but at the time, the Qing Emperor Qianlong declared: "Overseas Chinese are not subjects of the Great Qing, and the court will not intervene."

Abuse and Slaughter

Since the founding of the Republic of China, the indiscriminate massacre of overseas Chinese has been repeatedly recorded. In 1927, Cen Julin, the executive member of the Kuomintang East Borneo branch, and Deng Qianhuai, the chairman of the Shengwashengwa sub-branch, were unreasonably arrested by Dutch police. Overseas Chinese demanded their release from the Dutch authorities, but were instead shot at, resulting in dozens of casualties and numerous arrests. Afterward, the National Government protested to the Dutch government, but the Netherlands ignored it, instead deporting Cen and Deng and imprisoning more than ten overseas Chinese.

The massacres and discrimination suffered by overseas Chinese were not only perpetrated by the Dutch. Local indigenous people, seeing that overseas Chinese had gained economic power, inevitably harbored resentment, and the Dutch further fueled the flames. As a result, the violence escalated. Acts of massacring overseas Chinese were frequently heard of, such as the famous "Kudus Massacre," in which eleven Chinese were killed, 500,000 guilders worth of property was looted, and nineteen houses were burned down. Afterward, the Dutch government did not compensate for the losses, and the Chinese consul was not allowed to interfere.

Since 1909, although China has had consuls stationed in various places in the Dutch East Indies, such as the approximate areas of swimming, cotton, and Padang, they had no diplomatic power to intervene and were merely symbolic. Moreover, the East Indies government had a "Chinese Affairs Department" that employed corrupt Chinese people to do evil, further exacerbating the suffering of the overseas Chinese!

Orphans Without a Mother

The regulations for overseas Chinese entering the Dutch East Indies were exceptionally harsh, and the procedures were extremely troublesome. First, they had to pay a so-called "population tax" of 100 guilders on the ship, find a guarantor, and obtain a "landing permit" before they could disembark. There were also procedures for guaranteeing wives and obtaining "Wang characters," which were so complicated that they made one's head spin. According to their "Entry and Residence Regulations," any overseas Chinese whom the Dutch government deemed "unable to make a living and support themselves" or "likely to endanger the law" could be arbitrarily refused entry. Mr. Cai Yuanpei was one such person who was denied entry under the pretext of "endangering public order."

There are as many as two million overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies, constituting a major part of the national life of the Dutch East Indies. Based on the principle of national self-determination, they, like the Indonesians, are masters of the Dutch East Indies, and they have lived there for hundreds of years. Calling themselves "overseas Chinese" is merely a matter of "politeness." Can such blatant bullying and discrimination be allowed to continue, leaving the overseas Chinese with no peace of mind?

This time, Mr. Li is going to the Dutch East Indies. The overseas Chinese there have suffered deeply from the ravages of war, and after the war, they were subjected to anti-Chinese massacres in Indonesia. There is certainly a need for a special envoy to offer comfort. It is hoped that after investigating the various sufferings endured by the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, Mr. Li will report to the government and promptly implement policies to protect the overseas Chinese, abolish all unequal treaties against the overseas Chinese, and guarantee the safety and freedom of the overseas Chinese!

### Song of a Merchant

— W.W.

Everyone has ears, but I alone have none. Stop the war, resume negotiations, I turn a deaf ear. Everyone has eyes, but I alone have none. The people are destitute, lacking warm clothing, I turn a blind eye. Everyone has a mouth, but I alone have none. Millions of hungry people, wailing for food, what is that to me? Let me buy US dollars instead.

### Letter from a Lolo Compatriot

— Li Li Arun

(Editor's note: After publishing Mr. Yi He's article "About the Lolo" on the 2nd, a Lolo compatriot, "Li Li Arun," believes that the section describing the Lolo killing Han compatriots is inaccurate. Based on the enthusiasm for unity, he submitted a letter to this publication, defending his people. We greatly cherish the enthusiasm of this Lolo compatriot and are publishing the original letter. However, we have reserved the overly critical parts of the letter directed towards the original author, because we hope that there will be no estrangement between our Lolo compatriots and us. Furthermore, we admire this Lolo youth for writing such fluent Chinese. With only a few minor adjustments, most of the text is from the original submission.)

Mr. Yi He:

I have seen two things about the Yi and Miao ethnic groups of the Southwest in the Shen Bao newspaper; one, there are conflicts between the Lolo tribes, and two, about the "Lolo" (published in Freedom Talk).

Not So Much

The first matter you did not mention, and it is irrelevant to this article, so we need not waste paper on it. Let us first discuss the second matter! You said, "The Lolo" take pride in killing Han people, and even use the heads of elderly Han people for sacrifices. I think this is a misunderstanding. (Omission) Although those with insufficient knowledge are somewhat barbaric, even the most uncivilized ethnic group in the world today, I think, would not be so unreasonable as that. Furthermore, since God brought me into this world into a Yi and Miao family, and I have lived in Yi and Miao areas for more than ten years, I have never seen such actions, nor have I heard of such rumors. Moreover, the Dragon Boat Festival is the only day of the year for Yi and Miao youths to express their love, which is a custom that differs from the Han people's and is superior to Western romance, because it does not cause young people to waste time or money on love. This is a sacred expression of chaste love. Except for the New Year and the Dragon Boat Festival, young men and women are all engaged in their respective duties, doing their best for humanity. The New Year is also a time for the year-long laborers to rest their muscles and bodies, so how can they have the patience to commit murder? As for young Han men being captured and becoming male spouses in the Yi and Miao areas, that is even more absurd and laughable. If this is what you have seen and heard yourself, then perhaps you are old and senile, and your mind is deranged, and your eyes are blind!

Now let me tell you some general information about our Yi and Miao people:

It can be said that our Yi and Miao people are worthy of the country, and how is that? Once I explain it, everyone will understand. The Yi and Miao people all live in mountainous areas, such as western Hunan, the entirety of Guizhou, the entirety of Ning County in Xikang, the entirety of Guangxi, northern Guangdong, and along the northwest and southwest to Hainan Island, western Sichuan, the entirety of Yunnan, southwestern Hubei, northern Fujian, and far abroad in northern Burma and northern Vietnam. Is that not where mountainous areas are located? However, they pay rent and taxes as usual, and perhaps even more than the Han people! As for military service, it is no exception.

A Heartfelt Loyalty

Despite this, the Yi and Miao people have never complained or protested. On the contrary, the Yi and Miao people all have a heartfelt loyalty to the country. I can also tell you that among the Yi and Miao youths in the Southwest, many have already graduated from university, many have graduated from high school, and many more are about to graduate; but none of them want to enter officialdom, and all of them are returning to do practical work. Running schools and reclaiming land are their consistent desires. But there are also many who have never seen a book or recognized a single word. There are even some who have studied diligently at missionary schools and dropped out after elementary school, middle school, or high school.

In recent years, I have only heard of the work of pacifying the Yi in the southwestern frontier, but there has been a lack of educational experimentation. (Omission) In short, the Yi and Miao youths are living in dire straits. Some of them have obtained elementary school, middle school, or high school degrees through part-time work and study, but few can actually pursue further studies, and they eventually go back to holding hoes, enduring all the warmth and coldness and contempt of life, and have never seen a glimmer of sympathy. Although the Founding Father personally stipulated that all ethnic groups within the country are equal, but that equality, in your article, although in the latter part it makes me very dissatisfied and angry, but because of the word "Lolo" you make such a defense, and appeal "do not discriminate against us" I dare to represent the Yi and Miao youths to thank you, and to guarantee to you and the elders of the whole country, as long as all ethnic groups in the country are equal, truly equal, in politics, economics, military, and in any aspect. The Yi and Miao youths are absolutely good citizens and good people of the country, if you do not believe me, please wait and see for yourselves for the arrival of true equality and see how it is? With this, I wish you peace. From the Yi and Miao youth Li Li Arun

### How Roosevelt Dealt with Stalin (1)

— Written by Frances Perkins, Translated by Ge Chunliang

(Note: This was written by a woman who worked with Roosevelt for thirty-five years. She was very close to him as a political colleague, a state government official, and a member of Congress. In this chapter, she narrates how Roosevelt won Stalin's heart.)

Franklin Roosevelt was not an ordinary person. The simple virtue that creates greatness and nobility was not all that he possessed. He was the most complex person I have ever known. In his complex nature, there was a strength that enabled him to advance on the path to creating great achievements, and there was an inexhaustible compassion that made him like those diverse people of different races, and at the same time, he was liked by them. There was also the ability to temporarily forget his many problems while watching a play or resting, and there was also the strength to constantly struggle in contradictions, which often made those who worked with him, those who hoped that he would have pre-science and an unwavering will, feel very confused. However, this complexity of nature gave him the insight and ideals to delve into the life experiences of those diverse people of different races, and even, in his later life, he took the physical, social, geographical, economic, and military conditions of those different races as his own responsibility.

One of the best examples to describe his talent is his meeting with Marshal Stalin at the Tehran Conference. The Russians intrigued and intrigued Roosevelt. He was unable to talk to the servants who came and went in the house. They served very thoughtfully, worked very diligently, and often smiled happily and temptingly, but they did not speak, not a single word. He still liked them very much.

He set out to like Stalin and was determined to make himself liked as well. When I wanted to discuss a particular piece of legislation in Congress with him, he told me the story of his encounter with Stalin. When I was talking about the legislation, his eyes were thoughtful, and his mind seemed to be elsewhere. He said 'Um! Um!'

Later, suddenly he turned his head, a common gesture of his, and said what he was thinking: 'You should know that the Russians are very interesting people. In the first three days, I made not a shred of progress. I simply could not get any private contact with Stalin, although I did everything he asked me to do. I lived in his embassy, attended his banquets, and was introduced to his ministers and generals. He is a precise, strong, and solemn man, but he doesn't smile often, and there is no human warmth that I can grasp.' (To be continued)

### Sun Ke, the Peace Advocate, the Political Commentator Who Rarely Speaks

— Zheng Fan

'When Hu Zhantang receives guests, only he speaks, and you don't. When ××× receives guests, he speaks as much as you do. Only Mr. Sun Zhesheng coldly faces guests, and if you don't speak, he doesn't speak either.' This was a very popular saying among reporters more than a decade ago. Mr. Sun Ke was originally a man of few words. He was always so quiet that the guests had to shut their mouths. However, due to various interactions and contacts, Mr. Sun is now an eloquent political commentator, although he may still not be very adept at greetings and pleasantries.

Sun's student days were entirely American-style education. He studied in Hawaii as a child. In the early years of the Republic of China, he studied in the United States at government expense, entered the University of California, graduated, and then entered Columbia University to study political and economic science, earning a master's degree. He excelled in his studies at school and was the president of the Chinese Students Association in the United States, assisting the Founding Father in promoting the revolution overseas with great effort. When he returned to China in 1917, he was not very familiar with Chinese. Therefore, some people have said: 'Mr. Gu Mengyu does not eat Chinese food, and Mr. Sun Zhesheng does not write Chinese characters.' When Sun was the mayor of Guangzhou and the Minister of Railways, he still signed official documents with a pen. Later, a friend advised him to use a brush to write, and he imitated the Founding Father's calligraphy and began to practice, and he actually learned it very similarly. From then on, he became very interested in brush calligraphy, often writing inscriptions for others, writing couplets, and writing epitaphs for people. If you compare Sun's signature-style "Sun" character with the Founding Father's signature-style "Sun" character, you will see that they are exactly the same.

Reporter Origin

There are countless leading figures in the party and the country who come from the journalism field, such as Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Dai Jitao, Yu Jingheng, and Chen Bulei. Sun also worked as a newspaper reporter. That was when he had just returned to China. He was the editor-in-chief of the Guangzhou Times and wrote many articles.

Sun is currently fifty-six years old, three years older than the Founding Father's wife, Ms. Soong Ching-ling. He has also been the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan for more than ten years, and his political achievements are beyond description. He has written many books, and his articles are also scattered in newspapers and magazines. His theories are extremely pertinent, and his research on Sino-Soviet relations is very in-depth. He has always advocated "Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation." He is the president of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association.

Very Like His Father

Sun's personality is similar to his father's in several ways. Everyone knows that the Founding Father's two great hobbies in life were "revolution and reading." In addition to engaging in revolution and construction, Sun's greatest hobby is "reading." In his private residence, there is an elegant and pleasant study with the inscription "Buzuzhai" (Insufficient Studio) by Mr. Wu Zhihui. There is also a couplet: "Cultivate the spirit of integrity, read useful books." He has a very rich collection of books on international issues, political parties, politics, economics, and society. In addition to reading, horseback riding, swimming, visiting scenic spots, and collecting calligraphy and paintings are also his secondary hobbies.

Not long ago, Sun celebrated the birthday of his birth mother, Madam Lu. Madam Lu is now eighty years old and still in good health. Sun is more irritable, but he is very accommodating to Madam Lu.

In today's world of widespread war, Sun is one of the most ardent advocates of peace. Recently, the leaders of the Third Force in Shanghai invited Sun to come forward and mediate the situation, and Sun has reluctantly agreed. I hope that Sun will do his best to make the greatest effort for peace!
