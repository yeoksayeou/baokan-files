### With the Spirit of "Sword and Shoes": Completing Restoration and Construction: Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Political Address at the Political Council

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Chairman Chiang delivered an address at the opening ceremony of the Fourth Session, Second Plenary Meeting of the Political Council on the morning of the 20th. The full text is as follows:

Chairman, Honorable Councilors:

Today is the first day of the Fourth Session, Second Plenary Meeting of the Political Council. After a long separation, I am very pleased to gather with you again. Our Political Council has made particularly great contributions to upholding the national policy of resistance and assisting in the success of the war of resistance. Today, I would like to express to your council that the contributions of our eight-year war of resistance, the entire population, and all officers and soldiers who shed blood and sacrificed for the country and the nation will be immortal. In addition, there are two points that are important factors in achieving our sustained success in the war of resistance. First, during the war of resistance, our Political Council united its will, concentrated its strength, did not flinch from any difficulties, and unswervingly upheld the national policy of resistance to the end, ultimately achieving success. Secondly, I cannot but mention Sichuan, the important base area for the war of resistance, which contributed the most manpower and material resources, and the men, women, old, and young compatriots in Chongqing endured the enemy's fiercest bombings, not hesitating to sacrifice all life and property, sharing life and death with the government, persevering, and striving again and again. Their praiseworthy integrity is truly enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and spirits weep. These are all merits worthy of great writing in the history of the war of resistance, and they are also what I have personally experienced and will never forget. Therefore, today, after the victorious end of the war of resistance, I want to express my admiration for the compatriots in Sichuan, and I want to pay the highest respect to the Political Council.

The last meeting of the Political Council was held on the anniversary of the July 7th Incident last year. At that time, I expressed my deep expectations for your council to strive for national freedom, safeguard national independence, accelerate the collapse of the enemy, and establish a constitutional structure. Shortly after the last meeting, Japan surrendered unconditionally, and our war of resistance finally came to a victorious end. What has not yet been completed now is the issue of post-war restoration and rehabilitation, restoring transportation, stabilizing the locality, relieving the people's suffering, and implementing constitutional government to complete the task of national construction. This meeting of your council is particularly significant and the task is particularly arduous, as it is held after the victorious end of the war of resistance and just before the convening of the National Assembly, the promulgation of the constitution, and the implementation of constitutional government.

The administrative measures of various government departments will be reported to your council by the heads of the respective departments. What I want to raise to your council is the national environment after the war and the progress of the restoration work. Before the end of the war of resistance, I often said that the work after the war would be even more difficult than during the war. We have been at war for such a long time, and the damage in the war zones is so severe. Once the restoration begins, the wartime system must be changed to peacetime, the manpower, material resources, and land that have undergone great destruction and damage must be recovered, and the places that have been ravaged by the enemy and puppets for a long time must be restored to order. There are thousands of things to be done, and the work is complicated. What's more, we still have to suffer from various internal obstacles and difficulties. First of all, military orders and government orders cannot be completely unified. Secondly, the transportation equipment for restoration is seriously damaged before and after the victory. Those who do not understand the government's situation and difficulties use various methods to obstruct the progress of the restoration work. In addition, there is a lack of talent and material preparation required for the restoration work, which makes the restoration work prolonged and cannot be carried out satisfactorily. The suffering of our people after the war, such as widespread disasters, rising prices, local instability, lack of security in life, the inability of displaced people to return home, and the inability of those with jobs to enjoy their work, are even more serious in certain areas than during the war. It is truly what is called "like water, the deeper it gets; like fire, the hotter it gets." This is truly the most heartbreaking phenomenon. In order to save the people from suffering and ensure the fruits of victory, the government believes that restoration and construction require a peaceful and stable environment and the concerted efforts of the whole country. Therefore, on the one hand, in the case of manpower and talent being extremely difficult, we will do our best to remove all obstacles and promote the restoration work. On the other hand, we especially have to compromise and tolerate and use political methods to achieve national peace and unity, to make the different opinions of all parties converge, and to eliminate man-made difficulties and obstacles. Because we have seen the depth of suffering, the weight of sacrifice, and the danger of the situation during the war of resistance, and the difficulty of building the country after the war, the government deeply feels that it should start all construction in the shortest possible time with the spirit of "sword and shoes" to make China a modern country of peace, unity, democracy, prosperity, and strength. Only in this way can we stand in the ranks of the international community. The government's painstaking efforts to be responsible for the entire country and the entire nation should be deeply understood and sincerely maintained by all of you present today.

Based on the above objectives, the government has devoted itself to the work of peace and unity since the end of the war of resistance, especially focusing on the work of uniting the will and concentrating the strength, so that all parties, factions, and social elites have the opportunity to participate in national politics. At the same time, we must ensure that the convening of the National Assembly proceeds smoothly. In January of this year, the government convened the Political Consultative Conference, and we had sincere discussions on five major issues: government organization, the program for peaceful national construction, the military reorganization plan, the draft constitution, and matters related to the convening of the National Assembly, in order to open the way for peaceful national construction. The promulgation of the order to cease military conflicts and restore transportation, the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, and the formulation of the basic plan for military reorganization and the unification of the Communist army into the National army by the military three-person team are all proceeding along this goal. Although the current situation still has many difficulties for the goal of national peace and unity, if China wants to survive independently in the world and maintain the fruits of the arduous war of resistance, I dare to say that the above policy is as important as the national policy of sustained war of resistance, and the whole country must be united, with the greatest patience and the greatest sincerity, to overcome all difficulties and promote its success.

Today, China's greatest demand and the most urgent need of the entire people is nothing more than the completion of post-war restoration and rehabilitation and the start of construction work. It has been seven months since the victory of the war of resistance. There must be no more obstacles or delays in the restoration, rehabilitation, and construction work. The suffering of the people and the disturbances in the locality must be quickly resolved. Therefore, the government's current focus is on (A) restoring national order, relieving the people's suffering, stabilizing the economy, and stabilizing people's livelihood, to start economic construction. (B) Striving to fully implement the order to cease military conflicts and restore transportation and to implement the basic plan for military reorganization agreed upon by the military three-person team, so that military orders and government orders can be unified, and the people of the whole country can have the opportunity to recuperate. (C) The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th and must be held as scheduled to achieve our long-cherished wish to implement constitutional government. As for international relations, we must implement the original intention of the war of resistance, strive for the integrity of national territory, sovereignty, and administration, sincerely fulfill the treaties we have signed with our allies, and uphold the Charter of the United Nations to promote international cooperation to consolidate world peace. All four of these are determined in response to the development of the domestic and international situation and based on the universal and consistent demands of the entire country. Before the implementation of constitutional government, your council is the highest public opinion organ in the country and the only organ that can best express the public opinion of the people. I hope that you will observe the current environment of the country and give consistent assistance to the above points.

I would also like to especially mention that the resident councilors have made the greatest contribution in the eight months since the last meeting of your council. After the end of the war, there have been many changes in the domestic and international situation, and the government's response to everything in the interim has been particularly heavy and arduous, but the close connection between the Political Council and the government has always been consistent, not only has there been no separation, but it has always assisted the government in correcting many shortcomings. During the recess of your council, the resident councilors objectively and sincerely reviewed the government's measures at any time and contributed valuable opinions. The government has also often submitted important matters in its administration to the resident councilors for reporting and listening to criticism. This spirit of close cooperation and sincere trust has laid a good foundation for our country's future implementation of constitutional government. Compared with the relationship between the parliament and the government in Western countries, it can be said that we are no longer ashamed and should continue to maintain and promote it.

Finally, I would like to earnestly offer a few concrete and frank opinions to you. Reviewing the suggestions of the past Political Councils, the government has earnestly implemented everything that can be adopted. This meeting is being held during the period when the war has ended and the restoration is not yet complete. There must be no few matters that need to be improved and restored in national construction and local order. The councilors have gathered in the temporary capital from all directions and have a clearer understanding of what they hear and see. The matters to be suggested must also be more ambitious. The government is prepared to accept good words to help the country through its difficulties and relieve the people's suffering. What the government hopes from your council is that all resolutions will be implemented in full. Therefore, I hope that this meeting will: (A) grasp the key points and make more active and concrete suggestions. (B) Pay attention to reality and contribute practical and feasible methods that will surely succeed. (C) The relief of local suffering can only be sought from national stability and development. The Political Council is a national public opinion organ. You are not only representing a region or an occupation, but are representing the people of the whole country. Therefore, all suggestions regarding the relief of local suffering and the improvement of local welfare must take into account the overall interests and actual situation of the country, weigh the pros and cons and urgency, and express your frank opinions and provide solutions. Regarding the above three matters, I would like to express this sincere expectation on behalf of the government, hoping that you will contribute your grand plans and point out the shortcomings, so that all departments of the government can understand the people's suffering, strive for improvement, and fulfill their responsibilities. I wish your council success and the health of all of you.

### US Credit Loan to China: Export-Import Bank Announces Approval of Five Items; Totaling Over 33 Million US Dollars

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Export-Import Bank announced today that its board of directors has tentatively approved five credit loans to China in principle, totaling 33,793,750 US dollars. The details of the loans are still under negotiation and are expected to be completed within a few weeks. China will be able to use the credit loans to purchase a small number of ships in the United States, subsidize power plants, and repair raw materials and tools for railways and coal mines. The loan allocation is as follows: (1) $4,243,750 for the purchase of ten coastal freighters from the Maritime Commission. (2) $2,600,000 for the purchase of sixteen coastal freighters formerly managed by the Army Transportation Department, of which eleven were privately owned by the Wartime Shipping Administration. (3) $650,000 for the purchase of tools for repairing railways. (4) $8,800,000 for the purchase of ten 5,000-kilowatt auxiliary power plants. (5) $1,500,000 for the purchase of tools for coal mining. The terms of the above loans vary. The Export-Import Bank also announced that the Bank of China has signed an agreement with the Bank, guaranteed by the Chinese government, to establish a $33 million credit loan to purchase US cotton for state-run and private yarn factories. This credit loan was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on January 17.

US Cotton Loan Also Established: Textile Industry's Raw Materials Secured

According to today's announcement, the loan term is generally the same as the Bank's cotton loans to European countries, with an interest rate of 2.5% and a repayment period of 24 months after the US cotton arrives in China. Because inland transportation in China takes longer, the loan is extended by nine months compared to loans to Europe. The Export-Import Bank further stated that the loan amount can purchase 275,000 to 300,000 bales of US cotton, which can supply approximately 500 million yards of Chinese cotton cloth. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] According to government news, after the US Export-Import Bank provided a large amount of credit loans and US cotton loans, the raw material problem of the Chinese textile industry can be easily solved. Because the Chinese textile industry, which is currently taking over the textile industries operated by the Japanese, urgently needs a large amount of American cotton suitable for weaving fine cloth. In the next five years, China will still need to rely on large imports of American cotton to improve the finished products of Chinese cloth weaving and meet the people's clothing needs. China has cotton fields with boundless hope in Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and other provinces, but most of them are now abandoned.

### Cantonese-French Consulate Hides War Criminal

[Our newspaper's Guangzhou 20th dispatch] A situation similar to the Shanghai's Baelding incident has occurred here. The former French Vichy government's consul in Guangdong, Simon, who has been listed as a war criminal, is now being hidden by the current French consul, who refuses to hand him over for interrogation. According to sources at the Office of the Commander-in-Chief, evidence of Simon's actions harming the Allied war effort was collected at the end of last year. At that time, the secretary of the French Consulate, Lao Ge, acting as the consul, was responsible for acknowledging and retaining the evidence and guaranteed to hand Simon over to us for interrogation at any time. Unexpectedly, on the 15th, the Office of the Commander-in-Chief, following proper diplomatic channels, sent personnel to the French Consulate in Shamian to request Simon's handover. However, the French Consul, Wei Yingzhang, repeatedly refused, claiming that Simon still possessed consular qualifications and was different from ordinary war criminals, acting on the orders of the French government, forbidding our interrogation. Our side believes that such a statement by the French Consul is unfriendly and considers that as this is an Allied consulate, it should not harbor a common war criminal of the Allied nations. Therefore, to prevent Simon from escaping, troops have been dispatched to protect the consulate.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] White House Press Secretary Ross announced today that President Truman will not be able to attend the opening of the United Nations Security Council in New York on the 25th due to busy official duties.

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] President Truman submitted to Congress yesterday a report by Secretary of State Bernays on the recent visit of the US delegation to London to attend the United Nations Conference. President Truman also attached a letter stating that the United States supports the United Nations Charter and the full implementation of the principles contained therein. The United States will seek to achieve this goal and will seek to improve it. Those who are negligent in this and cause obstacles are traitors to countries fighting for peace, security, and welfare. Bernays' report stated: "I believe that the difficulties encountered can be overcome with perseverance and foresight."

### Wu Tiecheng Discusses Impressions of the Plenary Session; Corrects the Communist Party's Misinterpretations of Resolutions

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, Day X] After the close of the Second Plenary Session, the reporter specifically visited Wu Tieshicheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, and asked the following questions:

Q: What are the Secretary-General's impressions of this plenary session?

A: This plenary session discussed the current issues of the country with unprecedented enthusiasm and thoroughness. The main spirit of the meeting has been embodied in various resolutions and briefly listed in the declaration. In short, it is to concentrate the nation's strength and complete the mission of peace and national construction.

Q: Today's Xinhua Daily published the Communist Party's spokesperson's remarks and Mr. Zhou Enlai's remarks, stating that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session shook the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. What is the Secretary-General's opinion?

A: I am very surprised by the content of these two remarks and do not know their purpose. The Political Consultative Conference was convened by the government, and the government is in the process of implementing its resolutions. The Second Plenary Session confirmed the report of the Political Consultative Conference and has also made clear resolutions. The government will not only implement the resolutions but also hopes that the Communist Party will abide by them. As for the constitutional issue, it is still in the deliberation stage. The opinions put forward by the Second Plenary Session are also being presented by government representatives to the Constitutional Draft Review Committee to solicit opinions from all parties. Our party believes that the constitution is the goal of the revolution and is related to the country's major plans and must be carefully considered. Furthermore, there was an understanding in the original Political Consultative Conference that if there were better opinions, they could be put forward for joint consultation.

Q: Mr. Zhou Yinlai believes that the members of the National Government should not be elected by the Central Executive Committee. What is the Secretary-General's opinion?

A: According to the laws of the period of political tutelage, the members of the National Government should be elected by the Central Executive Committee of our party. The resolution on the expansion of the government organization in the Political Consultative Conference clearly pointed out in the footnote that the National Government members are "nominated and elected by the Chairman of the National Government." At that time, the common understanding was that they would be elected by the Central Executive Committee of our party. Simply referring to the original text of the Political Consultative Conference resolution would make it clear. Mr. Zhou Enlai's remarks seem to be a deliberate misinterpretation, which is quite regrettable. I don't know how the words "nominated and elected" will be interpreted.

Q: Mr. Zhou Enlai believes that the change of the National Defense Supreme Committee to the Central Political Committee is a "supreme guidance agency for politics" that is to guide the "National Government." Is this statement true?

A: The powers of the National Defense Supreme Committee have been transferred to the National Government Committee. The Central Political Committee is entirely the highest agency for our party to guide party members in politics and does not guide the government. The Communist Party also has a Political Bureau. Mr. Zhou Enlai's remarks are clearly a distortion and deliberately misleading.

Q: Mr. Zhou Enlai also said that the Plenary Session did not mention the issue of human rights at all, and criticized that the National Assembly Organization Law has not been amended. What does the Secretary-General think?

A: There is no need to make a resolution again on matters that the government has decided to implement. The laws restricting the people's freedom during the war are being repealed and amended separately. The government is sending the National Assembly Organization Law to the Legislative Yuan for amendment in accordance with the law.

Q: Mr. Zhou Enlai also said that the National Army did not comply with the ceasefire agreement and cited the words of Mr. Lin Zheng as evidence. Is this true?

A: Which side did not comply with the ceasefire agreement is a fact that the people of the whole country have seen and heard. The military mediation teams in various places also have reports. I hope the Communist Party will tell the truth and do practical things.

Q: Mr. Zhou Enlai said that the report of the Vice Minister of Military Affairs of the Plenary Session on the number of troops did not match the number reported in the Political Consultative Conference, and also said that his report on the troop demobilization plan violated the Political Consultative Conference resolution and the troop consolidation plan of the Military Three-Man Team. Does the Secretary-General think this is true?

A: The National Army currently has 4.9 million people (statistics for December last year). In addition to the 1.1 million people in various military agencies, schools, and the navy and air force, the army has a total of 3.8 million people. After the National Army stopped conscription, desertion and attrition are inevitable. Therefore, the estimated number of demobilizations cannot be calculated in full. The original report estimated that the attrition rate for the next twelve months would be at least 15%, which should be reduced by 570,000 people. The actual number of army personnel should be calculated based on 3.23 million people. When the first phase of the National Army's reorganization is completed, 1.8 million officers and soldiers will be retained, organized into 30 armies, 90 divisions, and special service units. The number of people who should be demobilized and transferred is 1.43 million (including 180,000 officers and 1.25 million soldiers), totaling 3.23 million people. Therefore, there is no error in the number of troops reported at the Political Consultative Conference as 3.8 million people and the total number of people reported at the Second Plenary Session as 4.9 million people, and the number of people transferred as listed in the outline of the troop demobilization plan as 1.43 million. The original outline also calculated the number of people to be transferred in the second phase as 650,000 people based on this principle. As for the troop demobilization plan of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the entire demobilization period is set at 18 months, the first phase is 12 months, demobilizing to 90 divisions, and the second phase is 6 months, demobilizing to 50 divisions. All of this strictly adheres to the troop consolidation plan of the Military Three-Man Team. As for the so-called "Engineering and Construction Corps," it is for officers and soldiers who cannot find jobs to engage in river management, road repair, afforestation, and land reclamation. According to Article 5 of Section 4 of the Political Consultative Conference's Peace and National Construction Program, "The government should plan for the re-employment and employment of demobilized and retired officers and soldiers." Engineering and construction are one of these plans and should never be misunderstood as an independent armed force. Mr. Zhou Enlai's misinterpretation does not need to be deeply refuted and is obvious.

Q: If, as the Secretary-General said, the Second Plenary Session had no intention of shaking the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference at all, why did the Communist Party suddenly launch such a large-scale propaganda offensive?

A: The best thing to do about this matter is to ask the Communist Party spokesperson and Mr. Zhou Enlai. What I can tell you is that every large-scale propaganda offensive by the Communist Party is immediately followed by a new action. It is unpredictable what new action will occur after today's Communist Party propaganda offensive. Try to pay attention to the development of the Northeast issue and the implementation of the unified compilation plan, or you may be able to observe its movements.

### Java War Resumes; Indonesian-Dutch Negotiations Suspended

[Our newspaper's report] London, 20th Broadcast: The Dutch-Indian and Indonesian negotiations, originally scheduled to be held today, were suddenly suspended. Fierce artillery battles broke out between British-Dutch troops and Indonesian troops in the Sembirong area on the north coast of Java. South of Batavia, Indonesian troops also attacked Indian troops. Indonesian troops in the Surabaya area attacked British troops with tanks and artillery.

[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Indonesian Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior jointly issued a notice yesterday stating that strict measures will be taken against groups of people who "incite propaganda or armed forces" that hinder the development of the Republic of Indonesia.

### India Striving for Freedom; Opportunity Ripe; Vigorously Developing, Impossible to Control; Nehru Hopes Britain Will Abandon Rule

[Reuters, Singapore, 20th] Nehru hosted reporters here at midnight and gave a speech that lasted two hours. When asked by reporters whether India was willing to accept dominion status, Mr. Nehru said that India's first step was to obtain complete freedom, such as the freedom to choose friends and comrades. Only after complete freedom is obtained can it be decided whether to remain within the British Commonwealth. Mr. Nehru also said that the Indian people completely sympathize with the people of Indonesia, so the presence of Indian troops in Indonesia makes the Indian people feel indignant. When asked by reporters whether he was optimistic about the British Cabinet Mission's trip to India, he replied that he felt that there was a strong force today that was forcing Britain to recognize India's freedom. Smart people all know that holding on to India is gradually losing its benefits and is becoming a burden. Since freedom has come, far-sighted people all want to make it a reality in the most appropriate way and should not prevent it to prevent a backlash. All of this can predict that the next negotiation will produce satisfactory results. However, there are still many British people today who regard themselves as landlords in India. The administrative authorities only know how to collect money and maintain law and order and never pay attention to the progress of the world and the causes of famine. The British government's plan is based on the reports of these administrative authorities. Many people have completely lost faith in the British government and do not believe that this mission can have any results. The people's antipathy has reached an uncontrollable point. The occurrence of famine is also due to improper handling by the authorities. Therefore, the Congress Party is determined not to accept British rule, but we are still willing to conclude agreements with Britain on certain events related to British interests. As for the Indians in Malaya, I can only reiterate the opinions I have previously put forward to Indians in Burma, Ceylon, and other places. Indians in these countries should choose according to law whether they are willing to be nationals of that country or Indian nationals. Mr. Nehru also said that the countries in the Indian Ocean region will gradually form closer relations, including Australia, and India will be its center.

Editorial

### Reaffirmation of an Enlightened Ethnic Policy

At the 19th session of the Second Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang, an important resolution was passed, stating: "It is hereby noted that our Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members of our great Chinese nation, and the regions where they are distributed are an inseparable part of our territory. Our Party has always aimed to support and develop all border compatriots, working hand in hand to achieve prosperity, strength, and happiness. ... Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the responsibility of nation-building should be jointly borne by all our compatriots. In accordance with this purpose, this Congress has carefully reviewed and resolved relevant cases, and based on the spirit of each case and the main points of reports and reviews, decides on the following points, aiming for their swift implementation to achieve the unity and unification of all ethnic groups within the country and lay the foundation for the long-term stability and security of the nation: (1) Under the principle of forming a unified democratic nation based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, the Constitution must clearly stipulate and guarantee the autonomous rights of border ethnic groups; (2) The reorganized members of the National Government Committee and the administrative members of the Executive Yuan must include loyal and capable comrades from the Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups; (3) Talented individuals from the Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups must have ample opportunities to participate in the actual work of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions; (4) Appropriately increase the number of representatives from the Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups in the newly added quota of National Assembly representatives, to be selected by the central government; (5) Reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission into the Ministry of Border Affairs, allowing capable individuals from the Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups to participate in actual work and assume actual responsibility; (6) In education at all levels in areas where border ethnic groups reside, emphasis should be placed on the native languages, with Mandarin as a compulsory subject, to be implemented by the Ministry of Education as appropriate. Official documents of all levels of government should be written in both Mandarin and the native language as a principle; (7) The central government must make reasonable regulations for the autonomous systems in various border areas, based on the actual situation of each area: (A) Regarding the Inner Mongolia region, restore the original Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee and clearly delineate the powers between the League and Banner governments and the provinces and counties; (B) Regarding the Xinjiang region, it should be implemented in accordance with the methods determined for resolving the Xinjiang Provincial Incident; (C) Regarding the Tibetan population under provincial jurisdiction, they should be given real opportunities to participate in provincial and county politics; (8) Special funds should be allocated for various undertakings such as economy, transportation, education, health, and relief in various border areas, and the relevant responsible agencies should be tasked with formulating and implementing plans to promote them promptly; (9) National defense troops stationed in various areas where border ethnic groups reside should be concentrated in several key areas, with rations supplied by the central government, without interfering in local administration. All local security teams should be staffed and trained primarily with members of the local ethnic groups and local people."

The above resolution is of considerable importance, especially today, when various ethnic minorities are often incited to carry out so-called "autonomous" movements. There are no so-called "ethnic minorities" in China like those appearing elsewhere, as our authorities have repeatedly clarified. This Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is a concise reaffirmation of the firm policy held by our Standing Committee. It states clearly from the outset: "It is hereby noted that our Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members of our great Chinese nation." This shows that Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all constituent members of our great Chinese nation, and not "ethnic minorities" outside of our great Chinese nation. This is the core of our entire ethnic policy. Our great Chinese nation is like a large family, and Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members of this family. All constituent members are as close as brothers and sisters and have the responsibility to maintain this large family.

However, each constituent member, due to historical and geographical factors, often forms its own unique lifestyle and cultural characteristics. If we want to forcibly abandon their inherent culture and lifestyle and force them to conform, from a historical point of view, not only will it fail to achieve practical results, but it will also easily lead to backlash. Moreover, it would be contrary to the peaceful and impartial ideals of the Three Principles of the People, the highest guiding principle of our nation-building. The resolution of this Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, in addition to expanding opportunities for border compatriots to participate in the central government, focuses on supporting the autonomy of border compatriots and maintaining their inherent culture and lifestyle. This not only demonstrates the central government's concern for border compatriots but also opens up a broad path for their future development. "In education at all levels in areas where border ethnic groups reside, emphasis should be placed on the native languages... The central government must make reasonable regulations for the autonomous systems in various border areas, based on the actual situation of each area." All that has been said above demonstrates how our central government, while adhering to unity, maintains their original lifestyle and cultural characteristics. This is truly a very wise decision. Because of this resolution, our country's ethnic policy becomes even more clear and should be admired by the world. The negative significance of this policy is that we abandon the assimilation policy with aggressive implications; on the positive side, our ethnic policy is to support the self-development of border compatriots and pay attention to the development of their inherent culture. Today, when centrifugal and divisive movements of "ethnic minorities" are taking place all over the world, it is very timely for us to reaffirm our enlightened ethnic policy at this moment.

Here, we must add that although our ethnic policy mainly targets Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots, we also regard the various "minority groups" scattered in the southwest and the aboriginal tribes living in Taiwan as members of our great Chinese nation, like brothers and sisters, even though their cultural standards may not be high. How to improve their living standards and enhance their welfare? Now that the central government has decided to establish a Ministry of Border Affairs, it is deeply believed that in the future, with a dedicated agency in charge, things will surely be properly carried out. All constituent members of our great Chinese nation shared weal and woe during the war. Now that the country has embarked on the road to nation-building, it must work hand in hand to achieve prosperity, strength, and happiness. Looking ahead, there are indeed great expectations.

### Eating Grass Roots and Tree Bark to Quench Hunger; China Urgently Awaits Funds; Our Representative Jiang Tingfu Makes a Special Appeal

[United Press, Atlantic City, 19th] Jiang Tingfu, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), arrived here to take up the chairmanship of the meeting and declared at the meeting that famine has occurred in China. Before he left the country, letters and telegrams reporting famine had poured in from all over the country. We originally said that famine was unavoidable, but now famine has already begun in China. There are many places where people eat tree bark and grass roots to barely survive, especially in Hunan Province, which is known as a rice-producing area, but is now known for famine. We originally thought that Taiwan could have surplus grain to help other provinces, but now not only has this become a pipe dream, but we also need to transport rice to provide relief.

[United Press International, Atlantic City, 20th] Jiang Tingfu declared at the meeting that Siam has 2.5 million tons of rice in storage, but due to political reasons, it cannot be shipped out. Jiang also said that the lack of rice in the Far East could cause millions of people to die.

[United Press, Atlantic City, 19th] UNRRA Director-General Lehman announced today that the agency has accepted France's invitation to hold its next plenary session in Paris.

### US Expresses Disagreement with French Proposal

### Horrifying! Two Million People Killed in Two and a Half Years; Nazi Concentration Camp Director Admits to Using Gas Chambers for Massacres

[United Press, Hamburg, Germany, 19th] The British military authority in Hamburg announced tonight that the former director of the Auschwitz concentration camp, Hoess, has signed a confession of a shocking historical massacre case, admitting that from June 1941 to the end of 1943, he gassed two million people to death, all personally arranged by him. Hoess was a lieutenant colonel in the German Nazi stormtroopers. After a major search by the British military authorities in the occupied area, he was arrested in Flensburg ten days ago. His assistant, "the Beast of Belsen" Kramer, was hanged in April. Hoess's confession includes a conversation with the former leader of the German secret police, Himmler. He discussed with Himmler the construction of five large gas chambers and a crematorium. Himmler told Hoess: "These people must be gassed to death, otherwise, in case Germany loses the war, 'the Germans will be wiped out by them.'" When Hoess was questioned, he was asked if he believed in God. He replied: "No, absolutely not!"

### The Gold Dollar Kingdom of Today! Lacking in Material Goods, But Abundant in Idle Funds; Two Hundred Times More Than Six Years Ago

[United Press, New York, 19th] In 1946, the United States did not feel a lack of anything except for money, so idle funds flooded, and the low interest rates on loans were unprecedented in history. Billions of dollars of idle funds cannot find a way out, causing interest rates to decrease. Very little of this idle money is used to purchase consumer goods because the stock of goods is not abundant and supply cannot meet demand. Theaters, nightclubs, and entertainment venues are overcrowded, retailers' businesses are booming, and more and more people are searching for various goods and making other investments, which is proof that idle funds are abundant. In addition, there are also many buyers of stocks and bonds, making various securities difficult to find. As a result of the abundance of idle funds, the economic departments in the United States are in increasingly difficult situations. Financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and trust companies are fiercely opposed to the low-interest rate policy held by the Ministry of Finance, but some companies welcome this policy because they can take the opportunity to issue bonds or pay off old debts at low interest rates. The government also welcomes this policy because it needs to pay interest on the huge amount of public debt it has issued. The total amount of US public debt is 300 billion US dollars, and the annual interest payment is about 2%, which is 6 billion US dollars. If the interest rate is raised to 4%, the annual interest payment will reach 120 million, which is equal to the total amount of public debt issued by the United States in 1918.

It is estimated that the current idle funds in the United States are 200 times more than in 1939. The total amount of cash and negotiable securities is 250 billion US dollars, about four times the amount in 1929. Bond prices continue to rise, and bondholders receive very little interest.

### Higher Court Prosecutor's Office: 110 Traitor Cases Handled and Prosecuted; Approximately 400 More Cases to be Sent for Investigation; War Criminals Tried by Three Courts Based on the Nature of Their Crimes

[Reported by This Newspaper] Chief Prosecutor Du Bao of the Municipal High Court recently told reporters that as of now, the office has handled more than 170 traitor cases, of which approximately 110 have been prosecuted. Most of these traitors were sent by the police bureau and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. There are approximately 400 more cases that will soon be transferred to the court by relevant agencies. Currently, all foreigners residing in China from any country in the world must abide by Chinese law because consular jurisdiction no longer exists. Among the criminals investigated by the High Prosecutor's Office, a considerable number are foreigners, one of whom was even the Finnish Consul-General in Shanghai. As for war criminals, Chief Prosecutor Du stated that those whose crimes are only related to China are handled by the recently established military court; if they are only related to the United States, they are handled by the US military court specially authorized by the Chinese government (located in Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison); if their crimes involve more than one country, they are handled by the International Military Tribunal, such as the Tokyo Far East International Military Tribunal.

Military Court Begins Investigation

The Shanghai Military Court held its first investigative hearing for war crime suspects yesterday afternoon at 3 PM after its establishment. A total of four Japanese war criminals were questioned and investigated yesterday afternoon, all of whom were submitted to the court by the Army Headquarters for trial. The names of the four criminals will be kept confidential in accordance with regulations during the investigation period. However, it is understood that all four criminals were arrested among prisoners of war and did not include any former military police officers. As soon as the investigation is completed, a public prosecution will be filed and a public trial will be held. Furthermore, the military court on the fourth floor of the Shanghai Command Post of the headquarters has been prepared under the command of Director Xu Zhenqiu of the military law department and Section Chief Zhang Disheng, and it is expected that the date of the public trial will not be far off.

US Military Continues Trial of Four Japanese War Criminals

Former Commander of the Japanese 13th Army, Sawada Shigeru, and Japanese soldiers Wakou Yuuki, Okada Ryuhei, and Tateta Gaisuke, continued to be tried by the US military court yesterday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs presented a total of 51 pages of evidence, all of which were the testimonies of American pilots obtained by the American War Crimes Tribunal in the United States. In the afternoon, a certain Japanese teacher was also called to testify. He worked in the Japanese military department when the Doolittle pilots were sent to Shanghai in April 1942 and reported on the situation at that time. The case may be retried for another week, and the verdict will be announced next week.

Gao Jinsheng and Others Sentenced

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Criminal Court of the High Court in Tilanqiao held a collegial panel yesterday afternoon at 2 PM and sentenced four cases of colluding with the enemy and serving in relevant military organs: (1) Gao Jinsheng, who was a secret agent for the enemy military police in Yangsiqiao, was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights; (2) Gu Youmou, who was an enemy cook, proficient in Japanese, and translator for the Jiangnan Shipyard, recruited 270 workers for the enemy, was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights; (3) Zhu Bingrong, a coppersmith, who served as an intelligence officer for the enemy navy in Shishanlukou, was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent deprivation of civil rights; (4) Chuan Guangyao, who opened the Longchang copper and tin shop and collected copper coins to aid the enemy, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. In the above four cases, the property of the defendants, after deducting the necessary living expenses for their families, was confiscated.

Zou Zhigao and Others Await Judgment

[Another Dispatch] Three cases, in which the defendants were charged with serving as low- and mid-level officials in enemy puppet organizations during the enemy occupation, or were accused of dealing with the enemy due to business relations, were concluded yesterday. They include (1) Zou Zhigao, a native of Shanghai, who served as a recommended technician in the General Affairs Section of the Puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration from 1941 to 1945. The prosecutor indicted him based on his admitted facts, but his daughter, Zou De, provided various facts to refute the charges. The lawyer also argued that he had not harmed the country. (2) Zhang Qipin, a native of Ningbo, 35 years old, was the manager of the Fuxing Nail Factory and was accused of manufacturing nails for the Jiangnan Shipyard of the enemy navy. However, he claimed that he was coerced and monitored by the enemy military police, so he started working. (3) Zou Xiangding, a native of Nanjing, 40 years old, opened a watch shop and was accused of being a detective for the puppet police station. However, several neighbors testified that he had no dealings with the enemy puppet authorities. His lawyer argued that at that time, due to business relations, he may have had a conflict with the personnel of the puppet police station, and among the police stations after the restoration, there are still some former elements, and Zou was handed over to the court by the police station, which is full of injustice. After the debate, all three cases were scheduled to be sentenced on the 27th.

### Childish Ignorance of Danger Leads to Explosion While Playing with a Bomb; Tragic Incident at Hualong Elementary School; Blood Splatters in the Classroom; Nine Students Killed or Injured

[Reported by This Newspaper] The sixth classroom on the third floor of Hualong Elementary School at 62 Hualong Road is the sixth grade classroom. There are more than fifty students in the whole grade. One of the students, Liu Liyin (14 years old), found a hand grenade shaped like an iron ball in an alley when he arrived at school at around 8 AM yesterday. He became curious and took it to the classroom to show it to his classmates. Those who saw it were young and did not know what it was, and they played with it together. Unexpectedly, they accidentally touched the mechanism, and it suddenly exploded. With a loud noise, iron fragments flew everywhere, causing a major disaster.

Teachers and Students Shocked, Order Disrupted

Male student Liu Liyin (who found the hand grenade) and female student Cui Renqin (14 years old), who died from severe injuries to their back and waist, were killed on the spot in the classroom. The injured were Zhang Bingchun (male), Liang Guangzu (male), Jin Guangxi (female), Chen Haijun (male), Niu Mingfang (female), Wu Mingqiang (male), and Wang Bingquan (male). All of them were injured in their hands, feet, head, and face. Blood splattered everywhere, and the entire school's teachers and students were shocked and at a loss, and order was disrupted. After the incident, the Lujiawan Police Precinct reported it and immediately ordered the police to investigate.

Police Investigate, Families Visit

The police once summoned Principal Qu Yudong and sixth grade teacher Chen Zihao to the bureau for questioning. The injured students were taken by ambulances to Guangci and Nanyang Hospitals for treatment. The bodies of the two students were sent to Tongren Fuyuantang. When the explosion occurred, there was a huge noise. The families of the students nearby heard the alarm and rushed to the school to see their children. Seeing this tragic scene, they all cried loudly. It was reported that Liang Guangzu, one of the injured students, was transferred to the Red Cross Hospital by his family due to his serious injuries.

### The Desolate Film Industry: Talent and Finances in Crisis; Directors Unwilling to Work; Fei Mu Considers Writing a Script

[Our Newspaper Report] The various studios of the Chinese Film Company in Shanghai, which operated during the enemy occupation period, have been taken over by the Central Government. The former Lihua Film Studio No. 2 is now Central Film Studio No. 1, and the Tian Tong Road studio in Zhabei is now Studio No. 2. The former Lihua Film Studio No. 3 on Avenue Joffre has been taken over by the China Film Studio of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission and renamed Studio No. 1, while the studio on Connaught Road is now Studio No. 2.

Yesterday afternoon, our reporter visited the famous film director Fei Mu to inquire about his plans for the post-war development of the film industry. According to Fei, the mission of the film industry is of great importance, and film has a significant impact on society and the public, so it must not be treated lightly. Although the Central Government is currently encouraging the revival of the film industry, most filmmakers and producers, directors, and screenwriters are hesitant to start because of a lack of suitable subjects and talent, as well as shortages in funding, equipment, and studio space. There is also a severe shortage of directors and screenwriters. The general public only knows the actors and actresses and does not pay attention to the directors, but the success or failure of a film depends entirely on the director. The low status of directors means that no one will be willing to take on this work.

Regarding the handling of people who worked in the film industry during the enemy occupation, the film industry is currently conducting tests, investigations, and evaluations, and anyone who was actually responsible for enemy-controlled film production will be disqualified.

During the occupation of Shanghai, Fei Mu left the film industry to work in directing plays, and later retired after being threatened by the Japanese, and has remained retired for over a year. Fei has recently been living in seclusion, planning to write a film script. However, according to Fei himself, finding a suitable subject has been quite difficult. Fei is a humble man and says that he needs to study and learn more, and does not want to mention his past work, as he feels he has achieved nothing. Fei is working hard on this script and hopes to have a work to contribute to the public before the summer or fall of this year.

The Central Film Studio will soon begin shooting "The Family of Loyalty and Righteousness," with Qin Yi possibly playing the female lead, and Liu Qiong or Zhao Dan as the male lead.

### Feet/Limp/Eye/Blind/Traveling/Rear/Shouting: Wang Changxi, the "Holy Wounded Warrior," Arrives in Shanghai, Loudly Calling to Awaken the National Soul

Wang Changxi, the honored veteran known as the "Holy Wounded Warrior" (pictured), arrived in Shanghai from Xi'an at 9 AM yesterday and is temporarily residing at the YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao. Wang is a native of Tangyi, Shandong, who joined the military at a young age and served as a soldier, participating in the battles of Xifengkou, Lugouqiao, and Taierzhuang, among others. He was wounded multiple times, and after recovering, he returned to the front lines. During the Battle of Taierzhuang, he was blinded by tear gas and had both legs disabled by explosives. However, Wang once said: "The enemy can cripple my eyes, but not my mouth; disable my feet, but not my heart." Despite his blindness and lameness, he traveled behind enemy lines, shouting loudly to awaken the national soul. He traveled through the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Henan. Everywhere he went, he gave inspirational speeches to schools, government agencies, and organizations, which were welcomed and supported by people from all walks of life. Over the past six or seven years, the慰勞金 (financial support) he received for his inspirational work has reached 46 million yuan. Part of this he donated to the nation, and with another part, he founded Changxi Charity Schools in Hengyang, Hunan; Quanzhou, Guangxi; and Baoji, Shaanxi, to accommodate the children of honored veterans and impoverished children. It is said that Wang's visit to Shanghai will include spiritual speeches to the public at major schools, entertainment venues, and factories, as well as an exhibition of his personal achievements in resisting Japan over the past seven years, which are the crystallization of his efforts.

### 20 Million Yuan Robbery Case Solved in a Shed in Hongzhen

Five Suspects Arrested, Stolen Goods Recovered

[Our Newspaper Report] The De Kang Paint Factory at No. 113 Dongjiazhai Road in the suburbs of Shanghai was formerly established by the enemy and was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs after the victory. At 0:30 AM on the 11th of last month, a large number of bandits suddenly tied up the employees stationed at the factory and loaded about 30 barrels of large and small sulfide metals, worth over 20 million yuan, onto a truck and fled. On the 23rd, Zhang Kechang, a plainclothes police sergeant from the Second Unit of the Tilanqiao Sub-bureau, discovered that several suspects related to the case were hiding in a shed at No. 27 Miaohou Road in Hongzhen.

### Admiral Kirk Returns from Inspecting U.S. Military Missions

[Our Newspaper Report] Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, returned to Shanghai after inspecting the U.S. Navy situation in Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Tanggu, Tianjin, and Beiping. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, he hosted a reception for local reporters on the fifth floor of the Cathay Hotel.

Visited MacArthur in Tokyo

Admiral Kirk stated that the main task of his trip to North China was to inspect the situation of the U.S. Navy in various North China ports, such as transporting Chinese troops, repatriating Japanese troops, training the Chinese Navy in Qingdao, supplying the Marine Corps in various areas, and the situation of the U.S. Army in Korea. He not only urged these matters, but also ensured that they complied with the U.S. demobilization plan. Admiral Kirk also visited Marshal Special Envoy and General MacArthur in Tokyo and inspected the port of Pusan in southeastern Korea.

Trained Naval Personnel to Return to China

To date, the U.S. Navy has transported seven Chinese armies, totaling 220,000 personnel, to North China, and 800 Chinese naval personnel are being trained in Qingdao. 1,100 Chinese naval personnel being trained in the U.S. will return to China in early April, sailing eight or ten warships gifted to China under the Lend-Lease Act. The number of U.S. Navy personnel and ships in China is gradually decreasing. However, this has no major impact on their work. Due to the decrease in personnel and ships, the number of Japanese and Korean civilians and military personnel being repatriated, and the transportation of food and Chinese military equipment, is not large.

Fewer Incidents with Sailors Expected

After the U.S. Seventh Fleet completes its mission in China, it will continue to defend various ports in the western Pacific, while the Fifth Fleet will defend the eastern Pacific. Admiral Kirk stated that the behavior of U.S. sailors has improved greatly in the past two months, but some are new personnel with slightly poorer discipline, and having been at sea for a long time, they are prone to transgressions once on land. Thanks to the close cooperation of the Chinese authorities and the U.S. military police, it is expected that there will be fewer incidents in the future.

### Mastermind of the Shooting of a Policeman Arrested

Wu Qilin, a police officer from the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau, was suddenly attacked by thugs and shot three times while on duty at Hongqiao Garden on Hongqiao Road at 4 PM on January 31. The case had not yet been solved. Chief Chen ordered Chen Kaizhou, the chief of the judicial section, to lead Inspector Ma Yiqiu and others to investigate. On the previous day, plainclothes police officers Shen Fuxing and Yuan Genbao arrested the mastermind of the case, Cao Jindi, a local resident, and Wu Tongsheng and Ye Miaosheng, in the Tangzijing area. They also confiscated two pistols and seven bullets. Other accomplices are still at large and are currently being pursued.

### Dispute Arises from the U.S. Army Transportation Department Firing Drivers

Shen Yifang, a driver for the U.S. Army Transportation Department at No. 100 Meyers Road, was suddenly fired the day before yesterday. When the remaining workers inquired with the authorities about the reason, the employer refused to answer. The workers requested that Shen Yifang be retained, but this was rejected, and all of the drivers' licenses were taken away, forcing over 1,200 drivers to stop working. Yesterday morning, worker representatives and representatives from the drivers' union petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, which dispatched personnel at 11 AM to negotiate, but they were also refused. It is reported that the workers will form a Forced Work Stoppage Committee to appeal to all sectors of society.

### Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Explains the Labor Movement Issues; Press Conference Hosted by the Municipal Government News Liaison Group

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the Municipal Government News Liaison Group, formerly known as the News Release Group of the Municipal Government, held its first press conference in the Municipal Government Auditorium, with Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, in attendance to report on and explain the labor movement issues. He stated that the frequent labor movements in various industries in recent months are mainly due to economic factors. According to statistics from the Social Affairs Bureau, the more volatile the prices, the more labor movements occur. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau is now working hard to encourage various industries to adopt cost-of-living-based salary systems to stabilize the lives of employees and protect them from the impact of price fluctuations. Industries such as public utilities, cotton mills, flour mills, and department stores have already implemented cost-of-living indices with great success. In addition, the factory conference system in the Factory Law is being promoted, with representatives from both labor and management forming a committee to resolve all labor welfare, salary increase disputes, etc., to promote labor-management cooperation. Director Wu expressed his determination to achieve equal pay for equal work to ensure fairness and avoid labor disputes. Regarding the astonishingly high wages of Western-style tailors and the arbitrary increase in prices by the barbers' association to more than 10,000 times the level of 1937, Director Wu promised to intervene. Finally, Zhu Xubai of the News Liaison Group announced that a press conference would be held again at 3 PM today in the Municipal Government Auditorium.

### On-the-Spot Report from Haimen Reader: Riverbank Collapse Presents Perilous Situation

— Huang Zongwen

Appeals to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or Water Conservancy Association to Send Personnel for Survey

Haimen in northern Jiangsu, located between Nantong and Qidong, is bordered by the Yangtze River to the south, with waves reaching the sky, truly a coastal life. Unfortunately, in recent years, the river tides have been abnormal, and the water flow is rapid, like a landslide or tsunami. Along the river, farmland is collapsing into the water. Good land and beautiful scenery are gradually being eroded by the river tide, gradually turning into nothing. Locals call it "sea collapse." People say, "Sea collapse takes everything, fire burns half," which shows the depth of the disaster. The author is a native of Haimen and one of the victims, forced to come to Shanghai to make a living. Recently, returning home to visit relatives, I was able to mourn and survey the situation. The riverbanks are steep, and the water is over ten feet deep. The land on the bank has deep and wide cracks, with the immediate danger of collapsing. I hardly dared to approach. The vast farmland along the river is desolate and cannot be planted because before the seedlings mature, the land will belong to the Dragon King of the Sea. Now, the victims are everywhere, displaced, some committing suicide, some becoming beggars, and even some taking risks. The misery is indescribable. I am requesting that your newspaper disclose this situation and urge the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or the Water Conservancy Association to send personnel to investigate the disaster situation along the river in Haimen as soon as possible and find ways to build dikes and prevent disasters, which would be as benevolent as a rebirth for the millions of living beings there.

The husband has been gone for six years without news, and she is extremely anxious. Life is also difficult to continue! Victory in the War of Resistance, the sky is bright again.

### Gold Notes Show Little Fluctuation; Hong Kong Exchange Recovering in the Afternoon; Textile Factory Jardine Matheson Buys

Yesterday's market was sluggish. Before noon, only 20,000 trades started. The Bank of China was still allocating at a price of 1.6 million, so the traders felt it difficult to accept this price, which was slightly higher than the black market. Therefore, although the total number of registered trades was 200, the actual number of transactions was probably small. During the session, the selling price was 1.6 million, and after the opening, the situation was sluggish. It was difficult to buy in at a price of 1.58 million. During the Bank of China's allocation, the price was around 1.59 million. Therefore, although traders registered, some traders did not accept. After that, the market was as dead as a bear until noon, when it was still around 1.59 million. In the afternoon, it struggled for a long time around 1.58 million, but finally, with looser money supply and more buyers taking advantage of the low prices, it only fell by 10,000. The listed price for gold ornaments was still 173,000 yuan, silver 1,600 yuan, and silver dollars rose to around 950 yuan. The discount was more balanced than yesterday, with interest rates of about 18% to 21%.

There was no change in foreign currency. U.S. dollars opened at 2,000 yuan with sellers, then fell 10 yuan after opening. Trading was limited. In the afternoon, it continued to fall, hovering around 1,980 yuan, and fell 15 yuan compared to the previous close. The U.S. exchange rate was still flat. Old Manchukuo notes continued to prosper, and major players were competing to buy new notes. There was a sudden surge in price. Notes from 1937 rose to 155 yuan, and those from 1938 rose to 153 yuan, then hovered slightly. However, the market rebounded again in the afternoon. It was rumored that a certain textile factory and Jardine Matheson had bought a lot. As a result, old notes were good for 5 yuan, and new notes surged 35 yuan. Hong Kong Electric was 455 yuan and Rubicon was 555 yuan.

### Stocks in a Rising Tide

Although public bonds were slightly stable, major players did not come in with rumors of investment, so the market temporarily remained quiet. Type C bonds opened at 1,750 yuan, with a high price of 1,780 yuan before falling more than 100 yuan. The process was mediocre and extremely boring. Until noon, it was still hovering below 1,650 yuan, and the result was similar to the previous close. Types A, B, D, and E bonds rebounded slightly. After the bulk transfer of Chinese stock chips the previous day, the market was even more exhausted yesterday. Operators were short of goods, and as soon as there were buyers, the price immediately increased. As for various speculations, bullish or bearish, they were all in the stream of nervous people. There was strong buying yesterday, and all the gloom was dispelled. Idle funds were active, and banks had more new money on hand and insisted on not releasing it. There were more monks than porridge. Yongxing Yarn rose from 3,900 yuan, Meiya at 2,950 yuan, Jingfu at 2,350 yuan, Xinguang at 2,200 yuan, and Qinxing at 1,650 yuan, gradually shifting from fatigue to stability. Around noon, the search for idle funds became even more urgent, and the surge was even greater. The midday close ended at high prices. As a result, the closing prices had continued to increase by 15% to 20%. Great China Match was a leader in manufacturing stocks, and the bottom price was extremely cheap. With the help of banks, it suddenly jumped by about 30% yesterday. In the afternoon, transactions to settle the next day were higher with Yongxing Yarn at 4,500 yuan, Meiya at 3,600 yuan, Jingfu at 2,750 yuan, Xinguang at 2,500 yuan, and Qinxing at 2,000 yuan. After these major players gained their desired amount, they released it, all selling at high prices. The peak was difficult to sustain, and it eventually fell by half. Foreign stocks jumped by 10% as soon as they opened. Chinese stocks were quickly followed by active players. Although operators were mostly nervous, they all echoed the movement where there was profit. Except for Steel Asia, which slightly fell after increasing, almost all ended at high prices. As a result, prices had jumped 10% to 15% higher.

### Cotton Yarn Stops Falling and Starts to Rise; Textile Construction Continues to Open; Piece Goods Sales Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded and rose. The continuous spring rain suddenly cleared, and sales expanded as a result. Yarn prices stopped falling and started to rise. 20-count Double Horse yarn rebounded to 1.12 million, closing 100,000 higher than yesterday. Other counts of yarn also recovered by 30,000 to 50,000. It is said that a ship will go directly to Guangdong within the day, so Cantonese merchants are eagerly stocking up.

Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company continued to sell flannel, serge, silk, Hainsworth, blankets, etc., a total of 25 kinds, and added 7 kinds of cotton cloth. The selling prices were lower than the market price. Cotton yarn will be sold as usual today.

Yesterday, New York American cotton fluctuated up and down by three to five points. Near-term American cotton was 26.75, far-term was 26.61, and Middling spot was 2.30. Transactions of local cotton were reduced. Only Shenxin Yarn Factory purchased Zhangde cotton at 100,500, Sanyu Town cotton at 96,000, and Dafeng American upland cotton at 95,000. The above prices are factory prices. Textile Construction Company did not take any action. Zhoupu seed cotton was still priced at 17,000 yuan. The market price was slightly different from yesterday. Sales of cotton cloth were sluggish, because the price of American Memphis cotton in Sichuan was only 100,000 yuan, while the Shanghai price was 95,000 yuan. After deducting interest, wharfage, taxes, etc., there was no profit to be made, so it is feared that the cloth market will be difficult to revive in the short term.

### Notice to Importers

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Central Bank opened the foreign exchange market, it has also stipulated regulations for import and export trade, which are handled in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade." For imports, in addition to goods that are freely imported and prohibited from being imported, for goods that are permitted to be imported, an application must be made to the Customs for a permit before foreign exchange can be purchased. The Customs has established an Import Goods Management Office the day before yesterday, with Director of the Customs Administration, Zhang Fuyun, concurrently serving as Director. The reporter specifically visited Mr. Zhang yesterday. According to him, after the establishment of the office, it will handle applications for permits for five kinds of imported goods, namely: (1) kerosene, (2) sugar, cube sugar, and rock candy, (3) flue-cured tobacco, (4) passenger cars and their chassis (passenger cars refer to those with a factory price of less than US$1,200), and (5) censored films. The preliminary procedures have been handled since the day before yesterday until the 25th, first handling the registration of import firms. The office has printed a registration application form for filling out, which is divided into eight items, namely: (1) name of the import firm, (2) nationality, (3) address, (4) capital, (5) person in charge, (6) date of establishment of the import firm in China, (7) goods for which import permits are applied, (8) previous import quantity (state the country of import, the quantity and value of imports from 1932 to 1936 and after October 1945. If the import firm was established after 1932, the annual import quantity for the first five years after establishment should be reported). After the registration date expires, the applications will be reviewed, and the number of qualified import firms will be determined. The registration issue for newly organized import firms is still under consideration. The quantity of various permitted imports may be based on the average annual import quantity of our country before the war. He said that the matter of permitting imports has no precedent to follow, and everything is in the initial stage of trial operation. In the future, all parts of the country will be handled in a unified manner. He himself is eager to handle matters impartially to facilitate the business community. As for the taxation of permitted imports, it will be handled in accordance with the Customs Tariff promulgated in 1934. In addition, prohibited imports that have been ordered from abroad before March 1 of this year are uniformly limited to be imported before the end of March. Imports after the deadline will be prohibited. Other goods that are free to enter and for which permits can be applied are not subject to this restriction.

### British Control of Cotton Imports

The Lancashire trade community was shocked to learn of this news. It is estimated that at least 400 commercial firms will be prohibited from operating.

### Flannel is in Demand; Lack of Market Goods Makes Prices Expensive

Flannel has recently been in demand due to warmer weather. Tailors are increasing their purchases due to frequent sales. Gray is in particular demand. However, the market goods are very scarce. Mainland merchants have very little in stock, and consignment merchants are also not well-stocked. Therefore, the market price is very high, and most of the time there is a market but no goods.

### After a Long Rain, the Price of Rice Falls Back

Yesterday, the rice market, because the weather cleared, and the previous hundred or so rice boats detained in Huangdu were all released, the source was unblocked, the arrival of goods was enthusiastic, and people's hearts softened. The price of japonica and indica rice fell by 2,000 yuan or more. In particular, the early, thin rice from the southern merchants was the most sluggish. However, white yuan rice was scarce and still held firm. Transactions of flour were few, and the price was flat and tired. The oil market also rebounded by a small 1,000 yuan or so. Raw Shantou and Qingdao spot goods were sold, and the market situation was sluggish. The arrival of soybean oil was still small, and soybeans turned into a tired situation, falling by another 400 to 500 yuan. Soybean cake rebounded by a small 100 yuan or so. Wheat bran was flat. Mung beans and sesame seeds had little fluctuation. However, high-quality raw oil was very popular and continued to rise by more than 2,000 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Slightly Tight

The price of sugar has been loose for several days, but yesterday it rebounded slightly. For example, the price of medium sugar and white sugar once reached 49,000 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday it was over 49,500 yuan. Four-and-a-half white sugar was tighter due to the shortage of goods. The asking price was 85,000 to 86,000 yuan. Sales of labeled goods were few.

### White Lead Sheet; Shortage of Goods Drives up Prices

Imports of Belgian white lead sheets have been interrupted for as long as seven or eight years. Therefore, the existing inventory in this street is becoming more and more depleted, and the market price is rising steadily, exceeding the red price by three or five times, depending on the amount of demand. For example, the demand for No. 9 and No. 10 for printing houses is very large, so the price is also the highest, currently asking 4.3 million yuan per barrel. No. 8 is asking 3.2 million yuan per barrel. No. 2 thin colored sheets have a large number of sheets and are widely used, and are currently selling for 3 million yuan per barrel. The prices of No. 6 and No. 18 and No. 19 are similar, all around 2.2 million yuan. The former is used by battery factories, and the latter is used exclusively for zinc sheets. The usage of No. 12, No. 14, and No. 16 are less, so the selling price is the lowest, only 1.5 to 1.6 million per barrel.

### Sichuan Provincial College of Education to Become the Capital University; Sichuan Provincial Assembly Details Reasons and Makes Recommendations to the Government

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The Sichuan Provincial College of Education was recently recommended by the Sichuan Provincial Assembly to be changed to the Capital University. The reasons are as follows: (1) After the victory, the major secondary schools in Sichuan moved back. The College of Education should be expanded into the Capital University to facilitate the enrollment of Sichuan youth. (2) Sichuan has now been designated as a model province. In order to adapt to reality, a large number of construction talents should be cultivated. Changing it to the Capital University has this mission. (3) After returning to the capital, in order to promote the great achievements of Sichuan, a Capital University should be established and used as a memorial. (4) The college has substantial equipment and many faculty members, so it is easy to change it to the Capital University. The provincial government has decided to adopt this proposal, and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education has also stated that it is necessary to rebuild it, so filing the case will not be a problem.

### Student Unrest at Yingshi University Continues Intermittently

Resumption of Classes Possible Only Next Week

[Our Newspaper, Yongjia Special Report] After the overall victory, National Yingshi University moved from Taishun County in southern Zhejiang to Yongjia City to find a place to hold classes. Soon after, student unrest occurred. The student union called for the expulsion of Principal Du Zuozhou. After the school authorities reported the situation to the Ministry of Education for verification, they received an order from the Ministry to punish the students who caused the incident according to the circumstances. The school authorities then expelled five radical students, Zhang Botan, Zhu Shuping, Zhang Dali, Ye Shuzi, and Xiang Chu. The students then went on strike and paraded in the streets, shouting slogans, posting slogans, attacking the principal, and opposing the expulsion of classmates. According to people familiar with the matter, the student unrest at Yingshi University this time was caused by Principal Du's excessive emphasis on emotion. His appointment of a small number of faculty members was very unsatisfactory, and when the students suggested reforms to him, he was unable to deal with it thoroughly due to considerations of face, thus arousing public anger and causing student unrest, which was not due to any major inferior performance on his part. The school site has been determined to be Jinhua. The student unrest continues intermittently. After negotiations, the school has agreed to withdraw the expulsion of the students, and resumption of classes may be possible only next week.

### National Central Institute of Technology Strikes Again; 1,300 People Go to the Ministry to Petition

Will Cooperate with the Women's Normal School in Demands

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The National Central Institute of Technology was recently ordered by the Ministry to stay in Sichuan for operation. The teachers and students were disappointed to hear the news. The school once went on strike in mid-December last year over the issue of relocation. Later, Minister Zhu telegraphed Principal Wei Yuanguang and promised to move back to Nanjing before classes resumed. The Ministry of Education also ordered the school to prepare a rehabilitation plan. Now the Ministry has ordered it to stay in Sichuan, and all teachers and students believe that the disposition is inappropriate. After several discussions among the students, it was decided to go on strike for the second time, and together with the students from the Dongjiaxi branch of the school, a total of more than 1,300 people, went to the Ministry of Education to petition and made strong appeals to the relevant authorities. It happened that the National Women's Normal School was dissolved by the Ministry of Education due to the relocation turmoil, and the students organized a school protection group to come to Chongqing. Therefore, the two schools will cooperate and demand that the Ministry of Education give an explanation quickly.

### Such is Changsha! People Flow Like a Tide, Wandering and Unable to Find a Home

— Special Dispatch from Changsha, 9th of this month, Anonymous Contributor

Changsha, after four battles, seems to be gradually returning to prosperity on the surface, with bustling streets and people rubbing shoulders. People are flowing into Changsha like a tide, exacerbating the already serious "housing problem." The rise in food prices, due to the population concentration leading to a supply-demand imbalance, seems to be closely related. However, there are other important factors contributing to the soaring food prices. The eleven lakeside counties, known as the granary of Hunan, recently sent representatives to the provincial government requesting exemption from purchasing military grain, citing their meager reserves and inability to supply. This area, known for its abundant rice production, is now crying out about a grain shortage – isn't that surprising? Actually, it's not surprising at all.

Empty Rooms and No Green Grass in the Fields

From the Xiang-Gui campaign the year before last to the Xiang-Xi battle last summer, this province has suffered deeply from banditry. Moreover, last year, various counties experienced droughts, floods, windstorms, and insect plagues. People who fled and returned found themselves unable to survive. Even the Dongting Lake area, nicknamed "the granary," felt a sense of "empty rooms and no green grass in the fields." The situation in other barren mountainous areas is even more imaginable. The mandatory purchase of huge amounts of military grain further exacerbates the grain shortage. According to a clear order from the central government, this province's field tax has been waived this year. However, each county must shoulder the burden of purchasing 3.6 million shi of military grain at a low price of over 20 yuan per shi. This heavy burden weighs down on the shoulders of Hunan farmers. Of course, the mandatory purchase of military grain is a reality. In this province alone, there are currently 200,000 stationed and transit troops, and the number of Japanese prisoners will soon reach 100,000. The daily grain demand is enormous. This grain source cannot rely on provinces like Sichuan and Guizhou and must rely on the local province. However, due to the limited grain reserves in this province, this large-scale purchase has resulted in drastic fluctuations in grain prices. The spring famine this year has been so prolonged that we are worried about even more serious phenomena occurring in the future. It is said that in Shaping, only thirty or forty li away from this city, there have already been tragic incidents of people eating grass and tree roots.

Robbers are Abundant around Tongxiang

Crossing the Xiang River to the western suburbs, the area around Meitong Township is rife with bandits. In the past month, there have been more than a dozen robbery cases, causing travelers to hesitate. The number of people forced into risky behavior due to the pressure of life is increasing. The provincial government seems to be very concerned about the grain issue. Chairman Wu Qiwai said in a press conference that the provincial government has reduced the military grain quota from 3.6 million shi by about one million shi to alleviate the suffering of the people. At the same time, he urged the people of Hunan to actively purchase grain. The current reality is such a contradiction. If the purchase of military grain is delayed for too long, intermittently, there will be more opportunities for grain prices to fluctuate, and grain prices will never be stable. In reality, the people of Hunan currently do not have the strength to make a large-scale supply. As grain prices rise, other commodity prices also fluctuate.

Small Capital to Maintain Appearances

The business situation has not increased the elements of prosperity. Stores with strong capital are "as rare as morning stars" when searching through Changsha today. After the catastrophe, nineteen out of ten are partnerships of small capital, collecting some goods to maintain appearances. According to the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, before the war, there were more than 80 businesses in this city, but less than half have applied for registration, and the rest are unable to recover. The Chamber of Commerce once telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting a two million yuan allocation for revolving relief, but there has been no response to date. The weak purchasing power of the people is naturally the reason for the commercial depression. Chairman Wu of the provincial government made the following statistics at another reception: Among the 78 counties and cities in the province, 54 were attacked and disturbed by the enemy, and the remaining 24 counties, such as Yuanling, Chenxi, and Zhijiang, were heavily bombed by enemy planes. More than 570,000 people died directly from the enemy's actions, and the number of indirect deaths has not yet been calculated. The total value of various material losses reached 113,264,560,499,980 yuan. This statistic cannot be seen as an exaggeration. Taking Changsha as an example, according to Mayor Li's report: more than 90% of the houses were destroyed. The broken walls and rubble are a desolate sight. The vitality of the people has been greatly damaged, and Changsha accurately reflects this trauma.

Building Low Houses to Shelter from Wind and Rain

Now, hundreds of thousands of people have returned to Changsha and are starting to rebuild their homes from the desolate ruins. Silently and arduously, they collect the remaining bricks and tiles and build low houses on the ruins that are as small as pigeon cages, barely enough to shelter from the wind and rain. The owners of the ruins have returned, immediately calling them ... [illegible characters]. Their lives are like rootless duckweed, floating uncertainly. This is the current Changsha situation ... [illegible characters]. There are not many who return with large sums of gold and legal tender to build large buildings. Remote streets and alleys, except for temporary sheds, are always deserted. The stores on both sides of the street, such as South Zheng Road, Central Zheng Road, East Chang Road, and Zhongshan Road, are mostly built in a crude and makeshift manner. This is due to the depletion of the strength of the people. How easy is it to recover the grand spectacle! "Housing shortage" is the most serious problem in Changsha today. Many people who return to Changsha feel that this problem is not easy to solve. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, rents have risen. Not only is the rent calculated entirely in rice, but a small room where one can sit knee-to-knee costs at least six or seven dou of rice per month, and you must pay in advance for the next month, or half a year. This greatly increases the hardship of tenants. Due to the housing shortage, construction companies have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain.

Mobile Homes Eagerly Awaited in Hunan

Citizens are watching how the Farmers Bank's housing construction loans will be implemented, how the Hunan Post-War Relief Branch will expand the construction of low-income housing, and whether the shipment of American mobile homes to Hunan will truly materialize.

### Scientific Shipbuilding Industry Achieves High Success: British Shipbuilding Research Association Establishes New Goals

[Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department] The products of the Clyde shipyards in the United Kingdom are world-famous. The giant ships they have built one after another, such as the "Aquitania," the "Lusitania," the "Queen Mary," and the "Queen Elizabeth," were the largest and fastest at the time of their appearance. However, the reputation enjoyed by the shipyards on the northeast coast of England is no less than that of Clyde. They are scattered in Belfast, Birkenhead, Barrow, and other places, and have unique achievements, becoming models for the shipbuilding industry worldwide.

Location of Shipyards

When establishing a shipbuilding industry in any country, the geographical location of the shipyard is very important. The location for establishing a shipyard must meet two conditions: First, for the convenience of launching, there must be an easy waterway to the ocean. Second, the nearby area must have the main raw materials available for use. The ships of the past were all made of wood, so shipyards were everywhere in the small harbors along the British coast because Britain produced a lot of wood, and there were no problems with raw materials. Later, the raw materials for shipbuilding changed from wood to iron, and then to steel. Naturally, the shipyards far from the steel production areas gradually declined, and the shipyards near these production areas, such as the Tyne, Tees, and Clyde, quickly prospered.

Shipyards and Dry Docks

In 1935, 158 shipyards in the UK started work, mostly specializing in the manufacture of ships for inland navigation. In 1939, there were 50 shipyards manufacturing seagoing vessels, 30 of which manufactured between 10,000 and 50,000 gross tons annually, about 10 manufactured between 50,000 and 100,000 tons, 6 manufactured between 100,000 and 150,000 tons, and 4 manufactured more than 150,000 tons. The number and size of dry docks also vary from factory to factory. The largest shipyards have more than 20 docks, several of which are more than 1,000 feet long.

Wartime Shipbuilding Program

During the war, Britain's shipbuilding program was different from that of the United States or Canada. They did not focus solely on quantity. To meet the various needs of wartime transport, Britain manufactured various merchant ships, including refrigerated ships, crane ships, merchant aircraft carriers, tankers, tugboats, and various other small ships. Because these ships had special performance and designs that needed to be modified from time to time, almost all the skills of the British shipbuilding industry were applied during manufacturing, and the experience gained from this hard work is very valuable in the world's shipbuilding industry.

Froude Institute

Since 1871, the UK has started systematic research in the shipbuilding industry. In that year, William Froude was commissioned by the British Admiralty to build the first new type of test boat. In 1912, the UK founded the Froude Institute in memory of the engineer's contributions. Now, the institute has become part of the National Physical Laboratory. Many new types of merchant ships have been sent here for inspection at the beginning of construction. In 1936, the UK built more than 1.18 million tons of ships, of which 920,000 tons (78%) were based on the inspections in this research institute. Among other companies, the number of ship drawings submitted for inspection reached as many as 88 types.

Shipbuilding Research Association

In 1944, a British Shipbuilding Research Association was established, which is a joint organization of all shipbuilding-related groups in the UK. Their goal is to "enable the UK to achieve the highest degree of achievement in the scientific shipbuilding industry." These groups include the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation, the Admiralty, shipyards, ship repair yards, technical associations, etc. They are working together to overcome all difficulties, and they will enable "Made in the UK" seagoing vessels to continue to maintain their reputation in the shipping industry. (P.H.)

The metal workshop in a famous British shipyard, the size of the area occupied by the workshop can be seen as a sign of its grand scale.

Free Talk: Special Issue on Women and the Family

Family

### Democratized Love

— Juan Liu

The love of parents is the purest and greatest love in the world. It requires no conditions, no price. But unfortunately, in Chinese families where education is backward and most are still dominated by feudal ideas, many parents' innate pure love is tainted and damaged by traditional selfish ideas. They regard their children as their possessions. Children are placed in a position of absolute subordination and absolute control, with no independent personality, no freedom, no rights. They regard selfishness as love and confuse selfishness with love.

They despise their children's knowledge and ability to work, believing that their views are all wrong, constantly criticizing their opinions and interfering with their actions everywhere. They want their children to obey their preconceived notions and force them to believe in their arbitrary judgments. They believe that their children are not competent in everything, and they worry about everything and do everything for them. They devote themselves wholeheartedly and make unnecessary sacrifices for their children. But at the same time, they deprive their children of their will and freedom of action, blocking the development of their personality and ability. However, in the eyes of those parents, they believe that their sacrifices are entirely for the sake of loving their children. In fact, their main motivation is a selfish subconscious. The so-called "love" is just reason borrowing it to "rationalize" their behavior, so that children have no choice but to submit under this high-sounding term.

This kind of love, which is carried out in the name of love but is actually selfish, is nothing less than a chain for the children, causing them great pain that they dare not resist. For the sake of "not disobeying their parents' wishes," countless young people's happiness has been ruined, countless young people's talents have been buried, and countless young people's futures have been missed. We would rather lose love than accept this masked "kindness."

Of course, children's knowledge, experience, ability to work, and self-control are often insufficient. However, parents can only be in a position of advice, guidance, and assistance. True love is based on the principle of not harming children's independent personality, reasonable freedom, and rights. This kind of love is "democratized love," which can benefit children and gain their faith. Even though parents do not exert pressure, they will consult their parents in everything and listen to their instructions. Conversely, under "authoritarian love," for fear of excessive interference and complete control by their parents, they dare not raise problems in front of their parents when they encounter them, either suffering in silence or acting arbitrarily and going astray.

Children do not only belong to their parents and family, but also belong to themselves and society. Parents should abandon their own selfish intentions towards their children and put their children's interests first in everything, always thinking about the welfare of society. Only in this way is it true kindness.

### The Issue of Women's Political Participation in the Future

— Yang Tongfang

In today's surging tide of democracy, many people are talking about the issue of women's political participation, believing that the highest ideal of gender equality can only be realized when women obtain the right to participate in politics. If women want to be liberated from their subordinate status and strive for independence and liberation of their personality, there are at least four requirements: First, to demand political freedom and equality. Second, to demand legal freedom and equality. Third, to demand occupational freedom and equality. Fourth, to demand educational freedom and equality. These demands can only be fully met when women obtain the right to participate in politics.

The so-called issue of women's suffrage is not just the ordinary struggle for the right to vote, because the struggle for the right to vote is only one-sided. True women's political participation requires the realization of complete civil rights, including the right to vote, the right to be elected, the right to form political associations, the right to freedom of speech and thought, and the right to be appointed as officials in administrative, judicial, and all public institutions, the right to education, and the right to financial management and inheritance. When demanding these rights, all conditions must be equal to those of men.

Since women acquire the right to vote as citizens, they can determine the fate of legislators and use political power to correct the historically unreasonable laws that favor male power. If women do not enter the political arena, no matter how loudly you shout the slogan of gender equality, it will be in vain. Today, enlightened politicians in various countries already believe that women's political participation can transform politics. Even the most stubborn rulers will feel the trend of democracy and only let women step into the door of politics step by step. The United States, New Zealand, and Finland, which were the first to implement women's political participation, have shown the world the excellent results after women's political participation. After the industrial revolution, the family system was destroyed, and women were swept into the vortex of survival competition. Social and political changes have a direct impact on women. This has doomed the collapse of the old social system, and women's demand to exercise political power has become the trend of democracy. Indeed, the relationship between politics and women is extremely close. Politics is everyone's business, and managing everyone's business is politics. Since we recognize that women are also people and that they are endowed with all rights, we cannot deny the power they should exert in politics. Not allowing women to participate in politics is tantamount to overturning the slogan of gender equality. If women do not work hard to fight for the right to participate in politics, it is tantamount to ruining their own future happiness. Once women have the right to participate in politics, they can obtain fair legal treatment in terms of occupation, education, and marriage.

If women want to gain true suffrage, they must go through arduous struggles. In the past, countless women used their own blood and flesh to fight against the feudal forces of society and traditional ideas. In China, the "May Fourth" Movement, which mainly aimed to oppose imperialism and feudalism, broke through the etiquette of the patriarchal society of past dynasties and restored women's independent personality. They took women's political participation as the main backbone. From Beijing to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Changsha, they responded one after another, gathered a large group of women, and launched a great women's liberation movement. However, the efforts at that time did not enable women's status to be fully guaranteed. Most women were still struggling in the shackles of feudalism. It was not until the "May 30th" Massacre occurred that the women's rights movement monopolized by upper-class women entered a new stage of lower-class women's liberation. It can be seen that the power of the women's liberation movement has been slowly accumulated and has gradually expanded its influence. From then on, Chinese women have increased their own understanding of the nation and the country and have a deeper understanding of the corrupt forces that remain in the real society, which must be completely eradicated, and have strengthened their understanding and grasp of reality through practical work. By this time, the women's movement had been combined with the national liberation movement. Every woman has learned from historical lessons that the political participation movement has become the core of the entire women's liberation movement, and at the same time, they understand that only the complete liberation of the Chinese nation can achieve the final goal of political participation for the vast group of Chinese women!

The eight years of arduous resistance war in our country have further educated countless women and made them further understand the meaning of political participation. Now we have achieved the final victory, and the blood of the martyrs in the past eight years has not been shed in vain. The mission that women should bear in the future nation-building process is indeed very important. We do not want women to shout slogans in vain. We hope that the women of the great era can bear the obligations that they should fulfill to society. The highest goal of women's political participation is to enable women to participate in activities under a sound political organization, use the legitimate right to vote and be elected, and express their political opinions through the votes they cast. And show their political abilities through the activities they engage in after being elected. How can it be considered true political participation to simply obtain the same political power as men?

During the nation-building period, Chinese women must understand the importance of their own mission to the nation and the country, overcome all difficulties, and use political power to overthrow unreasonable social relations and social traditions. Cultivate their own strength to participate in politics and combine knowledge, skills, and practice. Learn and hone in the vast society. When their intelligence develops, their physical strength is strong, their will is firm, and their experience is sufficient, they can quickly obtain the same freedom and rights as men!

### Women, Women

— Edited by Dongxin

Women almost all like to be praised by others. Even the most arrogant woman always has a bit of inferiority complex. — Mora

Men marry because of love, women love to marry. — Thompson

When men go out, they often think, "What should I talk about?" When women go out, they always hesitate, "What should I wear?" — White

Anything is good to talk about, just don't talk recklessly about women's psychology: this will only show your naiveté and be laughed at by the girls. If I must talk about women, I will wait until one foot has stepped into the grave: before being caught by her, the other foot can immediately go in — Tolstoy

### How to be a Stepmother

— Baling

Being a stepmother is not an easy task. As the saying goes, "The sun in hot weather, the fist of a stepmother!" It can be seen that stepmothers are generally considered to be synonymous with ferocity in Chinese society.

However, as I see it, in our Chinese families, there are not necessarily no virtuous stepmothers; but because most women who are stepmothers rarely love the children born to their ex-wives, people generally do not talk about stepmothers; otherwise, they always believe that women who are stepmothers are not affectionate to the children born to their ex-wives, and even abuse them. This is indeed an unrealistic comment.

In order to correct the general public's view of underestimating stepmothers, it is necessary to discuss how to be a stepmother.

(1) More Rewards and Less Punishment: —Children are mostly active. Because they are active, they will often cause trouble. As a stepmother, you should use more rewards for children's mistakes to guide them to a correct path in an invisible way. Unless it is absolutely necessary, never punish them, because as a stepmother, even if you lightly punish the children, the neighbors will gossip endlessly.

(2) Lead by Example, Guide Children: —For example, children have bad habits such as getting up late, eating snacks, and not being clean. As a stepmother, in addition to guiding them with a kind attitude, you must also lead by example and guide children. Get up at a fixed time every day, don't eat snacks in front of children, keep your clothes clean, and make all the arrangements in the family beautiful and tidy by yourself. In this way, leading by example, children will definitely be influenced in an invisible way and follow suit by getting up early, not eating snacks, and being clean.

(3) Take the Opportunity to Mingle with Children—When spring arrives, "the spring is bright and beautiful" and "the birds sing and the flowers are fragrant," it is a good opportunity for a spring outing. As a stepmother, you can take advantage of the time and go out with them for a short trip and picnic when the children are on vacation, so that the children feel that the stepmother is lovely, not scary, so as to increase the relationship between mother and child.

In short, the position of a stepmother is strenuous and unrewarding. But if the stepmothers in ordinary families can treat their ex-wife's children as their own children and use the above three methods at any time, I believe that the social perception of stepmothers can definitely be changed.

### Warning to Celibates

— Yang Yongzhang

Everyone has their own philosophy and outlook on life. Celibacy is the principle advocated by those who are unwilling to marry. Of course, they have economic, sociological, and other academic reasons and bases. I won't discuss these for now. Now, I will introduce some of the "value" of celibacy from a medical standpoint.

Celibates believe that not marrying can avoid all kinds of troubles, enjoy happiness, and be free from family burdens, but the reality is the opposite. According to recent statistics, the incidence of various diseases and mortality rates are much lower for married people than for unmarried people. In other words, the latter are more likely to get sick, and unfortunately, once they fall ill, they are also more likely to die.

What is the reason for this? The lifestyles of celibates (due to the lack of a family) are mostly irregular, unlike married people who have the assistance of their wives. Therefore, they are careless about their diet and are prone to gastrointestinal diseases (such as chronic gastritis, typhoid fever, cholera, etc.); they also pay little attention to their clothing and are prone to colds and influenza. As a result, celibates are more likely to suffer from anemia and tuberculosis due to malnutrition and lifestyle imbalances. Moreover, many celibates are either frustrated or self-satisfied people, and of course, they like to smoke, eat excessively, and gamble, which more or less affects their health both physically and mentally.

Celibates, listen to my warning!

### Several Practical Issues in the Women's World

— Ling Jixi

The women's issue is closely related to the entire social issue. How can the women's issue be resolved today when everything is not yet on track? This is an undeniable fact. However, in terms of subjective aspects, we dare not underestimate ourselves, but we are also unwilling to exaggerate, like the common saying "caused by the environment, inevitable in the process," such a statement can easily push away one's own responsibility, and saying too much is very dangerous. We should frankly, bravely, critically expose our weaknesses, shout fewer slogans, and engage in more self-improvement.

Today, the solution to the women's issue mainly lies in how to enrich oneself and unite oneself, and then attack the objective obstacles. There should be mutual competition within the women's circle itself. If she is better than me, I should be even better than her, but this should not be adversarial. I am not afraid that she is better than me. If she is good, I want her to be even better. If I am better than her, I must pull her up and make her better with me. More importantly, within the women's world, there is no need to divide into factions, because we ourselves are pitiful enough. We can't even handle our own affairs well! What we need is unity and enrichment. In the future, we must pay attention to the following practical issues:

(1) Establish correct marital values.

(2) Pay attention to physical health.

(3) Petition the government to establish more nurseries.

(4) Petition the government to establish more municipal girls' middle schools and national women's universities, or increase the number of female students in municipal girls' middle schools and national women's universities.

(5) Those who have already joined the workforce should strive for progress.

### A Woman's Story

— Zhang Wanqing

Women seem to be forever immersed in a fountain of sorrow. Because of this, it is felt that women are miserable. When a woman is born, the midwife says, "It's a daughter." The mother frowns first. If there's a grandmother? She will definitely say, "A money-losing product!" Even if there are many brothers, raising one is like raising them all. As long as it's a boy, the whole family looks at him with joy. "Girls' urine smells fishy," I often heard my nanny say when I was little. Braiding two small braids and wearing a flowered dress, "This girl is annoying, she has to braid her hair! If she doesn't braid it, she looks like a boy, which is too much trouble? Boys are easier. Boys don't know how to be picky, but this little girl wants to wear it when she sees someone wearing a flowered dress!"

Girls are naturally imitative from an early age: they love to cry, love to compete for grades, have poor memory, and are petty. They often argue until their faces are red, but after a while, they are fine again. They are coquettish, lazy, and love to take the car when they go out. They apply for financial aid, but then tell their classmates, "My mom bought me a pair of leather shoes yesterday, worth tens of thousands." When filling out the application form, they write, "My family is poor, and my father's income is limited. If it weren't for the financial aid, I simply wouldn't have the opportunity to study." It's written so miserably, it makes people cry, but it's not like that at all. It's fake! They love to lie, and eight out of ten sentences are fabricated. If they hide it well, no one can tell; if they don't hide it well, they are exposed and then try to argue. They love to talk a lot, love to ask questions, and love to eat snacks, "This smoked chicken is for Dad to have with his wine. Don't watch from the side when Dad is drinking!" When Dad comes and drinks, they insist on watching from the side. Dad can't stand it and tears off a chicken leg. As he chews, Mom comes and says, "You just ate, and now you're eating chicken? Haven't I told you? Don't wander around the table! You glutton! You're not comfortable if you don't eat!" Dad might laugh, "Girls are all gluttons! You were the same when you were little! I gave it to her! I can't eat it all!" The situation is resolved, with tears in her eyes, she can't bear to throw away the chicken leg and keeps chewing it until she reaches the bone, then throws it on the ground, looks at Dad, looks at Mom, and silently slips out.

She's also grown quite pretty, just as mischievous as boys; playing soccer, she wears out a pair of shoes a month and still needs to have them resoled. Her chest is gradually rising, she knows how to be shy, her stomach hurts, she can't eat cold things, she sleeps in bed, how boring, how troublesome, boys aren't like this.

From her mother's hand, she is passed into someone else's hand, that of a young, handsome man of a similar age: going to the movies becomes a regular thing, she doesn't want to go to school; following the rhythm of the music, she spins and spins, from the dance floor to the auditorium; from applause, laughter, and praise, she enters another world: everything is new, there are fewer people, it's quiet, slowly, she learns to cook, learns to manage the household, learns to gossip, learns to be stingy, learns to show off, learns to slowly pull the zipper of her wallet when hosting guests, learns to watch the man's rickshaw, learns to argue with the man.

At first, they still make concessions, but gradually, he doesn't come back, tears and snot are useless, how long will it take to endure? Mom can't help, and Dad can't say anything excessive, so she waits, hoping that he will return one day! One or two years pass, and another family is formed, both sides are the same, both are women, both have children, both sides live. Women are fragile! They can't live without a man's support! Women give birth to women, women never stop giving birth to "people."

Women always live like this! Women should rely on men, eat ready-made meals, endure scolding, endure ridicule, endure bullying, endure being kicked out, generation after generation.

Women are not good at being independent, don't want to be independent, are unwilling to be independent, and cannot be independent. Because of this, women will always live under the thumb of men: they will be beaten, they will be bullied, they will be concubines, they will be prostitutes, they will be played with by men, they will flatter men, they will listen to men's commands, and they will be controlled by men. Women seem to have endless stories to tell, these stories have been passed down from great-great-grandmothers! Women must submit, must endure, must "cry to heaven"; endurance is a woman's duty, endurance is a woman's specialty, even if a knife is stabbed in the heart, "endure"!

One day, endurance will turn things around, those who are not good at being independent will become independent, those who don't want to be independent will become independent, those who are unwilling to be independent will become independent, those who cannot be independent will become independent! Knowledge first, skills second, work third, hardship fourth. Don't envy others, don't flatter others, enrich your knowledge, maintain your health, develop your skills, and work hard. Roll up your sleeves and go to the kitchen; pick up your pen and go to society; women no longer cry, no longer compete for grades, are no longer petty, are no longer coquettish, are no longer lazy, don't take the car much when they go out, don't lie, don't eat snacks, don't gossip, aren't stingy, don't show off, don't slowly pull the zipper of their wallets, don't watch the man's rickshaw, don't argue with men, don't rely on men's support, don't eat ready-made meals. Don't let people beat you, don't let people scold you, don't let people ridicule you, don't let people bully you, and don't let people kick you out; women should enrich their own strength, women are no longer immersed in the fountain of sorrow, women are people, women will never be sad again!

Children

### Don't Teach Children to Make Mistakes

— Shang Weicheng

When parents see their children making mistakes, almost all of them are extremely angry, followed by a beating and a stern reprimand. After scolding and beating, they consider it over. They all believe that this mistake happened by chance. If they commit it again? Then they beat and scold again. If they still keep making the same mistake? Then, the children's parents are disappointed and heartbroken: they say that this child is inherently bad, not ambitious, and even sigh and say:: I don't know what sins I committed in my previous life to raise such an unfilial child!

I dare not believe that children are born to make mistakes, but I do believe that there is such a thing as parents committing sins, and I think it is "deeply ingrained." Why not "three points"? Because these parents are still making some mistakes: this sin was not committed in a previous life, but after the child was born, in this life.

What sins have they committed? To say it is sure to make parents sad, it is the sin of teaching children, directly or indirectly, oneself—or someone else while oneself did not stop them—the methods of committing the mistakes they are committing today!

Take lying as an example. Sometimes lying is because objective conditions force them to do so, but sometimes they have a hard time if they don't lie. If the former is equivalent to the second stage of lung disease, then the latter is the incurable third stage. What is the first stage? It is the stage of being taught. Of course, I am not saying that parents will teach their children to be bad, to be vile, to lie! But I believe that facts similar to the following do exist in every family: a child, sometimes does not want to call you, or say that another person is not good, at this time, for the sake of temporary self-satisfaction, fun, holding a piece of candy in your hand, you say to the child: "You call me Niangniang, and I will give you the candy to eat," or "You scold him as a little devil, and I will like you." If the child calls you Niangniang or scolds the little devil, the reward is immediately given, the candy is taken out, or a kiss is given. Innocent children, their desires are nothing more than eating and receiving the caress of elders, and desires are unlimited. When they see something that can satisfy their desires, they instinctively want to get it. When they know that the exchange condition is to call you Niangniang or scold a little devil, even if they don't want to do so, they have to do it. Once they do this, they have completely read the first chapter of "Lying Studies"! From this, it is unconsciously imprinted in their hearts: lying is a means of satisfying desires. Once they cannot achieve a certain goal, they will unconsciously lie again as a means! Once they get used to lying, it becomes a "disease," even when there is no need to lie, even when they don't want to, they are still lying. This begins in childhood, begins in infancy!

Lying is like this, other mistakes are also like this!

For the sake of temporary interest, you will make yourself eternally troubled, and you will also harm the child for life, if you don't correct it early!

However, if the child has already made a mistake (of course, those who have not taught the child should not teach them again, and those who have taught them should stop immediately), then is the way to correct it to rely on beating and scolding to make him (her) not commit crimes again? Ordinary people think that it is definitely possible, because the child will know that committing this mistake will suffer physical and mental pain. But the fact is not so. The child will still commit it again. Why? We all know that when parents beat their children, while beating them, they always say: "You say! Will you do (say) it again next time? Say it! If you say "no," I won't beat you!" Escaping all pain is the instinct of all living things. At this time, the child has no room to resist, nor the ability to resist! It is not easy for him to listen to his parents' blame, but when he hears "If you say 'no,' I won't beat you," he gets hope, he gets a shortcut to escape the current pain, just say "no"! The child says it, the parents no longer beat him, and they think that the child has repented. In fact, the child has not thought about "no more next time" at all, what he knows is the relationship between saying "no" and "I won't beat you," which is exactly the same as the relationship between "call me Niangniang" and "I will give you the candy to eat"! Therefore, the child will not only not stop making mistakes, but he will also learn that when he commits a mistake and is punished by his parents, he can just say "no more next time" and everything will be fine! Those who can lie will lie even more, and those who can't say it and don't understand this way will be enlightened here.

Using beating and scolding as a means of correcting children's mistakes is not only insufficient to accomplish anything, it is simply more than a failure! Hauptmann said: "The feeling of repentance, to be expressed in words, cannot be seduced by saying some good words, nor can it be threatened by resorting to severe punishments." Of course, applying criminal law is still not okay! We can only use various methods to help children make them understand that difficult things cannot necessarily be solved by the form of mistakes they commit, tell them that it is better to solve them with other legitimate methods? Make them understand the bad reasons and locations for committing mistakes. Only in this way can we gradually reduce the child's mistakes.

Parents of children, please be careful with your children!
