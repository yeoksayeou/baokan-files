### Tension Increasing in Changchun City; National Army May Quickly Take Over; Communist Army in Harbin Occupies Water Source

[Our Beijing Dispatch, 11th] The National Army, advancing north along the China Chang Railway from Shenyang, has reached an area two days' march from Changchun. After the Soviet army withdrew from Changchun, officials stated that the National Army may quickly take over, but taking over Harbin would be very difficult because the National Army is very far from Harbin.

[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 11th] Now, with only three days remaining until the final Soviet withdrawal, the level of tension in the city is increasing every moment. The number of pedestrians on the streets is noticeably decreasing. All shops close their doors after 3 PM, and some large stores have already ceased operations. The sound of gunfire is no longer limited to the night; it can be heard everywhere during the day. However, since the evening of the 3rd, there have been no organized combat operations. The weather on the 10th and 11th has been good, and the airport is still being secured by security forces. Also, the Soviet "epidemic prevention unit" in Fanjiatun and other places south of Changchun has withdrawn to the city on the 10th to carry out work.

[Another Dispatch] The Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Songhua River, which supplies electricity to most of the Northeast, was "taken over" by the Communist army from the Soviet army on the 10th and renamed the Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Power Bureau. So-and-so has been appointed as the director.

[Another Dispatch] The massive building that was formerly the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army has raised our national flag, which is a symbol of great significance. The exterior of the building is a fortress in the shape of a 工 character. The four corners of the roof are upturned, resembling a palace. Most of the roof tiles are dark black. Marshal Malinovsky once established his headquarters here. Before his departure, Dong Yanping informed the Soviet side that it was intended to be used as Chiang Kai-shek's temporary residence in the future.

[Central News Agency Harbin Dispatch, 11th] The Communist army in Harbin has occupied a water source within the city and is attempting to occupy the transformer substation and the electric light factory. The area with the most Communist army presence in the city is the Majia District in the southern suburbs and the Wang Zhaotun area, with approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people, because this area is closer to the airport. Also, Communist troops from various counties in Songjiang Province have been moving towards Dehui in recent days, seemingly to strengthen the defense line in Dehui in order to prevent the National Army from advancing north.

[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 10th] The government troops advancing north along the Shen-Chang Road to take over were attacked twice by the Communist army on the 7th, suffering slight losses. On the 8th, they advanced to an area approximately 30 kilometers from Siping Street and were again subjected to fierce attacks by the Communist army. It is reported that the Communist army has now concentrated more than one division of troops in the Siping Street area and has laid thousands of landmines in the area in an attempt to prevent the government troops from advancing north. Also, the Communist army has gathered five brigades in the Benxi Lake area and launched a fierce attack on the government troops south of Fushun on the evening of the 7th, which continued until the morning of the 8th.

### Military Trio to Fly to Shenyang Today; Democratic League Invites Representatives from Both Sides to Discuss; Has Proposed Compromise Suggestions on the Northeast Issue

[Our Beijing Dispatch, 11th] The Military Trio remained in Beijing on the 11th due to business. Representatives from the three sides held an important meeting at 10 AM, which adjourned at noon. After lunch, the three sides held separate meetings. They may fly to Shenyang on the 12th. In addition to Qin Decun and Gillen, Ye Jianying will still be represented by Chen Shiqu because his dental illness has not yet healed. Executive Department members Zheng Jiemin and Robertson, as well as the Communist Chief of Staff Luo Ruiqing (representing Ye Jianying), will also accompany them for inspection, and they are scheduled to return to Beijing on the 14th. It is generally speculated that the three parties have not yet established a concrete plan on the details of resolving the Northeast issue. Officials stated that the Military Trio did not bring new instructions for the mediation work in North China, but may have instructions on the issue of restoring transportation.

[Central News Agency Beijing Dispatch, 11th] The Military Trio is delaying their departure from Beijing by one day because the American representative, General Gillen, will be meeting with American staff here.

[Our News from Chongqing] The delegation of the Democratic League hosted representatives from the government and the Chinese Communist Party yesterday evening to discuss various opinions on the issue of a ceasefire in the Northeast. Apart from increasing the opportunity for exchange and discussion, little progress has been made in the discussion of the issue. (1) Regarding the ceasefire in the Northeast, based on the ceasefire agreement announced on March 27 and the two unannounced supplementary clauses for negotiated takeover, military conflicts should cease. The two sides have different opinions. The government side believes that the takeover of sovereignty in the Northeast must not be obstructed and should be discussed first, followed by a ceasefire. The Communist side believes that the armed takeover of the seven major cities after March 27 without negotiation was a violation of the ceasefire agreement and that a ceasefire should be implemented first, followed by negotiations on a peaceful takeover. The Democratic League immediately proposed a compromise solution: both sides should immediately order a five-day ceasefire and negotiate to resolve various issues during the ceasefire period in order to peacefully take over sovereignty in the Northeast. (2) The Communist army should withdraw from areas along the Shenyang-Harbin line so that the government army can smoothly enter Changchun. (3) After the government army enters Changchun, the two sides will conduct negotiations to resolve the Northeast issue in accordance with the two major resolutions of military reorganization and the Political Consultative Conference to achieve a comprehensive solution. However, the representative of the government stated that the Northeast issue should still be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. At this point, the participants turned to discuss the reorganization of the national government, the National Assembly, and the Jiaochangkou Incident before adjourning at 10:30 PM.

### Plan for Reforming Provincial Organization Drafted

[United Press International Chongqing Dispatch, 11th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke stated today that the Central Design Bureau has drafted a plan to reform the provincial organization, dividing each province into two or more. He expects that the current 28 provinces will increase to around 60. This plan and two other alternative plans will be submitted to the National Assembly for a vote. Currently, many provinces are too large. For example, Sichuan has 45 million people, which makes it difficult to promote administration. There are also several provinces where the Nationalists and Communists each occupy half. This problem may be solved by dividing the provinces. Sun also said that 75% of the work of drafting the new constitution has been completed and will be submitted to the National Assembly next month. If there are no unexpected disputes, the Political Consultative Conference's Comprehensive Group will complete its work in two weeks. There are still two points on the constitution draft that have not been resolved: one is the veto power of the Executive Yuan over the Legislative Yuan, and the other is provincial autonomy. Although military conflicts may prompt the Communists and other parties not to attend the National Assembly, the Comprehensive Group will continue its efforts to resolve the political issues of the national unification plan. If there are no unexpected developments, the National Assembly will open as scheduled on May 5 in the capital.

Kill Our Overseas Chinese Compatriots

British Say It's Due to Incitement by Former Japanese Army

[Reuters, London, 11th] The British Colonial Secretary stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the discord between Chinese and Malays in Malaya led to the assassination of 56 Malays at the Bika Mosque on March 6th, which was caused by the Japanese army inciting animosity during the occupation. There have been conflicts in the past four months, with losses on both sides, especially in the Perak River area, which the Governor-General is closely monitoring.

Repeatedly Kidnapped by Bandits

Abdomens Cut Open and Hearts Eaten

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 10th Special Dispatch] In the past few days, new atrocities have occurred in Batavia. Children of our overseas Chinese compatriots are often kidnapped by Indonesian bandits in broad daylight. Six kidnapping cases have occurred so far. If measures are not taken to stop this, it will become even more rampant. Many of the kidnapped children are killed, and the bandits cut open their abdomens and eat their hearts, believing that this will make them invulnerable to knives and guns. The remaining human flesh is secretly sold in the market. Therefore, it is generally speculated that this kidnapping behavior is planned and has a fanatical religious background.

Engine Weighs Over 50 Tons

Will Become a Heavy Tank

[Associated Press, Chicago, 5th] If one wants to save up to wait for the new type of atomic energy car, thinking that there is no need to refuel or change oil for life, then one will definitely feel disappointed. Because the weight of its engine alone may exceed 50 tons, this new type of atomic car will inevitably become a heavy tank. Moreover, the car price is extremely expensive, and the raw materials for the atomic "fuel" alone may cost US$300,000. In addition, it is necessary to hire a specially trained scientist to serve as the driver.

### How to Rescue the Crisis in the Industrial Sector?

— Pan Tuhao

Although the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan ended in victory, national finances are depleted and people's livelihoods are ruined. This is precisely the time when all people in the country should endure hardship, strive for production, and economize on consumption to cultivate vitality. Our country is known as an agricultural nation, but we still rely on external sources for food and fuel. For clothing raw materials like flowered cloth, poor transportation in the northwest production areas leads to goods being abandoned on the ground, so we compete to purchase American and Indian cotton to supplement them. The ordering of other foreign products has become a lucrative opportunity for general industrialists and merchants. In addition, labor unrest is surging, and costs are too high, making it impossible to compete with foreign goods. As a result, factories have reduced their scale one after another, preferring to let capital become idle funds or to sell foreign goods in order to survive. If this trend continues, the entire industrial sector will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the rear areas. I feel a sense of crisis and dare not remain silent, so I express my humble opinions as follows:

(1) Adjust International Trade Policy. In the history of international trade, there are those who are called mercantilists, who aim to increase exports and reduce imports to increase national wealth. Therefore, it is also known as bullionism. Although its arguments are somewhat biased, they are not without a portion of truth. The so-called advanced and wealthy countries of today, although they have long abandoned this policy on the surface, still adhere to it in substance. In the history of tariffs, there are those who are called protectionists. When domestic industries are not yet sufficient to compete with foreign countries, they often set up barriers to the import of relevant manufactured goods for self-defense. After the end of World War II, the International Monetary Agreement was established, and countries touted the universal removal of these barriers, but internally, they were scheming against each other and unwilling to dismantle their own fences. Countries that claim to have planned and controlled economies are unwilling to open their doors. Because the world today still takes countries as units, there is no one that does not put its own interests first. Given our country's economic poverty and industrial backwardness, tariff barriers should be the last lifeline. Furthermore, national finances and people's livelihoods are extremely depleted. How can we simply rely on foreign countries for the daily necessities of life without seeking self-sufficiency? As for luxury and entertainment goods, they should all be prohibited through taxation, which is something everyone agrees on. However, since foreign exchange was formally listed, although some measures have been established to restrict the import of some non-essential goods, international trade is still an open policy in general! Not to mention that the foreign exchange fund comes from loans and is insufficient to fill the endless leak, how can the fragile civil industry sit idly by and be destroyed without protection? Therefore, international trade policy must be adjusted, and this is a matter of urgent importance. Our country's industrial sector has always had a slogan, "Promote National Goods." This phrase has become a cliché and does not seem exciting enough. But let us consider how production today compares to ten or twenty years ago? How do national finances and people's livelihoods today compare to the period when national goods were being promoted? Therefore, to prescribe the right medicine for the illness, this phrase "Promote National Goods" should be even more important today.

(2) Amend the Taxation System. The taxation of production enterprises should be lighter than that of general enterprises, especially those that are beneficial to people's livelihoods. Those that need to cultivate their strength to compete with foreign goods should also have their tax payment methods specially improved to reduce their costs. There are many precedents for this in the tax history of various countries. At this time when the war has just ended, finances are difficult, and the state is strengthening tax collection, which is unavoidable. However, in addition to replenishing the national treasury, we must consider the taxpayers' ability to bear the burden. Today's income tax, profit tax, business tax, stamp tax, etc., still need to be improved to alleviate the people's strength. In recent years, the industrial sector has been making losses covertly, and except for a very few, all are struggling hard. Merely because of inflation, there is some paper wealth on the books, but can this be truly regarded as an increase in the ability to bear the burden? This is why profit tax must be effectively reduced and exempted. The business tax was originally a behavior tax, and for behaviors that are beneficial to national finances and people's livelihoods, there is no time to support and protect them, so how can we bear to generally levy heavy taxes to frustrate their vitality? Before the business tax was changed to a central tax, the general outline of the business tax collection and its supplementary measures in various provinces were lighter on the taxation of manufacturing enterprises than on general sales industries. Today's construction plan claims to prioritize industry, but the business tax is actually heavier on industry, which is contrary to the original intention of economic construction. As for the stamp tax, which is originally a certificate tax, not only should the stamp duty on wholesale amounts be lower than that on retail amounts, but it seems unnecessary to force merchants to establish certificates for the sake of revenue when the buying and selling parties do not need certificates. Today, even for sole proprietorship industrial and commercial enterprises that do not have investment certificates, tax officials must also specify that the stamp duty be affixed to the side of the capital account according to the book value, which is certainly not the original intention of the legislation! Now that foreign companies' articles of association have finally been amended to delete the phrase "registering and operating in this country," the pressure of foreign merchant capitalism will inevitably increase, while foreign companies' tax burden on profits will be lighter. Should we consider and reduce or exempt the tax burden on our country's production enterprises? We must not remain silent.

(3) Consider Labor Standards. When economists talk about production, they must mention capital and labor as the two major factors. Today, everyone has harmonious labor-management relations as a mantra, because production enterprises can only develop if both labor and management are taken care of. Therefore, the living and welfare of workers must be taken care of by the capital side, and the labor side should not ignore the profits and burdens of the capital side. Contemporary scholars of industrial economics all praise the United States, but it should be known that whenever labor wages increase in the United States, its production index and sales price of products must also have a corresponding increase. Only in this way can it be said to be truly harmonious. If, under the oppression of foreign merchant capitalism, the fledgling industry is precarious and cannot last long, and the efficiency is decreasing and the output is decreasing, while simply unilaterally increasing wages and increasing base salaries, this can only be said to be "monotonous," how can there be any "harmony"? Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the people's livelihood is still very difficult. Any class should stop at the right time and should not seek excessive enjoyment. Look at the United States today, its general wages are still around one dollar, and people's consumption is still subject to general restrictions, which is something to think about deeply.

The above three points are clearly difficult to implement, but in order to save the unprecedented crisis in the industrial sector, it is essential that we all work together with one heart to overcome this difficulty. I have heard from the import and export industry that those in charge of trade with China in the United States have warned their exporters that China's purchasing power is weak and worrying, and they have stated that except for a few native products such as wolf skins, it is difficult for American sales to improve in China, especially silk and tea. The imbalance of import and export trade is such that even though we are not aware of it, others are already worried for us, which is a cause for concern. I have also heard from the textile industry that the Allied forces are planning to lend the textile equipment of the enemy country to flowered cloth in order to guide its resumption of work so that it can supply manufactured goods for export. Our country may still think that it is the only one in the Far East industry after the war, but how can we not think about it deeply?

### Over Ten American Merchant Ships Fully Loaded with Goods Awaiting Entry; Limited Number of Berths in the Huangpu River and Zhong River Insufficient for Mooring

[Our dispatch] In this city, only the President's Wharf at Bailianjing, Yitaixing Wharf, Gonghexing, Lanyanyu, and the former Mitsubishi Wharf north of the Waibaidu Bridge can still accommodate ships. The rest of the wharves were occupied by Japanese invaders during the war, and have fallen into disrepair and are silted up. Foreign ships have nowhere to berth except in the stream. However, after the victory, a large amount of American relief supplies arrived, and there are many ships, but the number of berths is limited. Even the barges used to unload goods are mostly damaged, resulting in insufficient supply. Not only do many ships have to anchor outside Wusongkou waiting because the berths inside the port are not empty, but also the ships that have entered the port to unload goods must remain for a considerable period of time. According to people in the shipping industry, not only are ship schedules lost, but other expenses are also staggering. Currently, the American President Lines and Fulei Shipping Company alone have more than ten ships that have entered the port and are unloading goods. Those waiting outside the port include the American President Lines' Jiexi Xu Paike, Shiweisi Mai'erweiduoliya, Kaipi Pili, and Liqinuowei Duoliya. Fulei Company's Kedikewei Duoliya, Ka'erqi Paishi, and Qiongnixue Tuo. The above-mentioned ships are carrying large quantities of relief supplies and commodities. It is said that Fulei Company's Ka'erqi Paishi is scheduled to enter the port this morning, and Qiongnixue Tuo has a total of twenty-seven passengers. The two ships are scheduled to berth at berths 43, 41, and 14. These berths are near Wusong, a long distance away. The company has decided to send a small boat to pick up the passengers this afternoon and land them at the Customs Wharf at 4 or 5 PM. In addition, there are reportedly more than five other companies' freighters anchored outside the port, all fully loaded with cargo.

Deputy Mayor He explained to reporters that if the joint guarantee law for drug prohibition is implemented in accordance with the central government's regulations, it must be a horizontal and vertical joint guarantee, that is, the neighborhood head who is caught by the police will also be subject to the same crime, but this law is unfair because it involves the general public. Therefore, Deputy Mayor He has suggested in the municipal government meeting that this method should be revised, and only the family members in the same household should be implicated. The head of the household must be jointly responsible, and the family members should also report to the authorities. Those who keep it secret must also be jointly responsible. Because (1) the head of the household is responsible for supervising all crimes (including smoking) of family members, and (2) family members should be aware of smokers in the family, so implementation is fair and reasonable, and in principle, it is still consistent with the central government's laws. He continued to say that drug prohibition is the most serious policy of the country. If it is prohibited but not implemented properly, it will inevitably produce great malpractices. Therefore, he believes that drug prohibition must be thoroughly prohibited.

### Small Foreman Suspected of Being a Traitor; Once Recruited Labor for the Enemy; Victim Returns Victorious, Wife and Children Scattered

[Report from our reporter] Cai A'ping, also known as Cai Lianxi, 44 years old, from Yangzhou, was a small foreman at the Dada Wharf in this city before the war. Recently, he was reported to the High Procuratorate by Lu Zhaozhou and Zhou Shunguo, who alleged that Cai was suspected of being a traitor. After investigation, he was indicted. Yesterday, the collegiate bench of the High Court tried the case. The informants testified in court that in April of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Cai recruited more than 40 workers in Pudong for the enemy, claiming that they were going to the city center to demolish houses and repair roads, and that they would be transported by trucks every day. At that time, because they needed to make a living, and it was within this city, and there was transportation, they saw no inconvenience and responded to the call. Who knew that after getting on the truck, they were escorted by enemy soldiers armed with guns to the North Railway Station, boarded a train to Hangzhou, and were forced to do hard labor such as building roads and carrying ammunition. Later, they were transferred to Xiaoshan, Ningbo, the Zhoushan Islands, and other places, where they were unable to eat their fill every day, and were subjected to fists and kicks at the slightest dissatisfaction. They barely survived until after the victory, when they returned to Shanghai, only to find that their wife and children had been scattered. Therefore, they requested the court to redress their grievances. The defendant argued that after resigning from his position as a small foreman at the wharf, he had made a living by running a rice stall. This was entirely due to private grudges and malicious accusations. He requested the court to investigate thoroughly. Subsequently, the prosecutor presented the indictment. Wang Hengyi, a lawyer appointed by the court, provided pro bono defense for the defendant. The court adjourned the debate and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 18th.

Li Changgeng Case

Also yesterday morning, another case was heard involving Li Changgeng collecting military rations for the enemy. The defendant stated that he had jointly established Changshi Trading Company with a Japanese man named Abe Minoru to specialize in grains, but had not had any dealings with any enemy military units. Subsequently, Abe Minoru was summoned. His testimony was the same as the defendant's. The court ordered a retrial at a later date.

### Repairing North China Railways; Political Issues More Serious Than Technical Ones; Head of the Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Team Makes Remarks After Returning to Shanghai from Inspection

[Report from our reporter] The Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Team departed on the 3rd of this month to investigate the railway situation in North China. The head of the team, Hou Jiayuan, and his party returned to Shanghai on the 9th. We are pleased to report their remarks as follows: The construction of Tanggu Port was secretly built by the enemy, and the drawings have not yet been handed over. On the surface, the layout is still livable, but there are many improper details. From an engineering point of view, improper details cannot be ignored. In addition, there are also improper aspects of the port's ship lock and the first pier. The first step of the current work is to organize dredgers and other mechanical materials, but because six months have passed, the above-ground and underground conditions have changed, and all must be re-measured and the design corrected. The Executive Yuan attaches great importance to this work, and construction will definitely begin soon to satisfy the hopes of the people. As for the rush repair of various sections of the railway, preparations are being made. Although there is a shortage of materials, and due to the previous situation, there are political issues involved, making it more difficult to send workers to advance and rush repairs than the technical issues. Although the implementation team is constantly consulting, the work efficiency is still low. Engineers have been dispatched to inspect both of the above items in detail, and the task will be completed soon, and a report will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. In the past few months, the railway authorities have done their best to repair the railway, moving sleepers and steel rails from east to west in order to quickly restore traffic.

The loan term is set at three months per term, with a monthly interest rate of three percent. However, it is now planned to conduct a pilot program for one month first, and the Bank of China has been approved to handle it.

Within one month after the loans are issued, the Grain Administration Office will assess the performance of each loan-receiving grain merchant in transporting, selling, and using the loans, and then decide whether to continue lending funds.

### Large Holders Take Profits; Public Bond Market Weakens; Hua Stock Still Struggles with Bulls and Bears

Yesterday, public bonds weakened as profit-takers exited en masse. Since large holders did not support the market, the market situation weakened. Category C bonds opened at around 4,800 yuan in the morning. Large holders tried to lure in the market before shorting, first showing around 4,950 yuan before falling to around 4,450 yuan. At noon, they struggled below 4,600 yuan. As a result, categories A, B, and E fell by more than 300 yuan compared to the previous closing. Category D bonds had fallen too much the previous day, and only fell by more than 100 yuan yesterday. Category C bonds fell by more than 400 yuan. Hua stocks were all manipulated by dealers, and the bulls and bears struggled endlessly. Although the opening felt hopeless, the bulls tried hard to support the market. Although Yong Yarn fell to 4,750 yuan, Meiya fell to 3,800 yuan, and Jingfu fell to 405 yuan, they soon gradually pulled back up and supported the market for a long time. In the middle, the situation was extremely uncertain. Until noon, the bulls did their best to pull up the market, and retail investors were slightly squeezed. Yong Yarn once rose back to 5,200 yuan, Meiya rose to 4,200 yuan, and Jingfu rose to 435 yuan. The closing at noon was slightly higher.

### Gold and Banknotes Stable

Yesterday, the exchange rate was quite stable. It opened at 1.45 million in the morning and gradually fell slightly to 1.46 million after opening. Short sellers closed their positions because of the report that the Bank of China solemnly denied the lengthening of the US dollar exchange rate, and once fell to 1.425 million, and then turned stable. At noon, it hovered around 1.44 million. In the afternoon, it was not easy for those with funds to release profits, and the stock market was closed.

Buyers returned to the sidelines, and the low price was 1,865 yuan, and then the situation stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, the gold price rose slightly and was also brought up. As a result, it rose by 15 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars were stable. Importers absorbed some, and as a result, old goods rose by 5 yuan and new goods rose by 8 yuan. Robi Hong Kong electricity was still around the previous price.

### Rice Market Stable

Yesterday, the rice market digested slowly and the prices were mediocre. There was little supply and demand for flour, and the market situation lacked ups and downs for the time being. After a sharp drop in oil prices, production and consumption were inverted. When things reached the extreme, they rebounded. Raw soybean oil stopped falling and rose, rising back to 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybeans also rose by 500 to 600 yuan along with the rise in various items, but the elimination was still slack, and there was no excessive rise.

The price of medium sugar was 46,000 yuan, and other prices also had a small following.

### Yarn and Cotton Trading Is Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated very slightly. Customer sales remained stagnant. Holders of goods insisted on the original price because the listing price of the Textile Construction Company yesterday was limited, and they were unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in a situation of resistance. There were not many transactions and there was not much change. The prices were roughly the same as before. Only the price of 20-count white airships rose by 20,000 yuan. People's minds were calm. As usual, Textile Construction Company sold cotton cloth, with a total of 19 types, and opened 20 types of Mexican cloth. Cotton yarn will be sold today.

The local spot cotton trading was completely stopped. It is expected that without special developments in the environment, cotton yarn and cotton cloth will not improve much. Manufacturers and cotton merchants have small minds and are very low in price, making negotiations difficult, so that Textile Construction and private yarn mills have no transactions to do.

### Mingqian Tea from Wenzhou; Market Price Agreed Yesterday; 500,000 Yuan per Picul; The Market Price of New Longjing Tea from Hangzhou Plummets

Mingqian New Qiang Tea is produced earliest in Wenzhou. This year, due to transportation reasons, it was delayed until recently, arriving in this city at the same time as the goods from Hangzhou. Although Hangzhou Longjing has already started to be traded, the cargo side of Wenzhou Mingqian insisted on selling, so the market has not yet opened. Yesterday, the market negotiated again, and as a result, the price was agreed at 500,000 yuan per picul. As for the new Longjing tea from Hangzhou, the source has been endless recently, and the market situation has fallen all the way. At present, the industry is discounting the price, reducing the price by 1.78 million yuan per batch, which is more than 890,000 yuan lower than before. Looking at the current situation, the number of goods arriving in Shanghai from the producing areas will continue to increase, and the support disk will not be stable.

### National University Professors Host Reporters Yesterday

Report on the Course of the Strike

[Our Dispatch] Representatives from the joint council of professors from National Chiao Tung University, Fudan University, Tongji University, National Anhwei University, and other institutions hosted reporters at the restaurant on the ninth floor of the YMCA in the Pa Hsein Chiao area of the city at noon yesterday to discuss the issue of requesting improved treatment. Chen Shih-ying, Chairman of Chiao Tung University, reported on the negotiations with Vice Minister Hang Li-wu of the Ministry of Education, stating that National University professors felt the pressure of life and launched a movement to improve treatment in February of this year, appealing to all parties. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee resolved to submit a proposal to the government for review regarding improving the treatment of teachers, and the National Political Council also resolved to request that the government substantially improve the treatment of higher education personnel. To this day, the government has ignored this. Recently, due to the strike first initiated by Chiao Tung University, Vice Minister Hang Li-wu rushed to Shanghai to handle the situation, only agreeing to find ways to increase the special living allowance by 40,000 yuan, and to change the experiment fee from 2,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan. However, these increases still require approval from higher authorities. Today, the treatment of professors is far less than that of ordinary workers, and the future is extremely worrying. The Joint Council of Representatives of Professors from National Universities and Colleges in Shanghai has resolved to continue promoting the strike movement to urge the government to substantially improve treatment. Finally, Professors Chen Da-hsieh, Ying Kung-chiu, Chang Hai-cheng, Pan Chien-ching, Liu Hsien, Wang Kung-mou, Tsai Li-peng, and Ku Pao-chang spoke successively, clarifying that this strike should not be equated with a general strike or slowdown by workers, and that what the professors are demanding should not be viewed as merely solving the most basic living needs. If they can only barely afford food, and still have to chop firewood, cook, and take care of children, how can they concentrate on teaching, and so on. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.

### General Dai Li's Style

— April 5, Nanjing Aviation News, Sent by Jiu Rong

After the death of General Dai Li, Director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, on March 17, not only Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was deeply saddened, but also all his friends were deeply mourned. This reporter pursued the past and wrote this article to express our condolences.

Studying in Childhood - Taking Cake as Lunch

General Dai came from an extremely poor family. When he was studying in his childhood, his school was very far from his home, so he had to go out early and return late every day. At noon, he would eat the cake his mother gave him. When he was admitted to military school, he never enjoyed the happiness that children had, because his father died early. So he grew up under the care of his mother. He was impressed by the story of Yue Mu's tattoo.

He was short and fat, with rough and dark skin, and deep eyes. Whether he was giving a speech or talking to his subordinates, he gave people an incredible sense of respect and majesty, especially his loud voice and vivid tone, which were full of vitality.

After September 18 Incident, The Juntong Bureau Was Born

After the September 18 Incident, in order to resist foreign aggression, the Juntong Bureau was born. At that time, the focus of the work was to punish the enemies and traitors, to eliminate corruption and people who hindered the interests of the country. Therefore, it became the enemy of the enemies and traitors, and caused resentment and hatred among corrupt officials and some political parties. At that time, their lives were very hard. Most of the subordinates wore blue cloth long shirts (at that time, blue cloth was the cheapest). The name "Blue Shirt Society" is still circulating among the people. I remember that at that time, the monthly expenses were very small, so it was common to buy a few sesame cakes to fill his stomach. This frugal style has become General Dai's habit.

Careful and Calm - Escaping Danger Many Times

General Dai was always very considerate, careful, and dedicated in everything he did. No matter what kind of turbulent environment he was in, he was still very calm. Otherwise, it would be difficult to escape danger many times. He wrote every word, folded every letter neatly. Even doing such a small thing as packing his luggage, he would do it himself.

General Dai attached great importance to the information collected by his subordinates and did not allow any fabrication or error. I heard that one subordinate was ordered to be executed because he misused a word in the information. General Dai especially hated his subordinates' corruption. A female mail inspector who was responsible for checking letters was also punished on the spot for embezzling 300 yuan.

Hard Life - No Remarriage After Death of His Wife

Their lives were very difficult. Although civil servants received salary increases one after another, they still lived under the high pressure of prices. In order to increase work efficiency and reduce personal burden, unmarried comrades, both men and women, were not allowed to marry. General Dai also did not remarry. It is said that this ban was lifted with the victory of the War of Resistance, but there were still few marriages. The burden of the family was too terrible for the revolutionary comrades.

Like a Family Head - Promoting a Pure Family Style

Their office hours were eight hours on a hard bench during the day, and two and a half hours in the evening. They only had half a day off a week. On festivals or major anniversaries, General Dai accompanied his subordinates for dinner. The subordinates regarded the group as a family, and General Dai became the head of the revolutionary family. Continuing the glorious history and promoting a pure family style were the two instructions they could not forget. No matter who they were, they all had the excellent virtues of hard work, perseverance, and willingness to endure hardship.

Annual Public Memorial Service for Martyrs

Under the leadership of General Dai, more than 100,000 comrades worked, and unfortunately, thousands of people were killed by the enemies. Every July 7, they will hold a memorial service, and the families of all the martyrs will come to pay their respects. In the memorial hall, some parents cry with the portraits of their children, and some children cry and recite the date of their parents' death and the tragic events before their death. General Dai always used "We must have an attitude that children can be taught, and a spirit that young people are admirable" to comfort the bereaved families of the martyrs. This year's × month × day, I don't know how the subordinates will mourn the leader of the underground work - General Dai!

All Bereaved Families Are Given Preferential Treatment

All the family members of the martyrs can be introduced to work in the production cooperatives. These children can enter the primary school run by the bureau to study free of charge. The teachers in the school take turns leading the class, eating, and sleeping. Because of this preferential treatment for the family members of the martyrs, they will die in the occupied areas as if they were returning home.

In Order to Arrest Traitors - Flying to Peiping Many Times

After the news of the victory came, because traffic could not be restored for a while, the National Army could not go east, and the liberated areas appeared extremely chaotic. If General Dai had not ordered the underground workers to use the power of defecting puppet troops to maintain local security, I am afraid that the liberated areas would be even more difficult to get on the right track at this time.

In order to arrest the traitors, General Dai personally flew to Peiping many times to make sure that the big and small traitors were caught. Indeed, this can at least give the good people a chance to vent their anger.

Fighting Hard All His Life - The Family Is Still Poor

He never met with newspaper reporters, and rarely attended public gatherings. He had no intention of being promoted or making a fortune, so after more than ten years of hard work, his family is still poor. He is indeed a most healthy revolutionary, so his death is not only a reason for Chairman Chiang and his subordinates to be sad, but also for the reporter to cry for the shocking bad news for the suffering motherland!

### The Water of the Yellow River Comes from Heaven - The Yellow River Control Project is Scheduled to be Completed by the End of June - Mobilizing 150,000 Workers Between Kaifeng and Zhengzhou

— April 1, Kaifeng Correspondence, Sent by Jin Ming

Isn't there a line in Li Bai's poem: "The water of the Yellow River comes from heaven"? Today, people say: The Yellow River is a yellow disaster. The severity of its disasters is a common sigh throughout the ages, deeply felt at home and abroad. For decades, the Water Conservancy Research Association has compiled statistical tables (such as the Henan Weather Forecast Experiment Comparison Table, etc.), which were completed in 1942. Summarizing the results of its experiments, it is roughly as follows in Table 128:

No Way to Control Floods - Lack of Disaster Relief

Mr. Yang Yu-tang of the Water Conservancy Research Association has written a massive "Flood Control Strategy." He said that Emperor Shun killed Gun, which has been set for thousands of years. Xia Yu dug rivers, which is a magical feat for all ages. However, since the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties in our country, there have been disasters every year. All of this is because scholars who talk about water do not follow Yu but follow Gun. Some people stubbornly stick to their own opinions out of thin air. They do not understand the principles of water management and mislead themselves and others. They do not thoroughly review according to scientific methods and directly block the Yellow River's northern flow and tributaries. When a terrible disaster is caused and the people are angry, they impeach each other, only to realize that a big mistake has been made. Some resign or ask for punishment, or no longer block the river after the event. They lack disaster relief methods, so the people suffer miserably.

In the past few years, the policies for the Yellow River control project have not met actual needs and scientific principles. According to Mr. Yang Yu-tang, there are as many as eight main policies that are not beneficial and have hidden dangers:

(1) Blocking the breach and setting up a large gate in Jing-shui Town. However, one gate cannot accommodate the entire river flow, and it will inevitably collapse as before, which is what is called storing water to drown oneself.

(2) Blocking the giant river and dredging the tributaries.

(3) Blocking the upper reaches and dredging the lower reaches.

(4) Blocking the breach without considering anything else.

(5) Blocking the breach and delaying the opening of the sluice gate.

(6) Blocking the breach and not opening the gate to release water.

(7) Blocking the breach and adding dikes to firmly guard the gates and dams.

(8) Blocking all tributaries and storing water to stop sand, but claiming that the water coming from the river flushes the sand away.

The above policies are either preventing the river or causing disasters. They are either abandoning the fundamentals or focusing on the trivial. There is no good result to be said.

Divert the Yellow River into the Wei River and Return to its Old Course

Now, the Yellow River problem is the main goal of the current restoration and construction work. This time, Mr. Ji Long-tu of the Water Conservancy Research Association firmly advocates diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River and returning to its old course. The method is: (1) Diverting the Yellow River from the area between Wuzhi and Xinxiang into the Wei River, to Tianjin, out of Dagu, Xingang, and into the sea, and guiding the Huai River into the sea. (2) Reducing the Zhongmu breach, setting up more overflow dikes, and opening the gates and dams early. (3) If we mistakenly take the Huai and Ji Rivers as the old course of the Yellow River and firmly block the breach and protect the gates and dams, then there will be drought above and flood below. Henan will be a wasteland as before, and Shandong, Hebei, and northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. (4) If the breach is not reduced and the gates and dams are not opened, then Henan will have the phenomenon of northern drought and southern water, and Anhui and Hubei will become flood-stricken areas. (5) If the breach is not firmly blocked and is blocked and breached repeatedly, then Henan will have several disasters in a year, and it will inevitably affect the neighboring provinces in the southeast. (6) The climate in winter and spring is abnormal, and the water level in various places is also rising. When summer and autumn come, the snow melts from the mountains, and heavy rains occur from time to time. At the same time, the area north of Henan is particularly dangerous, because the land is mostly wasteland, and locust plagues are easy to breed.

Project Completed Before the Flood

The most gratifying and worthy news to report to the people of the country is that the Yellow River control work has clearly entered the practical stage from the research stage. The major water conservancy plan of our country and the ten-year dike repair plan have been reviewed and approved by the government's standing committee. Under the sincere cooperation of the Ministry of Communications, the Resources Commission, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Yellow River control project has begun to be actively promoted. The required raw materials and supplies are being transported from Shanghai to Kaifeng, totaling one million tons per day, to meet the needs of the Yellow River control project. According to experts participating in this project plan, the mobilization of workers will reach 150,000 people, and it is expected to be completed at the latest before the river water rises in June of this year. After the completion of this UNRRA plan, it will enable our two million acres of land that were previously destroyed to restore its full agricultural productivity, and the "Yellow Peril" that has not been treated will be avoided in time.

Since Zhao Song blocked the Yellow River and the north flowed across the country, the province of Henan, where the crux of the waterway has not been resolved for thousands of years, has suffered exceptionally heavy water and drought disasters, and the number of times has been particularly numerous. Therefore, when the good news of the joint UNRRA, CNRRA, Ministry of Communications, and Resources Commission's Yellow River relief and treatment project came, all sectors here placed the warmest hope.

### Jin Launches Comprehensive Movement: Integrating Soldiers and Farmers

— Taiyuan Airmail Dispatch, March 20th, by Jian Chen

The land question is a major issue in world history. With the rise of modern socialism, this issue has become even more important to social policymakers and revolutionaries. The security of a nation and the rise and fall of world affairs are closely related to the land question. During the late stages of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the increasing severity of troop and food supply problems, and confined to the western Shanxi region under the jurisdiction of the Second War Zone on the east bank of the Yellow River in North China, Shanxi province, due to its uniquely difficult situation, demonstrated a revolutionary measure in the land arena: the implementation of "soldier-farmer integration." This had already been approved by a central government order in November of last year to be carried out experimentally in Shanxi Province, becoming the core of Shanxi's governance.

Origins of Implementation

The people of Shanxi have traditionally been reluctant to join the army, and the province was among the first to fall under enemy occupation. The Second War Zone relied on only a dozen of the most barren mountainous counties in western Shanxi as its base for resistance. Among these, only Da Ning, Yonghe, Xi County, Xiangning, Pu County, and Shilou County were intact. Statistics show that the entire free area had a population of no more than two million. The region was barren and the people had little savings. After young men were conscripted into the army, their families had no support. Even those who escaped amidst the chaos dared not return home. Eventually, the fields lay fallow, the source of soldiers was exhausted, the military and the people were in dire straits, and the war situation was precarious. In order to support the precarious war situation, the chief officer believed that it was necessary to achieve "more people fighting, more people farming, good people fighting, good people farming" to simultaneously address the welfare of both the military and the people. Therefore, at the administrative meeting held by the high command on August 15th of the thirty-second year of the Republic, the above sixteen-character slogan was proposed, based on which the soldier-farmer integration plan was drafted. It was remotely inspired by the "well-field" system of the Three Dynasties and the "fubing" system of the Tang Dynasty, taking their strengths and discarding their weaknesses. Furthermore, Mr. Yan claimed that it followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching of "equalization of land rights" as a fair and thorough method, which could achieve "those who till the land have land to cultivate," serving as a necessary stopping point on the way to "those who till the land own the land." Its effectiveness lies in "treating national defense issues and land issues as one and addressing them together; fusing national revolution and social revolution into one furnace to resolve them." The concrete implementation of soldier-farmer integration can be broadly divided into three major steps: organization, land allocation, and equal distribution of grain.

Organization and Land Allocation

Organization and land allocation follow the Conscription Law. All men aged eighteen to forty-seven are considered eligible for military service. Each village is taken as the unit. Every three eligible young men are organized into a soldier-farmer mutual aid group. One serves in the regular army, going off to war to defend the country, while two serve in the national army, farming at home. It is stipulated that each national army soldier must provide the regular army soldier's family with five shi of wheat and ten jin of cotton annually, as well as discretionary help with firewood, water, and other tasks that require effort but not money. Infantrymen are demobilized every three years, and cavalry and artillerymen every four years, rotating service. Those who exceed the age limit are discharged, and those who reach the age limit are organized. Organization adopts a voluntary combination method; if they cannot agree, a lottery method is used to decide. The elderly, young, and women who are below or above the eligible age can all assist in cultivation, while the national army soldier who receives land allocation is the main cultivator.

Division of Land

The division of land refers to the Land Law, in which land is re-divided, taking the residential village (as a deputy village under the administration of a governing village, which is a newly compiled system of village governance in Shanxi Province) as the unit. Each allotment does not exceed five plots, matched with good and bad land. The income from each allotment, after deducting land taxes and land rent, is sufficient to provide a net income of twenty shi of grain, enough to feed eight people and enough for two farmers to cultivate. Those assisting in cultivation are allocated food rations based on the size of their labor, while the ownership of the land remains with the landlord. The national army soldier gives the landlord one shi of wheat per tael of land silver as land rent, while the national army soldier is responsible for land taxes and other burdens. As for the land allocation method, according to the outline for land division and implementation procedures, cadres first conduct four rounds of household visits to consult with the people, then convene a village-wide propaganda meeting. After that, villagers elect three to five councilors to be responsible for implementing the land division, which is supervised and checked by village cadres to complete the work.

Equal Distribution of Grain

The equal distribution of grain refers to the Land Law, which stipulates grain equalization methods. The land grade is assessed according to land yield to eliminate the accumulated abuses of having no grain without land, land without grain, light grain for good land, heavy grain for bad land, little grain for much land, and much grain for little land. The stipulation that land rent shall not exceed 37.5% of the regular yield is used as the standard for all burdens on farmers receiving land allocation. A progressive standard table for various grain grades is drafted as the grain equalization scale to determine the grain amount for each grade of land. Grain equalization takes the residential village as the unit, ensuring that the original grain amount of the residential village does not increase or decrease, only that its burden is average and reasonable.

Relief and Education

The implementation of soldier-farmer integration leads to many related social problems, the most important of which are the care of the old and weak, and the support of the chronically ill and the helpless. The relief measures are as follows: men aged sixty-five and above, and women aged sixty and above, are organized into nursing care groups to engage in minor work. Those who cannot engage in production and have no one to support them are provided with relief rations. It is stipulated that these relief funds and rations are collected progressively from 20% of the land rent receivable by landlords. In terms of education, due to the increase in social income, compulsory education for eleven years is stipulated for citizens aged six to seventeen. 2% of outstanding students aged eighteen and above are granted public funding to attend school, ensuring equal educational opportunities.

Seizing Land from Lazybones

Lazybones among the national army soldiers who do not work hard in cultivation have their land seized and are given begging certificates, with a deadline to reform themselves before their land is restored. The ideal is to achieve "using work to guarantee life, and using life to manage behavior," aiming for a society with no idlers, no loafers, no poor people, and no ignorant people, ultimately reaching the goal of abolishing criminal law. Therefore, soldier-farmer integration is called a "treasure bowl," and the land allocation is the old family property that ancestors could not get rid of. Soldier-farmer integration does not only manage agriculture while neglecting industry and commerce, nor does it disregard wartime and peacetime, requiring everyone to serve in the regular army. Before the victory, Shanxi Province also separately compiled soldier-industry groups, soldier-mining groups, and soldier-transport groups. Commerce was not included because private businesses were abolished at that time, and all businesses were public. Soldiers are regular soldiers during wartime and can be divided into regular soldiers, national army soldiers, and workers in national defense industries during peacetime.

Current Implementation

After the victory, Yan Xishan traveled to Chongqing. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially assigned Shao Lizi and others to have a detailed conversation with Yan Xishan about soldier-farmer integration. Yan Xishan also gave lectures and introductions to all parties. The central government's explicit order for Shanxi Province to conduct trials was also issued the year before last. Therefore, the comprehensive launch of soldier-farmer integration in Shanxi Province has begun this year. What they fear is that the enemy and puppet regimes have been replaced by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is propagating the harm of soldier-farmer integration to the people in its recently occupied areas and following it up with the threat of "whoever receives land allocation will be killed." The fierce struggle during this period will inevitably be tragic, but the Shanxi authorities are still advancing with an indomitable spirit, as before. On January 4th, Bo Youcheng, the provincial government committee member in charge of soldier-farmer integration, led seventy-two core cadres to the villages of Sanjie, Shele, and Geliao Gou in the suburbs of Taiyuan to conduct practical training. Upon completing their work within twelve days, Party and state elder Zhang Puquan and domestic and foreign journalists such as Li Bowen of the United Press and the New York Times came to inspect. They all personally visited the villages where it had been implemented. Elder Zhang personally inquired in detail with the old farmers and national army soldiers. Li Bowen and others were precisely at the ceremony of granting land allocation to the national army soldiers. After returning to the city of Bing, Elder Zhang greatly praised it. The journalists must have their own separate records. After the first experiment in the recovered areas, it was followed by the promotion in twenty-five cities and counties, including Taiyuan City, Yangqu, Wutai, and Dai County. It is currently entering a period of comprehensive development. However, because winter wheat was sown into the ground last year, and spring wheat and rice are about to be sown, fearing that it would delay the farming season, while proceeding with organization, land allocation, and grain equalization, it has been announced that "whoever sows, reaps," so that farmers can cultivate with peace of mind. Also, because there are many people in the recovered areas and the Anti-Japanese War has ended, the burden on national army soldiers should be reduced and the benefits for regular army soldiers should be increased. The methods have been revised to organize six people into a soldier-farmer mutual aid group, with one person as a regular army soldier. Each national army soldier provides the regular army soldier's family with three shi of grain (half wheat and half millet) and five jin of cotton. All national army soldiers, in addition to paying preferential grain and flowers and one dou of grain for every two silver taels for help expenses, have no other burdens in any other name. A quarter of the national army soldiers are pure national army soldier groups, that is, all six people are national army soldiers. The preferential grain and flowers and help expenses that each person should pay are all allocated to the county and village expenses. If it is still not enough for the county and village to use, it will be supplemented by another levy of "reasonable burdens." The source of "reasonable burdens" is obtained from the income of non-agricultural workers in industry and commerce. Because it has been decided that young men of military age in industry and commerce will not be organized for the time being, their burdens are divided into two categories: asset interest and occupational profits, that is, money generating interest is taxed at a progressive rate, and the interest generated from labor is taxed at a progressive rate. However, this is only a preliminary proposal and has not yet been finalized. It is heard that detailed regulations are being drafted. (Midnight, March 22nd)

### The Terrifying World of Northern Jiangsu

Editor: Northern Jiangsu is now a terrifying world, especially the areas around Gao Bai and Pu County. People fleeing to Nantong are arriving every day. In the Communist army, this action is called the "Great Class Struggle of Liquidation," where grievances are avenged, and scores are settled. Assassination is encouraged, special punishments are established, such as the "landmine dragging" and "look-in history" similar to those in Shandong. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist army did not yet reveal its true colors, openly engaging in kidnapping for ransom. Now, they have changed their tactics, greatly expanding their kidnapping efforts, not inferior to the puppet army of Wang Jingwei. They arbitrarily frame the loyal and virtuous, first declaring that the home has hidden firearms and must be surrendered. If the answer is no, they will arbitrarily dig, and then they themselves will take out their own bullets and say they were dug up, and then you will have to pay hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of catties of rice. If you don't have it, they will kill you. After the Political Consultative Conference, they are greatly increasing their kidnapping and killing spree. Which article of the PCC agreement stipulates this? Who can the people of Northern Jiangsu turn to for their suffering? The government watches indifferently, while some scholars are still praising the "liberated areas" in magazines, and some elders, such as Mr. Huang Yanpei, are still blindly supporting Yan'an. I wonder if they would be willing to come and see the suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu? Alas! This great class struggle of liquidation will kill half of the good people, and the general intellectual youth are also among those being killed. Because with intellectuals, there is an obstacle to the advancement of their "democracy." I want to appeal to your newspaper on behalf of the people of Northern Jiangsu who are being framed. Please ask your newspaper to request the government to find a way to relieve our suffering. We have no other extravagant hopes, only that the Communist army kills a few fewer people. — Of course, they want to kill, who can stop them? — I humbly request your newspaper to publish this, and I will be grateful beyond words.

Respectfully wishing you peace! A Reader from Northern Jiangsu (March 30, 35th year of the Republic)

Spring and Autumn

### Grand Tour, Rhyming with Du Shao Ling's Fifty-Six

— Gu Yiqiao

In the past, at thirteen or fourteen, I began my grand tour northward, Qinghua's beautiful water and trees, morning and evening my spirit soared. The new literary revolution, Nirvana laments the phoenix, By the pond, I sang of the red candle, Shy was my poetry bag. Orchids and jasmine, A lone goose pours out its burning heart, Azure forests guard Tanzhe, Lush and green, the Western Hills are. Talented scholars gathered, The Great Harmony extends to the Eastern Sea, Bright was the Mid-Autumn Moon, Sending off the distant voyage on Double Ninth Day. The boat set off, raising sea roars, A great catastrophe arrived in Fusang, Suddenly Heaven and Earth were enraged, Tokyo turned to ashes in a single torch. I came to Cambridge as a guest, May's fragrant beauty, Rainbows flew over the waves of the river, Clouds and moon reflected in the cold pond. Brothers rejoiced to reunite, Tears flowed like waves, remembering our mother, Encouraging each other in engineering, Practical learning abandoned poetry. The giant star of the South Sea fell, I was overseas and lonely, The great river flowed east into the sea, The whole nation sobbed with sorrow. A hundred years of opium poison, The shame of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, how could we forget? Classmates, still young, Each moved to different hometowns together. Some took up the teaching whip, Peach and plum trees filled their doorways, Some participated in politics, Positions were established in court. Well-versed Confucians and learned scholars, Their writings released their wild words, I returned, traveling through Europe, Beside the White Mountains and the Black Water. Spring in Jiangnan was beautiful, In the winter month, I knocked on the Yungang Caves, Trudging through snow to find the Green Mound, Testing my horse, shooting at startled cranes. The vast road of the Great Wall, Suiyuan and Xinjiang again, Unforgettable was the September 18th Incident, Enemy cavalry entered Shenyang. The men all laid down their armor, A puppet king stood abolished, I ascended Chicken Cry Temple, Changbai Mountain was dimly lit. I sighed for the New China dream, Crown and robes of the emperor, The May Fourth youth rose up, I stood tall and proud too. The elegant Zhang family son, Danced and drank deeply, Singing aloud by the cold Yi River, The sad white poplars rustled. Grand was the January 28th Incident, I sent troops and horses busily, Shanghai's forty days, The military retreated, the people suffered. Nan Yong was just reciting, The capital moved to Bianliang, Rehe could not be defended, How could just the Northeast be lost? I bid farewell to the capital and went north, Wanting to build a Great Wall long, Yan and Yun were vast and faint, Beacon fires blazed in the southern sky. The Tanggu Truce was signed, Alas for Hebei and Chahar, Young people wept together, The former capital withdrew its troops. We spoke of punishing the rebels, Exposing the ambition of tigers and wolves, The national crisis grew more serious, The powerful neighbors became more arrogant. The top commander worried, Sharpening his sword to save the mortally wounded, Planning to build aviation, Exploring the eagle's flight through academics. Lushan prepared for the sea conference, Blood and tears wrapped our wounds, With one heart and one virtue, Different dreams woke in the same bed. Sincerity was the first to unite, Don't be sad by the shame. The Qin Oath helped Tang, Zhou Wu helped Shao Kang. We sharpened our weapons and fed our horses, Taking orders from the Central Government, The full-scale war of resistance began, Heroes gathered from all directions. Civil and military education were united, The aura began to soar, Pleading to serve the country, Shedding blood was the most glorious. Eight years of sacred war, The Hun horses drank in the blue waves, The Three Rods returned from the Long March, Kunlun glittered like clouds and snow. Suddenly, the atomic bomb was announced, A miracle even more extraordinary, I came to watch the sunset, Flying straight over the sea.

Yellow Flower Mound Festival, 35th year of the Republic, Tokyo

### Regret at the Street Stall

— Zhang Qiqu

When the celebratory firecrackers sparked the first flame in the mountain city, eager friends had already packed their luggage.

"Going back to my hometown! Going back to my hometown!" The people from Jiangnan could not help but shout. The landlord no longer mentioned raising the rent, and the people of Sichuan no longer treated the people from Jiangnan with "non-friendly" attitudes. Everyone knew, "You can't keep them here, they will all be leaving Sichuan soon!"

But "entering Sichuan is easy, leaving is hard." Originally, they came with their families, carrying packages, and boxes, escaping all the way, losing things along the way, escaping to Chongqing, where they lost almost everything. After finding a house in Chongqing and settling down, they lacked clothing for all seasons, and had no tables, chairs, or utensils. They had nothing, so they had to gradually acquire things little by little, star by star, following the ever-increasing prices. Now, they had finally built a home like a snail, and now that they had to hand it over, not to mention the economic reluctance, emotionally it was like facing partners who had shared the hard times, unwilling to abandon them like worn-out shoes. However, in reality, it was absolutely impossible to carry all those bottles and cans onto ships and airplanes, carrying them on their backs like camels all the way back to Jiangnan. So what to do?

The solution was finally quickly found! To conditionally give them to the people of Sichuan, which could avoid the burden of carrying them like a "puppet organization," and also exchange them for some legal currency to subsidize travel expenses. Or bring some Sichuan specialties like silver ear and fritillaria back to give to relatives and friends, so they wouldn't see how poor they were in Chongqing.

Within three days of the victory, Chongqing, from the busiest area around the Spirit Fortress, near the most dignified National Government, to the outskirts of Xiaolongkan, Qingmuguan, Beibei, and Nanquan, along the roads and highways, became a street stall market. The civil servants who had suffered enough for eight years were certainly the most energetic in setting up stalls and selling thoroughly. Even the small merchants who sold cigarettes, the working friends who repaired lights, and even university professors, writers, and celebrities, all did their best to display and sell those Western-style clothes, books, and pickled vegetable jars that they loved but could not "carry."

Setting up a street stall is not like buying gold and U.S. dollars, profiteering from the national crisis, or engaging in speculative business. Doing this does not damage one's reputation, nor can it be said to be greedy for profit. On the contrary, standing by the street stall can indicate: (1) I did not profiteer from the national crisis during the Anti-Japanese War, I can be worthy of the country. (2) I am not corrupt, I can be worthy of my compatriots. (3) I am going back to my hometown soon, eating fish and shrimp, to compensate for the hard days of the past eight years.

Setting up a street stall is different from the peddlers who sell artificial silk stockings for three thousand yuan a pair along the road. Setting up a street stall cannot be listed in the merchant group, and is not subject to the control of officials or bound by prices. Even the police do not dare to interfere arbitrarily. Therefore, whether sitting or standing, there is always a different kind of spirit, definitely not the same as the general small merchants.

At first, they only wanted to find a place to settle those things that could not be carried, and it would be even better if they could exchange them for some legal currency. At first, they did not dare to have the delusion of getting rich from this. Who knew that the result of setting up a street stall was that the money they sold for was several times more than the original purchase price. A daily income of eight to ten thousand yuan was indeed much more profitable than sitting in an office for eight hours a day. When they came back in the evening to calculate the accounts, facing the piles of banknotes, they couldn't help but feel their hearts bloom. If they had known that setting up a street stall was so profitable, why did they bother being civil servants in the first place?

But good times don't last long. Before long, prices rebounded. The overcoat that was originally worth 50,000 yuan, selling it for 25,000 yuan was already a joyful event. Now, looking at the streets, the coarse woolen coats hanging in the shop windows are priced at over 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. They couldn't help but regret that they were too impatient and sold too cheaply. Therefore, some people followed up and increased prices; others simply packed up their parcels and temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the business of those who raised prices was slow, and those who closed their stalls were completely frozen. Delayed and delayed, when there was really hope of leaving, they had to have a special sale, selling at half price or 33% off as old goods. Otherwise, they would have to give them to the landlord as a souvenir!

Compressing a household's belongings into fifteen kilograms, moving from Chongqing to Shanghai. Of course, pots, bowls, spoons, and other items cannot be allowed in these fifteen kilograms. However, pots, bowls, spoons, and the like are as indispensable as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. So when they arrived in Shanghai, they had to raise funds again and purchase them anew. They also had to buy some items that were a bit better than the "products of national crisis" at an even cheaper price to reward themselves. Who knew that Shanghai's prices had already soared, and it was no longer the golden age for those who "flew down from the sky and drilled out of the ground." Not to mention the big companies, even the small shops were just as cunning and intimidating. Helplessly, they had to go to Qiujiang Road to patronize the scalper stalls and look for some old things sold by the Japanese in their "grand repatriation sale" to put together. Because the pots, bowls, spoons, and the like sold by the scalper stalls were exactly what friends from Chongqing who came without seals or gold bars needed for "starting a family and building a career."

The scalper stalls marked off areas as markets, stretching endlessly. Their momentum was similar to the street stall market around Confucius Pond in Chongqing. However, the goods owners who used to sit behind the stalls were now standing in front of the stalls as customers. Affectionate wives, seeing the teacups and water bottles on the scalper stalls, couldn't help but think of those things they had heartlessly sold in Chongqing. Four glass cups were only sold for 400 yuan. What about now? Pointing to a pair of cups on the stall that were similar to the ones they sold, they asked the scalper behind the stall. The scalper stretched out a finger and said categorically: "If you're really buying, one word, 1600, not a penny less."

The wife complained to her husband, and the husband complained about the transportation. Was it really because of the difficulty of transportation and inconvenience of carrying? How did people transport crabs and pressed ducks to Chongqing, and bring Guanggan and pickled mustard to Shanghai? The so-called difficulty is just self-deception for the incompetent! Even if broken copper and scrap iron were really inconvenient to carry, why not pack more easy-to-carry banknotes and gold to bring back? In Chongqing, you could still proclaim yourself clean and honest, wearing "elbow-patched" clothes and "down-to-earth" shoes, showing your hardship. In front of the scalper stalls, I'm afraid that even if you shouted loudly to them and declared how you struggled and worked hard during the Anti-Japanese War, without profiteering from the national crisis or seizing land, no one would give you two teacups to show their condolences. Wouldn't it be like playing the lute to a cow?

### Double Flying (26)

— Zhao Qingge

"You heartless old dog! What do you want? You! You..." Mrs. Mo shouted loudly.

"Father! Father!" Lihua grabbed the hem of Old Master Mo's clothes, crying and begging for mercy.

Old Master Mo ignored her, summoning all the courage he had in his life, gritting his teeth, and hitting! hitting! hitting!

"What do I want? I want to teach you a lesson! I forbid you from going to the theater with that woman from the Weng family again! I forbid you from embarrassing me in public anymore!" Old Master Mo said breathlessly as he hit her.

Mo Sheng and Baoling both arrived. Mo Sheng forcibly pulled Old Master Mo away. Mrs. Mo seized this opportunity, stood up, and lunged forward to bite Old Master Mo's hand. Baoling quickly embraced Mrs. Mo again.

"Young master, quickly pull Madam back to the upper room," Mo Sheng said.

"No, today I must fight him to the death," Mrs. Mo stubbornly tried to rush towards Old Master Mo.

"Mom, talk about it tomorrow. Father is still drunk right now!" Baoling said, forcefully dragging Mrs. Mo towards the door.

"Mom! Mom!" Lihua also cried, pulling Mrs. Mo outwards.

"Get out of my way! You bunch of bastards!" Mrs. Mo spat at the children furiously.

"Madam! It's quiet at night, don't make a scene and become a laughingstock for the neighbors," Mo Sheng said anxiously, pleadingly.

But Mrs. Mo's anger could not be quelled. She jumped wildly; struggled; trying to retaliate against Old Master Mo, whom she believed had no right to abuse her. But Baoling dragged her until she was exhausted, and she had no choice but to walk out of the study involuntarily. She cried with grievance! She wailed loudly, and shouted herself hoarse, scolding Old Master Mo as inhuman, Old Master Mo as ungrateful.

Old Master Mo did not retort to Mrs. Mo, nor did he have the strength to hit her again. At this moment, he felt as if his heart had relaxed a lot, but his body felt so heavy that he couldn't stand. His limbs trembled into a ball, and his upper and lower jaws trembled uncontrollably, his teeth clattering against each other.

"Master, are you cold?" Mo Sheng asked with concern when he saw this situation. He helped Old Master Mo to bed.

"No... no..." Old Master Mo said tremulously.

"Master, you should reason with Madam about anything, you shouldn't resort to violence. This will only hurt your feelings more. Look how angry you are, you're also ruining your own health," Mo Sheng comforted Old Master Mo. He thought that Old Master Mo was trembling with anger.

"She won't reason with me, she always thinks that everything she does is right, she will never listen to a single word I say. Therefore, I was forced to resort to violence once. I'll let her hate me for the rest of her life!" Old Master Mo said excitedly, a painful but victorious smile appearing on his face.

### Seeking Sculpture Expert: Filial Piety of the Brothers Is Exhaustless

A Reminder That Children Should Fulfill Their Filial Duty to Avoid Regret

Editor: My late father passed away the year after the January 28th Incident, but my mother is still healthy. Although my younger brother and I do not serve her perfectly, we dare not overstep the boundaries of filial piety. Over the years, prices have been high, and we know that our service of providing food and drink has not yet comforted our kind mother. Last year, the Anti-Japanese War was won, and the sky regained its light. We were about to serve our mother and enjoy her twilight years, but alas, "A child wishes to care for his parents, but they are no longer there!" Unfortunately, our mother passed away this month. Thinking of her kindness, we will never forget it. To commemorate and continue serving both parents, we are seeking sculpture technicians and clay figure experts everywhere, so that we can create models of our deceased parents' portraits and worship them in front of the hall, as if they were still alive. But things are not going as we wish. Everywhere we look, we either encounter exorbitant prices, or the works do not resemble the original portraits. My brother and I are unhappy about this day and night. We have always known that your column specializes in serving the public, so we are especially asking you to publish this information. There are many sculpture experts in the country who know that they have the ability to create likenesses based on a sample. We respectfully hope to be informed so that we can go to the front and ask them to sculpt statues of our deceased parents (about one foot tall). My brother and I can continue to serve our parents, as if we were still in a happy family environment. Then, we would be very grateful. We also tell those who have parents in the hall but do not know how to be filial that they should fulfill their filial duty as soon as possible to avoid regret. We earnestly submit this request, hoping that you will acknowledge our sincerity. Your brothers, Chen Zhide, Fubomin, respectfully. (Address: Anlu 54)

### Responding to Readers

Wang Jinggao asks: I am 26 years old. Every spring, numerous blisters develop around the soles of my feet, some containing pus. They are extremely itchy, and when scratched, they ulcerate, appearing and disappearing. They only heal after mid-autumn, causing great pain. I have sought treatment in many ways, but none have been able to cure the root cause. Is there any effective cure or preventative measure? Also, I have small sores on my arms and legs that ooze white water and gradually enlarge to the size of silver dollars. They do not penetrate deeply into the muscles, nor are they painful or itchy. Only the outer skin is broken, with a small amount of white water. Is there a way to cure the root cause?

Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers: (A) Soak the affected area for fifteen minutes in a warm solution of potassium permanganate at a concentration of one part per thousand. Dry it, then apply 10% boric acid and nourishing powder three times a day. This may be effective. (B) The stubborn small sores on the arms and legs should be examined by drawing blood to determine if they are syphilitic. Then, decide how to treat them.

Wu Daquan asks: Due to inadequate care in my childhood, both of my eardrums are ruptured, and they are still draining pus. I constantly absorb it with cotton swabs, but it regenerates. Is there any way to stop the pus? Also, I have a lot of nasal mucus, which is worse on cold days, causing me great suffering. Is there any way to eliminate the mucus?

Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers: (A) For pus in the ears, use 3% hydrogen peroxide to wash the ears, and apply anti-inflammatory medicinal powder. At the same time, take anti-inflammatory medicine tablets internally for a few days. (B) For excessive nasal mucus, instill a 1% ephedrine solution.
