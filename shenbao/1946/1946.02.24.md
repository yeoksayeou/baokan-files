### Chairman Chiang Orders Responsible Authorities to Stabilize Finances and Suppress Prices; Flew Back to the Capital by Special Plane This Morning with His Wife

[Central News Agency, This City] Chairman Chiang is greatly concerned about the drastic fluctuations in commodity prices and the chaotic situation in the financial market in this city. He flew to Shanghai again the day before yesterday and yesterday summoned the responsible persons of various banks and financial institutions, instructing them on measures to stabilize finances and suppress commodity prices, and ordered the responsible persons to quickly bring the financial and commodity prices of this city back to normal.

The special plane "Meiling" landed at Longhua Airport at 6:05 p.m. last night. The Chairman and his wife slowly disembarked from the plane in the dim twilight, shook hands and chatted briefly with General Wedemeyer, who was waiting at the side of the plane, and nodded with a smile to Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison Li Jilan, and other welcomers before getting into a car and returning directly to the official residence on Jia'er Road to rest. Accompanying the Chairman and his wife were Director Yu Jishi, Chen Xizeng, Director Li Tiehan, Secretary Shen Changhuan, Gao Shengfen, Adjutant Feng Shengfa, Shi Juemin, Group Leader Zhu Peiji, Military Attache Wu Wenzhi, and others.

At 11 a.m. yesterday, the Chairman received General Wedemeyer at the official residence and reportedly had a long conversation about military issues. At 3 p.m., he summoned Mayor Qian, Central Bank Deputy Governor Chen Xing, Director of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office Peng Xuepei, Director of the Finance Bureau Pu Zhengdong, and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian to hear about the fluctuations in financial and commodity prices in this city and gave instructions on everything. At 3:45 p.m., he summoned Song Hanzhang, manager of the Bank of China, Zhao Dihua, manager of the Bank of Communications, Zhu Runsheng, assistant manager of the Farmers Bank, and Shen Xirui, deputy director of the Central Trust Bureau, to discuss commodity price issues. At 4 p.m., he summoned Li Shouyong, director of the Shanghai Provisional University Preparatory Class, Wu Shaoshu, chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gu Yuxiu, director of the Education Bureau. At 5 p.m., he received Mike McLeen, manager of the Associated Press, Mike McCarlhue, chief editor of the Washington Star, and Zhang Tede, publisher of the Los Angeles Daily. It is reported that the Chairman gave a brief talk to the foreign journalists. At 6 p.m., the Chairman summoned Du Yuesheng, Gong Xiaolai, and Xu Jichang again for a thorough discussion on the suppression of commodity prices in Shanghai and gave instructions on various major measures to stabilize finances and commodity prices. The Chairman, needing to return to Chongqing urgently, will leave Shanghai this morning. It is reported that General Wedemeyer specially lent his special plane for the Chairman and his wife to ride, as Wedemeyer's special plane flies extremely fast, taking only about three hours from Shanghai to Chongqing, which is almost two hours faster than the "Meiling" special plane.

### Students in Beibei District Continue to March; Go to the National Government in Groups to Petition; Demand that the Soviet Union Fulfill the Agreement

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] The faculty, staff, and students of Fudan University, National Physical Education College, Lixin Accounting School, National Drama College, Jiangsu Medical College, and the Affiliated Middle School of Central University, and the Shanghai Medical College Physician Training Class in Beibei District, after the Northeast Incident, their sentiments are extremely indignant. Originally, they planned to respond to the student parade and demonstration in the Shapingba and Ciqikou area. However, due to limited transportation, they walked a long distance and only arrived in Shapingba at about 7 p.m. last night, spending the night in Central University and Chongqing University. At 6 a.m. this morning, they came to Chongqing from Shapingba. The entire group of more than 8,000 people marched in a vast formation with excellent order, shouting slogans along the way. Onlookers were numerous, and they enthusiastically applauded and responded to this great procession. At 11 a.m., the large group went from Niujiaotuo to Guofu Road to petition the National Government. After Director Wu Wen received them on behalf of the government and talked with them, they returned to Zhong'er Road, Lianglukou, Douyou Street, Xiaoshizi Linsen Road, and the South District Road, and then returned to Lianglukou. When passing the Political Participation Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they also separated, with one or two students and one professor elected by each school forming a presidium, which took turns electing representatives to petition, requesting the government to negotiate with the Soviet Union, earnestly fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty, immediately withdraw troops, and not make further concessions to the Soviet Union.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] Most of the schools in Shapingba and Ciqikou, such as Central University and Chongqing University, have been suspended for four days. It is reported that the marching students in various schools are expected to resume classes next Monday after resting for one or two days.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Students in Chengdu held meetings several times today to plan for a demonstration tomorrow on the liberation of the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd] Students from dozens of schools, including Central University, held a grand parade to ensure the Northeast, which was well-organized and impassioned.

### Wu Dingchang Responds to Students Petitioning for Crude Oil; There Are No Secret Negotiations Between China and the Soviet Union

The Government Decides to Thoroughly Investigate the Zhang Xinfu Tragedy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] National Government Official Wu Dingchang received representatives of the petitioning students today and spoke to the students. Wu first said: "Yesterday, your patriotic march has won the admiration and sympathy of the general public, and I feel the same way. As soon as the Chairman returns to Chongqing, I will forward your opinions. I believe the Chairman will also be moved. Recently, schools in various parts of the country, such as Beijing and Shanghai, have had similar marches, which shows the patriotic enthusiasm of students across the country, which is a cause for celebration for the country. The Northeast is the Northeast of the Chinese people. Since the 'July 7th' all-out war of resistance, we have spared no sacrifice, and the purpose is to recover the Northeast, the lifeline of China. Now that the war of resistance has ended victoriously, the National Government is determined to recover sovereignty over the Northeast. I hope that you will not forget nation-building while studying, and not forget studying while building the nation. If the country has talent, the country will be saved, and there is no need for you to come here to petition." The marching members then raised questions, requesting answers: (1) What is the progress of the Sino-Soviet negotiations? Answer: There is no secret diplomacy between China and the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship has been announced, and other negotiations will be disclosed when the time comes. (2) Besides the Yalta secret conference, are there any other secret agreements? Answer: China did not participate in the Yalta secret conference and naturally knows nothing about it. Any agreement without China's participation will not be binding on China. The government will thoroughly investigate the truth of the Zhang Xinfu tragedy. After Wu finished speaking, he walked to the steps, shook hands with the leading teachers and students of various schools, and expressed his condolences.

### The Political Participation Council Also Has Eight Resolutions on the Northeast

The presidium of the congress then went to the National Political Participation Council to petition. Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Council, and Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General, received them. Secretary-General Shao addressed them, expressing his admiration for the patriotic enthusiasm of the representatives and said: "The Political Participation Council is also very concerned about the Northeast issue. The resident committee meeting of the day before yesterday had eight resolutions, which can be said to be largely the same as the hopes and goals of the representatives. All the requests will be conveyed to the participating council members." Shao said in his personal opinion: "Your motives are noble, and your purpose is to help and support the government, but you must pay attention not to increase the government's difficulties, love the country, and promote the country's true interests." They finally expressed their willingness to respect Mr. Shao's advice as an elder, but hoped that Shao would convey their demands. Many of the students who walked to petition had hoarse voices. This kind of patriotic enthusiasm gave the citizens of the capital a great feeling. Tonight, they will rest in the Qiujing Middle School in this city, and tomorrow they will take a boat back to school.

### Tianjin Arrests Speculators

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 23rd] Grain prices in Wuhan continue to soar. Yesterday, the price of medium-quality rice exceeded 25,000 yuan per picul, and citizens feel deeply threatened. According to Special Commissioner Shen of the Ministry of Food, the source of food here is becoming smoother day by day, and the continued rise in grain prices is due to the manipulation and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants, who will be investigated and dealt with according to the law. Also, it is raining continuously today, which farmers are happy about, and rice prices may stabilize.

[United Press, Tianjin, 23rd] After General Li Zongren, director of the Peiping Garrison Headquarters, announced that he would ban all trading in the city if necessary, police here suddenly arrested many speculators yesterday. They were all tied up with their hands behind their backs on the street and taken away one by one. This arrest action was mainly led by the municipal government. The municipal government also stipulated that when the price of gold reaches 200,000 yuan, all trading will be prohibited. This measure is to suppress the prices of all food and daily necessities. The municipal government authorities promised to release a large amount of food stored in Japanese warehouses at low prices.

### Thousands of Students in Shanghai Marched in the Rain Yesterday; Surrounded the Soviet Consulate and Shouted Slogans in Demonstration

[This City News] Shanghai students, in order to demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast and oppose the special status of the Northeast, specially established a rights protection movement assembly. Yesterday was the 28th anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, and while the Soviet Consulate General was holding a cocktail party to entertain Chinese and foreign military and political leaders, unexpectedly, at about 11 a.m., more than 4,000 students marched in formation from the Bund Park, surrounding the consulate and shouting impassioned slogans in demonstration. These included "Demand that the Soviet Union respect the spirit of the treaty," "Immediately withdraw Soviet troops from the Northeast," "Defend sovereignty over the Northeast," "We demand complete reception of the Northeast," "For the sake of complete sovereignty, we will not hesitate to sacrifice," "Will not accept the disguised Twenty-One Demands—Four Demands," "Down with any party that sells out the motherland," "Territorial integrity, sovereignty integrity," "Long live Chairman Chiang," "Long live the Republic of China," and they sang "March of the Volunteers" and the "Three Songs of the Exiles" in unison. The singing was tragic and touching, and the cocktail party inside the consulate continued as usual with clinking glasses. Later, student representative Feng Zhizheng stood on the wall and gave a public speech. Chief Zhu of the opening cloth group represented the reception. The student representatives presented two requests: (1) Please forward to the central government that the municipal government should deal with the Soviet negotiations with a tough attitude. (2) Regarding the Zhang Xinfu murder incident of our country's engineer, seek a thorough investigation by the central government. Chief Zhu then stated: "Mayor Qian happened to have important business and could not receive you in person, instructing me to represent him. He is greatly comforted by your enthusiasm for national affairs. I will report the matters you raised to the mayor and forward them to the central government. The mayor instructed me to ask you to convey to all the students to go back to school and study peacefully, and the representatives then resigned and left. Yesterday, a total of 76 units, including major middle schools such as St. John's, Soochow, University of Shanghai, Fu Jen, Aurora, Great China, Kwong Wah, Yuying, and Minli, participated. The front of the procession was led by a huge national flag, and the steps and actions were orderly. There were also patrol groups on bicycles to maintain order, so from beginning to end, no incidents occurred.

### Memorial for Zhang Xinfu

Starting tomorrow, students throughout the city will strike to express their grief and anger at the situation in the Northeast and will hold a memorial service for Zhang Xinfu and other eight martyrs at Aurora University at 10 a.m. on the 26th.

### The KMT and the CCP Reach Final Agreement on Military Reorganization; The Records of the Three-Man Group Will Be Announced Within Days

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] After many days of efforts, the Military Three-Man Group Conference reached a final agreement in the meeting from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. yesterday. Regarding the reorganization of the CCP army and the national army, all the matters to be resolved have reached the purpose of the agreement, except for unexpected events. The complete records of this meeting will be announced within one or two days.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Zhou Enlai declared: "The Military Group Conference reached a final agreement when it held its sixth meeting tonight, deciding on the reorganization and merger of the KMT and CCP armies." Zhou said that the details of the agreement will be announced within two or three days. Although there is no formal communique yet, authoritative sources claim that the first step in the military reorganization work is to reduce the national army to 90 divisions and the communist army to 20 divisions. The remaining agenda is to reorganize the equipment of the troops so that each division can have an average of excellent equipment, redeploy the divisions' garrison areas so that the garrison boundaries of the KMT and CCP armies are abolished, re-educate the soldiers so that all troops become national rather than partisan armies, provide vocational training for the officers and soldiers of the reorganization, and the local militia organizations can only use rifles and small weapons, and only the regular army can have heavy weapons such as artillery.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 23rd] Zhou Enlai revealed: "The Military Three-Man Group Committee, designated by the Political Consultative Conference to discuss the merger of the Chinese army, has reached an agreement, and the agreed items are as follows: (1) All troops are under the command of the Ministry of National Defense, and the minister of the ministry does not necessarily have to be a military officer. (2) Troops are strictly prohibited from interfering in political events. (3) Military officers may not hold concurrent civil servant positions. (4) The conscription system will be reformed. (5) After the communist army is reduced to 20 divisions and the national army is reduced to 90 divisions, the national army should be reorganized and merged into 50 to 60 divisions."

### WEEKLY FORUM: THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE PROBLEMS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (PART 1)

— Jin Wusheng

The principles for amending the draft constitution, as determined by the Political Consultative Conference, regarding the National Assembly, are divided into four articles as follows:

(1) All national voters shall exercise four powers, which shall be called the National Assembly.

(2) Before the implementation of a direct popular election system for the president, the president shall be elected by an electoral body jointly composed of county-level, provincial-level, and central assemblies.

(3) The recall of the president shall be exercised in the same manner as the election of the president.

(4) The exercise of the powers of initiative and referendum shall be regulated by separate laws.

A Central News Agency dispatch from February 15th regarding the second meeting of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee stated that in the discussion of the National Assembly issue, Zhou Binglin, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, and Zeng Qi advocated that the National Assembly should be a tangible organization, while Zhang Junmai, Mo Dehui, and Luo Longji advocated that the National Assembly should be an intangible organization. Luo stated that the function of the first article of the amendment principles was to abolish the National Assembly. The so-called "abolition" means changing the tangible organization into an intangible one. The discussion of this issue has not yet reached a conclusion.

The so-called tangible National Assembly probably refers to the selection of representatives and the establishment of an organizational-style institution. The so-called intangible National Assembly probably refers to a general referendum of all citizens, or an electoral body during a national general election, equivalent to the Western "Plebiscile." The National Assembly system defined in the May 5th Draft Constitution is a typical tangible one. The principles defined in this amendment are a typical intangible one. However, according to articles two and three of the principles, it appears that the powers of election and recall of the National Assembly will be temporarily exercised by another institution before a certain period. This institution is jointly composed of county-level, provincial-level, and central assemblies. Furthermore, according to the twelfth item of the amendment principles regarding the amendment of the constitution, the amendment proposal should also be submitted to this institution for a second vote. Therefore, this institution also has the power to vote on constitutional amendments. This temporary substitute institution for the National Assembly does not appear to have a formal meeting in one location, so it still falls within the scope of intangible.

A continued Central News Agency dispatch from February 16th regarding the third and fourth meetings of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee stated that the National Assembly issue was also discussed when discussing the central political system. Wang Yunwu also proposed four specific proposals:

(1) Maintain the tangible National Assembly.

(2) The duties of the National Assembly are: (A) electing the president, (B) recalling the president, (C) initiating referendums, but still submitting them to a national referendum, (D) creating legislative principles, but the Legislative Yuan shall formulate bills based on these principles and submit them to the people for decision, (E) listening to the government's policy guidelines.

(3) Within five years after the implementation of the constitution, the power of national referendum and the power to decide on the National Assembly's initiatives shall be exercised by all members of the national county assemblies.

(4) The National Assembly shall be re-elected every two years and meet once a year.

The first thing that should be discussed now is the advantages and disadvantages of the tangible and intangible systems. The advantage of the tangible system is that representatives are concentrated in one place, and the exercise of their powers is relatively convenient, this is one. A tangible organization's supervision of the government will not become hollow and merely symbolic, this is two. However, its disadvantage is that the National Assembly reigns above the five Yuans. Even if its powers are restricted, there is no other institution to correct it, so it is bound to form a supreme government, consolidating the five powers into one power, this is one. If various restrictions are placed on the term of office and the time interval of the representatives, the exercise of political power will seem overly empty and formalistic, this is two. Furthermore, the number of representatives must not be too large because they must meet collectively, which is not without shortcomings compared to the principles of democracy, this is three. Representatives concentrated in one place are easily manipulated and hijacked by ambitious individuals, this is four. Therefore, it is known that the tangible National Assembly has more disadvantages than advantages, and it is better to have an intangible system. However, if an intangible system is adopted directly, whether it is the people's self-administration of political power, or the exercise of political power by representatives on behalf of the people, because they are scattered throughout the country, it will be extremely difficult to initiate any powers other than the right to elect, so that they cannot be applied, and having power is equivalent to having no power.

Secondly, we should study the four kinds of direct democracy, that is, the way political power is exercised. Generally speaking, the exercise of political power can be divided into two ways: the right to request or initiate jointly, and the right to vote on the whole. The former can be called the "right of demand," and the joint signature procedure is more troublesome, but the nature is not very important. Because after various demands are established, they must still be accepted by the government or voted on by the people before they can be determined. The latter can be called the "right of ratification," and the national periodic simultaneous voting is relatively simple, but the nature is very important. Because this power is the people's final decision-making power, it is not only sufficient to determine the merits of various demands, but also sufficient to resolve disputes between governments and clarify the responsibilities of various departments. The right of demand and the right of ratification are two completely different powers, and there is no necessary connection between their exercise, according to the practices of various countries. Some only have the right of demand, similar to the petitions of citizens, some are required by law to have a vote by the people, without waiting for the people's demands, and some need to consider other circumstances to determine whether a demand should be submitted for a vote (for details, please refer to my book "Outline of Direct Democracy"). Therefore, the two powers cannot be confused.

Based on this analysis, the author has always advocated a compromise system for the design of the National Assembly, entrusting various rights of demand to a tangible National Representative Assembly, and at the same time, reserving various rights of ratification to an intangible National Assembly. This method combines the advantages of both systems without their disadvantages (refer to my book "Collection of Essays on the Five-Power Constitution" for related articles). The author has also advocated that within ten years after the promulgation of the constitution, the members of the councils of each county and city and their equivalent regions should exercise the voting rights of the National Assembly on behalf of all citizens in their respective local regions, in order to avoid practical difficulties. This coincides with the above-mentioned proposal of Wang Yunwu, which shows that our views are similar. The National Assembly advocated by Wang is what the author calls the National Representative Assembly, and the National Assembly designed by the author is simply called National by Wang. As for the temporary exercise of the national voting rights by county councilors, the author and Wang have the same opinion, only the time is slightly different.

The news dispatch about Wang's plan is not detailed, so I have excerpted the full chapter of the articles I have always advocated below for discussion:

Chapter 3 of the Draft Constitution: National Assembly and National Representative Assembly

(1) The National Assembly is composed of citizens of the Republic of China who enjoy civil rights. The acquisition of civil rights shall be in accordance with the provisions of the law.

(2) The meeting of the National Assembly shall be conducted simultaneously in districts within each county, city, and their equivalent regions.

(3) The deliberations of the National Assembly shall be conducted without discussion and by voting; the second deliberation, unless otherwise stipulated in this constitution, shall be determined by a majority of the total number of votes. The procedure for voting in the National Assembly shall be determined by law.

(4) The National Assembly shall be convened by the National Representative Assembly in accordance with the provisions of Article 22, Paragraph 1, Item 11; each session shall not exceed three days.

(5) Within ten years after the promulgation of this constitution, the members of the councils of each county, city, and their equivalent regions shall exercise the voting rights of the National Assembly on behalf of all citizens in their respective local regions.

During the aforementioned period of substitution, the meeting of the National Assembly shall be conducted within the councils of each county, city, and their equivalent regions (this article may be included in the chapter on supplementary provisions).

(6) The functions of the National Assembly are as follows:

1. To elect the presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans, as well as the president and vice president, from the list of candidates proposed by the National Representative Assembly (power of selection).

2. To ratify the recall of the president and the presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans proposed by the National Representative Assembly (power of dismissal).

3. To ratify the proposals to amend the constitution proposed by the National Representative Assembly, and the constitutional amendments proposed by it (power of approval and power of implementation).

4. To ratify the matters proposed for resolution by the National Representative Assembly in accordance with the provisions of Article 26, Paragraph 1, Items 6 to 8 (power of implementation, power of approval, and power of dismissal).

The functions in item 4 above may be executed together at the meeting for executing other items.

(7) The National Representative Assembly is composed of national representatives and is responsible to the National Assembly. The allocation of national representative seats should be proportional to the population; however, the total number of representatives shall not exceed four hundred. [To be continued]

### CHAIRMAN OVERLOOKS HIS HOMETOWN OF XIKOU; HOLDS A TEA PARTY WITH EXECUTIVES AND GENTRY BEFORE LEAVING HANGZHOU; URGES HARD WORK AND ENDURANCE TO COMPLETE THE MISSION OF NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Chairman left Hangzhou by special plane "Meiling" the afternoon before yesterday. Originally planned to go to Fenghua, but was limited by time and could not go. However, his concern for his hometown has never been forgotten, so he specially ordered the pilot to return to the sky above Fenghua to overlook his hometown, which he had not seen for nine years. At 4:40, the plane arrived at Xikou in Fenghua, flying at a low altitude of two thousand feet, and the ground scenery was clearly visible. The villagers heard the sound of the Chairman's plane and gathered in the streets to look up and cheer. The Chairman and his wife also waved frequently in the plane to indicate their greetings. The special plane circled three times above the tomb of Chiang's mother, and then flew to the Wuling School, which was bombed by enemy planes during the War of Resistance, and flew low to pay tribute, before flying east to Shanghai. Before leaving Hangzhou, the Chairman also held a tea party in the Zhejiang Provincial Government to entertain the gentry and the heads of various agencies. In his impromptu speech, he said: "Today, I meet with you all. I have no gifts to send to our relatives and friends, only to encourage each other with this sincere heart of serving the country and loving the people, that is, we must all use the heart of being hungry as if we are hungry, and drowning as if we are drowning, to save our compatriots, to revive our nation, to take the world and the country as our own responsibility, to ensure the victory of the War of Resistance, and to complete the mission of national construction. Now our War of Resistance has achieved victory, but you must all anticipate the difficulties of national construction in the future. All compatriots throughout the country must recognize that national construction is an extremely difficult task. We must, under the premise of the entire nation, have a spirit that is more vigorous than during the War of Resistance, work harder than during the War of Resistance, and especially live more frugally and endure more pain than during the War of Resistance. We must grit our teeth, bury our heads and work hard. In this way, after another eight years, perhaps we can build a new country from the dilapidated old society, so that we can be free and independent and survive in today's world. In short, our generation of compatriots must know that since we have encountered this era, suffering and endurance are our duty. We should no longer think about enjoying a comfortable life, or having better expectations for our work treatment. Our generation of people must make up our minds that in order to complete the arduous task of national construction, we must be prepared at all times to live the most painful life and undertake the most tedious work in these thirty years, so that our children and grandchildren can be spared the tragic situation of being slaves and beasts. The story of Goujian, King of Yue, who tasted bitterness, is known to every household in the country, and our victory in the War of Resistance was based on this traditional spirit. But everyone should know that Goujian, King of Yue, who tasted bitterness, was our Zhejiang sage. I hope that Zhejiang and our compatriots throughout the country will not forget the spirit of perseverance and determination to overcome difficulties and seek revenge of our predecessors, work together with one heart, work hard, never give up, and persevere, to build our China into a prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy modern country, and realize the great Three People's Principles proclaimed by our Premier, so that we can be worthy of Zhejiang, the birthplace of nationalism. This is what I offer to all our Zhejiang compatriots, and it is also my only expectation for all our Zhejiang compatriots."

### YAMASHITA TOMOYUKI, WHO DIED IN DISGRACE, ENDED HIS LIFE YESTERDAY BY HANGING

Before his execution, he said he was blameless before God.

[United Press International, Manila, 23rd] General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the former commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines, who once swept through the Malay Peninsula and captured Singapore with great fame, was executed in Los Banos today for crimes such as condoning his subordinates' slaughter of American and Filipino soldiers and civilians. The execution platform was arranged in an area of forty square feet, surrounded by green wire mesh. At the time of the execution, Yamashita was stripped of his military uniform and all symbols indicating that he was a soldier. Thus, the "Tiger of Malaya" ended his life in disgrace. Before his death, in addition to wishing the Emperor of Japan long life and prosperity, he also hoped that Japan would achieve peace. When Yamashita was escorted to the execution platform, he was accompanied by a translator and a monk. Yamashita remained calm throughout. Hours before the hanging, he told his translator: "I have done my best in performing my duties as the supreme commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines to control my troops. As I said to the Supreme Court of Manila, I have made the greatest effort to restrain my subordinates. Even though I am dying, I can say I am blameless before God. But if you say that I have no power to command the Japanese army, then I have no words to say, because my personality is like that. My country's war criminals will be tried in the Supreme Court of Manila. I hope that by your benevolence and justice, my grievances can be redressed. I acknowledge that the American military personnel have been generous and kind to me. Even though I am dead, I will never forget it. I have no complaints against my executioners. May God bless them." Yamashita's execution was the most closely guarded secret since the end of the war. Photography reporters were not allowed to approach the execution site, and the Philippine detention centers were guarded by police.

[Associated Press, Manila, 23rd] Tomoyuki Yamashita was hanged here at 3:02 a.m. this morning. He is the first major Japanese war criminal to be executed after being sentenced to death by the Allied Military Tribunal for crimes such as allowing his subordinates to kill. Accompanying Yamashita to the gallows were Ota, the former captain of the Japanese intelligence team in the Philippines, and a Japanese translator, both of whom were also sentenced to death for torturing Filipino civilians. Ota was hanged at 3:41 a.m. and remained calm before his death. The translator died at 4:17 a.m. and looked flustered at the time of his death.

### FAMINE SHADOWS OVER ALL OF INDIA; BRITAIN FACES MAJOR TEST; INDIAN SAILORS GIVE IN UNDER THREAT OF FORCE; NEW RIOTS CONTINUE IN BOMBAY AND KARACHI

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British delegation scheduled to depart for India at the end of March is very large. After the delegation arrives in India, New Delhi will be the center of talks. They will first meet with the Indian Viceroy Wavell, and then meet with Indian leaders and representatives from various provinces and states.

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 22nd] An editorial in the New Delhi Times said that due to the famine strike of Indian sailors, the mission of the British delegation is even more important. Cripps's mission to India this time is in a worse situation, and the whole situation is shrouded in famine shadows. The crisis is compounding, exacerbating the economic difficulties and political unrest. But if the great famine cannot be relieved, all rational appeals seem to be ineffective. We can say that famine is a major force in determining the form of peace.

[Reuters, Bombay, 23rd] The Indian sailors' "strike" has collapsed. The Central Strike Committee ordered the Indian soldiers in the fort barracks and on ships in the port to lay down their arms and surrender unconditionally last night, and to resume work from today.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The "Hindustan" surrendered yesterday under the threat of British artillery fire. 300 sailors on board have been arrested. Indian sailors on the "Bahadur," "Karmak," and "Himalaya" have also unconditionally resumed work today.

[Reuters, Bombay, 23rd] The government announced that since the riots that broke out on Thursday night, a total of 28 food shops have been burned or looted. This afternoon, the situation in the factory area in northern Bombay was more serious than yesterday, with crowds of rioters gathering and clamoring repeatedly. The Bombay government has warned that anyone who builds obstacles in the road will be shot on sight. The Bombay curfew has been extended from 7:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. Karachi had more than 2,000 people gathering in violation of the order. The police dispersed them with tear gas and gunfire.

### Liu Hangchen Comes to Shanghai to Preside Over Suppressing Grain Prices: Establishes a Comprehensive Approach

Official-Merchant Cooperation: Waiting to Hear Grain Merchants' Opinions Before Handling Loan Matters

(Our Dispatch) Liu Hangchen, Administrative Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday with Yang Xizhi, the Special Food Commissioner of this city. Yesterday morning, he convened a meeting of directors and supervisors of the two grain merchant associations to listen to the opinions of the grain merchants and to have a thorough discussion on the entire grain issue in this city. Vice Minister Liu believes that the current food policy does not deviate from three major principles: (1) the issue of whether there is food, (2) the issue of how much food there is, and (3) the issue of how expensive or cheap the food is. According to Commissioner Yang's interview with reporters, the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang had a bumper harvest last autumn, and the output was [redacted text due to unclarity]. Moreover, the amount sold previously was less than 30% of the output. As for the food reserves in this city, they have increased six to eight times compared to early September last year. Therefore, the issue of whether there is enough food has already been resolved. Therefore, the next step is to increase the quantity again, and the price of food will naturally decrease.

Multiple Measures Decided

Yesterday's meeting decided on multiple fundamental and palliative measures. On the fundamental side: (1) Cooperating with local governments, financial institutions, etc. to handle grain merchant loans. [redacted text due to unclarity] Sending letters to various state-run and private transportation agencies, giving preferential treatment to grain merchants and giving them priority to reduce procurement costs. (3) Strengthening the organization of grain merchant associations to prevent non-professionals from getting involved in the grain industry. On the palliative side: (1) It is planned to request the central and local governments to take effective measures in accordance with laws and regulations against those who hoard and manipulate food. (2) It is hoped that companies, factories, social groups, etc. in this city can go to the producing areas in groups to purchase rice and grain, and not purchase them in large quantities in the urban area. (3) The citizens of this city should be calm and composed and not rush to buy rice because of the rising price. (4) A reliable communication link is needed between the producing area and the sales area so that the price of food in various places will not be chaotic due to inaccurate reports. (5) It is planned to request the media to publicize and urge speculators not to use food as a target for speculative trading. Commissioner Yang then clarified the purpose of the Food Administration's sale of rice and grain, one is to increase the actual grain supply, and the other is to regulate the people's food. The method of selling is to sell to various rice shops through the Soybean and Rice Industry Association. Therefore, it is not to sell cheap rice or distribute it universally.

Official-Merchant Cooperation Measures

The conclusion of the meeting yesterday was that the government must cooperate with the grain merchants. The method of cooperation is that the government should first fully cultivate the strength of the grain merchants, provide grain merchant purchase rice loans to facilitate the financing of grain merchants, so that on the one hand, they can sell rice and grain in the market, and on the other hand, they still have sufficient funds to purchase rice in the producing area. Therefore, the authorities urgently hope that grain merchants will speed up the strengthening of their organizations so that the government can immediately start handling loan matters. As for the loan amount and plan, there will be specific regulations in the coming days.

Another report, at the meeting yesterday morning, all directors and supervisors sincerely expressed their willingness to cooperate closely with the government to suppress grain prices. Vice Minister Liu immediately limited all directors and supervisors to submit specific cooperation methods required by the grain merchants between 12:00 noon and 3:00 PM today, and continue to hold a meeting to decide on the exact methods and loan figures. Also, the rice price in this city has gradually declined, falling by more than a thousand yuan yesterday, and Bai Geng has fallen to 28,000 yuan.

The Soviet Consulate staff were particularly attentive to the Chinese guests, bowing to greet them at the gate and shaking hands as a courtesy.

### Customs Employees Once Went on Strike; Telecommunications Labor Dispute Still Unresolved; Western Restaurant Labor-Management Negotiations Break Down

They resumed work at 4:30 PM. It is reported that the workers' monthly income ranges from over 30,000 yuan at the highest to over 20,000 yuan at the lowest. Recently, due to the pressure of living expenses, they have been unable to make ends meet. They previously submitted a request to the authorities, demanding: (1) An increase in February wages to 112,000 yuan. (2) Supplementary issuance of year-end bonuses of 112,000 yuan. (3) Subsidy for loans of 112,000 yuan. (4) Future wages should increase according to the cost of living index. (5) Uniform treatment for all employee subsidies.

Repeated Discussions Yield No Results

The strike wave at the Ministry of Transportation's Telecommunications Bureau and International Radio Station had not yet subsided as of last night. Reliable sources indicate that on the 22nd at 4:00 PM, the employees sent six representatives to meet with the Bureau Director, presenting a list of demands to the Bureau. The meeting lasted until 9:00 PM. The Bureau then decided on three measures: (1) Permission to increase benefits. (2) Approval for each level to borrow 50,000 yuan uniformly. (3) A deadline for all to return to work that evening. The representatives immediately expressed acceptance, but after returning to the Bureau to convey the opinions, the colleagues considered them unsatisfactory and refused to accept them, continuing the strike. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, responsible persons from various departments convened a meeting to discuss and express their opinions, requesting the Bureau to consolidate the colleagues' first two demands into one, granting a uniform loan of 80,000 yuan regardless of position. Living allowances must be based on the Shanghai cost of living index, sufficient to support a family of six. Base salaries should be determined according to the Ministry's regulations. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, sixteen representatives were sent again to discuss with the Bureau. The Bureau, in addition to insisting on the original proposal, only agreed to allocate welfare funds and expedite the establishment of an employee welfare association. Last night, the employees held a general meeting and decided to continue the strike. It is also reported that Director Yu feels extremely troubled by handling this issue and has submitted his resignation to the General Bureau.

### Hankou Japanese Army Atrociously Murdered American Airmen Case: Deputy Director of the Military Police Intelligence Section Confesses the Circumstances of the Strangulation

[Our Newspaper News] The U.S. Military Tribunal continued to interrogate Seigawa Shoji, a private first class in the Japanese 34th Division News Section, yesterday morning regarding the Hankou murder of American airmen case. Seigawa denied participating in the parade of the three American airmen in Hankou, claiming he only saw them on the road but did see the three being hanged. He also saw one of them stand up from the ground before being hanged, so he pushed him down. He also said: "I was ordered to guard the crematorium to monitor prisoners of war to prevent them from escaping. Later, I helped carry the legs of one of the dead American airmen to the cremation site." Seigawa firmly stated that he did not know who carried out the hanging because it was at night. He only knew that Sergeant Tai Jūji (who is missing) ordered someone to bring the rope and later reported to Lieutenant Iizumi that "the three prisoners of war have been cremated."

Next, Sergeant Major Masui Shoji, Acting Deputy Director of the Hankou Japanese Military Police Intelligence Section, was interrogated. Masui testified that on the morning of December 16, 1944, he received an order from Lieutenant Colonel Akabe stating: "Today, we received an order from the division that the Chinese side will hold a parade of three American airmen. You and three other military police officers are to go and be responsible for maintaining order." He was ordered to escort the three from prison and tie them up. He also described the parade formation, saying that there were more Chinese military police than Japanese soldiers, but because there were not enough people, they could not resist when rioting crowds beat the three American airmen. He also testified that he assisted in strangling two American airmen and described the circumstances at the time. The plaintiff's defense attorney, Lieutenant Colonel West, asked if he felt sorry and compassionate for the three who were killed. Masui said he personally felt compassion, but he could not consider it at the time because it was done under orders and he could not resist.

The interrogation ended at noon yesterday and will continue next Monday. The sentencing date is expected to be next Wednesday or Thursday. The trial date for the case of the three airmen under General Doolittle who bombed Tokyo and were killed by the Japanese has not been set, but it is expected to be held after the Hankou case concludes.

Commercial News

### Speculative Activities Restricted; Gold and Currency Decline Compared to Previous Levels; Securities No Longer Publicly Traded

Yesterday, due to the removal of all telephones from the Securities Exchange Building, speculators' activities were further restricted. Some transactions moved to other locations and were conducted secretly. Relaxed news regarding the Northeast issue was published in the North-China Daily News, etc., and people's hearts were slightly calmed. At the same time, as the authorities were conducting strict investigations, money exchange businesses also feared the lessons of the Securities Exchange Building and dared not accept buying and selling of funds. Those holding goods were eager to sell at high prices, and market prices slightly weakened. If the authorities can thoroughly expand the scope [of the investigations], tense minds can gradually be calmed. The morning opening was still quoted around 1.9 million, with various parties fishing in troubled waters and acting independently. It was extremely difficult to obtain an accurate reflection of market value, and the situation was unusually chaotic. However, in reality, prices above 1.92 million were likely not genuine. Scattered bulls gradually sought to sell, and prices dropped to 1.7 million. The US dollar remained relatively stable due to settlement of cotton yarn trades, supporting the gold market, which hovered around 1.8 million. Ultimately, as the overall trend approached sunset, there was no way to stir up trouble. At noon, it struggled around 1.75 million, a decline of 110,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments remained unlisted. Fine silver was at 2,000 yuan, and silver dollars were around 1,100 yuan, with varying quoted prices. The black market interest rate initially retreated to 18% due to the Securities Exchange Building being shut down, but later rose back to 24%.

Because money exchange businesses at each station set their own standards, there was a huge spread between buying and selling quotes for foreign currencies. At the beginning of the morning, there were sellers at 2,700 yuan, gradually falling below 2,550 yuan. Yarn businesses continued to absorb, but in the afternoon, large sellers of physical goods quoted 2,600 yuan, resulting in a lack of momentum for prices to rise. In the afternoon, quotes varied around 2,550 yuan, and the result was a slight decline of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes were initially stable, then slightly weakened, with old notes trading at 430 yuan, but the result was a slight decline of 10 yuan. Securities businesses felt slightly bored with new notes, and there was no activity, also declining 10 yuan.

Only Type C government bonds had some liquidity around 1,900 yuan, but this was only temporary. Other bonds were unmarketable. Chinese and foreign stocks had no place to gather, lacked public trading, and quoted prices were difficult to estimate.

### Yarn and Cotton Fluctuated

Yesterday, the yarn market started weak and ended strong. In the early morning, people's hearts were very empty, and there was a chorus of selling. 16-count Bright yarn once fell to 940,000, but clients absorbed at low prices, and the price gradually recovered to 1,040,000 at the close, an increase of 40,000 compared to the previous day's morning price. However, 20-count Blue Phoenix and Jincheng yarns were only around 1,150,000, and Shuangma was only 1,125,000, a drop of 50,000 compared to the previous day. People's hearts were calm, and the trend was still stable. The Textile Construction Company opened sales of various woolen fabrics, silk fabrics, blankets, burlap bags, and other goods yesterday.

Yesterday's spot cotton trading was peaceful. The Textile Construction Company traded over 600 bales of American cotton 42-grade raw fine cotton Middling, with prices ranging from 100,000 yuan to 102,000 yuan. 500 bales of Dazhong grade. In addition, private yarn factories were waiting and seeing due to Saturday. Traders did Zhoupu seed cotton among themselves at 18,500 to 19,000 yuan. Market prices varied.

### Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Again Requests Allocation of Gray Fabrics

[Our Newspaper Special News] The China Textile Construction Company previously responded to the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association's letter requesting the allocation of gray fabrics, but because military needs are currently urgent, it is planning unified supply. As soon as there is some surplus, it will immediately allocate them. Now, the Association has sent another letter to the Textile Construction Company, hoping that it will consider both national and civilian needs and quickly allocate gray fabrics.

### Silk is Flat and Weak

Rayon Warehouse Receipts Prohibited from Trading

Yesterday, the silk market was quite stable, and trading was also quiet. Another lot of raw silk was quoted slightly higher at 50,000 yuan. The transaction price of another lot of raw silk was 1.65 million yuan. Due to the absolute prohibition of rayon warehouse receipt transactions starting yesterday, off-exchange dark market trading also disappeared. Yesterday's spot prices for No. 120 Tianqiao remained the same as the previous day, and there were no transactions until the afternoon. Only one piece of No. 120 semi-matte was traded in the morning at a price of 2.45 million yuan. Factory sales needed it, so they painfully purchased it. Silk goods were flat and weak. American bedding fell 30,000 yuan per hundred, and Dage Wang crepe fell slightly by 100 yuan per roll. Hongkang black and white crepe and Minsheng brocade were still quoted at the previous day's prices.

### Green Tea Sales are Quite Prosperous

Green tea varieties are still in high demand in Tianjin, Yingkou, and other places. Recently, the number transported from this city to the Tianjin area has reached more than 6,000 bundles, mostly fried green tea, and also many jasmine and pearl orchid teas. According to Tianjin merchants, tea stocks in that area are very scarce, and there may be considerable demand in the future. As for the tea market in this city, the inventory is also not very abundant. Therefore, those who hold goods mostly insist on high prices.

### Rice Prices Decline

The large-scale dumping of low-priced rice for several days, coupled with smoother supply, has led to sluggish demand on this street, and rice prices have begun to decline, each by 1,000 yuan. Yesterday, there were still thousands of stones of late indica rice being dumped, but the price remained unchanged. The flour market is trending further downstream, falling another 300-400 yuan. The soybean market uniformly fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were still flat, and Kaifeng goods fell by 1,000 yuan. The oil market fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan or more.

Film and Drama

### Constructing a Dramatic Culture [Part 2]

— Tang Shaohua

Before Confucius, the business of drama had already developed in a distorted way. Just like now, theater performers had to depend on people like Emperor Xuanzong of Tang to survive. People regarded theater performers as tools for entertainment. Therefore, those who knew a little about self-love and self-respect, and who did not want to degrade themselves into toys, were all working hard to avoid approaching drama, and sometimes even included theatrical performances in their prohibitions.

However, prohibiting theatrical performances is not necessarily beneficial to the world and people's hearts. By Confucius' time, the world and people's hearts were already declining like a river. Therefore, based on his own research and understanding of dramatic arts, he loudly called out to his disciples to use "drama to save the world." How can drama save the world? Of course, there was a strong theoretical basis behind it, so he dared to advocate this unprecedented idea that "even the sage kings would not do." (See Xunzi's "Rituals and Music" chapter.)

In order to implement his ideas, Confucius first determined the value of drama. He firmly argued that drama was not a toy for entertainment, but a tool for educating the masses. The act of performing drama was an act of education, and the performer was an educator. But how could a performer become an educator? Therefore, secondly, he noticed that in order to enhance the value of drama, it was necessary to simultaneously improve the social status of theater performers. Confucius liked to interact with theater performers throughout his life, discussing theatrical arts. He was indeed unlike the intellectual class at the time, who generally liked actors but looked down on them. He promoted the importance of this industry everywhere for theater workers. However, later on, he also realized that simply promoting in this way was still ineffective, and there must be a reason for this. After running through several countries, he invented a new method. Therefore, thirdly, he discovered that in order to improve the social status of actors, there was still a need for preliminary work, which was to review the scripts. Therefore, Confucius had the matter of "editing the poems and correcting the music," and reviewing the content of the scripts, deleting lyrics and actions that harmed the dignity of the performers.

However, he had virtue but no position. At the time, he was only reviewing scripts for society in a private capacity, so the effect was very small, only influencing his own students. According to his students' notes, Confucius' standards for reviewing drama - that is, his requirements for drama - were simply that "the sound is sufficient to bring joy without being lascivious, the text is sufficient to reason without ceasing, and the melody and rhythm are sufficient to move people's good hearts." (See Record of Music.)

Such strict requirements are naturally difficult to meet well. First, extracting the components that could be enjoyed (in a low-level way) from drama would displease Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. (The Emperor Xuanzong of Tang at that time should be represented by people like Duke Jing of Jin and Marquis Wen of Wei; the rest can be analogized.) Second, actors who relied on people like Emperor Xuanzong of Tang as their patrons to maintain their livelihoods knew that the Emperor's displeasure would immediately affect their survival, and therefore were also dissatisfied with Confucius' approach. Confucius thought of theatrical education in order to save the world, thought of improving the status of theater performers for theatrical education, and implemented script review in order to improve the status of theater performers. He single-mindedly promoted the drama movement in this way, but as a result, only his disciples knew about it, and the theater performers of the world did not understand him enough, and only knew how to worship Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. When there is an Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, there will be actors. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang is always leading the actors, so actors will always be actors, and actors can never become theatrical workers who can bear the task of education.

If we mention the construction of a theatrical culture currently, it seems that the paths we can follow are no more than these few. To improve the function of drama, we must also improve the status of theater performers. To improve the status of theater performers, it seems that we must pay attention to the content of the scripts, as well as improve the level of actors' cultivation. In a word, it is to move drama and theater workers (no longer actors) entirely from the realm of entertainment to the realm of education!

### "The Lute Song" Staged in the United States

— Translated by Yingdai

A Chinese drama, "The Lute Song," was staged in Boston. Based on Chinese classics, translated from French into American English, with Sydney Howard and Will Irwin serving as playwrights, it mixed Western ideas according to Eastern concepts. The sole purpose of this play was to eliminate the barriers between Eastern and Western people. With music composed by Raymond Scott, lyrics by Fina Hain, singing conducted by Evgeny Mulawka, and costumes and scenery by Edmund Jones. All the performers were famous American artists.

The performance was very successful. The plot was half dramatic and half poetic, with Broadway stars Jill Corbitt and Sullivan playing the male and female leads. Their acting was just right in every move. The singing part was even more pleasant. The entire performance was full of humor, and the performance style was completely in Chinese colors, suitable for the time and space. The audience forgot that they were Westerners in the last few scenes and were filled with Eastern psychology.

The story is simple, depicting a young scholar named Cai who goes to the capital to seek officialdom due to his father's orders. But he is not willing to do so psychologically. He only reluctantly leaves his beloved wife and goes to Kyoto because he cannot disobey his father's orders. After being promoted to official, the emperor ordered him to marry a royal woman. In fact, he became a criminal in Kyoto and repeatedly tried to escape, but was eventually blocked by his father-in-law and could not fulfill his wish. His parents passed away one after another in the years of famine. His wife searched for her husband thousands of miles and found him. Thanks to the achievement of his second wife, they were reunited.

In terms of personality, all the characters in the play, the young scholar has great ambitions, but no one helps him. The father is somewhat authoritarian, and the mother has tasted all kinds of hardships. The first wife is a person who listens to fate, and the second wife is a woman who sacrifices herself and is humble. Scott made the plot full of Chinese colors, and the songs he composed occasionally reflected the comedic tone. The biggest success lies in the costumes and scenery. On the first night of the performance, the theater was full, and after the audience left, everyone gained a deep impression and kept praising it.

Theater Review

### Second Honeymoon

— Chen Shiqian

"Second Honeymoon" is the sixteenth creation of the playwright and celebrated actor of London's New York, Noel Coward, originally titled "Private Lives." Li Pu adapted it, adding a scene and several characters, presumably to cater to Chinese tastes and the current times, hence the change to "Second Honeymoon," which is quite fitting for the plot.

Although there are few subplots and little action, the content and plot are rich. The director is not bad, and each actor is competent in their "role," making the performance of "Second Honeymoon" not too disappointing.

Pan Aimei as Luo Lan speaks clearly, possesses a beautiful figure, and has a natural expression, making her quite attractive to the audience. Chen Juanjuan's eye makeup is too dark (is it because I was sitting in the second row?). This diminishes her "original" beauty and is worth correcting. However, when the couple quarrels during their honeymoon in Hong Kong and the husband becomes violent, asking her to put on a "crying face" amidst the romance under the moon is quite difficult, yet she does it naturally.

Zhang Mingqiang's Qiaoqi is very successful. His expressions, language, actions, and demeanor are skillfully executed. While the director is important, the actor's own intelligence is crucial. His "gags" and "interjections" are a bit excessive, but they are not vulgar and do not cater to lowbrow interests. As for Pan Yu'an's Bai Mu, because his character is inherently "unique" in the plot, there is nothing wrong with it, but his memorization of lines still leaves room for improvement.

In fact, Noel Coward's original work is already compact and full of "meaning." Why add Mrs. Zhu and Mr. Zhu? What's the point of this kind of "gag"? Because adding Mr. Zhu is like "drawing legs on a snake," it's no wonder that Hu Xiaofeng (Huang Kai?) resorts to "clownish" actions. What's the use of this kind of farce?

The lighting and props are acceptable.

After watching it, I feel that this "play" is worth recommending, a "clever" marriage. It exists in modern society, not just in the West. Noel Coward even wrote this play in the Cathay Hotel in Shanghai. This kind of "marital change" also exists in the East!

Movie Review

### Soviet Army Bloodbath Record

— Screening at the Jinmen Theatre in Paris

During this war, various countries put a lot of effort into producing propaganda war films. However, after the war, only a few films of this type retained their value. This is because those films had a broad vision, not only portraying a specific event that happened at a particular time and place, but also displaying the universal phenomena that the era caused in humanity; they were full of emotion, not only revealing the author's own feelings, but also capturing the personality of each character in the story and the emotions that external events evoked in them, reaching a level of realism and rationality. At the same time, in terms of technique, whether in screenwriting, directing, photography, music, or performance, they were harmoniously developed to the extreme. Even after the audience had become disconnected from the era of filmmaking, and there were no longer waves of emotion within them to help the work shake their feelings, these films could still control the audience's emotions. "Soviet Army Bloodbath Record" belongs to this category of films.

The director's handling of this film immediately attracts the audience, holding them tightly and never giving them any superfluous transition shots, allowing the audience's will to wander until the "end" signal is shown on the screen. The atmosphere of the entire film can be divided into three stages: First, before the Soviet-German war was declared (actually, before it was undeclared), there was a great effort to showcase peace and happiness. From the old farmer Kaplai's visit to the ancient forest doctor to the villagers' entertainment evening, this pleasant emotion generated by the beauty and peace of life rose linearly to its peak. This emotion had not yet dissipated during the hiking trip. From then on, the German army's undeclared war rapidly shifted into the brewing of anger. However, this stage was only a kind of anger that dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. Before this anger erupted into heroic combat, it was only intensifying the suppressed components. At the same time, as the successful guiding thread for the heroic feats below, the battle along the way for Da Min and others to escort firearms, and finally the restoration of the North Star Village, was the climax of the entire story, but also the finale. The whole story ended like this.

In this story, apart from the varying amount of screen time each person has, there are no individual protagonists, but rather a group of people. Therefore, in this film, although there are many famous actors, they all have room to develop, unlike some star-studded films that only let you see the stars and not the characters in the play. Walter Huston's portrayal of the ancient forest doctor and the German military leader Colonel Haddon (played by von Stroheim), who is also a doctor, is a prominent contrast, representing the two sides of the invaded and the invader. In the end, when Gulin shoots and kills Colonel Haddon, it gives a sense of satisfaction. Flaggland and Annie Feist play a young couple, Da Min and Marina, deeply portraying the contradiction between young people's love and sacrifice. However, my personal favorite is Kim Hye-suk's portrayal of the country girl Claudia. She is talkative, cowardly, and tears stream down her face when she goes to the battlefield. She murmurs prayers for God's blessing. However, she eventually participates in the battle and becomes a martyr. The director did not create her as a natural hero, but the fact that the most cowardly people can become heroes truly represents this era.

Even more commendable are the film's photography and music. The photographer is my Chinese-American in Hollywood, the great photographer Huang Shizhan. His attainments are second to none even in Hollywood. The music aspect is the weakest in our country's film industry. However, watching "Soviet Army Bloodbath Record" shows how much the music contributed to the creation of the atmosphere. The first half has several Soviet folk songs, all of which are extremely beautiful and moving.

This film is an epic of the Soviet people's resistance to war produced by Hollywood. It is truly remarkable that two countries with such different political views, the United States, could produce such a work for the Soviet Union, and it is enough to show the greatness of democratic countries. The United States has also fulfilled its allied responsibility in film.

### Words from a Moviegoer

— Hawke

Before the movie starts, when the national anthem is played and the leader's portrait is displayed, viewers often make unintentional mistakes that urgently need to be corrected. The following are examples:

(1) When the national anthem is played, viewers are slow to stand up, and before the entire song is finished, they start to sit down at the last syllable, and their attitude is not serious at all, looking back and forth constantly.

(2) Those who are looking for seats or have just entered the venue and hear the national anthem should stop where they are and face the screen until the national anthem is finished before continuing to look for a seat. However, this is not the case. They do their own thing and act as if they don't hear the national anthem. This situation is very common.

(3) When the portraits of the Founding Father or President Chiang appear on the screen, viewers should silently and respectfully gaze at them and should not applaud or cheer. You should know that playing the national anthem is the most solemn occasion and should be kept quiet. Applauding at this time not only disrespects the leader's original intention, but also insults the entire country's representative—the national anthem—more than anything else. I have encountered this many times and feel very unhappy.

The above points are the most common. They seem simple, but their meaning is very significant. The cinema is a very complex place, with people from all countries present. A slight oversight can lead to being laughed at and losing the dignity of the nation.

As for the noise and clamor in the theaters, which is very different from before, I will not discuss it because it is not within the scope of this article. I hope that the theater management will pay attention to improvements.
