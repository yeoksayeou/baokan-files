The Secretariat then reported: (1) Reading of the minutes of the fourth general assembly, (2) Reading of the draft regulations for the review of the Constitution of the Republic of China. Discussion began, first by Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen explaining the regulations for the review committee, followed by representatives freely expressing their opinions. Speakers were extremely enthusiastic, including Song Qiaoshu, Sun Shengwu, Hu Jue, Liu Zongping, Chen Guyuan, Zhang Shiwu, Li Chukuang, Lou Tongsun, Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, Zhang Gai, Kong Geng, Zhong Tianxin, Liu Ceheng, and others.

### Representative Opinions to be Finalized; to be Submitted to the Assembly by the Presidium

[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] Opinions of representatives at the morning session of the National Assembly: (1) The third and fourth review committees should be merged, because the third review committee reviews the presidential administration and legislation, and the fourth standing committee reviews the judicial examination and supervision. It is not necessary to separate Pu Bu Lian, and should be merged into a side committee. (2) The fifth and sixth review committees should also be merged, because the fifth review committee reviews the powers of the central and local governments, and the sixth review committee has a close relationship with the provincial and county systems. (3) The comprehensive review committee should be renamed the eighth review committee to make it consistent with the names of the above seven articles. (4) The organizational components of the comprehensive review committee should be increased. Only two conveners from each review committee are too few and should be changed to three from each committee. (5) The constituents of the comprehensive committee should each have one representative unit, which is too few and should be increased to five. (6) A review committee for reviewing border issues should be added to the review committee. (7) The scope of review of the sixth review committee was originally the provincial and county system, but now "Ye Tibet" and other places can be added. (8) The nature of each committee is connected, so there is no need to merge, and it can be done in the form of a joint meeting. (9) The chapter before the chapter is also planned within the scope of the planning committee (10) The number of members of the committee selected by the presidium should be reduced to a few. (11) The scope of review of the fifth review committee is too large, and a group should be added. (12) The grouping method should be divided separately, such as national defense, diplomacy, education, etc.

[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] The fifth session of the National Assembly amended and passed the Draft Regulations for the Review of the Constitution of the Republic of China, dividing it into nine groups. In addition to the eight groups decided by the Presidium, an eighth review committee (reviewing the Mongolian and Tibetan local systems) was added. The Comprehensive Review Committee is listed as the ninth group. (Comprehensive review of mutually related matters of each group and organization of chapters and texts of the entire draft). The Comprehensive Review Committee is composed of one person mutually elected from each review committee, two persons elected from each convener, nine persons selected by the Presidium, and three persons elected from each representative unit. Each review committee may establish several small levels separately for research to facilitate progress, and relevant review committees may conduct joint reviews when necessary.

[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] The fifth meeting of the National Assembly continued at 3:30 PM on the 30th, with Wu Tiecheng as chairman. First, he reported on the results of the morning's discussion on the "Draft Regulations for the Review of the Constitution of the Republic of China," which is being summarized and will be submitted to the Chuanda Assembly for discussion after being reviewed and finalized by the Presidium.

### Representatives of the Youth Democratic Socialist Party Did Not Participate in the Supplementary Oath

[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] Representatives from both the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party were absent from the National Assembly on the morning of the 30th. It is reported that this was to avoid taking the supplementary oath. The Youth Party subsequently issued a written statement as follows: "We have always respected Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the creator of the Republic of China, and we also sympathize with our Kuomintang friends who believe in Mr. Sun's teachings. However, when Chairman Chiang submitted the draft constitution, he clearly stated that he would return power to the people and begin constitutional government. Therefore, we believe that the freedom of belief and freedom of thought stipulated in the draft constitution should be realized immediately. We respect the freedom of belief of our Kuomintang friends, while maintaining our own freedom of thought. This is why we do not participate in the supplementary oath." The Democratic Socialist Party made no statement, but did not deny when asked by reporters whether the absence was due to the oath issue. When asked whether they would take the oath separately, they replied: "It depends on the government's opinion."

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, this city] Zuo Shunsheng, a National Assembly representative of the Youth Party, took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai on the evening of the 30th and will arrive here at 8:00 AM this morning.

### Northern Representatives Advocate for the Capital to be in Beiping

[Dispatch from Shan Yang News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Article 7 of the draft constitution regarding the capital of the Republic of China stipulates that "The capital of the Republic of China shall be in Nanjing." Qi Zhihou, a representative of Suiyuan at the National Assembly, recently submitted a proposal to the Assembly, listing fourteen reasons for advocating that the capital be located in Beiping. This proposal was co-signed by 380 representatives, including Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Mo Dehui, Kong Decheng, Ding Weifen, Bai Yunti, Bo Ru, Su Ting, Tong Guanxian, and Zhao Qingyu. The original text is as follows: "In order to defend the Northeast, consolidate national defense, and prevent further invasion of our territory, it is appropriate to establish the capital in Beiping. Whether or not this should be decided by public resolution." Reasons: (1) Establishing the capital in Beiping, close to strong neighbors, is more sensitive and easier to take preventive measures and respond appropriately. (2) Beiping has a majestic terrain and can control the overall situation. (3) Beiping has convenient transportation and is a railway center. (4) Beiping is located in the population center of the nine provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Northeast, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan.

(7) Beiping has a cool climate, suitable for human health conditions, and suitable for government personnel to work all year round. (8) Establishing the capital in Beiping can attract people to develop northward and cultivate a spirit of perseverance and cold resistance to enrich the border areas.

### Representatives Broadly Express Opinions on the Draft Constitution; Mongolian Representatives Request Explicit Stipulation of the League-Banner System

[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] Various representatives at the fifth plenary session of the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 30th broadly expressed their opinions on the draft constitution. The details are as follows: Mongolian representatives Wu Yunpeng and Bai Rui stated successively: If the constitution can safeguard the interests of all ethnic groups in the country, then from the perfect draft constitution amendment, Chapter 11, "Local System," should be changed to "Provincial and County System," and the status of "League" is sometimes equated with provinces and sometimes subject to discriminatory regulations. The status of "Banner" has never been mentioned, and the word cannot be found in the entire text. However, in fact, after the independence of Outer Mongolia, the distribution of more than 7 million Mongolian compatriots in Inner Mongolia, from the Northeast to Xinjiang, is extremely important to national defense in the north. Regarding the regulations of the Mongolian League-Banner autonomous law promulgated in the past, the requirement to explicitly stipulate the League-Banner system in the constitution is not deliberately novel, nor is it a force to divide the hearts of Inner Mongolian compatriots. Treating Mongolian compatriots with high sympathy and giving them true equality is the way to consolidate national defense.

Li Zhongxiang, a representative from the Gan region, put forward two points of opinion on the catalog of the draft constitution: (1) Chapters 4 to 9, a total of six chapters, should be merged into one chapter, called "National Government," to establish the status of its ruling power organ and parallel it with Chapter 3, "National Assembly," as the political power organ. The "National Government" chapter is divided into six sections. Except for the "President" section, the word "Yuan" (院, court/branch) of the five Yuans should be explicitly stated. Otherwise, the distinction between political power and ruling power will be unclear from the beginning of the catalog. After many years, the National Assembly will tend to disappear, abandoning the teachings of the founding father completely. (2) Chapter 11, "Provincial and County System," should be revised to "Local System," otherwise administrative units other than provinces and counties will have nowhere to be placed.

He Yang, a selected representative, first stated that the amendment has three advantages: guaranteeing people's freedom, recognizing the legitimacy of political parties, and improving the status of local governments. Then he listed its shortcomings as follows: (1) The central government system is contradictory, neither a presidential system nor a cabinet system, neither a unicameral system nor a bicameral system, neither a five-power system nor a three-power system, a four-not-like, with no advantages. (2) The examination and oversight systems are not fully utilized, ignoring the elements of rule by people, violating facts and tradition. (3) Although the powers between the central government and local governments have been divided, the powers between local provinces and counties are not clear. (4) The spirit of nationalism is lacking, and the status of ethnic minorities is not taken into account. (5) National territory can be changed by law, which is not as stable as the provision in the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft that "it shall not be changed without a resolution of the National Assembly." He advocated retaining and expanding the advantages of the amendment and removing or remedying its shortcomings.

Guo Xin, a overseas Chinese representative, advocated: (1) The words "of the people, by the people, and for the people" in Article 1 should be deleted. (2) The location of the capital in Article 7 does not need to be explicitly listed in the constitution. (3) Add the words "medicine" in Article 145.

Chang Zongyou, a representative from the Anhui region, advocated that the national economy should be listed as a special chapter. In the future, the country should be built on agriculture, and more attention should be paid to agriculture.

Deng Jiayan, a selected representative, said that the provisions on the powers of examination and supervision in the draft constitutional amendment cannot give full play to their inherent advantages.

Chen Qianxi, a representative from the Sichuan region, said that if the National Assembly's constitution-making follows the teachings of the founding father, it must implement the five-power constitution, and political power and governance power must be divided. Now, the power of the National Assembly is so small that it is almost non-existent. If it is based on Montesquieu, it is acceptable, but it is not based on Mr. Zhongshan. Should people choose five powers or three powers, it should be decided first. If you want three powers, you can draft a constitution based on the parliamentary system, but you must not establish the name and abandon the reality. Constitution-making is a century-long undertaking. We cannot stubbornly be impulsive, nor can we blindly obey.

A representative from the district expressed two opinions on "Basic National Policies": (1) "National economy" cannot be generally stipulated. In the constitutions of various countries in the world, it is listed as a special chapter, and modern human economic and social activities are becoming increasingly complex. The chapter of the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft should be submitted for discussion and supplemented as necessary, which will greatly benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. (2) "Education" is also a national plan and should be listed in the draft. The provisions of the Fifth-Fifth Draft regarding free education for school-age children, national education, and education funding are all reasonable and should be adopted.

Chen Xiaowei, a representative of the Social Development Party, believed that the draft constitutional amendment lacked timeliness and national defense. If the command authority and the governance authority are not unified, it is equal to useless. It is difficult to establish a country in the "atomic age" with its regulations. Please give serious consideration to the conference. After the break from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM, Chairman Wu announced that, according to Article 31 of the Rules of Procedure, the agenda was changed to discuss the draft constitution review regulations first. Deputy Secretary-General Lei Bao reported on the amendments summarized by the Presidium. After a vote, the "Draft Amendments to the Review Regulations" was passed with 951 votes in favor and continued to be broadly discussed.

Tang Qiyu, a representative of a vocational profession in Jiangsu Province, proposed a combination of vocational election system and detailed agricultural policy.

Pi Yishu, a women representative, expressed her opinion: (1) The occupational election system is conducive to economic development and development. (2) Women account for half of the population. If they cannot participate in politics, it is not a national politics, and it is not true democracy. Try to observe any country in the world, any party with this view, are trying to support women's rights, requiring that women should account for 30% of the elections in various units.

Wang, a representative from the E district, advocated that "education" should be listed as a special chapter, and the purpose of education should be clearly stated in accordance with national conditions, and the education of the Three Principles of the People should be stipulated. Social education should also be included.

Finally, Liu Jiashu, a representative from the Gan district, said, "In the draft constitutional amendment, the regulations of the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly are completely against the teachings of the founding father and must be thoroughly revised. How many martyrs have we sacrificed for the Three Principles of the People, and how much blood and sweat have we shed? We must not rashly abandon our revolutionary goals and throw ourselves into the arms of capitalism." He often won enthusiastic approval, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### The Fifth Meeting of the National Assembly is Peaceful and Calm

— Our reporters Zhang Ming and Pu Dejie

Yu Bin appeared on the rostrum with the demeanor of a bishop, and everyone admired his dignity, kindness, and benevolence. After the first bell rang, Yu Bin was the first to take his seat and sit in the center.

Yu Bin's voice of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will was the clearest read by the chairmen in the past.

Representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party were absent in the morning, and the empty seats immediately aroused the reporter's sense of smell. After inquiring, I learned that they hoped to choose a more solemn date separately.

When the chairman mentioned discussing the methods of the review committee, someone immediately stood up to object, saying that the case should be submitted next Saturday, because only more than 30 of the 1,000-plus people had expressed their opinions on the draft constitution, and they had not achieved the freedom to exchange opinions widely. Subsequently, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen stated that the discussion of the methods of the review committee was to prepare for the convenience of the representatives to participate in the review, and it was by no means a handover of the review. This storm subsided.

Reading the regulations of the committee was the first time Lei Zhen showed his face at the meeting. This unsung hero, who had tried his best for peace talks, stood up on the stage for the first time, and many reporters felt close to him.

No. 1090 suddenly stood up and said: "I have sent a request for a speech twice, but I still haven't had a chance." The chairman immediately said: "You can speak now." This extra democratic style made the speaker flattered.

No. 1090 began, and overflowed the scope of the speech, although the audience responded with mocking and boos, but he still stubbornly said: "There are too few opportunities, I will only finish in five minutes." However, the masses were difficult to suppress, and they responded with mocking and boos. Even Minister Bai sitting in the front row laughed loudly. The chairman rang the bell and could not stop it. Finally, he himself realized that no one was listening even if he said it. After many unsuccessful negotiations, he left the stage unhappy. This farce came to an end.

When the Mongolian representative went on stage and was expressing his opinion on the frontier issue, a certain representative suddenly responded with a "Chi Chi" sound. After a while, a corner of the venue immediately fell into chaos. It turned out that a certain representative's "Chi Chi" provoked public outrage, believing that he intentionally deprived the frontier representative of the opportunity to speak. They unanimously wanted to expel him from the venue. At one time, venue staff and reporters rushed to the arguing area to interview the facts. Subsequently, the misunderstanding was resolved before it subsided. This is the second good mirror today.

Most of the female representatives paid special attention to the rights of women, but Tao Xuan, a female representative, told reporters that there was no need to stipulate the rights of women in other articles. If it is enough as it is now, because the part specially stipulated for women is equal, the part not stipulated is unequal. It can also be said that it is equal in general without special regulations.

Old man Kong Geng is highly valued, surrounded by reporters before and after the meeting, and government leaders also shook hands and talked with him in particular.

The entrance and exit of news reporters are extremely restricted. You enter the assembly hall through the side door and enter the venue through the main entrance. There is no slightest arbitrariness.

Before the afternoon meeting, the representatives changed their badges in the lounge. Because many of the original vermilion ones were lost, it was decided to change them to dark red. At the same time, new badges were issued with the number of the commemorative badge. They were circular, white, with the national flag on the upper half and the words "National Assembly (large characters) Representative (small characters)" in red on the lower half. The outer blue circle has a silver border, which is quite beautiful. Ma Shen Huilian said with a smile after wearing the new red badge: "It's like being a bride." Ma Chaojun said: "Okay, madam."

The afternoon meeting was chaired by Wu Tiecheng. Mr. Wu was tall, loud, and extraordinary in his demeanor. He had a stabilizing effect on the order of the meeting. He was comparable to Yu Bin in the morning and evening, but he also felt bad about the voting machine and the method of saying the electric button. "Those who agree, press this" and then gestured, "This, this voting machine." There was a burst of laughter from the audience and the lights next to the stage lit up.

He Yangling, a selected representative, said: "Some people casually call the colleagues who put forward opinions on the draft constitutional amendment the opposition, which is wrong. As far as I am concerned, I advocate that the advantages of the amendment should be retained and expanded, and the shortcomings should be removed or improved. I admit that I am a revisionist."

Chang Zonghui, a representative from the Anhui region, spoke like a "Sichuan storyteller," lengthening his voice, putting on a tone, and slowly performing, causing laughter and applause from the entire audience. Even he himself couldn't help but laugh, and everyone was happy.

Deng Jiayan, a selected representative, wearing black glasses, said as soon as he opened his mouth, "I neither oppose nor support the draft constitutional amendment." He also said: "Regarding the great use of the powers of examination and supervision, I have heard the founding father say in person that this is one of the greatest contributions to the political system in our country for thousands of years.

Mr. Zhang Puquan slowly walked to Cui Gaihua No. 517 at 5:20, sat in the empty seat of Yu Junxian No. 518, and talked quietly for a few words, seemingly concerned about her physical strength. The young people who saw this old couple in the side were deeply moved by the sweetness of their love, smiling and watching.

The meeting on the 30th was calm and uneventful all day. The representatives sat and rested, the reporters were equal to attending classes, and the staff were relatively relaxed. At the same time, the ventilation equipment in the venue was insufficient, it was warm but also very stuffy, everyone's faces were red, and people who had not slept well the night before felt a headache and yawned from time to time.

### Graduation Ceremony at the Central Police Academy: President Chiang Offers Earnest Admonition, Encouraging Officer Cadets to Shoulder the Important Task of National Reconstruction

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The third class of the Advanced Police Administration Research Program and the third class of the Police Administration Training Program of the Central Police Academy, having completed their training, held their graduation ceremony at the school outside Guanghua Gate at 10:00 AM on the 30th of this month.

At 9:40 AM, President Chiang, the chairman and school president, arrived at the school amidst his busy political affairs, accompanied by Director of Education Li Shizhen, and entered the ceremony platform to personally preside over the ceremony. The music played, and the ceremony proceeded as prescribed. The chairman and school president, recognizing that the graduating cadets were all middle and senior-level cadres in police construction, offered several points of earnest admonition: (1) The construction of a modern nation relies first on the stability of social order, and the establishment of good social order relies especially on police officers who have undergone the baptism of revolution to undertake police work at all levels, which will then be successful; (2) The transfer of demobilized military officers to police officers is of great significance. Having already sacrificed and struggled in the service of the military, completing the Northern Expedition and the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, everyone must use even stronger spirit and effort to shoulder the great task of national reconstruction afterward; (3) The nation must first build up its police force, and the work of building up the police force is extremely arduous. Since everyone has received strict military education, they are not only the backbone of the national army but also the backbone of police construction. It is hoped that everyone will use the training and experience they have received, using methods of leading troops, to train general police officers and constables, becoming new police cadres, and using this to organize the people, becoming good citizens. In this way, we can obtain good order and create a modern nation. It is hoped that everyone will work together to shoulder this important task… ” The admonition lasted about an hour, and all the officers and cadets in the audience were moved. This was followed by a speech by a representative of the graduating cadets, the ceremony was completed, and photographs were taken. At 11:30 AM, a group meal was held, during which Director of Education Li and Director Tang delivered speeches in succession, their words carrying great weight, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

American Newspaper Publishes Surprising News

[Associated Press, New York, 29th] Scripps-Howard newspaper today published news that armed smugglers are transporting large quantities of tungsten ore, which is essential for manufacturing military weapons, from the Chinese border to Soviet personnel in Hong Kong.

### Situation in the North After the Ceasefire: Interview with Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters: A Large-Scale Offensive by the Communist Army Is Unlikely

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, at the request of reporters, spoke freely about the situation in the North after the government announced the ceasefire order. He said: Judging by the overall strength of the Communist army, they may cause disturbances in the future, but a large-scale offensive will be impossible. Moreover, at a time when the government has declared a ceasefire and the National Assembly is in session, there is no reason for the National Army to launch an offensive. Therefore, the Communist propaganda that the National Army will attack Yan'an is nothing more than fear. As long as the Communist Party does not establish a government independently, the National Army will never attack Yan'an. However, it is unknown whether the Communist Party will take advantage of the National Army's ceasefire period to attack the National Army. Mr. Wang also said: The current priority of the National Army is to consolidate the security of the recovered areas and ensure transportation lines, that is, to focus on pacification work. He continued to explain the current situation in various provinces: (1) In Shandong, due to superior economic and transportation conditions, the Communist army will still be somewhat active, but it will be impossible to cut off the Jinpu Railway and attack the south corridor again. Their purpose of harassment is still defense, as they are unable to hold onto a single stronghold without retreating. Even if a stronghold is occasionally occupied, they must eventually withdraw. The waterway connection between Dalian and Yantai is also constantly under the surveillance of our navy and air force. (2) In Hebei, the Communist army retains considerable strength in the mountains west of Zhuozhou and Baoding on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, ranging from 180 miles to just over ten miles from the transportation lines. There are approximately 50,000 Communist troops between Zhuoxian and Shijiazhuang. Currently, Fangshunqiao and Yujiazhuang, south of Baoding, are not yet fully under our control. It is no longer possible for the Communist army to carry out large-scale destruction as before. (3) In Shanxi, the Communist army's continuous capture of strongholds in western Shanxi is out of fear of an attack on northern Shaanxi, and to maintain crossing points on the Yellow River and reinforce northern Shaanxi. In fact, Yonghe, Daning, and other places have no major military value, and the Communist army will not attack Yan'an. There will also be no major problems in Datong in northern Shanxi, and the Communist army's reinforcement in that direction is also intended to support northern Shaanxi. (4) In the province of Chahar, there are generally no problems. The Pingzhang Railway line can be maintained. Focus is on stabilizing the local area. There is still Communist army activity in northern Chahar, in Chifeng. The loss of Longguan is not a major problem.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Regarding the rumor that the Communist Party's headquarters may move from northern Shaanxi to the northeast, reporters inquired of two key figures in the northeast and the north. Their opinions were the same, believing that it was quite possible due to the Communist Party's fear of being attacked in northern Shaanxi and the superior economic and geographical conditions in the northeast. The key figure in the northeast also said: Before the Battle of Siping, the Communist Party had already made this preparation, but after the disastrous defeat in that battle, their plan was also frustrated.

### Wang Maogong Goes to Northern Jiangsu Yesterday to Guide Political Affairs and Comfort the People: Attends Welcome Reception in Shanghai and Reports on Provincial Affairs

[Report from This City] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Cheng Zimin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Bureau, passed through Shanghai last night to take the Jiangkang transport ship to Tongru area in northern Jiangsu to guide political affairs and comfort the people. Xu Mojia, Administrative Inspector and concurrently Security Commander of the Fourth District, recently completed his inspection of political affairs in Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, and Jingjiang counties and returned to Nantong on the same ship. Li Yunliang, manager of the Dada and Datong Shipping Companies joint operating office, Zhang Jingli, manager of the Dasheng Yarn Factory, and Zhu Zhenwei, deputy manager of the Shanghai Municipal Bank, held a cocktail reception at the Huitong Hotel on the Bund on Nanjing Road at 4:00 PM yesterday, inviting important figures from various circles in Nantong who were residing in Shanghai to welcome Chairman Wang and Commissioner Xu. During the reception, local leader Zhang Jingli first reported on the industrial, educational, and rehabilitation situation in northern Jiangsu. The Dasheng and other important industrial plants in Nantong have resumed work, and educational undertakings, from the textile, medical, and agricultural departments of Nantong College to the primary and secondary schools in the recovered areas, have resumed classes. He hoped that the government would assist in the salt reclamation business to develop the vast land of 14 million acres.

Next, Li Yunliang, a representative of the shipping industry, reported on the situation of water transportation in northern Jiangsu.

At this point, Chairman Wang Maogong, amidst applause, reported on the provincial government's measures over the past year and three months. Mr. Wang declared in a humble tone: The wounds inflicted on the people of Jiangsu by the enemy and puppets over the past eight years were originally hoped to be healed after victory, but because the Communist army occupies northern Jiangsu and other places, the people are still in deep water. He himself has been caring for the displaced, without rest, and various constructions for management, education, support, and health have not yet been developed, working diligently day and night. Now that order in northern Jiangsu is becoming more stable, all general and financial affairs should be coordinated with the pacification situation. Northern Jiangsu is the hometown of his youth, and the various sufferings of the people are constantly on his mind. Therefore, he has repeatedly visited the people to understand their hardships. This is the fifth time he has gone to observe the situation. Recently, he asked local gentry for valuable opinions on developing industry, expanding agriculture, maintaining transportation, restoring schools, and caring for the displaced, and he will sincerely accept them and follow the elders of Jiangsu to strengthen the promotion of the recovery of northern Jiangsu and even the entire province.

### The Difficulties of Overseas Chinese Economy

The Overseas Chinese Economic Conference, which has been on the verge of opening for more than 20 years, finally held an Overseas Chinese Economic Symposium in Beijing the day before yesterday, organized by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The five themes were approved in principle in an instant, and all the time was consumed by the overseas Chinese firing cannons and machine guns. Their every word reflected their inner anxiety and distress. Their cannons and machine guns, to put it kindly, were "complaining," and to put it bluntly, were "grumbling." They all slammed the table and shouted, every sentence was a word of indignation, every sentence was a word of blood and tears. In the tense emotions, they inevitably spoke bluntly and quickly, but the motive was very valuable.

Many problems are the same at home and abroad, and there are also many problems that only exist abroad and not at home, or that exist at home and not abroad. The anxiety and distress of the overseas Chinese are exactly the same as those of the people in China. They all feel like the entire Mount Tai is pressing on them, with a heart as heavy as lead, anxiously like ants on a hot pot, and depressed like a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis. The Overseas Chinese economy is a part of the national economy, closely related. We ask for the development of the Overseas Chinese economy, which is exactly what Minister Wang Yunwu said in three points: one is the recovery of the Overseas Chinese economy, the second is Overseas Chinese investment in China, and the third is the promotion of overseas markets.

When it comes to the recovery of the Overseas Chinese economy, the problem arises. As the overseas representative said, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission kowtowed to recover the masses, and the loan of US$50 million attracted the attention of the world, but a year later, the overseas Chinese did not receive a single cent of the loan. This kind of money does not need the country to subsidize the cost, that is, the overseas Chinese in the local area deposit in the Central and Jiaotong Banks, and the overseas Chinese transfer funds from foreign banks, lending to the overseas Chinese, and there is also interest that can be cheap. At present, what the overseas Chinese have obtained is only "verbal benefits." It is difficult for the overseas Chinese to travel to China, the Burmese representative spoke loudly, and the foreign currency brought back was sold to the government at the government rate. Now they are required to buy part of the foreign currency at a list price in order to return to their original place of residence, but they cannot get it. If people have not left, how can they recover?

For Overseas Chinese to invest in China, it is first necessary to protect the existing Overseas Chinese property in China to make them feel at ease, but the fact is the opposite. Wen Jupeng, an old revolutionary comrade of the Dutch East Indies delegation, said in tears that his seven houses in Four Lanes in Nanjing were occupied by related persons and would not be returned. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent a commissioner with official documents to say good things and beg everywhere, and all parties pushed back and forth, and pushed it completely clean, and it has not been recovered for a year. Huang Boyao, a representative of the United States, found in a survey in Guangdong that Overseas Chinese property was also mostly occupied. Shen Lingqiao, a leader of the Overseas Chinese in Xiangshan, said that he had just come from the countryside in Guangdong, where there were as many bandits as cattle, running rampant in broad daylight, corrupt officials were walking the streets, and dirty officials were as many as dogs, which made people shudder. How can he muster up the courage to invest in the motherland?

To drink milk, you must first raise good cows, but now hoping that Overseas Chinese will return to invest in the motherland, the Overseas Chinese themselves have become destitute, and those who are not poor are also bound by the government of residence, and the funds are also not flexible and difficult to flow into the motherland. Lin Tingcheng, the former consul in Batavia, frankly told the suffering of the Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, which he had personally witnessed. The Indonesian government converted the stacks of Japanese tickets in the hands of the Overseas Chinese into 2 Indonesian currency per 100 yuan. When exchanging, they must be deposited in the bank, limiting the withdrawal to 100 yuan per month. The Dutch East Indies government allowed the Overseas Chinese to return to China, only allowing them to bring 300 guilders. The travel expenses and living expenses are already stretched, so how can there be money to invest! The same is true in Vietnam. When Overseas Chinese return to China, each person is only allowed to bring 200 Vietnamese currency, which is worth only a dozen Hong Kong dollars at the market price after conversion in Hong Kong, which is not enough for luggage handling fees, not to mention accommodation and food expenses and return travel expenses during the stay.

Everyone in the country is worried about the imminent great depression, business is sluggish, production is stagnant, purchasing power is weak, and high interest rates are suffocating. If you want to cure the root cause, the first thing is political unification, and the second is the stability of the currency value. However, in times of war, neither of these two paths can be achieved overnight. The way to promote lending within the possible scope today is to promote lending in the countryside and overseas. In the countryside in China, because of high wages, expensive costs, and cheap grain prices, and in the state of war, the countryside is the first victim, and farmers are struggling on the hunger line, and have long lost their purchasing power, so only overseas is the lifeline of the country's economy today. The largest market for Chinese goods overseas is of course Southeast Asia. The economic activities of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia include investment and management, labor in mines and factories, etc., and thirdly, sales. They are the "centralized sales" of local products in Southeast Asia and the "domestic distribution" of imports. The former is better done by whites and is very advanced, and the latter was initially realized by Overseas Chinese. However, in the years before the war, the Japanese had taken the place of the Overseas Chinese and replaced them by distributing goods to the natives. The Overseas Chinese have been in a precarious situation. Today, the Japanese have been driven away, which is a great opportunity for the Overseas Chinese. They can transport Chinese goods to foreign countries and sell them to the natives, and at the same time sell them to the Overseas Chinese themselves. The amount will surely be amazing.

Tea, medicinal materials, seafood, groceries, ceramics, etc. produced in China are generally regarded as non-essential goods in some places of residence, and foreign exchange is not allowed. Therefore, Chinese goods in overseas markets are naturally extinct, even if they are not said to be extinct. For example, in Vietnam, which claims to be friendly to China, for goods that Overseas Chinese have obtained foreign exchange; the Chinese economic bureau can levy taxes by converting the public price of Hong Kong dollars into Vietnamese currency, and the Overseas Chinese have only one way to die.

The Overseas Chinese economy has been attacked from both inside and outside, and it is truly difficult. There is a saying in Chinese: "If you cut down a tree without cutting its roots, it will be reborn; if you block water without blocking its source, it will flow again; if you eliminate disaster without eliminating its root, it will be chaotic again." Today, the way to relieve the situation is only one sentence: Please wake up all Chinese people from beginning to end and stop the civil war! Then diplomacy can be tough, the country can be stable, and the Overseas Chinese economy will have a way out.

### An Impartial Discussion of the Vendor Problem

Yesterday, over a thousand family members of street vendors in this city suddenly surrounded the Huangpu Police Department, demanding the release of recently detained vendors, causing a temporary disruption of order. Fortunately, the branch director accepted the family's demands and agreed to release the arrested vendors in succession, gradually restoring order. Unexpectedly, the gathered crowd continued to cause disturbances at the Lao Zha Police Department, and there were incidents of destroying shops, causing the situation to become serious. The matter has now calmed down, and we cannot help but make some brief comments.

First of all, we must say that while rectifying the city's appearance is indeed important, it should not affect the livelihoods of ordinary people due to the crackdown on vendors. This newspaper has repeatedly written articles urging the authorities to pay more attention to proactive measures and less to passive crackdowns regarding current municipal facilities. Vendors who obstruct traffic should indeed be banned, but those who may not necessarily obstruct public transportation should be treated leniently. In the post-war period, the people's livelihood is declining, so we should open up avenues for the people to make a living and not increase unemployment in order to maintain social order. Those who are detained for executing the order to ban vendors should be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the law. We sympathize with the vendors' petition this time, feeling the difficulty of people making a living. However, if public order is disrupted due to the petition, it will lose general sympathy. For the police authorities, banning vendors is originally the execution of orders, which is their duty and cannot be shirked. However, in the process of execution, they should be cautious, and in the face of激昂群情, they should deal with it calmly, so as not to lead to a major change.

However, yesterday's disturbances, although caused by the petition of the vendors' families, later went beyond the scope of the petition and involved the destruction of shops. Such disruptive behavior cannot gain the sympathy of the world. Shanghai is the foremost city in our country, and how to maintain public order in Shanghai is the duty of the government. However, every citizen has the responsibility to assist in maintaining order and cannot completely push this responsibility onto the government. Because of yesterday's disturbances, we hope that every citizen will take on this responsibility. At the same time, we urge the government to seize the opportunity and pay more attention to stabilizing people's livelihoods.

### Rescuing Hostages and Extorting Huge Sums - District Chief Liao Zongfu Ruins Achievements in Suppressing Bandits - Interrogation Reveals Conclusive Evidence, to Be Brought to Justice

[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 30th] Liao Zongfu, the district chief of Chenmu District in Su County's 11th District, led his troops to encircle and suppress Li Defu on October 12, rescuing four hostages, including Sun Dechang, the town chief of Yangxiang Town in Kunshan County. He then had a whimsical idea, demanding from Sun et al. a reward of 15 million yuan worth of cotton uniforms and over 5 million yuan in cash. At that time, Sun was unable to afford it, so he submitted a request to the paratrooper unit stationed there, asking the Paratrooper Headquarters for instructions on whether he could raise this amount locally. Commander Ma Shigong of the paratrooper unit here was furious after reading it and immediately ordered Chief of Staff Colonel Liu Nongjun to summon all relevant parties for interrogation, which took place five times. In addition to Liao Zongfu's personal confession of demanding 100 sets of cotton uniforms as rewards for the self-defense teams in Su and Dan counties, Pan Shengqiu, the town chief of Chenmu Town, also provided detailed testimony on the spot. At the same time, the Paratrooper Headquarters also discovered that Liao Zongfu had secretly hidden four confiscated short guns without reporting them. Ma considered that the district chief was greedy for merit and profit, resembling Li Defu the second, and was suspected of embezzlement. The case was serious, and if he was not brought to justice, it would be impossible to refresh social perception. Therefore, on the 30th, he ordered Su County Magistrate Lu Jianhua to strictly guard Liao Zongfu and telegraphed the Wuxi Command Post to request instructions for handling the matter.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 30th] Jiang Renjie, a senior advisor to the Taihu Bandit Suppression Command, recently received our reporter and made the following remarks on the process of the command's bandit suppression work: The command's bandit suppression work can be divided into two stages so far: the first stage was the pacification period, focusing on pacification matters on the surface. Specifically, for example, the bandit groups of Liao Bingnan, Ruan Yingjie, Hu Zhongying, Cai Haogong, Zhu Wenxiao, etc., have all been pacified and returned to allegiance. The second stage is the fundamental governance period, focusing on improving the Baojia system and strengthening local self-defense forces. The work in this stage has now been completed. In order to deeply understand the actual situation of each subordinate county, the command will send Deputy Commander Liu Hongde to lead staff, combat, and intelligence personnel to inspect Suzhou, Wujiang, Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing, Wuxing, and Changxing counties. The significance of this inspection is twofold: (1) to assess whether the Baojia system of each county is sound and whether the self-defense forces are strong; (2) because the establishment of pacification commissioners has been ordered to be withdrawn at the end of November, and there are still scattered bandits wandering in each county, the command will assess the geographical environment of each county, judge the situation, and plan to launch a thorough cleanup operation. The reporter then asked if there was indeed a third phase of the bandit suppression plan to be implemented. He replied: Although there is no clear order yet, it is quite possible, and the command has not received any news of its termination.

On the 27th of last month, he convened a meeting of all township and Baojia heads in the first district to review the situation. Over 700 township and Baojia heads attended. First, the commander gave a speech, explaining that the township and Baojia heads should earnestly take responsibility and make every effort to prevent and suppress bandits, so as to eliminate them as soon as possible. He also established a three-chapter covenant: (1) Those who know about bandits but do not report, collude with bandits, harbor bandits, or compromise with bandits will be executed on the spot; (2) Those who are corrupt, leading to the oppression of good people into becoming bandits, will be executed on the spot; (3) Those who are currently serving as township and Baojia heads and who have served as enemy, puppet, or bandit township and Baojia heads in the past will be allowed to repent and reform. If they still cling to their past practices and remain unrepentant, they will be executed on the spot.

### Newly Appointed Zhejiang Inspector Zhu Zongliang Takes Office

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 30th] The newly appointed acting Zhejiang Inspector Zhu Zongliang, who used to be the editor of the local news section of the Shanghai Business Daily, met with our reporter alone in his capacity as a reporter on the 30th, and they had a very pleasant conversation. Zhu believes that there is still a difficult period ahead after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. During this difficult period, civil servants should have the motto of "worrying about the world before the world worries." Therefore, civil servants should absolutely not engage in business, so as to avoid blurring the lines between officials and merchants and competing with the people for profit. Bureaucratic capitalism should never exist. Zhu is scheduled to take office one day and, after internal arrangements, will spend one-third of his time each year inspecting the counties. Furthermore, Chen Songping, the chief secretary who originally acted as the inspector, will hand over his duties one day and return to Shanghai on the 2nd. He will stay in Shanghai for a while and devote himself to cultural undertakings.

### Wuxi Deed Tax Reduced

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The county's Real Estate Evaluation Committee previously set the highest land price at 16 million yuan per mu. The Deed Tax Office was ordered to change it to 50 million yuan, causing those who paid taxes to be very hesitant. There was also much criticism in public opinion.

### Xiaotiao Business in Pinghu, Silver Shops Also Becoming Unstable

[Our Pinghu Dispatch] Recently, the business in this county has been sluggish and has entered a severe stage. Major merchants all feel that the market is depressed and cannot be maintained.

The silver shop industry, which has been uniquely blessed in recent years, has fortunately been able to remain silent. Unexpectedly, on the 27th, the Yuanxingxiang Silver Shop in this county suddenly announced its liquidation and reorganization. The economic crisis is becoming more obvious. (Photo by He Xianglin)

Magistrate Hu approved the police bureau to investigate. The villagers believed that their goal had been achieved and returned to their township in the afternoon.

### Northern Jiangsu Highway Bridges Undergoing Active Repair

[Our Yangzhou Dispatch] During the military period, the highway bridges in various parts of northern Jiangsu were severely damaged. Although the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau had previously formulated a plan to rush repairs, it was unable to start work extensively due to financial constraints.

Materials are currently being prepared, and it is expected that they can be completed by the end of January 1947. As for other bridges that urgently need to be repaired, the Jiangsu Provincial Government is raising large sums of money and actively repairing them.

### Local News Briefs

Ningbo News: Yu Jimin, the commissioner of the 6th Administrative Region of Zhejiang Province, was initially the head of Ningbo police affairs, then the head of Yin County, and then promoted to commissioner, for a total of 16 years. At the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 26th of last month, he was transferred to a member of the Shandong Provincial Government. All sectors of Ningbo telegraphed Chairman Shen, requesting the Central Government to earnestly retain him.

Qingpu News: Usury is prevalent in this county. The Qingpu branch of the Provincial Agricultural Bank, in order to save rural finance, specially launched agricultural storage and loan services, surveying warehouses. All agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and rapeseed can be stored and mortgaged at a monthly interest rate of 0.9%, which is several times lower than usury.

Chongming News: The stone dikes connecting the ferry terminal in this county to the shore have been in disrepair for many years. In addition, last autumn, the ferry terminal workers placed a floating mine that they had dredged up on the dikes, causing a violent explosion and severe damage. The people of the township are now actively trying to repair it to prevent accidents.

Liuhe News: The Journalists Association of this county was established on the 26th of last month. Gaoyou News: Since the restoration of this county, all levels of institutions have been restored in order. However, the health institute has repeatedly written to the Suyu Branch for relief due to limited equipment and financial difficulties. Approval has now been granted.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: According to Mr. Li Zijun, manager of Ningbo Yongfeng Money Shop, who claims to be the party concerned: I read the news in the foreign news column of the Shen Bao on November 29, "All illegal money shops in Ningbo will be closed by the end of the year, totaling 71 including Yuda, etc." The name Yongfeng was listed in the news as an unapproved money shop, which is inconsistent with the facts. This shop has been approved for resumption of business by the Ministry of Finance, Jingqian No. 1087. I believe that the rumors are inaccurate. I have entrusted your lawyer to write a letter for correction, etc. Accordingly, I am writing to your newspaper to investigate and hope that you will publish it in the Letter to the Editor column to clarify the facts. Lawyer Ding Qiming of the Shen Bao

### Health Bureau Responds to Crackdown on Coffins

Regarding the city's crackdown on coffins, various parties have repeatedly expressed their opinions in this newspaper. The letter submitted by reader Tao Ansheng, after being forwarded to the Health Bureau by this newspaper, has been answered as follows: (1) The bureau has long planned to requisition land to open up gravesites, but the number of accumulated coffins has reached more than 100,000. According to 100 graves per mu, more than 1,000 mu of land are required, and land compensation will cost at least 200 million yuan. Such a large area and such a huge sum of money make it difficult to requisition at one time. (2) Accumulated coffins can be divided into those with owners and those without owners. For coffins with owners, there is a monthly fee for coffins stored in the funeral home. The purpose of this storage is to transport them back to their place of origin for burial. Now that transportation is gradually recovering, the work of transporting coffins is actively strengthened. Is it not a one-time solution to use the monthly storage fee for transporting coffins? (3) The so-called "burial for peace" means that the body should be properly disposed of and should not be left for a long time. Cremation is originally a good method for disposing of corpses, but unfortunately this custom has not yet become widespread in our country. Those who are children are reluctant to cremate the bodies of their relatives, but how can they be at peace with letting them lie in the funeral home for years, exposed to wind and rain, and gnawed by rats and insects? If a time limit is not set and people are allowed to continue to bury them at will, who will be responsible for the epidemic that will rage in May and June next year?" It is specially published to answer Mr. Tao and to ask all families with stored coffins to pay attention.

### Regarding Three Student Answer Matters

(1) Reply to Mr. Weng Shunfu:

1. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau does not have the transcript of the East Asia Institute of Technology established by the enemy.

2. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has agreed to hold the third qualification review next month (December). Although you have lost your transcript, you can still participate in the review if two or more of the original presidents or teachers of the East Asia Institute of Technology provide proof.

3. Before you pass the qualification review, you cannot apply for the second semester of the third year of public or private high schools. You can only participate in the entrance examination for the first semester of the first year of high school with equivalent academic qualifications.

(2) Reply to Hong Baoche and others:

1. Although graduates of unregistered middle schools have been admitted to universities and continue to study, their student status is still a problem.

2. Diplomas from unregistered middle schools cannot be regarded as proof of equivalent academic qualifications.

3. Since you are graduates of a certain unregistered middle school in North China, you should apply to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for qualification review in accordance with regulations. You should also inquire directly to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education whether it will hold another qualification examination.

4. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has agreed to hold the third qualification review next month (December). At that time, you can bring your documents to the bureau for consultation.

5. Those who have been admitted to universities should still undergo qualification review, but those who were admitted before February 1946 can be given "qualification review without examination."

(3) Reply to Mr. Shen Yiqiu:

The qualification review of students from enemy and puppet colleges and universities is handled entirely by the Qualification Review Committee for Students from Enemy and Puppet Colleges and Universities established by the Ministry of Education. The committee's office is now located at National Jinan University at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Albert in Shanghai. You should go there to inquire about everything.

聯總援華物資　一部份不適用　　英議員指摘美商家
Some UN Relief Supplies for China Are Unsuitable; British MP Accuses American Businesses

〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕英下院本日開會，討論聯總之救濟工作，由工黨議員威廉士發言稱：聯總所擬接濟中國之大批物資，均未能運抵中國，且輸往中國之若干物資並不實用。若干美國商業公司，有極大嫌疑，即若輩曾將美國所不需之聯總救濟物資，以廉價傾銷於中國市塲。例如最近有婦女備用之腰帶一批運往中國，此等腰帶對紐約之太太小姐或能發生救濟效用，但對中國農婦則毫無任何用途。
(Agence France-Presse, London, 29th) The British House of Commons met today to discuss the relief work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Labor MP Williams stated that a large amount of supplies that UNRRA planned to provide to China had not been shipped to China, and some of the supplies shipped to China were not practical. Several American commercial companies are highly suspected of dumping UNRRA relief supplies that were not needed in the United States into the Chinese market at low prices. For example, a batch of women's spare belts was recently shipped to China. These belts may have a relief effect on ladies in New York, but they are of no use to Chinese farmers.

印政府改組經過（下）  本報駐印記者周祥光
The Reorganization of the Indian Government (Part 2)  Our Newspaper Correspondent in India, Zhou Xiangguang

迄十月廿五日晚上十點鐘，始由總督作最後決定，廿六日晨，遂正式公布。綜計此次新政府改組後，計包括印度敎徒閣員四人，回敎聯盟四人，賤民階級二人，回敎國家主義者一人，錫克敎一人，拜火敎一人，及印度基督敎一人。其人數與所祖任各部姓名如下：（一）外務部卡尼赫魯，（二）內政部長巴台爾，（三）文敎部長拉却基，（四）糧農部長柏魯沙，（以上屬印度敎徒）（五）勞工部長羅糜，（六）立法部長孟德爾，（以上屬賤民階級）（七）財政部長李嘉德，（八）商業部長龔特里，（九）郵航部長尼評塔，（十）衛生部長可汗，（以上屬回敎徒）（十一）國防部長辛格，（錫克族領袖）（十二）供應部長梅德，（基督敎）、（十三）工鑛部長鮑甫（拜火敎）（十四）鐵道部長亞里，（回敎民族主義者）
The final decision was made by the Governor-General at 10 PM on October 25th, and the official announcement was made on the morning of the 26th. In summary, after this reorganization of the new government, it includes four Hindu cabinet members, four Muslim League members, two members of the Scheduled Castes, one Muslim nationalist, one Sikh, one Zoroastrian, and one Indian Christian. The number of people and the names of the departments they lead are as follows: (1) External Affairs Minister, Nehru; (2) Home Affairs Minister, Patel; (3) Education Minister, Rajagopalachari; (4) Food and Agriculture Minister, Prasad (all of the above are Hindus); (5) Labor Minister, Ram; (6) Law Minister, Mandal (both of the above are from the Scheduled Castes); (7) Finance Minister, Liaquat; (8) Commerce Minister, Ghazanfar; (9) Posts and Aviation Minister, Nishtar; (10) Health Minister, Khan (all of the above are Muslims); (11) Defence Minister, Singh (Sikh leader); (12) Supply Minister, Matthai (Christian); (13) Industries and Mines Minister, Bhabha (Parsi); (14) Railways Minister, Ali (Muslim nationalist).

綜觀上列名單，內政外交兩部操於國大黨手中，而財政商業則屬諸回盟方面；而回盟新任閣員於廿六晨赴總督府宣誓就職前，乃往眞納公館聆聽訓詞。査財長李嘉德原爲回盟執會秘書長，當眞納昔日領導十二名回敎議員於中央立法會議時，渠即追隨在旁，迄今數十年矣，故眞納特以渠爲回盟在新政府中之領袖，非無故也。
Looking at the above list, the Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs ministries are controlled by the Congress Party, while Finance and Commerce belong to the Muslim League. Before the new Muslim League cabinet members went to the Governor-General's residence on the morning of the 26th to be sworn in, they went to Jinnah's residence to listen to instructions. Finance Minister Liaquat was originally the Secretary-General of the Muslim League Executive Committee. When Jinnah led twelve Muslim members of the Central Legislative Assembly in the past, he followed him closely. It has been several decades since then, so it is not without reason that Jinnah specifically appointed him as the leader of the Muslim League in the new government.

十月廿六日上午，財長李嘉德在記者招待會中說明同盟政策，其要點如下：（一）回盟此番入閣，願與他人共同合作，和平相處，惟目前印度尙無自己之憲法，即屬於英人所製之一九三五年法律之下，故無集體負責或某人爲政府中領袖可言。（二）回盟自希望印度能獲得完全自由獨立，並爲印回兩民族權益而奮鬥；但回盟並不因此而放棄巴基斯坦之主張。（三）財政計劃並不使富者愈富，窮者愈窮，但使富者不能再富，窮者逐漸富之。因回盟自稱，在內閣中，各黨有其自己領袖，不承認尼赫魯爲政府中之領袖，並以集體負責乃憲法名詞，印度旣無憲法，故無集體負責可言；即內閣中各部自行其事，不過共時和平相處耳。
On the morning of October 26th, Finance Minister Liaquat explained the policies of the League at a press conference. The main points are as follows: (1) The Muslim League is willing to cooperate with others and live in peace this time it joins the cabinet, but India does not yet have its own constitution and belongs to the 1935 law made by the British, so there is no collective responsibility or someone who can be said to be the leader in the government. (2) The Muslim League hopes that India can achieve complete freedom and independence and strives for the rights and interests of both the Indian and Muslim peoples; however, the Muslim League does not give up its claim to Pakistan because of this. (3) The financial plan does not make the rich richer and the poor poorer, but makes the rich unable to get richer and the poor gradually become rich. Because the Muslim League claims that in the cabinet, each party has its own leader and does not recognize Nehru as the leader in the government, and collective responsibility is a constitutional term. Since India has no constitution, there is no collective responsibility; that is, the various departments in the cabinet do their own things, but they coexist peacefully at the same time.

職是之故，此次回盟參政以後，已使印度政治造成新的局勢，對國大黨之爭取自由獨立，頗有影響。過去國大黨出組新政府，總督祇是掛名首長而已，現回盟入閣，旣不贊成集體負責，又不承認誰是新政府中之領袖，則必須依照一九三五年法之規定，照印度政府組織條例，則臨時中央政府，依然是總督行政會議，使內閣地位，無形消减。國大黨一向主張共同集體負責，現旣不可能，則唯有承認此一原則。然我等第三者認爲印回兩族此次能參加政府，終爲好現象。縱使各項問題，未能達到協議，相信能設法在內閣會議席上，討論一切問題。雙方或有異見，權益或有衝突，但終須設法調整，雙方如有善意，必能逹到此項目的。如能做到此點，則可開創協商解決問題之習慣，使各集團漸趨諒解，對於主要問題，自能有愉快解決，則自由獨立之日離此不遠矣。
For this reason, the Muslim League's participation in politics this time has created a new situation in Indian politics and has had a considerable impact on the Congress Party's struggle for freedom and independence. In the past, when the Congress Party formed a new government, the Governor-General was only a nominal leader. Now that the Muslim League has joined the cabinet, since it does not agree with collective responsibility and does not recognize who is the leader in the new government, it must follow the provisions of the 1935 law. According to the regulations on the organization of the Indian government, the temporary central government is still the Governor-General's Executive Council, which invisibly reduces the status of the cabinet. The Congress Party has always advocated joint and collective responsibility, and now that it is impossible, it can only recognize this principle. However, we third parties believe that it is ultimately a good phenomenon that the Indian and Muslim ethnic groups can participate in the government this time. Even if agreements cannot be reached on all issues, it is believed that ways can be found to discuss all issues in the cabinet meeting. The two sides may have differences or conflicts of interest, but they must eventually find ways to adjust. If both sides have good intentions, they will surely achieve this goal. If this can be done, a habit of consultation and problem-solving can be created, so that various groups will gradually move towards understanding. For major issues, there will naturally be pleasant solutions, and the day of freedom and independence is not far away.

最後，尙待說明者，爲印回兩教有其不同的語言，文字，風俗，習慣，文化等，故彼此獲得一致的見解頗屬不易。國大黨方面，以國土爲立塲，希望印度統一，土地不可分割；而回盟則以民族爲立塲，希望自己民族獨立，不受他民族統治。出發點旣不同，所用方法亦異。吾人今日看印度政局演變，必明乎此，方能瞭然其根本原因所在。
Finally, what remains to be explained is that the Indian and Muslim religions have different languages, scripts, customs, habits, cultures, etc., so it is quite difficult for each other to reach a consensus. The Congress Party takes the territory as its standpoint, hoping that India will be unified and that the land will not be divided; while the Muslim League takes the nation as its standpoint, hoping that its own nation will be independent and not ruled by other nations. Since the starting points are different, the methods used are also different. When we look at the evolution of the Indian political situation today, we must understand this in order to understand the root cause.

Detention of Street Vendors Causes a Great Disturbance; Chaos All Day, Traffic Disrupted, More Than a Dozen People Shot; Councilors and Journalists Beaten and Humiliated at Huangpu Police Station

〔本報訊〕警察局自奉命取締攤販後，黄浦老閘二分局，連日拘捕攤販七百餘人，黄浦分局拘押者約三百餘人，大多均已拘押歡日。昨晨因攤販家屬，紛紛要求送進食物，警局因人數過多，予以拒絕，遂生事故。在羣情情激下，星星之火，乃釀成不可收拾之勢，警察並曾朝天開槍，致流彈受傷者達十餘人。傍晚，羣衆行動漸見越軌，散布傳單，並搗毁沿途各大公司櫥窗，損失極巨。警局至深晚止，已逮捕有煽動嫌疑者百餘人。
[Our Newspaper] Since the police station was ordered to ban street vendors, the second branch of the Huangpu and Old Zhabei Precincts has arrested more than 700 street vendors in recent days, and the Huangpu Precinct has detained more than 300 people, most of whom have been detained for days. Yesterday morning, because the families of the street vendors demanded food be sent in, the police station refused due to the large number of people, which caused an accident. Under the emotional excitement of the crowd, a small spark turned into an uncontrollable situation. The police even fired shots into the sky, causing more than a dozen people to be injured by stray bullets. In the evening, the actions of the crowd gradually became more out of line, distributing leaflets and destroying the display windows of major companies along the way, resulting in huge losses. By late at night, the police station had arrested more than 100 people suspected of incitement.

昨晨八時許，黄浦分局內，被拘留三百餘攤販之家屬，紛紛要求送進食物，若干家屬並堅不肯去，必欲將此　攤販釋放。人數旣多，秩序紊亂，該分局則將彼等驅出，並令預備隊出動彈壓，各攤販家屬亦即散去。至午前十一時許，該分局奉命將拘押在內之攤販分批陸續釋放，形熱遂見緩和。不意午後十二時四十五分左右，羣衆忽又　聚，交通阻塞，情形又趨混亂。警局遂再命騎巡隊出動驅散，不意羣衆散而復聚，人數更多，請求釋放尙在拘押之攤販。詎該局警士並不向羣衆作攤販業已全部放出之解釋，而將所有圍觀之羣衆，悉作滋事之徒看待，亂加毆打，新聞記者亦不得免，被毆受傷。於是羣衆愈聚愈多，睹狀益憤通。相持至下午四時，因警察開槍强壓，附近商店，見情形嚴重，相率閉門。時黄浦分局召來救火車三輛，即將龍頭開放，企圖驅散羣衆，法商電車全部停駛，自外灘至八仙橋，首尾銜接不斷。是時情形堅張，成混亂狀態。
At about 8:00 yesterday morning, the families of more than 300 street vendors detained in the Huangpu Precinct demanded that food be sent in. Some families insisted on staying, determined to release the street vendors. Because there were so many people and the order was chaotic, the precinct drove them out and ordered the reserve team to suppress them, and the families of the street vendors dispersed. At about 11:00 am, the precinct was ordered to release the detained street vendors in batches, and the situation gradually eased. Unexpectedly, at around 12:45 pm, the crowd suddenly gathered again, traffic was blocked, and the situation became chaotic again. The police station then ordered the mounted patrol team to disperse them again. Unexpectedly, the crowd dispersed and gathered again, with more people, requesting the release of the street vendors still in custody. Unexpectedly, the police officers of the station did not explain to the crowd that all the street vendors had been released, but treated all the onlookers as troublemakers, beating them indiscriminately, and even journalists were not spared and were beaten and injured. As a result, more and more people gathered, and they became more and more angry at the sight. The standoff lasted until 4:00 pm. Because the police fired shots to suppress the crowd, nearby shops closed their doors one after another, seeing the seriousness of the situation. At that time, the Huangpu Precinct called three fire trucks and opened the fire hoses to try to disperse the crowd. All French-owned trams were stopped, stretching continuously from the Bund to the Eight Immortals Bridge. The situation was tense at this time, becoming a chaotic state.

是時市參議會代表王先靑，唐世昌，朱文德三議員，亦已趕到調解，請杜局長發全禁止警察對羣衆採取無禮行動？應盡力勸導，但當時秩序混亂，竟無能爲力，王先靑氏且受警察侮辱。五時許，市長亦至，圳與黄浦分局杜醉分局長會商，並將羣衆中已被該局逮捕者四十餘人，山市長親自訊問後，予以釋放。
At that time, representatives of the Municipal Council, councilors Wang Xianqing, Tang Shichang, and Zhu Wende, also rushed to mediate, asking Director Du to issue a full ban on the police taking rude actions against the crowd? They should try their best to persuade, but at that time the order was chaotic and they could do nothing. Mr. Wang Xianqing was even insulted by the police. At about 5:00, the mayor also arrived and consulted with Du Zui, the director of the Huangpu Precinct, and released more than 40 people who had been arrested by the bureau from the crowd after the mountain mayor personally interrogated them.

但據黄浦分局方面稱，是時該局對門之長沙商棧樓上，有人開槍，故該局警察，亦即開槍示威，五分鐘後，市長遂偕被困之各報記者離去。其後該局又捕獲行跡可疑者六十餘人。
However, according to the Huangpu Precinct, at that time someone fired a gun from the building of the Changsha Merchants' Stockade opposite the precinct, so the police of the precinct also fired shots to demonstrate. Five minutes later, the mayor left with the reporters from various newspapers who were trapped. After that, the precinct arrested more than 60 people with suspicious behavior.

沿途搗毀商店
Shops Destroyed Along the Way

下午六時，情形益緊，羣衆中似有有組織之行動，一部份羣衆阻止汽車行駛，有二人且倒臥於本報記者車前，阻止行駛者。時羣衆行動更見越軌，竟搗毀沿途公司商店櫥窗廿三處之多。中正東路，北海路，西藏路，浙江路，南京路，福州路等處商店，如紅棉酒家，大新公司，永安公司七重天，新新公司，老閘戲院，金城大戲院，新光大戲院，浙江大戲院，大春樓，履華鞋店，大中央皮鞋店，中央舞廳，廣西路一六四號，二二四號，山西路二一五號，爵祿飯店，國際大戲院，米高美舞廳，國泰越劇塲，新利査西菜社，東方食品公司，大光明眼鏡公司等，皆受破壞，估計損失不下數十億之巨。
At 6:00 pm, the situation became even more tense. There seemed to be organized actions among the crowd. A portion of the crowd prevented cars from driving, and two people even lay down in front of our reporter's car, preventing it from driving. At that time, the crowd's actions became even more out of line, destroying the display windows of as many as 23 companies and shops along the way. Shops on East Zhongzheng Road, North Hai Road, Tibet Road, Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Fuzhou Road, etc., such as Hongmian Restaurant, Great New Company, Wing On Company's Seventh Heaven, New New Company, Old Zhabei Theater, Jincheng Grand Theater, Xinguang Grand Theater, Zhejiang Grand Theater, Dachunlou, Lihua Shoe Store, Great Central Shoe Store, Central Ballroom, No. 164 Guangxi Road, No. 224, No. 215 Shanxi Road, Jue Lu Hotel, International Grand Theater, MGM Ballroom, Cathay Yue Opera House, New Rich Western Restaurant, Oriental Food Company, Daguangming Optical Company, etc., were all damaged, with estimated losses of no less than several billion.

下午七時，警察局副局長兪叔平氏趕到，時槍聲未止，車輛全停。自中正東路至北京路，東西交通全部斷絕。時警察在混亂中亦有被拋洋瓶磚石致傷者。
At 7:00 pm, Deputy Director Yu Shuping of the Police Department rushed to the scene. At that time, the gunfire had not stopped, and all vehicles were stopped. Traffic was completely cut off from east to west from East Zhongzheng Road to Beijing Road. At that time, some policemen were also injured by thrown glass bottles and bricks in the chaos.

老閘分局，所押攤販實較黄浦分局爲多，但因對送入食物之家屬，妥爲維持秩序，各家屬皆得列隊進入，故未生事端。其後因見羣衆搗毁該局轄境內之商店，遂亦出動維持秩序，並曾逮捕行跡可疑者三十餘人，搜出木棍鉛粉筆等物。
The Old Zhabei Precinct actually detained more street vendors than the Huangpu Precinct, but because the families who sent in food were properly maintained in order, all families were able to enter in line, so no incidents occurred. Later, seeing the crowd destroying shops within the jurisdiction of the bureau, they also dispatched to maintain order, and arrested more than 30 people with suspicious behavior, and found wooden sticks, lead powder pencils, etc.

據警局人員稱，紛亂時該局曾派員雜於州人業，密切注意，當時即曾發現有不似攤販者數人，從中指揮，羣衆感情衝動，遂皆隨聲附和，局勢遂益見嚴重。
According to police officers, during the chaos, the bureau sent personnel mixed in with the people to pay close attention. At that time, they discovered several people who did not look like street vendors directing from the middle. The crowd's emotions were impulsive, so they all echoed, and the situation became more and more serious.

鄭家木橋火光
Fire at Zhengjia Wood Bridge

又五時許槍聲緊密時，若干羣衆，曾奔至鄭家木橋口高生大紙號門口暫避，不意該號樓上忽有沸水下傾，羣衆乃益憤激，即將該號存紙全部拖至馬路，加以焚毁，該號所備之三輪車及自由車各一輛，亦爲彼等焚燒。至晚九時許，沿途雖尙有軍警警戒，秧序已漸恢復，惟高生大紙號前餘燼尙未全熄而已
Also, when the gunshots were tight at about 5:00, some of the crowd ran to the entrance of the Gao Sheng Da Paper Store at the mouth of Zhengjia Wood Bridge to take temporary shelter. Unexpectedly, boiling water suddenly poured down from the building of the store, and the crowd became even more angry. They dragged all the stored paper of the store to the road and burned it. The store's three-wheeled cart and bicycle were also burned by them. By about 9:00 pm, although there were still military and police guards along the way, the order had gradually been restored, but the embers in front of the Gao Sheng Da Paper Store had not been completely extinguished.

### Fierce Verbal Battle in the UN Political Committee; US Clarifies Stance on Disarmament; Hopes for Early Establishment of Atomic Energy Control Agreement; Various Committees Intensify Work, UN General Assembly May Conclude Within Two Weeks

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th (Broadcast) - US Representative Connally delivered a speech yesterday at the UN Political and Security Committee, stating that the hope for resolving the international management of atomic energy is no longer distant. Connally stated that merely managing atomic energy cannot guarantee the implementation of disarmament, and the world must take effective action to reduce other armaments.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper's New York Correspondent, 30th] Regarding the issue of disarmament, the United Nations has once again encountered great difficulties. The Soviet Union has formally notified the United Nations that the Soviet side will never relinquish its veto power when discussing disarmament or the management of atomic energy. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States have also formally declared to the United Nations their firm opposition to any single nation using its single vote to undermine the international management of disarmament.

[United Press, Lake Success, 29th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky stated today at the Political Committee meeting, insisting that the destruction of atomic bombs be the first step towards universal disarmament among all nations, while also insisting on retaining the right to exercise veto power over any decisions regarding international control and supervision of disarmament. Vyshinsky stated, "The atomic bomb is like the sword of Damocles hanging by a thread. Only by removing this threat can we feel safe. If you have no intention of using it, why not prohibit its production? The UN mechanism must prevent the failure of universal disarmament, must abolish all weapons, and must begin by abolishing the most dangerous ones." US Representative and Senator Connally then took the floor, reiterating that the United States would not disarm unilaterally, and declared that before a global disarmament plan could be put into practice and atomic bombs declared illegal, all outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and other nations must be resolved. Connally stated that while the United States welcomes any international action regarding disarmament, the United States maintains that an agreement on the control and use of atomic energy must first be established before taking such action. Disarmament cannot be implemented effectively until a collective security system under the supervision of the UN mechanism is effectively implemented. Connally also presented a plan for universal disarmament and guarantees of implementation, containing eight measures, reiterating the US position, but without mentioning veto power. Vyshinsky once again stated frankly that the Soviet Union has no intention of abandoning veto power, even when resolving the disarmament issue. UK Chief Representative Shawcross, in a provocative tone, demanded that Vyshinsky clarify his position on veto power, reportedly stating, "We must ensure that any control is not obstructed by veto power." Vyshinsky replied, "We have no intention of abandoning the principle of unanimity (i.e., veto power), and there is no reason to change our position now. The control agencies for weapons and atomic bombs are often within the scope of the Security Council and must be subject to the full voting procedures of that council," a point Foreign Minister Molotov had already explained.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] The UN structure has decided to intensify its work, working seven days a week and holding meetings as usual at night, in order to conclude all the work of the General Assembly before Christmas. Therefore, the Political Committee and the two Trusteeship Subcommittees are scheduled to close on Sunday, while other committees are also beginning to hold night meetings from today. The Secretariat has decided to instruct all committees to conclude discussions by next Friday, so that the full General Assembly can take final decisions on the proposals of each committee from December 1st, and conclude this task by December 13th. It is reported that many European representatives have already booked berths for December 14th, preparing to return home for Christmas.

### Review of Peace Treaty Reparation Clauses; Progress in Four Foreign Ministers Conference; Peace Treaty with Germany to Be Discussed in Europe

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th (Broadcast): The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference achieved a major breakthrough today. Regarding the reparations of Italy and Bulgaria to Yugoslavia and Greece, the Soviet Union had previously insisted that Yugoslavia should receive twice as much as Greece, on the grounds that Yugoslavia suffered twice the war losses of Greece. However, in today's Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference, Molotov has abandoned this strong claim and agreed with Byrnes's proposal that the reparations received by the two countries should be equal, but there is still no agreement on the total amount of reparations from Italy and Bulgaria.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] The "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic correspondent reports: Since Prime Minister Bevin returned from the United States, Britain may establish a resident envoy in Germany. Once the peace treaty with Germany's associated countries is established, the peace treaty with Germany itself may be discussed in Europe.

### Trusteeship Subcommittee Rejects; South Africa's Annexation of Southwest Africa

[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] The Trusteeship Committee of the UN's Subcommittee rejected today the proposal by the Union of South Africa to annex its mandated territory of Southwest Africa, but at the same time decided to leave the door open for future discussions. The latter vote was based on a joint proposal by the United States and Denmark, namely that the current General Assembly should not take action on the issue of Southwest Africa's annexation by South Africa. The US-Danish proposal, after being passed by the Subcommittee today, will be submitted to the Trusteeship Committee for consideration.

### Siam Withdraws Lawsuit Against France from the United Nations

France Endorses Siam's Membership Application

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie announced today two letters, one from the Siamese delegation to the United States, withdrawing the country's lawsuit against France from the Security Council, and the other from the French representative, supporting Siam's application to join the United Nations as a member state.

### Food Relief Plan; Has Received Soviet Support

[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] The $400 million food relief plan proposed by UNRRA Director La Guardia has received Soviet support, as stated by its representative Gromyko in a speech at the UN Economic and Financial Committee today. Gromyko said that the Soviet Union, which suffered greatly from the war damage inflicted by the enemy, will contribute a small portion of its burden to the organization. Gromyko also made it clear that the food and economic fund supported by the Soviet Union must be managed in accordance with the same international principles as the UNRRA organization.

### Merger of British and American Zones in Germany; Negotiations May Be Completed Next Week

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] This radio station announced: Deputy Secretary of State Acheson announced that negotiations on the merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany may be concluded next week.

[Reuters, London, 29th] After the completion of the British-American negotiations on the merger of the two occupation zones in Germany, the entire administrative issue of the British zone in Germany will be reviewed. Britain has now agreed in principle to share with the United States the cost of 250 million pounds every three years for the two zones, but after the merger of the two zones, the proportion of US dollars to British pounds in trade will change, meaning that more goods will be purchased from non-dollar zones in the future.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Rumors that the British and American governments are pressuring the French government to agree to the merger of the three occupation zones within Germany could not be confirmed here.

### Soviet Troops in the German Occupation Zone; Begin Large-Scale Withdrawal; This is a Sign of Major Changes in Soviet Policy

[United Press, London, 29th] This newspaper published a dispatch from Berlin quoting Soviet staff officers as saying that Soviet troops have withdrawn on a large scale from eastern Germany. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: This is "very likely" and pointed out that Stalin answered the inquiry of the President of the United Press on October 28, stating that the Soviet troops of sixty divisions in Eastern Europe will be reduced to forty divisions within two months. It is said that this withdrawal is in compliance with the recent demobilization order issued by the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 29th] The large-scale withdrawal of Soviet troops from the German occupation zone shows that there has been a major change in Soviet policy to align with the US and British policies. The news of the Soviet troop withdrawal was released by the US Deputy Governor Keating and the German side. According to Keating, part of the Soviet troops has begun to withdraw to their country, which is in line with the guarantee recently provided by the Soviet authorities at the Four-Power Control Council. German officials said that the Soviet occupation zone will be divided into five states, each with a legislative body and an administrative body, which is the same as the US and British occupation zones. The Soviet policy originally intended to establish a centralized government in its German occupation zone, which shows that its attitude has changed. This new Soviet policy may be modeled on the US Secretary of State's proposal to implement a federal system in Germany, with the states and the Four-Power Control Council sharing its ruling power. There is no definite information on the number of Soviet troops withdrawn. The London Daily Mail said that about 300,000 Soviet troops have been withdrawn this time. US military intelligence personnel reported that "Soviet troops in Berlin have not shown any signs of decreasing. If the Soviet troops are really withdrawing on a large scale, they will definitely trumpet it to promote their disarmament proposals at the UN General Assembly."

### December 2nd Designated as; US "Atomic Energy Day"

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] The United States has decided to designate December 2nd as "Atomic Energy Day" to commemorate the invention of the atomic bomb. At that time, the Oak Ridge atomic bomb factory in Tennessee, the Chicago manufacturing plant, and the Alamos atomic experiment site in New Mexico will all hold commemorative ceremonies. According to the US atomic bomb manufacturing plan, the so-called "Manhattan Project," was formulated on December 4th, and all subsequent atomic bomb experiment plans originated from this.

### Near East Anti-Communist Conference; Will Be Held in Baghdad at the End of This Year; Iraq Declares Good Neighbor Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Beirut, 30th] According to the "Oriental Daily," Turkey, Egypt, and Iraq are scheduled to hold an anti-communist conference in Baghdad at the end of this December to discuss ways to resist communism in the Near East and the Middle East. It is said that representatives from other Arab countries have been invited to participate.

[Reuters, Baghdad, 29th] Iraqi Prime Minister Said told Reuters reporters today that it is untrue that I intend to organize Greater Syria. I only know to work for a free and strong Arab world. I also hold the same attitude towards plans for close cooperation with foreign countries. Said also stated that I have never signed a military agreement with Turkey on behalf of Iraq. Turkey and Iran are both our neighbors, and we should maintain good neighborly relations.

### Reddening of Europe; Stalin Has Ambitions

Impressions of a US Newspaper Publisher Traveling in Europe

[United Press, San Francisco, 29th] Newspaper publisher Gannett, who has just returned to the United States after traveling in Europe, said in a speech: He believes that Stalin has ambitions to redden Europe, "In the future, if Stalin wants to march into Europe, he will not encounter much resistance."

### Slavic Congress; Will Be Held in the Southern Capital

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 29th] It has been learned that the Soviet delegation to the Slavic National Congress has set off today for Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. Wellington Koo and Zhang Qun paid a visit to the US President on October 29th, and the photo was taken when they left the White House (US Information Service).

### United Nations Decides; to Ban Opium; Our Delegation Expresses Gratitude

[United Press, Lake Success, 29th] The UN Narcotics Control Committee recommended today that all member states ban the sale of opium for smoking, and the Chinese representative welcomed the passage of this bill. The Chinese delegation strongly argued that the facts of mutual blame among countries in the past regarding the opium issue must be forgotten. This refers to the story of the large-scale import of opium into China many years ago, but it is only for reference. The resolution recommends taking various steps to prohibit the production, domestic transportation, and use of opium.

### Greek Guerrilla Warfare in Northern Greece; Extends to the Turkish Border

Greek Prime Minister Decides to Go to New York

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 30th (Broadcast): The Greek cabinet held a meeting today and decided that Prime Minister Tsaldaris will immediately go to New York to report the border conflict incident to the Security Council. It is expected that he will also insist on Greece's border demands on Albania and Bulgaria at the Four Powers Conference, and may also request relief loans from the US government for use when the UN stops providing aid.

[Associated Press, Athens, 30th] It was reported here today: The guerrilla warfare in northern Greece has expanded to the Turkish border. Guerrillas and government forces have been in fierce conflict for a long time, with a total of ninety-two people killed. It is reported that the conflict took place in the Soufli region on the Greek-Turkish border, 180 miles northeast of Thessaloniki and only 130 miles from Istanbul.

### Japanese Reparations Plan; Largely Approved by Britain; US is Negotiating with Relevant Countries

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] The new plan proposed by US Reparations Commissioner Pauley completely prohibits Japan from having aluminum and magnesium industries. The annual steel production is limited to 2.75 million tons, and all production of copper and nickel is for reparations. Japan's machine tool inventory should be reduced to 175,000 sets, and subsequent annual production is limited to 1,000 sets. Ships are limited to 5,000 tons per ship, and the total tonnage must not exceed 1.5 million tons. Its 114 ships, totaling 869,000 tons, will be used for reparations. The annual production of train locomotives is limited to 22 sets, passenger cars to 800, and freight cars to 4,800. Its 970 train locomotives and 30,000 freight cars will be used for reparations. The chemical industry is limited to meeting its own needs. The fishing, textile, and ceramics industries are not interfered with. It is reported that Britain has largely approved this plan, but the Soviet Union has not yet indicated its approval.

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the United States has begun discussing the distribution of Japanese reparations with the other ten countries. This matter is being consulted by the State Department with the countries concerned individually, and it is hoped that a solution can be obtained soon. Acheson also said that the United States hopes that the countries concerned will jointly assist in drafting instructions to be issued to MacArthur for execution, so that the new proposals of Reparations Commissioner Pauley, such as the Japanese arsenals and industrial equipment used for reparations, will be distributed in advance by 15 to 20 percent. The State Department is reviewing Pauley's report in detail. Other government officials also said that the Soviet Union would firmly refuse to participate in the reparations distribution meeting, but the United States still intends to consult with it.

### Qingbai Wins Over Jewish Team by Five Goals

McNitty's Poor Performance Causes Underdog to Lay an Egg

In the football league's first division, Qingbai and the Jewish team battled at the Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon, with over two thousand spectators. The Jewish team was late, and the match started at 2:40 pm. As a result, Qingbai won by a large margin of five to zero, with a score of three to zero in the first half.

Opening the Record in One Minute

Qingbai kicked off, passing the ball back and forth. Song Lingsheng headed Xue Weitai's hook shot, and Lingzai rushed up to nudge the ball. The ball bounced off the goalpost and was kicked into the net by McNitty, just one minute after the start of the match. Three minutes later, Luo Shoufu headed the ball over, Zhang Renyi hooked and shot, McNitty miscalculated, and the ball fell into the right corner of the net, two to zero. The Jewish team counterattacked, but to no avail. At 23 minutes, Song Lingzai advanced in the middle, Bao Zheng received the ball and went deep. McNitty rushed out and collided with Xiao Gao, both falling to the ground, while the ball flew into the empty goal, three to zero. After that, it was still Qingbai's world, but Xue Weitai and Meng Yiliang's two shots were saved by McNitty lying on the ground. Before long, the first half ended, with Qingbai leading by three goals.

Jewish Team Attacks but Fails

After switching sides, the battle resumed, and the Jewish team's offense was very strong. Qingbai's penalty area was crisscrossed by iron cavalry, but in the end, due to the Jewish team's scattered forwards and bad luck, they often fell short and achieved nothing. After fifteen minutes, Luo Choufu went deep into the hinterland alone and swept the ball in from the left corner, scoring again, four to zero. Ten minutes later, Mo Lingsheng's shot was blocked. McNitty saved the ball away from the goal, but Bao Zheng happened to be there and kicked it into the net, ending the match at five to zero.

In the last two charity matches last night, the men's and women's teams were pleased to win both, which can be regarded as a commemorative gift to bid farewell to the team. The women's team first defeated the Green team 25 to 16, using men's rules, to avenge the humiliation of the defeat the day before. The score was twelve to twelve in the first half, and the Green team was still able to fight in the first half, but they were exhausted in the second half and finally lost. The men's team, Black and White, came from behind to defeat the US military Maclins Helena team, fifty to forty-two. The score was twenty-one to twenty-six in the first half, with Black and White behind. It was estimated that there were thousands of spectators last night. Before the game, Wu Shaoshu, the vice president of the Sports Association, presented the Black and White men's and women's teams with a banner each. At halftime of the men's game, Shao Rugan, the director-general of the Sports Association, presented the Black and White team with a large silver cup on behalf of the Basketball Committee as a memorial, which was accepted by Zhuang Yuxi amidst the sound of drums. The entire Black and White team is scheduled to return to the Philippines in two batches tomorrow (week one) and next Friday, and some will transfer to Xiamen before returning south.

Charity Income

Before the start of the last quarter of the men's game, Liu Hesheng reported the charity income, totaling 243 five thousand yuan tickets upstairs and 232 one thousand yuan tickets downstairs, totaling 1,911,000 yuan. In addition, the two million yuan honorary tickets sold by the Shanghai branch of the Overseas Chinese Federation will be announced tomorrow.

Black and White Women Win Against Green Team

Black and White Takes the Lead and Ties the Score

At 6:30, the Black and White Green team women's match began. Black and White played with Huang Rulan, Chen Yurun, Ye Yiqing, Xiao Fanleng, and Wu Yuwu, while the Green team was Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Chen Huanzhi, Wang Weizhen, and Liu Zhenbao. Xiao Fanleng was first fouled into the basket, and Rulan added a throw, and Black and White took the lead with four to zero. The Green team, Mingyuan, was penalized once, and Yurun also scored one point. The Green team called a timeout and saw an instant improvement, scoring seven consecutive points. Black and White quickly replaced Ye Yiqing with Lu Shuhui. At the end of the first quarter, the Green team came from behind with eight to six. In the second quarter, Yang Xiuzhi replaced Xiao Fanleng, and after ten to six, Huang Rulan scored four consecutive points with throws and penalties. Rong Shujian also made a contribution, and Yurun shot in, ending the first half. Each scored twelve, and the colors were evenly divided.

Green Team's Female Generals Show Fatigue The difficult and indistinguishable battle situation in the first half could not be maintained by the Green team in the second half. In the first quarter, Black and White scored nine consecutive points, and the Green team only scored two points, and the fate was determined. The Green team first brought in Liu Zhenbao, Wang Weizhen, Ren Meiyi, Wu Ailian, Lu Shuhui made a wonderful shot, and Wu Yuwu shot in. The Green team called a timeout, and Liu Zhenbao and Wang Zazhen returned to the field. When Green Team Zhenbao broke the basket, the third quarter ended, with the Green team trailing by fourteen to twenty-one. In the last quarter, the Green team worked hard to strengthen, but the Black and White defense was tight. The Green team's female generals were already tired after the fierce battle. Wu Yuwu and Ru each scored one goal. The Green team was re-scored by Yao Zhenbao, and the result was twenty-five to sixteen, Black and White won.

Men's Team Wins Helun

The Helena Team Thrives First and Then Declines

In the final match, the Black and White men's team competed against the US Marine Corps Helena. Foreigner Pison was the first to score and break the record, and Oscuro added a touch, while Black and White only scored one point with a penalty from Lin Ziyi. In the first quarter, Helena scored fifteen points, while Black and White only scored four points. In the second quarter, Black and White showed some improvement. Zhuang Yuxi made a long shot, and Xu Yinzhen made a close shot, both scoring, and the morale was boosted. The score gradually narrowed, and the first half ended, with Black and White trailing by twenty-one to twenty-six.

Working Harder, Black and White Wins

In the second half, the contact was resumed, and Black and White replaced Xu Yinzhen with Shi Ronglu. At thirty-one to twenty-three, Black and White replaced Xu Yinzhen with Li Jinzao. Shen Renshou made a shot from the baseline, and Li Jinzao added a touch. Black and White finally tied the score. Zhuang Yuxi was like a god, with left and right opportunities, and in an instant, Black and White took the lead with thirty-five to thirty-one. The third quarter ended. In the last ten minutes, the battle situation became more tense. Before long, Zhuang Yuxi was disqualified for five fouls, and Walkerhi replaced him on the field. Renshou was like entering an uninhabited area, with two throws and one penalty, leading with forty-four to thirty-eight. When time was up, Black and White won fifty to forty-two.

Film and Drama

### Watching "The Outlaw Heroes"

— Ding Zhi

I feel that with the manpower and material resources, plus the screenwriter and director, the work that satisfied me in the past was "Wen Tianxiang," and currently it's "The Outlaw Heroes."

The screenwriter's selection of material and the clarity of the theme are flawless.

The directing can be described as concise and clear. Every scene's movement resembles film shots on the silver screen, giving a sense of "beauty." Especially several crowd scenes are neither piled together nor chaotic, but rather arranged in an orderly manner, forming beautiful and majestic images. I think the director must be Mr. Hong, otherwise the actors would not be so obedient.

The set design is quite original, and the lighting also cooperates effectively, which further enhances the performance.

The actors, including Ye Gao, Xia Tian, Wang Ping, Feng ?, Lan Ma, Jun Wei, Gao Yang, Shi Jingshan, Shen Yang, Chen Jing, etc., play various key roles in the play. The compactness of the performance increases people's interest. I am by no means an idol worshiper, but a good script must have experienced actors to make it a resounding success.

What's even more commendable are the so-called extras inside. Some say one or two lines, and some don't speak at all, but they all stick to their roles, helping to enhance the performance without being frivolous or taking advantage. They act in a serious manner. I can say that this is the first time I've seen this since watching stage plays. If every performance could have such a cooperative spirit, stage plays would not be difficult to flourish.

Among the actors, I particularly like Wang Ping. In the play, she plays the elder sister-in-law, a good helper to her husband, and a shrewd and capable housewife. From the dialogue of the characters on stage, the outline of the elder sister-in-law is introduced in this way, and later Wang Ping's performance brings her to life. A spectator sitting behind me exclaimed, "It's really too good!" Of course, he was also referring to Wang Ping's acting skills. It's a pity that I'm not familiar with Miss Wang Ping and don't know if Miss Wang's personality is also like this in private. If not, but she can portray the character of the character so clearly and grasp it so steadily, it is indeed admirable. If the play is well acted, people will naturally appreciate it, and there is really no need to use any "famous actress" to promote it.

Next is Xia Tian. He plays an antagonist, a spy type. Originally, when performing this type of role, the actor often likes to emphasize his shortcomings, making people feel "over the top." Xia Tian's performance is just right, which is not easy.

Lan Ma's acting has always been steady. Indeed, many characters with status in the play need Lan Ma to play them in order to highlight how important the character's position is. Someone once asked me, "Is Shi Hui good? Or is Lan Ma good?" I said, "Each has his own path, both are good." Tonight, seeing Lan Ma's demeanor on stage reminded me of a metaphor. I think Shi Hui is like the Peking opera actor Qilin Tong, while Lan Ma is like Gai Jiaotian. Especially tonight, his posture is quite like Gai Jiaotian singing Lu Junyi in "Da Ming Fu." Moreover, in my opinion, his facial makeup is almost indistinguishable from the real person.

Shen Yang's pronunciation is clear and his voice is loud, which are his good assets. I have seen him in several plays, playing different roles, and he can give people different impressions. He is truly a lovable actor.

Wei Wei is better than the several plays she has performed in the past. I think it must be because she likes the personality of the third sister this time, or it matches her.

All the other actors worked hard and were very responsible. It was truly satisfying to watch.

At the end, I seemed to feel that something was missing, and the eldest brother's rushing out seemed to be deliberately feeding himself to the bullets. Similarly, the fifth brother went out and was fine, it seems that the eldest brother's death was a bit forced.

Honestly, this "Outlaw Heroes" is a real work of art, and can also be said to be a "representative of spoken drama."

Secondly, if the time for changing scenes can be sped up a bit, I believe it will definitely bring back the lost audience.

Also, in the second scene of the second act, the actors of the heroes from all walks of life are students from the Municipal Experimental Drama School. After watching it, it is regrettable that they are all a group of drama enthusiasts. Now that the school has been revoked, it is like a group of orphans without support. I wonder if the school will think of a way for them? Otherwise, the professors should also introduce them to a way to continue learning drama.

### "Meng Jiangnu" Opera Adaptation

— Song Qingwan

The Chinese Dance Drama Co.'s opera "Meng Jiangnu" is coming to Nanjing this time, and friends in the music and drama circles certainly can't miss this opportunity. Even though the tickets are so expensive, they can't help but sacrifice a bit. And the result obtained was disappointment.

When opera does not have a clear path in China, no one can say for sure how opera in this country should be approached. In "Meng Jiangnu," Chinese old opera actors are paired with a Western orchestra. Chinese opera stage steps are used, plus Western modern dance. Ancient Chinese costumes are worn, and Impressionist scenery is used as a background... This kind of performance, which is chaotic and nondescript, does not even achieve the most basic "unity."

The leader and composer of the opera is an old Russian man, Avshalomoff. Musically, except for the flute playing a bit of an oriental flavor in the "December Meng Jiangnu" tune, everything else can be said to be Western symphonic music. Mr. Avshalomoff's ideals for Chinese opera are quite right. He said: "Chinese musical drama is richer than Western art, especially folk art is full of unrestrained emotions. Turning literature into opera is very ideal." But Mr. Avshalomoff's performance is quite the opposite. In this opera, we did not see any characteristics that could represent Chinese opera.

Mr. Avshalomoff has a good understanding of Wagner, the pioneer of musical drama. He wants to use Chinese medicinal materials and his own imagination and skills to create Chinese-style works of art. There are many types of old Chinese drama, and it is difficult for not only Mr. Avshalomoff, but also the Chinese themselves, to understand them clearly. The more experienced friends in Nanjing did not quite agree with this performance.

It is admirable that a foreign friend puts in such effort for Chinese opera. What we hope is that he can study it more thoroughly, because the opera "Meng Jiangnu" is to represent Chinese opera abroad, and it can also be said to introduce Chinese art abroad. If Chinese opera is like this, I am afraid there will be problems.

### A Shot from "Reeds Turn White, Swallows Fly"

### About Chen Baichen

— Zhou Si, written in Suzhou

Previously, in this publication, Mr. Na Ya listed four of our country's playwrights and introduced and reviewed them separately, which is a good reference for readers who love drama. But I think it is worthwhile to re-examine the parts about Cao Yu and Chen Baichen.

In Cao Yu's early works, there is indeed a hint of characters being dominated by fate, especially in "Thunderstorm"; but it is not necessarily "fatalism."

Chen Baichen is a master of comedy, and "Promotion Chart" is even more aimed at reality. The author once said that he wrote "Promotion Chart" in order to conduct an examination. We also cannot deny that there is no shadow of this group of people in the current society. Mr. Na Ya said: "The officials in 'Promotion Chart' seem a bit too exaggerated. The officials say whatever they want. They forgot about the rights of the people." Yes, when a real person is cartoonized and portrayed as a character in a comedy, it is inevitable that there will be some exaggeration. However, it is precisely because of this exaggeration that we can more clearly recognize these people. And for those living in the occupied areas, they can even more know the truth of a group in The New Official Takes Office.

Another point is that the editor of Phoenix City is Wu Zuguang, not Yuan Jun.

### "Resurrection"

— Tang Ke

Recently, " " has put Tolstoy's "Resurrection" on the Yue opera stage, which cannot be said to be anything but glory for the Yue opera circle.

"Resurrection" has been adapted into a stage play. Domestically, it has been adapted successively by the senior drama figures Tian Han and Xia Yan. Tian Han's adaptation focuses on the land issue, while Xia Yan's adaptation expresses the male protagonist Nekhlyudov's psychological process of repentance after committing a crime against the female protagonist Katyusha, and also reflects the shamelessness of the aristocratic society at that time. Although their adaptation intentions are different, their reverence for Tolstoy's humanism is not.

I don't know where their adaptation points are. If they only see the twists and turns of its story structure, or extract Nekhlyudov and Katyusha's tender feelings and tragic romance, then adapting it will not only fail to convey Tolstoy's spirit, but also ignore the original work's profound educational significance. This speculation is based on my viewing of the story of the talented scholars and beautiful women's joys and sorrows in "Phoenix Lovesickness." Therefore, when "Resurrection" is adapted into Yue opera, it must not be biased towards the "ambiguous" relationship between Nekhlyudov and Katyusha, and should instead focus on respecting Tolstoy's original spirit.

Since the correctness of the theme has been determined, the work cannot be adapted into a Chinese work by changing the national conditions. In fact, China is still China, and Russia is still Russia. Chinese customs must not be infiltrated into Russian life. Otherwise, we will see Russians with Chinese thoughts and feelings on the Yue opera stage.

I hope that this Yue opera troupe, which is praised by people, can break out of the old nest in this adaptation and stand on a new and true artistic position!

The International Film Festival held in Cannes, on the southern Mediterranean coast of France, in October 1946, had a magnificent atmosphere and was a sensation at the time. A total of 155 films in fourteen languages were shown successively. The types can be roughly divided into three categories. The first type is pieced together from plots, such as plays, that is, the shadow plays we are used to, which can also be called drama movies. The second type captures real scenes and adds artistry, called "cultural film", also known as "film archives". The third type is delicate painting of comics, which can be called "animated slides". As a rule, each competition's product must have at least one shadow play and one film archive. The third item is an optional category. The United States is still the best in this, from their first inventor Walt Disnay, When competition results, The awards category has only one big award, the other twenty four award is national, Their products won a international award, first is France, this is war archive, named guerilla in back stage. the second place is Russia, this is color sport film archive, there are 25000 men and women youth in Moscow city Red place. Hidden indicate the national power, A good plan for overseas advertising. The name is My Country Youth. The last Every Country

### French Cannes Film Competition

— Hong Fu

has the opportunity to win the national award for the best product. The winner of the blood account representing a country. The American award is "Unnecessary Weekend". The French Award is "Ensemble of Rural Beauty". The Italian award for film archive masterpiece is "Unfortified Rome". The Dutch Award is the famine that records the facts of 1944 and 1945. The Russian Award is called "Sharp Turn Down". The Danish Award is called "Blood Land". The British Award is called "A short trip". The Indian Award is "Down Town" describing the workers' area. Others such as Czech, Mexican, Swedish and Swiss works, the best have awards. Only Switzerland has the last chance to win the national award." A film category simultaneously received the International Peace Prize for its efforts to promote peace. Looking at the award-giving standards, it seems that emphasis is still placed on patriotic actions and war. This comes from the judgment of the judges, which is slightly different from the general audience's intentions. The audience has shown boredom with the old articles such as the dangerous aspects of war and the secret resistance of patriotic youths during the war. If the connoisseur goes one step further and pays attention to the psychological test of the masses, then the best performance of the pre-competition product from beginning to end is the American comedian, Kay Yiyi's performance of "Strange Man". As a result, the whole audience laughed for more than fifty minutes. It is a pity that he did not win the award. It is sad that there are so many uncoordinated things in the world, and everything can be viewed in this way.

### Rambling About New Films

— Ma Boliang

Christmas

A holiday piled up with fire trees and silver flowers, joy inevitably hides the old dreams of sorrow, a wild goose's footprints in life. Mo Han wrote this idea into "Christmas". A Londoner got tired of playing cards and went to Paris to find stimulation. A prostitute's miserable statement made the person lose interest and quietly return to his card table to settle down. The film adaptation is quite different from the original work. The role of the lieutenant is temporarily added for national conditions, which becomes a snake's feet and loses the original work's meaning of life. Director Robert Siodmak seems to be French. His works "The Killers" and "Criss Cross" both show distinctiveness. This film's handling is meticulous and clear in terms of cumbersome details, especially the arrangement of tense situations, which is ingenious and concise. Tells us that he is indeed a first-class director of mystery films. But because of this, he did not understand the meaning of this poorly adapted script, and therefore could not express the power of this tragedy. The beginning and ending feel very vulgar. I think the ending shot can use Diana Durbin's eyes to push the camera all the way forward into the heroine's eyes, a big close-up, let the eyes become a black ocean, vast, a drop of white shaking tear, flowing down, magnified, with the word END appearing on it, symbolizing this woman's life of swallowing her voice and enduring tears. This may be a small supplement to this simple film.

Blood Tears in the Sea of Love

Restoring primitive love is the greatest hope of city dwellers. Naked bathing in the deep sea, living in caves as mandarin ducks, naked and happy life. The male protagonist in "Flame of Fury" therefore returns to the embrace of the South China Sea. Li Quoque in "Blood Tears in the Sea of Love" leaves the romance of Spanish Gypsies and returns to the civilized world of England, letting the passionate Gypsy dancer die for love, letting a pair of childhood sweethearts go through hardships and regain their old love. This is the British national sense of excellence, the Londoner's romantic fantasy. "Blood Tears in the Sea of Love" is an extremely romantic Melocrama, love, jealousy, conspiracy, trap, murder, fate, reunion, suicide, death... It is exactly the complete element of Melodrama. This film is also typically British in style, long and tortuous, with a very full flavor. The director's technique is fierce and powerful, the burial in quicksand, the enchanting demon's dance, the impression is profound. The male protagonist Stewart Granger is both civil and military, and the female protagonist Jean Kent's beauty and art are also not ordinary even in Hollywood. Anne Crawford's bearing is indeed noble, but I always prefer the passionate beauty of the Gypsy.

A Talented Man and a Beautiful Woman

Writers should not dream, this kind of story is just material on the screen, making the fake real, it is still a play, a comedy with a plot that does not fall into the cliché, even if some old jokes are used, it can still cause laughter. After "Bringing Up Baby", "The Ghost Goes West", "The Amazing Mr. Smith", "Here Comes Mr. Jordan", "The Gay Divorcee", and "That Uncertain Feeling", "It Happened One Night", "Canary Row" and this "A Talented Man and a Beautiful Woman" are the comedies that I am most satisfied with. From the beginning of the subtitles to the end when the professors bring it to an end, it is really full of jokes. Seven old fools plus a silly young linguist, learning the local language, recognizing the wrong father-in-law, temporarily learning boxing, and still being serious, as if it were true. It is rare for a bookworm to fall in love without causing people to laugh. Director Howard Hawks' scheduling is very smooth, and the hubs of each humorous occasion are also well connected. Mylee Cooper and Blanche Stanley are getting better and better as they get older. Gary Cooper's style of a rough man has long become a school. Blanche's entire body is always full of drama. Her section of undressing and waving her thighs is dazzling. No wonder the old maid said that she was the kind of woman who destroyed all civilization. It is a pity that the clothes she wears do not show off her figure, but fortunately, after her bangs are rolled up, she still looks like a young woman, and it can be said that her appearance is as beautiful as a flower.

Meet Me in St. Louis

Looking back, it is the good old days of forty years ago, existing in the colorful New Year's cards, reappearing before our eyes, a piece of sunshine, a piece of snowflake, a piece of fallen leaf, the whispers of first love, the prom of youth, the melodious sound of the car bell, the quiet starry night, all are so kind. I really like the family in St. Louis, Missouri. A bright piano sound and a gentle singing voice, a house full of men, women, old and young, close and warm, a harmonious atmosphere, each person has a forever shining orange year, like the shining time in my own past life. I don't like the vulgar singing and dancing of ordinary song and dance films, but I love "Meet Me in St. Louis", the lovable actors' laughter, and the simple and sincere singing and dancing: "Meet Me in St. Louis", "I'm in Love with the Boy Next Door", "I'll Get By". The clusters of flowers in the streetcar are an adult's fairy tale world. The lit living-room after the show makes me want to watch "Meet Me in St. Louis" again, looking for a hazy past, a warm life.

Spring and Autumn

### Emotions

— Jing Shan

The famous Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov once wrote a short story about a small theater. The plot is very simple. The general idea is that in the city where all the theaters are full every day, there is a small theater that no one goes to visit; because there are too few spectators, it has to stop performing and refund the money to the only few spectators. This is already the ×th night. The owner of the place is busy arranging everything, preparing to start the performance, but when the time comes, there are only a sparse four or five viewers on the seat. So a minute, a quarter of an hour, and an hour pass, there are absolutely no new viewers, and the people on the seats gradually become listless. Finally, the curtain opens, but it is the owner of the place who comes out, and he mournfully announces that the evening's performance has to be cancelled, and asks everyone to go to the door to get a refund.

The story is simple, and the author has not used any surprising techniques, but this short story gives me a very deep impression. The only reason, I think, is that the emotions contained in that short story are too touching.

Originally, the essence of art is the connection of human emotions. Emotion is a base force (borrowing Freud's term). This base force uncontrollably wants to find a way to vent, and the creation of art is one of them.

For example, many folk mountain songs are works of mature emotion. Compared with certain coy new poems or essays, the former's degree of touching is superior to the latter's. Also, for example, a "ordinary novel" with mature emotions can be more touching than a work with a bizarre and tortuous plot and novel writing techniques. Because a fictional work that has not been mixed with the author's emotions is like a soulless body. How can this arouse the reader's resonance? It also fundamentally goes against the essence of art.

Therefore, for a great work, in addition to content and skills, what is indispensable is emotion; otherwise, it can only be called the story of a "story craftsman" or the propaganda text of a propagandist.

But let's try the current literary and artistic works. Just take novels as an example, there are quite a lot of them, especially literary journals, which seem to be incomplete if they don't publish one or two novels. But what about their content? Eighty or ninety percent of them are just stories with empty shells. What's the point of that? What's a pity is what those "non-practitioners" write. Because before they step into the stage of "non-practitioners", in addition to the mastery of skills, they must have also had a very good nurturing of emotions, but now they only focus on the development of skills. Isn't this very regrettable?

Let us repeat again: "The essence of art is the connection of humans, emotions." What violates this essence can only provide amusement or enjoyment for certain people, but can never be called complete art.

### Seeking Friendly Voices: On Literary Tea Parties

(1) Zong Lu

A gathering like a literary tea party is something I personally felt a great need for as soon as I arrived in Shanghai. This city of extravagant pleasures rarely has good places for humble cultural people like us. Moreover, after eight years of war, old friends are scattered. Even friends who are currently in Shanghai together rarely have the opportunity to chat. Economic hardship further affects the connection of friendships. Therefore, such a gathering can also be said to meet a general need. If participants can embrace a pure and sincere enthusiasm to establish new friendships, future expansion can be predicted.

The nature of the tea party can certainly be limited to the two topics of leisure after work and connecting emotions. However, it wouldn't hurt to pay a little attention to literary discussions to promote the atmosphere and encourage each other. For example, today most of us came from the Qi Baishi painting exhibition. It wouldn't hurt to express our feelings and criticisms about Qi's art, or to discuss creative issues based on the works in publications such as "Chunqiu" and "Wen Chao." This will not only provide young participants with rich and satisfying gains but also fill the tea party itself with unlimited vitality. The position and viewpoint of the reviews are completely free, without establishing any sects. Everyone should be true to the original intention of art and strive for further progress together. It is hoped that the literary tea party will not fall into the criticism of being "idle" but will have real content. Secondly, participants can also raise any questions on literature and art and ask a writer to express opinions and answers.

(2) Yu Jianhua

Last Sunday afternoon, I went to the Chess and Wine House on the fifth floor of the Great New Company for the first time to participate in the fourth literary tea party. Now I have some small opinions to offer to the members for reference:

(1) That day, four or five families were getting married in the wine house on the fifth floor. Guests were crowded, and music was playing noisily, which was extremely noisy. I think literary tea parties should find a quieter and more elegant place, where we can taste tea, talk quietly, and express our heartfelt feelings. This will not only match the name with the reality but also allow people who are busy and tired all day to have half a day of leisure, temporarily putting aside national affairs, social unrest, economic oppression, and family trivial matters. Let's talk about wonderful theories freely, so that the excessively tense nerves can be relaxed. Wouldn't that be great? However, the current venue is too noisy, only suitable for those drunken and extravagant gentlemen to seek pleasure. It's really not suitable for us poor scholars to sit there and talk. Therefore, I formally propose to Mr. Shen Nianhua, Mr. Lin Jinshan, and others. Please have mercy and change the place.

(2) I think we should buy a thicker ten-line notebook (preferably bound pages) for signing our names in order. First-time attendees must provide their mailing address and occupation for future communication. The signatures from the previous four sessions can be pasted in the front. In this way, the number of people each time can also be easily calculated. Over time, it may be helpful for the anecdotes of the literary and art circles. I wonder what you think?

(3) Ding Yi

The literary tea party has been held five times as of the 24th of this month. I participated in the first, fourth, and fifth times. I was not in Shanghai for the second and third times, so I couldn't attend.

The purpose of this gathering, as Mr. Hualin said in the first meeting, is just to talk about "friendship" and "love between friends." Yes, doesn't life need "love"? Is the realm of "love" limited to relationships between the sexes and within the family? Do friends need "love"? As human knowledge has developed to this day, I don't believe anyone can find a reason to answer in the negative!

The role of the literary tea party is only in tea and talking about "literature and art." Literature and art take love as its content. Only with love can there be beauty, and only with love can there be vitality. Therefore, this is also one of the places for cultivating the seeds of love in the world. If you don't believe it, please sit in the corner of this room, look around the room, and you will see people of all ages, with both grandeur and elegance. Some gather in groups of three or five, while others talk in pairs. You can only see sincere and modest expressions, and you can't find any pretentious or arrogant attitudes. What a harmonious scene! It is also a beautiful picture! That's the impression I have after returning from the meeting.

If we could invite a senior member to give a free talk at each meeting, of any length and on any topic, whether it be writing experience or daily observations (both special topics and casual talks are good, whether about flies or the universe), and let him improvise and express his unfettered opinions. It would be a very meaningful thing to allow the young people attending (including myself) to learn more about what makes art art. This is my hope and my proposal.

(4) Xu Zhongnian

Brothers Hualin and Jinshan sent three letters, asking me to reply in general. Before this, I also read Mr. Qingyang's letter and publicly replied to it in another newspaper. As the initiator, I am very grateful for everyone's concern for the "Literary Tea Party"! This tea party originally belongs to "everyone," and it should be cherished and improved by "everyone." Hualin, Chuntai, Chengyin, Jinshan, Yachen, and I are just doing a little more legwork.

At the fifth tea party, Hualin, Hanqiu, Jianhua, and I talked about: I don't know if we are old, or if society is old? In the past, the "Literary Tea Party" didn't have much preparation, but every time it was held, everyone would "automatically" speak, "automatically" perform, and "automatically" bring out works to ask for advice. In short, it was much more innocent than now! Since "innocence" has decreased now—whether it's age or the social environment that caused it—why not increase "artificiality" without utilitarian colors, which is what is called "preparation." However, when preparation is mentioned, there are two points that everyone needs to pay attention to: (1) "Everyone" should work hard to prepare and avoid focusing on a few people; (2) Busy. Busy. The poorer one is, the busier one gets. Now everyone is busier than before, so the progress of preparation will inevitably be slower and more difficult than before.

Although the location of the fifth tea party was still in the wine house on the fifth floor, it was changed to room number one. Mr. Jianhua participated and was very satisfied, saying: "It's very quiet here, we can talk!" The signature book originally didn't use several pages, so the two points raised by Mr. Jianhua can be said to be fully answered. As for the proactive talks proposed by Mr. Zong Lu and the love between friends indicated by Mr. Yi, it is exactly what is said, "Great minds think alike." We only need to work hard together under the important conditions of "harmony" and "simplicity"!

### Four Poems

— Translated from a Cetian original

Chrysanthemum

Snow-white shawl…

Golden yellow face…

People by the village, by the mountain, by the road

People…

Market little woman

Selling dew and yellow flowers

To the city of spirits,

For bread application…

Little flower leaning on green grass,

Shine! Ah

Do you think last night's rain was too heavy

Can't hold it?

Lilac

After the lilacs left

The breeze followed them

But the stream in the forest rippled,

Lost love, wandering.

I think the wind is a little sad

Turning the leaves, turning the branches,

I think the wind has become a

Selfish little thing!

After the lilacs left.

### I Am

Say cool

I am a willow trunk

Say black

I am an oriole

Say remember July

I am a little grape

Say remember May

I am a violet

康克靈, 茜兒特, is Mrs. Grace Hazard Conkling's daughter. Born in 1910, she is 36 years old this year. She was able to sing her own poems at the age of three. Her mother recorded her childhood feelings and poems. Like the "Poems of a Little Girl" at the age of ten and "The Shoes of the Wind" at the age of twelve, they are enough to prove her natural talent. The First World War broke out in 1914. She was only three or four years old at that time. That is to say, cruel wars were produced, but her beautiful poems were also produced. From the perspective of art and war, no, from the perspective of poetry and life, what a great hint this is! Kang's poems are vivid, innocent, and full of original purity.

This dance was, of course, extremely enjoyable, because both of them had smiles of victory on their faces. Who is the victor after all? Presumably, both of them thought they had won. This dance seemed to end Hemi Michiichi's busy day, and it also seemed to end his and Pingzi's adventure if it was really an adventure. After the dance, it was already two o'clock. The various people in the dance hall had already dispersed. Hemi and Pingzi were also preparing to go home, but they argued with each other, wanting to use their own cars to send the other person to their residence first. Hemi took Pingzi out of the dance hall. The two of them walked to the coat check, Hemi took his hat, and Pingzi took her shawl. They still followed Western etiquette, half-supporting and half-entwining, and walked out of the Mitsukoshi gate. At this time, neither of them paid attention. Suddenly, four burly Westerners rushed out from both sides and behind, covering the two of them with weapons. One of them was also wearing a tuxedo, with a monocle hanging from his chest, looking like a European aristocrat. He spoke fluent Japanese with a stiff accent:

"I'm very sorry, because of official business, please move to my superior's place for a few words... As long as you don't make any unexpected moves, I would never dare to be rude!"

"Who is your superior?" Hemi's attitude was unusually calm. While asking this question, he glanced at the people surrounding him, and he was also paying attention to Pingzi's expression. Pingzi lowered her head, returning to the traditional shy attitude of Japanese women.

"You will naturally understand when you get there. It's useless to say it." The monocle gentleman replied so simply, "Please get in the car beautifully!"

"Our country has laws. Please think thoroughly about whether this kind of behavior is legal!" Hemi resisted.

"What I represent is the strictest law in your country."

"Mr. Hemi," Pingzi frowned and glanced at Hemi, then lowered her head again, "Just go for a while, their superior is someone you know."

Hemi looked around. Not to mention his own car, even the shadow of Yezhu was nowhere to be seen. Number 012 and his men were also nowhere to be seen. Looking at the situation, putting the monocle gentleman's words and Pingzi's words together, he thought for a while and knew that this was a special situation. It was useless to resist, so he could only get into the gentleman's car beautifully. Pingzi also followed into the car and sat with Hemi, while the gentleman sat next to Pingzi.

Just as this car was about to start, a gorgeous car came speeding towards them, suddenly stopping at the door of the dance hall, blocking the way of this car. As soon as the car stopped, two middle-aged men dressed as military officers jumped out, followed by an elderly man in a kimono, and two others who seemed to be attendants or guards. After this group of people came down, they all raised their heads towards the dance troupe's gate, as if to identify whether the location was correct.

"Uncle Inoue," Pingzi shouted inside the car, "There is no music in the dance hall." The word "music" was clearly a code word.

### Cold Wave

— Shao Fu

The Siberian cold wave is invading mainland China. The temperature in the Yangtze River area has suddenly dropped to around zero degrees. According to a special report from this newspaper: Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Hankou and other places are all covered in snow, forming a silver-white world. Although it hasn't snowed in Shanghai, it has indeed been very cold these past two days.

As the climate gets colder, winter supplies are taking the opportunity to raise prices. For example, bituminous coal, the second layer of Kaiping, has reached 345,000 yuan per ton, and the black market price of coal balls has also reached 245,000 yuan per ton. This winter, under this situation, everyone will inevitably have to struggle through it with their hands and feet tied.

Living in a house, wearing warm clothes, and eating three meals a day, no matter how cold it is, it won't be life-threatening. Thinking about those who are wandering on the streets, without food or clothing, what a miserable situation that is! For them, every minute and every second is a struggle on the line of life and death, and these people, in places further away, such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and the Northeast... there are tens of thousands of them. We may not be able to witness them with our own eyes, but around us, can we turn a blind eye to these suffering people scattered in various parts of Shanghai?

In the past, wealthy Chinese people who were kind and generous often provided tea, porridge, clothes, and medicine as the seasons changed, and even provided coffins. Regardless of the impact or the motives, at least it preserved a part of human sympathy and showed people to do good. What contribution does this kind of social relief work that comes from the people contribute to the establishment of social morality on the passive side, even less than the relief work itself?

The weather is cold and freezing, please give those who eat the wind and drink the dew a little warmth!

Secret History of World War II

### Atomic Bomb Almost Used by the Nazis 3

— Lan Ning translated from the November issue of "Reader's Digest"

After the meeting, things progressed rapidly. Now they had a total of eleven Norwegians, hiding in the "Finch" hiding place, secretly discussing. Aino provided the latest information about guard locations, shift change times, etc. The attackers would follow several miles of steep, rugged, snow-covered mountain roads down, climb down a thousand-foot-deep valley, cross a rushing mountain stream, and then climb up a thousand-foot-high mountain wall to reach the railway fence leading to the factory. As long as there was a hint of warning, the entire area would be lit up by searchlights.

Extremely Dangerous

At eight o'clock in the morning on February 27th, nine people set off. Carrying sensitive explosives, wading through deep valleys and cliffs was extremely difficult. Melting ice filled the rushing stream. Fortunately, they finally found a small ice bridge, which allowed them to pass safely. Then they began to climb the rock. Lonnie, the leader of the team, kept looking at his watch, allowing little time for delay. In this way, they climbed up this thousand-foot-high cliff inch by inch. These Norwegians knew that one slip would be the end of everything.

Finally reaching the top, they crawled forward along the railway fence with their greatest effort. Now they were only five hundred feet away from the factory. They could already hear the rumbling of the machines. Lonnie made a final quiet discussion with everyone to make sure that everyone understood their respective tasks. "It's time," he finally said. One of the men, taking a sharp steel shear, went over first. Then came the low sound of the steel lock breaking. The rest of the men immediately and nimbly followed through the steel bucket. Five men with Thompson guns quietly surrounded the barracks where twelve German soldiers lived. If there was an alarm, the German soldiers would be shot to death as soon as they came out.

Thanks to Dr. Tronstad's precise training, Lonnie's four demolition teams crossed the winding passages in a few minutes and found the high-pressure room.

The guard there was suddenly startled by two guns protruding from the dark ceiling wall. He had no choice but to obey. Lonnie skillfully wrapped the machine and the heavy water tank together and tied on the bomb—something he had trained in England, so he knew which things were most easily damaged. At this time, the other team members had also completed their deployment and arrived here.

The alarm had not sounded yet. Lonnie lit a thirty-second fuse and turned around to tell the guard (he was Norwegian) to escape. They had escaped twenty yards from the house when they heard a deafening explosion.

Alarm

As the alarm echoed across the sky, drowsy German soldiers rushed out with their guns. Lonnie and his men had already returned along the difficult and steep route that the German soldiers seemed unable to fly across. At this time, the tank broke and a thousand pounds of priceless heavy water flowed into the gutter.

In less than a few hours, German Commander General Falkenhorst rushed to Vermork. After inspecting, he declared: "This is the most severe destruction I have ever seen." He issued an order to gather an entire German force of more than 12,000 men in the area. Ski patrols and slowly flying reconnaissance planes searched the mountains. All roads and mountain paths were blocked, and Nazi and stormtroopers searched residents door to door. But these attackers were nowhere to be found.

Five of the "Marksman" team members had quickly skied across the Swedish border and safely returned to London. The sixth, Poncha, stayed with four "Finch" team members to handle other underground work. They played a game of hide-and-seek with Falkenhorst's patrols on sleds.

Aino retreated to his small hut, telegraphed the results of the explosion, and continued to watch Norsk Hydro.

Success

In the winter of 1943, Aino telegraphed that the damage had been repaired and the factory had resumed production. A bomber squadron of the US Eighth Air Force immediately bombed the factory's power station. So the Germans decided to move all the heavy water manufacturing equipment and the manufactured heavy water from Norsk Hydro to an underground factory site in Germany. These materials were scheduled to be loaded onto trucks and carried by the railway ferry "Hydro" across Lake Tinn. Aino requested headquarters to allow him to sink the "Hydro." The promise came quickly, and Aino immediately ordered Poncha to come. At that time, Poncha was in a Norwegian underground organization fifty miles away. He mixed on the ship to arrange a fart by forging documents posing as a Norsk Hydro employee. Just before the boat sailed shortly before, he put in a time bomb.

A few days later, the last batch of German heavy water had sunk to the bottom of Lake Tinnsjø. Hitler's plan to build an atomic bomb was delayed and then stalled. They had to turn to the manufacture of other new weapons. But we—the people of the Allied countries, will always be grateful to these eleven brave Norwegians. (The end)

Shanghai Cross-Section

### Organization of Beggars 3

— Huang Jiamo

Each bucket is presided over by a "Uncle" generation, and also accommodates from five or six to more than ten of the younger generation. Too many people will not be able to accommodate themselves, and too few will be weak and insufficient to resist foreign insults. Only when the uncle has occupied the bucket can the problem of food and lodging be solved. Then they began to develop their power and worked hard to "scrape money." First, they put their minds into the surrounding section of the bucket. The first step was to bow and make a smiling face to the shop owners and vendors. The meaning is, "I am the new servant sent to manage this area. Please take care of me, big boss." So every New Year's holiday, celebration day, and even funeral day, the uncle can ask the store for rewards. The second step is to start investigating the "household registration" of each household in the jurisdiction. In fact, the purpose is not the household registration, but the reality of whether they are rich or poor. What kind of brokerage, whether there are secret deals, or what grudges they have with whom, etc. Because these people are afraid that the world will not be in chaos. They most hope that people will have quarrels or conflicts, and they can participate in them and get profits. The third step is to investigate how many stores in the territory provide packed lunches, and how many packed lunches are carried by shop assistants every day. Because "cold rice" belongs to them.

Attack on Vendors

Chinese shops have always been charitable and generous. In addition to responding to requests on weekdays, they give even more rewards during festivals. Especially the street vendors, in order not to make enemies with these old brothers, often pay the rewards with pain. All of these are the main income of the uncles in this section. Gathering a little can make a lot, and the amount is quite considerable. In addition to taking out a part as a reward for the younger generation, most of it goes into their own pockets. Therefore, whoever occupies the "bucket" can be successful in all directions and not worry about the source of income being cut off. As for daily meals, the younger ghosts will naturally respect them with stolen cold rice. Therefore, the bucket is really the lifeblood of the beggar gang, just like a place that soldiers must compete for.

The beggar gang asks shops and vendors for money, which has accumulated over the years. In the eyes of the merchants, it is a kind of unjustified money, but the beggar gang is very respectful and pretends to be paid voluntarily by the merchants. If other gangsters plot against the merchants, the old brothers will come out righteously and fight for justice on their behalf. In fact, those gangsters are originally in collusion with the gang, nominally protecting them, but in fact it is a disguised form of blackmail. But if the merchants refuse to give rewards, the old brothers will come up with all kinds of tricks and play with the vendors in every way, inciting other gangsters to take the opportunity to bully them.

If it is a food stall, they will gather to eat and leave without paying a penny, or pour kerosene on the stall items, unless the vendors are forced to pay in fear of difficulty. According to the spokesperson of the gang, this is really because the territory is difficult to occupy. If they show weakness to certain vendors once, it will lead other merchants to compete to follow suit and cut off the beggar gang's lifeline. Therefore, they have to "do everything possible to achieve the effect of punishing one as a warning to a hundred." If the merchants call the police and chase after them, it will be of no avail. Because the patrols of the "concession" in the past were most troubled by these "gangs." These people regard the police station as a hotel, and they have food and lodging in the detention center, and they don't think it is a hardship. The foreign adults in the police station are not willing to let these dirty old brothers pollute their clean cells.

### The Carriage Is Society

— Suo Bei

There is nothing better than the current Shanghai carriage to describe today's society. Inside there is: squeezing (exclusion), crushing (infighting), corruption (taking advantage), secret theft (pickpocket), open theft (not buying tickets), fraud (insufficient ticket purchase), abuse of power (the car does not stop at the station), disregard for human life (the car drives away when passengers are getting off or on), and selfishness (smoking).

Looking at the carriage and then looking at society, I don't think the strangeness of today's society is surprising. Looking at society and then looking at the carriage, I think it is inevitable.

### A Trite Saying

— Hong Guo

In today's cities, everyone is busy with life problems and busy chasing fame and fortune. I don't know how many people lack not vitamins but exercise.

Exercise, sports, this familiar and vulgar slogan, was promoted to us when we were in elementary school, but to this day, I don't know how many people have suffered a similar loss: no exercise!

If there is really an omnipotent tonic in the world, that tonic is: continuous and appropriate exercise!

### Chinese and Foreign Words

— Guo Hong

Once a foreign friend said the following words to me:

"You Chinese have some difficult-to-describe humor, and often use life as a capital for humor. For example, eating! Many people have a table of dishes, Zhang San uses chopsticks, Li Si uses a spoon, turning the soup into dishwater; turning delicacies into piles of saliva, and even knowing that there are people with T.B. or other infectious diseases at the table, they still don't care. Once I couldn't stand it anymore and advised them to implement a separate eating system—this has long been implemented in our country. They perfunctorily answered me, but behind my back they were saying 'We Chinese don't need the same hygiene as foreigners'!"

Weekly Chat: How to Spend Sunday?

### Small Government Employee

— Liu Sui

Sunday, for us small government employees, is like a pill coated with sugar, or a licorice tea that cannot stimulate any effect.

To say Sunday is like a pill is because it inherently carries a strong bitter taste. The bitter life of a government employee is fated, struggling to make ends meet, living from hand to mouth, the pace of years is arduous and melancholic, like a long and weary journey. Of course, one longs for way stations along the journey, and Sunday is the way station; this way station is the sugar coating outside the pill, the sugar coating can always give you a brief temptation and comfort. However, the erosion of the sugar coating is still the continuation of bitterness, just as after you enjoy the Sunday, you still have to step back into that eternally weary journey of life with trembling and shrinking feelings.

To say Sunday is like licorice tea is because it itself cannot make you taste the joy of replenishment and recovery. Chinese medicine prescriptions cannot lack the accompaniment of licorice, just as our lives cannot lack the embellishment of Sunday. Licorice varies in its function due to the properties of the medicine, and Sunday also varies in sweetness and sourness depending on people's wealth; the movie theaters on Sunday raise their prices, and the parks on Sunday are filled with leisurely people. It's better to just stay at home! But what is there to linger for at home? Desolate walls, even the sunlight is melancholic, lonely and desolate, and leisure will only aggravate your fantasies. Like lightly sipping a cup of licorice tea, just a wisp of sweetness, the chronic illness of your life will definitely not improve because of this.

The life of a small government employee is a pool of eternal still water, and Sunday is just an occasional ripple in the still water; the ripple cannot stir up the waves of the still water, and Sunday will not bring us the rare joy of life.

### The Little Soldiers

— Da Bing

"One, two, three, four! "Forward march!" The days passed too boringly.

The monotonous and dull military camp life makes us look forward to the arrival of Sunday every day, but Sunday is not necessarily ours, if we are not on duty or in service, we can only go out once or twice a month to take a breather.

It's strange to say, it's rare for us to come out and have fun, and many people seem to dislike our rare outing. When they see us in the theater, they put on a helpless look, their hospitality to the national army is not on Sunday. When buying tickets on the tram, the passengers seem to wink and make faces behind our backs. When we go to the store to buy something, the clerks speak to you in Mandarin in a strange tone, the more you don't understand, the more they want to talk to you, and I really can't hold back a fire in my heart. Just as I was about to raise my hand, I felt only a little over a thousand dollars in my pocket, with a large stack of ten-dollar bills. Forget it, I don't blame them!

Sunday passed so quickly, and after strolling on the road for two hours, it was already dusk. Thinking of the slow pace during drill practice, I was so angry that I wanted to cry. Heaven also likes to make fun of us.

Sunday seems like a shadow on our bodies, we can't catch it, and we can't let it go. It's always so numb, and extremely sad. I really want to beat it up!

### The King Without Evenings

— Hong Yin

I often say: "Journalists seem to have every day as Sunday, but in reality, 365 days have no Sunday." But in the former era of the Municipal Council, when anti-Japanese newspapers were fined and suspended, it was an unexpected vacation. Now, the times no longer allow me to rest. Even the New Year's Eve and the New Year this year, I am afraid that the newspapers will not necessarily suspend publication. Last National Day, the newspapers were still published.

Sunday, this "lovely" day, is not important to us who are nervous day and night in interviewing or scissors and paste. If it is said that newspapermen have Sundays and holidays, then those who work outside should sleep all day to relax their nerves, and those who work inside should sleep all night on Saturday night and bask in the sun all day on Sunday.
