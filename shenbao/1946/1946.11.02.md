### Government Representatives Meet with the Chairman; U.S. Ambassador Remains in Nanjing Awaiting New Developments in the Situation

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Government representatives Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu were summoned by the Chairman at 7:30 PM on the 1st to report on everything. Hu Lin also met with the Chairman at 4 PM. U.S. Ambassador Stuart was also present. They researched the prospects for peace talks. Hu visited Stuart at 11 PM. Mo Dehui visited the U.S. Ambassador and talked for two hours. In the afternoon, the Democratic League and social figures continued to hold meetings. After the meeting, Liang Shuming visited Zhou Enlai.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] According to a certain authoritative source, any form of negotiation at present seems unable to affect the established opinions insisted upon by the Communist Party, and it is not easy to find a way to solve the problem. The government will still proceed according to the Chairman's instructions, such as convening a military three-person meeting, an informal five-person group, and reviewing the draft constitution.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social figures suggested changing the form of peace talks, with direct talks between the KMT and the CCP and mediation by the Democratic League, etc., which is the so-called informal comprehensive talks with three parties participating. Another method is to convene a Political Consultative Conference comprehensive group. This suggestion still changes the form without changing the content. According to the spokesperson of the CCP delegation on the morning of the 1st, the crux of the matter is still the three points of immediate and unconditional ceasefire, reorganization of the National Government, and submission of the list of National Assembly representatives. The principles will not be changed, and no matter how the form changes, no agreement can be reached. The spokesperson also insisted that the Communist Party urgently demands an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. At the same time, the reorganization of the National Government should include the Executive Yuan, and the list of National Assembly representatives must be submitted to the reorganized National Government. The National Assembly must be convened after all consultations.

[Report from the United Press, Nanjing, 1st] According to a certain government official tonight, direct negotiations between the KMT and the CCP with leaders of third parties present will begin soon. The ultimate fate of the negotiations depends on the developments in the next ten days.

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 1st] The U.S. Ambassador was originally scheduled to fly to Beiping this morning, but it was temporarily cancelled. According to those around the Ambassador, the Ambassador hopes that there will be new developments in the situation, so he stayed in Nanjing to maintain contact with all parties.

[Report from the Central News Agency, This City] Youth Party representatives Zeng Qi, Li Huang, and Democratic League representative Huang Yanpei arrived in Shanghai by train on the morning of the 1st.

Wang only brought five staff members in charge of taking over. He also ordered the incumbent Director of Civil Affairs Liu Daoyuan to represent the provincial government's secretary-general to take over. After a rest, they toasted each other. At 9:00, the seal handover ceremony was held. He and Wang delivered speeches, and Pang Jingtang delivered a speech on behalf of the guests.

### Main Force of Communist Army in Rehe Enters Territory; Artillery War Breaks Out Again in Eastern Hebei; National Army in Northern Section of Pinghan Railway Moves South in Two Routes

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 1st] The main force of the Communist army in eastern Hebei, after being defeated by the National Army and driven away, scattered in the countryside. Small groups have recently reassembled, attempting to destroy the hinterland of the Beining Railway. At 9:00 PM on October 29th, the National Army stationed near Qian'an and in the triangular area of Luan County, Lulong, and Qian'an was suddenly attacked by the Communist army. The two sides engaged in fierce artillery battles. As of the 30th, the sound of artillery fire was still rumbling. After a period of silence, the flames of war in eastern Hebei have begun to spread. According to reports, some of the main force of the Communist army has been transferred from Rehe and is eager to show its strength. It is generally believed that ensuring the safe operation of the Beining Railway and firmly defending the points and lines is important, and the northern side is particularly important. Currently, the commander of the National Army division is stationed at Leizhuang Station on the Beining Railway, commanding his troops in combat. The commander of the Eastern Hebei Pacification Command, Hou Jingru, has set up a command post in Tangshan and will begin active work in the near future. In addition, Commander Sun Lianzhong of the Eleventh War Zone, in order to understand the situation of all party, government, and military measures in the counties of eastern Hebei after repeated recovery, and to plan for reorganization and improvement, has sent commissioners to inspect.

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 1st] There was no major change in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway on the 1st. According to the headquarters, a certain division of the 53rd Army on the right wing and the 94th Army on the front have joined forces in the same city. They have now moved south in two routes with the National Army in Xincheng on the left wing. As of 6:00 PM on the 1st, there was no news of reaching Xushui. The Communist army is heavily concentrated between Xushui and Caohe. According to reports, a brigade of the Communist army's field army has opened near Gaoqiao, the 385th Brigade has been transferred to near Caohe, Liuzhuang, and more than 3,000 from the Independent Eighth Brigade are stationed in Fangliang Town, southeast of Xushui. Liu Bingzhang's unit of more than 1,000 opened near Zangcun on the 28th. A certain military observer said that although the total number of Communist troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is not 100,000, there are indeed 40,000 to 50,000. Affected by regional warfare, the National Army is far inferior to the Communist Army in number. Therefore, the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has not yet been able to join forces. Commander Sun Lianzhong, for practical needs, has sent personnel to Zhuozhou to actively strengthen the strength of the local team, so as to cooperate with the National Army in combat. The situation between Baoding and Shijiazhuang has not changed. On the 1st, a certain agency broadcast news that the National Army had entered Handan, but the headquarters has not been able to confirm this news.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Baoding, 1st] A thousand soldiers of the 4th Brigade of the Communist Field Army forcibly crossed the Hutuo River north of Huolu's Lizhang Town last night, with unclear intentions.

### He Long's Tens of Thousands of Troops Move Westward from Northern Shanxi

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 1st] Tens of thousands of He Long's troops have moved westward from northern Shanxi.

It is reported that more than 10,000 of He's troops have moved from Hunyuan to Yanlan, west of Ying County, another 5,000 have been transferred to Guangwu, and another 6,000 have moved west through Loukou. In addition, more than 1,000 Communist troops near Ying County and the 13th and 14th Regiments are preparing scaling ladders, seemingly about to take new action.

A unit of more than 500 men from the 9th Column of the Communist Army's Central China Field Army recently defected to the National Army with their weapons in Chenjiaji, thirty miles southwest of Huaiyin.

### Unity of Business Circles at Home and Abroad; Inauguration of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry; Chairman Chiang Issues Instructions Encouraging the Assembly

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The inaugural meeting of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry was solemnly opened at the Union Recreation Club of this unit at 9:30 AM on the 1st. Three hundred and twenty-one representatives from forty-three units at home and abroad attended. Shanghai representatives Wang Yansong, Jin Runxiang, etc. arrived before the meeting. Government leaders who participated included President Song's representative Wang Xuewu, and Chen Lifu, Chen Shuren, Ma Chaojun, Gu Zhenggang, etc. The ceremony was conducted as follows: Chairman Wang Yaolai delivered a speech, saying: The Federation of Commerce and Industry is a comprehensive organization of the national industrial and commercial circles, which is still an innovation in the history of our country. The enthusiastic participation of representatives from all over the country, uniting as one, is truly commendable. It is even more gratifying that compatriots who are focusing on embracing the motherland and compatriots from the Northeast who have learned valuable lessons from fourteen years of suffering have gathered here. Our task is arduous. The urgent problems at present are to determine economic policies and save the industrial and commercial crisis. Not only do all regions expect this association to find ways to coordinate and solve these problems, but the government also hopes that this association can provide practical suggestions. I hope that the delegates will contribute valuable opinions. After the speech, the Chairman's instructions were announced (summary): "Your association is convening its inaugural meeting on November 1st this year, bringing together representatives of industry and commerce from provinces and cities across the country to review gains and losses and seek countermeasures for the present situation, in order to gather ideas and benefit from them. It is truly a grand event. I would like to share several matters with you for mutual encouragement: In the Industrial Plan, the National Father once pointed out that in order to maintain world peace, we should prevent commercial wars and then eradicate wars of force, and said: "I also want international cooperation to help China's development, so as to avoid future trade wars." Although today's world situation is constantly evolving, the National Father's practical instructions are still a timely compass. I deeply hope that our country's industrial and commercial circles will inherit this intention, recognize the current situation, and seek development, so as to become a stable force in international commercial competition, so as to enhance the glory of the national history. The victory of the War of Resistance has only just begun. Due to the difficulty of things, industry and commerce cannot show a prosperous scene. How should we promote them in the future? It must be in your careful consideration. For example, how to stabilize prices so that they do not affect social life? How to use wandering funds so that they focus on production? In particular, how to improve domestic products so that they reach the level of self-sufficiency? As for how to control the sales of foreign goods so that they can regulate materials without hindering the industrial and commercial distribution. All of these are what the government has been thinking about day and night, but in order to achieve satisfactory results, we still rely on the power of society to support us. You are models of the industrial and commercial circles, and at this gathering, I hope that you will thoroughly discuss the situation and exert your outstanding vision, so that industry and commerce can be revitalized in time to help the success of national construction. This is what I earnestly hope for, Zhongzheng's government has merchants." (More news about the Federation of Commerce and Industry, please see page 2.)

### National Federation of Commerce and Industry General Assembly Passes Resolution Supporting Chairman's Eight Proposals, Designates November 1st as Merchants' Day, Representatives from Various Regions Bitterly Complain of Serious Industrial and Commercial Crisis

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The National Federation of Commerce and Industry held its first general assembly at 3:30 PM on the 1st. Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported on the preparation process, followed by discussions and resolutions: (1) Sending a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay tribute; (2) Submitting a telegram to Chairman Chiang endorsing eight proposals, such as convening the National Assembly as scheduled and implementing constitutional government; (3) Passing the proposal of the Guizhou representative to designate November 1st as Merchants' Day. Representatives from various regions then reported on the situation of the Commerce and Industry Federations and the current situation of industry and commerce in their respective regions. The first to report was Shanghai representative Luo Qinghua, who said: The industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai is similar to that in other places in the country, all in a serious crisis and approaching collapse. The main pressures are three: (1) High interest rates: Due to the government's adoption of inflation and financial tightening, legitimate businesses are unable to obtain loans and have to pay high interest rates of 18% or 20% in the black market, suffocating industry; (2) High wages: Shanghai's cost of living has increased by 4,800 to 5,000 times. Workers' base salaries have also increased, so workers' salaries have increased more than 20,000 times compared to before, increasing production costs, and labor disputes continue to occur; (3) Foreign goods are dumped in our country, and Shanghai is the first to bear the brunt, and commerce is declining day by day. Due to the above three reasons, the industrial and commercial crisis is becoming more and more serious. In July of this year, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other groups formed a petition group to come to Beijing. Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council also formed a petition group to petition the central government. The former has been instructed by the government, but it has not touched the real source of the disease, nor has it proposed relief measures to address the crisis. The Shanghai representatives have put forward a variety of specific suggestions and hope that they can be resolved at this grand meeting.

Zhejiang representative Zhu Huiqing reported, briefly stating: Due to the impact of the war in Zhejiang Province, production facilities have been almost completely destroyed, and production has shrunk. Silk production is less than one-third of that before the war, and tea is less than half, and the future is worrying.

Xikang representative Sun Jiangjian reported, saying: Xikang is indeed a barren land, but the underground is rich in deposits. I hope you can pay attention to the southwest and develop the deposits.

Tianjin representative Liu Xisan reported that Tianjin needs a huge amount of dredging fees every year due to the Haihe River problem, which hinders transportation and is extremely inconvenient. I hope that the Tanggu New Port can be completed as soon as possible. This is not only a blessing for Tianjin, but also a benefit for the entire North China.

The Mexican representative delivered a speech, hoping to develop overseas commerce, and suggested organizing a shipping company to sail to North and South America to carry our country's special products such as silk and tea and exchange them for foreign gold, silver, and banknotes to return to the country. The most suffering of the overseas Chinese in Mexico is that they cannot return to their country after making a fortune overseas. I hope you can pay attention to this point, and emphasize the importance of compatriots at home and abroad working together. The speech was impassioned and won a lot of applause.

Jiangsu representative Lu Xiaobo reported that the people have experienced the war and the War of Resistance, which can be said to be riddled with holes. After that, there was a currency devaluation of 200 to 1, which made the people even more wounded. The takeover work was also not satisfactory. Materials were either rotten or broken, and some even disappeared. It is painful to say this. The war damage suffered by northern Jiangsu is even more indescribable. Light industries with fragile foundations in terms of industry and commerce have been collapsing due to the lack of funds and the dumping of foreign goods. Commerce is also suffering unspeakable pain due to heavy taxes.

Representatives from Fujian, Shanxi, Sichuan, Anhui, and other places also gave brief reports. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. The second general assembly will be held on the morning of the 2nd to continue listening to reports.

### Premier Song's Address: More Than Policy Decisions, Action Is Essential

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Premier Song's address to the Federation of Commerce stated, in full: The inaugural meeting of the Republic of China Federation of Commerce is being held in the capital. Due to official duties, Ziwen is unable to attend this grand occasion in person, which I deeply regret. I hereby entrust Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to convey my congratulations and briefly express my humble opinions as follows: Since the victory, transportation in various regions has been disrupted, production has declined, tax revenue is difficult to collect, budgets are unbalanced, materials are scarce, and prices are soaring, leading to frequent labor strikes and social unrest, resulting in a situation of hardship and crisis. The Executive Yuan, in overseeing all administrative matters, bears an inescapable responsibility. It has directed the relevant ministries to plan and implement measures in various aspects, including restoring transportation, increasing material production, rectifying various taxes, utilizing enemy and puppet assets, opening up foreign trade, adjusting foreign exchange rates, and mediating labor-management disputes, aiming to address both immediate and fundamental issues, simplify complexity, and gradually achieve the effect of stabilizing prices and improving people's livelihoods. However, eliminating today's economic crisis involves myriad complex issues and requires comprehensive planning. The above measures are merely emergency responses and not fundamental solutions. The attendees of the Federation of Commerce are all leaders of industry and commerce from various regions, and their observations on the current hardships of the industrial and commercial sectors are undoubtedly profound. If they can seize this valuable opportunity, use their keen observations to conduct thorough research and discussion together, and generate concrete proposals to guide policy implementation, the government will certainly do its utmost to meet their earnest expectations. Furthermore, economic issues are closely interconnected, and the government and the people are inseparable. National impoverishment naturally leads to depleted resources, while national wealth must begin with enriching the people. Overcoming today's difficulties requires not only the government's efforts but also the self-awareness and self-governance of industrialists and businessmen, unity of purpose, endurance of hardship, and concerted cooperation to achieve success. The Federation of Commerce is the highest organization of the industrial and commercial sectors nationwide. How it will lead the industry, assist the government, promote economic laws and regulations, and promote industrial and commercial development in the future is the most serious issue. It is hoped that the attendees will share the difficulties of the times, maintain unwavering loyalty, not only make policy decisions but also demonstrate action, to overcome the current crisis, strive for future development, and further secure the country on a foundation of stability, and elevate the people to a state of well-being and happiness. Then today's meeting will truly be related to the rise and fall, prosperity and decline of the nation and the people. I cannot help but place my hopes on it.

### Speeches by Government Leaders: Gu Zhenggang Encourages with Three Matters, Wang Yunwu Urges Attention to Three Points

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Chen Lifu's speech at the National Federation of Commerce stated, in brief: The establishment of the Federation of Commerce signifies a great spiritual unity of Chinese merchants and marks a new era in commercial history. With the victory of the War of Resistance and the beginning of national construction, the responsibility of merchants is even greater. I hope they can strengthen themselves, increase internal and external connections, thereby enhancing the welfare of merchants and contributing to the country. After the speech, Premier Song delegated Wang Yunwu to deliver an address (see above).

Following that, Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech, encouraging the representatives with three matters: (1) To seek the sound development of industry and commerce through a sound industrial and commercial organization. The conference should solemnly select directors and supervisors, pay attention to the selection of personnel and regional distribution, and strengthen domestic and overseas connections to rescue the economic crisis; (2) The demands of industry and commerce should be mutually adapted to the government's economic policies. When reviewing industrial and commercial interests, attention should be paid to the overall national interest; (3) To solve problems, one should not only solve the proposals.

Wang Yunwu's speech stated, in brief: In this era of organized economics, the importance of the Federation of Commerce is self-evident. It is hoped that it can have a long-term vision, act in accordance with laws and regulations, consider the national interest, seek economic recovery, and pay attention to the following points: (1) The purpose of the Federation of Commerce is to facilitate the flow of goods and compete in the international market, which is extremely important. Since the recovery, imports have significantly exceeded exports. Encouraging exports is a consistent government policy, but it also relies heavily on the efforts of industry and commerce. Adjustments to foreign exchange rates, exemptions from export tariffs, and subsidy policies for export businesses have been implemented in order. It is hoped that industry and commerce can also make their own efforts to rescue the crisis. (2) It is hoped that they will continuously improve their technical management knowledge to complete industrial construction. (3) Strengthening the organization itself will not only increase its own interests but also benefit the national economy.

Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, stated, in brief: Overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the development of foreign trade. It is hoped that overseas Chinese can invest more in the country, conduct more inspections, and strengthen connections with domestic industry and commerce. At the same time, it is hoped that domestic compatriots can also travel overseas for tourism.

### Central Cooperative Treasury Opens for Business Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Central Cooperative Treasury held its opening ceremony at its new location at 9:00 AM on the 1st.

### Agricultural Bank Holds Administrative Meeting: Chairman Issues Instructions, Indicating Current Fundamental Priorities

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The fifth administrative meeting of the Chinese Farmers Bank was held at the bank's headquarters at 9:00 AM today. A total of 91 people attended, including Chairman Chen Guofu, Standing Directors Chen Qicai and Wu Tiecheng, Supervisor Wang Xicun, General Manager Li Shuming, heads of various departments of the headquarters, and managers of branches across the country. The meeting was chaired by Li Shuming, who first read the instructions from Chairman Chiang, Premier Song, and Minister Yu Hongjun. Chen Qicai then gave a speech, encouraging the bank to provide as much assistance as possible to the restoration of rural businesses in various provinces, especially in the development of agricultural production and processing. Wu Tiecheng stated: The Agricultural Bank has always strived to implement the Party's agricultural policies. In the future, its mission to revitalize rural areas, promote economic construction, and complete the Three Principles of the People will be even more significant. Li Shuming pointed out that the Agricultural Bank's mission in the future will be to take responsibility for revitalizing agricultural finance and achieving rural industrialization. Chen Guofu emphasized that the Agricultural Bank's business should penetrate deep into rural areas and pay close attention to actual needs in the future. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, and all personnel went to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for a memorial service. The first plenary session was held in the afternoon, with heads of various departments of the headquarters presenting work reports.

The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is recorded below: "Farmers in our country account for 80 percent of the total population, but agricultural production and the rural economy have so far stagnated in the outdated methods of the Middle Ages and have rarely been improved. This not only impoverishes the lives of all the people but also causes the construction of the entire country to stagnate. Therefore, although national construction today is a complex undertaking, improving agricultural production and enriching the rural economy, so that they can adapt to the steps of modern science, is the most fundamental and priority task at present. How can we improve production? Mechanization of cultivation is the most urgent priority. How can we enrich the economy? Rural industrialization is particularly important. These are both the greatest responsibilities of this bank in the future, and it is also a major policy of this bank to transform the past passive work of rural relief into the active work of rural construction. It is deeply hoped that all comrades at this administrative meeting will recognize the goals, broaden their horizons, open up new paths for business, and establish effective plans to complete this epoch-making mission, and live up to the original intention of Zhongzheng (Chiang's given name) in establishing this bank. I have great expectations."

Currently, these two obstacles are gradually disappearing. Health administration should immediately plan to expand its work and strive for construction. Therefore, this meeting is convened to discuss the following matters: (1) Changes in the financial system and reduced provincial income will inevitably affect health administration, which is based on the province as a unit. How should we find ways to solve the funding problem? (2) Expansion of frontier health administration and medical equipment; (3) Establishing uniform standards for business, eliminating the situation where each unit acts on its own, jointly preventing and controlling epidemics, and improving people's livelihoods; (4) The supply and distribution of national medicines, and the cultivation and regulation of talent; (5) The utilization of relief materials and their coordination with various social undertakings, etc. I sincerely hope that the participants will brainstorm and discuss enthusiastically, so that health administration can have a high degree of development and reach perfection, in order to achieve the important task of saving the people and strengthening the race." After Jin's speech, he read the Chairman's instructions, indicating that health work should not be merely limited to passive treatment but must actively promote healthcare.

Editorial

### The Subtle State of the Chinese Situation

The Chinese situation today has truly entered a state of "subtlety"! Can it be said to be bright? Shadows are clearly present, not only shadows, but also layers of clouds and mist that seem to be rushing out from the mountain valleys. Can it be said to be dark? The signs of a major thunderstorm of the past three or four months seem to have passed, and the clouds and mist seem to have dissipated a lot in the past half month. Furthermore, seeing the atmosphere of universal joy and celebration among the people on the Chairman's birthday the day before yesterday, everyone will be able to recognize where the true public opinion lies and where the hopes for China's future rest. A bright future, how can one close one's eyes and deny it? The Chinese situation is currently on the edge of darkness and light, perhaps like the dawn after a long night.

Let us look back at the developments in the situation over the past month, which can truly be described as a sudden rise and fall, magnificent and imposing. Since the CCP's statement on July 30, demanding a ceasefire in Zhangjiakou, otherwise considering the peace talks to have broken down, the situation was almost at a dead end. Although the suggestion from Envoy Marshall for a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou was agreed to by the government, the CCP resolutely rejected it, and the situation moved even closer to the brink. Fortunately, the Chairman's National Day broadcast expressed that the government always hoped for sincere negotiations, and the door to peace talks remained wide open. When the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou on the 11th, the government ordered the National Assembly to convene as scheduled on November 12, and the situation seemed to indicate a storm was coming. However, through the efforts of various parties, factions, and social elites, on the 16th, the Chairman issued a public statement, presenting eight strategies for handling the situation, which then led to the entry of CCP representatives and representatives of other parties and factions into Beijing on the 21st. The resentment gradually dissipated, and peace could be achieved. At this point, the situation should have taken a turn for the better. However, the ten days cannot be said to be too short, but the atmosphere in the capital only lingered in informal individual talks, and even bored to the point of first discussing a publicity truce, without touching on concrete major issues, resulting in wasted time. Even the opportunity for the government and CCP representatives to sit together at the negotiating table and reveal the final card was not created, which is regrettable. According to the news as of yesterday, the government has made extremely great concessions, only hoping that the various parties can present the list of National Assembly representatives, and the government will order a ceasefire. Regarding the other points in the Chairman's statement on the 16th, even after the National Assembly convenes, they can be discussed. The government is willing to continue to make political and military concessions. We believe that all parties should be satisfied, and the situation can take a sharp turn for the better and suddenly see the light. Who would have known that the CCP spokesman again expressed resolute rejection, and some of the so-called "third party" mediators have also left Beijing one after another, although denying the rumors of withdrawing from mediation, and even suggesting a non-official comprehensive forum composed of various parties, but it cannot be denied that the Chinese situation is still stagnating in the "dragging" stage. However, the date for the convening of the National Assembly is only ten days away, and the government's choice of politics for the people does not allow it to lose faith in the people. Dragging it out cannot be prolonged any further! From this tortuous Chinese situation, "talking" may not necessarily lead to success at the moment, but "fighting" may not necessarily lead to a quick victory in the future, and the Chinese situation has indeed entered a stage where a solution must be urgently sought. This is where the "subtlety" of the Chinese situation lies!

To resolve this subtle situation, we have always believed that the government should stand in a proactive position and take responsibility for the country and the people—not only take responsibility for the current situation, but also take historical responsibility. The government should enable the people to at least live and work in peace, and therefore the government must be responsible for truly unifying the country and ensuring lasting peace. If the government can accomplish this task at this time, later historians will give a fair judgment. If the CCP does not understand the responsibility that history has given to the Chinese government at this time and attempts to obstruct the true unification and lasting peace of the country, the people will naturally give a fair judgment. It must be known that China belongs to the Chinese people, and not just to a certain party or faction. At this time, please do not only know that you are the first party, the CCP is the second party, and a certain party or faction is the third, fourth, or fifth party. You must broaden your horizons to see the people of the whole country. No party should boast of being a "party" but should obey the public opinion of the people. We believe that the day the government can recognize the people's wishes and respect the people's power is the day the Chinese situation can move from subtlety to brightness.

The CCP's lack of sincerity in peace talks is not something that started today. The government should not close the door to peace talks because of the CCP's lack of sincerity, but it cannot continue to fall into the abyss of empty talk with those who are insincere! What we would like to point out to the government is that the CCP has no intention of peace, but the representatives of other parties and factions, the elites without party affiliation, and even the people of the whole country hope for peace, and are just as eager as the government. The government should grasp this point. At this time, make some major expressions of its own initiative, so that the representatives of various parties and factions, those without party affiliation, and even the people of the whole country, and even future generations, can believe that the government truly has the sincerity for peaceful unification. Then the government can be worthy of the country and the people. The excuses that the CCP is currently holding on to are a ceasefire and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). Let us try to borrow a plan for the government: the government can solemnly issue an order to automatically declare a ceasefire in place, as long as the communist troops no longer harass and attack, it will never use military force, and everything will be left for negotiation and resolution; secondly, announce the list of National Assembly members and reorganize the National Government Committee. Both of these should follow the PCC resolutions, reserving the number of participants from all parties in proportion, to await the emergence of representatives from the CCP and other parties. As soon as the representatives are nominated, the National Government can immediately announce it so that everyone can participate in the National Assembly and the National Government Committee. These two measures can be carried out simultaneously. The former can express the government's sincerity in seeking peace, and the latter can express the government's desire to always wait for all parties to jointly participate in the National Assembly and the government to achieve national unification. We believe that if the government is truly sincere and practical, it can not only be understood by the representatives of various parties and factions, the elites without party affiliation, and even the people of the whole country, but even if the CCP stubbornly clings to its party's prejudices, it will lose the sympathy of the Chinese people and friendly countries in the world. If the government is so tolerant and the CCP still refuses to participate in the National Assembly, or even obstructs other parties from participating in the National Assembly, then the CCP will eventually abandon itself.

How to dispel the clouds and see the light in the subtle Chinese situation depends on how the government fulfills its responsibilities.

### Tianjin Uncovers Drug Trafficking Case; Principal Culprit is an Official of the Enemy Property Administration Bureau

[Our Tianjin Dispatch] The Tianjin Municipal Police Bureau cracked another drug trafficking case on October 24th, seizing a total of 43 catties and 4 liang of opium and 23.8 million yuan in funds. The main culprits in the case included two incumbent civil servants: Li Jia Chi, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Government and commissioner of the Hebei-Pingjin District Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, and Mao Xing, a staff member of the Potassium Bureau of the Enemy Property Administration. All relevant suspects have been apprehended by the police bureau. The details are as follows:

October 24th was the day for traffic regulation by the 10th Police Sub-bureau. At around 4 p.m., while regulating traffic near Fusun Lane in the Huangjia Garden area under its jurisdiction, the police officers on duty noticed a pedicab speeding by, violating traffic rules. They stopped it for questioning, but the passenger in the pedicab suddenly changed color and appeared flustered. The police officers suspected him and immediately searched him, finding four large packages of opium in his briefcase. After his concealment was exposed, the passenger attempted to bribe the inspecting officers with 10 million yuan, hoping to escape the law. The officers sternly refused and took him to the sub-bureau for interrogation.

The suspect confessed that his name was Liu Jincai, and that the opium had been introduced by his friends Zhang Mazi and Xu Amao. He had purchased it from Li Jia Chi's residence for 60,000 yuan per liang, intending to transport it to Shanghai for sale. He had already paid a check for 10 million yuan from the Zhenxingchang Bank and a postal money order for 10 million yuan at Li's residence. Based on Liu's confession, the police bureau immediately arrested all relevant suspects that day: Li Jia Chi, the current commissioner of the Enemy Property Administration Bureau; Mao Xing, a staff member; Sun Zhou Shi, the owner of the opium; Xiao Changyou, Li's servant; Fang Qu Cheng, the accountant; and Zhang Yixing, the introducer. Eight and a half catties of opium and over 2 million yuan in cash were found in Li Jia Chi's residence. Several sets of smoking paraphernalia were found in Sun Zhou Shi's home. Zhang Mazi and Xu Amao escaped and are still at large.

After interrogating the suspects, it was learned that all the drugs belonged to Sun Zhou Shi and were entrusted to Mao Xing for sale by Sun Zhou Shi's nephew. Mao then entrusted them to Li Jia Chi, who instructed his servant Xiao Wei You and accountant Fang Qu Cheng to find a way to sell them. Xiao and Fang then entrusted Zhang Yixing, a tailor, who then introduced Liu Jincai through Zhang Mazi and Xu Amao. According to Sun Zhou Shi, the opium was her late husband's legacy, which she was selling to cover living expenses, and she was not solely engaged in this business.

The police bureau has sealed up the opium and funds totaling 23.8 million yuan and is currently pursuing the fugitives. The entire case will be transferred to the court for trial.

### Qidong Residents Endure Calamities; Every Household Hangs Flags to Welcome the National Army; The Market is Depressed; There is a Severe Shortage of Legal Tender

[Our Qidong Dispatch] This county, which has been occupied for nine years, was officially recovered at 4 p.m. on the 30th, with the cooperation of Xu Rong, the commander of the National Army's Independent Regiment, and Hu Xiaochun, the county magistrate. The National Army advanced rapidly and did not encounter any resistance. The reporter accompanied the National Army into the county seat, the location of the county government, for the first time and witnessed broken tiles, dilapidated walls, and overgrown weeds. The old county government and public security bureau buildings had been completely destroyed. When the National Army and the county government entered, the residents all stood in front of their doors, cheering from time to time, and every household hung flags. The reporter also learned from conversations with some residents that the Communist army had fled in a hurry to the northeast one hour before the National Army's entry. Before leaving, they had kidnapped more than 20 wealthy shop owners, allegedly because they feared they would welcome the National Army. The Communist army's Huazhong Bank office and the public grain materials they had forcibly requisitioned had all been auctioned off or transported away in the preceding days. The market in the recovered county is still depressed. The most severe shortage at present is legal tender. Many soldiers or civil servants who go to stores to buy goods mostly use cash for purchases, unable to get change. Most of the people seem to be unfamiliar with legal tender. As for the conversion of customs gold units to legal tender, there is even less understanding.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders the Suppression of Labor Unrest

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Gongyi believes that labor unrest has occurred frequently in various counties recently, such as the strikes in Wuxi silk factories, which are seriously affecting public order and are undoubtedly instigated by a small number of people. With the National Assembly about to convene and constitutional government soon to be implemented, it is imperative to strictly prevent these incidents to consolidate the situation. He has telegraphed all subordinate special commissioner's offices, instructing them to relay the following three admonitions to all counties, which must be strictly observed: (1) Various illegal organizations must not operate. (2) Labor and management must coordinate and absolutely prohibit shutdowns, slowdowns, strikes, and other events. (3) Any gatherings of the masses or organizations must be approved in advance and must not involve arbitrary marches or petitions. The order also earnestly exhorts local governments to establish sincere connections with local industrial and commercial circles so that the mediation of labor-management disputes can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### Zhejiang Provincial Construction Funds: Central Government Allocates in Installments

An emergency fund will be allocated first within the year, followed by another allocation from January to March next year. In June, a further allocation will be made based on actual needs. The ferry across the Qiantang River is currently using old wooden boats transferred from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company which are in disrepair and cannot be used. A decision on improvement measures will be made once the location of the two engines has been determined. Improvement is guaranteed within the year. In Dinghai, the shareholders and supervisors of the official-merchant joint fishing market have been appointed and the market will be established soon.

### The Changing of the Guard for Military Police on the Wuxi-Shanghai Line Has Been Completed

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] The military police units stationed in the counties along the Nanjing-Shanghai line from Wuxi to Shanghai all completed the replacement of old units with new units on the 1st. The original units of the 15th Military Police Regiment that had been serving were all concentrated in Wuxi for reorganization and training. The unit assigned to take over the new duties is Cai Longren's unit of the 9th Military Police Regiment. It is learned that the regimental headquarters will be set up in Wuxi, the 2nd Battalion will be stationed in Suzhou, and the 5th Battalion will be stationed in Kunshan.

### Land Price Dispute in Suzhou: The Provisional Consultative Council and the Land Registration Office are Deadlocked; The Director of the Construction Department Will Personally Mediate

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] After being assessed by the Land Registration Office, the land prices in this county were ten times higher than the prices approved by the provincial government two months ago and exceeded the market prices. The highest price reached 20 million yuan per mu. Therefore, the Provisional Consultative Council expressed its opposition and repeatedly invited Zhang Zi-, deputy director of the Land Registration Office, and Wu Zhongfan, a commissioner, to hold review meetings, but without results. Moreover, at the second review meeting, the Land Registration Office stated that it had reported to the Provincial Office for approval and could not make changes. Therefore, at the 25th regular meeting on October 23, the Provisional Consultative Council submitted the case to all resident members for joint discussion and resolved to immediately telegraph the Provisional Consultative Councils of the 14 counties in Jiangnan to inquire about the evaluation situation in various places and request them to jointly telegraph the Provincial Government to correct the errors of the Land Registration Office. At the same time, it sent a letter to the County Government instructing the office to immediately stop registration. On the one hand, it also sent a letter to the district offices asking them to inform the town offices to notify residents that they do not need to register within the time limit before the fair price is reassessed. Therefore, the registration work of the Land Registration Office has completely stalled. On the 25th, the Land Registration Office specially sent a letter to the Provisional Consultative Council requesting assistance. However, the Provisional Consultative Council had successively received reply telegrams from the Provisional Consultative Councils of various counties, responding one after another. Therefore, the Provisional Consultative Council has now decided to ignore any future letters from the Land Registration Office. It is reported that Dong Yaozan, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, will come to Suzhou for mediation within the next few days in order to promote land registration work as soon as possible.

### Agricultural Bank of China Issues Low-Interest Grain-Secured Loans in Zhejiang

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 1st] The autumn harvest is over, and grain prices are low. Farmers cannot bear the oppression of high-interest loans and are forced to sell new grain at low prices. During the Anti-Japanese War, the countryside was devastated, and farmers suffered the most. Out of compassion, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has consulted with the Central Farmers Bank to issue low-interest loans to secure grain. The method is for the Agricultural Bank to lend to cooperatives and farmers' associations, and indirectly lend to farmers. The maximum loan per household is 100,000 yuan, with an interest rate of 4 percent and an audit fee of 2 to 2.5 percent. All areas with no public security problems, surplus rice, or severe disasters can apply for loans from local Agricultural Bank offices.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that various counties and cities in the province have been repeatedly hit by natural disasters, with more than 30 counties affected. With the winter season approaching, winter relief should be expanded to benefit the victims. However, all should be based on fundraising in principle and no apportionment should be used. The cities and counties should also establish winter relief committees as soon as possible in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and actively handle them. An order has been issued to all counties and cities to comply.

Be Careful of Pickpockets When Mailing Packages at the Post Office

Last Monday afternoon, the Sichuan Road Post Office was particularly busy, especially the area for mailing large quantities of newspapers, which was crowded with people of all kinds. Pickpockets took advantage of the situation to stir up trouble. Without realizing it, my pen, which I depended on for my livelihood, disappeared. In addition to advising friends who mail packages to be careful, I also hope that the postal authorities can find a better way to prevent the activities of petty thieves and punish them severely! (Reader Shishan)

What About Deposits That Have Not Yet Matured?

The court's fair judgment regarding the repayment of pre-war deposits at 1,000 times their original value is, of course, infinitely appreciated by small pre-war depositors who cannot afford to appeal. However, this only refers to compensation for losses on matured deposits. What about deposits that have not yet matured and will not mature for several years? I am afraid that in this situation of rising prices day and night, there will be no compensation for losses when they mature in the future? Therefore, I hope the financial and judicial authorities will pay attention to this when considering repayment! If it is possible to repay them in advance or have other improved guarantee measures, then law-abiding citizens will share the great benefit. (Jiang Side)

The Price of Monthly Platform Tickets in Taiwan is Too High

There is no reason for the price of platform tickets at railway stations to rise from 300 yuan to 1,000 yuan. When women and children or the elderly get on the train, the railway bureau does not have specialized staff to take care of them, so their relatives and friends must help them, but the railway bureau charges 1,000 yuan for the people helping. This is no different from an excessive tax! If it is to prevent people who buy platform tickets from getting on the train without a ticket, then you can fine passengers without tickets and increase the fine appropriately. (Binggen)

General Response to the Appeals of Soldiers

We recently received a letter from the Ministry of National Defense, No. 35 Quan-Tong-Yi-7, stating: "We have received your letter of August 23 with respect.

We hope to see more in the future, so that we may improve." This is a special reply.

### On Behalf of the Post Office

To Mr. Chen Tiesheng: We have received a reply from the Shanghai Ferry Company, stating: "We are deeply aware that the roads in the Dongjiadu wharf area are rugged and uneven. When the Tangdong Line was reopened, we first invested more than 100,000 yuan to fill in the low-lying areas near the wharf to maintain traffic. As for further repairs, the project is related to road construction and we have contacted the competent bureau to plan for renovation and construction has already begun." Special reply.

To Mr. Zhang Maogou: Regarding your letter complaining about being insulted for buying flour, we have received a reply from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "After summoning Li Binchang, the owner of the Dongsheng Flour Shop, to the bureau for questioning on the 21st of this month, he stated that he did not assault or insult Zhang Maogou when he bought flour. He is a potsticker shop owner and uses one bag of flour every two days. That day, he requested to buy two bags, but the supply of flour was less than the demand, and there was a verbal conflict. A police officer was present to persuade him to come back tomorrow to buy another bag. He has been instructed to treat customers warmly in the future." Special delivery.

### The General Assembly Stage of the United Nations Ends; Various Committees Begin Work Separately; 55 Items on the Agenda Will Take Four to Five Weeks to Discuss

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 1st (Radio): Starting today, the United Nations organization will transition from the General Assembly stage to the stage where various committees work separately. The proposals currently being prepared for discussion include overthrowing the Franco regime in Spain, controlling atomic weapons, universal disarmament, and the implementation of the trusteeship system. In the next four to five weeks, the committees will debate various important issues and then submit reports to the General Assembly. The meeting place has been moved from Flushing to Success Lake, and the facilities are very complete, with sixteen committees meeting simultaneously. The committees holding meetings today include the Social, Human Rights, and Cultural Committee, the Administrative and Budgetary Committee, the Economic and Financial Committee, and the Trusteeship Committee. The General Assembly's agenda has now increased to 55 items.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 1st (Radio): Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela, three Latin American countries, held an important meeting today and unanimously agreed that it is not yet time to recommend that the United Nations sever relations with the Franco regime. It is expected that the Franco issue will be shelved temporarily.

[Central News Agency, New York, 31st (Special Telegram)] The Steering Committee of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously agreed this morning to include the following three proposals on the General Assembly's agenda: (1) Disarmament proposal by Soviet Union's Molotov, (2) Joint proposal on the Franco issue (both proposals have been submitted to the Political and Security Committee), and (3) Proposal by the Netherlands on women's political rights (this proposal has been submitted to the Social, Charity, and Cultural Committee). The first and third proposals were passed and included on the General Assembly's agenda without much discussion. However, the Spanish issue, which caused controversy, was hotly debated before a consensus was reached. Currently, the anti-Franco movement is very strong in the General Assembly, and it is expected that the Security Council will remove the Spanish issue from its agenda when it meets on the 4th, allowing the General Assembly to discuss it.

### Our Representative States Our Position: Upholding Justice and Assisting Oppressed Peoples; Fully Endorses Various Suggestions Proposed by the United States

[Our Special Correspondent, New York, 31st (Special Telegram)] Zhang Pingqun, the newly appointed chief press secretary of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly and the Chinese Consul General in New York, hosted a reception for 20 Chinese reporters at the "Top Good" Hotel in New York today. Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative, also attended. Gu said that the Chinese delegation intends to support India's complaint against racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa and intends to recommend that it be discussed publicly in the General Assembly. In addition, the Chinese delegation will also request Western countries to publicly report on the situation of mandated territories since 1919. Gu said that the Chinese delegation is paying close attention to the issue of handing over enemy colonies such as Japan's Pacific islands for trusteeship. The US government is hesitant on this issue, and the US diplomatic and military circles have different opinions. Gu reiterated China's confidence in the United Nations Charter and believes that it is too early to abolish the veto power. When discussing the West-Lia issue, Gu said that the Chinese delegation takes a dismissive and silent attitude towards the Franco regime. Franco has taken a bad attitude towards China since 1931, but China and Spain are far apart and there is not much importance. Gu hopes that an international army commanded by the United Nations can be established in the near future, and China will provide reasonable assistance to small countries and countries controlled by strong powers.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 31st] Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative, told the press that China fully endorses the various suggestions made recently by US delegation leader Austin in his speech to the General Assembly. The US delegation has clearly stated its views on the various important issues that the General Assembly should discuss through Senator Austin.

### Indigenous People of French Morocco Live a Slave Life; Appeal to the United Nations

[Reuters, Tangier, 31st] Nasiyani, chairman of the Moroccan Unification Party, telegraphed UN Secretary-General Lai Yi, requesting him to set up a committee to review the Moroccan issue. The telegram pointed out that more than one million Moroccans are living a life of slavery and isolation under the bayonets of the French army.

### South Africa's Indian Problem

Smuts Requests to Omit from Agenda; US Studies Charter Clause Interpretation

[United Press, New York, 31st] South African Prime Minister Smuts, in his address to the UN General Assembly today, argued against including the issue of South Africa's mistreatment of Indians on the agenda. He suggested waiting for the International Court of Justice to clarify the UN Charter's provisions on non-interference in member states' internal affairs before further discussion. It is said that UN interference in member states' internal affairs will ultimately lead to disasters for the UN itself and world peace. Smuts vigorously argued on behalf of South Africa that this explosive political issue should not be placed on the agenda, reiterating South Africa's position that the matter is entirely a domestic affair, with the majority of Indians being South African citizens, not Indian nationals.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 31st] Experts from the US delegation are studying the interpretation of the Charter, a matter arising from India's complaint against South Africa's discrimination against Indians. Article 2, Section 7 of the Charter stipulates that UN organizations have no authority to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any country. However, Article 1, Section 3 states that one of the purposes of UN organizations is to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction. These two provisions seem to conflict. Therefore, US experts are currently studying how the word "intervene" in Article 2 should be interpreted and how a domestic minority can bring their grievances to the attention of UN organizations. The United States is deeply aware that the decision made by the UN General Assembly on this matter will have a significant impact on countries with minority populations.

### Soviet, Czech, Yugoslav Refusal to Attend Danube River Shipping Conference

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 31st] UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie announced today that the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia have refused to participate in the International Danube River Navigation Conference.

France has set preconditions requiring acceptance by all Danube River countries before participating, making the convocation of the conference problematic.

### Slavic Nations Organize Bloc, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria at the Center, Increasing Pressure on Greece

[Reported by this Newspaper] London, 2nd Broadcast: Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are about to form a Balkan small-nation alliance, with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria at the center. Albania and Romania will participate. The initiators of this event are the communist elements of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Dissatisfied with the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference, they attempt to form a strong southern Slavic national bloc. If this bloc gains Albania's participation, it will certainly increase pressure on Greece.

### US Radio Station to Begin Broadcasting in Russian Next Year, Promoting Friendship Between the Two Countries

[Reported by this Newspaper] San Francisco, 2nd Broadcast: The US authorities, considering the strict Soviet censorship that prevents the Soviet people from knowing the truth about the US situation, have legally mandated broadcasting to the Soviet people in Russian starting from January 1st.

### Churchill's Speech Echoes Austin

[United Press, London, 31st] In his speech at the naming ceremony of the Free City of Birmingham today, Churchill echoed the proposal of US representative Austin at the UN General Assembly, stating that UN organizations should enable countries to fully exchange international military intelligence and implement a mutual monitoring system to ascertain all facts about world armaments.

### Wallace Speech Endorses the Republican Party

[Reported by this Newspaper] San Francisco, 1st Broadcast: Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace, while giving a speech for the Democratic Party's campaign movement at the Wisconsin Agricultural Cooperative Association today, said that world peace is being threatened by mutual suspicion and self-righteous stances between the US and the Soviet Union. Wallace stated that this situation has developed to a degree that threatens peace and the lives of every man, woman, and child. He advocated that the two countries establish a firm and candid agreement based on the principle of sincere cooperation to strive for world peace and prosperity.

[Agence France-Presse, Madison, Wisconsin, 31st] As the American election drums intensify, former Secretary of Commerce Wallace travels around giving speeches. Today, he declared here that if the Republican Party holds a majority in the next House of Representatives, it will lead to prosperity, and the deteriorating crisis in US-Soviet relations can be ended. He added that disarmament would not be impossible if the US and the Soviet Union could treat each other frankly. Wallace is supporting the opposing party as a Democrat, but he expressed dissatisfaction with Republican Senator Vandenberg because Vandenberg is of one mind with Secretary of State Byrnes.

### Four Foreign Ministers to Hold a Meeting, Byrnes Issues Warning, Refusing to Participate in Any New Meeting if No Agreement Can Be Reached on the German Question

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] US Secretary of State Byrnes recently told the press that if the four foreign ministers cannot achieve any progress or reach an agreement on the German question at the meeting in New York, he will refuse to participate in any new international conferences. However, it is practically impossible for the four foreign ministers to resolve the German question before November 20th.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] Secretary of State Byrnes announced to reporters today that he has cabled General Clay, commander of US forces in Germany, and his diplomatic advisor, Murphy, to return home on November 10th to consult in preparation for drafting a German peace treaty at the New York four foreign ministers meeting.

[Reported by this Newspaper] San Francisco, 2nd Broadcast: The Viceroy left Calcutta today to inspect the conflict zone. Also, Nehru was to fly to Calcutta tomorrow but has stopped.

[Reuters, Calcutta, 1st] Gandhi, at the age of seventy-seven, caught a cold and cough yesterday and is now feeling unwell. Over the past twenty-eight years, he has fasted nine times, nearly dying twice. Doctors say it is a miracle that he did not die.

[United Press, London, 31st] The India Office announced today that Sarat Chandra Bose, an Indian independence activist, will host friends tonight for a "last meal" before beginning a "fast to the death" for Indian independence. Bose recently sent letters to Lord Lawrence, Minister of the India Office, other cabinet members, and the literary giant George Bernard Shaw, stating that he will fast until India achieves independence.

### US to Spend $1.4 Billion Building Saipan and Guam Outposts, Existing Equipment Insufficient to Withstand Atomic Warfare

[United Press, Honolulu, 1st] The Honolulu "Star-Bulletin" today carried a report from Guam stating that the US Navy will spend $1 billion on Guam and $400 million on Saipan over the next five years to build outposts to defend against attacks from the west. According to Guam Governor Pownall, who spoke to a group of visiting journalists, the majority of the funds will be used to develop Guam's naval base and make Saipan an auxiliary to Guam. He advocated for the US to continue administering the former League of Nations mandated territories in the Pacific and opposed transferring them. All of our financial, human, and material resources are not yet sufficient to establish the defense that we should have. What the US needs is to establish countless interconnected bases like Guam in the Pacific. Our current defense equipment is far from sufficient to cope with atomic bombs and ballistic missile warfare.

### US Government Announces New Conscription Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] The US State Department has announced a new conscription plan to increase the number of recruits for its army, especially troops stationed in the Pacific region.

Those who volunteer for three years of service can freely choose the unit they want to be attached to in Japan and Korea.

### Penicillin Prices Plunge, Only 50 Cents for 100,000 Units in the US

In January 1944, when penicillin was first introduced to the market, it sold for $75 per vial.

### Japanese Invasion of the Pacific Stage Opens in International Court Yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Keenan Delivers Long Opening Statement

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 1st] The Far East International Court today entered the stage of trying the Pacific War. Chief Prosecutor Keenan delivered a long opening statement, stating that in 1938, Japan declared the New Order in East Asia, asserting its priority in China. In July 1939, the US notified the abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. In July 1941, Tojo initiated and convened an Imperial Conference, deciding that Japan, regardless of the world situation, would establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and unveil the

Southern Advance Policy

At the conference, Matsuoka, Shiratori, and others advocated participating in Germany's war against the Soviet Union before or simultaneously with the occupation of the south. On July 26, President Roosevelt ordered the freezing of Japanese assets, and commerce between Japan and the US, Britain, and the Netherlands was severed. On August 28, Konoe proposed a summit meeting between the heads of the two countries to President Roosevelt, attaching a statement saying: (1) The Japanese government will withdraw troops from Vietnam after the Sino-Japanese Incident is resolved and East Asia becomes independent. (2) The Japanese government declares that its current actions in Vietnam are not a preparatory means for military actions in neighboring areas. On September 3, the President proposed holding preparatory talks; on the 6th, the Japanese ambassador requested the US to cease its military measures in the Far East and Southwest Pacific. On the same day, Tojo and the military convened another

Imperial Conference

Deciding that if the talks could not achieve satisfactory results before mid-October, Japan would implement an attack. After Tojo came to power, the situation quickly turned towards war. The Imperial Conference on November 5 decided to complete preparations after the 25th and simultaneously begin combat operations. On the same day, Joint Fleet Secret Order No. 1 was issued, preparing to attack Pearl Harbor and preparing the Joint Fleet to fight against the US, Britain, and the Netherlands. Two days later, Secret Order No. 2 was issued. On November 10, all Japanese ships were ordered to complete combat preparations before the 20th, and powerful Japanese mobile units were ordered to assemble in the Kuril Islands. On the morning of the 26th of the same month, the order was given to attack Pearl Harbor. The mobile unit moved east at 6 PM, then proceeded south. During this period,

US-Japan Negotiations

continued as a smokescreen for the attack plan. On December 1, the final Imperial Conference was convened, attended by Togo, Tojo, Shimada, Kaya, Suzuki, Nagano, Hoshino, Oka, and Muto. No one expressed opposition to the decision to wage war. The "X" day was decided as December 8, Tokyo time. The cabinet discussed the form of notifying the declaration of war, and the result was to use a written notification of the start of the war. This document was neither a declaration of war nor a final ultimatum, and it was to be delivered one hour after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The issuance and delivery time of this document was Togo's responsibility. On December 6, Togo sent a long cable to Ambassador Nomura, instructing him not to submit it until further instructions were received. On the 7th, instructions were given to submit the telegram at 1 PM Washington time on the 7th. On the evening of the 6th, President Roosevelt cabled the Emperor of Japan personally,

Hoping to Avert a Tragic

Situation. The telegram arrived in Tokyo at noon on the 7th, Tokyo time, but it was not delivered to Ambassador Grew until 10:30 PM. Grew handed it to Togo at 0:05 AM on the 8th, and Togo indicated that he would present it to the Emperor immediately. However, less than an hour later, Japanese invading forces had already begun landing at Singora in northeastern British Malaya. Meanwhile, in Washington, Ambassador Nomura requested a meeting with Secretary of State Hull at 1 PM local time on the 7th, but the meeting did not take place until 40 minutes later. At that time, Pearl Harbor had been under attack for 25 minutes, and the attack on Singora had also begun. The attack on Pearl Harbor was carried out by 360 aircraft launched from six Japanese aircraft carriers anchored 220 nautical miles north of the site.

Sneak Attack on Pearl Harbor

Had a great effect. The US fleet had four battleships sunk and four battleships severely damaged, as well as three cruisers and three destroyers each. Navy officers and men, from Admiral Kimmel down, killed 1,199; Marine Corps deaths totaled 109; civilian deaths totaled 546; 188 aircraft were lost on the ground, and coastal facilities suffered heavy damage. The Japanese lost eight aircraft and five small submarines, with fewer than 100 killed or wounded. An hour later, Nomura handed the aforementioned notification to Hull. At 7 AM, Tokyo time, Japanese radio first broadcast that the battle had begun. At 7:30 AM, Togo invited Grew to meet with him, said that he would meet the Emperor at 3 AM, and handed Grew a copy of the document that Nomura had handed to Hull in Washington, saying that this was the Emperor's reply to President Roosevelt's personal telegram, which was obviously false. At noon on the same day, the Emperor issued an

Edict of War

Tojo then issued a statement, saying that the attack was a means of self-defense. From then on, the Japanese people were driven down the road to war. Hundreds of thousands of houses and millions of lives were sacrificed before the god of war to satisfy the ambitions of the accused. The invasion of the Northeast, the sweep of North China, and the annexation of all of China were all studied, planned, and acted upon by these defendants. The broad strategic goal of the accused was to annex all of China, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and New Zealand.

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] The indictment of the Japanese defendants by the Tokyo International Court is nearing completion, and the defense side will soon begin its arguments. The defense side plans for the trial to be extended until mid-June next year. Defense lawyers have requested the court to hold general and sectional debates, as well as final individual defenses for each defendant. If each defendant and his witnesses take up one week, then the 27 defendants will require 27 weeks. When the debates will begin will be decided within a few days.

### Crash Outside Zhenru Station, Ten-Wheel Truck Shattered and Caught Fire, Train Engine Also Damaged, Fortunately No Casualties on Both Sides, Beijing-Shanghai Train Delayed for One and a Half Hours

Yesterday morning, another collision between a train and a ten-wheel truck occurred on the Beijing-Shanghai line outside Zhenru Station. Fortunately, the train driver noticed it early, and the truck driver also managed to escape in time, so there were no casualties. The Beijing-Shanghai train was delayed for one and a half hours as a result. After the accident, Deputy Director Hou of the Bureau, along with Deputy Directors of the Transportation Department Guan Duo and Wu Yukun, Transportation Section Chief Zhou Weidong, and Shanghai-Wuxi Section Chief Ouyang Qiu, led a team on a rescue vehicle to repair the line. Traffic was not restored until 1 PM. A reporter from the East China News Agency investigated the details as follows: The Beijing-Shanghai Train No. 8 departed from Shanghai North Station at 11 AM yesterday and arrived at Zhenru Station at 11:14 AM. The public road due north outside the station boundary was already damaged and marked as closed to traffic. Unexpectedly, a ten-wheel truck from the First Equipment Road Construction Corps of the Ministry of Transportation was driving south from the north. When it reached the railroad crossing, it suddenly stopped moving forward. At that time, Train No. 8 was approaching. The truck driver, Lang Changqing, upon seeing this, immediately abandoned the vehicle and fled. By the time the train driver noticed, he immediately applied the brakes, but it was too late, resulting in a violent collision with the truck. With a loud crash, the truck was thrown several zhang away into a small ditch and immediately caught fire. The train engine was also damaged. After the accident, the Zhenru Station Master urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Railway Administration for help. Train No. 8 returned to Zhenru Station at 11:45 AM and switched to another engine. The line was not cleared and reopened until 1 PM. The truck driver, Lang Changqing, was immediately apprehended by personnel dispatched by the Police Department of the Railway Bureau. According to his confession, the truck was transporting workers from the Road Construction Corps back to their dormitory. Due to a momentary desire for convenience, he took a shortcut, resulting in this disaster. He was then transferred by the Police Department to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.

### Lottery Held Yesterday for Eliminating Rickshaws, "Four" Drawn

The municipal authorities, in compliance with central government orders, held a public lottery to eliminate rickshaws in the city at 1 PM on the 1st in the Municipal Government Conference Room. More than 40 people attended, including responsible persons from various bureaus and representatives from the Rickshaw Business Association and the Labor Union. Deputy Director Zhang Rentao of the Public Utilities Bureau presided over the meeting and outlined the process of implementing the elimination of rickshaws in the city, stating that the elimination would begin this winter and be completed within two years, as stipulated by the central government. There are a total of 20,582 licensed rickshaws and 6,308 private rickshaws in the city. Currently, one-tenth, approximately 2,000, will be eliminated using a lottery system with ten numbers (1 to 0). The number drawn will determine which rickshaws are eliminated, with any rickshaw whose license number ends in the drawn number being subject to elimination.

Rickshaws that are the sole property of their owners will not be eliminated this winter to show compassion. However, this does not apply to owners who apply to transfer the rickshaw after the authorities announced the implementation measures two days before the deadline for transferring ownership. For rickshaws selected for elimination, licensed rickshaw companies must surrender their licenses to the Public Utilities Bureau Registration Office before December of this year, and private rickshaw owners must also surrender their licenses to the Public Utilities Bureau Registration Office. If the licenses are not returned, the police will prohibit their use starting January 1st of next year. After the chairman finished his report, to ensure fairness, he had ten bamboo slips, each marked with a number, inspected by representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Rickshaw Labor Union, and then placed in a round paper tube covered with a white cloth. Zhou Lianze, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, drew a slip and immediately drew the slip with the number "four". This is the last digit of the license number of the rickshaws to be eliminated this winter. By the end of December, all rickshaws with a license number ending in "four" must be eliminated.

### Gathering of Students Returned from America, Mayor Wu Expresses Views, Should Have Selfless Spirit

[Reported by this Newspaper] Yesterday at noon, the Association of Students Returned from America held a gathering at the Great Eastern Restaurant. Mayor Wu was invited to attend and expressed his views on university education, stating:

The purpose of education is to increase knowledge. University education is to teach a person to be more like a "human" and more different from "beasts."

Former US Ambassador to China Hurley said, "Generalissimo Chiang is great." Hurley is a person with no prejudice. Why did he admire Chairman Chiang? He said, "Because he has a 'selfless spirit.'" Therefore, all people should forget themselves. Think more about others and less about themselves.

Currently, the citizens living in Shanghai inevitably have many dissatisfactions with Shanghai, such as high prices and social instability. Therefore, the most important measure for rectifying Shanghai is to suppress prices. However, to suppress prices, it is necessary to facilitate transportation. To facilitate transportation, it is necessary to stop the civil war. Everyone present is a student returned from America, and I believe you will contribute good ideas, and I will humbly accept them.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Transfer Passenger Ships to Operate on North and South China Sea Routes

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the operation of the Zhonglian Company's Hualian ship on the Shanghai-Tianjin route in the Bohai Sea, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is also planning to add passenger ships to the route. However, apart from the Yangtze River ships, which are passenger ships, the rest of the company's ocean-going ships are cargo ships. Therefore, the company is planning to purchase passenger ships. To meet the current urgent needs, it is planned to transfer the Jiangya and Jiangjing ships from the Ningbo route to operate on the North and South China Sea routes. The Jiangjing ship was recently dispatched to Hankou to transport National Assembly representatives to Beijing.

### A Group of Wanderers: Presenting Flags and Paying Respects to Relevant Authorities in Different Directions. Eight Hundred Refugee Children Are No Longer What They Used to Be

Yesterday at noon, refugee children from the Shanghai Relief Institute's Refugee and Orphanage Reception Center set off from Caohejing to present flags and pay respects to various relevant authorities in the city. The large procession consisted of 800 children, led by the director of the center, Zhou Zuwang, on foot. A large banner reading "We Were Originally a Group of Wanderers" led the way, which was quite thought-provoking. Following was a military band, which played exceptionally well. The marching ranks were orderly and full of energy, quite unlike wanderers. The group arrived at the Shanghai branch of the Youth League at 1:00 PM to present a flag. The head of the league, Wu Shaoshu, personally received them. After the flag presentation, Wu gave a speech, saying: "You were once wandering children on the streets, but now you are the backbone of the nation. I hope that those of you who are determined to serve the country will join the Youth League. I welcome you very much." Afterwards, they performed drills in the Youth League square. Their marching was orderly and their spirits were high, which was commendable.

Then, they presented a flag to the Bureau of Social Affairs, arriving at 2:30 PM. As Director Wu Kaixian was away on business, a representative accepted the flag on his behalf. The flag was inscribed with the four characters "Xu Ku Chui Sheng" (breathing life into the withered), which had a profound meaning. At 3:30 PM, they arrived at the Municipal Council to present a flag to Speaker Pan. The secretariat received them, gave them a short rest, and distributed bread and tea. Speaker Pan arrived in person and, together with all the members of the Works and Police Committees who were holding a meeting at the council yesterday, received the flag amidst the sound of military music. The flag was inscribed with the four characters "He Fu Meng Ze" (crucian carp receiving rain). After receiving the flag, the group proceeded to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Wu. After Mayor Wu received the flag and saw the four characters "Tui Shi Jie Yi" (sharing food and clothing), he was deeply moved. He summoned them for a speech, speaking through tears. He said: "I am very grateful to you, but I am even more saddened, because I am so touched by you. In my position as mayor, I should help you and raise you. But in the past you were wandering on the streets, and this is our fault, it is because we are not doing our jobs well. I cannot blame you. I am really sorry to you. In the future, I will do my best to reduce the number of wanderers on the streets and fulfill our responsibilities." After finishing his speech, he instructed the leader of the group, Zhou Zuwang, to take good care of them on their way back. The refugee children then lined up and left the Municipal Government.

### Impressions of National Assembly Representative from Fujian, Zhan Diaoyuan: An Old Man at the Jinmen Hotel, Enduring a Long Journey While Caring for National Affairs

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Zhan Diaoyuan, a 77-year-old National Assembly representative from Fujian Province, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Xiamen the day before yesterday and is now staying in a modern room on the third floor of the Jinmen Hotel. He is wearing a blue cloth robe and a small melon-shaped hat. He is missing two front teeth. His gray beard is neither long nor short and hangs down in front of his chest. His temples are also gray. What interested me the most was the shiny water pipe in his hand. I remember seeing this kind of smoking device commonly used by my grandparents in my rural life as a child. Now, more than ten years later, I saw this old object again on the third floor of one of the most modern hotels in this bustling city. As I faced this figure that seemed like he was from my grandfather's generation, despite the noisy sounds of cars, horses, and pedestrians coming from Nanjing Road outside the window, I could not help but indulge in a nostalgic mood.

Another National Assembly representative, Mr. Yang Fengnian, who introduced me to the reporter, was once the brigade commander of the 49th Division of the Army around 1926 and is now the speaker of the Zhangzhou Municipal Council. He broke my reverie and said, "What is most commendable this time is Mr. Zhan. We all advised him not to come, but he is very enthusiastic about national affairs and insisted on participating."

Indeed, in the eyes of this 77-year-old man, there was still a spark of passion. Although his voice had become very low and short, I could believe that he still retained the heart of a middle-aged man, at least in spirit. When I asked him if the journey was tiring, he said that the plane was as stable as a car. And after arriving in Shanghai, he even walked to the Daxin Company for sightseeing in the morning.

He took a few puffs from his water pipe, stood up, thought for a moment, and walked a few steps. He said to me excitedly, "Originally, a person of my age would not need to travel so far. But this National Assembly is too important for the country. We have been talking about constitutionalism since the time of Yuan Shikai in 1913. It has been more than thirty years, and we still haven't drafted a constitution!"

Regarding the constitution, he supports the "May 5th Draft Constitution." At this National Assembly, he said that he plans to propose a motion to accelerate the implementation of local autonomy. "Only locally elected officials will not engage in corrupt behavior." This is a common belief that he and Mr. Yang expressed in unison.

When talking about events from decades ago, Mr. Zhan became even more energetic. He said that in the year of the Xinhai Revolution (1911), he planned the restoration of three prefectures in Fujian. His comrades carried copper gongs and shouted on the streets. "Thirty-five years!" He sighed with endless emotion. Finally, he suddenly laughed and said, "When I joined the Kuomintang, you didn't even know where you were!"

After bidding farewell to this old revolutionary and walking out of the Jinmen Hotel, a complex emotion welled up in my heart. I thought of the suffering of China and the old representatives... all of this gave us too many feelings.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The condition of Terminal, former advisor to Chairman Chiang, has worsened recently. Yesterday, our reporter drove to Hong En Hospital to visit him, but as visiting hours were over and the doctor had ordered him to rest, we were unable to see him.

### Two Witnesses in Sun Tianchang's Case of Aiding the Enemy Also Suspected of Crimes: Hu Chengeng and Xu Tianxi Indicted by the Commercial Inspection Office

### High Court Continues Trial of Zhao Zunyue: Testimony of Six Witnesses Favorable

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Zunyue, who served as the puppet propaganda minister, deputy secretary-general of the puppet Central Political Council, secretary-general of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, and deputy minister of the puppet Ministry of Railways, was retried by the High Court yesterday afternoon. Many witnesses were questioned, and their testimony was favorable to the defendant. Zhao himself also gave a defense. After the evidence was investigated in court, the case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was still detained in the Zhongjian Prison.

The six witnesses who were called yesterday testified as follows: (1) Qi Zaizhi stated: "It is true that the defendant protected the radio station, provided funds, and established contact with the central government. And the defendant helped rescue me three times when I was arrested four times." (2) Zhou Shaowen, principal of Lequn Middle School and director of the Shanghai branch of the Youth League, stated: "I was arrested by the enemy's military police on December 15, 1943, along with more than forty people. The defendant rescued me." (3) Yang Jiren (Yang Siyi), a major general member of the Central Training Corps and former senior counselor of the Third War Zone, stated: "I was assigned by the commander to carry out counter-espionage work. The defendant introduced me to Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai." (4) Yao Jilang, principal of the Municipal Wuben Elementary School, stated: "I was arrested twice, and the defendant rescued me both times. The fact that Wuben Elementary School was changed from a municipal school to a private school and was not taken over by the enemy was also due to the defendant's protection." (5) Zhao Qihua, a Western doctor, stated: "At that time, I was treating Jiang Bocheng. Jiang was monitored by the enemy's military police, so I informed the defendant and asked him to find a way to improve the situation." (6) Luo Bao, a member of the Counter-Espionage Committee, testified that the defendant established a radio station to contact the central government, and that the defendant's appointment as secretary-general of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government was at the suggestion of the Counter-Espionage Committee to facilitate counter-espionage work, which was also one of the reasons.

(Additional report) Huang Heting, a rice merchant, was accused of serving as the head of the first township (later changed to the first joint protection) of the puppet Shanghai Zhabei district. After investigation yesterday, the case was also adjourned for further hearing.

### Finance Bureau Investigates Field Taxes: Property Owners Can Register

### Registration Required by End of Year for Custody or Use of Public Land

[Our Newspaper's Report] At the 53rd municipal conference held yesterday morning, two proposals related to land registration were approved.

Public land that has not been registered after the deadline will be taken over by the Land Administration Bureau in accordance with the law. The other is that the land rights of non-treaty foreigners and stateless foreigners in the six land registration areas of Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Wusong, Fahua, and Yinxiang should also be registered with the Land Administration Bureau before December 31 of this year for processing. Those who fail to apply for registration after the deadline will be considered ownerless land.

### Several Chinese Merchant Warehouses Close Down: Business Difficulties, Two Reasons

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Enemy Property Management Bureau entrusted the Jianghai Customs to handle the various enemy and puppet materials stored in the city's warehouses for several months. As a result, 70% to 80% of the materials have been cleared, and the congestion in the warehouses has been greatly improved. However, the business situation of the public merchant warehouse industry has fallen into a state of recession. Several businesses have closed down in October.

The reasons for the business difficulties of Chinese merchant warehouses are that they are difficult to compete with foreign merchants in terms of equipment and scope, and that there is also intense competition within the industry. Among them, the warehouses established by silver and money shops operating pawn shops have formed their own system and have not joined the guild. These warehouses have interest income to subsidize them, so their fees are half the price of ordinary warehouses, only 80 yuan per cubic meter per month, while ordinary warehouses charge 160 yuan. Therefore, customers naturally tend to choose the former and can obtain the convenience of pawn loans. In fact, according to people in the ordinary warehouse industry, a fee of 160 yuan per cubic meter is at risk of loss under rising prices. Another phenomenon is that although the warehouses that previously stored enemy and puppet materials have now been cleared, the losses over the past year have been considerable. Although the Enemy Property Management Bureau also provided rent during the period, it was far from the market price. Before June, only 15 yuan per cubic meter per month was given, and from June onwards, it only increased to 25 yuan. Now that the materials have been cleared, it is difficult to find customers for the time being, so many businesses have closed down.

### Court Police Arrest Suspect: Woman Falsely Reports Robbery

[Our Newspaper's Report] A man named Gu Laoqi was recently reported to have served as a "hugging foot" in gambling dens, extensively recruiting disciples, and committing illegal acts under the guise of the enemy's power. After the High Prosecutor's Office accepted the case, it dispatched judicial police officers Wang Junhua and Ni Zixiang to arrest him at his wives' residences yesterday morning. His concubine, Gu Yexiuqing, lived at 17 Nanhua New Village, Pushi Road. Three court police officers went to the address and were met by Gu Yexiuqing, who replied that Gu Laoqi was not there. She claimed that she had a brother in the Military Intelligence Bureau and wanted to talk to them, asking them to wait. After speaking, she turned around and went outside to call the Changshu Road Police Station, reporting that there were robbers. The police station, because the location of the incident was not within its jurisdiction, relayed the message to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched 30 to 40 officers, fully armed, to the address to apprehend the suspects. When they arrived at the destination, the court police officers realized that it was a misunderstanding and immediately stepped forward to explain the reason. Gu Yexiuqing was taken back to the police station by the police officers, and the three court police officers followed along. After the High Prosecutor's Office learned of the situation, it immediately sent a letter to the police station, and the three court police officers were released. Gu Yexiuqing was taken to the High Prosecutor's Office by the court police officers for reprimand for intentionally making a false report. However, Gu Laoqi has still not been apprehended.

Suddenly, Qu Lianfu, Secretary of the Municipal Government, and Shen Wenyuan came forward, stating that the materials had been sealed by the Municipal Government beforehand, requesting a halt to the receiving, and claiming that official documents were being drafted. Since Secretary Qu represented the Municipal Government's participation in the Receiving Committee's work, it was agreed to temporarily suspend the transport for further processing. Subsequently, an official letter was received from the Municipal Government requesting a halt to the receiving, which was reported and handled accordingly, and the original informant was informed. Later, the Receiving Committee was ordered to dissolve, and the entire file was transferred to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for handling. The portion of materials already received and stored in the Albert Road warehouse was also transferred to the Jianghai Customs for inventory. The entire process of the case, the handling bureau has files to review. When I was handling the case, I acted based on facts and did not harbor any preconceived notions. The information in your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. I fear there may be misunderstandings, so I am writing to request a correction. Hoping for publication. Lu Shishang

### Mayor Wu Warns Oil Merchants: No Excuses to Create Black Markets; Those Hoarding Raw Materials Will Be Forced to Have Other Factories Produce

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Mayor Wu convened a meeting at the Municipal Government with representatives from China Vegetable Oil Factory, China Edible Oil Company, the Oil Cake and Foodstuff Industry Association, the Oil Cake and Foodstuff Retailers Association, as well as Chief Ji of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. Mayor Wu inquired in detail about the causes of the recent fluctuations in cooking oil prices and the crux of the matter. Subsequently, a representative from the Oil Cake and Foodstuff Industry Association stated that rising oil prices were due to insufficient electricity supply affecting production. Mayor Wu expressed great dissatisfaction with this explanation, as a thorough prior investigation showed that except for the Zhongzhi Oil Factory, which requires more electricity, the remaining oil factories generally require less electricity, so supply is not a problem. Therefore, their production should not be reduced due to electricity. The reasons for oil price fluctuations are nothing more than (1) oil merchants fueling speculation and manipulating the market, and (2) oil factories hoarding raw materials and taking a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, Mayor Wu issued a warning, advising oil merchants not to make unfounded speculations and create black markets. For the second point, if raw materials are owned but not used for production, they can be entrusted to other factories for production, otherwise strict measures will be taken. It was also decided to summon Cao Xingeng, director of the Oil Pressing Industry Association, at 11:00 AM today to thoroughly inquire and clarify the truth. Finally, Mayor Wu expressed satisfaction with the joint distribution of edible oil by Zhongzhi and Zhongshi and announced on the spot that in order to strengthen Zhongzhi's production, the factory's weekly power outage on Fridays could be lifted.

### Gold and Currency Easing

Yesterday, under the Central Bank's control, smelted gold showed some stability. It opened at 2,348,000 to 2,353,000, but then declined slightly, gradually falling with frequent pressure. Buying interest was suppressed. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 60 bars at a price of 2,327,500. After that, there was no strength to recover. Near noon, the market dropped to 2,323,000 before stabilizing. At noon, it hovered around 2,330,000. The afternoon was relatively stable, still able to rise above 2,340,000. As a result, it recovered a small 8,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold and silver remained unchanged. Silver dollars rose to around 2,000 yuan. Private short-term lending was flat, with private interest rates at around 1.5%.

Foreign currency conditions eased slightly. In the unofficial market, US dollars initially quoted at 4,180 yuan for selling and 4,130 yuan for buying. At noon, it fell slightly to between 4,120 yuan and 4,170 yuan, and finally dropped below 4,150 yuan, resulting in a slightly lower closing than the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were relatively stable, but buying interest was slightly weaker, with little change in results. Hong Kong remittances were limited to actual sales, at 895 yuan. Indian remittances were at 1,090 yuan, and British remittances were around 14,300 yuan, with little trading. The official US dollar exchange rate remained unchanged, with no trading.

Buyers took a wait-and-see approach, and sellers prevailed, gradually falling to below 1,750 yuan at the close, resulting in a further decline of 110 yuan compared to the previous close. Series A and B were flat, Series D fell slightly by 20 yuan, and Series E fell by 40 yuan.

### Money Market More Relaxed at the End of Last Month

[Our Reporter] According to financial circles, the allocation of funds at the end of last month was not as tight as in previous months. The stability of the money market was unprecedented. This is because before the implementation of the Treasury Law by the Changju Bureau, various sectors often accumulated payments for materials distributed by state-owned enterprises and taxes due to tax authorities until the end of each month. Financial institutions are also required to close their accounts at the end of each month. Under this dual pressure, the money market often tightened at the end of each month. Now that government funds must be concentrated and paid into the national treasury and must be paid at any time without delay or accumulation, it is estimated that the pressure on the money market at the end of each month will be reduced considerably in the future.

### Soap Subject to Commodity Tax; Chamber of Commerce Cables for Exemption

[Our Reporter] The City Chamber of Commerce notes that the current Commodity Tax Regulations, Article 3, Category 13, which includes cosmetics, lists 14 items, and soap is one of the 14 items. However, soap is only used for washing the body and has the same nature as toothpaste and tooth powder for cleansing, and does not contain any aesthetic or decorative meaning, which is completely different from snow cream, lipstick, perfume, rouge, and other items. Currently, when the Legislative Yuan formulated the Commodity Tax Regulations, toothpaste and tooth powder were not included in cosmetics for commodity tax collection, so it is reasonable to make an exception for soap. A telegram has been sent to the Legislative Yuan proposing an amendment.

### Silk Suddenly Out of Stock; Next Month's Futures All Sold Out

### Rumors of Issuing Sun Yat-sen Currency Denied by Finance Minister Yu

### Spinning Mills Have Additional Output; Yarn Prices Fall by Over 100,000; Fangjian Cloth and Linbu are Sold Off at a Loss; Cotton Spinning Industry Association Maintains Contracts

[Our Reporter] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a general meeting of all members at the association's headquarters yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than 30 representatives from various member companies attended. Mr. Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the association, presided over the meeting. The four key points provided by the Textile Management Committee the other day were discussed separately. Regarding the first point, the representatives believed that it was inappropriate to make changes to already established contracts, such as making adjustments for overpayment or underpayment, in commercial practice. Therefore, it was decided to ask Mr. Wang Qiyu and several representatives to personally explain the difficulties to Chairman Wu next Monday. Regarding the second, third, and fourth points, the representatives all believed that they could be followed. Regarding the Textile Management Committee's proposal to provide price negotiation forms, the representatives believed that since the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association has a price negotiation committee, it is hoped that the price negotiation steps can still be determined by the price negotiation committee, submitted to the Textile Management Committee for approval, and then notified to each factory by the price negotiation committee for compliance. The representatives all expressed satisfaction with the proposal to increase the amount of yarn and cloth transported to the South. Chairman Wu decided to fully simplify the application procedures for the factories to transport yarn and cloth to the South, so that the city's yarn and cloth can be transported to the South as soon as possible to relieve the panic of yarn and cloth in South China.

Also, the yarn allocated by the spinning mills in this port on the 26th of last month, totaling 12,000 pieces, has been allocated to practical users by the six associations, including the Yetian Dyeing and Weaving Industry. Currently, customers have prepared the full amount in accordance with the three-day provision in the yarn allocation reservation form. Up to today, they are exchanging warehouse receipts for the allocated yarn at the spinning mills, and the clearance is proceeding smoothly. Yesterday, various spinning mills produced additional cotton yarn to help suppress the market conditions. Yong'an Spinning Mill produced 450 pieces, China Textile Spinning Mill produced 828 pieces, Rongfeng Spinning Mill produced 400 pieces, and Hengda Spinning Mill produced 90 pieces. It is said that Shenxin Textile Company will also produce yarn today.

Yesterday, cotton yarn prices declined on the market. Because the cotton yarn distributed by the Joint Distribution Association this time was re-allocated by the direct production complex industry association, coupled with the excessive cost of capital, they were competing to sell in the market. The price of each count of yarn fell by 150,000 to 250,000. In addition, Yong'an and other spinning mills had additional allocations, so buyers were sufficient and transactions were scarce. 20-count double yarn fell below the 2 million mark, 42-count fell to 3.4 million yuan, and 32-count was quoted at 2.2 million yuan.

Cotton cloth prices are deteriorating downstream. There is more selling than buying in the market. The goods released by Fangjian the day before yesterday were even sold off at a loss. The popular No. 190 Indanthrene also plummeted. Chick Brand Shilin fell to 120,000 yuan, and Mainland Shilin was only selling for 118,000 yuan. Although dye prices have not fallen, colored cloth has declined sharply. Due to weak sales, the fabric intake of various dyeing factories is also stagnant. Longtou fine cloth is 83,000 yuan, middle-grade Yulong fine cloth fell to 70,000 yuan, and low-grade Changzhou goods are only quoted at 60,000 yuan, with no buyers.

### Bearish Sentiment Rampant; Chinese Stocks Fall Sharply

Chinese stocks showed bearish signs yesterday. With the news of the deadline for paying yarn and cloth settlement funds spreading, buyers were hesitant. In the morning, under the eagerness of brokers, Yongsha勉强成交 at 690 yuan, but then it was sold off aggressively. Xinnuo fell sharply. After the opening, there was a sound of selling, and each stock fell sharply without much support. The supply side succumbed to the pressure of the bear market and was unable to rise. Those closing overnight positions, such as No. 164, closed their positions one after another. Yongsha fell to the edge of the 660 yuan mark, and Meiya even broke the 3,000 yuan mark. However, at this time, Nos. 176 and 232 entered at low prices, and No. 89 and others also covered short positions. There were frequent fluctuations after the decline, but the overall situation was unfavorable, and it was easy to fall and difficult to rise. In the afternoon, the results of the popular stocks, including Yongsha, Meiya, Xinnuo, and Jingfu, all fell by about half a percent. Xinguang fell by 4%, and Qinxing fell by 6%. Among the cold stocks, Lianan was flat, and the rest fell slightly. The market stabilized slightly in the afternoon. Before long, there were sales at high prices, and the table gang and scattered short sellers were almost unanimous in their short selling activities. It gradually fell back to the morning and noon low prices, and then hovered slightly. As a result, compared with the previous close, the popular stocks, including Yongsha, Xinguang, and Qinxing, fell by 4%, and Meiya, Xinnuo, and Jingfu fell by half a percent. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang, Zhongsheng, Xinya, Lianan, and Huafeng were flat, and the rest fell slightly to half a percent. Most of the stocks outside the market fell.

Foreign stocks continued to rise at the opening, but it was still difficult to maintain after the high. The securities gang sold off at high prices and turned slightly lower. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha, British Federation Paper, and Asian Steel all fell sharply. Yipi and Jardine Matheson fell by about half a percent. Yeguang was flat.

### Sugar Rationing Commences on the 7th of This Month; One Jin Per Person Per Month

In order to eliminate the black market for sugar, the Municipal Government will implement a sugar rationing plan.

It is understood that the sugar purchase certificates for citizens have been distributed by the Civil Affairs Department to the districts, neighborhoods, and households. Sales will begin simultaneously at all Southern Goods Stores on the 7th of this month. According to the investigation by the Civil Affairs Department, there are 3.6 million citizens in this city. 3.6 million sugar purchase certificates have been issued, stipulating that each person can purchase one jin of sugar per month, totaling 3.6 million jin, for a total allocation of 20,000 bags (180 jin per bag). The Taiwan Sugar Corporation has prepared everything. On the 4th of this month, the Southern Goods Stores will pay the money and pick up the goods. Sales will begin on the 7th. Regarding prices, the Sugar Review Committee has decided that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation will sell to the Southern Goods Stores at 800 yuan per jin, and the Southern Goods Stores will sell to the citizens at 1,000 yuan per jin. The Southern Goods Stores will have a profit of 200 yuan per jin. If the neighborhood or household leaders withhold the certificates, or the Southern Goods Stores raise prices, citizens can report them. After selling the sugar, the Southern Goods Stores will submit the citizens' sugar purchase (blank) to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for settlement. If there is a surplus, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation can recover the sugar at the original price. If the Southern Goods Stores do not want to return the goods, they will pay an additional 500 yuan to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation at a limit price of 1,300 yuan per jin.

### American Cotton Recovers

[United Press New York 31st] The cotton market was very active this morning, and cotton prices soared, reaching the maximum limit of ten points. There were few sellers, which was a novelty in the last two weeks. Apparently, someone is willing to pay high prices to buy large quantities of cotton. Distant months rose sharply, closing up 4.75 to ten points from the previous day.

[United Press New Orleans 31st] Today, cotton prices rose to the ten-point limit due to large-scale purchases by spinning mills.

### Silk Weaving Industry Loan Handled by China Communications Bank; Equipment as Collateral Not Likely

The Shanghai silk weaving industry's application for a loan has been approved by the Four Joint Offices and issued five loan measures. The industry association is now investigating the status of its members and the amount of loans applied for, which will be completed soon and submitted for approval. At 3:00 PM on the 31st, the industry specifically sent Standing Director Liu Qingyi, Cai Xintao, and Chief Secretary Zhang Shouyu to the Central Bank to request two points regarding the loan: (1) Silk weaving factories with ten or more sets of motors plan to pledge 30% of the equipment, and (2) small factories with less than ten machines plan to have the Silk Industry Bank provide loans, which will then be re-mortgaged to the Central Bank. The Business Bureau instructed that loan collateral should be discussed with the China Communications Bank and handled in accordance with the measures promulgated by the Four Joint Offices. As for loans to small silk weaving factories, they can be handled by local lending syndicates in accordance with the small factory loan measures. Subsequently, the China Communications Bank stated that the silk weaving industry's request to pledge 30% of the equipment was unnecessary because the raw materials and finished products were sufficient for collateral. The detailed loan measures will be decided after a subcommittee meeting.

The referee will be Zhang Zhiren, and the linesmen will be Zhu [missing character] and Wang Chongye. Tickets are uniformly priced at two thousand yuan. Although Longjie team, after being promoted to Group A this year, suffered an initial setback against Donghua, the threat it posed to the opponent shows that its strength is by no means ordinary. The hope of victory is extremely high in today's match against the British Navy. The British Navy has not been in Shanghai for long and performed in the birthday celebration exhibition match. Although it did not live up to expectations, unfamiliarity with the place and the fatigue of the journey also had an impact. They will definitely go all out to contend with Longjie in today's match.

It was not until Donghua's Zhuang Youren hit a goal at the end of the first half that Donghua took the lead by one point with a score of 22 to 20. After the break, the two teams played again. Pei Er worked hard to counterattack, but Donghua still maintained its leading position. Pei Er repeatedly defended the front, but it was difficult to break through.

### A Hard-working Deaf Student: Zu Zhengang Goes to the United States for Further Study, Bidding Farewell to Deaf Compatriots Before Departure

[Reported by this newspaper] Deaf student Zu Zhengang, limited by his physical defects, was unable to pursue further studies in the country. Deeply resentful, he struggled to become self-reliant and eventually became a standing director of the Chinese Association for the Deaf and Mute and worked in the Statistics Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Recently, the New York School for the Deaf and Mute in the United States sent a telegram specially authorizing him to enroll for further studies, and our Ministry of Education also allocated US$1,000 to subsidize his tuition. It is reported that Zu Zhengang is preparing to go abroad and yesterday published a "Farewell Letter to Deaf Compatriots," the original text of which is as follows: "Dear deaf and mute compatriots: I am now speaking as a deaf and mute compatriot and a standing director of the Chinese Association for the Deaf and Mute. I sincerely hope that we will truly understand the suffering of our deaf and mute compatriots in China in terms of life and career. Therefore, our more than four million deaf and mute compatriots must understand and respect each other, and jointly assume responsibility and work hard to seek happiness for the deaf and mute masses, so as to easily gain the sympathy and attention of enlightened people in general society, so that we can enjoy freedom and rights equally with ordinary people. This is indeed our unanimous appeal and demand.

Not Allowed to Enroll

The problems of deaf and mute compatriots seeking education and employment in the country are very serious, and marriage is even more difficult, resulting in losses to the country and society. Because I once asked the educational authorities for the opportunity to enroll during the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Chen Lifu once approved a loan and allowed me to study at the National Art College and the National Ninth Middle School, but the principals of these schools did not accept me as a student. Their reason was that they believed that deaf and mute people are not healthy and cannot be taught. Therefore, I made the greatest determination to dedicate myself to the welfare of the deaf and mute. My hope is that the deaf and mute in our country will have more opportunities for education and employment every day, so that we can have the opportunity to obtain freedom and happiness in the future.

Special Permission to Study Abroad

I have been working in the Statistics Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs since 1942, and it has been four and a half years now. In January of this year, I received special permission from the New York School for the Deaf and Mute in the United States to be an exceptional student. Later, the Washington College for the Deaf and Mute in the United States sent a letter also welcoming me to enroll. Marshal Marshall once helped me. General Oderlun, the Canadian Ambassador to China, forwarded it to me, which was a personal letter from Canadian Prime Minister King encouraging me to work hard and make progress. In particular, Gu Zhenggang, Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, approved my application to study in the United States at public expense with great enthusiasm and sympathy. Zhu Jiahua, Minister of the Ministry of Education, and Hang Liwu, Vice Minister, also enthusiastically cultivated me.

Bright Future

I have received letters from deaf and mute friends in various countries and learned that the Netherlands has established a Happiness Promotion Association, which is developing very well. Washington, D.C., in the United States also has deaf and mute organizations, which have enabled American deaf and mute people to enjoy happy lives. Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, has a deaf and mute school with the most complete facilities. The teaching methods are very scientific, which can enable students to progress rapidly. It can be seen that the deaf and mute in various countries have made great strides in education and employment, which makes us feel infinitely bright.

Opportunity to Study

During the Anti-Japanese War, the General Association of the Chinese Deaf and Mute Association was located in Chongqing, which was an important center for the organization of deaf and mute compatriots throughout the country. Now that we have won, the Association will soon move to Nanjing, because the government has already returned to the capital. However, the deaf and mute supplementary class attached to the General Association has received donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life in Chongqing. The class is preparing to reorganize into a formal school so that deaf and mute compatriots in general can have the opportunity to study freely. Now the Association feels an even greater lack of talent, so the Association urgently needs outstanding deaf and mute talent to strengthen its work and promote its cause, so it warmly welcomes participation. If you wish to participate, please send your name, place of origin, family situation, age, address, education level, and a two-inch photo to Comrade Liao Zhi, Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance, Zhongshan East Road, Nanjing, or Comrade Peng Xigeng, Statistics Office, Examination Committee, Shiyuan Road, Nanjing for verification, but you must have a face-to-face interview with Comrades Liao and Peng.

Now I am preparing to go abroad. I would like to meet you after I return to China in the future. I wish you good health and happiness. Goodbye!"

### Monthly Household Registration Statistics Report: Method for Calculating Population Increase and Decrease - Clarified by the Ministry of Interior -

Regarding the revised detailed rules for the implementation of household registration, the population increase and decrease section of the attached monthly household registration statistics report form is divided into four items: immigration, emigration, birth, and death. The meaning of immigration and emigration has been clearly stipulated in Articles 27 and 28 of the revised Household Registration Law. However, population increase and decrease is not limited to the above four items. Any of the circumstances in each clause of Articles 18 and 19 of the same law can also cause population changes.

The original table included immigration, emigration, birth, and death in the increase and decrease column. How should it be calculated? It is reported that the Jiangxi Provincial Government once consulted the Ministry of Interior for clarification, roughly stating that population increase and decrease includes two types: natural increase and decrease due to birth and death, and non-natural increase and decrease due to immigration and emigration. Articles 18 and 19 of the Household Registration Law stipulate that, except for Article 18, Clause 1, which should be registered as a birth, and Article 19, Clause 1, which should be registered as a death, the remaining clauses involve two types of registration for the same event. In addition to registration for establishment of household, removal of household, marriage, divorce, recognition, and adoption, registration for emigration or immigration should be done separately.

The immigration and emigration columns of the monthly household registration statistics report form attached to the detailed rules for the implementation of household registration summarize all non-natural increases and decreases in population. Therefore, in addition to birth and death, all registration populations related to various increases and decreases in population should be included in the calculation. It is also reported that the Ministry of Interior has issued separate letters to the provincial and municipal governments, instructing them to inform them accordingly.

### President Chiang's Visit to Taiwan: An Outside Account

— Taiwan Air News, October 26, Our Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

The news of the Head of State's visit to Taiwan came as early as the beginning of the month when the Taiwan Tribute Group returned to the province, but no one expected him to arrive suddenly on the 21st.

According to Propaganda Committee Chairman Xia, the Lishi Society's Taiwan branch sent someone from the head office. When the Beijing-Shanghai-Ping-Kun reporters were still staying in the Caoshan and Beitou hot spring areas, the officials learned about it, but it was not confirmed. While some reporters took a plane back to Shanghai first (on the 19th), a telegram came, saying that the Chairman would arrive in Taiwan in the afternoon. The Provincial Party Department was holding a Party affairs work review meeting. At about 2:00 PM, the officials went to Songshan Airport with Chief Secretary Li Yizhong, Garrison Commander Chief of Staff Ke Yuanfen, Youth League Director Li Youbang, and Provincial Assembly Speaker Huang Chaoqin. Following them were General Affairs Director Chen Xizeng and Director Yu Jishi, and 25 others. Some of them stayed at Caoshan, and some stayed at the Lishi Society.

At 3:45 PM on the 21st, the Meiling landed at the airport with the Chairman and his wife. The Chairman smiled and said to the welcoming people, "Good, good!" After receiving flowers, the Madam turned to Secretary-General Ge to talk. After taking the first step in visiting Taiwan Province, the great Supreme Leader took a car to the headquarters!

The Head of State's headquarters is located in the Guanbin Hotel in Caoshan. This is a quiet hot spring area with a climate that is 5 degrees lower than Taipei. The mountain road is a wide, high-grade road surface, and the hotel is both elegant and quiet. In the past, the Japanese rulers used it as a palace to welcome Emperor Showa, but now it is the residence of our victorious leader of the Anti-Japanese War!

At about 12:00 PM on the 22nd, Madam Chiang appeared in the most prosperous area of Taipei City - Wenwu Street. She was lightly dressed and traveled simply. Passers-by stepped forward to look up at her. The Madam wore a black coat, a special gold-edged black leather bag, and high-heeled shoes, and her attitude was calm. She was deeply impressed by the simplicity of the Lishi Society when she was there.

The 25th was the Taiwan Retrocession Day. On this day last year, Chief Executive Chen Yi represented the Chairman in accepting the surrender of the Japanese at Zhongshan Hall. On this day this year, the Chairman and his wife personally visited the hall to receive the warm welcome of the provincial compatriots!

The Chairman and his wife, accompanied by Chief Executive Chen and his wife, went to the welcome meeting. The applause from the bottom of the hearts of more than 3,000 people sounded like thunder and lasted for five minutes when the Chairman appeared in front of the crowd. Outside the venue, the cheers of tens of thousands of people never stopped.

The Chairman took a jeep and stood and saluted the people who welcomed him along the way. A kind of great and kind appeal was deeply imprinted in the minds of everyone.

Inside the meeting, the Chairman stood on the stage, and the people were moved to tears by his great and solemn image. People faced the Supreme Leader, recalling his efforts to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will for the nation. His pale hair had won the highest honor of a great man. When he waved his hand with a smile and said, "Thank you everyone, thank you fellow countrymen," he was as kind as an elder to everyone. Yes, he is the elder of every Chinese person. He told the crowd that attending the Retrocession Day meeting in Taiwan was the most gratifying thing in his life, because for 51 years, the Chairman had fulfilled his wish to restore Taiwan, which he had cherished since Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Therefore, when Speaker Huang Chaoqin delivered a congratulatory speech, Head of State Chiang nodded with a smile!

At 11:10 AM on the same morning, the Chairman and his wife appeared on the podium of the first Provincial Games at the Taiwan University sports field. Facing the Chairman was a large portrait of the Chairman, appearing remotely across the square in front of tens of thousands of young people. Hao Gengsheng, sports supervisor of the Ministry of Education, told reporters that this was the third time the Chairman had attended the Games, and he always attended without fail. The Chairman attaches great importance to national health!

After leaving the podium, he helped his wife down the stairs and went to the Taipei City First Guest House for rest. This guest house was formerly the residence of the Japanese Governor-General, and General He Yingqin also stayed here when he visited Taiwan before.

The Chairman's visit to Taiwan is not only the glory of the 6.3 million compatriots in Taiwan, but also the glory of the people throughout the country. The people welcomed the Supreme Leader who recovered the lost land and returned Taiwan to the motherland with the most enthusiastic emotions.

Ode to President Chiang's Sixtieth Birthday

### Northeast Water Conservancy Projects

— Shenyang Air Dispatch, October 25th, Special Correspondent Han Qingtao

Vast fields of agricultural produce and thriving industry and mining have created the wealth of the Northeast, but the people suffer from disaster, reduced to begging with golden bowls, because the rivers frequently overflow and cause harm. Water conservancy projects have not been fully utilized and developed. This year, the lower reaches of the Liao River alone suffered a disaster, and residents of the Panshan area are estimated to have lost as much as 5 billion Northeast circulating yuan. There are still places where the floodwaters have not receded, leaving the people in dire straits!

When the Japanese occupied the Northeast, they established the puppet Manchukuo regime and implemented the so-called continental policy, immigrating and cultivating, and vigorously managing it. Initially, the Songhua River basin was the center of colonization, gradually extending southward to the Liao River basin, and then gradually expanding to the Andong area. Later, because the Songhua River and Liao River were successively flooded in 1933 and 1935, causing great losses, they realized the importance of river regulation.

At the same time, agricultural production increases and heavy industry development are inextricably linked to water conservancy. Therefore, they were determined to establish water conservancy institutions extensively, engaging in surveying and measurement of various rivers, as well as hydrological observation, and formulating construction and management plans for flood control, irrigation, navigation, hydropower, and canal excavation, and began construction. Until the Japanese surrendered on August 15th, the above work never stopped. The scale of their projects, the breadth of the planned scope, the amount of human and financial resources invested, the speed of implementation, and the magnitude of the results are all worthy of our attention!

Water Conservancy Design and Management

Since the enemy puppets attached importance to water conservancy construction in 1933, they formulated the "Comprehensive Northeast River Management Plan." To implement and complete the plan, they successively established the "Water Management Survey Office," "Flood Control and Land Development Bureau," "Agricultural Land Development Bureau," "Manchurian Colonization Corporation," and "Central Water Conservancy Association." In addition, there were eleven engineering offices in Zhangwu, Jinzhou, Yingkou, Mudanjiang, Yilin, Jilin, Nenjiang, Hulun, Heihe, Dongning, and Hunchun, responsible for flood control, irrigation, drainage, hydropower, dike consolidation, and canal port surveys, as well as surveying, design, and implementation for all rivers in the Northeast. By the time of the Japanese surrender, the entire Liao River comprehensive management plan had been completed, and the Songhua River comprehensive management plan was five or six tenths complete. The remaining rivers were still in the data collection stage, and no management plans had been started.

The aforementioned planned programs that have been designed and implemented include: (1) In terms of hydrology: 874 hydrological and meteorological stations have been established, and years of measurement records have been printed into books. (2) In terms of water storage and flood control: a total of 19 reservoirs are planned to be built, of which three have been completed: the Dedai on the Liu River, the Xiaofengman on the Second Songhua River, and the Jingbo Lake on the Mudan River. Three reservoirs, on the Dongliao River, Taizi River, and Hun River, are under construction and have not been completed. (3) In terms of irrigation and drainage: the total area of projects under construction but not completed is 2,932,529 mu, and the area that has been completed and has water conservancy effects is 4,440,205 mu. (4) In terms of dike consolidation: the planned length of dikes to be repaired and consolidated is 5,972 kilometers, of which about half have been repaired and consolidated.

In addition, large-scale projects such as hydropower generation, canal excavation, and port construction will be reported in detail below.

Northeast Port Facilities

Apart from the ports of Dalian and Lushun, which have been improved due to international relations, the remaining ports, such as Dadong, Andong, Yingkou, and Huludao, were all planned to be improved during the enemy's occupation. However, due to their external aggression, all human and financial resources were used for military-related undertakings. Therefore, for more than ten years, there has been no active construction project for the management of the ports of Yingkou, Andong, and Huludao.

The Japanese believed that the development of Dadong Port was beneficial to wartime transportation between Japan and puppet Manchukuo, and that the port had excellent natural conditions and the conditions for establishing an industrial city. Therefore, in 1937, the South Manchuria Railway and the puppet Manchukuo government jointly invested in the project.

The construction plan of Dadong Port is divided into three parts: first, the harbor and wharf warehouse project, with the goal of building a harbor where ships with a deadweight of 4,000 tons and a draft of 7.4 meters can freely navigate at mid-tide level, and a wharf and warehouse capable of loading and unloading four cargo ships simultaneously; second, building an industrial city covering an area of 176 square kilometers, capable of accommodating one million people; third, constructing a 24-kilometer railway project from Dadong to Andong. The extent to which the above plans have been completed is currently unknown due to lack of information.

Opening North-South Canals

The canals planned to be opened by the Japanese puppets are two: one is the waterway connecting Shenyang, Anshan, and Yingkou—referred to by the enemy puppets as the South Manchuria Canal, and the other is the Songliao Canal, which runs through the north-south water system. The former was planned by the Japanese in 1935 and completed in 1940. After detailed research on the water use issue, it was considered that there was no need to worry, but construction had not yet begun. As for the latter, it was in the data collection stage, and there was no specific plan to be examined.

The southern canal of the Northeast is the general name for the canal connecting the cities of Yingkou, Anshan, and Shenyang, with a total length of 219 kilometers. Its route is from Yingkou to Tangmazhai, 93 kilometers long, and from there to Shenyang, 102 kilometers long, and to Anshan, 24 kilometers long. In the entire route, the newly opened river channel is 86 kilometers long, the Taizi River channel is 95 kilometers long, and the lower Liao River channel is 38 kilometers long. In order to regulate the water level difference of each river channel, it is planned to build eleven ship locks.

Various Water Conservancy Projects

The cross-sectional bottom width of the Southern Canal plan is 20 meters, the water surface width is 30 meters, and the slope of the two banks is 1:25 meters. It is estimated that once this project is completed, 600-ton steamships can travel smoothly day and night. The total budget for this project was estimated at 26,190,000 puppet Manchukuo yuan in 1940. How many times more would it cost to do it now?

In the past, most of the cultivated land in the Northeast was dry land. Since the Japanese used Koreans to plant paddy fields, many Chinese have also followed suit. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese set up institutions such as the "Agricultural Land Development Bureau" to promote the immigration policy, presiding over the opening of paddy fields. The paddy fields that have been created and are planned to be opened are distributed in the main agricultural areas of the Songliao water system. Among them, the larger ones include the Dongliao River irrigation area, the Liao River main stream irrigation area, the Haicheng River drainage area, the Hun River irrigation area, the Songhua River drainage and irrigation area, the Mudanjiang drainage and irrigation area, the Wo Ken River irrigation area, the Ussuri River irrigation area, the Yalu River irrigation area, and the Panshan land improvement area. There are many other large and small farmland water conservancy projects scattered in various river basins. Among them, except for a few smaller projects that have been fully completed, the remaining large irrigation areas have only been partially completed. We must shoulder this heavy burden.

The Northeast has a vast territory and abundant resources, and is especially rich in mineral products and industrial raw materials. In order to plunder and develop these, and to save energy, the Japanese actively sought the development of water power. This work began in 1934. As of August 1945, a total of 45 sites had been obtained that could be used to build dams for water storage and power generation. The total expected average power generation is 3,274,000 kilowatts. Among them, the Xiaofengman on the Songhua River, the Jingbo Lake on the Mudan River, and the Shuifeng Hydropower Plant on the Yalu River have been successively constructed and largely completed. The Yunfeng and Weiyuan on the Yalu River, the Huanren on the Hun River, and the Shenwo on the Taizi River have been under construction but not completed. The rest have not yet been handled. The ones that have been successful are already considerable if the machinery is not damaged or moved away. If each one is completed, it would be a truly great power undertaking!

The larger rivers in the Northeast are mostly silted and shallow in the south, and mostly rocky and dangerous in the north. Therefore, before the September 18th Incident, although their lower reaches were navigable, they were all navigable with great difficulty, relying on their natural conditions. There were no detailed statistics on the mileage of navigable waterways. Since 1932, in order to strengthen plunder and cooperate with land transportation, the Japanese carried out major repairs, using the Liao River as the main trunk in the south and the Songhua River as the main trunk in the north, and also including the border rivers Yalu River, Ussuri River, and Heilongjiang. They engaged in projects such as adding dikes, dredging shallows, blasting rocks, building weirs to channel water, and building dams to store floods. By the summer of 1942, there were 7,139 kilometers of navigable waterways for steamships and 4,524 kilometers for wooden boats. In order to strengthen control, the enemy puppets had established three navigation bureaus in Harbin, Yingkou, and Andong to manage matters such as ship piloting and navigation marks in different areas, and opened regular shipping routes to various ports. Therefore, Northeast shipping was said to be developed by the Japanese. However, since the restoration, the river channels have gradually fallen into disrepair, and ships have been lost. It will not be easy to restore the old appearance without re-organizing the river channels and adding new ships.

Current Issues

Although the current situation in the Northeast is not completely stable, there are already many water conservancy projects that can be implemented in the plains of the Liao River and Songhua River water systems. There are even more projects that should be carried out in the future. According to the person in charge of the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Water Conservancy Commission, according to the current situation of water conservancy in the Northeast, the urgent matters for water conservancy construction in the future are: First, to restore hydrological and meteorological observation stations: There are 874 hydrological and meteorological observation stations in the Northeast. After the Japanese surrendered, they have all been suspended. It is a pity that records have been interrupted for a year. The office has now started an investigation and will restore them separately within the possible scope of locations. It is estimated that more than 100 stations can be set up in the areas occupied by the national army, and the rest will be restored gradually.

Second, strengthen the maintenance and management of completed projects: Projects completed during the puppet Manchukuo period, such as the dikes of the Da River, the reservoirs of the Liu River, and irrigation projects in various places, should be well maintained and managed to avoid destruction. According to the dikes in the lower reaches of the Liao River and its large and small tributaries, except for the Raoyang River, more than 3,000 kilometers have been completed. However, in recent years, they have not been maintained and repaired, resulting in more than 100 breaches this year, and the seven or eight counties in the affected areas have suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the maintenance and management of completed projects must be strengthened. Third, complete the water conservancy projects that were started but not completed during the puppet Manchukuo period. When the enemy puppets surrendered last year, those that had been started but not completed and those that had been damaged should be resumed and completed in a timely manner.

Water conservancy projects in the Northeast have been deeply valued and operated purely by the Japanese puppets, sparing no effort. The losses caused by the suspension and abandonment of these projects in the past year are impossible to count. According to the statistics of the Northeast Administrative Economic Committee, this year, only the rice production is only 17% of the normal output. Therefore, all parties expect water conservancy projects to be actively developed. The Northeast Branch of the Executive Headquarters, the Northeast Office of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the provincial and municipal governments have repeatedly discussed the resumption of water conservancy projects in various places with the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Water Conservancy Commission, and are willing to bear part of the construction costs and materials or manpower, hoping to promote the matter as soon as possible. For this arduous task, the Water Conservancy Commission should establish a permanent institution in the Northeast as soon as possible to take over the responsibility, so that the water conservancy construction in the Northeast will not only not gradually become desolate after we take over, but also achieve "full utilization of water and land," which is crucial to the national economy and the people's livelihood!

### Interlude of the Jining Battle

— Fengzhen News, October 6th, Special Correspondent Liu Yingyuan

The Great Achievements of Xing Guanjun

Chief Fu said very humbly about the victory of the Jining Battle: "This is the success of the people's will." In fact, the people certainly need a victorious Jining Battle, and to achieve the people's will, there must also be a good army to carry it out. The brilliant results of the 12th War Zone this time can be said to be entirely based on precise training, good military discipline, and strong morale of officers and soldiers. To illustrate this factor, we would like to cite a figure as a representative of the officers and soldiers of the 12th War Zone. Who is this representative? It is Major Xing Guanjun, the captain of the Second Company of the Third Battalion of the "Victory" Detachment, who occupied Tie Jun Mountain, counterattacked Wolong Mountain, and died in the assault on the city on September 12th.

The name Xing Guanjun caused a sensation in every barracks on the left flank of the national defense as early as the Baotou Battle in 1939. He was from Xiliu Village, Hunyuan, Shanxi, and was also from a military family. His great-grandfather Xing Wenxing was a martial arts Jinshi and served as a general under Luo Enju during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, suppressing the Miao rebellion in the southwest. However, by the time of his grandfather, the family gradually declined, so he drifted to

Fengzhen when he was thirteen years old; he first served as a soldier in the 68th Division, and joined the 35th Army in Houtao when Sun Dianying was put down in 1934. After the Anti-Japanese War, he was promoted from bugler to warrant officer squad leader. Because of the Baotou Battle, he occupied a Caishenmiao Street with a copper bugle, ten national flags, and six hand grenades, and he was the first to take down Shixing Elementary School in the Wuyuan Battle. Chief Chuan promoted him to major company commander out of turn.

Guanjun not only knew how to fight, but also treated his comrades as brothers on weekdays, training them all to be lively and energetic, and everyone knew how to fight. His company was enough for ten companies to use. During the Jining Battle, he was also the first to put the national flag on the top of Tie Jun Mountain. Seeing that the Second "Victory" Battalion could not take down Wolong Mountain, he led a company through a hail of machine gun fire, and took down Wolong Mountain again from the enemy's rear. After the "Victory" Detachment soldiers died in the assault on the city on the 12th, they issued a sad cry of "Revenge for Xing Guanjun" and rushed into the southwest corner of the city in one breath. Chief Chuan renamed Tie Jun Mountain Guanjun Mountain in memory of Xing Guanjun's great achievements. The "Victory" Detachment Commander said with tears in his eyes to the people: "Xing Guanjun was only twenty-nine years old this year. He had just gotten engaged in Taolin, but he canceled it before leaving. He came into this world, really, to live for the country and to die for the country."

Errata

The explanation about Taiwan in the Weekly Pictorial of this newspaper on October 26, line 13: "It was the thirteenth year of Tongzhi, 1894 in the Western calendar," is an error for "It was the twenty-first year of Guangxu, 1895 in the Western calendar." This is hereby corrected.

Spring and Autumn

### Record of Returning Home in Poetry

— Lü Baihua

Before the Trip

I have a bit of hatred for chalk, because the life of chalk is mixed with coal smoke and dust, making me tired. All that remains of the scenery of my hometown, immersed in the greenery of mountains and the ripples of water, is a vague dream image. This semester, Zhijiang moved back to its old nest in Hangzhou. Although it is closer to my hometown, there is no way to give up my home in Shanghai, and it is difficult enough to support a family of eight with chalk. So I still left teaching to go into business. I will never forget five years ago, when life was peaceful, teaching and researching my own interests. But soon, enemy cavalry invaded even this clean land under the amulet. At that time, I was at Daxia, and I got a line of poetry in a dream: "A thousand years of sitting, the old Buddha is merciless." When I woke up, I completed a seven-character律 poem. I remember writing it on the blackboard for the students to see. The last two lines were "The cunning Xia meet in the double eight numbers, and only see grass and smoke in Si Gan." The double eight numbers refer to 8.13 and 12.8. Since then, I have retired into business, and poetry has not been made. What has been made is only a school of worry and anger, the so-called "My heart is like the dry land of Liling, and my hair is like the messy silk of Suiyang." And Li Bake, in his preface to my "A Dust of Grass," said, "For the eight years of sorrow and depression, everyone has witnessed the scars and disasters and changed their poetry." Scars, I am one of them. I think, eight years later, I can always return to the peaceful life of the past, but the high pressure of the whip of life is still the same. Chalk is not possible, and the dream of home cannot be found. It is autumn, and I miss even more the ancient hometown city at the end of the sky. I heard that my home has really become four walls, because all the utensils, even a piece of wood and a stone, have been stolen and sold by unworthy members of the same clan. Even the property rights have been shaken, which makes me have to return. Before the trip, my heart should contain a component of joy, but it is so confused and turning over.

Tired dreams of the world are immeasurable,

A short rest tomorrow to cross the Qiantang;

My heart is happy only for the sake of the journey home,

Waiting to see the faint light break through the paper window.

Passing Songjiang

It seems to be "like a bird escaping from a cage, and returning to nature." As the train drove to the distant suburbs, passing through the plains, forests, and green mountains, surrounded by blue waves, yes, it was a picture of nature that I had not seen for many years. Although I had not closed my eyes all night last night, I was still very excited. I kept staring around, not willing to let a single blade of grass or a cloud easily pass through my sight. Soon, the car arrived at Songjiang Station.

Songjiang is a large station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and it is also a place worthy of lingering and reminiscing in the eyes of later generations. Because this is where the story of "Zhang Han" takes place. Zhang Han, also known as Jiying, was from Songjiang. It was also such an autumn, when the autumn wind rose, he suddenly thought of his hometown, Songjiang's water shield and perch, so he resigned and returned home. Therefore, water shield and perch have become famous products of Songjiang. In fact, this "fame" is only沾ed光 by that story. The immortal poet Li Taibai also sang it in his poem "This trip is not for the perch slices, but to love the famous mountains and enter Shanzhong." As for Zhang Han's homesickness, it was not really for the water shield and perch. He was a man who knew the situation and felt that there would be no good results if he continued to be greedy, so he took the opportunity to leave, with the meaning of "protecting oneself wisely."

In the present, this kind of thinking is naturally not acceptable, but with a heart that is greedy for official positions, there is an excessive greed, and what takes shape is a团糟, who is willing to have Zhang Jiying's autumn wind on the river homesickness!

The river flows here to talk about water shield and perch,

Not suspending the car to protect oneself,

A thousand years of autumn wind, a vain sandal,

Coming back to bow, whom else?

### Me and the Mirror

— Su Dan

As a child, I was as interested in mirrors as I was in flying kites and fighting crickets. How that interest arose, it is difficult to say now. But it was always due to curiosity, why is it so shiny and spotless? Why can it reflect people's faces and other things without any distortion? Such questions have been asked. Although I asked my mother and father, my mother's answer was very vague, and what my father said was the word mercury reflection, which was not very clear in my mind. So when I encountered a mirror, I always had strange thoughts.

There was an olive-shaped mirror on the dressing table in my mother's room, so when I came back from school, I threw down my schoolbag and went to the dressing table to make a few funny faces in the mirror: sticking out my tongue, pouting, shrugging my eyebrows and winking, all kinds of funny faces. And the most common thing to do was to use both hands to pull my eyes and mouth open at the same time, a so-called cat face, and after meowing a few times like a cat, I would run outside to play. Interestingly, sometimes when I quarreled with my classmates at school, I had several ink marks on my face when I came back, but I often forgot to go to the mirror to look at it, and I didn't remember the mirror until others laughed at me. In addition, when I was happy, I would run into the room and make funny faces in the mirror. Especially after getting something to eat from my mother, chewing in front of the mirror, watching my own mouth, arching up very high like a pig eating, seemed to be the thing I felt most interested in.

Sometimes, when I was playing happily with a group of playmates in the sun, I suddenly thought of something, sneaked into my mother's room, secretly touched and brought out that oval mirror, pointed it at the sun, reflected its light on the white wall, and watched the ball of white light from afar, and then looked at the surprised and admiring eyes of my playmates around me, I was really happy. With a wave of my hand, the white light on the wall flickered. When I was excited, I even used it to shine on my playmates' faces, telling them not to dare to open their eyes and lower their heads. Other animals such as cats, dogs, chickens, ducks, and pigs have all been shone, and even the sparrows singing peacefully under the eaves have often been scared away by my beam of white light.

This practice has a source; at that time, I was reading some fairy tales, sword fairies, knights, demons, etc., filling my mind. I knew there was something called "demon-revealing mirror," and all demons and ghosts would show their true form under it. So I imitated it myself, comparing myself to a god, and regarded the mirror in my hand as a magic weapon for subduing demons.

Naturally, this kind of plaything was forbidden by my mother. Occasionally, when my mother found out, I was always scolded, and the mirror in my hand was taken away. I knew that my mother didn't allow me to play like this, not entirely because she was afraid that I would accidentally drop and break the mirror, but she also seemed to know that she was doing it for something, but I couldn't figure out what this "something" was. As soon as it was dusk and the room was dark, my mother would turn her olive-shaped mirror upside down on the table. This action became her habit, and she would never forget it. I have asked what the reason for this is, and not just once or twice, but I have never received an answer. Sometimes she even scolded: "Don't talk too much." So, what is the mirror used for after all? I was even more confused. And the mirror became even more mysterious in my mind.

As I grew older, the mystery of the mirror in my heart gradually melted away like the early spring snow. I no longer felt strange about my mother's action of turning the mirror upside down at night. My mother's mind was caught by the idea of superstition in ghosts and gods, and turning the mirror upside down was to avoid taboos. I no longer stood in front of the mirror making funny faces or taking it in the sun to shine on people and dogs and cats. It is natural to think wildly to make others show their true colors. Now, occasionally when I recall this, I really feel funny. Isn't the consciousness of childhood purely a realm of dreams?

I think this way: What is the great use of a mirror? All that it gives to people or things is a relief reproduction. Everything that exists has its own inherent factors of existence. Therefore, I don't love mirrors anymore. Just like I don't like a frivolous and deceitful person.

Three years ago, I left home and ran to Chongqing, wading through mountains and rivers, and I still carried a jade-colored mirror in my luggage. Now that I have come to Shanghai, this mirror is still hanging on the wall in my bedroom. Because it has been through many years, one of its feet has been broken, and its shape and color have changed greatly. But I don't feel any regret because of this. Except for combing my hair or having to tidy up my clothes, I don't pay much attention to it after waving it in front of it. Because I think that the me in the mirror may not be me. You have to look deeper to find yourself.

### Inscription on the Bamboo Pond Picture

— Pan Gongzhan

Brother Qingyang showed me the Bamboo Pond Picture, which is elegant and otherworldly, with a lot of the joy of mountains and forests. I rashly inscribed a quatrain:

Grass fills the outskirts and water fills the pond, the Xiao wind rises and enters the secluded path; I remember the joy of childhood when I saw the picture, going out together and treading on the green grass all day long.

### Inscription on the Picture of Two Old Men Watching the Waterfall

— Sun Qingyang

Gift to Mr. Pan Gongzhan

Frosty leaves fall quietly, the autumn mountains gradually feel cold,

The clear spring is still clean and white, rushing out of the secluded rock;

The elders have strange quirks, and their travels reach this place,

They especially love the scenery of the forest, lingering and reluctant to return;

There are many heroic deeds in the world, and they no longer look at the true mountains.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 80

— Ye Jingfeng

With this excuse of delivering a message, we also made the most of the opportunity to say things she liked to hear. She was very happy, complaining that we hadn't been to the village in so long that we had become strangers. Taking advantage of this, we asked her to find us a quiet place to rest. She thought for a moment and suggested "Zhaoxian Hall," which was very quiet before 3 o'clock; after 3 o'clock, the gambling would start, and the girls would be on the market, making it very lively. We told her that we hadn't had a good rest all night and needed a place to lie down, and that we didn't want to join in the fun. She said that if we didn't mind the condition, we could go to her room, where there was a large kang (heated brick bed) and no one would bother us. This was a very ideal place. We gave her two military scrip in advance, ostensibly to ask her to arrange two bowls of zhajiang noodles for us.

When this woman said, "if you don't mind the condition," I thought she was being polite. It wasn't until she led us into this room that I realized she was telling the truth. This room not only deserved the word "condition," but first of all, it was not ventilated. The adjacent room was the kitchen, and the smell of cooking oil and coal smoke constantly seeped through the cracks in the partition wall, making one feel nauseous. Tiger Brother called it the "nineteenth layer of oily smoke hell." But we ate the noodles here and discussed the things we were preparing to do.

Our first step was to draw a simplified map of the terrain inside the prohibited area. Based on the information provided by Lao Kuai, we made a rough estimate of the routes, obstacles, gasoline dumps, armories, guard posts, entertainment venues, etc. We argued about one point: Tiger Brother wanted to sneak into the entertainment venue and kill Yin, the traitor, while I advocated acting according to the situation. Destroying the armory or gasoline depot would be enough to diminish the enemy's arrogance and give them a blow. I used the dialectical method of pros and cons to convince Tiger Brother. Because although Yin, the traitor, was a source of trouble, his life was not worth a dog's life. Even if we got rid of him, the Japanese could immediately install another puppet.

Next, we discussed the method of retreat. In my imagination, I believed that the safest way was for the deed to be exposed only after we had retreated, which was the best strategy. We had to understand that this was a tiger's den, and no matter how powerful we were, we only had two legs and two hands. In any case, we should avoid obvious conflicts as much as possible.

Before the retreat problem was solved, Tiger Brother had already fallen on the kang and fallen into a deep sleep. I was also finding it hard to keep my eyes open, but because of the dangerous environment, I had to force myself to stay awake. This situation was even more difficult than fighting guerrilla warfare outside the customs. When fighting guerrilla warfare, although we were exposed to the sun, wind, rain, and cold, we had plenty of fresh air. This room, not to mention fresh air, was not even ventilated, and the oily smoke in the air could almost be grabbed in handfuls; moreover, the weather was unusually hot and stuffy, almost suffocating or causing heatstroke.

I don't remember when I also fell asleep on the kang, only knowing that I was sleeping soundly when I was suddenly awakened by a loud noise. I sat up with a start, my heart pounding uncontrollably; the loud noise was strange, constantly echoing in my ears. After calming down a little and listening carefully, I realized that it was the sound of gongs and drums, coming from the adjacent room, making my head spin. At the same time, I felt very uncomfortable all over, inexplicably uncomfortable. "Am I sick?" I thought to myself, but after a slight touch, I couldn't help but laugh, realizing that the clothes on my body were soaked through with sweat, sticking to my body. I looked at Tiger Brother, who was still sleeping soundly. I touched his forehead, which was dry and without a trace of sweat. Later, I heard that this was because he had practiced qigong.

After a lot of effort, I finally understood that this room was a dark room; one side connected to the kitchen, and the other was the "Zhaoxian Hall" club. Usually, Peking opera was performed here, or practiced, or sung solo, or Kun opera troupes performed, and sometimes amateurs played for fun, anyway, it was lively and fun. The other two walls were gambling dens. They were also open at this time. The only light in this room, twenty-four hours a day, came from a few skylights on the roof and a small five-candlepower light bulb.

### Hard and Soft

— Shao Fu

A peanut vendor in Hong Kong was kicked to death by an Indian policeman. Although the Indian policeman has been handed over to the authorities for interrogation, the resentment of all the residents remaining in Hong Kong has not subsided, and it may cause a larger storm. In the seventeenth issue of the News World Monthly, which was published the day before yesterday, there was an article entitled "Blood and Sweat Gold Nourishes Hong Kong," which is sufficient to provide us with a reference for understanding the policies of the local government. There is this section:

Right on the pier of the Star Ferry, a Royal Navy sailor triumphantly raised a glass bottle and smashed it against the head of a well-dressed young woman. The poor beauty had her head broken and bleeding, and her beautiful face was also cut by the glass. The Royal Navy sailor swaggered away. This represents the "hard" policy. The most successful trick of the policy enforcer on the "soft" side is the recent large-scale distribution of relief food packages from the Red Cross. Each household received one package, unconditionally. The package contained more than a dozen cans, which everyone praised. The bloodstains left by the Royal Navy glass bottle were all covered up by those food packages. This soft and hard policy can be called a "masterpiece" of British rule in the colonies.

The Indian policeman naturally appeared as a ruler; otherwise, how dare he arbitrarily bully the people? Dogs rely on their masters. If the masters' arrogance remains, then this kind of thing will happen more and more in the future. Naturally, the Hong Kong authorities are now trying their best to use soft tactics in this case.

Recovering Hong Kong is one of the goals we should strive for according to reason, but what is even more important is to change the imperialist ideas of those who consider themselves to be superior races.

### Youth is Wasted for Love: The Windsors are Old

— Qian Fanfu

When Edward Windsor was born on June 23, 1894, he was already the son of a duke. He received a good family education from an early age. At the age of thirteen, he entered the naval academy as a cadet. After two years of training, he was promoted to midshipman and underwent three months of sea training on a cruiser. When he was sixteen, his father George V ascended the throne, and Windsor became the crown prince, still serving in the navy. His character was gentle and sincere, and his youthful life at sea broadened his mind. He was the first of the British royal family to love to travel. From his travels, he experienced the real life outside the court. He once said: "The sea is my religion." What he sought was only the life of an ordinary person. He was enthusiastic about studying ways to improve unemployment and slum housing problems. He could not stand the arrogance and arrogance of the aristocracy. Therefore, the royal women he met in the social arena only felt hypocritical and ridiculous. Until the age of forty-two, he still lived a single life.

Let us turn the clock back to 1895. In the northeast of Washington, D.C., in the United States, in the city of Potomac, a girl named Peihsi Wallfield was born. Her biological father was the owner of a public office. He died when she was two years old, leaving the girl and her mother to depend on each other for life. The family was poor, which contributed to her floating life. At the age of twenty-one, she married Lieutenant Spencer. The wedding was held on November 8, 1916. Their marital relationship lasted until 1925. Later, she met Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, senior staff of the New York Shipping Company, while playing tennis. Mr. Simpson divorced his wife and married Peihsi in London in 1928. From then on, she became Mrs. Simpson, entering and leaving the social circles of the British capital.

Windsor and Peihsi met at a banquet at this time. At that time, Windsor had already ascended the throne and still maintained his consistent civilian ideas. Peihsi was gentle in demeanor and, because she had experienced the world, the two became close friends in conversation, and their relationship grew stronger. After 1934, the emperor of Great Britain simply could not leave Mrs. Simpson for a moment. In December 1936, the Parliament did not approve of Windsor's marriage to Mrs. Simpson. He would rather give up the throne to obtain marital autonomy, creating discussion material that shocked the world.

On June 3, 1937, they were married in France in the name of the Duke of Windsor and Miss Wallfield. The ceremony was simple, and the total number of guests, including journalists, was only fifty.

Later, the Duke of Windsor was appointed governor of a British island near the Americas. For ten years, there have been constant records in newspapers of various countries about the actions of him and his wife. They returned to England the other day, which was their first return home since September 1939.

The Duke and Duchess of Windsor are both over half a century old this year. They have been married for ten years, and the relationship between the couple has always been loving. Windsor has never regretted losing the throne. Mrs. Windsor looks like she will take her third marriage as her permanent home. They have already established immortal achievements for mankind; they have written the greatness of love into history!

### The Waistline Has Increased

— Zhang Yiren

Amsterdam in the Netherlands is one of the world's famous financial markets. There is a circus there, and the seats have never been numbered. They are uniform benches. During the war, they could accommodate 3,400 spectators. Since the end of the war and the restoration of peace more than a year ago, the circus has only been able to accommodate 3,160 spectators. The circus had to refuse another 250 spectators. This means that the circus authorities have invisibly lost the price of 250 tickets per show!

At first, the person in charge was confused and could not figure it out. Later, he finally knew the secret; he discovered that the average waistline of the Dutch people had increased by three inches in the year since the victory of the war. After all, world peace is conducive to their lives; they no longer need to tighten their belts. They can now enjoy everything in peacetime, so their bodies have also become fatter!

But looking at our countrymen, how much has their waistline increased?

### Dancers and Dance Halls 3

— Jia Mo

According to a recent survey, the total number of dancers registered with the Municipal Police Bureau is 2,032. There are 25 dance halls in the city. (There are also small dance halls that have not been listed). Their names and the number of dancers assigned to them are as follows:

Xianle 46 people

Paramount 30 people

Metropolitan 36 people

Vienna 85 people

Great East 141 people

Venus 99 people

Jinshan 49 people

Imperial Palace 62 people

Saint Tale 25 people

Central 123 people

New Metropolitan 24 people

Dalu 101 people

Huadu 156 people

Lido 70 people

New Xianlin 85 people

Dahu 123 people

MGM 101 people

Dahua 90 people

Xinhua 45 people

Far East 60 people

Yangtze 103 people

Cathay 48 people

United Nations 31 people

Victory 86 people

Gaofeng 58 people

Red Star

The dancers in the dance halls now are divided into two levels: those who sit in seats and those who do not. That is, those who sit in the seats around the dance floor are one type, and those who do not sit in seats and wait for customers to call them to sit are another type. This is the difference between "Red Star" and "Non-Red Star." Generally, the number of Red Stars accounts for about 15 to 18 percent of the total.

To become a Red Star, one needs to excel in "beauty," "art," "social skills," and "style" to pass. They need to have a large number of customers flocking to them and paying fees. But they still cannot rely solely on the income from regular dance tickets to maintain themselves. Because even if they transfer tables six times a night (each ticket averaging 10,000 yuan), at most they can only redeem 30,000 yuan in cash. This is not enough for their huge expenses. Their biggest income still depends on the huge allowances from wealthy customers, and the subtle relationship and exchange conditions in between are naturally worth speculating about by outsiders.

New Grain

In the midst of the soaring prices of all commodities, new grain has been harvested. In theory, farmers can take a breather, but in several rice-producing cities near Shanghai, rice prices are falling day by day, and farmers in the countryside are eager to sell, further creating a situation of poor sales. Indica rice has plummeted to 33,000 yuan per picul. It is said that bank loans to farmers require gold bars in addition to store guarantees. How many people in the countryside can dig out gold bars from the fields? Therefore, under the threat of high prices, farmers have to resort to usurious loans with interest rates of more than three cents. This phenomenon of robbing Peter to pay Paul is probably too late for us to study and formulate some kind of "economic plan for reorganizing the countryside" to carry out rescue work. The cold winter is approaching, and the farming tools have not been repaired. Although people in the cities are now dizzy with milk powder and cod liver oil, our foundation of life will still be built on that vast and fertile land. I wonder if everyone has pondered this reason when they temporarily leave the "glass world" and dream in the middle of the night?

Turning Head Rat

What is Japan like after the war? I am afraid that most of us have forgotten it! The New York Times said: "Among the defeated Axis countries, Japan has the fastest signs of recovery; the Japanese people are still actively strong and capable, and do not seem to be discouraged by the defeat." Most importantly, "the recovery of Japanese industry is sufficient to meet domestic needs and a large number of exports." The Transformation Society also said: "Japan has been ordered to manufacture wool fabrics, which will be exported to distant markets." Perhaps because of these reasons? Bevin, in his speech in the House of Commons, has already made a statement of "being extremely willing to conclude a special and lasting peace with Japan." Ma Chang, the chief writer of the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun, also said with a flourish: "For the sake of creating world peace, the United Nations should store a batch of atomic bombs in Japan and assign the peace-loving Japanese to keep them." Good fellow! Look how energetic they are! Look, haven't they presented the "gold-inlaid wooden box" as a congratulatory gift again? Then those large quantities of wool fabrics manufactured "under orders" will be supplied again! Are we, after being tired of enjoying glazed products, prepared to cheer up again and accept this diligence?

East Wind Westward

The "Self-Reliance Movement for the Disabled" promoted by the United States to promote post-war demobilization has been underway for nearly two years. In the meantime, I don't know how many unnamed heroes who returned injured from the battlefield have received the comfort of precious warmth in the society without regret in the pain of broken limbs and arms. Recently, I heard that their Congress has also passed a bill to implement "National Disability Employment Week," preparing to launch another relief movement on a wider scale based on human compassion and love. It is really unexpected that the so-called prosperous age of "The Book of Rites: The Great Harmony," one of our national quintessence, in which "the elderly, widows, orphans, and the disabled are all provided for," has been preempted by others, doing it in line with the philosophical precepts of our ancestors. Looking back at ourselves: many groups of people who lost their health in the war and became beggars after the victory due to lack of means of survival are begging for survival in the eyes of people who are indifferent, contemptuous, and disgusted, struggling to die. In ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, there is nothing more unfair than this! But now, everything has changed! People are good at adapting to all kinds of sad and tragic phenomena, even if there are some that they don't like, but after seeing them a lot, they get used to them, and everyone feels that it doesn't matter!
