### National Assembly Discusses Rules of Procedure; Chapters 1, 2, and 3 Completed Smoothly This Morning

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Presidium of the General Assembly held its third meeting on the evening of the 25th and passed two resolutions: (1) Regarding the date of the second General Assembly, it was resolved to hold it at 9:00 AM on November 26th, and Representative Yu Youren was appointed as the Chairman of the Assembly. (2) Regarding the Democratic Socialist Party's nomination of Representatives Li Daming and Xu Fulin as members of the Presidium, it was resolved to present this to the second General Assembly for reporting. As for the amendments proposed during the General Assembly on the 25th regarding Chapter 4 of the draft rules of procedure, the suggestions were extensive and profound, and they are still being categorized into oral and written forms, with the aim of presenting them at the second General Assembly on the morning of the 26th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] At 3:20 PM on the 25th, the National Assembly continued its meeting, still presided over by Chairman Chiang. After Hong Youlan reported that there were 1,070 people present, Chairman Chiang requested Hu Shi, the Chairman elected by the Presidium, to report on the decisions of the Presidium meeting held at noon, stating: "Regarding the method of discussing the rules of procedure, after the second Presidium meeting, another discussion was held. It was considered that forming another review committee would be time-consuming and difficult to manage. In the previous discussion on how to generate candidates for the Presidium, most of the review committee members were senior and respected representatives who were reluctant to speak much. Therefore, it was proposed that the General Assembly directly discuss each chapter. This morning, the General Assembly resolved to first submit it for review. After the Presidium held an ad hoc meeting at noon to discuss, considering the practical difficulties of forming another review committee, it was decided to recommend to the General Assembly that the entire body act as the review committee for preliminary review. Now, I ask for your decision." After Hu's report, representatives such as He Foqing from the Henan region spoke successively, generally stating: The Presidium's resolution cannot overturn the General Assembly's resolution. The General Assembly's resolution from the morning should be maintained, and representatives should be nominated by each unit to review. At this point, Chairman Chiang stood up to explain, saying: "The Presidium's suggestion is not to overturn the General Assembly's resolution, but merely to seek the General Assembly's opinion based on the Presidium's view. When the General Assembly is in session, on the one hand, opinions should be widely solicited, and on the other hand, time should also be considered. Replacing the small group review committee with a review committee of the whole allows everyone to have more opportunities to speak. This suggestion is truly absolutely democratic. May I take a vote on this suggestion again?" The proposal was approved by the audience with enthusiastic applause. The vote resulted in 757 votes in favor, passing by a majority. Thus, the entire review committee began its work at 3:40 PM, proceeding with chapter-by-chapter discussion. Those requesting to speak flocked to the podium. For Chapter 1, "General Provisions," some suggested adding a clause to the rules of procedure stating that representatives should not be held responsible for their speeches within the Assembly, while others proposed that there was no need to readjust the seating of the General Assembly representatives and requested that Article 5 be repealed or revised. The former was not established because the General Assembly Organization Law already had a statement on the matter, and the latter was not established because the Presidium believed that there was a practical need to adjust the seating. Chapter 1 was passed as originally worded. In Chapter 2, "Review of Representative Qualifications," it was smoothly passed after Representative Er Yi suggested that a strict investigation should be conducted into representatives who had engaged in acts of betrayal. In Chapter 3, "Meetings," regarding Article 14, the point that a representative's withdrawal would not affect the quorum, some requested that a special provision be made for the quorum for voting on the Constitution. Because the General Assembly Organization Law already stipulated this, a vote was taken with 729 people in favor (out of 1,249 people present), and the original proposal was maintained.

Discussion on "Motions" Chapter - Representatives Speak Enthusiastically

At this point, discussion began on Chapter 4, "Motions," and the atmosphere in the venue became tense. More than eighty representatives presented opinions or expressed them orally. They spoke enthusiastically and delivered impassioned speeches. In the eleven articles of the chapter, except for Articles 21, 23, 25, 27, and 28, there were many proposed amendments. Summarizing the main points of the representatives' speeches, they were roughly as follows: In Article 18, the nature of motions should not be narrowly restricted, and it should be changed to "motions may be freely proposed by all representatives." In Article 19, the motion on the date of implementation of the Constitution should be proposed by the General Assembly representatives according to the Organization Law, and detailed and legal procedures should be made for the government to propose the draft Constitution in order to respect the power of the National Assembly, the highest political organ in the country. Looking at the constitutional history of democratic countries around the world, the draft Constitution is not limited to being proposed by the National Government. In Article 20, there is no need for such special provisions regarding amendments to the draft Constitution and the date of constitutional implementation when they are resubmitted. In Article 22, although the review of the draft Constitution is said to be divided into chapters and groups, the groups should be clearly listed. In Article 24, reducing the number of co-signers required to propose amendments to the draft Constitution and the point that representatives participating in each review group should not propose amendments to the results of their group's review are undemocratic and unreasonable. The minority opinions in the small group may be the majority opinions in the General Assembly. This restriction should be removed or conditionally amended so that those holding minority opinions in each review group have the opportunity to express their reserved opinions in the General Assembly. In Article 26, the point that temporary motions must be in writing and must be co-signed by more than one hundred people does not consider the facts and is unreasonable. Temporary motions should not be limited to writing, and one hundred people should be reduced to the minimum number. Regarding this chapter, the representatives put forward more than one hundred opinions. The General Assembly took a break from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM. The discussion finally concluded at 6:10 PM. Chairman Chiang announced: "The Presidium will hold a meeting after the adjournment to summarize the many opinions on Chapter 4 and present them to the General Assembly on the 26th." Finally, Hong Lanyou reported: "After the meeting, please ask all the Chairmen of the Presidium to gather in the Presidium's lounge. The time for the second General Assembly will be notified after the Presidium decides." The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM, just as dusk was falling and heavy rain was pouring down. This first General Assembly, full of democratic spirit, thus came to an end.

### Details of the Morning Session

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The first General Assembly of the National Assembly began at 10:15 AM on the 25th. The Guofu Road and National Assembly Hall, which had been quiet for two days, became lively again. At 10:12 AM, Chairman Chiang stepped onto the podium and took his seat. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported that 1,604 representatives had registered and 1,248 representatives were present, which was sufficient for a quorum. He announced the opening of the meeting. Everyone stood at attention, and Chairman Chiang led the customary salute and observed a moment of silence to pay respects to the revolutionary martyrs and the soldiers and compatriots who died in the War of Resistance. Then, the reporter read the minutes of the fourth preparatory meeting and letters and telegrams of leave from representatives. Secretary-General Hong reported on the decisions of the second Presidium meeting: (1) The methods and list of Presidium subgroups (see today's newspaper, only Zhou Yongneng of the first group and Ding Weifen of the fifth group were swapped, with no other changes). (2) Rules for attending the National Assembly. (3) According to Representative Sun Mujia et al., fifty-one people, along with the National Assembly Candidate Association and the Chongqing Branch, Sichuan Branch, Henan, and other National Assembly candidates such as Li Ding et al., requested permission for representative candidates to attend the meeting. After investigation, there is no such provision in the Organization Law of this General Assembly, and the seating in the meeting place is limited. The request should not be discussed.

### Shanghai Garrison Commander May Be Appointed Soon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The military service authorities are taking the selection of the person in charge of military administration in Shanghai very seriously. The second class of military service personnel training has now graduated, and the selection of the Shanghai Garrison Commander can be made in the short term.

### Wu Zhaoxu's Opinion

Chairman Chiang then stood up and invited the chairmen of the first group of the Presidium to the stage. At this point, Wu Zhaoxu, a representative from the Shanxi region in the 1,776-seat gallery, stood up to speak, stating two opinions: "(1) In the letters officially exchanged between Chairman Chiang and Mr. Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party on the 23rd, the point that 'all parties should be responsible for passing the revised draft Constitution of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) within the National Assembly' is a violation of democratic principles. No party can force the National Assembly to accept the Constitution that it intends. (2) There are few democratic elements in the draft rules of procedure, especially in the chapter on 'Motions,' which restricts our freedom to express our opinions and affects the formulation of the Five-Power Constitution and the Three Principles of the People charter that the whole country expects. Please pay attention to this important procedural law to avoid being deprived of the opportunity to speak." After Wu finished speaking, Chairman Chiang said: "The exchange of letters between myself and Mr. Zhang is another matter and will be explained later. Now, according to the agenda, the draft rules of procedure will be read once before we begin the discussion." After the reporter finished reading the draft, Secretary-General Hong further explained the draft: "(1) The procedural law is based on the parent law and specifies the concrete points for applying the parent law. The National Assembly Organization Law has already stipulated this, so this draft will not be relisted or changed. (2) The draft rules list the key points to avoid being cumbersome. (3) The draft rules are based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's 'Preliminary Steps to Democracy' and refer to the rules of procedure of various countries. (4) The restrictions on applying for speaking are because the meeting place is large, there are many representatives, and to avoid confusion and ensure equal opportunities to speak, the regulations are clearly listed." He then clarified the key points and intentions of each chapter. At this point, it was 11:10 AM, and requests to speak were flying to the podium like snowflakes. Chairman Chiang announced a recess.

### Chairman Chiang's Reply

The meeting continued at 11:30 AM. First, Chairman Chiang replied to Representative Wu Zhaoxu's opinion, saying: "The exchange of letters between myself and Mr. Zhang is a matter outside the meeting and has nothing to do with the affairs of the General Assembly. When the PCC closed, I stated that the establishment of the revised Constitution could bind party members, but I had no right to interfere with the National Assembly." (Applause) This exchange of letters was made by me in the name of the Kuomintang Director-General and was limited to the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party. It has no binding force on the General Assembly. As for the point that there are too few democratic elements in the rules of procedure, everyone can discuss and amend them as much as possible. However, democracy must be established under the law. The Founding Father also showed us this. I hope that all representatives will enthusiastically express their opinions within the legal scope for everything submitted for discussion to achieve perfection." (Loud applause) Then, Sun Jianmin, a representative from the Henan region, spoke, requesting that "the drafting of the Constitution should not be done behind closed doors. We must listen to the reports of public opinion from representatives from all regions and the policy reports from various government departments. However, we must not be emotional or stubborn. We must be enthusiastic, conscientious, and work for the country and the people to formulate a century-long law." At this point, Chairman Chiang announced, "Now we will only discuss the method of discussing the draft rules of procedure. Please speak on this topic and do not go off-topic." Opinions were divided, and a heated debate unfolded. Finally, it was put to a vote. Kong Geng, a representative from the Hubei region, said that the opinion of "submitting it for review before further discussion" passed with 731 votes. Chairman Chiang said, "The method of review will be decided by the Presidium and reported in the afternoon." Secretary-General Hong then stood up and reported, asking all Presidium representatives to gather in the meeting room to hold a meeting. The General Assembly will continue at 3:00 PM. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.

### Soviet Military Authorities in North Korea Send Representatives to Visit Andong - Visit Regarding the CCP Issue Does Not Affect Relations Between the Two Countries

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 25th] After the Yalu River Railway Bridge, which connects Andong with transportation in Korea, was blockaded by both sides, there has been no international traffic. On the 23rd, the Supreme Command of the Soviet occupation forces in northern Korea dispatched representatives across the river to Andong to meet Commander Zhao Gongwu for an informal reception and discussed various local issues. Zhao readily agreed to provide assistance where possible, and the Soviet envoys returned satisfied. Zhao also plans to send Lei Kewen, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, as a representative to northern Korea for a formal visit soon. The Soviet authorities stated that the CCP issue is an internal affair of China and will not affect Sino-Soviet relations in any way due to the CCP.

### Wang Chonghui Discusses the New Constitution - Based on Principles Formulated by the PCC - The Chapter on the Administrative System Is the Most Important

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Wang Chonghui, the compiler of the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China, told our reporter on the 25th that the more the constitution of a country is accepted by the majority of the people, the better. At the very least, it must be satisfactory to the majority of the people. In a democratic system, everyone can express their opinions, especially when discussing the Constitution. Good opinions can be put forward as much as possible. However, I hope that the discussion will have results. After a majority decision is made, I hope that all parties can comply with it. This draft amendment to the Constitution is based on the principles formulated by the PCC and is a comprehensive product, which is different from the Five-Five Draft Constitution based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. However, one point must be pointed out, that the constitutions of most countries are mostly formulated by compromising the opinions of all parties. It is not easy to seek a constitution that can be implemented by one ideology. When the United States drafted its constitution, there were fierce disputes, and its constitution was formulated by compromising the opinions of all parties. The formulation of the new French constitution is not based solely on the claims of one party. Wang said that the most noteworthy issue in the new draft constitution is the responsibility of the administration to the legislature, saying: The new system is a new system between the presidential system and the cabinet system, because the cabinet system frequently collapses, which seems unsuitable for China, which needs stability. However, if the presidential system is implemented, there are concerns that the ruling party may act arbitrarily. The new system was proposed by compromising the two. This chapter is important, because whether and how politics can be promoted is related to it. There is also a new proposal for the chapter on local and central governments. This chapter is drafted based on the principle of balanced power. After the powers of the central and local governments are clearly defined, disputes will only arise when there is ambiguity between the two. However, this situation is not common after all.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The submission of the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China to the National Assembly may have to wait until the rules of procedure are passed by the National Assembly.

### Zhang Junmai Engages in Writing

Several representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party arrive in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper] After Mr. Zhang Junmai came to Shanghai, he lived in seclusion and received only one guest, Mr. Chen Guangfu, who had just returned from Jiujiang. The Fan Yuan residence has also been heavily guarded, with the shutters down, which reminds people of the busy visits a month ago. Zhang has decided to engage in writing, and the date of his departure to Peiping has not been determined.

Sun Baoyi, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, said yesterday that since the Democratic League had clearly announced at a press conference in Nanjing on the 24th that the Democratic Socialist Party was considering withdrawing from the League, the Democratic Socialist Party would have to consider withdrawing from the League. Mr. Junmai told him that it would be best if democracy and peace could be achieved simultaneously. If peace cannot be achieved for a while, but democracy can still move forward one step, the Democratic Socialist Party is still unwilling to give up the opportunity to promote democracy. The Democratic Socialist Party has its own position, so it decided to participate in the National Assembly with conditions. Regarding the draft amendment to the Constitution, Sun said that opinions vary from all walks of life, and criticism is inevitable. Ta Kung Pao ridiculed the chapter on basic national policy as a slogan. However, it is not known that this chapter is actually based on the opinions of Mr. Zhou Enlai. At that time, it was dictated by Zhou and recorded word by word by someone. As for the first article of the first chapter, which states: "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people," some people criticized the phrase "owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people" as superfluous. In fact, it is also based on the agreement of that year and was not invented by the drafters. When asked by reporters how the Democratic Socialist Party would be positioned when the Democratic League would be holding a meeting in Shanghai in the next few days and Zhang Lan would come to Shanghai to preside over it, Sun replied: It is difficult to say at present whether the Democratic Socialist Party will receive an invitation to the meeting. When the Youth Party left the Democratic League in the past, the Democratic League formally did not invite them to the meeting. Sun also said that the Democratic Socialist Party would not issue any statement replying to the Democratic League.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Wu Xianzi and Hong Shaozhi, representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party to the National Assembly, arrived in Nanjing from Hong Kong at 5:00 PM on the 25th. After disembarking, they visited Jiang Yuntian and Xu Chuanlin, etc. It is reported that Wu et al. plan to decide on the date of registration after meeting with Zhang Junmai, and it is also heard that Zhang Junmai will return to Nanjing from Shanghai in the next few days. In addition, Luo Jingxuan, a female representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on the 25th and went to Shanghai for business. She will come to Nanjing for registration in the next few days. In addition, several representatives of the party in Peiping are scheduled to come to Nanjing from Peiping on the 25th.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] Shi Zhiquan, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, will fly to Nanjing with Ji Yiqiao on a China Aviation flight on the morning of the 26th. Another representative, Wang Zhihai, is waiting for a flight in Peiping and is expected to travel in a day or two.

### Internal Rift in the Democratic Socialist Party

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] Due to the issue of participating in the National Assembly, the internal rift in the Democratic Socialist Party is becoming increasingly apparent. Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui, important members of the Democratic Socialist Party in Peiping, issued a letter to Zhang Junmai today, stating their opposition to participating in the National Assembly. If the headquarters cannot reverse this move, the three of them will withdraw from the Democratic Socialist Party. Hu Haimen also had a private letter stating that he was instructed to return to Peiping to explain the participation in the National Assembly to his colleagues, but his colleagues here still cannot understand it. He hoped that his brother would come to Peiping in person, otherwise the party would be split. Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui exchanged opinions at Hu's residence yesterday and finally made this decision.

### Spokesman for the Democratic League Claims that the Door to Peace Talks Is Not Closed

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 24th] Luo Longji, a spokesman for the Democratic League, said: I will appeal to the government on the 25th not to order the National Army to attack Yan'an so that the door to resuming peace talks will remain open.

### Datong in Northern Shanxi Is Again in Emergency - The Lu Communist Army Fails to Attack the Outskirts of Jinan - Wangdu in the Northern Section of Pinghan Is Recaptured

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] Under the active activities of the Communist Army in Shanxi, Datong is again in danger. The Communist Army is attacking the outlying strongholds of Datong. Rencun in the south has fallen again. Jilugang in the west has also fallen again after days of fierce attacks by the Communist Army. Kouquanxiaoling is still under fierce attack.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 25th] At 10:00 PM on the 24th, a unit of the Communist Army's Police 1st Brigade and more than 5,000 militiamen from Licheng County launched a fierce attack on the Ninth Slave Mountain and Black Peak Pass defense line of the National Army 20 kilometers south of Jinan City. After a night of fierce fighting, the Communist Army suffered heavy casualties. At dawn on the 25th, the Communist Army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. Another unit of more than 3,000 of its backbone regiment has arrived at Heishan to the southwest of Mingshui on the 25th to harass Mingshui. According to reports, the Police 1st Brigade was previously moved from Taian. This attack on the outskirts of Jinan City is the fifth offensive by the Communist Army in Shandong after the ceasefire order.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 25th] The Communist Army has decided to launch a major war in southeastern Shandong Province. Because the National Army holds the Jiaoji Railway, the Communist Army has no corridor to Jiaodong, so it is the focus of the Communist Army's desperate fight. Recently, senior generals of the Communist Army held a secret meeting and decided to use the Muling Pass at the border of Yishui and Linqu, the Tongling Pass at the border of Linqu and Boshan, the Jinyang Pass at the border of Xintai and Laiwu, and the Tianmen Pass at the border of Zhangqiu and Taian as its last base in Shandong. Once the deployment is completed, it will begin to attack the National Army. It is expected that everything east of the Jinpu Road and south of the Jiaoji Road will be spared from becoming war zones in the future. More than 40,000 people from the Communist Army's New Fourth Army moved from Zhucheng to Ducun, 10 kilometers southwest of Jiaoxian, on the 22nd. There have been no changes north of the Jiaoji Road recently.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 25th] More than 15,000 people from the Communist Army's New Fourth Army's Third Column have been collecting more than 200 boats in the area 40 li north of Suqian in recent days, attempting to cross the Grand Canal and attack the west. More than 10,000 Communist troops in southern Shandong have been wandering around Zouwudongxiji and other places more than 30 li east of Lincheng in recent days, destroying many sections of the tracks, bridges, and power lines of the Linzao branch line. They have now retreated.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] The Communist Army in the northern section of Pinghan has become more active. Wangdu County has again fallen into the hands of the Communist Army. The situation in Yi County is still at a stalemate. Zhou Fucheng, commander of the 53rd Army, came to Peiping from the Northeast. After visiting Sun Lianzhong yesterday, he went to the command post in Baoding to command his troops. The defense of the area will be the responsibility of the 53rd Army. The 94th Army is still in the Zhuoxian area.

### National Assembly Anecdotes

— Our Reporter Pu Dejie

First Session of the National Assembly: Scattered Notes

At the first session of the National Assembly on the 25th, Chairman Chiang personally presided. He was wearing a khaki military uniform and sat in the center of the rostrum on a high-backed chair. The gold stars on his collar tabs, the gold badges of the National Assembly representatives, and the gold lettering on the vermilion sashes of the presidium shimmered under the bright mercury lights. Several tense moments during the proceedings were smoothly overcome thanks to Chairman Chiang's composure and decisiveness, and the agile handling of Secretary-General Hong, who was seated to his left. The entire session was imbued with democratic elements, seeking common ground amidst differences. When Chairman Chiang invited the members of the first group of the presidium to ascend the rostrum, Secretary-General Hong repeatedly announced that the first group to go up were those seated downstairs, the first to go up was Hu Shih in a blue robe, black jacket, and gold-rimmed glasses. The second group were those seated upstairs, with the corpulent Kong Xiangxi in a gray suit leading the way. Gu Zhenggang and Huang Guoshu deferred to each other behind him. The last to go up was Ahamadjan, a young and capable man wearing a velvet cap and a dark cyan Mao-style suit. Ding Weifen resigned and did not go up.

Wang Liwen, Fei Xia, and Bao Deming, three female representatives, sat together chatting idly. Wang said to Fei, "It's better to speak less," and Bao said, "It's not easy to get a chance to speak."

Wu He (Wu Xu), who was known in the Political Council for being bold and eloquent, was the first to express opinions and fired two cannons: one questioning Chairman Chiang, and the other reminding the assembly. Chairman Chiang, after sitting there twirling his beard, stood up and explained amicably, which won him a lot of applause.

One representative, wearing a neat naval uniform, ran into Chen Cheng during the break and gave a respectful forty-five-degree bow. Chen Cheng returned the greeting and smiled.

During the break: Sun Ke and Wang Yunhui sat in the lounge drinking tea and speaking Cantonese fluently. A reporter next to them asked his colleague, "Has President Sun arrived?"

Bai Chongxi is always the target of reporters' competition. During the break, he was again surrounded by newspaper reporters from out of town who were asking for inscriptions and autographs. "Please write down the newspaper's name!" "Please advise our newspaper!"

Regarding the method of discussing the revision of the rules of procedure, everyone spoke one after another. Kong Geng, with his silver beard, stepped onto the podium for the first time. The chairman asked him to submit his "request to speak" and wait his turn. After the break, it was his turn to speak. He advocated that each unit should nominate one or two representatives to meet first, review and summarize opinions, and then the assembly would discuss them. "This is the experience I have gained in the Political Council for seven years. Otherwise, one person speaks east and another speaks west, and the meeting will be thrown into chaos. At the same time, it is too disrespectful to Chairman Chiang, the head of state."

Duan Jianmin from Tongshan Irrigation, when he got the opportunity to speak, generously stated his views. The time was up, but Secretary-General Hong forgot to ring the bell. Chairman Chiang looked at his watch and gave a reminder, and then the bell rang...

When voting on the method of discussion, there were a total of three opinions. 698 people supported discussing it chapter by chapter, which was half a vote short of half of the number of attendees "1397". Kong Xiangxi added one vote, which passed half. However, the assembly still requested that the other two opinions be voted on. As a result, 146 people supported general discussion, and the lights on the voting machine were sparse. 731 people supported submitting it for review first, and the voting machine was densely filled with stars. Mr. Kong finally won.

The National Assembly continued its session in the afternoon. After Representative Hu Shih, as the chairman, reported on the decision suggested at the midday meeting, the opinions were divided and it became impossible to proceed. Chairman Chiang stood up and said, "Slow down, let me explain first, please wait a moment before speaking." After he explained reasonably and empathetically, the situation calmed down.

After the first three chapters of the draft rules of procedure were successfully passed, the fourth chapter began with a special feel. Representative Chen Tongzhou from Fujian stood up, "Chairman, number 465 requests to speak." "Wait a moment." "This is the review meeting, and I want to speak between the third and fourth chapters of the draft, please allow me to speak." "It's not that you're not allowed to speak, please wait until the original text of the draft is read out before speaking." The chairman's amiability and composure made him sit down again.

Regarding the fourth chapter, the number of speakers was innumerable. Secretary-General Hong reported twice, "There are too many requests to speak. Those who can have their remarks read out, please do not speak. If there are any additions, please come in order." Later, everyone became tired, and fewer people spoke. Only Secretary-General Hong was heard reading out written opinions in a calm voice with a Yangzhou accent.

Many representatives had particularly loud voices, which caused the loudspeakers to squeak. Secretary-General Hong helplessly explained, "When using the loudspeaker, the distance should be moderate, the height should be adjusted, and the volume should be especially controlled, please pay attention." But not long after, a certain representative shouted loudly again, and the whole audience could not hear what he was saying, making them both cry and laugh. Secretary-General Hong waited for him to shout, and then said humbly, "Please pay attention: the sound is not good, too loud, too high, too loud, too high, unpleasant to listen to!"

During the afternoon break, Representative Luo Shu took a piece of paper and went around looking for people to sign. The reporter ran up and asked, "Mr. Luo must have some brilliant ideas?" He said busily, "No, no, this is a matter for the Political Council; let me tell you a piece of news: the Political Council Friendship Association can be established next week."

Liu Huai, a Shanxi district representative with white hair and eyebrows, spoke on Articles 18 and 19 in a peaceful and orderly tone, using precise and relatable examples. His speech won unanimous praise, and everyone said "This old man makes sense."

The steps to the left of the rostrum were full of reporters, men and women, red and green, thin and fat, sitting and leaning. It was the most complicated and natural corner in the assembly hall.

The meeting adjourned when it got dark. Outside the hall, it was raining heavily, and everyone was crowded at the gate and under the corridor, with a sense of "unable to proceed." A colleague said, "The fatigue bombing has begun, I can't take it!"

### In the Central Memorial Week, Chairman Chiang Encourages National Assembly Representatives to Complete the Great Task of Constitution-Making

### Clarifying the Spirit of the Sino-U.S. Treaty, U.S. Ambassador Issues Special Statement: No Harm to China's Sovereignty

[Our Newspaper] U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, issued an important statement on the misunderstanding caused by the Sino-U.S. Treaty at a press conference held by the U.S. Information Office at Hamilton House at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Chinese newspapers' discussions on the recently established Sino-U.S. Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation reveal that they have many misunderstandings about the nature and scope of the rights and privileges granted to the two countries, and some Chinese newspapers unreasonably point out that the United States has imposed unequal conditions on China. This treaty is definitely not like that. Since the abolition of extraterritoriality in China in 1943, a gap has arisen, and this treaty is used to fill this gap.

Targeting Relevant National Relations

In order to stipulate the conveniences that the people of these two sovereign countries should enjoy in each other's territories, such treaty provisions are necessary; at present, there are many treaties of the same nature between countries, which form a legal organization, and within this organization, countries normally maintain friendly contacts and trade activities. The Sino-U.S. Treaty of 1943 stipulated the conclusion of this treaty, because the abolition of extraterritoriality in China required a basic treaty to replace it, targeting the changed relations between the two countries, and adjusting the daily life that the people of the two countries need to implement in each other's territories. For example, this treaty allows the people of any country to travel and reside in each other's territories, as well as to conduct commercial, educational, religious, and charitable work. This treaty also provides for the leasing and ownership of land for various purposes.

Without such a treaty, the people of the two countries would not have the basis to carry out so many activities with each other. This treaty is of such fundamental importance. This treaty is as important to China and Chinese citizens as it is to the United States and American citizens. Undoubtedly, China must also conclude similar treaties with other countries with which she hopes to conduct mutually beneficial transactions.

Inaccurate Predictions and Justifications

Some Chinese newspapers have misunderstood the terms of the treaty, especially the most-favored-nation clause, which has led to inaccurate predictions that this treaty is the beginning of a series of new unequal treaties, which is incorrect. The fact is that the most-favored-nation clause is included in all modern commercial treaties between countries of equal status.

For example, a country that grants most-favored-nation treatment to the other party is not obliged to set special tax rules for tariffs or navigation rights, nor is it obliged to allow foreign ships to enter inland and coastal waterways without restriction. Under the Sino-U.S. Treaty, China does not lose its tariff autonomy or its right to control shipping and foreign trade. The foreign trade regulations recently promulgated by the Chinese government are the most sufficient proof of this fact.

The United States does not expect China to sacrifice its sovereignty or compromise, and there is absolutely no such provision in the treaty, but the treaty specifically stipulates that Americans in China and Chinese in the United States must not be treated with discrimination, and they all enjoy reasonable and necessary rights and conveniences in each other's countries.

The United States does not want, nor has it obtained, special rights in China.

### Mayor Wu and Others Host Ambassador Stuart for Dinner

[Our Newspaper] At 7:00 p.m. last night, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and others from the Weekend Forum hosted a dinner for Ambassador Stuart at the World Society site on Linsen Road. Guests included Speaker Pan Gongzhan, U.S. Consul General Davis and his wife, etc. At around 8:00 p.m., Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for Ambassador Stuart at his official residence. In addition to the ambassador, those invited also included Consul General Davis and his wife and several friends of the ambassador in Shanghai. The atmosphere was very cheerful. Today at 5:00 p.m., the Yanjing University Alumni Association held a tea party at the Customs Club (Tongyi Lane, Chengdu Road, Jing'an Temple Road) to entertain the ambassador. The ambassador is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow morning with his spokesman, Connors, and political advisor Fu Jingbo on a special plane to return to Beijing. According to the talks, Brazil-China relations are good.

### Cheng Tianguo Heads to Beijing

According to the talks, Brazil-China relations are good.

[This City News] Ambassador to Brazil Cheng Tianguo returned to China on the 22nd and arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, he took the night express train to Beijing to pay respects to the central authorities and report on the situation in Brazil. Before leaving Shanghai, reporters interviewed the ambassador at his hotel. According to the talks: Brazil has a vast territory and abundant resources, which is similar to our country. It has been actively engaged in construction after the war, and its achievements are quite impressive. In the past, under the dictatorial political system, there was no lack of disturbances in domestic politics. However, after the promulgation of the constitution this year and the organization of a mixed government of various parties by the new president, politics has gradually become on track, and it is rapidly becoming a model country for advocating democratic politics in Latin America. There are a total of 20 Latin American nations in South America, which have always been dominated by pro-Americanism. Their foreign policy is led by Brazil. The countries are united with each other due to their common race and culture, and their position in the United Nations organization is very important. Our country's diplomacy should pay special attention to South America in the future. He also said: Brazil's relations with our country are very good. This is because Brazil specifically gifted Chairman Chiang a first-class Grand Cordon medal, which is enough to express its respect for our country's leader; also, since the signing of the China-Brazil Cultural Agreement this year, overseas Chinese in Brazil have gained the protection of equal treatment.

### Special Envoy Marshall Arrives in Beiping; Does Not Speculate on the Prospects of Peace Talks; "Not Sure" Whether He Will Go to Yan'an

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Beiping at 2:10 p.m. on the 25th on a large blue plane, flying amidst cloudy skies. Mrs. Marshall, General Gillem and his wife, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, He Siyuan, Cai Wenzhi, Ye Jianying's representative Xue Yuyan, and more than 30 reporters all went to Nanyuan Airport to welcome him. After Marshall got off the plane and exchanged greetings with the welcomers one by one, he kissed his wife, who had come to greet him in a car and was seated due to illness. Then he was surrounded by reporters. When reporters asked Marshall if he would go to Yan'an, he replied, "Not sure." He also declined to explain his length of stay in Beiping. Then he drove to the residence of the chairman at Yu'en Temple to rest. Gillem, Sun Lianzhong, and Chen Jicheng also accompanied him. Sun, Chen, and Gillem left successively at 3:20 p.m. It is said that Mr. and Mrs. Marshall will have a Chinese dinner at the residence, which has been prepared in advance by the Ninth Reception Office of the Lizhi Society. According to news from the Foreign Affairs Office of the Headquarters, Marshall will stay in Beiping on the 26th and will visit the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills and other places.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 25th] Marshal Marshall came, and after a brief stay in Tianjin, he flew to Beiping at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th. Marshal Marshall seemed very happy on this trip. He once said that when he revisited the streets where he had lived 20 years ago, the old scenery was still vivid, and he felt very happy. Marshal Marshall said at a tea party that his efforts over the years had failed, and he did not speculate on the prospects of peace talks, nor did he say a word about politics. He hoped that the people of the country would recognize reality and guide the country on the road to prosperity. It is reported that he once mentioned "propaganda" and said that the United States attaches great importance to propaganda.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] According to reports, Special Envoy Marshall will return to Beijing from Beiping, and may go to Yan'an from Beijing to meet with Mao Zedong and make a final effort to negotiate between the government and the Chinese Communist Party. Regarding the rumors that Mao will go to Jiamusi and the CCP headquarters will also move, the CCP spokesperson said that this is impossible, because the CCP itself does not have airplanes, and the move of Yan'an will cause a loss of political center.

### Director of the Information Department Explains the Truth About Sino-French Negotiations: We Will Set Up Customs in Haiphong

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Sino-French negotiations have been formally underway for more than two weeks, and people from all walks of life attach great importance to their progress. In order to understand the truth, the reporter specially visited He Fengshan, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Director of the Information Department, and inquired about some questions. The answers were quite detailed. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Q: What treaty is the Sino-French negotiation based on?

A: It is based on the Sino-French agreement on Sino-Vietnamese relations signed on February 28 this year.

Q: What is the scope and content of this negotiation?

A: In order to implement the agreement, there are many technical issues that need to be agreed upon by both parties. The main ones are that China will recover the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the principles and standards for its valuation should be discussed with the French company that originally operated the railway; secondly, if customs are set up in Haiphong, the required capacity of the docks, warehouses, and sheds must have a defined scope, and attention must be paid to the actual situation of Sino-Vietnamese trade to achieve the purpose of Sino-Vietnamese transportation. China will set up customs in Haiphong in the future only for the management of Chinese import and export goods passing through Vietnam. There is a misunderstanding that Haiphong will be designated as a free port.

Q: Why didn't the Vietnamese government participate in this negotiation?

A: This negotiation is purely a technical issue issued in accordance with the Sino-French agreement, so as to provide China with various convenient methods of transportation. It does not involve the internal affairs of the Vietnamese mainframe territory, and the Vietnamese side did not participate in this negotiation. It is an internal issue between France and Vietnam, and China is not in a position to make any claims.

Q: After China recovers the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, how will the railway be operated?

A: After China recovers the Yunnan section, its sovereignty belongs to our country. We should first try to repair the damaged sections and cooperate with the Vietnamese section on joint transportation so that Yunnan's export trade can be restored.

Q: The losses of our country's officials and businesses are compensated by the French side with the valuation of the Yunnan section. If the price of the road is not enough to compensate our country for the losses, will the Japanese assets in northern Vietnam be used as compensation?

A: Yes. As for how the compensation for the losses of officials and businesses will be distributed in the future, it is an internal matter for our country and will be handled separately by the relevant agencies.

### Chen Zhiping Will Return to the Philippines Within Days; New Sino-Philippine Treaty Will Be Signed; Differences Have Been Approached by Both Sides

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The new Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship will be signed in the near future. Minister to the Philippines Chen Zhiping told reporters on the 25th that the differences of opinion between the two sides in the new Sino-Philippine Treaty have been approached, and it is expected that an agreement can be reached after he returns to the Philippines within the week. According to this new agreement, overseas Chinese in the Philippines will enjoy most-favored-nation treatment. He continued that after the new treaty is signed, the second step will be to contact for a commercial treaty, and he believes that communication and negotiation with the Philippines will be more convenient in the future. He can assert that the friendship between China and the Philippines will definitely increase day by day. The Philippine President has also repeatedly assured that the friendship between China and the Philippines will be strengthened day by day. When explaining the Filipinization Act, Chen said: The Filipinization Act rumored by foreign countries refers to the recent Labor Nationalization Act signed by the President. The act stipulates that 60% of the employees of any enterprise must be Filipinos. Overseas Chinese are subject to considerable influence. For other cases such as the priority of Filipinos for market stalls and the Filipinization of retail sales that are brewing, which are very unfavorable to overseas Chinese businessmen, the government has taken into account the preparations to take appropriate measures. Chen is scheduled to return to the Philippines within days.

### Jiaoji Railway Will Be Fully Open Soon; Qingdao-Gaomi Section Opened to Traffic Yesterday; Ping-Sui Railway's Ping-Zhang Section Has Been Repaired

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 25th] The Qingdao-Gaomi section of the Jiaoji Railway was reopened to traffic on the 25th, carrying more than 1,500 passengers, with domestic goods accounting for one-third. In addition, the Qingdao-Jiaoxian section has been open to traffic for a month without major disruptions.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 25th] Xi Shungeng, director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, returned on the 24th after inspecting the repairs on the Jiaoji Line. According to the talks: The eastern section of Jiaoji has now been repaired to between Kangjiazhuang and Gaomi, and the western section to between Huangqibao and Zuoshan. There are still 50 kilometers that have not been repaired in the middle. It is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic by mid-December. [Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The damaged sections of the Ping-Zhang section of the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway have been repaired and are open to traffic as usual today.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] A railway official stated this morning when discussing the current state of railway transportation in North China that the transportation efficiency is low due to the improper establishment of trunk line institutions, which prevents the various lines from effectively cooperating. The separation of Guannei and Guanwai on the Beining Railway makes it impossible to fully allocate vehicles. He believes that this kind of treatment is a step backward, so there is consideration. In the past, the Japanese adopted the method of setting up a general institution to unify the operation. In addition, Guannei and Guanwai and the northern provinces each govern themselves, only seeking convenience for their own management, and imposing arbitrary controls on various special products, prohibiting them from leaving the country, which also hinders the people's livelihood. Although there is a shortage of train cars now, and the railways are often damaged, the vehicles on many lines often cannot be effectively utilized and return empty due to local restrictions on the export of materials.

Prosecutor Chen Shengzu applied to the High Court for a retrial on the 25th because the sentences were too light. Jiang Jihu, the puppet president of the Examination Yuan, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court, and was not satisfied, so he also applied to the High Court for a retrial.

### Public Trial of Traitors Pan and Luo Delayed Due to Unarrived Documents

### American Businesses Enter the Mainland: Setting up Shops in Wuzhou to Explore Local Products, Establishing Warehouses and Acquiring Steamships in Guangzhou

[Our Guangzhou dispatch from the 25th] Following the signing of the Sino-American commercial treaty, American businesses have actively begun commercial activities in China. It has been learned that an American business group has rented over a dozen shops on Jiufang Road in Wuzhou, Guangxi, specifically to procure local products such as tung oil and star anise oil for direct shipment to the United States. This also serves as a base for promoting American goods. They have also established warehouses in Huangpu, Guangzhou, and acquired two hundred steamships of up to 800 tons each to transport goods between Guangzhou and Wuzhou. This move undoubtedly marks the beginning of American businesses penetrating the mainland for economic activities, and American goods will inevitably flow throughout the country.

Editorial

### Overseas Chinese Affairs Policy Should Be Included in the Constitution

The revised draft of the constitution has completed its procedures in the Legislative Yuan, and the National Assembly is about to begin discussions. We feel that there are too many issues that deserve careful study, and today we will first discuss one of them.

We have read the current amendment from beginning to end, but we cannot find the term "Overseas Chinese Affairs." However, item 24 of Article 26 in Chapter 3 stipulates the method of representatives elected by Overseas Chinese participating in the organization of the National Assembly. As for item 13 of Article 108 in Chapter 10, which concerns immigration and land reclamation, it clearly refers to domestic immigration and land reclamation and is unrelated to Overseas Chinese.

The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and Overseas Chinese are citizens of the motherland. The draft constitution seems to have covered all the rights and obligations of domestic citizens, but it does not mention a word about the twelve million Overseas Chinese who are scattered overseas and living in isolation. This is truly regrettable. We sincerely hope that the National Assembly will not forget them when drafting the constitution this time. At the same time, representatives from overseas and those in charge of Overseas Chinese affairs should not let this good opportunity pass lightly.

If Overseas Chinese affairs policy cannot be established as a separate chapter, it should at least be included in Chapter 13, "Fundamental National Policies," of the draft constitution. Its articles could be roughly worded as follows: "The Overseas Chinese affairs of the Republic of China shall focus on migration, colonization, conservation, and development of Overseas Chinese." Migration is a phenomenon of human movement. The conditions of migration can generally be divided into four types: invasion, conquest, colonization, and immigration. "Invasion" refers to the organized plundering of more civilized areas by culturally inferior but strong and rugged peoples. The Goths and Huns are famous historical examples. This is absolutely unlike the Japanese, who invaded our Chinese culture. "The boar and the serpent are long, recommending food to the upper country," which is the most recent act of invasion. "Conquest" often refers to a culturally more advanced nation using military force to attack a relatively backward nation, making the latter its dependency, thereby increasing its authority, expanding its territory, and seizing economic benefits. The ancient Roman Empire was such an example.

"Colonization" refers to a country sending its people to reside in a new territory, thereby expanding the country's political influence and obtaining economic benefits. The country of the migrants obtains control over the place of migration. This process often utilizes the activities of commercial groups, such as the East India Company, with military force as its backdrop, but not relying on naked military force. The largest colonial movement in history occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries. Countries competed for overseas influence, using colonial actions as weapons to seize overseas territories and resources. Portugal and Spain initiated this, followed by the rise of the Netherlands, England, and France, who later surpassed them. As a result of Japan's emphasis on development, the rural population flowed to the cities and also to the colonies. The increase in commodity production depended on the colonies as markets; the raw materials for production relied on the colonies for supply; and the high degree of development of monopoly capital required the colonies as places to invest surplus capital.

According to Fairchild's definition, "immigration" refers to the migration of a group of individuals or families who move from one country to another voluntarily and on their own responsibility. The motivation for immigration is based on personal interests and peaceful means are used to achieve the desired goals. Overseas Chinese follow this pattern. McNair explains in his book "The Overseas Chinese," "The Overseas Chinese are not colonizers." They do not come as a group, so there is no forceful seizure of land; their migration is for economic reasons rather than political ones. Therefore, they only passively resist and never actively engage, resulting in greater suffering than any other ethnic group.

Our country's immigration began in the Han Dynasty and flourished in the Tang Dynasty. Calling Chinese people "Tang people" and calling the places where Chinese people live "Chinatowns" shows the prosperity of the Overseas Chinese at that time. By the late Ming Dynasty, Western powers invaded the East. After the contact between Chinese and Western forces, foreigners were organized and had ambition, and the great powers divided up Southeast Asia. This fully illustrates that our Overseas Chinese are "immigrants" rather than colonizers, and certainly not invaders or conquerors. They bullied the weak and enslaved the inferior, which is truly contrary to our spirit of benevolence. Our Three Principles of the People hold that culturally advanced nations have the obligation to assist culturally backward nations, but do not advocate conquest by force.

Immigration is not a problem, and the colonization we propose has no political or territorial ambitions, and is actually the same as immigration, except that the word "colonization" is easier to say. The Japanese, Kojima, define the word "colonization" as "nationals of a country permanently or long-term migrating to a colony to engage in economic or military facilities," but our concept is not like this. Because Overseas Chinese have a strong sense of home, "trees are thousands of feet tall, but the leaves fall back to their roots." Even if they are not buried alive, they must return to Zhengshou Qiu after death. There is no thought of permanent migration, and there is no military background. The facts of thousands of years ago can prove this. Our colonization policy does not stimulate foreigners, so there is no need to fear foreigners and not include it in the constitution.

Protecting and educating Overseas Chinese is even more righteous. Which country's Overseas Chinese do not need the protection of their home country? Which country's Overseas Chinese do not need the education of their home country? Considering Overseas Chinese as "bad people" and letting them survive on their own should be put to ashes by the flames of the Anti-Japanese War. Although there is no explicit provision for the protection of Overseas Chinese in international law, customary law and factual needs have long been implemented. Chinese people have suffered from the protection of Overseas Chinese by foreigners. If there are souls, everyone will never forget it so quickly!

In the era of the Roman Empire, the law of personality was used purely. In short, Roman citizens were protected by law, while foreigners did not have this right. In the Middle Ages, people's residences gradually became fixed, and various ethnic groups intermarried with each other, so it gradually became difficult to apply the law of personality, and the law of the place replaced it. After the French Revolution, the theory of human rights prevailed, that is, human beings have the right to lose their assigned rights, and no matter whether they live in their own country or abroad, they cannot be violated, and the theory of protecting overseas Chinese was further established. Since the French Revolution, European countries have spared no effort to protect Overseas Chinese, and they all believe that it is the responsibility of the country, and often sacrifice the lives of other people for the sake of one or two Overseas Chinese who have been infringed upon. Since our country has a large number of people abroad, the responsibility for protection should be mentioned in the constitution.

Overseas Chinese education is the foundation for building a prosperous Overseas Chinese community. Overseas Chinese education is a way to prevent Overseas Chinese from becoming foreigners and always loving their motherland. How can it be ignored? People maliciously prohibit our Overseas Chinese from educating people and have actively developed methods to set up free schools to recruit Overseas Chinese. What is the purpose? We must re-educate the people of Japan and Germany, we must have the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Conference, what is the purpose? And we ourselves seem to ignore the descendants of the Yellow Emperor abroad, whether to manage or not to manage, is it wisdom or stupidity?

The contribution of Overseas Chinese to the motherland is really too great! Since the Revolution, the Anti-Japanese War and the construction of the country, there is no battle that they have not participated in. How can we count the dedication of our lives and wealth? If we do not mention a word about Overseas Chinese affairs policy in the constitution, how can we be worthy of them?

Promoting International Cultural and Educational Cooperation

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is currently meeting in Paris. In addition to the election of Dr. Zhao Yuanren, our country's chief representative, as chairman of the General Assembly, Professor Chen Yuan, our country's representative, has also been elected as a member of the Executive Board of the organization with representatives from 17 other countries. The convening of this conference to promote international cultural cooperation is worthy of the attention of the world. Relations between countries and interactions between nations, although there are relations in various aspects, cultural relations are the most fundamental. As mankind enters the age of atomic energy, the invention of aviation and wireless electricity has shortened the distance of space, making the entire earth a very small unit. The various nations living on this earth should have closer cultural relations to enhance mutual understanding between them. Therefore, at this time, we should do our best to promote international cultural relations. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization convened a conference in Paris at this moment, which can be said to meet an urgent need between countries. After this, how the meeting will be held, the representatives who attend and participate have the promotion of international coordination as their ambition, and it is believed that there will be important resolutions; For the promotion of international cultural and educational cooperation, there will be very important contributions.

What we find regrettable is that such an important international gathering did not have the participation of the Soviet representatives, and even the observers were not sent, which is a little bit unsatisfactory. Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has been devoted to the construction of socialist culture, and the country has spared no effort in promoting academic culture; and it has also established the Foreign Culture Association to seek to strengthen the cultural relations of the Soviet Union with various nations other than the Soviet Union. Professor Hua Luogeng, a famous mathematician in our country, and archaeologist Guo Moruo, who is famous for his research on Yin and Shang characters, and the famous novelist Shen Yanbing (Mao Dun), who is about to visit the Soviet Union recently, are said to have been invited by the Soviet Foreign Culture Association to visit the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is not unconcerned about the promotion of international cultural relations; However, the UNESCO General Assembly did not even send observers, which is inevitably a little disappointing. The New York Times commented on the first General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and said: "It is not difficult for us to understand the reason why the Soviet people are hesitant to move forward; they do not want their people to be thrown into the embrace of what they consider to be unorthodox ideas." We do not want to trace the motives of the Soviet Union's refusal to participate; But I hope that if the Soviet Union does not send representatives to this meeting, there will be representatives from the Soviet Union to add color to this international conference.

The use of the term "culture" also reminds people of memories that are not necessarily pleasant. From the English Cutr to the German Kuetuy, it is a disturbing memory. This Fan changed the meaning of culture. The aggressiveness of the German warlords is deeply connected with this word. In their eyes, the German army has a sacred mission to spread culture. From the Middle Ages to Hitler, this idea was deeply imprinted in the hearts of every German invader. Our neighbor, Japan, was unfortunately poisoned by this Germanic thought. Now that Hitler's party has been defeated, the era of "culture" as a weapon of warlord aggression is over. However, today, although the Prussian and Japanese warlords have been overthrown, we still see how many of the same situations are disguised under a moving coat. The true value of culture lies not in being used as a weapon, a tool, but in its natural development. It exists and develops beyond politics. If it is used as a tool, whether it falls into the hands of warlords like Prussia or Japan, the result will be the same. Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and other places all had brilliant cultures in the past; But now in the abyss of pain. The fall of Poland could not stop the production of great Polish national literature and the creation of immortal musical masterpieces. All of this is a lesson we have learned from human history.

International cultural and educational cooperation can have many aspects of activity, but the most basic is the communication of ideas. We talk about tariff barriers, but what is most frightening is ideological barriers. Political disputes, and its origin, is still an ideological issue. In socialist countries, all thoughts are dominated by a kind of formulaic agenda. "Words and deeds cannot escape the cage of this ideological formalism." In non-socialist countries, their ideological systems also have their own origins. Looking around the world today, we see socialist cultural fields, the so-called "Western" cultural fields, the Islamic cultural fields, and the Chinese cultural fields; Although there are not no exchanges between each other, the barriers between them are still as strict as ever. How to eliminate the barriers between each other and create a world culture in the whole world should be the goal of all nations to strive for in the future.

As far as we Chinese are concerned, our efforts in this regard are particularly heavy. We have always called ourselves an ancient country of culture, and the whole picture of our cultural heritage is still not known to the world. Standing on the position of the Chinese people at the present stage, today we talk about international cultural cooperation, there are two aspects of input and output: we must have a full understanding of the cultural life of other nations; We must enable other nations to have a full understanding of the cultural life of our own nation. We must enable other nations to have a full understanding and even acceptance of this expensive national cultural heritage. The development of human culture originally had the effect of mutual influence; The most brilliant period in human cultural history was also the time when this mutual influence was most obvious. In our national history, the Tang, Song and even the late Ming and early Qing dynasties need not be said, but the situation is also the same in other parts of the world. Therefore, today, we should absorb the essence of foreign cultures on the one hand, and introduce the essence of our own culture to foreign countries in a planned and organized manner on the other hand, in order to achieve the practical effect of cultural exchange. At present, the Soviet Union has an organization of foreign cultural associations, and the United Kingdom also has a British Cultural Committee. Even in the United States, there is a special office for international cultural cooperation under the State Department, which shows how much countries attach importance to promoting international cultural cooperation. Our mission in international cultural cooperation is particularly important, and it also seems that something must be structured to handle it.

Overseas Chinese Area on the Haiphong Border Bombed by French Naval and Land Forces

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 25th] French artillery and fleets today bombarded the border area of the Overseas Chinese area in Haiphong, where a number of houses were occupied by Viet Minh Republic forces. However, the French army retreated after destroying the airfield and oil depot. French officials said that Viet Minh forces had forcibly occupied a number of houses in the Overseas Chinese area, and other Viet Minh forces were concentrated south and east of Haiphong. The French army had demanded that the Viet Minh forces withdraw from the French and Overseas Chinese areas in Haiphong to avoid new conflicts. This request was rejected. Fighting broke out again this morning, and the Viet Minh forces built new obstacles. Their armed forces entered the Overseas Chinese area, and landmines were placed near French military outposts. French armored vehicles were attacked near obstacles during patrols. In retaliation, the French army shelled the border area of the Overseas Chinese area, and French warships also opened fire. As of the time of transmission, it is not known whether the war has stopped.

### Xin Yutang, Magistrate of Pi County, Resells Large Quantities of Received Supplies: Tongshan District Procuratorate Concludes Investigation and Files Public Prosecution

[Our Xuzhou dispatch] The case of corruption by Xin Yutang, the magistrate of Pi County, has been concluded by the Tongshan District Court Procuratorate, which believes that a public prosecution should be filed. The defendant's criminal facts, evidence, and applicable laws are recorded as follows: The defendant Xin Yutang, the magistrate of Pi County, and Tang Mingyuan, Wen Huaiyun, Li Ruiwu, etc., failed to establish a Pi County Receiving Enemy and Puppet Food Management Committee in accordance with legal procedures when Japan surrendered last year. The defendant, Xin Yutang, appointed Tang Mingyuan as the director of the committee and established an office in Pao Che Town. When a Japanese officer (name unknown) and interpreter Zhao Yizhao escorted a military train through Pao Che Station, Tang Mingyuan received the goods. The enemy train was loaded with 50,000 sets of Japanese officers' and soldiers' uniforms, 10,000 boxes of 7.9 and 6.5 type rifle ammunition (totaling 10 million rounds), 8 military vehicles, 30,000 bags of wheat flour, leather belts, leather cartridge boxes, leather rings, canned food, and 6.5 rifles and mortar shells. In addition, the enemy's abandoned supplies were received in Pao Che Town, including 500,000 packages of millet, 70,000 packages of sesame seeds, 100,000 packages of white rice, 80,000 packages of castor beans, 90,000 packages of corn, 250,000 packages of peas, 330,000 packages of red sorghum, 150,000 packages of dried sweet potatoes, 280,000 pieces of soybean cake, 100,000 catties of white and red sugar, 5,000 bolts of white, blue, and colored miscellaneous cloth, and 230,000 packages of tobacco. In addition, a large-scale warehouse was built near Yunhe Town, and Li Ruiwu, his confidant, was appointed as the director of the Yunhe Town branch. It received 1.5 million packages of enemy wheat, 300,000 packages of dried sweet potatoes, 170,000 packages of corn, 160,000 packages of white rice, 130,000 packages of sesame seeds, 340,000 packages of soybeans, 130,000 packages of castor beans, 350,000 packages of peas, 460,000 packages of red sorghum, 490,000 pieces of soybean cake, 300,000 packages of tobacco leaves, and enemy coal, higher than the mountains. Wen Huaiyou, a staff member of the county government, was the receiving committee member and was responsible for handling it. In addition to daily retail sales, merchants sold it to other places (such as Huai, Si, and Gao counties) for resale. Thousands of vehicles were used every day, and it took more than a month to sell out. In addition, the exact number of supplies in Bayi Ji, Nianzhuang, Zhaodun, Caoqiao and other places is difficult to know in detail due to the rapid sale. However, the number of supplies abandoned by the enemy in Pao Che Town and Yunhe Town and other places is known in more detail because the accuser was the intelligence director of the Ninth Column of the Fifth Sub-district of the Ludong Military Region at that time. However, it is obvious that the defendants sold the received enemy and puppet supplies at low prices, and large grain merchants scrambled to buy them. After Feng Zhiqin filed a request for investigation, the investigation has now been concluded. In accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 1, Section 2, of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, Article 28 of the Criminal Law, and Article 3, Paragraph 2, of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, the crimes are based on Article 1 of the Regulations on Special Criminal Cases, Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and a public prosecution is filed.

### Former Head of Criminal Investigation Team in Wuhu Extorts Large Sums of Money from Merchants, Caught After Using His Power and Acting Rampantly

[Our Wuhu dispatch]程祥麟, the former head of the criminal investigation team of the Wuhu Police Department, who had just been dismissed three months ago, was suddenly arrested and sent to the court by the police department on the evening of the 22nd, which has attracted much attention from the community. 程 is from Hefei. He took office at the beginning of the takeover. 程 claimed to have worked as a secret agent during the war, and still had a lot of potential after his dismissal. Therefore, Tang Shengxuan, the current police chief, was very cautious when he was ordered to arrest him. He first notified the local court and sent six armed bailiffs, who were ambushed near Tang's private residence. He also prepared a grand banquet to entertain 程祥麟, so that he could be captured safely. The bailiffs immediately escorted him to the court in a rickshaw, with strict precautions along the way, and he was sent to the court for detention. In addition to being summoned to Beijing this morning to make a statement, Director Tang also announced the arrest process. He received a telegram from the Ministry of the Interior, which was forwarded to the acting President of the National Government, Chiang. It was reported that Cheng Xianglin, the head of the criminal investigation team of the Wuhu Police Department, had extorted a total of 50 million yuan from Ding Zhi San, the director of the Jiufeng Rice Mill in the county, 100 million yuan from Lou Jingui, the owner of the Yifeng Rice Shop, and 40 million yuan from Hu Shouqing, the president of the Barge Association. Sun Kekuan, a consultant to the Ministry of the Interior, also reinvestigated and found that Cheng Xianglin had indeed extorted and embezzled money. He was ordered to be responsible for arresting and sending him to the court for investigation. In addition, 23 Japanese war criminals, including Tanaka Taro, were escorted to Wuhu on the 22nd from Anqing. They were captured from Jiangxi and other places and will be transferred to Beijing for interrogation within a few days.

### Murder of Husband in Zhujia Lane, Wuxi

[Our Wuxi dispatch] Gu Xieyuan, a resident of Zhujia Lane in Beixiang, 36 years old, married into the Zhang Jigen family in Wangjia Lane nearby in 1919 through an introduction. He married Jigen's daughter, Guidi. At first, the two had a very good relationship, and they had a son and a daughter. However, Gu was addicted to gambling, so the relationship between the husband and wife deteriorated day by day. Guidi was also not used to loneliness, and had an affair with Zhang Jinbao, a fellow villager. The two were very passionate, but they regarded Xieyuan as a thorn in their side. At about 3 a.m. on the 22nd, Jinbao sneaked into Gu's house in order to strike first, and used brute force to press Xieyuan, causing him to suffocate to death. By the time the neighbors discovered it and knocked on the door to enter, it was too late, and the murderer Zhang Jinbao had already fled in fear of punishment. On the morning of the 21st, Gu Yunxiong, the township head of the township, and Cheng Yizhou, the head of the township, escorted the corpse's wife, Zhang Guidi, and the suspect, Gu Shundi, to the procuratorate of the local court to report the case and request an autopsy. Prosecutor Chu opened the interrogation and ordered Zhang Guidi and Gu Shundi to be detained. At 8 a.m. on the 24th, Prosecutor Chu, together with the coroner, went to the countryside to conduct an autopsy, confirming that he had been murdered.

### Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu: Indiscriminately Arresting Families of Refugees

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] It is reported that the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu have established five concentration camps for refugee families in Yancheng, where they have concentrated 21,000 arrested refugee family members from the six counties of Suqian, Siyang, Huai'an, Sihong, Haizhou, and Shuyang, and are subjecting them to communist indoctrination.

### Murder in Jiangbei, Arrest in Jiangnan: Bitter Enemies Exposed a Fake Refugee on a Narrow Road; Three Communist Soldiers Arrested and Sent to Wuxi County Government

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Laowei area of the fifth district of Xinghua, northern Jiangsu, was renamed Jincheng Township after the Communist troops moved in, and Communist instructors Xu Guixing and Xu Xueli, and assassination team leader Xu Guofu, arbitrarily harassed and massacred wealthy households, intellectuals, and senior Central Government personnel there, implementing the so-called land reform policy, forcibly dividing landlords' land. If good citizens slightly resisted, they were labeled as reactionaries and brutally killed. Xu Guomin, a resident of the township, 28 years old, had more than 40 mu of self-cultivated land in his family, all of which was divided up, leaving only six mu for living expenses. Every night, Xu Guomin was forced to patrol and deliver messages. Xu did not dare to resist under their tyranny. However, the Communist troops feared that Xu was suffering grievances and wanted to contact the Nationalist army, so on the morning of the 20th day of the ninth lunar month, Zhang Maolin, Xu Guixing, Xu Guofan, Xu Guofu, Sun Fushi, and others swarmed to Xu's house, tied up Xu Guomin, and took him away. In Sujiazhuang, about two li away from his home, he was hacked to death with broadswords and axes. Xu's wife, Cao, went to search for him and found six corpses at the site, blood and flesh blurred, a tragic sight. The Communist troops prohibited publicizing the matter and hastily collected the bodies. Later, Xu Cao could not bear the oppression of the Communist troops, so she and her brother-in-law, Xu Guoshu, disguised themselves as beggars and fled to Wuxi, living in the home of a relative in Xibing Town in the city. Recently, Xinghua was recovered by the Nationalist army, and the local Communists mixed into refugee ships, fleeing to Jiangnan. Ten refugee ships from northern Jiangsu arrived at Xidiaqiao in this county in the past few days. The murderers Xu Guixing, Xu Xueli, and Xu Guidao also mixed among them and were identified by Xu Cao, who reported it to the first squadron of the police, and all three were arrested and sent to the general bureau. According to Xu Guixing, as a Communist instructor, he watched the murder of Xu Guomin at the scene but did not do it himself. It was all done by Zhang Maolin, Wang Fuquan, and others. On that night, they killed Su Yuesong and his son and seven others, including Zhu Fenghua. Xu Xueli said that he joined the Communist army in February of last year and was promoted to squadron leader this year. He categorically denied killing people and only admitted to holding struggle meetings and dividing Xu Guomin's land. Xu Guidao claimed that he had been a soldier in the Communist army for three years and knew nothing about the killing of people. After the police bureau took their statements, considering that the case concerned the Communist army's murder and fell under the jurisdiction of military law, they presented the case to the county government on the 24th to await legal proceedings.

### Proposed Establishment of a County Bank

### Local News Briefs

Fengxian: Notorious bandit Zhang Gensheng has been wanted for a long time without success. The bandit has recently been hiding in Huhaixiang. The Fengcheng Self-Defense Force learned of this, dispatched a team to pursue him, and sent him to the county government for strict handling on the 23rd.

Luodian: In order to strengthen the existing local self-defense forces, the parachute team stationed in Luodian has specifically transferred self-defense forces from various townships to provide them with spiritual, physical, and technical training for a period of two weeks.

Changshu: The weather here has been dry recently, and the rainfall is irregular, causing various infectious diseases to spread rampantly in the townships. Diphtheria and meningitis have been discovered in the urban area.

### Moving Accumulated Coffins Requires Removing Bad Practices

I read in your newspaper's news column that the Health Bureau has decided to move the accumulated coffins in funeral parlors and coffin storage places in various districts of the city within a limited time to improve the city's environmental hygiene. I believe that this matter is indeed a task that the health authorities should undertake. However, while promoting official orders, it is also necessary to provide convenience to those moving coffins to be practical. Currently, the annual storage fees charged by various coffin storage places and funeral parlors are shockingly high. They use the excuse of the rising cost of living, but since annual fees have already been paid, if the coffin is moved out during this paid period, they extort huge "exit hall fees," sometimes exceeding or equaling the annual fee, which is difficult to understand. There must be quite a few coffin families who are hesitant to move due to economic constraints. It is advisable for the municipal authorities to promptly issue a notice strictly prohibiting the extortion of "exit hall fees" and allow people to report violations to eradicate bad practices. As for coffins transported to other locations, it is necessary to apply for a permit from the police station and find a guarantor. Although the permit fee is not high, the running around and waiting for the permit, and the humble requests, make people see it as a daunting task. In fact, if the goal is to disperse accumulated coffins, the permit application is also redundant. These are my limited opinions, and I respectfully request the municipal authorities to adopt and implement them. (Zhang Wuben)

### Vegetable Market Stallholders Plead for Sympathy

We are stallholders from the Changyang Road Qiqihar Road small vegetable market. When the Japanese devils occupied Shanghai, the vegetable market was closed, prohibiting us from operating inside, resulting in over 300 families and over 2,000 people of all ages being displaced and unemployed, suffering from hunger and cold. Under the iron heel of the invaders, there was no light, and we could only endure. After victory, we celebrated seeing the light of day again, hoping to resume our old business to maintain our livelihoods. Who would have thought that the Maotai Foreign Company would take over, claiming that they had purchased it for use as a warehouse and prohibiting its reopening, forcing stallholders to set up in the middle of the road, causing traffic congestion, frequent disputes, and increasing danger? We have repeatedly petitioned various authorities, but without satisfactory results. At this time of howling north winds, the poor people without clothes or food, with sunken faces and emaciated bodies, are in an indescribable state! In the future, when rain and snow come, there is little hope that they will not freeze or starve to death! As the saying goes, sitting and waiting for death is worse than taking a desperate risk. Now, the stallholders, driven by the danger to their lives, have been forced to automatically dismantle the bamboo fences left by the Japanese devils at the vegetable market on the morning of the 17th of this month to seek survival for thousands of people. Although they know that it will inevitably cause interference, they cannot afford to worry about it. As expected, on the morning of the 19th, more than ten police officers suddenly arrived and arrested more than 19 stallholders. The stallholders went to the Jianlin Road branch to appeal, but without results. Now, the families of those arrested are all crying and starving all day long, a tragic sight. In addition to separately submitting petitions to relevant authorities, knowing that your newspaper is the voice of the people, we specifically request that you grant us publication, respectfully hoping that social figures and fair-minded people will uphold justice and provide assistance to save lives! (Representative of the stallholders, Wang Limen)

### How to Influence Petty Traitors

At this critical juncture, the people should clearly distinguish right from wrong, for the safety and security of China depends on it. There is a matter related to the clear differentiation of right and wrong in the current Shanghai society that I hope the government authorities will pay attention to.

Today's Shanghai has become a haven for middle and lower-class collaborators from various places, or people suspected of being traitors. They either use aliases or hide their identities. Although they are not in prison, they still suffer mental punishment, have no opportunity to serve the country and society, and are despised by society. However, the pressure of life does not discriminate. Because they do not engage in production, perhaps they suffer more deeply than the people. Moreover, some of them are intellectuals, who are more sensitive to the severity of the current situation than the people. This group of people are weak-willed and without integrity. In such a turbulent environment, they are most easily seduced by heterodox ideas, which ultimately increases the chaos of the country.

Major traitors have either been executed or sentenced. The government should deal with the remaining group of middle and lower-class collaborators wisely, because in the nation-building phase, talent is a valuable resource. Although they are not talented, they are still slightly better than those without talent. Moreover, they did not really oppose the government in the past. If the government gives them an opportunity to reform, they would probably be eager to do good and get rid of the mental punishment.

My suggestion is: The government should establish repentance centers in major cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai, openly hoping that they will turn themselves in, use persuasive methods to correct their thinking, and rebuild their national outlook. Depending on the depth of their indoctrination, the length of the repentance period should be adjusted accordingly. In the future, the government should assign them jobs, starting from the lowest level, and use their achievements and effectiveness to offset their past transgressions. Then, they will have a new hope for their future and will definitely be willing to work hard to serve the country, invisibly adding a group of middle and lower-level talents.

This is to eliminate hidden dangers before they emerge, and to transform dross into something useful. I wonder if people from all walks of life can forgive them? (Shi Lai)

### Zhejiang County Magistrate Exam Results Announced; Shen Honglie to Visit Wenzhou and Taizhou after Shanghai Stopover

### Higher Examinations in Luoyang

— Special Correspondent Fan Hong

Because the Examination Yuan moved back to Luoyang, Luoyang unexpectedly became an examination area for the higher and ordinary examinations, adding a lot of status and color to Luoyang, and also giving those who are progressive or those who are frustrated in their careers without access a bright hope. This cannot but be regarded as good news for Luoyang, Henan, southern Shanxi, and Shaanxi. The reporter hopes that this good news can select many talents for the country in the future and create greater benefits for the local people.

As usual, the examinations were held simultaneously with the other ten places on October 20th. The location was the Zhougong Temple, far from the city, where the Examination Yuan is located. The examination types, registration procedures, examination methods, and examination subjects were also exactly the same as in other places. However, the number of applicants was not very enthusiastic, and it cannot be compared with other places. This is of course limited to the following reasons: (1) Inconvenient transportation, difficult roads, and applicants could not arrive on time. (2) There are not many higher education institutions in Luoyang, and there are too few students remaining in colleges and above. (3) Those who are interested in taking the examination are either unable to leave due to environmental limitations or unable to come from afar due to economic limitations. Therefore, by the deadline for registration, for the first higher examination special examination of 26 types, there were only a total of 152 applicants. On the examination day, 128 people arrived at the examination venue as scheduled. For the second Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor and Judicial Officer examinations, there were only 112 applicants, and 86 people participated in the examination. Those who failed the physical examination twice were two people in the first examination and one person in the second examination. This has already shown that this examination did not attract too much attention, and naturally did not achieve our expected hope.

Although the number of examinees was not large, the management was very strict. The examination papers were completely sealed, and the test questions were mimeographed. In particular, those who wrote the wax plate and printed them were locked in a secret room day and night until the test questions were distributed before they were allowed to leave the venue, so they were quite miserable. Dozens of employees of the Examination Yuan were busy for nearly a month without rest for the examination of over a hundred people, registration, making examination papers, borrowing furniture, numbering, etc. However, their compensation did not increase due to the heavy workload, nor was there any overtime pay like in general agencies. They were simply selecting true talents for the country.

For the convenience of the examinees, they provided accommodations and meals, solving the examinees' food and lodging difficulties. The meals were provided twice in the morning and evening, costing 700 yuan per meal, and the examinees could purchase tickets for meals with their admission tickets. The examinees all found it convenient.

Speaking of the examination expenses, a total of 1.2 million yuan, which made the Examination Yuan very difficult. According to their approximate allocation of expenses, the cost of examination papers was about 400,000 yuan, postage was about 400,000 yuan, furniture borrowing and transportation costs were 100,000 yuan, invigilation and examination fees were about 300,000 yuan, and other expenses were about 200,000 yuan, totaling 1.2 million yuan, which was definitely not enough for the application of the two examinations. However, the examination has already been successfully completed, and one cannot but admire the service spirit of the Chinese people.

### Regarding the Two Proposals on Troop Inspection and Disarmament: US Attempts to Reconcile British and Soviet Disputes; British Delegation Awaits New Instructions from London

[United Press, New York, 25th] The rift between the Soviet Union and the Western powers appeared to widen further last night, with all compromises proving ineffective. The division among the five major powers has intensified due to the Soviet Union's opposition to the restrictions proposed by the US, Britain, China, and France on the use of the veto power in the Security Council. There is also no consensus on the proposals for troop inspection and disarmament. In addition, the four foreign ministers have made no progress on the Italian and issues, with 35 outstanding issues. Last night's meeting proceeded slowly, and it was reported that Secretary of State Byrnes lamented that the foreign ministers should decide whether they want to draft peace treaties, and at the current rate, no treaty can be completed before 1950. Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union immediately replied that he was not so pessimistic.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 24th] American experts were busy all day today, trying to reconcile the British and Soviet disputes on the topic of troop inspection and disarmament. Although informal talks have been held between the delegations for 48 hours, the results will not be known until the meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the UN General Assembly tomorrow. It is reported that if the British delegation receives new instructions from London, it will propose new suggestions to answer some of the accusations made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The instructions of the British government will not go beyond three points: First, to closely link the issue of inspection of foreign troops with disarmament; Second, to closely link the inspection of foreign troops with the inspection of domestic troops; Third, to establish a supervision or management system. No matter what instructions are given, British representative Buck will undoubtedly answer the difficulties of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the American side left tonight as a time for technical discussions in order to reconcile these two topics and draft a compromise proposal that will be jointly accepted by Britain and the Soviet Union. American experts pointed out several commonalities between these two topics, so they are working hard to link them closely. The British concern about the Soviet proposal to inspect foreign troops is not because the Soviet delegation has not formally guaranteed the request for inspection, but only for the convenience of conspiracy meetings of the United Nations. People close to the Joint Chiefs of Staff admit that the slow progress of the agency's work is due to the lack of information on the strength of the armed forces of the member states of the United Nations.

### Obstructing India's Unification and Progress: Nehru Condemns the Muslim League; Congress Party Reaffirms Adherence to Non-Violence

[Special Telegram from Our London Correspondent, 25th] The Indian interim government has been in existence for two months, during which time the situation has been precarious, reaching a point today that is on the verge of collapse. London officials believe the crux of the problem lies in the Muslim League leader Jinnah's resolute refusal to participate in the Constituent Assembly. As the assembly convenes in the next two weeks, the constitutional issue will face a serious crisis. Official opinion is that unless Jinnah changes the Muslim League's uncooperative attitude, Governor-General Wavell will be forced to remove the five Muslim League ministers from the interim government. If Jinnah refuses to guarantee that the five Muslim League ministers will attend the Constituent Assembly scheduled for December 9th, there will be no solution other than for the Indian Governor to act with full authority.

[Reuter's, Meerut, 24th] The Vice-President of the Indian interim government, Nehru, stated to representatives of the Indian states at the close of the Congress Party conference today that although some states are still hesitant about the Indian Constituent Assembly, the Congress Party will make full use of this assembly to make India a republic. Nehru then condemned the Muslim League's "fascist methods" and its attitude of hatred towards the Congress Party, saying that such policies have produced another Hindu fascism, with both factions using religion as a pretext, but both being enemies of India's unification and progress.

[Reuter's, Meerut, 25th] The Chairman of the Congress Party, Kripalani, today reaffirmed the Congress Party's determination to adhere to Gandhi's non-violent principles. He pointed out that India has too many factions, and if violence is used against foreign countries, it will ultimately be used against each other. The world is in a state of bloodshed and turmoil, and there will never be peace, he said.

### Sino-Indian Relations Should Be Closer; Transportation Between the Two Countries Needs Improvement; New Chairman of the Indian Congress Party Delivers Speech

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Meerut, 24th] The newly appointed Chairman of the Congress Party, Kripalani, stated in his speech at the 54th Congress Party conference that the sincere relationship between China and India should be further strengthened, and transportation between the two countries should be improved. While we must develop and maintain equal and friendly relations with our allies, our neighbors in Asia, Australia should also be closer to us. We have a long history and cultural connection with China. Today, we still maintain a sincere relationship with China. This is the achievement of our competent Foreign Minister Nehru, and we should thank him for it. However, we are so far apart from our neighbors that we cannot directly receive telegrams from China here. Chinese telegrams must be forwarded through London, which always takes more than 24 hours. This urgently needs improvement.

### Greek Authorities Deny Infringement of Southern Airspace

Also Express Determination to Suppress Disturbances

[Reuter's, Athens, 24th] The Greek Minister of the Army, Manitas, today denied that Greek aircraft had entered Southern airspace. He announced that the Greek Air Force is not allowed to enter Southern airspace and has always strictly adhered to not exceeding it. Greece has no intention of using the Southern air routes.

[Associated Press, Athens, 24th] After inspecting northern Greece, the Greek Minister of the Army made a speech in Thessaloniki, accusing the rioters of infiltrating Greece from Yugoslavia, and said that Greece has decided to fight for independence and democracy at all costs. Greece cannot accept a totalitarian system that is contrary to its characteristics and traditions.

### New Cabinet, New Positions

[Reuter's, Athens, 24th] The Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris has completed the formation of his cabinet, and the new cabinet members were sworn in today.

### US Fleet Visiting Turkey Will Continue Southward

Destination: Marmaris Port

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Four US warships have entered the port of Izmir, Turkey, including an aircraft carrier, a cruiser, and two smaller warships.

### Iranian King Advocates Continuing Iron-Fisted Policy Towards Azerbaijan Province

Iranian Army Ordered to Go to Supervise Elections

[Associated Press, Tehran, 25th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh declared martial law in Renjen, the city recently occupied, to prevent the rumored "terrorist acts" of Azerbaijan, and ordered the central army to enter Azerbaijan Province to monitor the elections to be held there on December 7th. Renjen is located forty miles south of the Azerbaijan border, and is the northernmost point conquered by government troops since the Azerbaijan rebellion last year. According to news received today, fighting has occurred in the city, and Azerbaijan reinforcements are heading south. The Iranian King met with Prime Minister Sultaneh and the Commander of the Army, advocating the continued implementation of a "iron-fisted policy" towards the semi-autonomous government of Azerbaijan Province.

[Reuter's, Tehran, 24th] The Tabriz radio station broadcast an urgent appeal for help last night, saying that 5,000 armed men had entered the city of Renjen, killing 20 people, surrounding government offices, and attacking a police station and members of the government party. It is said that after the government troops entered the city of Renjen, they took retaliatory actions against the local residents.

It is also learned that Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh told the Governor of Azerbaijan Province, Javid, that his statement issued on Thursday, declaring that troops and police will be sent to all parts of the country to maintain peace and order during the election of members of parliament, also includes Azerbaijan Province. Therefore, the election in Azerbaijan will also be controlled by the supervisors and troops sent by the government.

### US Occupation Zone in Germany Implements Democratic Constitution

Citizens' Referendum Shows Overwhelming Support

[Associated Press, Frankfurt, 25th] The US military government announced today that the referendum held on Sunday regarding whether Germans agree with the initial democratic constitution of the Hutenberg-Baden Province in the US occupation zone of Germany resulted in 1.25 million Germans (approximately 70% of all eligible voters) casting an overwhelming majority of "yes" votes. After official approval of the results of this vote, the newly formed legislative assembly will take over the government and elect a speaker within sixteen days. At that time, the US military government will transfer its governing power to the Germans and act as a supervisor. However, if the Germans fail to eliminate the Nazis, the US military government will continue to control the right to reparations and the elimination of Nazism. Similar elections will be held next Sunday in Bavaria and Greater Hesse, in which 5 million Germans will participate in the vote. After the constitutional referendum is passed, German officials are preparing to hang the red, black, and yellow national flag, which is the first time since the war.

### Women Participate in Voting in Belgian Municipal Elections

[Associated Press, Brussels, 24th] Municipal council elections were held in Belgium today, and women will participate in the voting, which is the first time since the liberation of Belgium. The Catholic Party, which supports the exiled King Leopold, hopes to gain women's support and increase its strength. In the parliamentary elections this year, women did not have the right to vote, and although the Catholic Party won the majority of votes among all parties, it was not enough to overwhelm the government formed by various parties. As a result, the left-wing party formed a coalition government.

### Communists Win Again in the First Round of French Senate Elections; Reiterate Demand for Premiership in New Government

[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] Judging from the current situation, in the second election in France, the Communist Party seems to have surpassed President Bidault's Popular Republican Movement. However, the number of votes obtained by the two parties is very close, or it may still be the Popular Republican Movement that wins when the final statistics are announced. This time, 83,751 candidates from various parties were elected, and those elected will be re-elected to the Upper House of the National Assembly, that is, the members of the Republican Council, in two weeks. The recent statistics on the number of candidates elected by various parties are as follows: Communist Party 24,721, Popular Republican Movement 24,446, Socialist Party 14,280, Radical Socialist Party 8,381, Right-wing Group 11,742.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Yesterday's election of senators in mainland France and Corsica resulted in the Communist Party still dominating. The Ministry of Interior announced the number of seats obtained by various parties as follows: Communist Party 24,291, Popular Republican Movement 24,151, Socialist Party 14,393, Radical Socialist Party 8,089.

[Another dispatch] After the French Communist Party won the first round of the Senate elections, it again demanded to obtain the position of Prime Minister in the new government. Bond, one of the leaders of the Communist Party, told reporters that the Communist Party received 500,000 more votes than the Popular Republican Movement in this election, ranking first among all parties. There is no doubt that the French people support the Communist Party more than any other political party. The people have clearly expressed their willingness to form a democratic coalition government, with the most qualified representative of the largest party in the National Assembly serving as Prime Minister. Gaillard, the leader of the Popular Republican Movement, also expressed satisfaction with the election results, saying that the Popular Republican Movement is constantly progressing.

### Tracking Station Between Australia and South Africa; Preparing to Test Rockets

[Associated Press, Sydney, 24th] Britain is now developing a rocket test range that passes through the barren lands of western Australia and over the Indian Ocean. Finally, unmanned aircraft will travel at supersonic speeds on the world's longest range. According to people close to the Australian government, radar equipment will be installed at various observation stations along the desert line to track the rocket's whereabouts. The initial goal is to develop and test rocket boosters, but radio-controlled flight and landing will occupy an important part of the test. The launch site is probably Ankara, west of the border between Australia and South Africa. The 200-mile-wide range will extend northwest to the airspace above Christmas Island. The first section of the range is 300 miles long, and the total length will reach 3,000 miles. There is no sign when the range will be used, but preliminary actions have already begun before the Australian government approves it.

### Opposing Defense Spending Cuts; US Army Department Plans to Fight for It

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Washington, 25th] The Army Department is preparing to fight for the move by the Republican Congress to cut defense spending. According to well-informed sources, the Army Department will warn Congress that abruptly reducing defense spending in this turbulent world situation may cause serious consequences. At the same time, the department will also state that the United States cannot unilaterally implement disarmament plans before obtaining guarantees that other major powers will take the same steps.

### Gales and Heavy Rain in England

Rivers Overflow, Lowlands Become Marshland

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] Storms are currently attacking the British Isles, and in some areas, rivers have risen and flooded, causing disasters. Fields and streets are all in a vast expanse of water, turning into marshland.

### US Federal Court Summoned Lewis Yesterday; Wartime Laws Not Lifted, Strikes Violate Prohibitions

[Reuter's, Washington, 25th] The Federal Court convened today. The number of reporters listening to the trial of Lewis, the leader of 400,000 bituminous coal miners, was unprecedented since the kidnapping case of the White toddler. Lewis presented reasons today explaining why he should not be punished even though he did not comply with the court order to withdraw the notice terminating the contract between the miners and the government. If Lewis cannot provide satisfactory answers to this, Judge Goldsborough will formally try him with a jury on Wednesday or an earlier date. Today's hearing marks the beginning of a long legal battle, and the lawsuit may reach the former Supreme Court. The Washington Post reported yesterday that the government plans to ask the court to fine the miners' union $200,000 a day and sentence Lewis to imprisonment. The 60-year-old Lewis will invoke a 20-year-old law to prove that the government has no right to forcibly prohibit strikes. The coal mine strike has been going on for five days, and the government has appealed to the governors of various states to conserve coal. Director Steel of the Civilian Production Administration also called on the people to cooperate yesterday.

Widespread Industrial Shutdown

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The bituminous coal strike entered a critical week today, which could cause a widespread shutdown of national industries. The government hopes that when the court summons the chairman of the Miners' Union, Lewis, on the 25th, it can make him yield. If Federal Judge Goldsborough finds Lewis and his union guilty of contempt of court, he will severely punish the union and lightly punish Lewis, without sentencing him to imprisonment. If Lewis goes to jail, it will fulfill his wish and create a bad impression on public psychology. Except for waiting for the court hearing tomorrow, everything is temporarily suspended, and agencies have stopped working. Coal-burning railway passenger transport has been reduced by a quarter and will be implemented from midnight today. The emergency power conservation campaign in 21 states will begin tomorrow night.

State of War Not Over

[Reuter's, Washington, 25th] The United States is still in a state of war today. The fact is that the US President and Congress have not formally announced the end of the war, and many wartime emergency powers are still in effect. The formal announcement of the end of the war this time may not be faster than after the last war. The main purpose of maintaining this legal state of war is to maintain certain wartime emergency decrees. The revocation of the price control law this time may be a prelude to the termination of other emergency decrees. However, the outbreak of the coal mine strike has allowed another emergency decree to take effect, namely the order prohibiting strikes. The reason why the chairman of the Miners' Union, Lewis, is considered to have violated the law is based on this. The transition from a wartime state to a peacetime state requires careful handling. A sudden termination of wartime powers can easily lead to abnormal situations. Today, the maintenance of overseas troops, the reorganization of the army and navy, the continuation of counter-espionage work, and the control of experts are still affected by 300 to 400 kinds of wartime emergency measures.

[Reuter's, New York, 24th] Since the US government called for emergency austerity measures to deal with the situation caused by the coal mine strike, the acting Governor of New York State, Hanley, has declared a state of emergency.

### Economic Merger Plan for British and American Occupation Zones in Germany; British Cabinet Expected to Pass

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: According to British diplomatic circles, the British Cabinet meeting today may pass the plan to merge the British and American zones in Germany.

### Truman's Mother Turns 94; President Quietly Returns Home to Celebrate

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] Today is the 94th birthday of President Truman's mother. The President flew to his hometown of Grandview, Missouri, this morning to raise a glass to his mother for her birthday. Afterwards, he returned to Washington on the same day. The President's trip was extremely secret in advance, and it was not announced to the press until his plane arrived at the airport here.

### Soviet Union Rapidly Catches Up in Atomic Energy Research; Building Manufacturing Plant in the Caucasus

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] A correspondent from the "News Chronicle" in Istanbul reported that according to guests from the Black Sea, the Soviet Union is building a large-scale atomic energy manufacturing plant at the foot of Mount Camp Luz in the Caucasus. Many Soviet scientists, assisted by German experts, are supervising the project, which is being carried out in extreme secrecy. Nearby farmers have been evacuated. It is said that once the plant is completed, it will be comparable to the atomic energy laboratory built in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA.

### Japanese Parliament Opens Amidst Strict Purge; Socialist Party to Demand Dissolution of Parliament

[Remodeling Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese provisional parliament convened today, but the labor unrest is spreading across the country and has not subsided slightly. In addition, the recent expansion of the scope of the purge has caused deep anxiety in political, economic, and public opinion circles. The government's measures are not sufficient to satisfy public expectations. There seems to be a subtle shadow in Japanese political circles. During this session of parliament, the dissolution of parliament may occur. The current government is not prepared to submit important amendment bills such as the House of Representatives election law, the labor adjustment law, the labor standards law, and the wage standards law. If the Socialist Party firmly demands that the government submit them, the parliament will fall into chaos, and the government's position will inevitably be shaken. The bills prepared by the government are the "Imperial Household Code Amendment" bill, the Imperial Household Economic Law bill, the Cabinet Law bill, the National Assembly Law bill, and the Court Law bill.

[Another dispatch] With the provisional parliament already convened, the Japanese Socialist Party convened a general meeting of Socialist Party members today to discuss attitudes and countermeasures, and elected Mizutani Chozaburo as the chairman of the "Parliamentary Countermeasures" committee. Mizutani then said that the Socialist Party will take a purely opposition stance towards this provisional parliament, severely criticizing the government's fragility and incompetence, and demanding the dissolution of parliament.

### Sudden Explosion at Tokyo Army Warehouse; Stored Machines for Reparations

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th, United Press] The former Army warehouse here was suddenly destroyed by an explosion of unknown origin on the night of the 23rd. The warehouse currently stores machines designated for reparations. The explosion affected the residents around the warehouse, injuring five people, two of whom were seriously injured. After the explosion, a fire broke out immediately, but fortunately, efforts were made to rescue it, and it did not turn into a disaster.

### French Miner's Family Tragedy: Nine Die Together

[Agence France-Presse, Bethune, France, 24th] A horrific tragedy was discovered here this morning. Nine bodies were hoisted from a nearby canal, tied together with ropes. The deceased were the miner Dumortier and his wife, their four sons and three daughters. The clues to the tragedy were discovered last night, when two pairs of pants and a headband were found on the shore, presumably belonging to the children who drowned. The oldest was 15 years old, and the youngest was two years old. The reason for the suicide is said to be that the court decided to remove five of the miner's children to be raised by a public orphanage, because the miner was a weak-willed drunkard who could not educate his children. However, the miner was stubborn and said that he would rather kill all seven children than have five of them taken away.

### Egyptian Students Stage Large Demonstration; Demand British Troops Withdraw Quickly; Sudanese Leader to Visit Britain to Fight for Complete Sovereignty

[Associated Press, Cairo, 24th] Thousands of Egyptian students continued to demonstrate today, demanding the withdrawal of British troops. Students from Fouad University shouted "Down with Sidky, Down with Bevin," and rushed out of the school gate, where police opened fire, and three people fell to the ground. Several police officers were also injured by bullets. In the Genia district, middle school students threw stones at the police and set trees on fire. The students demanded that British troops withdraw immediately and that Sudan be merged.

[Reuter's, Khartoum, Sudan, 24th] One of the Sudanese religious and political leaders, Mandi, announced today that he will go to London on the 26th of this month to fight for the complete sovereignty of Sudan. He will speak to British leaders such as Attlee and has arranged to meet with Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky on his way back.

### Husseini Suddenly Assassinated; Vice-Chairman of the Palestinian Arab Higher Executive Committee

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 24th] The Vice-Chairman of the Palestinian Arab Higher Executive Committee, Fuzi Husseini, was assassinated last night. Husseini lived in the village of Tor Shan, east of Jerusalem. He was lured to the street and shot four times, dying immediately. The murderer escaped into the darkness. Husseini had supported a compromise between Arabs and Jews on the Palestinian issue and had recently received threats that something unfavorable would happen.

### South African Indians Appeal

— Translated by Yu Jing from "Asia and America"

The author, Kotri, is the U.S. representative of the South African Indian Passive Resistance Committee.  He has written this article to inform outsiders about the reality of the anti-Indian movement in South Africa and appeal to countries worldwide for sympathy.

We Indians, like any other people in the world, have inalienable "human rights." Since the outbreak of World War II, our two million Indian compatriots have also fought for the same goals. Thousands of Indians sacrificed their lives in North Africa and elsewhere for the war effort. However, this sacrifice, at least in South Africa, has been completely in vain. Eighty-six years ago, Indians came to South Africa as invited immigrants. I was born in South Africa, and my ancestors migrated three generations ago. Yet, we are nominally considered citizens of South Africa.  Indian compatriots who came to South Africa were very hardworking and able to endure hardship. They toiled in coal mines, on railways, and in sugarcane plantations. They created the current prosperity of South Africa with their sweat and blood. They settled in South Africa for its wealth and became natives.  They also enjoyed national and local voting rights. No one hindered their progress, and the people of South Africa considered them good citizens. But—in recent years, we have witnessed the status of the Indian people in South Africa being snatched away.  New laws are passed every year to undermine our freedom. Our national and local voting rights have been deprived. Laws restricting our business rights have also been passed.  On trains and buses, we must sit separately; in parks, there are designated seats for us; post offices have separate counters for us; in national government, local government, and courts, we can only sit in separate seats. Up until now, there have been sixty laws specifically designed to restrict our freedom of movement and hinder our economic and social development. Now, things are getting worse. Two laws have been enacted that are extremely damaging to Indians: the Asiatic Land Tenure Act and the Indian Representation Act of 1946. These two laws fundamentally exclude Indians from South African society and deprive us of our freehold and property rights. Gandhi and Nehru have vociferously protested these laws, and China has also lodged a protest. George Bernard Shaw said: "The Union of South Africa is decadent and snobbish. Because they cannot keep up with the intelligence and shrewdness of the Indians, they persecute the Indian people with whips. The laws they have enacted are no different from the methods used by the Germans to persecute the Jews!" The newly enacted laws are not only humiliating to the Indian people but are already harming them. Two million European immigrants occupy 150 seats in Parliament, while 250,000 Indians only have the right to elect three representatives, who must still sit in separate seats. Recently, they simply enacted a law to abolish these few representatives, and even these three representatives have been replaced by Europeans. This is the third-class citizenship that South Africa gives us. In September, at the United Nations General Assembly, South Africa unreasonably explained India's grievances by saying: "This is entirely an internal matter of South Africa, and the South African government's policies towards its citizens do not require the intervention of the United Nations." Isn't this the same excuse that Hitler used to justify the persecution of the Jews? India deeply resents South Africa's mistreatment of their descendants and has now cut off trade with South Africa through its highest officials, imposing economic sanctions. Although our ancestors were of Indian ethnicity, we have been deeply influenced by Western civilization. If we have sufficient opportunity, we will take on national responsibilities. South Africa is our home! South Africa is where we were born. Since we are nurtured by her land, we ask for the same opportunity to develop her! To deal with the abuse, the old methods used by Gandhi in South Africa thirty-five years ago to combat anti-Indian laws have been adopted by us. Now, the Indian people of South Africa are using passive resistance to fight against the government. In protest against the newly enacted land law, hundreds of Indian men and women continue to sit on vacant land belonging to the city government, which is legally forbidden to Indians. The South African government takes these Indians away and locks them up every day. Now, the prisons hold more than 430 people who have been sentenced to hard labor. The South African government must provide an answer to the condemnation of world opinion. Democracy cannot exclude the Indians of South Africa, democracy should be for all the people of the world.

### Customs Releases Trade Statistics: Last Month's Import-Export Ratio Was Twelve to One

According to the Jianghai Customs: Last month, China's foreign trade saw imports totaling 202.700645 billion Legal Tender (法幣), while exports totaled 17.587172 billion Legal Tender.  Although the value of imports decreased by 19.905525 billion Legal Tender compared to September's total of 222.600617 billion Legal Tender, the value of exports decreased by 35.932991 billion Legal Tender compared to September's total of 53.520163 billion Legal Tender. In other words, the ratio of import value to export value last month was approximately twelve to one, and the ratio of last month's export value to September's was one to three. It is understood that the slight decrease in imports compared to September is due to the effect of the government's implementation of the new exchange rate on August 19th. The sluggishness of exports, besides the high domestic prices and weak production, other factors such as the U.S. maritime worker strike also greatly affected the shipment of our country's goods according to the established schedule. As for last month's imports, raw cotton still accounted for the largest portion (same as in September), followed by ships, then wool, and then chemical products and books/paper.  Among exports, oils and fats ranked first (same as in September), followed by pig bristles, then tea, and leather in fourth place.

### Fire Prevention Propaganda Day: A Convoy of Fire Trucks Slowly Moves Through the City Center; Fire Department Hosts Reporters to Tour Facilities

[Report from this newspaper] To raise public awareness of fire hazards and prevent them from occurring, the Police Department's Fire Department has launched a Fire Prevention Campaign Week to universally instill fire prevention knowledge among citizens. Yesterday was the first day of the campaign. Starting at 9:30 AM, a parade of fire vehicles was held. Participating units included 17 types of fire trucks from nine fire districts, including Central, Hongkou, Xinzha, Jing'an, Yangshupu, Yichang Road, Taishan Road, and Wuxing Road, totaling 40 vehicles. The parade was under the overall command of Zhou Zhaoxiang, Director of the Fire Department, with Ye Binyong, Chief of the Second Division, as his deputy. The procession started from the intersection of Yu Garden Road and Dihua Road, led by a blue banner with the words "Fire Prevention Campaign Week," followed by a military band, giant oil paintings, slogans, etc.  Along the way, loudspeakers broadcast messages to the public, and passersby stopped to watch.

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Municipal Fire Department hosted a press conference at the department's conference room at 280 Henan Road. Those in attendance numbered over a hundred people, including Police Chief Xuan Tiewu, Deputy Chief Yu Shuping, Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang, Chief Captain Xia Guoliang, Chief of the Second Division Ye Binyong, and reporters from various newspapers. The conference was chaired by Chief Xuan, who gave a three-point statement:

Using Spirit to Compensate for Material Deficiencies

(1) The reason why fires in Shanghai have been so serious lately is due to the increased population after the war. Before 1937, the total population of Shanghai was only over three million, but now it has increased to over four million. The residential areas in Nanshi and Zhabei have been largely destroyed, so the housing problem is extremely crowded. Stoves are set up everywhere on roads and in alleys, making ignition very easy. In addition, people do not pay attention to fire prevention; a small spark can lead to a major disaster. Recalling the era of the former foreign concessions, foreigners paid great attention to fire prevention, establishing a fire department and attaching great importance to it. Their expenditures were always above 5%, while now it is only 1%. Therefore, the fire department has been shouldering an excessive responsibility for more than a year, using the "spirit" of the people to compensate for material deficiencies, so that no major disasters have occurred in the city for more than a year.

Renovating Equipment and Rectifying Discipline

(2) The current equipment and vehicles used by the fire department were taken over from the puppet government era, and the puppet government took them over from the former Municipal Council period, so most of them are already fifty years old. If they were abroad, they would have been renovated long ago. Because the fire-fighting equipment is too old, defects such as holes in the hoses can reduce the efficiency of the work. Revision and supplementation are urgently needed, but this is difficult to achieve at present due to economic constraints.

(3) Regarding the discipline of firefighters, rumors arose and malpractices abounded in the former concession era, such as firefighters demanding prices before putting out fires. Since I took over, although I dare not guarantee that every firefighter can be clean and self-disciplined, I can at least guarantee that they dare not openly take advantage of people's misfortune with the intention of extortion; otherwise, citizens are allowed to report the facts, and I will punish them severely.

Public Exhibition of Firefighting Equipment

Finally, Chief Xuan said that the fire department has two tasks——"extinguishing" and "prevention." "Extinguishing" is actively putting out a fire after it has broken out. "Prevention" is taking effective precautions before a fire occurs.

After Chief Xuan finished speaking, Chief Ye Binyong and District Captain Xu Liren led the reporters to visit the third floor, where various state-of-the-art firefighting equipment were on public display, along with the most ideal architectural models of theaters and warehouses. At around 5:00 PM, a film entitled "The Chemistry of Fire" was shown. The film was produced by the Asia Petroleum Company and was divided into several segments such as "Where Does Fire Come From?" and "How to Prevent Fire?" The film was about twenty minutes long, and the reception ended around 6:00 PM.

Last night at 7:00 PM, Mayor Wu also gave a speech on the meaning and knowledge of fire prevention on the police radio station. During this week, all movie theaters will show fire prevention slides before the films, fire prevention slogans will be posted on all streets, and all scheduled programs will be carried out separately as decided.

### Fuxing Island Fisheries Administration's Scope Expanding; Owns Latest American Fishing Vessels, Fears No Wind or Waves; 570,000 Pounds of Fresh Fish Caught in Two Months

[Report from this newspaper] The Fuxing Island Fisheries Administration, jointly operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), has seen its scope of work expand since its establishment. Recently, it began utilizing CRRRA materials to build 10,000 wooden boats, which will be used to supply Chinese fishermen in the future.

The Administration currently has 34 of the latest American fishing vessels. By the end of this year, 16 more will be added, and more will continue to come to China in the future. These fishing vessels were built in 1944 by the California shipbuilding company in Coleburg. They are equipped with the latest type of echo sounders and radio telephones, which can be used to direct the vessels in the sea and communicate with other vessels regardless of distance. Most of the fishing vessels have a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour, a fishing capacity of 135 tons, an engine power of 400 horsepower per hour, a gasoline capacity of 6,000 gallons, and a water capacity of 1,500 gallons. Each voyage does not require refueling or water and can travel directly for 2,000 nautical miles. The fishing nets are 114 feet long and 120 feet wide. These fishing vessels are safe in the ocean even in the event of strong winds and waves. When coming to China from the United States, each vessel is assigned five to seven American fishing crew members. Their compensation is paid by the Fisheries Administration, and each crew member's service contract is for six months. Their main task is to train Chinese fishery personnel in the use of new machinery. Currently, there are over 100 foreign personnel. The fish caught during the trial period of these vessels are sold at low prices in the fish market, and the proceeds are used to fund the Fisheries Administration. The amount of fish caught is extremely surprising. From September 11th to October 31st, 17 vessels were dispatched, catching 197,259.5 pounds of fish. From November 1st to the 14th, only 12 vessels were dispatched, catching 374,574 pounds of fish. The Fisheries Administration has also established a reception center on Fuxing Island, headed by Li Zongdao. The reception center is fully equipped and can accommodate 200 people. It will be expanded in the future.

### Gruesome Case of Dismembered Body in a Box; Head Found at Yokohama Bridge, Body at Wuhua Road; Thirteen Knife Wounds to the Head, Ears and Nose Cut Off, Right Eye Wounded About an Inch, Legs Cut into Four Pieces

[Report from this newspaper] At around 8:00 AM yesterday, another bizarre case of a body in a box occurred in the city. The location was in a small bay near Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road. At the time, a passerby saw a medium-sized brown leather travel bag left on the beach and approached it to investigate. He found bloodstains on the box, and half of the bag was submerged in the water. He immediately reported it to the nearby police officer, who relayed it to the North Sichuan Road Police Station. The station dispatched Judicial Section Chief Zhou Nan and police officer Zhang Decai to investigate. They retrieved the box and opened it. Inside, there was oil paper, and inside the oil paper, there was a rectangular object wrapped in a gray military blanket. After opening it, they shockingly found a male head and two legs and two feet that had been dismembered, a bloody and unbearable sight. They immediately telegraphed the Criminal Investigation Division of the General Police Station and photographed the body box for the record. Before long, police officers from the No. 12499 Security Team of the Hongzhen police substation of the Ti Lan Qiao Police Station, while passing through the wasteland at the intersection of Wuhua Road and Tianbao Road, also discovered a section of a headless and footless male corpse wrapped in a bed sheet. They immediately reported it to the substation. Station Chief Zhang immediately ordered Judicial Section Chief Ma to rush to investigate and telegraphed the General Police Station for the record. When the Yokohama Bridge box with the body parts was discovered, the General Police Station, after receiving the report, immediately ordered the two bodies to be moved to the Ti Lan Qiao substation. At 11:00 AM, the General Police Station dispatched personnel to examine the bodies. The head and body matched, and the skin color was the same. The deceased was forty years old, had hair, and had a total of thirteen knife wounds to the head. The left ear and nose had been cut off, and there was a one-inch deep knife wound to the right eye. The fatal wound was on the head, presumably the victim was first stabbed to death by the murderer while sleeping, and then dismembered. The legs were cut into four sections, and one leg had two black marks. The body was wearing a white cotton undershirt and a pajama top, and looked like a businessman. After the examination, the body was transported to the autopsy center on Changde Road. As of late last night, the police station was still conducting a strict investigation.

### Site for Next Municipal Council Meeting Resolved; Borrowing Zhengshi Middle School; Meeting Date Not Yet Set

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Council needed to find a new meeting place because the former Japanese Association's original site on Dith Avenue would only be received via transfer after the US military's agreed deadline, February 14th, next year. The Council had repeatedly contacted and inspected meeting places everywhere, but none were suitable. Yesterday, Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan accompanied Secretary-General Xiang Changquan to inspect the auditorium of Zhengshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road. It was quite suitable for meetings. After contacting the school, it was decided that the second Municipal Council meeting would be held at the school, and Zhengshi Middle School agreed to lend it free of charge. The Municipal Council Secretariat is responsible for all arrangements. The issue of the meeting place for the second meeting has finally been resolved, but the meeting date has not yet been determined.

### Resolving the Surplus Materials Entanglement; Lida Trading Proposes a Suggestion; Sell All Remaining Pharmaceuticals Back to the US at Original Price; Three US Implementing Agencies Discuss Methods

[Report from this newspaper] Among the surplus pharmaceutical materials sold by the US Materials Clearance Committee to Lida International Trading Company, following blood plasma, the US also intended to retrieve anesthetics, surgical instruments, and other items. The merchants felt extremely troubled by this, and the details have been reported in previous issues. It is now known that Lida Trading Company (in fact, Chengxin Trading Company, because Lida has already transferred ownership of the batch of pharmaceuticals) has formally suggested to the Materials Clearance Committee to sell all the remaining pharmaceuticals, including blood plasma, back to the US at the original purchase price plus the loading, unloading, warehousing, and other fees paid by the company, in order to avoid future troubles and seek a thorough resolution. Yesterday morning, Mr. Fang Fushu, a lawyer representing the company, contacted Mr. Davis of the Materials Clearance Committee by telephone and then expressed this suggestion in a formal letter. In the afternoon, the US Materials Clearance Committee and the three implementing agencies of the US Navy and Marine Corps held a meeting to discuss how to compensate for the price of blood plasma, retrieve the anesthetics, or accept Lida Trading's suggestion to buy back all the pharmaceuticals with cash for the whole discussion. The meeting had not finished by evening. It is expected that a decision will be made today on which method to adopt.

The original purchase price of all the pharmaceuticals was US$1.65 million. Among them, there were over 39,000 units of blood plasma, which would be worth US$975,000 if calculated at the market price of US$25 per unit. However, when the two parties initially negotiated, Lida requested that the US pay only US$520,000 for the blood plasma.

Yesterday, Prosecutor Gu again summoned Zhou Fushan, the factory owner, Chen Shaoting, the original informant, and Zhang Ganquan, a hardware merchant suspected of purchasing enemy property, for questioning.

### Organizing a Syndicate to Build Housing for Public School and Government Employees - Base Sites Are Being Negotiated, and Material Shortages Are Not a Concern - The Real Estate Department of the China Trust Bureau Has Full Confidence

[Special Report from this newspaper] The Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau recently drafted a "Measures for Subsidizing the Construction of Housing for Public and Education Personnel" to solve the housing problem for public and education personnel, and it has been approved by the Four Joint Offices. Amid the housing shortage, this is undoubtedly good news for public and education personnel!

According to the person in charge of the Real Estate Department of the China Trust Bureau, this subsidy-based house building plan is planned to be piloted in Nanjing and Shanghai, with a total amount of 20 billion yuan. Currently, efforts are being made to promote the organization of a subsidy syndicate to raise funds. At the same time, preparations are being made for building materials and base sites required for house construction.

According to the draft of this plan, houses are divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E. The prices are also divided into five types: 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, 35 million, and 40 million yuan (including the base price). The total subsidy amount of 20 billion yuan is expected to build nearly a thousand houses of various sizes. It is said that after all the plans are arranged, construction can begin in February next year, and it is estimated that it can be completed in four months.

Before construction begins, the China Trust Bureau will publicly announce reservations in newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai. Reservation applicants are limited to public and education personnel serving in government agencies, schools, cultural, and educational organizations. When making a reservation, 30% of the house price (including the base price) must be paid in advance. The remaining 70% will be charged interest at a monthly rate of 2.5%, and will be amortized equally over 12 months from the date the house is completed and occupied. As an example: taking an E-type house worth 10 million yuan (including the base price), 30% of the construction cost, which is 3 million yuan, must be paid in advance when making a reservation. The remaining 7 million yuan will be charged interest at a monthly rate of 2.5%, and will be amortized equally over 12 months from the date of occupancy. This is no more than approximately 600,000 yuan per month. After the one-year period expires and the construction cost is paid off, the China Trust Bureau will hand over the land ownership certificate to you, and you will be your own landlord and house owner, which is a permanent solution!

Four Ideal Locations

Perhaps readers are eager to know the location, layout, style, and equipment of these houses. Therefore, the reporter extracted a summary from the draft and reported it separately as follows:

In Shanghai, the base sites for the houses are currently being purchased by the China Trust Bureau from the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Industries. The total area of this batch of enemy and puppet properties is 300 mu, scattered in ten locations, including:

No. 63, Jiangwan Road Flower Garden - 14.523 mu
North Fourth Avenue (near Jiangwan Road) - 9.219 mu
Shanyin Road, Sida Road - 29.048 mu
Zhoujiazui Road - 23.196 mu
Haig Road, Lilac Garden - 14.523 mu
No. 1423, Xinzha Road - 6.373 mu
No. 648, East Sports Club Road - 32.674 mu
No. 490, Huanyang Road - 5.328 mu
Intersection of Pushi Road and Haig Road - 6.192 mu
No. 100, Hongqiao Road - 140.000 mu

Among the above ten base sites, the China Trust Bureau believes that the first four listed are ideal in terms of location suitability and transportation convenience. These houses for public and education personnel will be built on these four base sites first. The China Trust Bureau has submitted the official business of purchasing this batch of enemy and puppet properties to the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Industries. It will be processed as soon as the Bureau of Enemy Properties receives the approval from the Executive Yuan.

Five Different Styles

The layout, size, building materials, and number of rooms vary for the five types of houses. They are described separately as follows:

Type A is further divided into types A and B, but the building materials are the same: cement plaster exterior walls, reinforced concrete flat roof, foreign pine flooring, Liu'an plywood interior doors, and steel windows.

Type A is a single-bay three-story Western-style house, with a base area of 1,370 square feet. The ground floor has a living room, a kitchen, and a servant's room. The second floor has a large bedroom, a small bedroom, and a bathroom. The third floor also has a large and small bedroom, and a flat roof area. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 40 million yuan.

Type B is a double-bay three-story apartment, with a base area of 3,000 square feet. The ground floor has a living room, a dining room, a study room, a preparation room, and a kitchen. The second and third floors each have two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 110 million yuan. The price is relatively high, but each floor can form a separate unit and be sold separately.

The building materials for types B and C are cement plaster exterior walls, red tile roofs, fir flooring, secondary wood interior doors, and foreign pine windows.

Type B is a one-and-a-half-bay two-story house, with a base area of 1,050 square feet. The ground floor has a dining room with an attached living room, a kitchen, and a servant's room. The second floor has three bedrooms of different sizes and a bathroom. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 35 million yuan.

Type C is a single-bay two-story house, with a base area of 782 square feet. The ground floor has a living room, a kitchen, and a servant's room. The second floor has two bedrooms of different sizes and a bathroom. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 30 million yuan.

The building materials for types D and E are lime plaster exterior walls, red tile roofs, reinforced concrete and fir flooring, and fir doors and windows.

Type D is a single-bay two-story house, with a base area of 700 square feet. The ground floor has a living room and a kitchen. The second floor has a bedroom, a bathroom, and a small room. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 20 million yuan.

Type E is a single-bay pseudo-two-story house, with a base area of 384 square feet. The ground floor has a living room, a kitchen, and a toilet. The second floor has one large bedroom. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 10 million yuan.

Profits are Equal to Zero

The reporter saw that the "profit" column of the construction cost sheet for this batch of houses was marked with a zero. This indicates that the China Trust Bureau did not include any profits when constructing this batch of houses and was purely "aiming" to serve public and education personnel. The estimated construction costs were compiled a month ago. Now that time has passed, these estimates may have changed somewhat. However, the person in charge of the Real Estate Department of the China Trust Bureau is fully confident in the construction of this batch of houses. He said: If general financial institutions feel that the interest rate on the 20 billion yuan construction subsidy is too low and are not interested in participating in the syndicate, the China Trust Bureau has decided to provide the subsidy independently, so funding is not expected to be a problem. As for building materials, the China Trust Bureau has brick and tile kilns that received enemy property and can produce bricks and tiles in large quantities. The China Trust Bureau also has a sufficient supply of other materials such as wood, steel, cement, and sanitary ware. Therefore, there is no need to worry about a shortage of building materials. Now, all that remains is to negotiate the purchase of this batch of enemy and puppet properties. Once the purchase is completed, planning for the construction of the new houses can begin.

Public and education personnel, patiently wait for your new houses!

### Grain and Goods Case - Truth Will Come Out - Wang Daren and Eight Others - Indicted by the District Procuratorate - Yang Xizhi and Li Chongnian Not Prosecuted

[Report from this newspaper] The grain and goods fraud case, which shook the whole country and attracted the attention of all parties, and which involves nearly half of the personnel, has been concluded by the District Court Procuratorate. Of the ten defendants, eight, including Wang Daren, have been indicted. Two people have not been prosecuted: Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Department, and Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Tax Department of the Grain Department. Prosecutor Wu Qihua has successively completed the indictments and non-prosecution decisions, and after they are printed, they will be sent to the defendants who are in custody or have posted bail. The entire case will then be transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court. It is said that the District Court may adopt a joint trial to hear the case, in accordance with the Court Organization Law. The original text of the non-prosecution decision No. 3881 of the Shanghai District Court for the year 35 is copied below:

Defendant Yang Xizhi, male, 37 years old, from Chongqing, residing at No. 26, Lane 622, Linsen Middle Road, working as the Shanghai Grain Administration Special Commissioner of the Grain Department. Li Chongnian, male, 41 years old, from Huaiyin, residing at No. 50, Guba Road, working as the Director of the Field Tax Department of the Grain Department, Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee.

In the case of the above-mentioned defendants being suspected of corruption (Case No. 2443 of the 35th year of the investigation application), after the investigation by this prosecutor, it is considered that non-prosecution should be applied. The reasons are stated as follows:

Yang Zhixi

Defendant Yang Xizhi, in February of this year, because the former Mayor of Shanghai, Qian Dajun, convened a meeting of heads of various agencies in the Municipal Government. They all believed that the grain merchants had been destroyed by the enemy puppets and their organizations had been unsound and their funds limited for many years. The population of Shanghai was dense, and the grain consumption depended entirely on transportation from various places. After unanimous agreement at the meeting, they suggested that the government should provide grain loans to enrich the people's food supply. The defendant then forwarded the opinions of the heads of the various agencies to the Grain Department. However, whether the government agreed to provide the loan and how to do so was not something that the defendant could decide. Moreover, when President Song of the Executive Yuan came to Shanghai in early March, he instructed him to go to the United States for another mission. The defendant flew to Chongqing on March 7 to report to the Grain Department, returned to Shanghai on March 10, and flew to the United States on a US military plane at 9:00 AM on March 14. At that time, the government had not approved the grain loan method. External reports said that the decision to provide the grain loan and various uses were all planned by the defendant before going abroad, which is not consistent with the facts. In addition, there is no other evidence to prove that he committed a crime, and it is difficult to hold him responsible for corruption.

Li Chongnian

When the grain loan method was implemented, defendant Li Chongnian accompanied Xu Kan, the Minister of Grain, to Shanghai to assist in revising the clauses of the loan method and introduced Tongyi and Jiangbei companies in northern Jiangsu to participate in the loan undertaking. Defendant admitted to this. However, the grain loan affairs were not under his jurisdiction. Accompanying the superior officer on inspections and participating in the revision of the clauses was a normal matter, and it is difficult to say that he had the intention of facilitating others' misconduct. Although the Tongyi and Jiangbei companies in northern Jiangsu, which he introduced to Wan Molin, were granted grain loans, the defendant argued that he only knew that the two companies had strong organizations, large capital, and were good at doing things, so he mentioned them to Wan Molin as a reference during the conversation. This is consistent with the facts, and since the Tongyi and Jiangbei companies in northern Jiangsu did not commit any crimes, the defendant's introduction cannot be said to have been collusion for profit. Since the defendant lacks criminal evidence, it is difficult to constitute any criminal responsibility.

In summary, the criminal suspicion of defendant Yang Xizhi and Li Chongnian in the Shanghai grain loan case is insufficient. In accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, non-prosecution is ordered. Prosecutor Wu Qihua, Shanghai District Court. November 23, 35th year of the Republic of China.

### Wei Te Le's Preliminary Trial Today - Accused of Colluding with the Enemy

[Report from this newspaper] The High Court is scheduled to hold a preliminary trial of Wei Te Le Elly Widler's case of colluding with the enemy at 2:30 PM today. Wei is a Swiss national, 58 years old. He was previously accused of forging US dollars, but after investigation by the US military headquarters, it was believed that the evidence was insufficient and the case was withdrawn. However, the Songhu Garrison Command believed that he had other crimes of colluding with the enemy and transferred the case to the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate for investigation, which filed a public prosecution. The indictment lists seven crimes committed by the defendant: before the Pacific War, he sold a large amount of copper to the Japanese. After the concession fell, he obtained a special pass due to special relations and had a secret code booklet, which was obviously suspected of being a spy. In addition, he also possessed printing machinery and counterfeited US dollars and Chinese stamps. Wei Te Le is currently detained in Shanghai Prison and has hired lawyer Tang Huaiyu to defend him.

### Establishment of the Maritime Safety Association

Shao Xiehua and Others Elected as Directors and Supervisors

The Maritime Safety Association, founded by martyr Shao Bai, is composed of Chinese seafarers. It has a history of more than 20 years and has more than 2,000 members, so the association's affairs are quite developed. After the victory, the association was ordered to reorganize until now. The association's affairs have been put on the right track, so a general meeting of members' representatives was held for the first time after the reinstatement at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 150 representatives from various ships attended, and the Seafarers' Party Department and the Seafarers' Union sent personnel to attend for guidance. The articles of association were adopted, and Shao Xiehua, Huang Qingfang, Zhou Mingyao, and other eleven people were elected as directors, and Fang Dongshan and other five people were elected as supervisors.

### Deadline for Smokers to Quit Within the Year; Expanded Promotion Begins December 16th; Establishment of the Committee for Eliminating Opium and Narcotics

The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Eliminating Opium and Narcotics held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Mayor Wu addressed the meeting, stating that the prohibition of opium and narcotics is the government's most important national policy. The public is well aware that the prohibition of opium and narcotics has a significant impact on the nation and a substantial effect on national health. It cannot be achieved solely by a government decree. The mission of the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Eliminating Opium and Narcotics is to achieve the goal of eliminating opium and narcotics through publicity and reporting. He expressed hope that all sectors of society would work hard to advance this cause and complete the mission of banning narcotics. This was followed by a speech by Liu Xuehai, which stated, "The prohibition of opium and narcotics has been actively promoted by the municipal government in the past and has had a great effect. However, due to the complexity of Shanghai's environment, the desired goal has not been achieved. Mayor Wu has always advocated for being practical and realistic. Now, he calls on all sectors of society to organize the Committee for Eliminating Opium and Narcotics to take responsibility for providing advice and guidance. In the future, all sectors will also organize the Shanghai Anti-Narcotics Association. Various public opinion organizations and legal entities will stand from the people's perspective to assist the government in implementing the anti-narcotics policy, uphold the national policy of banning opium and narcotics, eliminate obstacles to construction, and promote it as much as possible, with the hope of completing the century-long plan to ban narcotics." After Liu's speech, the following proposals were discussed:

(1) How to determine the units participating in this committee. Resolution: The Committee for Eliminating Opium and Narcotics will be organized by the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Youth League, the Garrison Headquarters, the Military Police Regiment, the Local Court, the Municipal Council, the Mayor, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, the Director of the Municipal Government’s Administrative Affairs, the Director of the Municipal Government Information Office, the Director of the Health Bureau, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, the Director of the Police Bureau, the Director of the Education Bureau, the Director of Civil Affairs, the Director of the Opium and Narcotics Investigation Institute, the Shanghai Branch of the Post-War Relief Administration, the Anti-Opium and Narcotics Affairs Office dispatched by the Ministry of Interior, the High Court, and the New Life Movement Association.

(2) How to allocate the organizational rules of this committee. Resolution: It was decided to appoint Fang Zhichao as the Secretary-General of the committee. The Secretary-General will draft the organizational rules and submit them for discussion at the next meeting.

(3) How to prepare for the expanded publicity of the elimination of opium and narcotics. Resolution: It was decided that the expanded publicity will begin on December 16th. The Anti-Opium and Narcotics Commissioner's Office, the Civil Affairs Department, the News Agency, the Education Bureau, the Police Bureau, and other agencies will allocate proposals before December 5th and submit them for discussion at the meeting.

(4) Plan for establishing branch committees of the Municipal Anti-Narcotics Association in various districts. Resolution: A letter will be sent to the Municipal Council to initiate this.

(5) How to set a deadline for registered smokers to quit opium and narcotics. Resolution: In the shortest possible time, the registration of smokers should be accelerated for investigation. The investigation must be completed before the general reporting date of January 1, 1947.

### Engineering Society Youth Group Scheduled to Meet Next Month on the 5th

The Youth Group of the Chinese International Engineering Society is a purely academic research group. Its members are mostly young people serving in the city's industrial sector and various public utilities. Under the guidance and support of Chinese and foreign engineers, they conduct various studies to enhance their skills. Monthly meetings, academic lectures, and visits to major factories are also held. It is learned that the next meeting has been scheduled for the 5th of next month at the Changli Company. At that time, automotive engineering expert Mr. Gu Mengni will be invited to give a lecture. The meeting will be convened by Mr. Wu Daming, the secretary of the society (Telephone Company).

### Fifth Allocation of Supplies for Public Educators

One Can of Evaporated Milk and Two Bars of Soap; Payment and Pickup Dates Scheduled

The fifth allocation of supplies at the Supplies Allocation Office for Public Educators in this city will be one can (one pound) of Chrysanthemum brand evaporated milk, priced at 700 yuan, and two bars of foreign soap, priced at 700 yuan per bar, totaling 1,400 yuan. The total payment for the above two items is 2,100 yuan per person.

The payment and pickup dates are classified as follows: Municipal certificates from November 28th to 30th, National certificates from December 2nd to 4th, and Vocational certificates from December 5th to 7th.

### New Tax Law Affects Municipal Revenue; Director of Finance Bureau Requests Consideration in the Capital

[Report from our newspaper] The new tax law recently passed by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that banquet donations will be taxed at different levels, with a starting point set. Entertainment donations are stipulated not to exceed 25%. In addition, the collection of housing taxes and vehicle license taxes has also been generally reduced. The municipal authorities believe that this decision has a significant impact on the city's revenue and have telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request further consideration. (Reported in yesterday's newspaper). According to the person in charge of the Finance Bureau, the new tax law with various changes, especially the vehicle license tax, differs greatly from the city's current method. Once implemented, the city's tax revenue will be even more unimaginable. Therefore, Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, went to the capital yesterday to personally consult with the relevant central authorities for an explanation and request a reconsideration. How to handle the city's future tax revenue will be decided after Director Gu returns to Shanghai.

[Another report] The Shanghai Commercial Association of Cigarettes, Soaps, Candles, and Matches has reported that both wholesalers and retailers have meager profits. Moreover, they are unbearable under the pressure of high-interest loans. The number of forced closures is increasing daily. However, if profits are increased and prices are raised, it will be difficult to compete with general cigarette vendors, creating a dilemma of raising or lowering prices. Currently, the profit margin for wholesalers who distribute goods from factories to retailers is less than 0.5%. If the business tax is calculated based on the total business volume at 1.5%, plus stamp tax and loan interest, there will be no profit, and losses will be incurred. Therefore, the association submitted a request to the Municipal Council yesterday to forward it to the relevant authorities, requesting a simplified method for levying business tax on cigarette merchants. It is learned that the association is scheduled to submit it to the Finance Committee today for discussion.

### Three Tax Issues to be Discussed by the Municipal Council Today

At the first meeting of the Municipal Council, the entertainment tax rate in this city was approved to be increased by 50%, and the Finance Bureau was requested to implement it accordingly. Various relevant entertainment groups repeatedly requested a reduction to 40%, but this was not allowed. After one month of collection by the Finance Bureau, it was felt that in the current situation of economic depression in all industries, the entertainment industry is also depressed and unable to bear the 50% tax. In order to consider the difficulties of the people, the Finance Bureau plans to temporarily reduce the tax rate to 40% to show consideration. A special submission has been made to the Municipal Council for approval. It is learned that the Municipal Council has submitted it to the Finance Committee for discussion and decision at its fifth meeting today. It is also learned that the matters to be discussed by the committee today include adjusting the slaughter tax rate, reducing the profit tax of pig farmers, and requesting the allocation of part of the Japanese reparations and enemy and puppet materials to carry out construction projects in this city.

### Military Tribunal to Try Japanese War Criminal Yuta Toyo Today

[Report from our newspaper] Yuta Toyo, a Japanese war criminal arrested on suspicion of leading espionage activities, has been detained for a long time since being sent to the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal. During this period, someone attempted to bail him out, but failed. It is learned that the military tribunal recently received an order from the Ministry of National Defense, instructing it to report on the investigation of the suspect. Therefore, it has been scheduled to hold a court hearing this morning to interrogate the suspect.

### Post Office Saves Manpower by Simplifying Procedures and Adding Agencies

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Post Office recently received an order from the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications to carry out staff reductions. As the post office's affairs are quite complicated, there is a feeling that there is no way to start reducing staff. However, the instructions from the Ministry must be followed, and the post office's finances are also very tight. It is learned that in order to reduce the number of staff, the post office plans to start from the following points: 1. Simplify procedures, 2. Increase agencies, 3. Utilize machines. Within this year, the post office plans to add 100 agencies in various districts to handle the consignment of postal millet and the collection of registered mail. At the same time, it will use machine bicycles to collect mail and specially make mailboxes for sale to the public to facilitate postal delivery.

The population of this city has doubled compared to before the war, and the postal service has also become more complicated than before the war. Airmail has increased sevenfold compared to before the war, express mail has increased fivefold, and registered mail has increased twofold. However, the number of staff at the Shanghai Post Office is still less than before the war. The post office receives 300,000 letters daily and delivers 700,000 letters daily. The number of transit letters is about 260,000 daily.

### Xiao Jianqing and Xiao Langping Sentenced; Yang Zhenyuan and Others Declared Not Guilty

[Report from our newspaper] Xiao Jianqing, 38 years old, from Zhongshan County, was accused of serving as the editor-in-chief of the puppet Zhonghua Daily Pictorial, the executive director of the Propaganda Section of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters of the puppet Chinese Nationalist Party, and the director of the office of the Chongming Special District Public Office. He also co-founded Wenhai Monthly and Bi-Monthly Comics with the traitor Pang Chiping, Director of the Business Department of the Puppet Propaganda Department, specializing in enemy propaganda through text and illustrations. Yesterday, the High Court sentenced him to three years of imprisonment. His brother, Xiao Langping, served as an assistant editor of the Puppet Youth Pictorial and an editor of the Puppet Zhonghua Pictorial. He was also sentenced to two years and six months. Yang Zhenyuan, Cui Zhongtai, Xu Teng, the captain of the Hongkou Puppet Navy Baojia Youth Corps, and Zai Peiqin, the captain of the squadron, who were accused of serving as reporters for the Puppet Youth Pictorial, were found not guilty after investigation by the High Court.

### Zhu Yicai on Trial

Zhu Yicai, 64 years old, from Wuxi, is the chairman of the Yangzhou Zhenyang Electric Company. After the victory, he was reported, accusing Zhu of cooperating with the enemy after the fall of Yangzhou, reusing Japanese nationals Sanben and several ronin, and selling more than 200 tons of steel to the enemy Xinye Company. In addition, he also served as a supervisor of the enemy Central China Aviation Co., Ltd. The defendant Wu Ren once served as a supervisor of the project and stated that after the fall of Yangzhou, the Zhenyang Company was not taken over by the Japanese, but was still handled by the Chinese, which was no different from before the war. Sanben was a section chief in the company and was only responsible for purchasing coal. The sale of scrap iron was handled by manager Zhu Hanfu, and the defendant did not know the details. Moreover, the Xin Aluminum Factory was not opened by the Japanese. The case was retried yesterday afternoon, and Zhu Hanfu and Yin Baoshu, the Chinese merchant who purchased the scrap iron, were brought to court. After questioning, the court ordered a postponement for further interrogation.

### Liu Qinyi and Others' Cases Concluded; Zhang Enlin and Others Prosecuted

On the same day, the cases of Liu Qinyi, Chen Mingxiang, He Tengjiu, He Fada, and others suspected of being traitors were concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 30th of this month. The case of Zhang Shuchun was scheduled to be announced on December 2nd.

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Council previously recommended to the Municipal Government: (1) Strictly implement the Habeas Corpus Act, (2) Strictly implement the bail system, (3) Strictly implement the compensation system for wrongful imprisonments. After the Municipal Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions, the Executive Yuan issued an instruction yesterday stating: "Regarding the proposal to strictly implement the Habeas Corpus Act in order to emphasize human rights and maintain discipline, a circular has been issued for compliance. Regarding the recommendation to the Judicial Administration Department to strictly implement the bail system, the Judicial Administration Department has been instructed. As for the recommendation to the government to strictly implement the compensation system for wrongful imprisonments, there are concerns about bearing the huge amount of compensation due to the country's current financial difficulties. In addition to instructing the Judicial Administration Department to carefully select judicial officials and strictly examine them, the matter will be temporarily postponed." After receiving the order, the Municipal Government sent a letter to the Municipal Council and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for reference and issued orders to the Police Bureau for information.

### Many Troubles at Jing'an Temple; Disputes over Temple Property; Rejection of Six Roots' Takeover; Struggle Not Easily Ended

[Report from our newspaper] Jing'an Temple seems to have always been fraught with troubles, perhaps related to the enormous temple property! These two days have seen another good show of takeover, which has not yet ended. The matter has been brewing for a long time. Recently, on the evening of the 23rd, Six Roots invited reporters from various newspapers in the city to the Jinghua Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. During the dinner, he reported that he would return to serve as the abbot of Jing'an Temple, rectify the temple rules, and liquidate the temple property.

The next day, the newspapers featured "Public Announcement by Jing'an Temple Dharma Protectors and Patrons Supporting Monk Six Roots' Return to the Temple to Resume His Position," "Public Announcement by Shanghai Buddhist Tonsure Sect Temples," and "Public Announcement by Merchants Near Jing'an Temple." The content of the public announcements all requested Monk Six Roots to return to the temple to resume his position.

At about 1:00 PM on this day, more than a dozen Dharma protectors and patrons accompanied Monk Six Roots to Jing'an Temple to resume his position, but they were rejected by the monks of Jing'an Temple and representatives of the Shanghai Branch of the Buddhist Association. After a disturbance lasting more than four hours, Six Roots and others returned.

Monks Bai Sheng and Yu Mei told reporters that Six Roots had no reason to try to take over the temple property. They unanimously stated that Six Roots' return to serve as the abbot of Jing'an Temple was completely illegal, and he was not qualified to serve as the abbot of Jing'an Temple.

However, will Monk Six Roots simply give up like this? Can the struggle for Jing'an Temple be ended so easily? The answer is probably a "no." In fact, what fame and fortune are there for monks to pursue? This is truly a kind of worldly irony.

### Beneficiaries of Emergency Aid; Finger Severed by Steel Knife; Malaria Rages

Young Zhu, 34 years old, from Luodian, usually makes a meager profit by transporting passengers and goods between various towns and villages by bicycle. Yesterday morning, he came to Shanghai by bicycle. When he passed near Xujiahui Town, due to traffic congestion, young Zhu panicked and overturned his bicycle onto a tiger cart. The cart was full of paper-cutting steel knives, which were extremely sharp, causing young Zhu's right index finger to be cut off immediately. Blood flowed like a river, and he fainted immediately. At that time, a passerby, Mr. Wang, passed by and saw the situation. He hired a pedicab to accompany him to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment! According to the doctor, the injured person needs surgery to remove the severed finger completely. Young Zhu, being a poor man, cannot afford the medical expenses. He applied for the emergency aid organized by this newspaper and has been approved. The girl Wang Qingfang, 6 years old, resides at her uncle's house at No. 148 Kangping Road. Her parents both work as helpers in this city and make a meager income, barely enough to make ends meet. At the beginning of this month, Qingfang contracted severe malaria. Due to a lack of funds for treatment, her condition worsened day by day. She suffered from alternating chills and fever and extreme pain. Her old edema also broke out at the same time, making the situation even more critical. After her family sent her to the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital on Xujiahui Road for treatment, she gradually recovered. She applied for the emergency aid of this newspaper and has been approved for 130,000 yuan.

### Compliance with Negotiated Prices; Oil Market Resumes Yesterday; Factories Continue to Allocate 1,300 Dan; Pudong District Should Pay and Pick Up Goods Today

[Report from our newspaper] The oil market was suspended for several days. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the oil and grain industry delegated Zhang Chao to submit a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to resume oil market transactions. Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, forwarded the request to Mayor Wu and obtained his approval. However, there were conditions: the market transaction price must be within the negotiated price and must not engage in black market trading. In addition, the names of customers and brokers for future oil market transactions must be filled out on triplicate forms and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau on a daily basis for verification. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered edible oil vendors, retailers, middlemen, and brokers to send five or six representatives each to supervise transactions in the market. The oil market officially resumed yesterday. 256 dan of Qingdao raw oil were opened at 135,000 yuan per dan. A batch of Jipu barrel raw oil (including barrels) one-week futures was opened at 145,000 yuan per dan. The transactions were able to comply with the negotiated price regulations, and the situation was considered good.

Yesterday, various private factories continued to allocate 500 dan of oil, including 80 dan of Dayouyu soybean oil, 100 dan of Dachang new soybean oil, 80 dan of Dade new rapeseed oil, 60 dan of Shunyu soybean oil, 80 dan of Changde soybean oil, 20 dan of sesame oil, 40 dan of Dasheng sesame oil, and 40 dan of Weimin sesame oil. Among them, 100 dan of sesame oil were returned to the factories because the need for sesame oil in this city was less. The shortfall will be made up tomorrow. The oil allocated yesterday was allocated to 146 retail stores in Pudong, and each store can be allocated 3.5 dan. Retail stores in the Pudong district can go to the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office today to pay for the goods and facilitate delivery.

In addition to allocating soybean, rapeseed, and sesame oil, various factories also allocated 800 dan of Qing oil yesterday, which has been properly allocated by the Joint Allocation Office.

According to people in the oil industry, the market price of Qingdao raw oil has been trending downward in recent days, with each dan being 108,000 yuan. The price upon arrival in Shanghai should be within 140,000 yuan, with the hope of further decline. Zhaoshangju's Haihuanghai and Shouxing vessels will transport the oil in batches from Qingdao. In addition to the China Edible Oil Company having a large shipment, transportation companies will also have several thousand barrels arriving one after another.

### Although the Central Bank is Trying to Stabilize the Gold Market, the Rise is Still Fierce; Speculative Atmosphere for US Dollars is Lighter

The buying frenzy was even stronger yesterday, and the Central Bank was once again in a difficult battle. It opened at 2.63 million in the morning. With pressure from the Central Bank, sellers appeared intermittently during the week. It once fell to 2.61 million, but was chased by buyers and gradually rebounded. The Central Bank allocated 300 bars at a price of 2.6475 million. After 10:00 AM, those who exchanged stocks for gold came to participate, and the rise became even greater, breaking through the 2.7 million mark. The Central Bank suppressed it again at high prices, and it slightly returned to around 2.675 million near noon. It continued to rise in the afternoon, hovering between 2.68 million and 2.69 million. As a result, it rose by another 30,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry was raised to 284,000. Silver ingots were flat, while silver dollars were slightly better. The shadow interest rate remained at around 12 to 15%.

The rise in foreign currency prices was not as good as the price of gold. The shadow market for US dollars opened at 4,800 yuan to 4,830 yuan in the morning. After opening, the buying price once fell to 4,780 yuan. Later, the surge in the gold market boosted buying sentiment, but the speculative atmosphere was lighter. Although it rose, transactions were not widespread. Therefore, 4,900 yuan was the highest price. At noon, it struggled between 4,820 yuan and 4,870 yuan. In the afternoon, there were slightly fewer buyers, and the price rose slightly again to between 4,830 yuan and 4,880 yuan. As a result, it was slightly better by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars were also passively raised by 10 yuan. The US exchange rate remained the same, while the Hong Kong exchange rate rose slightly to between 940 yuan and 950 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was between 1,130 yuan and 1,150 yuan, and the British exchange rate was between 1,500 yuan and 1,520 yuan.

### Bond Market Situation Mediocre

The bond market was extremely mediocre yesterday. Tongbing opened at 1,380 yuan in the morning, and the low price fell below 1,350 yuan. Two major players on the 5th floor were selling, but a certain player on the 8th floor and major players such as Fuyuan were still accepting, and it rebounded to above 1,400 yuan at the close. As a result, it rose slightly by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Jiayi and Jiyi were flat, while Tongding fell by 50 yuan and Tongwu fell by 20 yuan.

### Tea Market Transactions Sluggish

In the Zhuang tea market, some cargo owners adjusting capital are still selling off their goods, while buyers continue to seize the opportunity to suppress prices. Transactions are quite sluggish, and prices are evidently flat or declining. According to industry insiders, although there is demand for Chinese tea in foreign countries, the disparity in overseas selling prices makes it difficult to promote sales. At the same time, the scarcity of ships also makes exports doubly difficult. As for domestic sales, they are all narrow and the situation is ordinary and unremarkable.

### Tea Merchants Hold Meeting

The Shanghai Tea Export Association of the China Tea Industry Association, and representatives of tea petitioners from various provinces, including Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian, held a joint meeting at the China Tea Industry Association yesterday at 3:00 PM. Shou Jingwei was elected as chairman. Shou gave a speech, stating that tea merchants in Shanghai and tea farmers in various provinces are all affected by high-interest loans and are in dire straits. Therefore, the issues to be discussed today are: (1) the tea purchase problem for this year, and (2) the fundamental problem of tea export trade. Subsequently, the representatives firmly requested Shou to serve as the head of the petition delegation, and drafted measures for tea purchases this year. It is expected that after discussion at a meeting to be held at the China Tea Industry Association at 3:00 PM on the 28th of this month (Thursday), the date for the delegation's trip to Beijing can be determined.

### Silk Mills Appeal for Relief, Costs Double Selling Prices

More than fifty silk reeling mills in this city are suffering heavy losses. In addition to making an urgent appeal to the authorities, they are also requesting relevant agencies such as the China Trust Bureau and the China Silk Corporation to raise the purchase price of raw silk. According to the cost calculation for autumn cocoon reeling, each dan of raw silk reaches 6,395,000 yuan, plus interest on expenses (silk merchants need to invest 20 million yuan for every 100 million yuan loan to purchase cocoons and produce silk, and the monthly interest reaches 3 million yuan), each dan costs around 7 million yuan. Therefore, the industry hopes to raise the price to 7 million yuan per dan, a difference of almost double the current purchase price of 3.8 million yuan per dan. It is said that if the price is not raised, all operations will be stranded within the year, and there is no hope of starting work next year. According to the person in charge of the China Silk Corporation, the current stock of cocoons can only be reeled until the end of the lunar year, and there is no supply for next spring.

### Cloth Market Firm

The demand for cotton cloth from various parties is flat, and transactions are idle. The transaction prices of various grades of grey cloth and serge are similar to those of last weekend. Among them, old stock serge, such as "Four Gentlemen," "Yuan Gong Ni," "Jumping Carp," and "Electric Light Twill," are in great demand on this street, and the market price has risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The grey cloth market is extremely mediocre. The total transaction volume is 92,000 yuan for "Dragon Head" fine cloth, 91,000 yuan for "Five Blessings" fine cloth, and 89,000 yuan for "Colored Ball" fine cloth.

### Importation Requires Permit, Customs Announces Implementation

[Our Newspaper News] The Jianghai Customs officially announced yesterday that the import of all goods must be handled with a permit. The original announcement stated: "Regarding the interim measures for import and export trade, this customs office has previously issued Announcement No. 92 and 93 on November 17th and 18th of this year. Now, we have received a telegram from the Acting Inspector General of Customs, with the order from the Customs Administration, forwarding Announcement No. 1 of the Import Interim Management Committee regarding the application procedures for imported goods, instructing all customs offices to comply, and instructing that upon receipt of the announcement, the import of all goods must be handled with a permit." The original announcement was forwarded, instructing compliance from the date of receipt of the telegram. Therefore, we must comply. In addition to the fact that the original announcement has been published in the newspaper by the Import Interim Management Committee, we will not attach a copy separately. We hereby issue this announcement to inform all Chinese and foreign merchants.

### Viscose Allocation Price Unchanged, Application Deadline for Next Month is Tomorrow

Yesterday, the China Trust Bureau's twelfth allocation of viscose rayon maintained the original price for all colors. However, there were more patterned colors allocated. "Great Wealth" was 2.77 million yuan per case, "High Mountain" was 2.75 million yuan per case, and the price of "Early Sun" was the same as "High Mountain." In addition to the allocation to the electrical machinery industry, the applications for the monthly consumption of the weaving, dyeing, and knitting industries have all been approved. Seventy-five weaving companies were allocated 123 cases, and 105 dyeing companies were allocated 187 cases. The knitting and electrical machinery industries will be allocated after the purchase volume for this period is submitted to the bureau. The bureau stated that since all manufacturers have been allocated, and there is no need in the market, the allocation of viscose rayon to viscose merchants will be temporarily suspended. The bureau requires each industry to submit a list of the quantity needed for December before the 27th of this month for verification.

### Fine Yarn Still Has Black Market, Outport Allocation to be Discussed This Thursday

[Our Newspaper News] According to Liu Wenteng, director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Commission, the dyeing and weaving industries in Changzhou, Wuxian, Wuxi, and Jiangyin have recently submitted requests for yarn allocation. According to the report from the Changzhou Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, there are a total of 69 dyeing and weaving factories in the area, with a total of 4,423 looms, requiring a total of 8,539 pieces of yarn of various counts per month. However, according to the investigation by the Changzhou Three People's Principles Youth League branch, there are 91 dyeing and weaving factories, with a total of 3,500 looms, requiring a total of 6,000 pieces of yarn of various counts per month. According to the report from the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce, there are 42 cloth factories, and according to the current operating situation, they need 150 pieces of 42-count yarn, 150 pieces of 32-count yarn, and 400 pieces of 20-count yarn per month. Wuxi and Jiangyin only submitted requests for yarn allocation, without providing the required quantity. The proposals will be made into motions and submitted for discussion at the regular meeting of the Textile Control Commission this Thursday.

Yesterday, the yarn market became more active because the Shenxin Yarn Factory had 100 pieces each of 16-count Guangming and 10-count Shuangxi yarns, which were specially allocated to yarn trading companies. In addition, the amount sold by Fangjian Yongan last week made the chips on the market slightly more abundant, and the transaction volume increased compared to last week. All transactions are carried out in accordance with the new regulations of the authorities, and both parties immediately report to the association, which forwards them to the Textile Control Commission. However, those who generally seek spot goods for yarn threads above 20 counts still have to find ways to obtain them through the black market.

### Textile Control Authorities Talk About Yarn Prices: Raw Cotton Prices Have Not Risen, Wages Have Increased Slightly

[Our Newspaper News] When the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a meeting a few days ago, it stated that the price of raw cotton had changed, and the production cost of cotton yarn had increased. It was proposed that the Price Negotiation Committee re-adjust the previously negotiated price of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count yarn. The reporter consulted the person in charge of the Textile Control Commission on this matter. It was answered that the Textile Control Commission had not yet received the Cotton Spinning Association's request to adjust the negotiated price of cotton yarn. If there is a request in the future, the Textile Control Commission will consider it. However, it was reported that when the negotiated price of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count yarn was set, the CIF price of American cotton in Shanghai was 36 cents per pound. At present, the CIF price of American cotton in Shanghai is 32 cents per pound. Therefore, in terms of the cost of raw cotton, it has decreased compared to before. However, the cost of living for workers is indeed slightly higher than the standard when the price of 1.75 million yuan was agreed upon.

### A Glimpse of North-South Freight

### Importers Request Extension of Registration Period by One Week

After the establishment of the Import Management Committee, the registration period for importers was only two weeks. It is now known that the Import and Export Commerce Association, based on the request of its member firms that the registration period is too short and difficult to complete in time, transferred a letter to the Import Management Committee yesterday requesting an extension of one week.

### One-Fifth of Leather Merchants Have Ceased Operations

The Leather and Raw Materials Industry Association in this city currently has about 250 members, divided into shop owners and household owners. According to relevant people in the association, due to the dumping of foreign goods and the oppression of high-interest loans, business is becoming increasingly sluggish, and both retail and wholesale sales are stagnant. In recent months, the number of those who have voluntarily ceased operations has reached more than 50 so far.

### Caustic Soda Plunges, Hong Kong Supply Arrives

Large quantities of various raw materials have arrived at the port. American goods such as styrene, beeswax, rosin, soda ash, caustic soda, and zinc oxide have begun to be unloaded yesterday. These orders were placed with the United States in April and May.

According to its import company, the first batch of caustic soda shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai will arrive in three or four days, and the volume arriving within the year could reach around 5,000 barrels.

Yesterday's market price fell sharply because 600 new barrels of Hong Kong goods were available for sale on the market, priced at only 1.4 million yuan per barrel, while buyers bid 1.2 million yuan, a drop of 1 million yuan per barrel compared to Saturday.

### War Losses Too Severe, Insufficient Power, Wuxi's Industry Not Easy to Restore to Former Glory

[Our Newspaper News] Qian Zhonghan, the executive director of the Wuxi Four District Flour Industry Association, recently returned to Shanghai from Wuxi. According to his report, Wuxi's industry has not yet recovered its former glory due to war losses and insufficient power. Taking the most prosperous yarn factory as an example, the production volume is only half of that before the war. As for the flour industry, the Maofu factory, which was large-scale before the war, was burned down during the war, and the Jiuyan factory has not yet resumed work. In terms of the number of factories that have started work, it accounts for 60% of all flour factories; however, due to insufficient power, they only operate for 12 hours a day and take a break every other day, so the production volume cannot be compared with the past. As for silk factories, the three largest factories, Yongtai, Huaxin, and Dingchang, have all failed to resume work due to war losses, and the production volume is less than half of that before the war. Insufficient power is the main reason why Wuxi's industry cannot recover. If the industry in the area is to develop, the power supply needs to be increased three times. The machinery of the local power plant was damaged during the war, and the supply of coal is insufficient, so it cannot meet the needs of the local industry.

### Multi-Head Organization Powerless, Chinese Stocks Still One-Sidedly Down

Chinese stocks were still one-sidedly down yesterday. The so-called multi-head organization was powerless and suddenly collapsed. The sharp decline was even more severe near noon. Except for the slight increase in Xianxin at the opening, the rest suddenly appeared weak. After the opening, panic set in, and many closed out their positions and were unable to support themselves. Although there was a slight rebound, it was only temporary. Then, there was a rush to short sell. With little supply and deep demand, the market outside was extremely eager, which caused the multiple heads of a certain company to be cut off, and people became even more panic. Although the sellers were scattered, the buyers were timid, and the source of supply was continuous. Floating more temporarily sold near noon, and new lows were seen near noon. The afternoon closing rebounded slightly. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongshen, Xianxin, and Jingfu fell by half a percent, and Meiya, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by about 10%. Although the Chinese stock market did not fall too much, the unpopular stocks Xinya, Yonggong, and Nei Yi each fell by about 10%. Zhongfang, Lian'an, Cement, and Jinglun were flat, and the rest fell slightly. In the futures market, Yongshen, Xianxin, and Jingfu fell by half a percent, Huashan fell slightly by less than half a percent, Meiya, Qinxing, and Xinguang fell by 10%, and Yonggong went short at the opening. In the afternoon, there were still some big traders on the market, but the market was dominated by short sellers. The "38" stock was on sale, and finally, another tragic plunge occurred. Now, Yongshen has broken the 500 yuan mark, and the futures Meiya has tragically fallen to the limit down. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongshen and Xianxin fell by 8%, and Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by about 15%. Huashan fell by half a percent. Among the unpopular stocks, except for Wuhe, Lian'an, Youfang, and Jinglun, which were flat, the rest fell by 15% to 10%. In the futures market, Yongshen, Xianxin, Jingfu, and Qinxing fell by 10%, Meiya and Xinguang fell by 15%, and Huashan also fell by half a percent. All stocks outside the market fell sharply.

Foreign stocks showed a slight decline yesterday. After a high opening, the market saw consolidation, and the market situation was still flat. Small stocks had mixed fortunes. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yisha, Yinglian, Ye Guang, Qia Pi fell slightly, the steel industry fell by slightly less than half a percent, the paper and shipping industries rose slightly, and Jardine Matheson was flat.

### Japonica and Indica Still Diverge, Oil and Grain Trends Weak

The rice market arrived with about 17,000 shi of rice from the north and south, mainly japonica rice. Southern japonica fell by 2,000 yuan, and northern japonica fell by 1,000 yuan. Sales were still sluggish. Baiyuan and Yinyuan both fell by slightly more than 1,000 yuan. However, the market was brisk due to the shortage of Yangxian and Buxian rice. Japonica and indica rice diverged. Duxian rice was flat and weak. Flour prices continued to decline step by step. Miscellaneous brands of flour continued to fall by a small amount of 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat remained flat. The oil market was allocated a total of 800 dan, and the trend was soft. Crude oil and soybean oil fell by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and sesame oil fell by a small amount of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Bean cake from Xinghua was slightly acquired, and the market situation was stable. Bran was light and dull. The sales of soybeans from various ports became sluggish, and oil factories were also sluggish, with prices falling by a small amount of 300 to 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Sesame downstream, raw kernels from Nanyang remained unchanged, and sales were also sluggish, with prices falling again by a small amount of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Red grain fell by a small amount of 1,000 yuan.

### Sino-American Industrial Corporation Emphasizes Industry and Water Conservancy Uses Import Profits to Make Up for Export Losses and Builds Various Public Utilities in Chengdu

[Our Newspaper News] A key person in charge of Sino-American Industrial Corporation told reporters: "The company is a business jointly organized by Chinese and American people. It hopes to serve as a bridge between the two countries so that American manpower and materials can be used for the reconstruction and construction of our country." The company's current capital is set at 3 billion yuan in national currency. In terms of organization and personnel, the board of directors has 25 directors, with Mr. Li Mingyang, a Chinese national, as the chairman, and the famous Flying Tiger General Chennault as the managing director; there are nine supervisors, and under the board of directors, there is a design committee. The rest of the personnel configuration is: one general manager, one deputy general manager, and three departments: general affairs, accounting, and business, all of which are headed by Chinese nationals.

The department also has an industrial investment department that designs and implements various industrial investments. The head office of the Sino-American Industrial Corporation is located in this city, and branches are located in major ports. The branches in Changsha and Hankou have now been established, and the ones in Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Guilin are under preparation. The principle of economy is adopted in the employment of people, and efforts are made to save expenses. Therefore, the head office currently has only more than 20 people, and the branch offices have only about 10 people. The company is currently going through registration procedures with the government, and business is being actively prepared. Everything is done in a "do before you say" and "steady and steady" manner. The company will publicly meet the public when the business is officially launched.

The goal of the Sino-American Industrial Corporation is to use the profits from imports to subsidize the losses from exports. Among the imported goods, emphasis is placed on large and small hardware, western medicines, and agricultural and industrial machinery. The exported products focus on tung oil, hog bristles, etc. The current business that has been promoted is the introduction by the company to enable the Chengdu Municipal Government to sign contracts with two major American companies, whereby the latter will provide capital and technology to build Chengdu's tap water, electricity, telephone, public transportation, sewerage, and hospital bed equipment, six major projects. The total amount of project funding is more than 10 billion yuan in legal currency. The materials and services provided by the American side are regarded as loans rather than investments, which will be repaid by the Sichuan Provincial Government within five to ten years, with an interest rate of 4% to 6%. The principles have been agreed upon by both parties. If this move is successful, the company plans to introduce American resources and technology to rebuild the cities in our country that were most severely damaged during the war, such as Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, and Liuzhou.

The Sino-American Industrial Corporation also intends to contribute to the current housing shortage problem. However, the scope of its efforts is not willing to be limited to coastal cities and plans to popularize it in the interior and rural areas. It is currently in contact with an American company to move a mobile home manufacturing plant to our country, use domestic timber, and manufacture locally, so as to save the uneconomical transportation. The machinery of this manufacturing plant can produce 15,000 square feet of wood panels per day for construction purposes. The company has sent someone to study its performance and hopes to close the deal soon.

The company's long-term plan focuses entirely on the construction of industry and water conservancy. In the industrial sector, it hopes to build a large-scale yarn factory in Hankou and establish a large oil refinery in the central China region to refine tung oil, making it easier to export. In the water conservancy sector, it has even greater ambitions. It is currently in contact to order 500 to 1,000 water pumps, and then select appropriate areas to establish rural service stations to irrigate for farmers. It is estimated that each irrigation machine can irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land, and 1,000 machines can irrigate 1 million mu of land, which will definitely benefit people's livelihoods. The person in charge of the company repeatedly emphasized that it is willing to introduce the capital and technology of friendly countries in the position of a private enterprise to assist the government in carrying out construction work.

### Professors at Tangshan Institute of Technology Strike, Students Out of School for Half a Year, Idle, Lacking Coal and Rice, Anxious All Day Long

[Special Dispatch from Tangshan] The professors at Tangshan Institute of Technology are striking because their salaries are meager and they cannot maintain their livelihoods. This semester, they asked the education authorities to change the salary structure to the level of professors in the Tianjin-Beijing area. Since their request was not met, they are still on strike. The weather is getting colder, and there is no coal or rice. The students have been out of school for half a year and are about to freeze and starve. They are very anxious. When meeting with the reporter, they showed a petition, which is transcribed below for the authorities: "The students of Tangshan Institute of Technology, who have been idle for half a year, are still not attending classes due to the strike by the professors who asked the authorities to issue salaries at the level of the Tianjin-Beijing area. They can only stare blankly at the desks arranged in the classroom and the repaired water heaters. The reply from the Ministry of Education is delayed. Some people say: Perhaps the Ministry of Education is busy holding the National Congress these days and has no time to pay attention to the strike by the professors of Tangshan Institute of Technology. Then, when will we be able to attend classes? It is also pitiful to say that the salary of a professor is no more than 300,000 yuan at most, while the prices in Tangshan, taking rice as an example, are 800 yuan per catty, and that is still substandard goods. In Shanghai, one liter is only 600 yuan. Other items are all shipped from Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and other places. Tangshan, except for coal production, has nothing else. Recently, due to the unrest in the surrounding areas, grain prices are rising every day. Even coal is not easy to buy. This winter, the teachers and students of Tangshan Institute of Technology in the coal-producing area still have no coal to rely on. They cannot afford to buy it on the black market, and they cannot buy it on the official market. Although the weather this year has been particularly variable, and the cold god has arrived late, it is a strange omen of extreme cold. The shadow of hunger and cold has enveloped the teachers and students of Tangshan Institute of Technology. They were not killed by artillery fire during the war, but they will freeze and starve to death this year. It is really unexpected! I hope the Ministry of Education will have some compassion and solve the problem as soon as possible, so that the good time will not be spent in idleness, and the students will be anxious all day long!

### The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Formulates Regulations for Teachers Going Abroad

Introducing Services to Overseas Chinese Schools

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] In order to train and improve the quality of teachers for overseas Chinese education, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has successively held teacher training courses and overseas Chinese normal schools. Later, due to the impact of the war, most of them were not sent to serve overseas. Now, more than a year after the recovery, only more than half of the overseas Chinese schools in various places have been restored. Most of them have been unable to re-establish schools due to economic difficulties and lack of teachers. The quality of teachers employed in the schools that have been restored is also mostly low. Now, in order to send or introduce teachers to serve in overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools and facilitate management, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has specially formulated regulations for sending teachers abroad to serve. The regulations have been announced and implemented.

### There are 225 Middle Schools in This City Xie En'gao Reports at the City Government Memorial Week

Xie En'gao, director of the Secondary Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, reported on the general situation of secondary education in Shanghai in the past year at the City Government Memorial Week at 9:00 am yesterday, divided into three points: (1) Current situation: There are currently 225 secondary schools in this city, with a total of 619 classes in senior high schools and 24,377 students, and 1,079 classes in junior high schools and 52,199 students. Among the 225 schools, 21 are municipal, 201 are private, 2 are national, and 1 is provincial. Among the municipal middle schools, 16 are general middle schools with 10,047 students, 4 are normal schools with 625 students, and 1 is a vocational school with 132 students. In terms of quantity, municipal schools account for 9%, classes account for 16%, and students account for 15%. (2) Past facilities: After the restoration of this city, many of the original municipal middle schools were destroyed by war. Middle schools such as Wuben and Jingye were restored one after another, and six schools such as Gaoqiao, Zhenru, City West, Fuxing, Yangsi, and Luxing were established successively. Private schools were actively reorganized, registered, and inspected, and audited. The organization of the school board was improved, the schools were urged to establish economic audit committees, and the qualifications of teachers were verified, and the academic performance and student status were reviewed. These tasks must be continued next year. (3) Future guidelines: For the future development of secondary education, improving quality is the most important thing. Expanding existing schools and increasing classes will make management easier, and more vocational middle schools should be established to meet the needs of this city. In order to thoroughly transform the environment and coordinate with urban design, it is most ideal to use public land and move middle schools in the urban area to the suburbs and manage them in a centralized manner.

### Basketball Referee Monthly Meeting

Decision to Rectify Service Efficiency

The Shanghai Basketball Referees Association held a monthly meeting a few days ago, with more than 20 new and old members attending. Chairman Zhou Jiaqi presided over the meeting, discussing association affairs, rules, and refereeing methods. The meeting lasted for three hours before adjourning.

The association will find funds to tailor and distribute them in the near future. The distribution list is limited to current serving members. (3) Members who accept a refereeing appointment but fail to appear at the game hinder the progress of the match. In order to rectify the association's service spirit, a penalty method is stipulated and strictly enforced to encourage all members. If it is confirmed by all parties that the first offense is a non-attendance without justifiable cause, the member will be suspended from refereeing for one month. A second offense will result in a three-month suspension. A third offense will result in a one-year suspension. (The suspension period will be calculated from the date of the offense.)

### Women's Basketball Initially Uses Men's Rules, "Snow White" Women Unable to Withstand a Single Blow, "Black and White" Achieves a Great Victory Last Night, "Black and White" Men Suffer Defeat in a Fierce Battle Against "Giants"

The "Black and White" women's basketball team played their first game last night in Shanghai using men's rules. As expected, the "Snow White" team was unable to withstand a single blow, and "Black and White" won a great victory by a score of 35 to 10. The halftime score was 19 to 3. "Black and White" did whatever they wanted throughout the game. "Snow White" appeared inferior in running stamina and throwing ability, and could only submit to "Black and White." While the women's team won, the men's team suffered a defeat against the "Giants," 34 to 37. The difference was only three points. The halftime score was tied at 12 points each. The first half was very close. In the second half, the "Giants" scored sharply. "Black and White" bravely tried to catch up, but unfortunately, they fell short. The "Black and White" performance seemed to have improved.

"Black and White" Women's Team Does Whatever They Want

In the first game, the "Black and White" women's team faced "Snow White" again. It was the visiting team's first time using men's rules in Shanghai. Chen Baolin was the referee. "Black and White" started with Huang Rulan, Chen Yurun, Xiao Fanleng, Ouyang Meilan, and Wu Yuwu. "Snow White" responded with Zhang Xiuli, Wang Huilin, Ren Kuanping, Zhu Jiazhen, and Huang Ruyu. Chen Yurun of "Black and White" opened the scoring. Huang Rulan made a beautiful shot, and Yuwu tossed the ball in, scoring six consecutive points. "Snow White" was very unaccustomed to the men's rules and was at a loss. It wasn't until the score was 9 to 0 that Zhang Xiuli scored a basket. The first quarter ended with 15 to 2. When the second quarter began, "Snow White" only scored one point on a free throw by Huang Ruyu. The first half ended with 19 to 3, "Black and White" leading. After the break, "Black and White" made major substitutions. Chen Yurun scored twice, and Lu Shuhui made a basket. Wang Huilin of "Snow White" scored a long-range shot. "Black and White" led comfortably in the third quarter with a score of 26 to 7. The final quarter was still dominated by "Black and White." Zhang Xiuli of "Snow White" pulled back two points. When the regulation time expired, "Black and White" defeated "Snow White" again with a score of 35 to 10.

"Black and White" Men Fall Short

Following that, the "Black and White" men's team took the stage and faced Maoren. The visiting team had the American player Pete Gurney assisting them. "Black and White" also worked hard to reduce unnecessary substitutions, so the first half was quite exciting. The referees were Qu Honglu and Wu Xiaodi. "Black and White" started with Lin Ziyi, Ye Kexi, Xu Yinzhen, Shi Rongluo, and Zhuang Yufeng. The "Giants" started with the Saas King brothers, Yelong, Pete Gurney, and Qiang Dulai. A. Saas King opened the scoring. Ye Kexi scored one point on a free throw. After a long period of contention, the "Giants" won the first quarter by a small margin of 5 to 3. At the beginning of the second quarter, Lin Ziyi made a shot, tying the score. "Black and White" replaced Zhuang Yufeng with Captain Fu Yongxin. Pete Gurney made a one-handed basket, and Yongxin responded in kind. After Yelong threw the ball in, Shen Renshou replaced Lin Ziyi for "Black and White." "Black and White" chased hard, and the situation was very tense. The first half ended in a 12-12 tie.

After the break, Tao Bolinji scored on a free throw. Xu Yinzhen made a shot, and "Black and White" took the lead 14 to 13. Then the score became tied again at 16 each. At this time, "Black and White" frequently made substitutions. The "Giants" took advantage of this weakness. Pete Gurney scored five consecutive baskets in one breath. After the third quarter, "Black and White" had 19, and the "Giants" had 27. In the last quarter, Pete Gurney made more great contributions. The difference was ten points. "Black and White" then quickly chased directly. Ye Kexi, Lin Ziyi, Fu Yongxin, and others scored eight consecutive points, so the score became closer again. In the end, the score was 33 to 35, only one basket behind. The audience shouted encouragement, but Neff Knicks tossed the ball in under the basket, sealing the victory for the "Giants." By the time Ye Kexi scored on a free throw, time had run out. "Black and White" was defeated by the "Giants" with a score of 34 to 37.

### Reporter Basketball Team Wins Against Heart Team

The reporter basketball team played against the Heart Team at the City Gymnasium yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM. Yao Minghua was the referee. In the first quarter, the Heart Team led 13 to 9. In the second quarter, Tan Shiyuan of the Heart Team made every shot he took, and the reporter team fell further behind. Therefore, at the end of the first half, the Heart Team had an advantage of 33 to 21. After switching sides, the Heart Team didn't let up. Fang Moujian showed mercy, and the reporter team gradually caught up. After three quarters, the Heart Team had 41, and the reporter team had 37. In the last quarter, the reporter team was very active, and Cao Xizhen and Zhang Guoqiu scored many points. Therefore, at the end of the game, the reporter team was able to reverse the defeat and win against the Heart Team with a score of 55 to 46.

### Students Walking North Arrive in Peiping After Four Months of Long Trek, Enduring Great Hardship

[Our Peiping Dispatch on the 25th] More than 180 returning students from Normal College, Chaoyang, Yanjing and other schools arrived in Peiping on the evening of the 21st after a long trek of four months. According to their statement: They traveled via the Longhai Railway to Zhengzhou, then northward along the Pinghan Line, sometimes walking and sometimes taking the train. They passed through the communist areas several times, and some of the students were taken away by the communist army, and several were shot and wounded. When they arrived in Shijiazhuang, the northern section of the Pinghan Line was heavily damaged by the communist army, and they stayed in Shijiazhuang for forty days. Later, because there was no hope of restoring traffic, they walked north again. When they arrived south of Baoding, they encountered the communist army again, who persuaded them to go to the "North China United University" which had been relocated from Zhangjiakou to Hejian, Hebei, but they politely declined. Fortunately, they were not harassed and finally arrived in Baoding. After staying in Baoding for two days, they continued north and took a train on the Pinghan Road to Peiping at Gaobeidian. They suffered greatly along the way.

Regarding the doubts about the time limit for various clauses of Article 9 of the Provincial and County Public Office Candidate Examination Law, which stipulates that one shall not be allowed to take the Provincial and County Public Office Candidate Examination, the Examination Committee explained that, except for Clause 4 "Has been punished for embezzlement and private gain", which has been interpreted as being limited to those who have been subject to criminal punishment and has no time limit, and Clause 7 "Subject to the restrictions of Article 9 or Article 18 of the Nationality Law, and has not been lifted", the time limit of the original articles of the Nationality Law has been clearly stipulated. For the time limits of the remaining clauses, one shall be allowed to participate in the examination as soon as the relevant restrictions are lifted.

It has also been reported to the Examination Yuan for explanation, roughly as follows: "The investigation of embezzlement and private gain should be strictly restricted. Those who have been punished for embezzlement and private gain should never be allowed to take the public office candidate examination. As for Clauses 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, whenever the reasons for exclusion are eliminated, such as the arrest warrant has been revoked, the deprivation of civil rights has been restored, (the fixed-term deprivation has expired; the indefinite deprivation has been ordered to be restored), the public funds owed have been repaid, the declaration of prohibition of property management has been revoked, and the use of opium has been quit, the examination shall be allowed according to the interpretation", etc. The Examination Committee has sent separate letters to the provincial and municipal governments for verification.

### Prohibiting Unhealthy Folk Customs; Ministry of Interior Orders Implementation of Measures

The Ministry of Interior believes that unhealthy folk customs, such as worshiping divine power and superstition, foot-binding of women, raising maids, child brides, abortion, and infanticide, urgently need to be investigated, prohibited, and improved. It has formulated a "Measures for Investigating and Prohibiting Unhealthy Folk Customs." It is reported that in these measures, those who offer obscene gods to collect money, use spells and evil techniques to treat diseases, engage in other illegal activities under the guise of divine power and superstition, and form secret societies will be forced to change to other normal occupations. For women's foot-binding, raising maids, and child brides, measures such as advising liberation, terminating contracts, and compulsory liberation and termination of contracts will be adopted. For abortion and infanticide, measures such as propaganda and guidance, relief, and referral to judicial organs for handling will be used to investigate and prohibit them. The above measures have been approved by the Ministry of Interior, and the municipal government has been instructed to check and implement them. The municipal government has also issued orders to the relevant bureaus and offices to follow the original measures and jointly formulate and submit for approval detailed rules for the implementation of the investigation and prohibition of unhealthy folk customs in this city.

### Xi'an City Conditions: Price Hikes, Price Limits, Black Market Prices, and Pricelessness Amidst Turmoil

— Air Dispatch on the 17th, by Li Chi, our correspondent in Xi'an

This summer, in July, I wrote a dispatch for this newspaper saying that the prices in Chang'an were low and cheap. Therefore, although the war ended a year ago, the population has instead increased. At that time, the low prices in Xi'an ranked it in the fourth or fifth tier among the forty-odd provincial capitals and cities in the country. Unexpectedly, in just three or four months, within the last forty days, the price surge led by rice, wheat, and flour has been like a raging fire in a whirlwind, igniting the daily lives of 999 out of 1,000 citizens. The current food problem is clearly not due to a poor harvest or thin reserves, but rather due to manipulated sales prices and unreasonably soaring prices, as well as the need to improve allocation technology. The price of grain in Xi'an has now reached the pinnacle of the "pyramid," even three or four times higher than in other counties within the province. According to travelers coming west from the Longhai Railway in the east, the prices in Xi'an are even the highest along the line. After passing this "highest peak," the road slopes downward all the way westward. Recently, "single carriers" have also appeared between Xi'an and Baoji. Even if a person transports only three or five dou, they can make a profit. This is an unprecedented event on this railway line. The citizens of Xi'an have no choice but to turn to the black market for flour at more than 30,000 yuan per bag and rice at more than 70,000 yuan per zu, which are clearly higher than the prices in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Citizens have mixed opinions on the measures taken by the "price-limiting" authorities. However, everyone seems to want to ask: Since it is not impossible to crack down on this 1/1000th of "certain people" who are manipulating grain prices, then how long will their "special profits" continue?

Seasonal Fluctuations

I opened up various price records in Xi'an dating back to 1937. First, I set aside the general trend of gradually increasing prices due to inflation. Then, I removed the sudden factors caused by war (defeat and victory) and politics, as well as non-man-made factors such as floods and droughts. I quickly saw a seasonal fluctuation every year at the end of the lunar year. This phenomenon may exist everywhere, and the reason is very obvious. However, it is worth noting which month of each year this seasonal fluctuation begins. According to the normal years before the war, it generally started one month before the end of the lunar year. However, Xi'an has tended to start earlier and earlier in the last four or five years. It initially started in December of each new year, and gradually moved forward to November and October. This year, the "red lantern" of rising prices was raised as early as September. The current price surge will probably not subside and breathe a sigh of relief until after January next year.

Soaring Prices

Floating capital and hoarding are innately inseparable. However, this autumn, Xi'an's "funds" have been flowing in large quantities to the Yangtze River Delta region, thanks to the higher interbank lending rates in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The interbank lending rate here reached as high as 14% a week ago, which is a rare high interest rate in recent times. According to government announcements, the increase in currency in circulation since July has also been less than in the past. From this, it can be seen that the surge in prices this time cannot be attributed primarily to the amount of currency in circulation and floating capital. It may seem a bit hard to believe, but this time in Xi'an, the surge in grain prices has led this price surge. Some people are taking advantage of the aftermath of the new "335" foreign exchange rate and the rumors of another exchange rate adjustment in Shanghai in early September to make a big fuss! It is difficult for us to understand how the wheat and grain planted in the loess soil of Shaanxi can have such a close connection with the gold yuan on Wall Street in New York!

Flour Mill Production

Although this year's rice and wheat harvests were not very abundant, they were generally better than in an average year. Moreover, the grain tax has been reduced compared to last year. As for the output rate of flour mills in the city, according to expert Liu Youchen's statistics: the city's current monthly production capacity is at least 300,000 bags. (According to the police bureau's higher estimate, the monthly production capacity is 600,000 bags.) This figure is sufficient to meet the city's monthly consumption of 250,000 bags. (Because half of the citizens eat rice and local flour.) Although the flour mills have been suspending production from time to time since August under the pretext of no coal or without any pretext, like malaria, and there is no talk of increasing production with all their strength, in the early days of October, when the city began to experience a flour shortage, countless vehicles loaded with good flour were pulled out of the city into the countryside to "escape." Who says there is a real "shortage"? Or has everything been done to remedy the situation?

The fact is that the price of grain has risen by 100% in forty days! At the end of September, flour (per bag) sold for 16,000 yuan. By the time of the second evaluation in November, it was said to be 20,000 yuan, but the actual black market price exceeded 30,000 yuan. Rice (per dou, equivalent to 15 city catties) rose from 6,400 yuan to 13,000 yuan in the black market during the same period. Wheat (per dou) jumped from 3,000 yuan to 5,500 yuan. At that time, the official price flour also had some "decoration of the city." The twenty officially designated supply stations provided "civilian food" to the 2.5 million flour-eating citizens with two hundred purchase vouchers every day! In this way, do we still have reason to blame the rampant activities of the black market? Standing in long lines, standing for a day or three or five days, crowding in the pile, performing martial arts, and in the end, returning empty-handed and hungry. In such a situation, even though a certain newspaper said: "A supply station is unattended," another newspaper "XXX Newspaper" wrote on the same day that "those who are snapping up on the station are like starving people grabbing food!"

It is indeed "snapping up," and another kind of "snapping up" is in the near suburbs entering the city, by special "powerful people" to "snap up" any food entering the city, and the same is true for charcoal. Fifty days ago, a dan was sold for 20,000 yuan, and it is now sold for 60,000 yuan! If what is "snapped up" is their necessities of life, perhaps it is excusable, but this clearly belongs to "special rights and interests," "how can the law be forgiven"?

Afraid to Manage and Love to Manage

The authorities, of course, have taken measures to deal with the skyrocketing prices. The provincial government was ordered to start implementing price limits in September, and the Commodity Price Review Council was established in October. However, the first resolution of this council on the day of its establishment was to meet with the chairman of the provincial government to request the cancellation of the price limits! (Some people sarcastically said, "Would the Anti-Smoking Association dare to advocate the public sale of opium?" (Chairman Zhu of course could not accept this. On the contrary, he strengthened the price limit policy, and the prices of cotton yarn, meat, wages, etc. were also limited. During this period, citizens watched the price limits take effect and rejoiced. The rampant cotton yarn price was suppressed and became the most successful item in the price limit. Small and medium-sized cloth factories could now be allocated cotton yarn at the limited price. Although the slaughter of beef and mutton was once suspended, it could not be stopped after a few days and automatically resumed business. The photography industry increased the price by 100%, but the business declined sharply and instead "take one get one free," which is "laughable and non-laughable."…

Unfortunately, in early November, the price limit was finally overwhelmed by the price increase; and the current new price limit is threatened by "black market," "black prices," and "no goods, no prices." The Department of Finance and the Department of Food intend to allocate and sell food taxes, but the technology is still to be resolved.

Can the new price limit, which is entrusted to the lives of 500,000 citizens, continue to win against the "black price" and suppress the "price increase"? This is a test for the policymakers. The view that "it is not afraid of officials, but only afraid of management" is wrong. If officials can implement a price limit policy that takes the interests of the people as the premise, they will definitely be supported by the people, and the people love to be "managed" by them. However, there is a long and winding road from "afraid to manage" to "love to manage," which is also the watershed between the policymaking style from "old" to "new."

### Seven Days in Delhi

— Special Correspondent Zhou Xiangguang, Delhi Airmail, 13th

Delhi is the former capital of the Indian Empire and a historically significant place. It was the capital for various Indian dynasties. According to the Maha-Bharata, in ancient times, King Yudbister made it his capital around 4,000 years BC. Later, during the Muslim conquest of India, the Mughal Empire and its various dynasties all made it their capital. Subsequently, the British invaded India and temporarily established the capital in Calcutta. In 1911, King George V of England declared the capital would be moved from Calcutta to New Delhi, just two miles from Delhi. Today, New Delhi is not only a political center but also a transportation hub. Major railway lines from East, Northwest, Bombay, and Central India converge here. The air route between England and India also terminates here. Industrially, sectors like cotton weaving and steel are also highly developed. Therefore, for those coming to India, besides visiting the so-called three major districts of Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, the Indian capital is also a must-see destination.

Impressions of the Red Fort

This summer, after traveling in the Hyderabad Princely State, I took a train here to see the sights of the Indian capital. Initially, I stayed in a Muslim hostel in Punjab. Later, I found the food unsuitable and the facilities inadequate, so I moved to the Imperial Hotel, paying three shields of Indian currency per day for rent, with meals taken outside. This is considered inexpensive given the current cost of living in the Indian capital. On my second day in the Indian capital, I visited Mr. Mukherjee, an Indian friend, in the morning. After a half-hour conversation, he kindly sent his nephew, Mr. Kushal, to accompany me to the Office of the Chinese Commissioner. At that time, the original commissioner had been transferred back to China, and the office affairs were being handled by a first secretary. Mr. Lai Liangliang, a staff member of the office, graduated from the Central Political School and was a handsome young man. We had a very pleasant conversation. New Delhi is a new city built by the British in India, with trees lining the streets and modern urban planning. Often, a circular lawn is used as a starting point for several streets. Newcomers may find it difficult to navigate if they are walking to visit friends.

At 3:00 PM, I visited the Delhi Red Fort (ReoFort). This fort was originally built by Shah Jahan of the Mughal Dynasty (reigned from 1627 to 1658). The palace inside the fort is built of white marble and carved with intricate patterns, fully showcasing the art of Mughal architecture. The Diwan-I-has, Shah Jahan's hall of audience, is particularly majestic and magnificent. I recall that in the past, the Shah often sat on a peacock throne in this hall, holding court to judge cases or summoning his ministers to give instructions. This peacock throne was later seized by Nadir Shah, the Persian king who invaded India in 1793, but the palace hall remains intact. Whenever the sun sets, the gold ornaments on the marble ceiling and the jewels embedded in the square pillars reflect each other, creating a truly spectacular sight. A Persian couplet is inscribed on the wall: "If there is a paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here."

At this time, an American journalist arrived and we became very close. He even took a photo of me as a souvenir. The fort contains museums, Muslim chapels, and is garrisoned by British troops. Last autumn, the Indian National Army, led by S.C. Bose under the protection of Japan and Germany, established a provisional Indian government in Singapore. After the Allied victory in the war and the dissolution of the provisional government, these senior officers of the National Army were captured by the British army in India and charged with disloyalty to the British King and betrayal of the British Empire. The trial was held in this Red Fort. Mr. Nehru wore his lawyer's robes and appeared in court to defend them. As a result, the three leaders of the National Army were sentenced to death by the judges. However, when the verdict was sent to General Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, he immediately issued a pardon, releasing them without charge. Therefore, Auchinleck is highly respected by the Indian people for this. The Red Fort is 3,200 feet long, 1,800 feet wide, and about 100 feet high. The exterior is entirely built of red stone and is located by the river. Visitors must purchase a ticket for two annas each. However, due to the presence of the garrison, the Red Fort is only open from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily, not all day.

Jama Masjid

After visiting the Red Fort, I went to see the Jama Masjid. The mosque is located about half a mile from the Red Fort and is also built of red stone. The mosque is 200 feet long and 120 feet wide, with a central dome about 130 feet high. The mosque has three large gates, built on the east, north, and south sides. The east gate is the largest, and visitors enter from here. This mosque was also built by Shah Jahan. When the Muslim King resided in Delhi, he would go to the mosque to pray every Friday morning. After a brief visit, I went to the Chinese Commissioner's Office to attend a dinner hosted by Mr. Lai Liangliang. Mr. Lu Haoran, a student studying in India at public expense from the Central Political School, and Mr. Wu Jiangong, who had just arrived in India from Iran, were also present. We met after a long journey and talked very happily. The evening ended at 9:00 PM.

On the third morning, I drove to The Hindustan Times to meet Mr. Krinpandhi. He is the chief editorial writer of the newspaper. The newspaper was founded by Mr. D.K. Birla, an Indian industrialist, and Gandhi's son serves as the editor-in-chief. In reality, the younger Gandhi is often not present, and Mr. Krinpandhi is in charge. When I arrived at the newspaper office, Mr. Krinpandhi was unfortunately at home recuperating from an illness. However, a staff member of the newspaper sent someone to accompany me to his home. We were overjoyed to see each other, but unfortunately, he had not yet recovered his health and could not have a long conversation. In the afternoon, I visited the Lakshminarayan Temple. This temple was built in 1938 at a cost of more than 3 million shields of Indian currency. It was funded by Mr. K.K. Birla and is dedicated to the East Indian deities Lakshmi and Krishna. A Buddhist temple is also built next to it, housing a statue of Buddha. It is currently managed by the Ceylon Maha Bodhi Society. There are two great industrialists in India: Mr. Tata, whose former managers, Mr. Matthai, the current Minister of Supply of the Indian Provisional Government, and the Minister of Industry, Mr. Bapu, both held positions with Tata Company; and Mr. Birla, who is the economic backer of the National Congress Party. Birla has four brothers. His third brother, D.G. Birla, is involved in industrial organization, while Birla's eldest brother, J.K. Birla, is a religious believer who specializes in doing good deeds and giving alms. Birla regularly provides assistance to Chinese monks and nuns in India, either by giving money or providing goods. When I arrived at the temple, I met Birla's eldest brother, who was supervising the stone carving work. He was very happy to see me, but unfortunately, he only knew Indian languages and did not understand English. Therefore, we asked his personal secretary, Mr. Shen, to translate our conversation. He wanted me to meet his third brother, saying that General Chiang Kai-shek had stayed at his Calcutta residence during his visit to India in 1942, and General Chiang had invited his brother to visit China. At the same time, he strongly urged me to stay at his temple. I replied that I had to go to Central India the next day and could not stay here for long. I would definitely stay here for a while when I returned to listen to the Brahma bells and cultivate myself for a few days. He nodded in agreement and then bid me farewell. Afterwards, I visited Canaught Place, which is a market designated by the Indian government, similar to the New Market in Calcutta. All kinds of shops are concentrated here, as the other streets in New Delhi are residential areas and do not have shops.

Qutab Minar

Another historical site in the Indian capital is the Qutab Minar, one of India's great buildings, located about eleven miles southwest of Delhi. It is said that the tower was built before the Common Era, and was renovated by Anangpal in the eighth century, and rebuilt by the Chauhan Rajput in the twelfth century. There was no particular purpose for building this historical site at that time. However, according to historians, the Qutab Minar was actually built by PrithviRaj, the last emperor of the Hindu dynasty in India, for his beloved wife who wanted to look at the Junna River from a high place every day. In the twelfth century AD, Kutab-ud-Din renovated it, and at that time, the tower only had one floor. It was not until between 1210 and 1236 AD that Shams-Ud-Din Altamash built it into a five-story tower. In 1351-1358 AD, the fourth and fifth floors of the tower were rebuilt by Firoz Shah Tughlak, which is what it looks like today. The tower is 238 feet high, with a base diameter of 47 feet, and a top diameter of 4 feet. The first floor is 94 feet 11 inches high, the second floor is 50 feet 8 and a half inches, the third floor is 40 feet 3 and a half inches, the fourth floor is 25 feet 4 inches, and the fifth floor is 22 feet 4 inches. Each floor is built of red stone and inlaid with marble, and the patterns on the stone are very delicate and beautiful. Each floor is engraved with scriptures, such as the poem engraved on the first floor:

"If a person can build a tower to dedicate to the Heavenly Emperor, then the Heavenly Emperor will also build a house in the heavenly court in the same way to give to all people."

After the visit, I went with my Indian friend Kholsha to visit Mr. Soloo and was invited to dinner. His daughter, Shakuntala, who was recovering from illness, also came out to serve and chat for a while. I was very impressed by her gentleness. I returned to my residence to rest in the evening.

Delhi University On the fourth day, I planned to visit Delhi University. I first went to the Hindu College to meet Professor White De. Then I went to Delhi University with him for a tour. Professor White used to study at Serampore College, Calcutta University, and he and I were classmates at different times, so we felt regret that we had not met earlier. The Delhi University school building was originally the Governor's residence and is very exquisite. Through Professor White's introduction, I met Dr. Qureshi, the Director of Academic Affairs of the Faculty of Arts of the University. We had a very congenial conversation and he asked me about the situation of universities in China. I answered him one by one. The difference between the university systems of China and India is that India adopts the British system, while China imitates the United States. Therefore, in the current education system in India, there are ten years of primary school, four years of college, and two years of graduate school. In China, there are twelve years of primary and secondary school, and four years of university. Therefore, a Chinese university graduate is equivalent to an Indian graduate student, but the curriculum is slightly different. The president of Delhi University is usually held concurrently by the Indian Governor-General, Wavell. The current vice-president is Mr. Illo, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the British Empire. The actual responsibility for school affairs is borne by the three directors of the Faculties of Arts, Law, and Science. Delhi University is considered one of the best universities in India and is recognized by universities in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, so the level is quite high. The university currently has five colleges, including a women's college, a business school, and a law school. The other two colleges are liberal arts and science. At noon, I also visited Dr. Dodd, Director of the English Department of Delhi. He is already in his fifties and used to be the president of Ramjas College. He teaches Romantic literature in the graduate school of the university, but he is quite knowledgeable about Buddhism and has written a book on Buddhism in India in the fifth century, which is sold in the British and American publishing circles. He talked to me about Xuanzang and Chinese Buddhism. He knew that Xuanzang had translated more than 100 Buddhist scriptures, but he did not know their content. Since the Muslim invasion of India, some original Sanskrit classics have been lost. He is very interested in China. He once gave a lecture on "China and India" at Delhi University, which aroused great interest in most people. He just wants to visit China and is more willing to investigate the situation of Chinese Buddhism. I talked with him for several hours. Because I was invited by Mr. Varm, Secretary-General of the Education Bureau of Ajmer, and had to take the 8:00 PM train, I hurriedly said goodbye and returned to my residence to prepare everything.

After staying in Jajpur State and Ajmer Commissioner Province for three days, I rushed back to Delhi and stayed at Birla's temple at the invitation of Birla's eldest brother. In addition to providing food and lodging, he also instructed the waiter to send milk and coffee every morning and evening. I visited Professor Yangjia and English friends in India to attend the Central Legislative Council meeting. In addition to the Central Legislative Council building, the three major buildings of the British in India also include the Viceroy's Lodge, which occupies 330 acres, including 12 acres of gardens, and has 340 rooms, costing millions of shields. The lodge was completed in 1929, and the first to live in this house was Lord Irwin. When the electric lights shone at night, it was like daytime, which made it even more magnificent. The second is the Secretariat, which is the office of the central government of India, located next to the Governor's residence. All the buildings are more beautiful than the White House in the United States. The foundation was laid in 1911 and completed in 1930. There are about 1,000 offices inside, and ancient Indian murals are painted everywhere, which is very luxurious. In the evening, I met Birla's eldest brother and agreed to visit his third brother, D.G. Birla, the next afternoon to see the great industry of contemporary India.

Visiting Birla

At 4:00 PM the next afternoon, Birla's eldest brother specially sent his secretary, Mr. Shen, to accompany me to see his third brother Birla. The four brothers all lived together, and their home was not far from the Governor's residence. The house in front was where Birla's staff lived, and the second house was where his family lived. When I arrived at his house, Birla's eldest brother first introduced me to his three brothers, and then his brother Qi Birla led me to his private reception room to talk. He was in his fifties, wearing a pair of gray tortoiseshell glasses, with a calm attitude and a politician's demeanor. In addition to a desk and four sofas, the reception room was decorated with Western and Indian ancient paintings, which felt quite elegant. When we started talking, after exchanging greetings, I asked him bluntly: "Are you willing to go to China?" He replied very clearly: "When Chairman Chiang came to India in 1942, he asked me to go to China to observe the latest developments in various industries, but I am currently too busy with trivial matters to leave. Even if I want to go, it will be next year." So I said to him again: "If time permits, it would be great if you could go to China to investigate industry as soon as possible. Moreover, the heavy industry is very backward, and I hope you can help a lot." At this time, the tone of his reply was quite heavy. "Our own motherland, India, is not completely free and independent, how can we have the energy to help you!" His love for the country was overflowing with words. He was also quite concerned about the Chinese School in Calcutta that I run. I talked with him for more than half an hour, and later, he specially sent a car to send me back. I felt very comfortable living in the Birla Temple, and I felt refreshed by the Brahma bells and Buddhist sounds day and night.

New Delhi is a newly built city with a small population and a vast area. It is rich in modern architecture, and people feel very refreshed here. The old city of Delhi is still as it used to be, with narrow streets and extremely noisy, which is the opposite of the new capital. Old Delhi is the capital of the eight dynasties of India, while New Delhi is the political and economic center of modern India in the future.

### Looking at Private and Public Factories under the Cloud of Industrial Depression

— Hangzhou News, 16th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Almost everyone in the world knows that our Chinese industry has reached the most dangerous time. The appeals and shouts of our domestic industrialists are just a faint sound that cannot arouse much of a stir. Therefore, there is indeed a dying, exhausted, and waiting-to-be-killed spirit.

The common symptoms of general factories are the dumping of foreign goods, high costs, insufficient funds, and sluggish sales. The reporter visited several manufacturers and had this feeling. Manufacturers of daily necessities certainly cannot compete with foreign goods. Even some products that were originally unique to China cannot compete with them. We visited the Minfeng Paper Mill and the Zhongcan Company's silk mill in Jiaxing, and we could see the face of today's Shanxi industry.

The Minfeng Paper Mill is quite large-scale, and it can also be ranked among the top paper mills in the country. This factory has a history of 20 years, and all workshops, dormitories, and offices are modern buildings built with steel and reinforced concrete. In the entire paper mill, there is also a rest garden for employees, arranged as a Western-style garden, exquisite and beautiful.

There are now more than 800 workers in the factory, including plasterers, carpenters, coppersmiths, barbers, etc. Everything necessary for life in society is available here, forming a small society, which can be said to be an extremely complete factory. The current products of the factory are cigarette paper and straw board. They are both made of hemp and straw, which are cut into small pieces, and then mashed. After passing through a rolling pulp ball that can sleep more than 100 people, the pulp is poured onto a paper machine that is more than ten feet long, becoming pages of paper. They can make other kinds of paper, such as newsprint, but unfortunately no one is interested because of the high cost. Now this clean and delicate cigarette paper is also struggling to find its way out. Not long after the victory, Yu, Kun, Hu, Jing, and Han all came to the Minfeng Paper Mill in Jiaxing to purchase cigarette paper, and they chartered planes to transport the number of worlds they needed back to their respective places. But since American cigarette paper came, this domestic cigarette paper has been declining day by day. It is not that American goods are better than Chinese goods. According to an expert, the cigarette paper of Minfeng Paper Mill is better than American goods, but because the price is higher than American goods, under the concept that people are not used to using Chinese goods and cigarette factories also want to reduce costs, they will naturally adopt American cigarette paper because of the temptation of profit.

An ordinary box of cigarette paper has 30 plates, and one plate can make one box of cigarettes, so one box of paper can make 30 boxes of cigarettes. Calculated with the cost plus profit formed by the price and cost of living in Jiaxing, it costs 1 million yuan per box, but American goods come from Chenggong Paper and then from distant America, travel across the ocean to China, and after going through customs procedures, they only need 800,000 yuan per box to reach the places that need it. Therefore, the prosperity of the Minfeng Paper Mill in Jiaxing was only a flash in the pan, and it is now on a downward slope. Straw board is still able to maintain its original sales volume. The United States is unwilling to transport straw board, which is large in area and heavy in weight, to China, so most of the cigarette case paper is still made of Chinese goods, but who can guarantee that it will not be rushed in again in the future? If the tariff policy fails, straw board can also be transported in.

According to the person in charge of the factory: "The current bleak scene of this kind of depression could have been stopped long ago, but because we take into account that these more than 800 workers also have nearly 4,000 people to support, we are reluctantly maintaining it."

He also said: "Fortunately, we are a private factory. If the government had taken over after the war, I am afraid that we would not be able to resume work at all now." This sentence can be said to be on point. Such a large factory would naturally be much slower if it were taken over by the government. When we went to visit, it was a Sunday, but there were people on duty in every workshop. Although the machines were not running, there were still people on duty guarding the machines. So you can know a general idea.

We also went to the silk mill of the China Silk Company. Its original name was Weicheng Silk Mill. When we went, there were only a few staff members in the office. We asked to see the person in charge, and they said that the person in charge had gone out. We asked to visit, and they said that the key was taken away by someone. We asked about the general situation, and they were at a loss for words. We only saw the magnificent buildings, but we didn't know anything about the content. According to the person who guided us to visit: "Their style is much bigger than that of the Minfeng Paper Mill. They often take out Dean Song's big brand." Yes, we realized the difference between government-run and private, and we realized what the person in charge of the Minfeng Paper Mill told us: "Fortunately, we are a private factory. If the government had taken over after the war, I am afraid that we would not be able to resume work at all now."

Based on the above, although it is only an introduction to two factories, we can see the general idea. We can know that the common symptoms of factories are indeed the dumping of foreign goods, high costs, insufficient funds, and sluggish sales. But there is a phenomenon, which is the key to government-run and private. Today, government-run factories have someone to maintain them and someone to support them, but they are doing government work instead of factory work. Although private factories are doing their best to maintain them, they lack the support of the government and are still declining.

To maintain this little bit of fragile industry in China today, the first thing is to eliminate the bureaucratization of factories, and the second is to adopt a protective tariff policy. If our factories are bureaucratized, and all we know is how to do office work and support office workers, but we don't know how to produce, and we don't know how to train technical talents, then there is no way to produce, and we can only flow into the economic situation of a semi-colony. If we do not protect with tariffs, then foreign goods will be dumped into China so much that all Chinese industry will be destroyed, and China will really become a market. Without industry, it will be reduced to the economic status of a semi-colony.

Our country lacks lively and active enthusiasm! Our country's factories really need lively and active familiarity. Without heat, without power, the machines cannot be moved. If the machines cannot be moved, industry cannot flourish and grow.

Women and the Family Published Every Tuesday

### For Young Housewives

— Zheng Xiaowei

Now you have entered a new environment and have a family of your own to manage. You will be with it forever, whether it flourishes or perishes. The fate of the new family depends on your actions. Here are a few points I would like to offer for your consideration:

(1) Make your husband feel that you are not only a gentle and virtuous housewife but also his lover. Many people neglect this after marriage, which often leads to unhappiness in the family. You should maintain your pre-marital appearance and be as enthusiastic and caring about everything he does as before. Especially when your husband comes home from work, do not bother him with daily chores, which will add another layer of gloom to his tired mind. In this way, he will feel that home is his final destination.

(2) Family budget and planning. In today's high-priced world, all daily family expenses depend on your husband's meager income. If there is no budget for spending, the source of income will soon be depleted. This will cause quarrels between husband and wife, with the wife complaining about the husband's incompetence and the husband saying the wife is wasteful. You should first have a budget and spend according to the proportion. Even if you want to add something for yourself, do not act unilaterally. It is best to suggest it to your husband and both agree to buy it together. This way, even if there is not enough money in the future, he will not complain about you alone.

In today's cities, it is not easy to find reasonable housing, but it must be kept tidy and clean. All furniture arrangements should be designed to be practical and beautiful. Maintain beautiful conditions as much as possible, or at least give people a refreshing feeling.

(3) When children come. Marriage always inevitably involves children, who are a symbol and crystallization of love. No parent does not love their children. The purpose of life is to enrich oneself first, then seek the progress of society, and then pass it on to the next generation – the children – so that they continue their wishes forever. Therefore, today's children are the masters of the country in the future. You must educate them well so that they have an upward heart and a healthy physique.

Finally, I must remind you not to forget your husband when taking care of your children. This can sometimes lead to family disputes.

### How to Raise Infants? Dedicated to Mothers

— Yun Yu

Before writing the main text, I must tell all the mothers in the country that children are innocent when they enter the world. Whoever kills them is guilty. It is just as inhumane for wealthy families who do not know how to raise children to often die halfway through as it is for poor families who cannot afford to raise them and drown their babies. Therefore, I would like to tell you how to raise your children here.

Young housewives, the Chinese are uniquely blessed. Where are we blessed? Let me tell you, we are blessed that babies have human milk to eat when they enter the world (those who don’t are in the minority). Human milk, especially from the baby's own mother, is the food that the baby brings with them. Babies do not need to digest it when they eat it, it goes directly into the blood, which is even faster than a blood transfusion. Not only is the nutritional power supreme, but it also gives the baby's body unlimited resistance to resist all diseases. However, if the mother has no milk and hires a wet nurse, this is also a hygienic and good method, because human milk is ultimately superior to everything. However, be sure not to hire a wet nurse with hereditary diseases. This is what mothers should pay attention to. When infants cannot get breast milk, housewives often use cow's milk or goat's milk as a substitute. This is almost a common view among all ethnic groups, but the protein and fat in cow's milk are not easily digested by infants, so it must be diluted. However, if it is diluted, the nutrition will be poor, which can cause diarrhea. Here I can tell you a good method, which is to add rice soup, which can obtain the nutrition of milk without diarrhea. Because rice soup can maintain the colloidal properties of natural milk and promote the development of beneficial Bifidobacteria in the intestines, milk with rice soup can make babies fat and strong.

Fresh green vegetables are an essential supplementary food for every breastfed baby. When babies are two or three months old, they should be fed green leaf soup. When they are older, they can eat vegetable puree every day, as well as fruit puree, orange juice, and watermelon soup, which are all good. We know that butter is indeed a good thing, just like the ghee eaten by our compatriots in Xikang, but imported products are too uneconomical; and cod liver oil is also a foreign product. Our babies need to supplement fat and vitamin A. It is best to have domestically produced butter to eat, otherwise eggs are also good. The baby's stomach cannot digest egg whites, but it can digest egg yolks. Give the breastfed baby three eggs a day, the egg whites for the mother to eat, and the egg yolks for the child to eat, which kills two birds with one stone, and there is no need to send money to beautiful packaging.

There is also liver, which can be said to be complete with vitamins, and there are many undiscovered elements. Do not underestimate it. In fact, liver can treat infant malnutrition, weight loss, anemia, dry skin, persistent diarrhea and other diseases. Fresh liver should be given to children more often.

The key thing we need to know is to let infants go outdoors more to enjoy the open air. Although there are very few open spaces in this bustling city of Shanghai, you can also go to nearby parks to breathe fresh air. Human skin is a sensitive organ. The skin is stimulated by sunlight and dry air, which can cause a strong reaction, which is the increase of red blood cells, the increase of metabolism, physical vitality, and mental pleasure. What is obvious is that the appetite is greatly increased, and the appetite is increased, thus increasing weight. Children are often outside, which can exercise the skin and increase the lung's cold and wind resistance to reduce colds. Urban children are more susceptible to colds than rural children for this reason.

Children's physique is trained from childhood. There is an ancient Chinese saying. "To keep children safe, often keep them three points hungry and cold." These three points of hunger and cold contain the meaning of exercise. Babies must have a fixed amount of milk, and it is never a good thing to eat whenever they cry or eat as much as they want. As for clothes, they should be dry and loose, not wrapped too tightly, and they must be bathed often and live outdoors more, so they will definitely be strong when they grow up.

Baby diapers should be made of materials that can absorb water, be boiled, disinfected, and not harm children's skin. Diapers should be part of children's clothing and should be changed frequently. They should be made of white so that the baby's stools can be checked.

In addition, the baby's crying does not mean that he wants to be held. Often when a baby cries, adults will go to hold him, which makes the baby know that crying is the way to be held. As long as you breastfeed on time, bathe on time, change diapers on time, and drink boiled water on time, the baby will naturally not cry. Empirical life education begins with babies.

Experience tells us that a baby's sleep is the most important thing, but sleep should be regular. Newborn babies are of course an exception. Generally, babies who are seven or eight months old must be given a fixed time to sleep. They must get a full night's sleep at night to be considered good. Do not breastfeed at night. Children must develop the habit of sleeping through the night. Older children must be forced to take a nap after lunch. Do not follow the adults and stay up late into the night. In addition, infants' diets must have certain regulations. Please read the article "Infant Diet Sheet" in this column on October 29.

When a child is sick, the mother must quickly ask a doctor for treatment. If friends and relatives have sick children, it is best not to let your own children visit, because children are very infectious. Whooping cough can not only cause lung disease, but also kill the child. Therefore, children's diseases cannot be ignored.

In short, if a young housewife can follow the above methods to raise your children, you can guarantee that your children will definitely be strong and healthy.

### Grape Sponge Cake

— Jing Shu

Yesterday afternoon, I ate a very exquisite dessert at a friend's house. At that time, I asked her where she bought this dessert? Why is it so sweet and delicious. She smiled and told me, "This is not bought, it is the grape sponge cake I made at home." She knew that I liked this kind of cake, so she told me how to make it. Now I am writing it down below. If the readers are happy, you may wish to make some and try it.

(Ingredients): Half a pound of flour, a cup of butter, a cup of lotus root flour, four eggs, four taels of white sugar, a small bowl of raisins, and half a spoonful of dry rice flour.

(Method): Use a shallow jar, pour butter and white sugar into it and mix well, then add flour, lotus root flour, and dry rice flour and mix well. After mixing well, pour the contents of the jar into a sieve. Under the sieve, use a large basin to hold it. When sieving, the powder gradually falls into the basin. Large lumps of powder that remain on the sieve should be crushed by hand and then sieved again. The remaining powder should be as fine as possible. Then break the eggs one by one and pour them into the basin with the grapes. Knead it by hand for twenty minutes. If the weather is dry and the flour is easy to dry, you can add a little water. After mixing the ingredients in the basin evenly, take it out and place it on a flat board, press it into a large round cake, put it in a steamer and steam it in a pot. After one point and one quarter of an hour, take it out when it is cooked, and then place it on an oiled cake baking board and bake it with a slightly warm stove fire. Bake it for half an hour until all the steam of the cake has dried, and the flour close to the iron plate has turned light yellow. Then you can take it out, let it cool completely, cut it into small squares with a knife, serve it on a plate, and it tastes very sweet and delicious, which is beyond words. It is very elegant to use it to entertain guests.

### How to Wash Wool Sweaters

— Shao

If you look closely at a wool sweater and wool pants with a microscope, you can find that its interlocking structure is like fish scales. So, housewives! If you wash wool sweaters and pants improperly or are careless for a while, the fish scales on the wool sweaters and pants will fall off, and they will shrink, harden, and become distorted. Even if it is a new wool sweater, it will no longer be suitable or beautiful, and you will have to give up. Here, I will tell you an effective way to wash wool sweaters and pants:

It is most difficult to wash new wool sweaters and pants, because the soap solution in the water is mostly absorbed by the wool for the first time. If you wash it quickly, the soap solution absorbed by the wool sweater will not be easily washed away for a while. So you should soak the wool sweater for two or three hours before rinsing, or add some ammonia to the water, which will be more effective (add two spoons of ammonia to each gallon of water). Because ammonia contains volatile substances, but the soaking time should only be about twenty minutes. Because if you soak it for too long, the wool will shrink again. Be gentle when washing, and the less friction the better, because if there is too much friction, the "fish scales" will fall off. At the same time, you should not rub it with soap. It is best to use soap flakes or dissolve the soap into the water after cutting it into pieces. The water used should not be too cold or too hot, and the temperature should be the same before and after. After washing the wool sweaters and pants, they must be hung neatly and stretched on all sides when drying, otherwise the wool sweaters will be distorted after drying, which is not easy to correct. It is not comfortable or beautiful to wear.

This method is not only suitable for wool sweaters and pants, but also for woolen fabrics and flannel clothing. Don't be afraid of the tediousness of the above method and plan to take it to the laundry shop. I advise you to try the method I said above first, because it is better to wash wool sweaters and pants at the laundry shop yourself.

### Food Digestion Time

— Xian

After we eat something, sometimes we feel particularly hungry, and sometimes we feel stuck in the stomach. This is really a matter of food digestion time. The following is a food digestion time table, which housewives can also use as a reference for cooking:

Rice - 1 hour (digestion time is the same below)

Roast pork - 1.5 hours

American rice, apples, kelp, grapes - 1 hour and 45 minutes

Broiled beef liver, raw eggs, broad beans, barley, spinach - 2 hours

Milk, oranges - 2 hours and 5 minutes Raw milk, scrambled eggs - 2 hours and 15 minutes

Cake, onions, cucumbers, watermelon, loquat - 2.5 hours

Boiled chicken, pumpkin, scallions, melons - 2 hours and 45 minutes

Soft-boiled eggs, pearl rice, mushrooms - 3 hours

Broiled beef, pickled pork, boiled radishes - 3 hours and 15 minutes

Sausages, corn bread - 3 hours and 20 minutes

Butter, roasted chicken, clams, yams - 3 hours and 30 minutes

Boiled beef - 3 hours and 50 minutes

Broiled pork, pan-fried beef - 4 hours and 20 minutes

From the above foods, the easiest to digest are raw foods, while pan-fried and broiled foods are not easy to digest and should not be eaten often.

### Natural Beauty

— Su Qiu

Loving beauty is indeed an innate characteristic of human beings. I do not object to women's beauty, and I do not object to women using cosmetics to cover up their ugly spots. However, within the possible range, the consumption of cosmetics should be saved, which is not without benefit to the national economy. Moreover, beauty does not necessarily need to be obtained with the help of cosmetics. The so-called cosmetic techniques of the times are not necessarily perfect, and not only do they not benefit the body at all, but they also waste a lot of money and lose natural beauty. Here, I sincerely tell you a few of the most economical beauty techniques:

1. Washing your face (1) Wash your face with hot water, (2) Use high-quality tooth powder to rub your face, (3) Wipe off the accumulated powder with a hot towel. (4) While the face is still moist, apply snow cream from the lower part of the cheeks, going up to the bridge of the nose, and to the concave areas of the eyes. Then gently pat on powder. (5) Then gently wipe off the excess powder with a silk scarf to make the complexion even, delicate and smooth. However, it is best to avoid using scented powder if possible, otherwise it should not be applied too much. Because its raw materials are always a mixture of lead powder and talcum powder. Once applied too much, it can block the excretion work of the facial sweat and sebaceous glands, so that the waste and carbon dioxide in the body accumulate in the pores of the facial sweat glands. Over time, it will gradually accumulate and form black spots. The so-called cause of freckles is partly due to the stagnation of sweat and sebaceous gland excretion.

2. Complexion (1) Mix thin sake or Shaoxing wine with peeled apples and place them in a bottle. After two or three days, add some buckwheat. After another three or four days, use clean gauze or absorbent cotton to dip this mixed solution and rub it on the face several times a day. Over time, the complexion will naturally become rosy. (2) After moisturizing the face with hot water, apply apple dew and wait for it to dry. Then use alum soaked in water to gently rub the face. Over time, it can also become rosy. (3) Water celery contains a large amount of nutrients. Eating more water celery can also make the complexion change over time. (4) Rubbing the face with apple acid every day can also be effective.

3. Skin (1) Wash away the dirt on the face, neck, limbs, etc. with cold water to stimulate the skin, and then rub it with a dry towel until it feels red and hot. If you rub it every day without stopping, it can make the skin delicate and wrinkle-free. (3) After washing with cold water, apply vegetable lotion, which can gradually prevent the skin from becoming rough and maintain its natural beauty. (3) If you want the skin to change from rough to white and tender, you can use tender tofu mixed with apple peel to rub it every morning, which can make the skin tender in more than a month. (4) To remove facial wrinkles, you can use milk and honey to rub it, which can gradually make the skin tighter from loose. (6) To remove facial blemishes, you can use eggplant, cut it into small pieces, and use it to rub the face, which can be removed over time.

4. Hair (1) Hair does not necessarily need to be permed. Perming does not increase beauty. (2) The style does not need to be complicated, because it takes a lot of time and also requires constant tidying. (3) Hair only seeks to be smooth and shiny, not stylish. If your hair is not very smooth, you must wash and comb it diligently.

5. Lips Applying lipstick is unhygienic. It will hinder local blood circulation and isolate contact with oxygen in the air. Over time, the rosy lips will gradually turn pale gray. Here are three simple and convenient methods: (1) Bite open fresh green olives and rub the lips several times a day, which will naturally make the lips rosy and bright over time. (2) Mix rose water with cold boiled water, then add more than ten drops of ammonia water and mix well. Apply it to the lips every day and after a sentence, the lips will be bright red and lovely. (3) In winter, the lips are easily chapped or wrinkled due to dryness. You can use milk with a little boric acid and apply it to the lips every other day to prevent the pain of chapped lips.

As for other things such as dyeing nails, I will not say more here. In short, we want natural beauty, we want healthy beauty. We should abandon all artificial makeup techniques as much as possible, because the beauty of makeup is not long-lasting!

Spring and Autumn

### Old Papers

— Xu Zhongnian

During the War of Resistance, intellectuals in the interior suffered immensely, and the lack of spiritual sustenance was even more acute than the lack of physical food. The people regard food as heaven, and the "real rice" distributed by the government to public school teachers was indeed old and yellow, had been heated, and sometimes even moldy; however, rice is always rice, regardless of its quality, and it can fill the stomach. Spiritual sustenance is different: coarse rice, old rice, one can hold one's nose and brace oneself to swallow it; but bad works, articles with excessively low taste, or paintings, or melodies, one "simply" (Sichuan dialect) dares not accept! Moreover, we who teach foreign literature have been cut off from the foreign literary world for years, and we are not only blind to new works, but even revisiting old ones is impossible, because who would carry reference books while fleeing for their lives! Thus, we went from monotony to feeling depressed, and from depression we fell into the abyss of pain.

After the restoration, apart from a small number of resourceful people who became officials and made fortunes, most of the writing friends were "poor" and "busy," the poorer the busier, and then the busier the poorer. Acquiring books became almost impossible; but, if one were fortunate enough that the family's books in the occupied areas were not lost, or not completely lost, then one could completely "revisit the old," or at least "revisit" a part, waiting for the "knowing the new" in one's dreams!

The Central University Library has a considerable number of French books: literature, philosophy, social sciences, linguistics, science, all are there; unfortunately, the number is always small, there are no new books at all, and the old books also lack a systematic arrangement. Relatively well-planned and selective is still my old friend Dr. Ling Menghen's collection, a total of five thousand volumes. However, he is a doctor of sociology, so his collection is most refined in books on social science research, and the others—such as literary books—recede as "accessories"; furthermore, this set of books was donated by his wife after his death to commemorate him, and there was no way to choose, nor should there be any choice. I should bear full responsibility for the formation of this situation: because I taught French literature and French at Central University for fifteen years, I should have contributed opinions on the purchase of French books. For example, the professors who teach English and American literature and English, the largest in number, pooled their wisdom and opened or co-opened book lists, and the purchase of English and American books was most complete. Also, German books, under the guidance of Professor Shang Zhangsun, although small in number, were quite organized. Only I have not fulfilled my responsibility! Why? Because: (1) I myself have a considerable number of books, especially contemporary novels, collected quite richly; (2) At that time, I ran back and forth between Nanjing and Shanghai, and Shanghai had a French Association Library with hundreds of thousands of French books, and I was a member of the association and could borrow books. But, once I arrived in Chongqing, I suffered the consequences! If the French Embassy stationed in Chongqing's Consulate Lane had not provided me with convenience, I would definitely not have been able to write the lengthy articles, later included in "The Main Trends of French Literature" (Commercial Press): "Forty Years of French Literature," "French Literature Under the Nazi Iron Heel," and "French Literature Before the Liberation of Paris," three reportorial essays.

How I miss the Chinese and French books left behind in my home in Shanghai! And the feeling of missing is even more profound because the French books I placed in Central University in Nanjing—including the articles I published in Paris, Lyon, Beijing, or Switzerland over the years—were bombed! Upon returning after the restoration, I was eager to organize these books: not only because I had not seen them for nine years, but also because during the occupation era, my family burned a lot of books that were "offensive" to the enemy and puppets for me. The sorting work proceeded very slowly: not because there were too many books, but because I browsed while sorting. Furthermore, whenever I was tired of writing, I would go to sort. However, this work did not give me rest: working past midnight was nothing, and once I even went to sleep at three-thirty in the morning!

Oh! Old papers, loyal friends! In this chaotic era, the warmth and coldness of the world have become the norm; only you, do not fawn on me because I am successful—have I ever been successful?—nor look down on me because I am frustrated! Oh! Old papers, you are also my mirror: you frankly display my previous writings before me, allowing me to compare them with my current works; progress? Regression? Or stagnation? Oh! Old papers, you are even more of a watershed between the pure and the turbid: many people, their articles remain here, their loyal behavior during the War of Resistance proves the consistency of their words and deeds; and some people—fortunately, a small number—although they made vows in the past, speaking eloquently, in the end, the fox's tail was revealed, unable to withstand the tempering of the great era, and fell into the cesspool of traitors!

Oh! Old papers, how can I thank you enough? You have freed me from the shackles of "time"; no, you have bestowed upon me the supernatural power to go back to the "past," forcing my unfaithful "memory" to submit. Thanks to you, oh! Old papers, I have remembered many things; especially I found the date of the first "Literary Tea Party" held—that was June 19, 1932, Sunday—which instantly relieved me of fourteen years. You also made me recall many funny things. Since I mentioned the "Literary Tea Party," let me talk about its funny story: Sun Chuntai and Zhang Yiping were both very enthusiastic old tea friends, and our monthly "Literary Tea Party" was initially published by them. Unexpectedly, after the fifth issue (December 1932), the two had a disagreement: the magazine was then managed by Chuntai alone; Yiping founded "Literary Spring and Autumn" (July 1933) to show resistance. Also, for some unknown reason, as late as April 23, 1933, "Literary Tea Party" published an important announcement in "Shishi Xinbao"; on September 1, a "Zhang Yiping Announcement" was also published on the inner page of the first volume, third issue of "Literary Spring and Autumn": each stated their own reasons. Looking at it today, the matter is so small that it cannot be smaller, but in those days, they must have argued red-faced: truly interesting!

But, old papers, I also have to complain to you a few times, because you have brought me silver-gray melancholy. Among you, I found a photo of me when I first went abroad to study: twenty-six years of time have turned me into a middle-aged man! In the surviving old letters, I found letters written to me by the French Countess de Noailles and the Argentine Countess Victoria O'Campo: this discovery reminded me of early May 1930, when Sir Rabindranath Tagore held a book exhibition in Paris. On the day of the preview, a photo was taken: Tagore with white hair and silver beard, standing in the center; Mrs. Noailles in pink, and Mrs. O'Campo in apricot silk, standing on the left and right: three countries, three genius poets! Tagore also asked me about Xu Zhimo! Now it is certain that two of the three have died, and I have lost contact with Mrs. O'Campo for more than ten years! Alas! (3/5, 11/21, Evening)

### A Word on Poetry

— Lin Feng

Poetry is the crystallization of emotion, the embodiment of beauty, leaning on the crutch of imagination, visiting remote and novel places.

Poetry is the spark that bursts out in the long river of time. Days without poetry have neither light nor heat, and that would be unbearable loneliness.

Poetry is not far from people. On the contrary, it lies dormant in people's hearts. It is the most wonderful part of people's hearts. As long as you have not been defiled by the stinking vulgarity of merchants, you will eventually open it.

### Sanqu Poet Huang Da-chi

— Zhen Yuan

During the Yuan Dynasty, Sanqu (a type of Chinese song) was popular in all strata of society, from high-ranking officials and nobles to officials in charge of theatrical troupes, and courtesans, all were good at composing songs. Zhong Sicheng's "Record of Ghosts" listed Sanqu writers including scholars, counselors, marshals, censors, and prefects; Taiping Yuefu Qinglou Ji and Zhu Genglu collected many works by courtesans, such as Wang of Dadu and Shunshi Xiu; as for general playwrights who also wrote Sanqu, it is even harder to enumerate them all. This is enough to show how widely Yuan Sanqu was circulated and how numerous the authors were. Only the short Ci poetry of the Song Dynasty and the popular songs of the Ming Dynasty can be compared with it before and after. The reason why they were able to flourish for a while is that the lyrics are simple and easy for everyone to understand, which is certainly one reason; but the main reason is that the tunes are simple, everyone can sing, everyone can compose, and once written, they can be performed with pipes and strings at any time and spread to the world. This situation is somewhat similar to the current musical scores. At that time, music and lyrics were integrated, so even entertainers could compose songs. As for men of letters, it goes without saying. Most playwrights of the Yuan Dynasty were scholars who floated up and down the lower ranks and teachers of calligraphy, but there were many men of letters among Sanqu writers. The reason for this is that drama is a spoken form, which includes three elements: Ke (stage directions), Bai (dialogue), and Qu (songs), and attention must be paid to the structure, which is not easy for non-professionals to do well; Sanqu can narrate events and is easier to express emotions, without the worries of Ke Bai and structure, and the Xiaoling form (a type of Sanqu) is very simple, so even non-professionals can engage in it. This created the golden age of Sanqu, and many men of letters devoted themselves to it. The painter Huang Gongwang was one of these non-professional songwriters. He seemed to have written many Sanqu in those days, so Zhong Sicheng regarded him as a songwriter and recorded him in "Record of Ghosts". There are many records of his life and paintings, but as for songwriting, it is only seen in Zhong's description. The author of "Record of Ghosts" did not have a deep relationship with Da Chi, so he was placed in the list of "dead talents who do not know each other." "Record of Ghosts" records Huo Chi saying:

"Gongwang, whose courtesy name is Ziju, is the second younger brother of Lu Shentang. He lived in Ziyou Lane, Qinchuan, Gusu. When he was young, he was adopted by the Huang family in Wenzhou as a posthumous son, hence the surname. When his father was ninety, he just established a heir, saw Ziju and said, "Huang Gongwang has been waiting for a long time." He first served as a judge in the Zhejiang West Circuit, and was involved in the management of farmland and grain due to some matter and was vindicated. Later, he was framed by the powerful in Beijing. He changed his name to Yifeng. Originally living in Songjiang, he called himself a recluse using divination skills, abandoned worldly affairs, changed his name to Kuxing Jingsheng, and was also known as Dachi Weng. Gongwang's learning does not need to be embellished; as for the scholars of the world, there is nothing he does not know, and even the smallest skills and arts, there is nothing he cannot do, and he can write long Ci poetry and short Qu poetry as soon as he puts his pen to paper, and everyone respects him as a teacher, and he can also paint."

The above is the popular version of "Record of Ghosts" collated by Wang Guowei. The Ming Dynasty Siming Fan's Tianyige manuscript of "Record of Ghosts" (the original book was recently obtained by Mr. Zheng Zhenduo) has many differences from the popular version, such as the opening sentence "His name is Gongwang, a native of Songjiang," without the passage "Lu Shentang" to "has been waiting for a long time," "circuit judge" is written as "circuit censor," etc. (judging from Huang Gongwang's biography, the popular version is more coherent than the manuscript), but the events are all complete.

The Yuan Dynasty Sanqu anthologies that have been passed down to the present include Yang Chaoying's Taiping Yuefu, Yangchun Baixue, Anonymous Yuefu Xinsheng, Yuefu Qunzhu, Yuefu Qunyu, and Ziran Ji, but there are no Sanqu by Da Chi among them, and no Sanqu by him are included in the Ming Dynasty Qu selections, so it seems that his Sanqu have been scattered and lost for a long time.

Unexpectedly, I found a Xiaoling poem outside the Qu selections, which is collected in the third collection of "Hanfenlou Secret Books" "Sun's Calligraphy and Painting Notes". "Calligraphy and Painting Notes" was compiled by Sun Feng, a Ming Dynasty mounter, based on what he saw. It is titled "Li Song's Skull Fan", and the poem says:

[No bit of skin or flesh, only a stone of bitterness and sorrow, this puppet pulls the silk threads, playing a small trick to tease the enemy, recognize the shame, shouldn't you be ashamed? Stupidly going alone for five miles]. At the end it is written: "Made by Dachi Daoren on the tenth day of the third month of the spring of Zhizheng Jiawu, written by his disciple Xiu Xiu Wang Xuanzhen on the right, to 'Zuizhongtian'."

Although this Xiaoling poem is not top-notch in Yuan Sanqu, it is Da Chi's "only remaining" work. In addition to Huang, other Yuan Dynasty painters who also wrote Sanqu include Ni Yunlin, Ming Jia Zhongming Ji recorded his "Shuixianzi" in "Record of Ghosts", and "Lidai Shiyu" recorded five of his Xiaoling poems, and there are not many other works. Since the Sanqu of the two families are rare in the literature, there may be surviving ones in the colophons of books, and if they can be collected, it will also be a groundbreaking work for collecting lost Yuan Sanqu.

### Homecoming Poetry Notes

— Lv Baihua

Arriving in Hangzhou

Reducing Kejia quoted the simile of the Book of Songs and talked about how to use adjectives to beautify sentences. I thought of often using "lightning and wind" to compare the speed of something {at the same time, the actual description of these four words is also very appropriate. For example, when we take the tram, isn't it really "lightning"? On the train, I thought of these four words, but the train is not a tram, so you can't say "lightning," it should be "fire" or "steam."

Fire-propelled wheels, or straddling giant beasts that cross the fields, one can see the mountain scenery of Hangzhou. This metropolis that occupies the most famous lake and mountain scenery in China will soon be able to re-examine its elegance in a few minutes. After ten years of separation, it has struggled arduously in the unprecedented catastrophe and become magnificent.

"Look! Our plane!" Everyone enthusiastically cheered, it was Jianqiao Airport, and our newborn flying generals were constantly practicing.

Then, everyone repeated the luggage they had placed in a chaotic manner, and I still sat there blankly, because I had a good friend in Hangzhou surnamed Chen, and I was going to his place to go back to my hometown together. He is an inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs, and now he is busy handling the county magistrate examination, and he is also my childhood friend. The reason for sitting blankly is that his firm face seems to have appeared in front of me.

At this time, a cold wind swept in from the train window, and it started to rain.

How many stops have the fire-propelled wheels traveled,

The mountains and rivers have not changed, recognizing the returning person;

Meeting Zhongju on the day of boarding the car,

The drizzle Lin Zong is ashamed to wipe the headscarf!

### Couplets at Yu Dunhui's Stele Pavilion

— Mei

The statue of Li Tongmin, Duke of Huxin, Shanghai, was established in the City Temple, recalling the couplets on the Yu Dunhui Memorial Stele Pavilion in the public sports field. One was written by the village gentleman Yao Gongjing: "Filial piety and friendship can be modeled in the family, and education can be extended to the village, and it is really far to relieve hunger in thousands of miles. Good deeds are not slack, day by day Dun, diligent application is selfless, called Hui, the two words are privately given, I hope everyone is convinced." One was written by Mr. Shen Xinqing: "Only the good people can bless their village, and those who come later take it as a model. If the whole country is like this old man, the world is not enough to be peaceful." Reading this, one can imagine the gentleman's character. Now the pavilion and the stele are said to have been destroyed by thieves. I record this as an aid to those who care about local history.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 104

— Ye Jingfeng

He Jian heard her sudden question, his heart was shocked, but his face was still very calm. He straightened the glass of "Victory Drink" for her, and used this leisurely little action to gently suppress the surging thoughts in his mind, not letting them show on the outside. The thoughts, statistically, are probably a string of illogical fragments: "Strange, have I seen her in Xingli?" "What exactly is going on here? What kind of trick is this?" "Looking at her resentful look, this guy's expression is not bad... No, she is simply the master of expression." "No, how can she be as innocent as Yaoqun?" "She is talking nonsense in broad daylight... Dare to use these words to test the master!" ... "Strange, why does she have this resentful expression?" "Could it be that I met her there before going abroad?" "Or a playmate when I was very young... Mizi? ... Kikuko? ... Aoko? ... Or Fangzi?" "Impossible! They can't be reborn, growing so beautiful in ten years! Absolutely impossible, and there is not a trace of the old impression between her eyebrows and eyes." "Then, where have I seen her? ... Is this really the first time we have met? ..."

"No..." He Jian suppressed the rising thoughts, "It can't be considered the first time we have met!" He also used a question with "吧".

She smiled, smiling so娇饥, so mischievously, the smile seemed to contain a sarcastic meaning.

"I'm very rude, Mr. He Jian!" Because I felt that I was laughing beyond the limits, "But, where have we met?"

This question is inevitably a bit of a naked prank, forcing He Jian to seem to have no room for retreat.

"Regarding Miss, I dare not say casually, on my part, at least this is the second time!"

"Then, the first time was..." She was overly playful.

"It was the moment Miss walked in... I have already admired you sincerely!" He Jian added a "slippery" to the "oil" to deal with her excessive prank. Seeing two red colors immediately appear on her rosy cheeks, I felt that I was also a bit too slippery, but the corners of my mouth still slipped out without reservation, "Not only that, but..." The words below were a bit close to frivolous, and I felt that I didn't have the courage to say them.

"And?" Miao asked to hear what he said next, although he was somewhat shy, but also resented him for only caring about the pleasure of his tongue, regardless of the predicament of others.

"And in my dreams, there are often beautiful images of Miss like this, flying from the sky, giving me infinite comfort, just like tonight."

"Thank you!" She thoroughly uses the way European and American women speak, thanking people for praising her beauty, but in fact, her Eastern nature makes her red even to the sideburns, and her head is about to drop. Fortunately, I caught a glimpse of the glass of "Victory Drink" in front of me, with a slice of orange heart floating on it, and a bright red foreign cherry inlaid on the orange heart, as if to greet her and say: "Drink quickly, you still have a chance to win!"

"Mr. He Jian," she took a sip of orange juice from the straw, feeling refreshed, and indeed gained new courage; she reversed He Jian's almost frivolous tone from a psychological point of view, as a sincere compliment. She also stood on the position of being worthy of it, and repeated the mechanical and reluctant "thank you" just now in a more natural and beautiful voice, "Thank you for your praise... Apart from my mother and myself in the mirror, today is the first time I have heard someone sincerely praise me like this. However..."

### Yü Ch’ia-ch’ing Road

— Shao Fu

Mr. Yu Qiaqing's coffin was escorted yesterday in this city. The funeral procession was nearly a mile long. The posthumous honors were evident in general. In the midst of life and death, it is commonly said that there is a great difference, but in reality, it is still determined by the person's true contribution and true impact on society and the masses. Human feelings may be very thin, but after all, it is impossible to erase those true contributions.

Mr. Yu devoted his life to revitalizing industry and to social welfare undertakings. Especially for the contribution of Shanghai society, almost everyone knows. We can see from his pre-death aspirations that he wanted to run Siming University, Siming Middle School, Qiaqing Hospital, and Aquatic School, etc., so we know how much this person is exhausting his efforts to seek welfare for the public.

It is said that at the memorial service, Mr. Wang Xiaolai proposed to restore Tibet Road to Yu Qiaqing Road in order to commemorate this practical entrepreneur. This method is very appropriate. What's more, during the concession period, this road was renamed with this name. The concession authorities used it to show respect during his lifetime. Can't we use it to express our condolences after his death?

We think that the municipal authorities will definitely consider this issue carefully.

### Master

— Qi Ying

In the elevator of the building, a Western woman who could speak some Chinese asked the driver: "Which floor is Lawyer Gu on?" The driver asked: "What does he do?" Answer: "Lawyer" The driver said: "I don't know". Someone next to him said: "He's a lawyer!" The driver suddenly realized: "Oh! On floor ×". After the Western woman left, the driver said: "Why is a lawyer called 'Master'?"

### Please Do Not Scribble Randomly on Post Office Workers' Concerns

— Yu Bingcan

A few days ago, I saw an article by Wen Zhenjun, "Don't Forget 'Local,'" in this publication. As a letter sorter in the post office, I feel that many people now do not follow the customary format when writing the sender's and recipient's names and addresses on envelopes. As Wen Zhenjun said, writing "Local" on letters in "Local" areas and adding the word "Local" to street names requires attention. But today, I want to bring up a matter that requires extra attention from all sectors: Nowadays, some people often mix up and reverse the sender's and recipient's names and addresses on envelopes, which greatly affects the speed and accuracy of our letter sorting. For example, American-made airmail letter sheets, recently sold on the market, can be used for two purposes (the back can be used to write the letter, and the front is printed with an envelope format; after writing the letter, simply fold it according to the format printed on the front to form a letter). Therefore, many people use these sheets to write letters. In America, these airmail letter sheets are specifically used for airmail, but in the hands of our countrymen, they are even used for regular mail, which is a separate matter. However, according to the envelope format printed on the front, there is a horizontal dotted line in the upper left corner, which is for writing the sender's name and address. The blank space in the upper right corner is for sticking stamps, and the large blank square in the middle is for writing the recipient's name and address. But now, many people write arbitrarily. They write the recipient's name and address on the dotted line and the sender's name and address in the large blank space. Some write the sender's name and address in the blank space for sticking stamps and the recipient's name and address on the dotted line, while sticking multiple other stamps in the large blank space in the middle. Some write both the sender's and recipient's names and addresses in the large blank space at the same time; some write vertically, some horizontally. Such random writing, without regard to horizontal, vertical, up, down, left, and right, truly gives us letter sorters a headache, because we strive for speed and accuracy when sorting letters. When we encounter such randomly written letters, we have to spend half a minute or a minute to clarify the sender's and recipient's names and addresses. Sometimes, the sender doesn't write "Sealed" at the end, making it difficult to distinguish the sender's and recipient's names and addresses. We even have to look at the place name on the post office stamp to determine which is the sender's name and address and which is the recipient's name and address. If we have to look at each letter so carefully, how can we sort through the piles of letters in a limited amount of time?

Another point is that some Chinese-style store name envelopes used by several businesses have the store name printed in the lower left corner of the envelope, while the store's address is printed in the upper right corner, which is also unacceptable.

Therefore, if all sectors want letters to be delivered quickly, it depends on writing the sender's and recipient's names and addresses clearly and separately according to custom when writing the letter. Finally, one more point, please also pay attention to not writing the place name incorrectly when writing the address. For example, if you want to send to "Nanshi Menghua Street" but write it as "Nanjing Menghua Street." We know that this kind of writing is a typo, but since they wrote "Nanjing," we can't change it for them. Perhaps "Nanjing" also has a "Menghua Street"? If their original intention was indeed to send it to "Nanshi Menghua Street," but because of one wrong word, we can only send it to "Nanjing" for a round trip of more than 620 kilometers!

### ### Can You Answer: How Many Countries Are There in the World?

— Zhengfan

"How many countries are there in the world?" This is indeed a very interesting question that many people want to know, but I believe the vast majority of people cannot answer this question. The reason is: the world is so big and the land is so vast that, apart from those important and well-known major countries such as the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, which are naturally never forgotten, there are also those small countries in remote corners that "do not compete with the world," which are not very "well-known." For example, where is "San Marino"? How many people live in "Liechtenstein"? Most people will be "tongue-tied" and not know what to say. Normally, it seems that there are no books about the statistics of countries around the world. Therefore, "How many countries are there in the world?" has always been a mystery in the minds of ordinary people.

Here, let me tell you: there are currently sixty-nine countries in the world (North Korea and the Republic of Outer Mongolia are not included).

The names of these sixty-nine countries are all on the map. It is inconvenient to copy them here. The following are some uncommon country "nicknames." If you find them unfamiliar, please check the map:

(1) Venezuela (2) Yemen (3) Guatemala (4) Ecuador (5) Haiti (6) El Salvador (7) Dominican Republic (8) Honduras (9) Nicaragua (10) San Marino (11) Liechtenstein.

### The Key to Peace

— Xiangzhi

In this era of unpredictable international winds and clouds and increasingly complex domestic disputes, every corner of the world is issuing calls for peace. On the afternoon of October 27th, I went to the YMCA and listened to a lecture by political scientist Mr. Gu Zhengshu, entitled "The Key to Peace." Mr. Gu expressed his deep regret in his tone for the unpeaceful situation in the country and was deeply worried about the open and secret struggles between countries. He explained the crux of peace, analyzed the content of peace, and was thorough and insightful, moving the audience. Now, I will briefly record the main points of his speech as follows:

"We need peace because we fear war. War is collective killing, war is the expression of human depravity, war is large-scale destruction, and war is the destruction of human civilization. US President Truman once said that if the Third World War does not happen, then fine, but if it does happen, the world will face its end. Because if this war happens, scientific killing weapons such as atomic energy and cosmic rays will be used extensively, and all mankind can be declared destroyed in a short period of time. You and I will all be turned into dust and smoke. Therefore, we hope for peace, world peace, and lasting peace.

But how can we obtain lasting peace? We don't have to seek far away; as long as we study the word "peace," we can obtain the key to peace. The English word for peace is "Peace," and this word can be translated into Chinese in three ways: (1) 和平 (hé píng, peace), (2) 平安 (píng ān, safety), and (3) 太平 (tài píng, great peace).

Now, let's first look at the "和" (hé) in 和平 (hé píng). "和" is composed of "禾" (hé, grain) and "口" (kǒu, mouth). "禾" means rice, and "口" means people. If everyone has food to eat, wouldn't everything be harmonious? This is an economic issue.

Now, let's look at the "安" (ān) in 平安 (píng ān). "安" is composed of "宀" (mián, roof) and "女" (nǚ, woman). "宀" means "home," and "女" means housewife. If every family is managed and in good order, wouldn't that become an ideal society? At the same time, the creator of the character only put one "女" under "宀," meaning that if a family has two housewives, the home will feel uneasy. In short, it is necessary to ensure that everyone gets what they need, so as to achieve the state of "the old are cared for until their end, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled are all provided for." This is a social issue.

Let's look at the "平" (píng) in 太平 (tài píng). "平" is composed of "二" (èr, two) and "半" (bàn, half). This can be interpreted as "two people standing on the same plane" or "two people with one heart." That is to say, everyone is equal, lives in peace, and jointly pursues peace. If we can do this, wouldn't we be very close to our ideal society? This is a moral issue.

If these three basic principles can be deeply imprinted in the minds of all the world's great politicians, included in the plans of social reformers, and permeated into the United Nations, then we will surely be able to avoid the catastrophe of the Third World War and ensure lasting world peace."

Finally, Mr. Gu quoted a passage from the Christian Bible, warning:

"Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand!"

### The Government Claims to Promote National Products, But Officials are Given Imported Melton Cloth as Ration

— Lisheng

It turns out that the authorities are benefiting public school personnel by implementing "rationing," and the rationed items are all genuine American goods!

Since the dumping of foreign goods, domestic products have been neglected due to heavy costs, resulting in a crisis in the domestic industry and commerce, and even factory closures! Manufacturers struggling for their future have united and called for people to use domestic products, using "Using domestic products is the most glorious" as a slogan to save the decline.

Government personnel at all levels are also anxiously thinking about ways out for the domestic industry and commerce, such as releasing foreign exchange and providing industrial and commercial loans. In Shanghai, they have also cracked down on American goods stalls... etc., directly and indirectly supporting domestic industry and commerce, which cannot be said to be without effort.

However, there is a strange thing that has appeared in the midst of the enthusiastic promotion of national products and the rescue of industry and commerce, which the public has accepted calmly without any different opinions. In fact, it is a powerful irony that makes foreigners laugh!

Civil servants wear Zhongshan suits made of Melton cloth and still encourage the people to "love and use national products as the most glorious." Are the common people still willing to learn? Therefore, if the authorities really want to promote national products, they should at least increase domestic products and reduce American goods in the rationed items; otherwise, it will be like slapping themselves in the face.

### It is Best to Change the Time for Inviting Mr. Soldiers to See a Show to Sunday

— Speaker

"Soldiers sigh in vain with tickets, the time is set inappropriately; twelve o'clock is the meal time, after eating and going to the show, it's already over!"

Once it comes to Friday, everyone who is busy with official duties is preparing for the "weekend." Schools and factories all have "weekly meetings," "weekend tea parties," and "weekend evening parties" to restore the tired and exhausted spirit of the week with a happy mood.

Today, in the "soldier" group, there are of course recreational activities following the usual practice on weekends. In Shanghai's "soldier" organizations, major theaters also give away weekend invitation tickets, which is truly a feast for the eyes, making "Mr. Soldier" smile happily.

On Friday afternoon, the invitation tickets came, a large bundle of red and green floral paper. The Grand Theater, Golden Theater, Great Light Theater, International Theater, Peking Opera, Movies, Shaoxing Opera, and Kunqu Opera are matched so harmoniously, enjoying entertainment as you wish. However, the fly in the ointment is that the invitation time is at noon, which is the meal time on the "soldier's" schedule—twelve o'clock—If you rush to the remote place to arrive on time without betraying the "invitation," this lunch must be sacrificed. If you want to "please your eyes," you can only "hurt your stomach."

Some people are willing to suffer their stomachs and not betray the good intentions, arriving on time, but they are "nervous" and "uneasy" because there are no holiday regulations on weekend afternoons, and they still work as usual. If, unfortunately, the official business in charge comes, by the time you return, the official rank has already been lowered on you!

Why, why! Spend the weekend having fun in suffering. Because there is "suffering" in "fun," everyone "sighs in vain looking at the ticket"!

The red and green tickets specially printed for the grand invitation to the National Army are thrown in the corner of the drawer. It is a pity to discard them, but useless to take them. You can only stick the invitation tickets given each time in a book to make a book of Shanghai theater ticket explorations, which can earn you a sum of money on the curious mind!

The discipline of "Mr. Soldier" is becoming more and more orderly every day, and the order of entertainment venues is also increasing. Everyone hopes that the time for "inviting the National Army" can be changed to Sunday when it does not interfere with "meal arrangements." In that case, both the host and the guest will be happy!

Attached is a limerick, respectfully addressed to the theater owners:

Working hard for five days, the weekend arrives, Thank you, boss, for sending theater tickets,

A large pile of red and green floral paper, The printing cost is eaten at a loss,

Soldiers sigh in vain with tickets, The time is set inappropriately,

Twelve o'clock is the meal time, After eating and going to the show, it's already over,

If you don't eat, your stomach is empty, Hurry back to the department to work;

If you happen to meet a superior, The official tone beats you like a sample,

Watching or not watching is difficult, But I hate the poor soldier,

Thank you very much, big boss, For the free spirit and labor,

If you are sincerely treating us, Why not change the date to Sunday!

A Soldier's Request
