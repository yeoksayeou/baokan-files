### National Army Advances on Zhangjiakou from Multiple Routes; Communist Forces Withdraw Entirely from the Siege of Datong; Fu Zuoyi's Troops Continue Southward in Pursuit

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 10th] The National Army is advancing on Zhangjiakou from multiple routes. The Communist forces near Zhangjiakou still have approximately ten units, but their strength is weak and difficult to sustain. According to sources in Zhangjiakou, in addition to preparing for demolition, they issued an emergency appeal to the city's 170,000 residents on the 19th in the name of the Municipal Party Committee, calling on citizens to actively participate in the "self-defense war." Furthermore, the Xinhua News Agency reported from Zhangjiakou on the 19th, acknowledging that the Communist forces attacking Datong have already completely withdrawn.

[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, This Newspaper, 10th] It is reported that after capturing Xuanzhen on the afternoon of the 19th, Fu Zuoyi's troops are currently continuing their advance. It is rumored from Zhangjiakou that the Communist forces have gathered 300,000 troops, but they are showing signs of wavering. It is expected that the National Army will be able to enter Zhangjiakou smoothly.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, responded to reporters' inquiries today regarding the Zhangjiakou and Datong issues, stating: Whether the National Army will recover Zhangjiakou is entirely dependent on the orders of the higher authorities. It is not impossible even without progress in the Nanjing negotiations. However, the claim that the National Army has already pressed on Zhangjiakou is completely unfounded. The National Army in the Jehol region has recovered Fengning, northwest of Chengde. The National Army's actions have not yet crossed the Jehol border. When asked how long it would take to recover Zhangjiakou, Wang stated that while a week is short, it would not extend to several months. The National Army has this confidence. Regarding the strength of the Communist forces defending Zhangjiakou, Wang stated that the combat-ready forces are approximately 20,000. Wang also informed reporters that the siege of Datong has been lifted. The Communist forces have lost the ability to attack Datong. Fu Zuoyi's troops, continuing south, can join forces with the troops attacking from Datong near Datong.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] A spokesperson for a senior agency denied today that the National Army has begun operations against Zhangjiakou, stating that there has been no significant development, but the situation is favorable to the National Army. They vaguely mentioned the overall situation but stated that there may be significant developments by the end of the month. Senior personnel from various military command agencies here are frequently in contact.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] The battle for Zhangjiakou is currently brewing. This afternoon, the last batch of relief supplies, 490 tons, from the Executive Headquarters in Qinglongqiao was transported to Miaozhuang in the Communist area. Since this batch of government-promised supplies has been completely transported, it is expected that the situation there will become tense in the short term. However, both sides are currently in the mobilization stage, and a major battle may not occur within a week. According to Zhu Sai'an, a staff member of the Executive Headquarters who came to Beiping from Zhangjiakou today, Zhangjiakou is accelerating the evacuation of people and supplies and has now become a half-empty city. Trains from Zhangjiakou to Miaozhuang and westward are dedicated to military transport, and passenger tickets have been discontinued. Both the Executive Headquarters and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) cannot distribute relief supplies to various counties because the Communist forces are mobilizing. Currently, two staff members from the Executive Headquarters and three from UNRRA remain in Zhangjiakou, while Miaozhuang has three from the Executive Headquarters and one from UNRRA.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] The Executive Headquarters will dispatch a plane to Zhangjiakou tomorrow to pick up the Executive Sub-Committee. The Executive Headquarters dispatched a plane to Zhangjiakou today to convey orders. The claim that the airfield there has been destroyed is inaccurate.

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Amidst the tense situation in Zhangjiakou, the government and American radio stations of the sub-committee stationed there by the Military Mediation Department have been forced to dismantle by the Communist forces and have lost contact with this side. The Military Mediation Department is preparing to dispatch a plane to pick up the sub-committee back to Beiping as soon as it obtains the consent of the Communist forces. It is also learned that the Military Mediation Department is planning to send another sub-committee to Guihua, possibly led by Nanpu, but this has not yet been officially decided.

### It is Reported That Fu Zuoyi Telegraphed Mao Zedong, Hoping That the Communist Party Would Change its Style, Thoroughly Abandon Military Force, and Participate in the Government

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] Fu Zuoyi, Commander of the Twelfth War Zone, today released "A Telegram to Mao Zedong," appealing for peace, totaling over 3,000 words. He stated that the Communist attack on Datong forced the National Army to take rescue action. In the Battle of Jining, the Communist forces suffered over 20,000 casualties, and Mao Zedong should not shirk his responsibility. The bloodshed from the Baotou battle until now is a lesson for the Communist Party, which should recognize and reflect on it, thereby changing its past style, exploring new lines, thoroughly abandoning military force, participating in the government, and ending the war. The government has no desire to fight the Communist Party. Finally, Fu Zuoyi expressed hope that Mao Zedong would immediately participate in the government under the premise of nationalizing the military and democratizing politics, and recommend that the Communist Party or others replace Fu Zuoyi's position. [Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Guihua, 10th] The text of Commander Fu Zuoyi's telegram to Mao Zedong is as follows: To Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, Since Japan's surrender last year, you launched an attack on Baotou, firing the first shot of the civil war. The ignorant like me thought at the time that this was a temporary or partial action on your part and would not become your party's policy. Therefore, I telegraphed you on October 24, making a frank and sincere appeal. However, the tragic facts of the past year have proven that this was a long-prepared plan, not an accidental mistake, and therefore negotiations have been fruitless, and the overall war has continued to escalate. Recently, due to your betrayal of promises and the siege of Datong, the government's efforts to resolve the situation peacefully have been completely unsuccessful. The National Army of this war zone was forced to take action to rescue Datong. However, this is painful and not pleasant. Its purpose is only to relieve the siege of Datong and rescue the 20,000 citizens of Datong. However, you believe in the omnipotence of military force and mobilized 17 brigades and 51 regiments in an attempt to annihilate the National Army in Jining. The fierce urban and suburban warfare continued for four days, and finally you were defeated. The day before your defeat, Yan'an broadcast that the National Army of this war zone had been completely surrounded, completely defeated, and completely annihilated by you. But the facts of the next day immediately provided a ruthless proof that it was not the National Army that was surrounded, defeated, and annihilated, but your so-called main forces of He Long's, Nie Rongzhen's, Zhang Zongxun's, Chen Zhengxiang's, Yao Zhe's, who had "participated in the 25,000-li Long March." I do not believe that this is a military victory, because as you said, the National Army of this war zone has the worst weapons, the fewest personnel, and the weakest combat power, and its desire for war is not as strong as yours. Although failure seems inevitable, we did not fail, but you failed. Therefore, this is not a military victory, but must be called a victory of the people's will. In this battle, the bodies you left on the battlefield numbered at least 20,000. We buried them with tears in our eyes. During your retreat, fearing pursuit by the National Army, you desperately fled, with blood gushing from your mouths and noses, collapsing on the roadside everywhere. What a tragic picture this is! I cannot help but ask, who killed them? I press my heart and ask myself, if the war is for my personal desires or the private interests of a few people, then I killed them. I am the greatest sinner, and I should suffer divine punishment. If they are under your wrong leadership, engaging in rebellion and harming the country and the people, then you killed them. You should be condemned at night when everyone is quiet and punished by the people of the whole country. Now it is indeed at a turning point. After a year of bloody lessons, you should be alert, re-examine your policies, and re-study your lines. A political party representing the people, when deciding on policies, should always ask the people what they hate the most and what they need the most. What the people hate the most today is the destruction of transportation and endless wars, and what they need the most is peace, stability, recuperation, and recovery. Although you have always promoted democracy, the people do not want war, but you insist on creating war. The people are afraid of poverty, but you insist on using extreme poverty as the capital to expand the war. What kind of democracy is this? You have repeatedly vilified the government. The government has merit and prestige in the hearts of the people, which cannot be shaken by any slander. Even if the government has some shortcomings today that need to be reformed, the people hate you for creating war, hate you for destroying transportation, and hate you for turning over and settling accounts. Compared with demanding that the government carry out some reforms, the importance and urgency of these things are almost incomparable. Because the latter is just a comparison between good and bad, while the former is a difficult situation where the people cannot survive. The people's minimum requirement today is to be able to live in peace and stability and not expect to turn over and risk their lives in your wars. The impact of some of the government's shortcomings on people's lives is simply one to twenty thousand times less than the suffering and death you inflict on the people by destroying transportation and exhausting military resources. Isn't this realistic? Isn't this clear? How can the people sympathize with you and support you? We might as well make another assumption. If you have the power to overthrow the current government in one fell swoop and establish your new regime, whether or not the people agree with your policies, they can still obtain stability. But the military force you rely on to rebel is not enough to realize this ambition. According to your own propaganda, it is estimated that it will take at least ten years. At present, you hope to create a situation of armed separatism to continue the struggle. This proves that you are prepared to continue the struggle for ten years and ten years of war. In the struggle and war, the existing people of all classes will either die in the chaos of war or die of starvation, causing them to be completely destroyed. How can the people sympathize with your ten years of struggle? After the war, there will be no villages everywhere, so how can you realize your goals? Therefore, your ten-year war plan has absolutely no possibility of being realized. Take the recent facts as an example. The National Army of this war zone is considered by you to have the fewest personnel, the worst weapons, and the weakest combat power, but you were defeated in Baotou, again in Datong, and three times in Jining. How can you fight against other elite National Army forces? Perhaps you are prepared to continue guerrilla warfare in the mountains in case separatism fails. But civil war and the war against Japan are completely different. The war against Japan was the unanimous demand of the people, so you can use the name of resistance against Japan to deceive the people into protecting you. (To be continued)

### The Crime of the Nanjing Massacre is Being Intensified; Three Powerful Witnesses Escaped Death

[Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th, This Newspaper] On the eve of the arrival of Tani Hisao, the chief culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, in the capital, the work of investigating the enemy's crimes in Kyoto is being intensified, so that the investigation results can be reported to the Ministry of National Defense as soon as possible for use as evidence when trying war criminals. So far, of the more than 2,500 cases investigated, three are the most tragic, and the victims have survived death, which is the most powerful personal witness. The first case involved the most victims. At that time, 900 people were tied to the execution ground by the Japanese invaders. Under the sweeping fire of four machine guns, very few were spared. Although the general public who were harmed were spared, they were also very frightened. In the case, more than 50 Chinese people were killed by the Japanese invaders with machine guns, rifles, and bayonets. Bai Hongen, who was spared at the time, still has bullet marks behind his left ear and is deaf in both ears and lives in extreme poverty. The victim in the third case was a pregnant woman with six months of pregnancy who was stabbed 33 times for refusing to be raped, and the six-month-old baby was also stabbed. Today, I often feel pain in my family when it rains. These bad deeds were mostly done by the Nakajima Unit, and Tani Hisao was the commander who entered the city at that time, so the people of the capital hope that this blood feud can be washed away as soon as possible.

### Special Envoy Marshall Visits Foreign Minister Wang to Expand the Scope of the Five-Person Group Talks; The Special Envoy is Exchanging Opinions with Both Parties

[Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th, This Newspaper] Special Envoy Marshall came late and always went to Chushan on Friday, but this is an exception, which may be related to the expectation of Zhou Enlai's return to Beijing. At 11:00 a.m., Special Envoy Marshall arrived at the Ninghai Road residence and talked with the special envoy for an hour. Their conversation still focused on the National-Communist negotiations, but there were no new plans. They are still hoping that Zhou Enlai will return to Beijing as soon as possible.

He left at 7:40 p.m. The content of the conversation is unknown.

[Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th, This Newspaper] After visiting Special Envoy Marshall in the morning, the special envoy also visited the Communist people, talked for a while, and did not return to the embassy. This is the highest expression of civilian spirit. At 4:00 p.m., Wang Bingnan visited Ambassador Stuart, reviewed the situation of the talks in recent days, and studied the disputes between the three and five people, but there were no new opinions. As for the Soviet Ambassador's visit to Ambassador Stuart yesterday, it was purely a diplomatic visit and had nothing to do with this. Chuan Jianbo told reporters: "Don't be nervous," and some people spread the rumor that the political negotiations will be moved to Shanghai. Chuan said that this matter is impossible.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] According to reliable sources, the American mediator in the political negotiations is now definitely considering the possibility of expanding the scope of the informal five-person group talks with Zhou Da. Special Envoys Ma and Si Nan still believe that the political negotiations should first be handled by the five-person group, Jiang Shou. Currently, Special Envoy Si is constantly exchanging opinions with representatives of the government and the Communist Party on expanding the scope of the negotiations.

[Dispatch from Associated Press, Ben Tao News] Chen Shenkang, a spokesman for the Central Nanjing Delegation in Shanghai, declared this evening: Zhou Enlai plans to put forward a final proposal, reconvening the three-person meeting.

### Bandit Activity Still Rampant in Various Areas

### Fourth Administrative District of Zhejiang Province Decides to Implement Cooperative Farms, Divided into Public Land System and Private Land Joint Operation System

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] The Fourth Administrative District of Zhejiang Province has decided to implement cooperative farms this year. According to Commissioner Li Chu Kuang of the district, speaking to this newspaper's reporter, these farms are divided into two types: the public land system and the private land joint operation system. The former is for tenant farmers, and the latter is for landlords and self-cultivating farmers. Two or more farms will be established in each county, and the entire district can establish about twenty small farms of more than one hundred acres each. Farmers do not have to join with all their land and property and can retain a portion for free production. Those who have joined will still mark their boundaries to avoid disputes when they withdraw. Because the government can supply seeds and agricultural tools to facilitate their labor and production, Commissioner Li observes that many farmers will participate. Currently, Li is actively applying to the provincial government and the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan for various seeds and small agricultural machinery to put Zhejiang agriculture on the path of collective production.

### Xie Yingzhou Discusses the Work of Adjudicating Traitors, Which Can Be Concluded Within Six Months; Suggestions from the Shanghai City Council Should Be Valued

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Xie Yingzhou, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, told this newspaper's reporter on the 20th: The seven measures for reporting traitors proposed by the Shanghai City Council have been seen in the newspapers, and the government will value the suggestions of representative bodies. It is said that the authorities have always been very cautious about the work of adjudicating traitors. Those with solid evidence have mostly been tried. The cases that have been concluded so far are mostly complex and require evidence to be collected from various places. Because the work of adjudicating traitors is even more important than ordinary cases, a hasty decision cannot be made. Xie went on to talk about the work of adjudicating traitors in various places, believing that the general situation is still satisfactory. For example, the Capital High Court has tried many traitor cases since April and May of this year, and other places such as Shanghai, Beiping, and Guangzhou are also actively proceeding. According to Xie's estimate, the work of adjudicating traitors can be concluded within six months. Regarding the amnesty, the procedures have been completed, and only the date of implementation by the government is awaited, but traitors and corruption are not included in the amnesty.

Editorial

### Churchill Advocates Franco-German Cooperation

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered a speech at the University of Zurich in Switzerland the day before yesterday, advocating depriving Germany of all opportunities to rearm, but that France and Germany should reconcile and build a European alliance based on Franco-German cooperation. He said: "The first step in rebuilding Europe must be through Franco-German cooperation. Only in this way can France restore its leadership on the European continent; without a great Germany, Europe cannot be revived."

Although Churchill has now retired from politics and is living in Switzerland, his remarks and proposals are still valued by various countries because of his personal prestige. It is expected that Churchill's speech will once again cause a great stir in the opinion circles of various countries. In March of this year, Churchill delivered a speech in Fulton, USA, hoping that world peace in the future could be established on the basis of friendly cooperation between the two major victorious countries, Britain and the United States, which aroused criticism from opinion circles in various countries around the world. In particular, the Soviet newspapers criticized Churchill for harboring anti-Soviet conspiracies. This time Churchill's speech will inevitably arouse repercussions from various countries again.

Standing in the position of a third party, we can calmly analyze the current political situation in Europe and know that in order to create peace and order on the European continent, the feud between France and Germany should indeed be resolved rather than perpetuated. From the perspective of Easterners, this is especially true. For the sake of European peace, and also for the future of France, France should not use retaliatory means against Germany or make various excessive and harsh demands on Germany. Otherwise, the German people will never eliminate the psychology of "revenge," and how can the cycle of revenge and war be ended? Even more fundamentally, there can be no talk of expecting France and Germany to cooperate in building a framework for a European alliance. Humans are rational animals and are most able to accept the lessons of history. No one can deny that no matter what harsh conditions France imposes on Germany, even if it can bind Germany temporarily, making it unable to recover, it is not a once-and-for-all solution. After a decade or so, the bound will harbor resentment and seize the opportunity to take revenge one day. Far-sighted politicians in France will definitely be able to see the advantages and disadvantages. Taking China and Japan as an example, the oppression, invasion, trampling, and humiliation that China has suffered from Japan are truly innumerable. During the war, the Chinese people hated the Japanese to the extreme. However, once the war ended, China, thinking of the long-term plan for peace in the Far East, still adopted a magnanimous attitude and did not adopt a retaliatory policy towards Japan. Therefore, in the eyes of the Chinese people, it is believed that there should be no irreconcilable hatred between France and Germany. Moreover, this kind of national feud, if it exists for a long time, will cause both sides to try to retaliate at the expense of causing war. The incompatibility and mutual hostility between France and Germany have caused countless wars in the past century. Therefore, we also believe that if European peace can be built on a solid foundation, then the reconciliation between France and Germany is an indispensable factor.

However, Churchill has delivered several speeches in the past year, one in the United States, advocating Anglo-American cooperation; another in France, advocating an Anglo-French alliance; and this time in Switzerland, advocating Franco-German cooperation. Putting these proposals together, one cannot help but suspect that Churchill has the intention of organizing a Western bloc to resist the Soviet Union. We not only hope for international peace, but also hope that the United Nations countries, especially the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, can work together to create world peace. Therefore, we cannot casually agree with any plan to organize a bloc to resist another bloc in the international arena. Is there such an intention in Churchill's speech? It is indeed a question worth discussing.

### Why Should Temples and Monks Misunderstand?

Several temples and five or six hundred monks in the city went to the City Council in a united group to petition. It is recorded that at the City Council meeting on the 17th, the "Requesting the City Government to Allocate Office Buildings for Autonomous Organizations to Facilitate the Implementation of Autonomy" was passed, in which the second of the five measures stipulated "appropriating or borrowing temples and public buildings," which caused unease among the monks. It was found that in the City Council session, Councilors Wang Song and Zheng Yanyan had strongly argued for the cancellation of the word "appropriating," and it was only after it was revised to "appropriating or borrowing" that it was passed. This case has unexpectedly caused a misunderstanding among the monks.

We sympathize with autonomous organizations that do not have office buildings; autonomous organizations cannot arbitrarily use other people's private property simply because they do not have office buildings. Of course, there are many private properties in temples, and there are managers, but there are also some temples, either built with public funds at the beginning, or by their nature, originally built as public property by the local area, which should not be generalized. As Councilor Wang said in the council, "The general public has its own intentions when building temples, and public buildings also have their uses; autonomous organizations should not apply for appropriation," but after the City Council revised it to appropriation or borrowing, there will be no more abuses. If this temple originally belonged to the local public property, or has now become a ruined ancestral hall or deserted house, then it would not be impossible to temporarily allocate it to the public to make it useful. If it is entirely private property, then there is complete freedom to allow or not allow borrowing, and there is absolutely no fear of usurpation or misuse. There is even less talk of infringing on property rights or hindering legal interests. If the monks of the temple can carefully distinguish, why panic?

As for the nature of temples, it is not limited to Buddhist temples, but also includes other places of religious worship, such as Christian churches and Muslim mosques. Such a provision may cause disputes. In our view, it is also an exaggeration. It is found that freedom of religion is originally a basic human right, which is recorded in the national constitution. Freedom of religion includes the freedom to build and maintain buildings necessary for religious belief. Unless it is a religion that harms good customs, freedom of religion is not deprived. Temples are places that religious believers must go to, so there is a reason to prohibit the closure of temples. Churches, mosques, etc., are even less relevant. It should be noted that what the government authorities previously announced to prohibit was the protection of temples, not the unauthorized destruction of statues or the closure of temples, but not the prohibition of appropriating or borrowing public temples to run undertakings beneficial to the public, and even less involves the basic rights of freedom of belief for all religious believers. If it is said that temples are only for worship and not for other uses, then since the Republic of China, borrowing Buddhist halls to run schools has been common everywhere, and the establishment of cultural and educational undertakings or ordinary commercial markets in local temples, Confucian temples, Yue Fei temples, Guan Yu temples, etc., is also seen at any time. Why is it that only the local autonomous organizations cannot borrow them for temporary use? In short, property belonging to the public can be appropriated, and property belonging to private individuals can only be borrowed after obtaining consent. In this way, it has nothing to do with the sovereignty of the temples, and the monks do not need to worry about their houses being seized. Clearly, the draft resolution has the word "borrowing," so even if the monks who are empty of all four elements insist that the temple is "already owned," their property rights have not been shaken in the slightest, why is there such a strong attachment and panic? Master Taixu Gong, according to the case, is an intelligent person in the Buddhist world, and his understanding must be extraordinary. He must have given good advice with foresight.

### The Course of the Qiantang River Suddenly Changes, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Base is Destroyed

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou Correspondence] The river channel of the Qiantang River between Hangzhou and Haining is tortuous and shaped like a mountain peak. The peak is the Sibao and Wubao areas of Hangzhou. Every spring, the mountain water flows from west to east, and the tide flows from east to west, meeting at the peak, causing the river embankment in that section to be destroyed and flooded year after year. This autumn, the river flow changed course, and the sand fields on the south bank increased frequently. The tide surged violently, pounding the northern part day and night, causing most of the earthen embankment, about several miles long between Sibao and Wubao, to collapse. On the 14th, a section of the Yangzihao area of Wubao had just been completely rescued by the Executive Yuan mobilizing the masses. Unexpectedly, after days of autumn rain, a crack appeared again in the repaired area. The river water in a section of Kunlian Sibao and Wubao actually rushed to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. The road base, about ten feet high, finally collapsed in the rain on the 19th. The crack extends to eight zhang, and part of it has sunk. If repairs are not carried out urgently, the crack in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway will become irreparable.

Correction

In yesterday's first edition of "Foreign Minister Wang Discusses the Process of Attending the Peace Conference," due to an error in the telegraph code, "peace treaties with Axis satellite countries can be signed within the year" was mistakenly rendered as "peace treaties with Germany and Japan can be signed within the year." Also, yesterday's first edition headline "Increasing Revenue Will Benefit Reducing Expenditure" was a mistake for "Reducing Expenditure Will Benefit Increasing Revenue." These errors are hereby corrected.

### U.S. President Supports Byrnes, Demands Wallace's Resignation, Statement That Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged

Wallace Can Freely Express Opinions as a Private Citizen

Byrnes Truman Wallace

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco 20th Extra Broadcast: President Truman has announced that he has requested Wallace to resign, and said that he absolutely supports Byrnes' foreign policy, which has not changed.

[Our Dispatch] Paris 20th Urgent Broadcast Washington Dispatch: President Truman made the announcement requesting Wallace's resignation at a press conference today. Truman stated that the U.S. government should be united on foreign policy. It is regrettable to request Wallace's resignation, but Wallace will surely be more comfortable when he exercises his right to express his views as a private citizen. Truman then reiterated that the foreign policy jointly decided by Congress, the President, and the State Department is still in effect, and henceforth no government official can publicly express dissenting statements on the established foreign policy.

[Reuters Washington 30th Dispatch] President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes, who is currently in Paris, exchanged views on the Wallace affair via teletypewriter for 20 minutes yesterday. It is reported that the President will soon issue a declaration on foreign policy. It is heard that Byrnes' concern about the Wallace affair has not diminished due to President Truman's temporary dissuasion of Wallace from speaking. He felt that the President should issue a clear statement to show that he supports Byrnes or Wallace, in order to completely eliminate the current state of unease.

[United Press Washington 19th Dispatch] It was learned today that Commerce Secretary Wallace has stated that unless President Truman allows him to discuss foreign policy, he has refused to participate in the Democratic Party's congressional election campaign. It is reported that when Truman and Wallace met on Wednesday, President Truman asked the Commerce Secretary to continue giving speeches, but limited the discussion to domestic issues. However, Wallace refused to limit the scope of his speeches.

### Wallace's Speech Leans Left, Churchill's Speech Leans Right, Same Motive, Different Results, Both Admit Crisis of Conflict with the Soviet Union

[Reuters London 19th Dispatch] Churchill delivered a speech at the University of Zurich in Switzerland today, advocating the establishment of a United States of Europe based on French-German cooperation. It is expected that this speech will cause a great uproar in London and around the world, no less than the speech delivered by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wallace a week ago. Observers here believe that Churchill's speech is an extreme proposition for the foreign policy of Western democracies today. Wallace advocated that the Soviet Union should not be treated harshly, while Churchill advocated that France and Germany should join hands and cooperate with Britain and the United States to establish a strong group to resist the Soviet Union. Churchill's intention is to push the current foreign policy of Bevin and Byrnes further to the right, which is the opposite of Wallace's attempt to push it to the left. However, Churchill's speech will not put the British government in a very difficult position, because Churchill is the leader of the opposition party, which is very different from Wallace, who is a current cabinet member. Churchill's proposition of "rebuilding Germany in time, lest it be too late" is very different from Bevin's proposition. The leftists of the British Labour Party will no longer accuse Bevin of following in Churchill's footsteps, so Bevin's position in the Labour Party can be strengthened as a result.

### Churchill Returns to England

[Our Dispatch] Paris 20th Broadcast London Dispatch: Churchill and his wife and daughter arrived at Biggin Hill Airport at 3:30 p.m. by Swiss plane. This is different from Wallace's speech, which intended to split the Democratic Party and weaken Byrnes' position. The central idea of Churchill's speech is simply to declare that cooperation with the Soviet Union is impossible. Observing from the position of an outsider, someone as experienced as Churchill would certainly know that advocating that Germany should restore its leading position in Europe at this time would inevitably arouse great suspicion from the Soviet Union. The motive of both Churchill's and Wallace's speeches is to acknowledge the danger of conflict with the Soviet Union, and the two people's conclusions on how to prevent it are different.

### French People Quite Shocked

[Reuters Paris 19th Dispatch] When the evening newspaper published Churchill's speech in Zurich, advocating that France and Germany should join hands to rebuild the European family, most readers felt extremely shocked. The French government has not yet commented, but private conversations among senior officials have expressed doubt about Churchill's proposal. Some political figures also believe that it is intended to prevent Germany from joining the Soviet Union. Communists say this is another attempt to establish an anti-Soviet Western bloc.

### Interlude at the Peace Conference Due to the Issue of Closing Windows, Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Reach "Compromise"

[Reuters Paris 19th Dispatch] There was an interesting interlude at today's meeting of the Trieste Sub-Committee of the Paris Peace Conference.

After a few words between Vyshinsky and Bebler, a "compromise" was reached, and the window was half open and half closed.

### Issue of Italian-Yugoslav Border and Trieste Port Remains as per Four-Power Resolution, Various Amendments Rejected

[United Press Paris 20th Dispatch] The Peace Conference today upheld the agreement of the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on the Italian-Yugoslav border and the periphery of the future Free Territory of Trieste. The Italian Political and Territorial Committee of the Peace Conference repeatedly voted down every effort to amend the border. The four powers remained true to their obligations and voted against any amendments, even if the amendments contained the original intention of the four powers. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj insisted on having his previous statement that Yugoslavia would never sign a treaty it considered "unfair" recorded in the committee's minutes. The committee voted 11 times on suggestions to change the periphery of the internationalized free zone of Trieste, rejecting them 13 to 5 in all but one vote. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, and Ukraine sided with Yugoslavia, while Abyssinia and Belgium abstained. South Africa suggested expanding the Trieste area to include Italian cities such as Pola. Amendments proposed by Byelorussia and Yugoslavia would have shifted the Italian-Yugoslav border further west into Italy and expanded the free territory area to the edge of the Trieste region. Czechoslovakia, in order to avoid a deadlock, proposed establishing a sub-committee to seek a "stable solution," but it was rejected by a vote of 10 to 7.

### Security Council to Handle Accusation Against Greece

Three Different Proposals

[Agence France-Presse Lake Success 19th Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council continued its meeting today. U.S. Representative Johnson proposed an investigation into the border disputes and international minority issues in northern Greece. He said that a formal proposal on this matter would be submitted after the Security Council discusses Ukraine's accusation against Greece. According to the Security Council's handling of the Greek issue, it is currently encountering three different proposals: (1) Australia proposed that Ukraine's accusation be rejected because it has a political effect. (2) The Soviet Union proposed that the Security Council declare that most of Ukraine's accusations have been proven to be true, and based on this, make certain demands on Greece. (3) The Netherlands proposed that the Security Council urge the governments of Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia to make their best efforts to stop the disputes along the northern Greek border.

### International Labor Conference Opens in Canada

### Intelligence on Disarmament in Occupied Japan, U.S. and Soviet Union Refuse to Provide to Each Other

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo 20th Dispatch] The U.S. demanded that the Soviet Union provide information on disarmament in its occupied area of Japan, but the Soviet Union has not complied. The U.S. representative also stated that he was unwilling to provide the Soviet Union with information on the areas controlled by the Allied Headquarters. The U.S. and Soviet representatives had a heated debate on this issue at the meeting of the Four-Power Control Committee for Japan on the 18th of this month. At the morning meeting that day, Soviet representative Tretyakov spoke, suspecting that the United States was using the Japanese Repatriation Bureau (the reorganized former Army and Navy Ministry) to spy on information about the Soviet Union's military preparations in the Far East. He also demanded an explanation as to why Japan's military capabilities and intelligence were being kept secret by the Americans. The chairman of the Control Committee, U.S. representative Acheson, reported on the repatriation situation in Japan and the work of the Repatriation Bureau, but Tretyakov expressed dissatisfaction with this report and insisted on knowing the "destruction and construction" of Japanese naval bases and coastal defense works. Acheson believed that this was not referring to the peaceful construction activities being carried out in Japanese ports, and refused to continue the discussion. He replied angrily: There is absolutely no question of Japanese naval base construction at this time. In short, the Soviet Union will not be able to obtain any detailed information on the disarmament situation in the area controlled by the Allied Headquarters, just as the Soviet Union itself does not want to provide information on its controlled areas such as Sakhalin Island and northern Korea. The Allied Headquarters has requested the Soviet authorities to provide this information five times, but has not received it. The United States has had to retaliate by refusing to provide information as well.

### China and Japan Plan to Exchange Prices with Each Other

[Reuters Tokyo 19th Dispatch] The Chinese delegation to Japan said: China is studying Japan's economy in order to know within what range Japan can exchange industrial products with China for raw materials. This is part of a plan for mutual prosperity between China and Japan. It is not yet completed.

### Turks Love Cats, Not Dogs, Cats Fill the Streets, Stray Dogs are Expelled

[United Press Istanbul, Turkey 19th Dispatch] Cats here are very numerous, more than in other cities. There are no statistics, but from what can be seen, cats respectfully occupy the streets, fill the gutters, and block the stone steps of apartment buildings, which proves that Istanbul has become a paradise for cats. The reason is that there are too few dogs. Thirty years ago, the local authorities expelled stray dogs to a barren island in the Sea of Marmara. Without food on the barren island and no access to the mainland, these dogs had no choice but to cannibalize each other. Presumably, the last remaining dog also starved to death. Now there are probably no dogs left on the island, only the name "Dog Island." Istanbul has become a world of cats. The few dogs that remain are careful and humble, so as not to offend the cats. According to the city's dog management department's report: 137 stray dogs were "disposed of" in June, while only 7 cats were disposed of. It can be seen from this that Turks do not like dogs, but cherish cats.

### U.S. Army and Navy Departments Deny Planning to Attack the Soviet Union, Wallace's Remarks Have Absolutely No Basis

[Agence France-Presse Washington 19th Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal jointly sent a letter to President Truman, solemnly denying Commerce Secretary Wallace's assertion that American military thinkers advocated using a "preemptive" means against the Soviet Union. The contents of this letter were released by the White House last night. It stated, "Secretary Wallace's letter to the President on August 23 was reprinted in this morning's newspapers. The claim that an attack would be launched against the Soviet Union before it possessed the atomic bomb has absolutely no basis. There is no such idea in the United States, whether in the Department of the Army or in the Department of the Navy. We all know that the responsible officers of the Army and Navy have never made such a claim, nor have they planned an attack on the Soviet Union policy or plan."

### Ambassador Represents Head of State in International Law, Japanese Emperor Should Be Held Accountable for His Crimes

Defense Lawyer for Former Ambassador to Germany Oshima Said that Lieutenant General Kusaba Died Suddenly En Route to Japan

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo 20th Dispatch] American lawyer Kleinhan, who came here from Nuremberg, is serving as the legal defense lawyer for Japanese war criminal and former Ambassador to Germany Oshima Hiroshi. Kleinhan stated in court yesterday: The International Tribunal cannot try Oshima if it does not try the Japanese Emperor, because according to international law, an ambassador represents the head of state of a country, and even after being dismissed from his post, the ambassador is still protected by diplomatic privilege. Any attack directly against the ambassador is considered an attack on the head of state. Since the court is based on international law, it should respect this privilege. If the Japanese Emperor is innocent, then Oshima is also innocent. If Oshima is guilty and should be tried, then the Japanese Emperor should also be tried. Although Kleinhan's words were reasonable, the court rejected this appeal and decided that Oshima would remain in the defendant's seat awaiting trial.

[United Press Tokyo 20th Dispatch] The Soviet prosecution team of the International Tribunal informed the U.S. authorities today that Japanese Lieutenant General Kusaba, who was escorted here from the eastern three provinces of China to testify in court, was found to have died of poisoning. If it was not suicide, it must have been assassination, and an autopsy will be performed immediately. It is heard that the Soviet Union brought 20 Japanese people from the eastern three provinces for custody, the same as when Puyi came. Kusaba was one of the 20 people. The origin of this person is unknown. The U.S. intelligence department received a report and immediately began investigating.

[Kaizo Publishing Tokyo 20th Dispatch] The prosecutor of the International Tribunal first presented the Japanese Privy Council's review report on the conclusion of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact today. It was submitted to the chairman of the Privy Council, Hiranuma, by Vice Chairman Arai Kentaro five days before the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, that is, on November 20, 1936. It stated that the Soviet Union had strengthened its national power through two five-year plans, and had prepared vast military equipment in the Far East, and adjusted diplomatic relations between neighboring countries in Europe. Its international position was gradually consolidated. The Comintern, which depended on the Soviet Union, expanded its influence in China, Mongolia, and Manchuria. The biggest problem currently encountered in Japanese diplomacy is to be wary of the Soviet Union and the Comintern. On July 28, 1937, the German Foreign Minister sent a secret telegram to the German Ambassador to Japan, expressing dissatisfaction that after the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese army continued to occupy northern China, hindering China's unification and promoting the spread of communism. The above-mentioned German policy changed after the fall of Nanjing and turned into full support for Japan's invasion of China. The Sino-Japanese War entered a new stage. Germany was absolutely neutral in the first stage of the Sino-Japanese War.

### City Budget and Mayor's Submissions to be Decided at Today's General Assembly; Passing the Elimination of Wharf Theft and Unification of Water Police Authority; The General Assembly Adjourned to Next Monday

(Report from our newspaper) Today, the City Council will hold its 19th meeting in the morning to discuss the city budget and the Mayor's submissions. The issue of horse racing will also be brought up for discussion at the general assembly, and a lively atmosphere is expected. The general assembly will continue to discuss proposals in the afternoon.

The first general assembly of the first City Council was originally scheduled to end today. However, due to the large number of proposals still to be discussed, Speaker Pan proposed yesterday, and the general assembly passed a resolution to extend the adjournment to next Monday (the 23rd). There will be a break on Sunday afternoon due to lack of space at the venue.

Furthermore, Mayor Mi's report on governance was passed by the general assembly yesterday, with each group nominating one representative for joint review. The representatives are: Zhu Wende from Group 1, Jiang Pingfan from Group 2, Lu Shidao from Group 3, Wang Xianqing from Group 4, Wang Zhuyi from Group 5, Tong Hangbai from Group 6, Shui Xiangyun from Group 7, Pang Jingzhou from Group 8, Xu Yongzuo from Group 9, and Tao Baichuan from Group 10.

Yesterday morning, the City Council held its 16th meeting, starting at 9:40 AM, with 92 councilors in attendance. After the Secretary-General read the minutes of the previous meeting, Proposals Jing (Police) Numbers 1 to 6 were discussed, and finally, one temporary motion was passed.

The temporary motion was proposed by Yang Guanbei and others: "To unify the authority of the water police to specialize responsibilities and eliminate theft. 1. Telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to clearly stipulate that the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department is specifically established for customs anti-smuggling purposes. Except for investigating and seizing smuggled goods that evade taxes, it shall not overstep its authority to handle water theft and violations of police regulations. 2. Telegraph the government to clearly order the cancellation of the patrolman companies under the jurisdiction of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department to eradicate the hidden dangers of harboring dirt and accepting bribes. 3. Within the Shanghai urban area, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Water Division should be fully responsible for the water surface security, exercising its authority, and all necessary personnel and equipment, such as patrol boats, should be fully equipped."

Yang Guanbei first explained that the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department was originally responsible for anti-smuggling work, and water theft and violations of police regulations were all the responsibility of the Water Police Division. However, the Executive Yuan did not understand this historical truth and ordered the Jianghai Customs Police Department to also manage water security, resulting in the Huangpu River, which belongs to the Shanghai Municipal Government, becoming a "concession." After participating in the Shanghai Port Affairs Committee, I learned that the crux of the failure to eliminate wharf theft lies in this. Because of the division of responsibilities, neither the water nor land sides cooperate, and the port becomes a "no-man's land," with no one taking responsibility, while theft is organized and carried out on a large scale. Therefore, it is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to transfer the water security work on the Huangpu River to the Shanghai Municipal Government for specialized management. Councilors Wang Yansong, Wang Xianqing, and others continued to explain. Finally, it was passed with 94 votes.

Proposal Jing (Police) Number 6 is closely related to the temporary motion. The proposal is to establish a special wharf inspectorate to supervise the customs and water police administration. Wang Jian'e also proposed measures such as the municipal government handling wharf police affairs, improving the service ethics of the water police, and unifying the uniforms of wharf workers. The general assembly resolved to send it to the municipal government for reference.

Volunteer Police - Strengthen Training

Proposal Jing (Police) Number 1: To strengthen the training of volunteer police and establish a militia to increase security forces. It was passed by the general assembly with supplementary review opinions, summarized into the following three measures: 1. Volunteer police are organized according to laws and regulations to supplement the inadequacy of police forces. They should be strengthened through training and expanded in suburban areas, equipped with appropriate firearms to ensure distribution and protection. 2. Since the militia is organized by clear order from the central government and belongs to the scope of autonomy, it should be handled in accordance with the law. 3. The "Bao Wei Tuan" (defense corps) no longer has a legal basis and does not need to be restored.

Proposal Jing (Police) Number 2 was supplemented and passed. The revised proposal is "To strengthen fire-fighting equipment and improve the service ethics of fire-fighting personnel to emphasize fire administration and ensure safety." Councilors attached great importance to the service ethics of firefighters. Yuan Zhaoxin said: "Some time ago, a hardware store on Huade Road caught fire. When the flames were raging, the firefighters tried to extort 40 million yuan from the proprietress." He urged the authorities to pay attention to this. There are a total of five measures. The fourth measure is "Include 1 billion National Currency in this year's municipal budget specifically for supplementing fire-fighting equipment. The municipal government should subsidize the civilian-run volunteer fire brigades in the four districts of Huxi, Hubei, Pudong, and Shanghai.

Rectifying Police Discipline - Correcting the Concept of "Patrolling Catchers"

Proposal Jing (Police) Number 3, the proposal and measures were revised and passed with 78 votes. It is "To request the municipal authorities to rectify police discipline." The third measure includes "Police officers who have served in the former concessions should correct their past erroneous concept of 'patrolling catchers'." Someone suggested adding the phrase "listeners of rumors" after "patrolling catchers," because in the past, "listeners of rumors" often used fists and feet against the common people, which was very bad. Fei Shusheng expressed disagreement, saying: "Patrolling catchers or listeners of rumors are just names; there are good ones and bad ones." As a result, this measure was revised to "Police officers who have served in the former concessions should undergo intensive training to correct their erroneous concepts, and those with poor qualities should be eliminated." The first two measures are about improving the treatment and qualifications of police officers. The fourth measure is "Police officers should treat the people with a peaceful attitude. If there are cases of rudeness or extortion, the people should be encouraged to report them as much as possible. If there is abuse of power, taking advantage of the situation to protect others, or detaining the people, severe punishment should be imposed, and superiors should be held jointly responsible."

Proposal Jing (Police) Number 4 is "To request the city's police authorities to pay attention to the current reforms to be carried out in the city." The general assembly decided to send it to the municipal government for reference along with the original proposal. There are three measures: 1. Prohibit private prostitution and opium. 2. Strengthen traffic control. 3. Eliminate pickpocketing and petty theft. Female Councilor Lu Huimin said: "Private prostitution should not be mentioned in the same breath as opium. After they are banned, where should they go? They should be given ideological education like pickpockets and petty thieves." But there was no response in the general assembly.

Traces of the Enemy and Puppets - Shanghai South Gendarmerie - Quanlu Brand Cigarettes

Proposal Jing (Police) Number 5 is "To request the municipal government to issue orders to its subordinate bureaus and offices, and notify the agencies stationed in various institutions to pay attention to clearing up the traces of the enemy and puppets left in various places in this city." Zhong Yuliang took the stage to explain, his words and attitude were humorous and funny, causing laughter throughout the hall. He said: "Although this matter is small, it is of great significance. For example, the Gendarmerie of Sinan Road

Discussing Financial and Land Proposals - Exempting the Book Industry from Business Tax - Returning Civilian Farmland Occupied by the Enemy and Puppets

At the 17th meeting in the afternoon, financial and land proposals were discussed first.

Should "Second Landlords" Be Banned? Zhou Lianze believes that in the factual situation of Shanghai, "second landlords" cannot be banned, because some houses can house more than a dozen families, and the "first landlord" cannot sign contracts with each family. Therefore, what should be banned is the situation of "second landlords" demanding extra expenses. After discussion, it was revised to "The municipal government should strictly prohibit the extra demands and bad habits of 'second landlords'."

Regarding the proposal by Zhang Yiqu and Ji Hao to exempt the book industry from business tax, Li Wenjie expressed his opinion, saying that in principle he agreed, but he was afraid of affecting the municipal government's budget revenue. Jiang Jizhou believed that there was no need to worry about the budget, because the book industry is related to the national, ethnic, educational, and cultural undertakings, and the government should give it strong support. Zhang Zhongyuan and others also agreed with this idea, and it was unanimously passed without objection.

Regarding the proposal to urge the government to quickly return civilian farmland occupied by the enemy and puppets, Zhang Xuelian believed that the tone of the proposal should be strengthened. He said: "The last Provisional Council has already proposed that the municipal government earnestly handle it, but it is still the same as before. It would be best for the people to urge the mayor to do it immediately." Pang Jingzhou proposed to ask the mayor to answer on the spot whether this matter could be implemented. The mayor's attitude was very straightforward. He stood up and said: "This case refers to the civilian farmland of the airport. The Land Bureau has already been instructed to investigate. After the investigation, it can be submitted to the central government for handling. If the general assembly passes a resolution requesting the municipal government to quickly and earnestly handle it, then I will definitely handle it quickly and earnestly!" This case was passed with satisfactory applause from the councilors.

In addition, the proposals passed include: (1) There is no need to increase house rents; (2) The municipal government should earnestly build civilian villages in various districts to settle the people; (3) The Huazhong workshop left by the enemy and puppets should be converted into a civilian village; (4) Investigate the abandoned public properties in the urban area and formulate ways to create properties for implementation to make use of them; (5) Request the land authorities to facilitate the land in suburban areas that has not been surveyed and measured and the single contracts have been lost, and reissue the ownership certificates; (6) Request the land authorities to first carry out surveying and mapping in areas that have not yet completed surveying and mapping, and then carry out registration; (7) Request the land authorities to restore the method of virtual money maps for jointly owned land that cannot be divided to avoid disputes; (8) Request the land authorities to restore the pre-war collection method to shorten the time to facilitate land transactions; (9) Request the municipal government to adjust duplicate institutions and improve transfer and registration procedures to increase the efficiency of land administration.

The proposals retained include (1) Representatives from people's organizations should participate in the Housing Allocation Committee; (2) Stipulate that the original lessee of a fixed-term lease has the priority right to lease. These will be discussed together when the Housing Lease Regulations proposal of the tenth group is submitted. (3) Request the Finance Bureau to stop collecting the "Bao Tuan" (defense corps) uniform fee to lighten the burden on citizens. These will be discussed together when the budget proposal is submitted. Hanging the words "Shanghai South Gendarmerie." In the past, the enemy gendarmerie also called it the Shanghai South Team. We now see it, and we inevitably feel a little frightened. Why not use "Nanshi Gendarmerie"? At this time, he took out two packs of Quanlu brand cigarettes from his pocket and said: "Quanlu brand cigarettes are products of the enemy. After the economic goods were taken over, why not reform them? It is truly painful and shameful to profit from the enemy's brand." After he finished speaking, he gave the packs of Quanlu brand cigarettes to the speaker. Finally, the general assembly resolved to send it to the municipal government for handling.

The List of Candidates is Determined

In the council meeting the day before yesterday, it was approved to recommend that the government improve the financial situation as soon as possible, and it was decided to send 11 representatives to Beijing to petition. Yesterday morning, Speaker Pan proposed the formulated list: Xu Jiyun, Huan Yushu, Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Tao Baichuan, Jin Runxiang, Liu Jingji, Yu Zuoting, Xu Guomao, Yang Fusheng, and Wang Xianqing. After the speaker finished reading, Tao Baichuan requested to withdraw and recommended Xu Yongzuo. The speaker said: "It is not good to request to withdraw. What if everyone requests to withdraw? Let's have a vote!" As a result, the general assembly passed the original list.

Zhang Xiaosong Speaks on the Issue of Allocating Temples

Regarding the case of the City Council's autonomous organs allocating temple houses, according to a written statement issued by Zhang Xiaosong, the head of the Civil Affairs Department yesterday: "After investigating the proposal of the City Council, which was proposed by Councilors Jiang Pingfan and others, and the Review Committee of the First Group decided on various listed measures, when discussing it, I explained the current difficult situation of the autonomous organs of the city in the capacity of a nonvoting member of the city government. As for the allocation of temple houses, according to the regulations of the Supervision of Temples Ordinance, abandoned temples that are ownerless or have little management, etc., can be allocated. Therefore, the so-called allocation refers to legal allocation. The Buddhist Association of this city did not understand this point and mistakenly believed that all temples were subject to allocation, which led to the occurrence of the petition."

Police Bureau's Governance Report - Resolution Draft Passed - Emphasizing the People's Personal Freedom

The City Council passed the "Draft Resolution on the Governance Report of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau" with a majority of 87 votes yesterday morning. In terms of wording, it was organized by the General Assembly Secretariat and summarized the additional opinions of the councilors. The opinions presented in the draft are divided into nine aspects: public security, personnel, criminal, training, opium prohibition, fire protection, social customs, cityscape, and traffic. Regarding criminal matters, the issue of personal freedom was specifically raised. Because there are cases in the police stations and branches of this city where the personal freedom of the people is restricted, and the behavior is not in accordance with the law. The general assembly resolved that, henceforth, except for theft and kidnapping cases where investigation is necessary, and current offenders who must be arrested immediately, in ordinary criminal cases, unless there are serious circumstances and it is deemed that the crime is true and there is a risk of flight, no detention should be imposed. They should be ordered to directly sue to the court. Even if it is deemed necessary to summon them for questioning and release them on bail, it should be transferred to the court for handling at any time. Regarding violations of police regulations, they should be handled as soon as they arrive. As for the traffic problems that are currently attracting attention from all parties, it was resolved to add parking lots and re-divide the driving areas according to the pre-war method and strictly inspect the vehicles.

Workers of Shanghai Cement Factory Petition - The General Assembly Asks the Authorities to Resolve it Reasonably

Yesterday morning, five minutes before the adjournment of the Council meeting, Speaker Pan asked Zhu Xuefan to report on the reception of the petition of workers from the Longhua Huashang Shanghai Cement Factory. Zhu said: "I was ordered to receive all the petitioning workers, and now this problem is very serious. The authorities of the Longhua Huashang Shanghai Cement Factory posted a notice of shutdown on the 17th (Sunday) when the workers were not working in the factory. On the morning of the 18th, when the workers went to work, the police were densely stationed at the factory gate, and two red police cars were parked with machine guns, preventing the workers from entering the factory. Fortunately, the workers were quite rational and did not cause any accidents. We know that in order to maintain social stability, the government has already issued a clear order: workers shall not strike or slack off at will, and factory owners shall not close factories or dismiss workers at will. This is based on the four principles of the Ministry of Social Affairs for resolving labor-management disputes and the five measures set by the mayor. I finally put forward a temporary motion: Request the Social Bureau to quickly and reasonably resolve the dispute at the Longhua Cement Factory." Finally, the general assembly passed a resolution: "Request the municipal government to order the Social Bureau and the Police Bureau to handle it according to law."

Passing Health Proposals

Proposal No. 1 on Health: After discussion and revision, the following five measures were passed to improve general environmental hygiene: (1) Please move the autopsy site of Tongren Fuyuan Hall to the suburbs or merge it with the Jiaozhou Road autopsy site. (2) Please move the temporary coffin storage sites in the urban area to the suburbs, and order the families of the coffins in the current coffin storage sites to bury them, otherwise the Health Bureau will choose a place to bury them deeply, but a sign must be erected. For exposed corpses and coffins in the suburbs, they should be ordered to be buried on a regular basis. (3) Increase suburban pools and expand tap water pipes. (4) Please increase the number of latrines and garbage bins in the alleys and cooperate with the district offices to supervise the Baojia heads to carry out cleanliness campaigns and inspect the cleanliness of the alleys. (5) Please strictly inspect and improve the tap water source.

Proposal No. 2 on Health: The measures to strengthen and improve the city's medical institutions were also slightly revised. The measures are to increase civilian clinics that provide free medicines in the suburban administrative districts, eliminate the malpractices of hospitals refusing to admit patients and discussing consultation fees before providing treatment for emergency cases, stipulate the consultation procedures for public and private hospitals and set up free beds, and use public vacant land and houses as much as possible to add hospitals.

Proposal No. 3, please order the municipal government to repair the dung trucks and strictly prohibit the removal of feces before 8:00 AM every morning, and prohibit the dumping of feces at will, and Proposal No. 4, please order the municipal government to thoroughly clean up the city's garbage, and Proposal No. 5, restore the suburban vegetable fields, were all passed without objection.

Proposal No. 6 on Health: After the original proposer Fan Shouyuan explained the significance of the proposal to promote the blood type testing of the city's citizens, it was resolved to send it to the Health Bureau for reference.

Real Estate Cannot Be Used as Collateral - The Banking Industry Requests Improvement

Due to time constraints, the discussion of health proposals ended here. Finally, the speaker proposed a temporary motion, which was a letter from the Banking Industry Association and the Money Industry Joint Association, stating that since real estate is inconvenient to be used as a guarantee for loans, the restoration and construction of the city's industry and commerce has suffered great resistance, and they urgently hope that there can be some improvement. The letter listed five key points. After discussion by the general assembly, it was decided to convey the fourth point, "The draft Banking Law limits the maximum period for banks to resell real estate after accepting it to only one year, which reduces the value of the excellent collateral," and the fifth point, "Banks such as China Communications and Agriculture Bank do not allow real estate to be used as collateral for funding for industry and commerce," to the central government and hand it over to the members of the delegation selected this time to petition in Beijing as one of the petition requirements.

### Outside the Racecourse: A Desolate Past, Now Golden Ground

Wu Zhilao Recounts the Past with Eloquence, Like a Dream: The Scenery of Tibet Beside Us, the Small Teahouse at Zhou Jingbang Head, Mayor Wu Believes Recovery Within Two Years is Possible

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The two-week Municipal Assembly is nearing its "finale," and councilors have been discussing the "horse racing" issue outside the assembly for over ten days. Will these "horses" "run" or not? The decision will be made today? To ensure that everyone understands the truth of the racecourse before making a decision, our reporter previously interviewed Councilor Chen Cunren, known as the "racecourse history expert," who kindly shared the original history of the racecourse with the reporter for publication (as published in this newspaper on the 15th). However, fearing that the records in books might be inaccurate, he also interviewed several Shanghai scholars in the past few days and conducted a study with Mayor Wu. Here, the reporter has obtained some supplementary materials:

As a result of Councilor Chen seeking the opinion of Mr. Wu Zhihui, the elder statesman also opposes horse racing in the city center area (i.e., the current racecourse). He said: Fifty years ago, the current Tibet Road was called Zhou Jingbang, which foreigners called Route de la Protection. At that time, this road was a creek (浜). How wide was the creek? It is said that it could accommodate two large boats carrying fifty dan of rice each. Except for a three-room teahouse at the original site of the New World amusement park, both sides of the creek were completely desolate. After the "Mud City Battle," the British used a horse to enclose the land, and that horse started enclosing the land from the Middle Mud City Bridge, not the South Mud City Bridge.

When mentioning the councilors' proposal to build a "Cultural City" at the racecourse, Mr. Wu advocated that the most important thing in the Cultural City should be to establish a "vocational training school for all subjects," with classes day and night, tuition-free, and complete with all kinds of academic equipment. He said: In London, England, there are more than ten such schools, called "Polytechnic," where anyone can enroll. At the same time, he also talked about his own plan. In the second year of the Republic of China, Mr. Wu, along with Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, and others, planned to build a three-story building similar to a Cultural City next to the racecourse, from the current Jinmen Hotel to the International Hotel, for academic research. At that time, the Kuomintang headquarters had raised this sum of money, but it was disrupted by real estate developers and failed to materialize. Speaking of this, the old man smiled with great hope and said: "If the Cultural City can really be built in the racecourse, the Kuomintang's hopes in the early years of the Republic of China can also be realized."

It is said that Wu Jianzhang, the Taoist of Taiwan, lost land due to the exchange of documents

According to Zhao Jinqing, a prominent Shanghai gentleman: At that time, their Zhao family's ancestral graves were located within the racecourse. The Taoist who exchanged documents with the British, allowing them to buy land, was called Wu Jianzhang. As for the rumors that the Gu Weijun family's ancestral graves were inside, that is inaccurate.

As a result of Chen Cunren's conversation with Mayor Wu, Mayor Wu also confirmed the need to study the history of the racecourse. However, the new Sino-British treaty stipulates that the rights already obtained by the British should be respected, unless they were obtained through encroachment. According to the racecourse's reply to the mayor, "The racecourse association will comply with the city government's request to acquire the racecourse land at any time." Therefore, we feel infinite admiration for the racecourse's respect for Chinese laws. However, the problem lies in this "acquisition fee." Where can the Chinese find so much money to buy this "real estate"? If the racecourse association wants to use the current land price to exchange for suburban land, then buying a hundred pieces of land of the same size would still leave a surplus! Therefore, according to Mr. Chen's opinion: The mayor should only rely on various areas worthy of research in the past, use diplomatic methods, and negotiate with the racecourse association to recover the land. Mr. Chen has contributed several points of advice:

Proposals to Recover the Land

(1) At that time, the price the British paid for the racecourse land was indeed too low and amounted to a forced purchase. Because they bought the second racecourse (the area around the former Shui'an Company) for 49,425 taels, while they only spent 12,500 taels to buy the current racecourse land of 430 mu. It can be seen that they bought it according to the Yangjingbang regulations at the declared price but sold it at the black market price, which seems to be too unfair to the people. In Colin's "History of Shanghai," published by the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is mentioned that from 1863 to 1866, the Chinese were entangled with the British over the sale of land for three years, and the racecourse association felt very troubled. Especially for the 30 mu of land for the jumping ditch and the 41 mu of land for the training ground, the complaints were the most severe. In addition, according to Councilor Huang Zhenshi's investigation, in the twenty-first year of Guangxu, 120 homeowners who had not received land payments from the racecourse had appealed to the General Chamber of Commerce (i.e., the current Municipal Chamber of Commerce) (the case files are currently being investigated). All of these can prove that the racecourse association took advantage of the treaty and engaged in profiteering and forced purchases. This is a good basis for negotiating the recovery of land rights at a low price.

(2) In the era of the former Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Park target range was originally also a shooting range, owned by the Western Target Shooting Association. Later, the Municipal Council requested that it be changed to a public park. This precedent of "requesting" may also be adopted in negotiations.

(3) As for the issue of shares in the racecourse association, it is no longer possible to discuss it now. The property rights of the racecourse association for the past ninety years can now be definitively stated as follows: The racecourse association has a charter that is indeed very fair and strict, and this kind of organization simply does not exist in Chinese groups.

In 1896, the racecourse association elected 300 "eligible" members, and then elected seven directors from among them. If there is a vacancy for an "eligible" member, it can be filled by an application from an "ordinary" member. The level of strictness to become an "eligible" member from an "ordinary" member is more solemn than an examination. It must be reviewed by twenty members of the review committee. It can only pass if at least thirteen of these twenty people agree, and if any three people object, even if thirteen people agree, it is invalid. It can be seen that under this strict system, bad and unfair elements cannot participate.

At the same time, Article 5 of the basic charter stipulates that in the event that the racecourse is sold, the proceeds from the sale must not be divided among the 300 members, but must be used to purchase a new racecourse or sports ground. The land is unrelated to private individuals! It is unrelated to members, eligible members, or directors! It can be seen that there is a great deal of room for flexibility in negotiating the price of land acquisition!

Banning Horse Racing May Not Be Necessary, Moving It to the Suburbs Deserves Approval

Finally, Mr. Chen expressed his agreement with the third review committee's finding that "horse racing is not allowed in the city center area." Because horse racing exists in any international city, and horse racing cannot be absolutely said to be a form of gambling. In a large city like Shanghai, banning horse racing outright would be a strange story in the international press. However, in the city center area, with frequent traffic, a large population, and many places in need of parks and squares, using such a large open space for horse racing is like a huge tumor attached to the heart of Shanghai, which is very unreasonable. Therefore, there is no need to ban horse racing, but it can be moved to the suburbs.

The Municipal Assembly represents public opinion and naturally considers the people everywhere, how to make things convenient for the people, and how to seek welfare for the people. This issue is just one of the hundreds of problems that Shanghai urgently needs to solve, and we don't need to take it too seriously. However, once the highest public opinion institution decides on something, it "decides" to do it, and this major premise of whether to "do" it should not be decided casually.

According to Mayor Wu's statement outside the venue yesterday: Whether horse racing is gambling or not, we don't need to argue about it here and can ask the central government for instructions. As for the issue of recovering the racecourse, the assembly may wish to authorize the municipal government to negotiate with the racecourse association first. If the negotiations fail, then discuss the response. The land price of the racecourse cannot in fact be estimated entirely according to the adjacent undeveloped land. If the negotiations are successful, it is possible to recover it within two years.

### The Treasure Hidden on Fuxing Island Was Swallowed Up. Representatives of the Inspection Team of the Municipal Assembly Received a Secret Report

[Report from This Newspaper] It is rumored that during the enemy's puppet regime, there were gold bars worth 20 million US dollars hidden by the enemy's navy on Fuxing Island (formerly the fish market). It is said that they were swallowed up by the staff of the Fisheries Materials Storage Station of the "Administrative Relief Executive." Representatives of the Municipal Assembly participating in the investigation team received a secret report on this case yesterday.

According to the long-standing rumor, the Director-General of the Administrative Relief Executive and the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Envoy's Office have also received the secret report. According to the Fisheries Materials Storage Station of the Administrative Relief Executive: Other organizations had occupied Fuxing Island before the station took over.

### The Secret Report of Corruption in Takeovers Does Not Match the Facts

The Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Takeover Handling Work Inspection Team, based on a previous secret report that Qiu Zhongming, the battalion commander of the Shanghai Navy's First Training Camp, had engaged in corruption during the takeover, omitting items from the inventory, stealing public property, and underreporting the bid price, sent personnel to investigate. According to the investigation: (1) Regarding the portion of the original secret report alleging corruption in the takeover, regarding the use of pianos and radios in private residences, the team sent personnel to secretly investigate Qiu's private residence at No. 1 Gongyuanfang, Jiangwan Road, and found nothing. Then, Qiu replied that the piano was borrowed from the Shanghai Fleet Headquarters and was still stored in the military warehouse, and that there were accounts for the borrowed items. As for the gasoline, it was hidden and not reported by Chen Ruihuang, the former director of the training camp. After two barrels, less than 100 gallons, were discovered, they were turned over for public use. In addition, a Ford car was severely damaged in a collision with a Chevrolet sedan. It was sent to the Haida Garage for valuation and repair. Due to financial constraints and to avoid using special funds, it was planned to sell an old Ford car powered by charcoal to offset the cost. A telegram was immediately sent to the Navy Department for the record. Later, because it was sent to the Navy Automobile Factory for repair, there was no need to pay cash, and the car was not sold. Later, because the Haida Garage requested the dismantling and merging of the old car, the Ford car was sold for 3.2 million yuan. Later, because the Navy Headquarters found that it did not comply with the regulations for selling materials, it ordered its recovery and is still in negotiation. (2) Regarding the portion of the original secret report alleging the theft and sale of public property, including one iron barge and one speedboat sold to Wang Yongrui of the Sanbei Company, the team's investigation found that the bid price was indeed 16.12 million yuan, and the bid form had been sent to the Navy Headquarters for the record. It was also stated that it was sold with the permission of the Navy Headquarters. The original secret report stated that only 700,000 yuan was reported, which is not true. The team has now sent a letter to the Navy Headquarters with the results of the investigation, requesting a strict review and reply.

### A Fire at the Zhixiang Factory Caused Losses of 200 Million; The Military Uniform Industry Laments the Difficult Times

[Report from This Newspaper] A report was briefly made in yesterday's newspaper about the Zhixiang Military Uniform Factory on Dongchangzhi Road, Hongkou, having a fire and injuring people due to carelessness. It is now known that the factory recently accepted orders from the Ministry of National Defense's Quartermaster Department to manufacture various uniforms, including 4,000 cotton overcoats, 100,000 pairs of military shoes and leggings, more than 400 bolts of shoe lining fabric, and more than 300 bolts of lining fabric for 10,000 wool vests. All of these, along with the factory's entire wealth, machinery, equipment, sewing machines, etc., were destroyed in the fire, with losses estimated at over 200 million yuan. The Quartermaster Department was immediately notified and sent personnel to investigate. It was generally believed that this was a major disaster late at night and that it was likely sabotage by criminals. According to the person in charge of the military uniform industry, the industry is currently facing many difficulties. For example, each set of military uniforms is valued at 30,000 yuan, but the labor cost is only 2,000 yuan. The insurance premium is 5 percent, which is 1,500 yuan. Adding the cost of buttons and labor, it is bound to lose money. Therefore, businesses in the industry are unable to afford insurance. It is said that the huge losses suffered by the Fuxing Factory this time cannot be reimbursed.

### A Single Guest at a Small Hotel Committed Suicide by Poisoning

The center, which detains more than 300 Japanese military police, had already been standing in the open space awaiting reporting. Yao Kaibai, the deputy director of the center, accompanied them on a tour. After more than an hour of careful inquiry, 21 Japanese military police, including Usagia Kenjiro, Asahina, Tanaka Hatsuyoshi, Nagai, Mochizuki, and Hisao, were reported. The management office immediately transferred the group of war criminals to the military law department to await trial.

Ms. Qi Qian Yuhua and Lu Nianshi, comrades who suffered in the past, pointed out and questioned the enemy military police on the spot (China News Agency).

### Preliminary Hearing of Major Embezzlement in the Two Railways Bureau - The Gallery Was Packed - The Director Pretends Ignorance While His Wife Abuses Power - Yu Xiangyan Tenaciously Accuses Director Chen - The Merchant's Testimony Is Worth Noting - Demanding Money Even After the Case Was Uncovered

[Our Newspaper Report] The major embezzlement case at the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office, and the trial began yesterday in the Third Court of the Municipal Court. Because there were 36 defendants, the trial was divided into morning and afternoon sessions. In the morning, all 18 defendants were railway bureau employees, and a female employee from the Two Railways Bureau who reported the case testified in court about the process. In the afternoon, all 18 defendants (three of whom were absent) were merchants. There were as many as 22 defense lawyers, and the audience was packed. The testimonies of the defendants were quite contradictory, and the case still needs further investigation, with the possibility of new developments. The final court hearing will be held again on the morning of October 1st.

At 9:35 AM, Magistrate Meyer and the prosecutor and clerk took their seats, and the 18 defendants were brought in. Among them, 13 were in custody, and 5 were released on bail. The 18 people stood in three rows. After the prosecutor stated the main points of the indictment, Magistrate Meyer asked each of the 18 people their names, ages, places of origin, and positions, and then ordered Wang Ren·Zhang Kaiyuan·Zhu Biwen to stay for questioning first, and the others to step down.

"Director's Wife" Yu Xiangyan Questioned

The first to be questioned were the three who first collected commissions

Magistrate Meyer asked: The prosecutor's indictment says that the three of you were the first to collect commissions from the merchants? The three replied in unison: No. Clerk Wang Ren

claimed: A total of 290,000 yuan was distributed, given by the section chief. The first time was at the end of the lunar year, 120,000 yuan was given, without specifying where it came from. Zhu Biwen testified: He was a clerk in the Document Section, introduced to the Railway Bureau by Yu Xiangyan, and received a total of 290,000 yuan. Zhang Kaiyuan testified: He was a clerk in the Purchasing Section and received 290,000 yuan, distributed by the section chief, who said it was a year-end bonus. He did not collect commissions from the merchants and requested that the merchants be brought in for confrontation. Asked: In April, when the director went to Hangzhou, did the director's wife summon all of you to her home to discuss the "3-2-2-3" ratio (30% for the director, 20% for the deputy director and section chief, and 30% for the junior staff) for distributing the spoils? The three shook their heads in unison and said: No. At 10:15 AM, they were taken into custody.

The wife has the power to represent the director

Next, Zhang Bokang, the chief of the Purchasing Section, and Jing Weijun, the clerk of the Purchasing Section who delivered the inquiry forms, were brought to court. They testified that the purchasing procedure was that the Purchasing Section would obtain a completed purchase order from the Auditing Section, and then create an inquiry form based on this order. The merchants would create quotations, and then a comparison table would be created, marking the cheapest one and sending it to the director for a decision. Regarding the collection of commissions, they said: The director's wife told me that the director said it was okay to accept gifts from outside merchants. Although she had no position in the Railway Bureau, she could represent the director. I went to the director's house several times, and sometimes the director was home. When he saw me talking about collecting commissions, he would walk away. Later, Yu Xiangyan told me that the director was going to Nanjing and initially wanted 4 to 5 million yuan, so I gave the director a check for 600,000 yuan and 400,000 yuan in cash. The director said he didn't want the check and asked for the cash to be brought together. Although the director (Materials Department Director Zhang Hongtu) did not admit to wanting money, saying it was his wife's affair, logically speaking, how could he not know? They are a couple. The method of collection was not to estimate the price of goods too high, but to have the merchants extract a portion of their legal profits and give it to us. Because they hoped the official business would be handled quickly to reduce losses. The total amount paid to the director's wife was 24 million yuan. The distributed amount was 2.8 million yuan the first time, 8.6 million yuan the second time, 28 million yuan the third time, and more than 29 million yuan the fourth time, which has not been distributed and has been handed over to the police department. The first time, Zhu Biwen and Zhang Kaiyuan came and said that the director's wife wanted us to send a piano. We didn't have money, so we took 1 million from the more than 2 million sent by the merchants to send it over. After that, Yu often came to me to ask for money, saying she wanted to show respect to those above. Whether that referred to Director Chen Bozhuang is unknown. We also sent 6 million to Deputy Director Ding Houfu's office, but whether he accepted it and where the money went are unknown. A leaflet was once found at the North Station, attacking Yu Xiangyan, with a large turtle drawn on it and writing, "If you want to do business, bring money." It also attacked Director Zhang for receiving money from merchants. I didn't know it was illegal behavior because Yu used to be a lawyer. After the testimony, the court ordered him back into custody.

It's Yu Xiangyan's Turn

Yu Xiangyan was brought to court. There was a commotion in the audience. Yu followed the bailiff to the court. Yu testified: She was 31 years old, from Jiashan, graduated from Great China University, and worked as a lawyer for two years, but stopped when the Japanese army entered the concession. She used to be the chief executive of the Central Organization Department. She has been married to Zhang Hongtu for ten years and claimed that she had engaged in speculative business and that the couple's finances were independent. The magistrate suddenly asked cleverly, "I heard you have bad habits?" Yu denied it. She was also asked about her relationship with Zhang Bokang and Zhang Yunhe. She replied, "I met Zhang Bokang through my husband's introduction, and I met Zhang Yunhe when I was a prostitute." She also testified, "Zhang Yunhe said that when my husband went to Hangzhou, he often came to my house suspiciously." Her face turned red when she said this. Asked, "You directed bribery and wanted a piano. Did you know it was illegal?" She replied, "The law is based on truth. As an outsider, what qualifications do I have to direct bribery, and I never asked for a piano." She also claimed, "The cause of this case was Director Chen Bozhuang's planned attack on Zhang Hongtu. Before the case was uncovered, Director Chen had asked someone to suggest that Zhang Hongtu resign. After that, gold was discovered, attacking the Materials Department." "Did Shen Shiji go to your place after the case was uncovered?" She replied, "No." She also testified, "The Materials Department had bribed Chen Bozhuang 5 million yuan. Zhang Bokang and Ye Lianwen asked about sending oranges and cigarettes, but she didn't know the details beforehand. Zhang Bokang is Chen's confidant, and Zhang's defense lawyer was hired by Chen." When the questioning reached this point, Yu's defense lawyer requested that Chen Bozhuang be summoned to the court for questioning. The court was especially considering this. Finally, Yu testified: After the case was uncovered, she went to Director Chen's house three times. The first time, Director Chen called and asked her to go, saying that if she (Yu) came forward, she could reduce Zhang Hongtu's sentence. The second time, they were supposed to meet at a "tea drinking" place (Zhang Bokang's house), but she didn't go because she couldn't remember where it was at the time. The third time, at 8:30 PM, Chen Bozhuang expressed remorse, and he was arrested that night.

Director Zhang knew nothing?

Next, Zhang Hongtu, the director of the Materials Department, was questioned. He denied all the points Zhang Bokang mentioned. He claimed: I didn't know about this embezzlement at all. I don't think my wife participated either. I knew that purchasing materials was easy to be suspected, so I once proposed organizing a materials purchasing committee, with the participation of various department directors to jointly take responsibility, but it was not approved by the director. I graduated from a professional university, studied abroad, and worked in the mainland during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, I wanted to do some real business. I didn't know about this case beforehand. After it happened, they didn't report to me how much commission they received either. If I had known, I would have dismissed them. All I knew were administrative matters. I didn't know about the embezzlement. After the questioning, he was taken into custody.

Everyone Said It Was a Holiday Bonus

Next, Clerk Chen Jingyao was questioned and claimed: He received 890,000 yuan, given by the section chief. Staff Gu Zhenmin claimed: He received 890,000 yuan. The section chief said it was a year-end holiday bonus. Zhang Zelong, the chief clerk of the Material Purchasing Section, claimed: He received a total of 1.22 million yuan. Staff Zhu Peizong claimed: He received 890,000 yuan. Clerk Xia Dingwu claimed: He received 750,000 yuan. Staff Sun Xuesan claimed: He received 200,000 yuan. Clerk Xu Fugui claimed: He received 300,000 yuan. When they were distributed, everyone said it was a holiday bonus. In addition, Li Jie, the dispatcher who was released on bail, claimed: He received a total of 770,000 yuan. Clerk Cai Zhidao claimed: He received 700,000 yuan. Clerk Yu Peien claimed: He received 750,000 yuan. Clerk He Zuen claimed: He received 600,000 yuan. They all claimed that it was distributed three times at the end of the lunar year, the end of the solar year, and the Dragon Boat Festival, and called it a holiday bonus. It was transferred by Jing Weijun and Chen Jingyao. They didn't know it was embezzled money. They have now all returned it to the Railway Bureau Police Department.

Unwilling to Go Along with the Wrongdoing

Next, two witnesses, also the informants, Huang Ruzhen and Shen Guizhang, were brought in. Both are female employees of the bureau. Huang claimed: She was a clerk, and Jing Weijun gave her 200,000 yuan the first time. Because there was no reason, she didn't accept it. Jing then said that it was given from above and there was no need to be polite. She suspected why other sections didn't have it. Later, she talked to a relative and learned that it was a commission. She thought she should submit it to the public and shouldn't take it, so she wrote a letter and entrusted it to someone to report directly to the director. She didn't know the other things. Shen claimed: Chen Jingyao gave her 100,000 yuan. When she asked where it came from, he said it was a bonus for diligence. She was suspicious. The second time, 300,000 yuan was given to her, and he said that the Material Department's reputation was not good, and she shouldn't tell outsiders. Only then did she know everything, so she wrote a letter, attached the money, and told the director. She didn't know about other things.

After the questioning, the court ordered everyone to enter the court to sign. Before signing, Yu Xiangyan asked the clerk to open the transcript of her statement and requested to add: "I didn't go to the 'tea drinking' place the second time, so I made a subsequent appointment at Director Chen's house (Bailey South Road)." She also stated that Zhang Yunhe and she had a grudge and falsely accused her, and Zhang Bokang and Zhang Hongtu disagreed, and Zhang Hongtu had requested to transfer Zhang Bokang, thus forming a grudge. She especially emphasized that Zhang Bokang's lawyer was hired by Chen Bozhuang, and she talked incessantly for 30 minutes. After Yu signed, the court adjourned. It was already 1:30 PM.

### Fifteen Days of Questioning Business Associates in the Afternoon - Most Admitted That Jing Weijun Came to Ask for Money

At 2:10 PM, the questioning of the 18 business associates who were released on bail continued. Except for three who were absent, the 15 people waiting for questioning were Yu Zhonglu, manager of Shengchang Hardware Store, Jin Yunting, associate of Heyuan Hardware Store, Li Fenbin, associate of Yihe Hardware Store, Wu Lianqing, manager of Jiuchangxing Hardware Store, Shi Yaoting, manager of Hengfeng Hardware Store, Yang Wenli, manager of Dacheng Hardware Store, Shen Liansheng, manager of Huixin Western Clothing Store, Zhou Jinhua, manager of Yuanli Iron Store, Xu Binghong, manager of Xiangxing Yarn Head Store, Yu Yifu, manager of Daxingchang Hardware Store, Li Xingxin, manager of Liyuan Hardware Store, Wang Yunxian, manager of Xinji Electrical Materials Store, Shen Huiqing, manager of Tailai Hardware Store, and Xin Dingfu, manager of Yixin Printing Paper Store. In addition, Jing Weijun, the purchasing section clerk responsible for collecting commissions, was brought to court for confrontation.

The interrogation revealed that, except for several companies such as Jiuchang, Liyuan, Xinji, Tailai, and Yixin, which claimed that they had never paid a single penny, and Jing Weijun confirmed this, the rest admitted that Jing had taken tens of thousands to millions of yuan. However, they all denied that they had inflated prices or provided commissions. Among them, Shengchang Hardware Store gave Jing the most, reaching 3.11 million yuan. The least was Hengfeng Hardware Store, which only "borrowed" 20,000 to 30,000 yuan during the Dragon Boat Festival. The most bizarre thing was that, according to the testimony of three companies, Dacheng, Huixin, and Daxingchang, after the case was uncovered, the police department of the Railway Bureau escorted Jing Weijun to borrow money. He claimed "Please help me," and they borrowed tens to hundreds of thousands of yuan from him again.

Taking it if Offered

When questioned, Jing Weijun claimed: There were more than 100 merchants, and he couldn't remember clearly. They voluntarily sent the money. It wasn't necessary if they didn't send it. Those who borrowed were all familiar. It wasn't inflated prices. Most of them came to the office to give it to me themselves. I was ordered by the section chief to collect it, and the section chief was ordered by the director's wife to collect it. During festivals, several old customers would send it. New customers who voluntarily sent it were not refused, and I didn't know it was illegal. As for borrowing money from people, he heard that the director and section chief were going to resign, and their monthly salary in the Railway Bureau was only nearly 100,000 yuan, which was not enough to cover the expenses of more than ten people in the family, so he planned to borrow money to find another way to make a living. The interrogation was completed at 3:50 PM. The court held that further investigation was needed and would be re-examined on the morning of October 1st. Jing Weijun was returned to custody, and the merchants remained on their original bail.

### International Labor Bureau Counselor David H. Blelloch Arrives in Shanghai - Visiting Factories and Social Facilities in the City - The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Others Are Scheduled to Host a Tea Party Today

The visit of David H. Blelloch, Counselor of the International Labor Bureau, to China was at the invitation of the Ministry of Social Affairs to discuss the technical assistance that the International Labor Bureau could provide to China in establishing social insurance and employment services. Mr. Blelloch arrived in Shanghai on September 6th and went to Beijing on the 11th. On the 12th, he visited Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs and had a detailed three-hour talk. He stayed in Beijing for a total of nine days. In addition to talking separately with the heads of relevant departments of the Ministry of Social Affairs, he also visited the heads of relevant ministries and commissions and gave a public lecture at the invitation of the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union. In order to achieve the purpose of his visit to China, Mr. Blelloch plans to visit factories and various social welfare facilities in Shanghai before going to various industrial cities for a general inspection. After the inspection in various places, Mr. Blelloch will return to Beijing to conduct preliminary discussions with the Ministry of Social Affairs, and then return to the bureau to report and discuss with Acting Director-General Phelan of the bureau to send experts to China to assist the Ministry of Social Affairs and lay the foundation for social insurance and employment services.

[Another Report] Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Blelloch, accompanied by Lu Jingshi and Zhang Tiankai, representatives of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Cheng Haifeng, director of the International Labor Bureau branch, visited Chairman Xu of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Xu was out on business, and Shou Jingwei, executive director, temporarily received him. The content of the conversation revealed that Mr. Shou advocated that China's industrial and commercial circles should comprehensively plan and show the implementation of labor welfare and the increase of industrial production efficiency, and also hope to adjust the difficulties in this transition period with effective methods, so that the labor movement should be closely linked with the consumer cooperative movement to complement each other and reduce the living expenses of workers and lay the foundation for the urban cooperative movement. Mr. Blelloch believed that the transition period would inevitably be quite difficult, and advocated that China should adopt the strengths of foreign labor legislation to adapt to China's current situation in a flexible manner and gradually advance. It is also understood that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the China Industrial Association, and the China Labor Association are scheduled to jointly hold a tea party at the Peacock Hall of the International Hotel at 4:00 PM today to welcome him.

### Fatal Car Accident Claims Three Lives

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday afternoon, a large ten-wheeled Jeep truck, number 36970, belonging to Qiming Transportation Company on Yuanmingyuan Road, loaded with a large amount of wood, was driven by driver Tang Cunlian (25 years old, from Yangzhou) to Yunqiao Township in Dabai to build a yarn factory. Tang's friend, surnamed Shen (20 years old), who was learning to drive at a driving school, accompanied the truck. When they reached Zhabei, Shen drove north. When they reached the vicinity of Xianjiazhai at Jiaotong Road and Zhongshan Road, they were heading east when, due to slippery roads due to rain and Shen's poor driving skills, they crashed into a cement pole number 37 on the south side of the road. The car overturned, and Tang and Shen both had their brains splattered and died on the spot. Yao Amao, who ran a cigarette and paper shop in Tangqiao Township, also suffered severe head injuries and was unconscious. Later, the Dabai Police Station reported the incident, and Director Zhang Youzhi ordered the police to investigate.

### Chen Heqin, Principal of the Kindergarten Education College, Actively Promotes Living Education

[Our Newspaper's Report] The National Kindergarten Education College, having moved from Jiangxi to Shanghai, has completed its first enrollment process, admitting a total of forty new students. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Chen Heqin, the principal of the college, who kindly shared the following remarks: The slow progress of Chinese education today is largely due to the insufficient change in educational attitudes. For years, teachers have only known how to hold onto books and teach, and students can only follow books and study rigidly. In fact, the entire world, the vastness of nature, and the social environment are all teaching materials, and there is no place that is not suitable for teaching and learning. Therefore, when I promoted living education in Jiangxi, it was because I felt that Chinese education must now be thoroughly reformed. For example, when learning about the method of making soap, the knowledge gained from a book is far less rich and the impression less profound than allowing children to visit a soap factory to observe the manufacturing process themselves. Therefore, the effectiveness of living education is sure to be twice the result with half the effort. Living education is a teaching method without classrooms or textbooks; anywhere can be a classroom, and anything can be teaching material. Its slogan is "Doing, Learning, and Teaching are one." It especially emphasizes the word "doing," because anything becomes easier to understand and remember after being done. Living education has five major systems, including: three major goals, four steps, five activities, ten comparisons, and twelve principles. Its teaching steps are consistent with the educational philosophy of the famous Belgian educator Decroly, which are: first, observation and experimentation; second, reading and reference; third, writing and publishing; and fourth, review and evaluation. In this way, children's knowledge is not obtained from dead books, but first through their own observations, then by finding books to read, then by expressing their opinions on the subject, and finally through collective discussion. The impression gained in this way is very profound, and this kind of knowledge is the most valuable and true knowledge. Finally, Mr. Chen cheerfully told the reporter: "In all departments of the Shanghai Municipal Kindergarten Normal School, living education will be implemented from this semester. As for the results, it depends on everyone's efforts, the attention of the community, and well-intentioned criticism and assistance to reach a conclusion." Mr. Chen confidently said: "Living education will definitely have a bright and splendid future. This is something we can believe in, and we have such firm confidence because it is a product of the development of the entire Chinese social landscape."

### Alumni of the Normal College in Shanghai Host a Banquet for Liao Mao Ru

### Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai: Second Primary School Occupied

Yesterday, They Hosted the Press, Requesting Support

[Our Newspaper's Report] The school board of the primary schools of the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai hosted the press at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 20th) at the association on Xizang Road. Chairman Yan Boying reported on the occupation of the Second Primary School building established by the association, stating: In 1936, the association leased land at 539 Gongping Road, Hongkou, and built a three-story Western-style school building to establish the Second Primary School. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was occupied by the enemy and used as a military medical school. After the victory, just as preparations were being made to restore the school, it was unexpectedly taken over by the Shanghai Provisional University of the Ministry of Education. Subsequently, the university leased it to the Shanghai Teachers Training Institute as a dormitory for its students. After repeatedly submitting documents and presenting them to the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the Ministry of Education, and the Municipal Education Bureau to request its return, the association finally received an official reply from the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in July of this year, stating: "We have received your submission. After investigation, the property rights of the school building do indeed belong to the submitter. It should be approved for return. In addition to separately notifying the Shanghai Teachers Training Institute to relocate, please be informed of this approval," etc. At the same time, the bureau forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Teachers Training Institute, Shanghai Provisional University, and the Ministry of Education for review and relocation. However, many days have passed, and this has not been done. The association has repeatedly sent documents to the Ministry of Education, but to no avail. Recently, it has been heard that Jinan University, the successor to the Provisional University, is planning to use it as a business school, which would dash the association's hopes of restoring the school. Now that the start of the current semester has passed, they only hope to achieve the desire to restore the school next semester. When Mr. Yan reported, his emotions were very intense, and he repeatedly stated that the Ministry of Education is the highest educational institution in the country. At a time when national construction places the greatest emphasis on education, how should it support the educational undertakings of various regions to enable them to develop and complete the great task of national education? Today, it allows its subordinates to forcibly occupy people's schools, which is akin to destroying education. Therefore, in addition to sending a telegram to the Municipal Council to appeal, it is specially requested that the press provide support and uphold justice.

### Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Discusses Current Economic Measures: Managing the Shipment of Yarn and Cloth to Southern China, Perhaps Also Selling to Southeast Asia; Allocation of Yarn Remains Unchanged; Industrial Loans Can Be Assisted

[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister Wang Yunwu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs attended a luncheon yesterday at the invitation of the Sixth District Machine Textile Industry Association. Others present included Wang Xiaolai, Shu Yunzhang, Li Shengbo, Liu Wenteng, Wang Qiyu, and Rong Hongyuan. After the meal, they exchanged opinions on current yarn market allocation and southern transport issues. The meeting ended at 3:30 PM.

After the meeting, Minister Wang answered many questions raised by reporters from various newspapers. The important points are summarized as follows: (1) The "Provisional Measures for the Transportation and Management of Cotton Yarn and Cloth to South China" have been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The regulations on the amount of yarn and cloth transported to South China will, in principle, refer to the amount of yarn and cloth transported to South China in 1936 and 1937, and then weigh the degree to which the current production of yarn and cloth has decreased compared to that time, and then determine a reasonable export amount of yarn and cloth. (Reporter's Note: According to some authoritative estimates in the textile industry, in 1936 and 1937, taking the four ports of Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou as examples, the average monthly export was about 800 bales of yarn and 116,000 bolts of cloth. In terms of production capacity, the number of spindles operating in each factory in 1936 and 1937 was about 5 million spindles, which has now been reduced to 2.5 million spindles. The actual production has shrunk by about half.) (2) South China is part of the national territory. If there is no transshipment for smuggling purposes, the sale of yarn and cloth to the south should not be a problem. In the future, the sale of yarn and cloth to the south will be increased after investigating the actual needs of the local area. At the same time, on the premise of maintaining stable yarn prices, the possibility of exporting to Southeast Asia will be considered. This will not only meet the urgent needs of Chinese manufacturers in Southeast Asia for cotton yarn, but also obtain foreign exchange for the country. (3) In the future, the Textile Industry Management Committee will be responsible for reviewing the sale of yarn and cloth to the south. Yarn and cloth approved for sale to the south will be notified to customs for release. (4) The issue of cotton yarn smuggling from Hong Kong has been discussed with the Hong Kong government, and they have agreed to assist in stopping it. The case of transshipment and smuggling in Macau is currently being resolved. (5) The second joint allocation of cotton yarn by state-owned and private factories will remain at 30,000 bales. The various allocation methods are roughly the same as before. (6) The method of purchasing new cotton and granting loans is under consideration. It is planned that the Textile Industry Management Committee and the Sixth District Yarn Factory Association will jointly discuss collective purchasing methods. If necessary, the state will provide assistance to loans for industries related to people's livelihoods. (7) The Industrial and Commercial Supervision Office is expected to be formally established next month. The organizational law of the office has been passed. The organization is simple and the purpose is pure. Its purpose is to guide private industrial and mining enterprises and international trade. (8) The Enterprise Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has now been abolished and replaced by the International Trade Department. (9) The Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will be closed by the end of September as much as possible. The various departments that still have unfinished matters at that time will establish another office to close them. (10) A large batch of Japanese rayon is about to arrive. Because it is handled by the Central Trust Bureau, it is imported through barter trade with Japan, so the Central Trust Bureau will decide on the allocation method.

### US Dollar Rises Sharply; Market Rumors Abound; Gold Price Follows, Rising by 24,000

The Shanghai gold market opened modestly yesterday, but strengthened near noon, still influenced by the US dollar. It opened at 2.147 million and sold well. Overnight gains were also sold. It briefly fell to around 2.135 million before stabilizing slightly and rebounding slightly. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars, and the price also rose to 2.1475 million along with the market. It then remained stable, hovering around 2.15 million for a long time. However, as the US dollar was bid higher and higher, it rose to over 2.17 million along with the US dollar near noon. It slightly retreated at noon, struggling around 2.165 million. The afternoon was even more exciting, rising to over 2.18 million before retreating slightly. As a result, it closed 24,000 higher than the previous day. Decorative gold rose to 232,000. Silver bullion and silver dollars were stable. The implicit interest rate fell to below 0.13 due to the loose money supply.

Foreign currency chips were extremely scarce and could not withstand large purchases. It was weak at first and then strong. Near noon, it returned to a state of short squeeze. It initially sold for 3,440 yuan. After opening, it fell to 3,400 yuan before finding support. After 10:00 AM, buyers were eager, fluctuating around 3,450 yuan. Near noon, the upward trend was strong, and the buying sentiment permeated, rising to over 3,650 yuan. The afternoon was even more intense, with settlement demand high. Rumors arose, and a short squeeze and scramble to buy re-emerged, soaring to 770 yuan before leveling off slightly. As a result, it closed 260 yuan higher than the previous day. The exchange rate with gold converged to 586.5 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars were also passively driven up to as much as 37 yuan.

Government Bonds Rose and Fell Slightly

The supply and demand for government bonds was limited. The process was volatile. The strongest of the unified bonds, C, opened at 2,000 yuan, retreated to 1,890 yuan in the middle of the day before rebounding slightly, rising to 2,030 yuan before settling slightly, hovering between 1,960 yuan and 1,990 yuan near the close. As a result, it closed slightly lower, 20 yuan less than the previous day. The gains and losses of the others were minimal.

### Foreign Stocks Turned Sideways After Rising

Cold stocks had transactions. General hot money tended to search for cold stocks.

### Black Market for Cotton Yarn: Goods Come from Allocation; Price Limits Plus Surcharges

[Datong News Agency] The cotton yarn dealers in this city have expressed to the Textile Construction [Company] that this is the opinion of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Therefore, the cotton yarn dealers will recently send representatives to petition the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The yarn market is trading as usual, and all cotton yarn is traded from goods flowing out of the hands of manufacturers who have received allocations. The prices are all based on the black market. It is said that recently many private yarn factories are also selling goods without complying with the price limits, and are profiting in ingenious ways. That is, for a bale of cotton yarn worth 1.3 million yuan, the customer pays the check and account according to the price limit, and prepares an additional 200,000 yuan in cash as an additional payment, which is not recorded in the accounts, so even if it is investigated, there will be no trace. When asked about this situation, the yarn dealers also said that it has become an open secret.

### Rice Prices Are Strong

The rice market yesterday was buoyed by the lack of sunshine and reports of rising prices from the Jingwu production areas, causing both the northern and southern markets to show vigorous trends. Japonica and indica rice rose by 2-3,000 yuan. Bai Yuan (white rice) also stopped falling and turned to rise. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to sell 440 bags of Brazilian rice, with a total of over 8,000 piculs registered. Flour sales remained strong, rising another 3-400 yuan. Wheat bran was high and getting more solid, continuing to rise sharply, rising another 2-300 yuan. Broad beans also rose by 1,000 yuan. Shantou and local oil mills were carefully picking up soybeans, and the higher-priced goods still stood firm, rising slightly by 3-400 yuan, but the medium-grade goods remained flat because there were still many arrivals and few buyers. Mung beans have recently seen a sharp drop of 7-800 yuan, as there are many arrivals from Hankou, but sales to Southeast Asia are stagnant, and local sales are also weak. Corn, after days of a sharp decline, stabilized after exhaustion. Raw peanuts could not compete with consumption, boiling up by 4-5,000 yuan. The oil market was balanced between arrivals and consumption. The store side was active but not prosperous, and the situation tended to be flat, lacking any disturbances for the time being. Xinghua and Quanzhou wheat had some sales, and the market was firm and stable.

### Timber: Arrivals Continue; Sales Are Sluggish

[Our Newspaper's Report] Timber from the United States, the Philippines, and Zhejiang and Fujian continues to arrive in Shanghai. Although prices have not fallen, sales are sluggish, and inventories are congested. It is said that there are no less than 100,000 tons of timber waiting to be shipped from Fuzhou, which will take a year to transport by the Linsen and Zhoushan ships. Yesterday, the Linsen ship returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou, carrying over 1,700 tons of timber. The Sumeifan and Co. of the Norwegian shipping company Shunting Yangxing transported over 250,000 feet of timber from the port of Minte in the United States, which is expected to arrive next Tuesday.

### Market Was Hot Then Cold; Chinese Stocks Traded Mediocrely

Chinese stocks were buoyed yesterday by reports that the Ministry of Finance explained that there were no restrictions on the overdraft amount for the banking industry, and that no guarantee was necessary. The market was bullish, and prices rose sharply again at the opening. The buying sentiment in the market turned strong, and the dealers took the opportunity to push up prices, with various popular stocks continuing to flourish. After half an hour, the market gradually showed fatigue, and the bulls became panicked again, gradually trading lower. After 11:00 AM, the overnight gains and the dealers were again unable to support the market, and sought to sell, and the situation suddenly became weak. However, there was some short covering on dips, and there were slight twists and turns. At noon, the market struggled at low prices. Only Xin Guang was more active and showed a small performance. The rest were difficult to cheer up. As a result, Yongsheng and Jingfu closed flat compared to the previous day, and Mei Ya and Qinxing fell slightly, while Xin Guang rose slightly. Among the colder stocks, the silk industry rose by half a percent, Tongyi and Huafeng were flat, and Zhongfang, Datong, Xin Ya, and Jinglun each fell by half a percent. The losses of the rest were not much, and the off-market stocks also fell slightly again.

In general, the market situation yesterday was hot at first and then cold. The total volume of transactions was less than 6 million shares. The market for each ticket company rose first and then fell, but the magnitude of the rise and fall was very small. The difference between the highest and lowest prices of each hot stock was only about 2%. The market atmosphere was extremely peaceful and there were no major fluctuations.

### Italian Orders Hit the Market; Rayon Continues to Fall

Yesterday, the rayon market continued to fall. 120 Tianqiao Youguang (Bright) closed at 3.2 million yuan in the morning. It continued to fall by 30,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was 80,000 yuan less than the upper afternoon. Miscellaneous brands Youguang (Bright) was short by 60-70,000 yuan, and semi-glossy was short by 40-50,000 yuan. The arrogance in the black market was slightly reduced, and there was no longer the prestige of the previous two days. Because the first batch of Italian silk orders has been listed and the foreign firm continues to accept orders, the price is far from the current market, so buyers are waiting and watching. The transaction price of grade 78 D of factory silk was 50,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Medium and ordinary goods increased by 50-100,000 yuan because factory sales were active. The prices of Yu Jing were at the original level. Silk goods were sold at high prices again, and the sales of large fine wool fabrics were not bad, 4-500 yuan higher than the previous day, and the rest were firm and stable. Because workers in Hangzhou are making requests to increase wages, it is feared that it will have to be looked at favorably.

### Shuangma Standard to Be Eliminated During the Second Allocation of Yarn; Cotton Purchases Should Be Free; Remarks by Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Textile Industry

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Machine Textile Industry Association, speaking to our reporter, after the state-owned and private yarn factories decided to handle the second group allocation of 30,000 bales of yarn, the 29 member units of the Sixth District Yarn Factory Association will gather at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the matters related to the allocation of cotton yarn. It is said that the stipulation that Shuangma brand yarn be the standard will be cancelled during the second group yarn opening. Anyone who meets the standard of 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn can be allocated at the opening price. Also, yesterday's spot price for 20-count yarn was 1.46 million yuan per bale, and the price for maturing spot contracts was 1.52 million yuan per bale, which is too far from the previous allocation price. Therefore, this allocation price will be slightly adjusted. Regarding the matter of collective purchasing of new cotton, he believes that based on past experience, it is not entirely satisfactory. This is because the production conditions of each factory are different, and the amount of cotton used varies. According to economic principles, it is better to adopt free competition. He said: In 1936 and 1937, my country's raw cotton production reached 16 million dan (a unit of weight). The annual consumption of the whole country was only 12 million dan, so there was still a surplus for export. If transportation is restored and raw cotton production is brought back on track, then the supply of raw cotton in our country should not be a problem. As for the main reasons for the current reduction in production by various yarn factories, there are no more than two points: first, the amount of power supply has decreased, and second, the working hours of workers have been shortened.

### Price of Cotton Yarn Increases by 50,000, Both Local Sales and Customer Sales Are Active, South China Also Making Purchases, Tianjin Merchants Most Vigorous, "Dragon Head" Priced at 75,000 with No Goods Available in the Market

[Report from our newspaper] The Yarn Mill Joint Distribution Committee convened its regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, resolving to sell a standard quantity of 20-count cotton yarn, totaling 1,054.5 pieces for private mills, fully allocated according to application amounts. The Textile Construction Corporation (紡建) distributed 2,245 pieces, also based on the standard distribution set by Textile Construction Corporation, with appropriate allocation. The selling price, using 400-pound 20-count "Double Horse" brand as the standard, is 1.35 million yuan per piece, an increase of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous distribution price. The next sales date has been set for September 23rd.

The market price of yarn is surging, with Tianjin merchants still actively stocking up, and sales on Changjiang Road are also brisk. As a result, prices increased by 50,000 to 70,000 yuan immediately upon opening. "Red Kui," "Color Kui," "Fairy Maiden," and "Double Happiness" brands are all targets for Tianjin merchants. "Large Flying Boat" brand is particularly essential for Jiangxi customers. Consequently, the aforementioned brands are uniquely popular. South China, which had been quiet for a long time, also made purchases yesterday. Furthermore, local construction factories are actively increasing their raw material purchases due to increased sales volume, driving the market upward. The opening of Textile Construction Corporation’s futures market further facilitates adjustments. However, "Blue Phoenix Abundance" brand is no longer as popular as in the previous two days, with the closing price showing limited gains compared to the previous day. The "Double Horse" brand once briefly exceeded the 1.6 million yuan mark but closed at 1.57 million yuan, still an increase of 50,000 yuan from the previous day.

The fabric market continued to rise yesterday, with the "Dragon Head" brand quoted at 75,000 yuan, but no goods are available in the market. High-end brands such as "Abundant Crane Divine Eagle" are being completely snapped up. Local dyeing factories are the largest buyers. These transactions are all for actual sales. Dyeing factories such as "Hua Feng's Mei Ting," "Mainland's Da Lu," and 190 mercerized fabrics are selling out as soon as they are priced. Low inventory and strong purchasing are creating this phenomenon.

### Extension of Coal-for-Electricity Method for Three Months

The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously established the "Coal-for-Electricity" method to facilitate electricity use for factories. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. This method was originally scheduled to expire at the end of August but has now been extended to the end of November. Factories requiring a certain amount of electricity can directly register with the Fuel Management Committee and apply to purchase coal. Once approved by the committee, they can obtain the necessary electricity.

### Market Ordered to Investigate and Determine Production and Sales Quantities of Flour

[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the Ministry of Food recently received a request from the Tianjin Wholesale Grain Merchants Association to lift the ban on flour exports, allowing Southern flour to be transported to the North to maintain food supply. The Ministry of Food instructed the municipal government to investigate and determine the actual production and sales quantities of flour in the Shanghai market, whether there is a daily surplus, and if so, how much. It is reported that this instruction has been relayed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, ordering them to complete the investigation within three days to submit to the ministry for review.

### 500,000 Pounds of Australian Wool Have Arrived

Australian wool was previously under government control, with fine wool of 60 counts or higher and medium wool of 50 counts or higher reserved for domestic use by the British textile industry, restricting exports. Currently, most of the shipments to China consist of lower-grade wool below 50 counts. The British textile industry no longer has a great need for these items, so they can be sold abroad. It is reported that the British merchant ship "Sam Jack" arrived at the port on the 19th, carrying approximately 500,000 pounds of mixed 40-count and 44-count wool, which will be unloaded today.

### Flannel Sales Are Booming

Fine wool, glossy flannel, regardless of stripes, checks, herringbone, or plain patterns, has been selling very well recently. Standard market prices have increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per yard. Old-style all-wool goods and imported goods are even more popular.

### Li Lai Establishes Third Factory

Li Lai Chemical Industry Factory, established in 1939, employs several pharmaceutical and chemical experts specializing in the research and development of various cosmetic and daily-use products, producing high-quality items. Currently, there are two manufacturing plants. Due to high demand, the company has purchased 30 acres of land to build a third factory, which is currently under planning.

### Technicians Request Payment of Differential Allowance Funds, Request to Join Municipal Government Cooperative

Dear Editor: I am a technician working for an affiliated agency of the Public Works Bureau. Our monthly salary, including rice allowance, totals around 80,000 yuan, which is hardly enough to maintain a high standard of living. I have the following two points that I would like to bring to the attention of the relevant authorities for improvement.

(1) In the past, the basic salary of technicians accounted for 80% of that of civil servants. However, since the adjustment of civil servant salaries in June, it has been reduced to 60%. With the approval of the Director, the Municipal Government agreed to increase it to 70% starting from June. However, we are still being paid based on 60%. We request that the authorities promptly issue the 14,000 yuan difference in basic salary for June and July. Furthermore, this month's newspaper reported that the National Defense Council approved an adjustment to civil servant salaries, with police officers and laborers also receiving increases based on the new standards, and decided to implement it starting in August. However, the instruction to adjust salaries has not yet been issued, and the rice allowance for this month has been temporarily suspended. Therefore, our salary for this month is only around 60,000 yuan. We hope that the authorities will, in this adjustment, at least restore the original basic salary of 80% and the additional increment based on base salary, and issue it as soon as possible.

(2) We are not allowed to join the Municipal Government Employee Consumer Cooperative, which prevents us from purchasing subsidized goods at fair prices. What is the purpose of the employee cooperative? Furthermore, with the newly established Public Education Personnel Distribution Center, police officers and sanitation workers from the Health Bureau are busy registering. Why does the Public Works Bureau favor its employees and neglect its workers? We hope that the welfare officer in charge will promptly arrange for us to join the cooperative and register with the Public Education Personnel Distribution Center.

Currently, roads are damaged, and ditches are blocked. Although this is due to a lack of road materials, the authorities' disregard for the living conditions of workers, which leads to low work efficiency, is also a major factor. If the above two points can be implemented and worker welfare is always considered, it will undoubtedly help improve work efficiency. (Liu Shunhua) August 28

Legal Questions

(1) Refusal to Hold Wedding Ceremony

Wang Rongsen asks: Since I was a child, I was engaged to a woman through my parents' arrangement and a matchmaker's words. Now that I am an adult, my parents are forcing me to get married soon. Despite repeated objections, it is still ineffective. I had no choice but to run away, but neighbors persuaded me to go home. Who knew that my parents had brought the woman home. My parents did not mention the marriage, and the other party's parents thought their daughter was already married, keeping her in the dark. I have not paid attention to her once in all these days. Now I have four questions, please answer: (1) Is this marriage legally valid? (2) If a notice is published denying the validity of the marriage, will it be effective? (3) If I want to dissolve this marriage, what legal procedures should I go through with the other party now? (4) If I marry another woman, will there be any unexpected problems?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) As stated in the letter, it is legally invalid. (2) To protect the other party's face, it may not be necessary to publish a notice. (3) Use a letter or face-to-face communication to express the reason for dissolving the marriage to the other party. If the other party is not at fault, you should pay reasonable compensation for damages. These damages are not limited to property damage. (4) At this time, if you marry another person, you will not be legally bound by the previous marriage, but it is still appropriate to dissolve the previous marriage before getting married.

(2) Termination of Contract Due to Illness

Chen Haoming asks: My friend, Ms. Xunhui, was engaged to a Mr. Feng at the age of seventeen (1940) through the arrangement of her parents. Now Mr. Feng is suffering from pulmonary disease due to hard work and has not recovered for a long time. For the sake of her lifelong happiness, Ms. Xunhui's parents came forward to negotiate with the other party to dissolve the engagement. The other party has been delaying on the pretext, and it has not been resolved for more than a year. According to the law, what is the proper way to resolve this?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] Article 975 of the Civil Code states that marriage may not be compelled. Article 976, paragraph 1, item 4 of the same law provides that if one of the parties to the marriage has a serious incurable disease, the other party may terminate the marriage contract. Since the other party has been ill for a long time and has not recovered, you can send him a letter expressing your decision to terminate the marriage. At the same time, you will not be bound by this marriage contract, but if the other party requests the return of the engagement dowry, it must be returned.

(3) Unauthorized Occupation of House

Duan Ruiying asks: (1) My husband's sister was married before 1924 (before the promulgation of the Inheritance Law). Does she have absolutely no right to inherit property? (2) Since my husband's father passed away (22 years ago), the property report shows that my husband (only son) is named. Now that my husband is working abroad, if his sister moves in and occupies the house without his consent, does this violate criminal law? Can I ask the court to stop it?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) If the date of your father-in-law's death was before October 1926, then your husband's sister has no right to inherit the estate. (2) Your husband's sister's unauthorized occupation of the house is not in accordance with the law, but because she has a blood relationship with your husband, you should use your feelings to resolve it peacefully. Otherwise, you can sue in court.

— Fanshi

Starting from September 9th, for the past two weeks, it has not only been a concern for all Shanghai citizens, but also for people all over China and even the world.

Looking at the council from a global perspective, when democratic politics has become as common and familiar as everyday meals in Europe and the United States, China has just begun to create it. In addition to our shame and vigilance, we find this newborn baby particularly precious. Looking at the council from a historical perspective, after thousands of years of inheritance of autocratic thinking by emperors, China has finally smelled the breath of the people's century, and the people's will has been formally expressed for the first time by the people's organizations. This is the beginning of a new era. We breathe the fragrance of the new era and feel infinite excitement and encouragement!

The performance of the council in the past two weeks, as criticized by a foreign newspaper, has far exceeded the expectations of the general public. We saw the enthusiastic and tense atmosphere and the serious and sincere attitude in the conference hall. We also saw councillors criticizing government agencies and denouncing administrative malpractice without any scruples, and speaking freely. We have also seen the various problems related to the people's livelihood being frankly raised and thoroughly discussed. All of this shows a good spirit and a healthy start. We do not necessarily expect this council to achieve any significant results. Just this spirit alone is enough to represent its significance and indicate the brilliant prospects of China's democratic future.

Spring and Autumn

### This Is Beautiful

— Xu Shiqi

On the journey of life spanning decades, pain and happiness are relative. Just as the arrogance of the scorching sun in midsummer is hateful, and the warm sunshine in winter, shining on the earth, is cherished; without experiencing the harsh winter, one cannot appreciate the preciousness of the bright spring, gentle breeze, and warm sunshine.

The appreciation and creation of art is to guide life into another ideal realm; to transform ferocity into harmony, to transform cruelty into love, to transform struggle into peace; to pursue the truth, not to be blinded by material desires, "Danqing does not know that old age is coming, wealth and honor are like floating clouds to me," this super-utilitarian thinking represents the essence of oriental philosophy.

The entire life history of an artist is like a lone boat sailing on the sea, encountering rushing waves, a biting north wind, and a lonely and bitterly cold night, relying on his personal adamantine belief and indomitable spirit, regardless of the current dark and dangerous objective environment, he wants to create and pursue the future of light. Michelangelo formed the statue of David in 1501, and its majestic and profound style is a rare masterpiece since ancient Greece; at the time, it was almost destroyed by the residents of Florence. The 19th-century writer Rodin, his masterpieces "The Thinker," "The Age of Bronze," and "The Burghers of Calais" were attacked and criticized, thus prompting him to create the immortal masterpieces "The Burghers of Calais" and "The Gates of Hell." These are all historical precedents. Not only artists, but also the achievements of scientists, religious figures, educators, and politicians, the performance of sacrificing one's life for righteousness, does not originate from the category of morality, but rather from the expression of the supreme beauty of human nature. Why did Confucius travel around the world without settling down; Prince Siddhartha, the prince of Jialuocheng in northern India, created the compassionate and empathetic Buddhism after six years of ascetic practice in the Himalayas; Wu Xun was a beggar from Tangyi County, Shandong. What rich knowledge and outstanding talent did he have that he was able to have a unique style in the history of Chinese education; President Lincoln, who liberated black slaves and sparked the American Civil War, unexpectedly was assassinated in 1865, why did Dr. Sun Yat-sen not avoid danger for forty years and create a revolutionary history of the Chinese nation's struggle?

Utilitarians, with their narrow-minded view of life that sits in a well and looks at the sky, destroy human nature and create a dark, tragic, and cruel history of blood and tears for mankind. People have long been tired of watching it. On the actual stage of life, let's continue to play the ugly dramas of greed, treachery, ferocity, and struggle, let's change our appetite and breathe the fresh and fragrant air of peace! Otherwise, the throne of "human beings are the spirit of all things" will fall into the dark abyss of "human beings are the spirit of all things."

### A Study of Shitao's Age and Place of Origin

— Liang Lieya

I am most fond of appreciating the calligraphy and paintings of my hometown's sage, Shitao. After reading Mr. Wen Fatong's "The Monk Shitao" in this column, it aroused my interest in studying Shitao again. Therefore, my views on Shitao's place of origin and age are somewhat different from what Mr. Wen said; I am willing to discuss it with people who are interested in studying Shitao.

Mr. Wen once said, based on Zhang Pushan's "Supplement to the Collection of Paintings," "Yangzhou Painting Garden," and Qin Zuyong's "Tongyin Yu Painting," "What kind of person is the monk Shitao? From the above readings, we can find simple records of "descendants of the former Ming Chu Fan" and "descendants of the Sheng State Chu Fan."

That's right, this record is based on evidence, but I think this evidence is a little unreliable, because "Yangzhou Painting Garden" and "Tongyin Yu Painting" are based on Zhang Pushan's "Supplement to the Collection of Paintings," and Zhang Pushan did not know Shitao very well. After he completed "Collection of Paintings," he went to Yangzhou and saw the Yangzhou Eight Eccentrics often imitating Shitao's paintings, so he included Shitao in the "Supplement," but he still could not accurately recognize Shitao.

We don't have to indirectly search for other works to find out what kind of person Shitao is? It is very convenient to directly refer to the paintings painted by Shitao, and we can get a very accurate answer. Didn't Shitao ever use two seals, "Descendant of Jingjiang" and "Tenth Generation Grandson of Zan Zhi"? This is Shitao himself explaining that he is a "Descendant of Jingjiang" and "Tenth Generation Grandson of Zan Yi, son of Jingjiang King Shouqian," not "Descendants of Chu Fan."

The Jingjiang King's palace was built under the Duxiu Peak in Guilin City, Guangxi Province, so Shitao often called himself "Seng Yuanji from Yue Mountain" and "Yuexi Shitao Ji" in the inscriptions on his paintings. In addition, he also had a seal that said "Yue Mountain." This evidence is also Shitao himself explaining that he is from Yuexi. In addition, Chen Ding from Jiangyin, who had been to Qian, Dian, and Yue, also said in his "Leixi Waiji" that Shitao was from Guangxi. Zhang Xianghe from Huating wrote a book "Yuexi Bishu" when he was a feudal official in Guangxi in the 25th year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, which also included a biography of Shitao. As for Mr. Wen saying that Shitao "is also a descendant of the Ming Dynasty," that is also very correct, but Mr. Wen cannot clearly specify that Shitao is not a "descendant of Chu Fan" and say that "Shitao is a Guangxi native."

Mr. Wen said this about Shitao's age: "Although his birth and death dates cannot be determined for the time being, judging from the first sentence of his poem "In the winter snow of Xinwei, Mr. Zhang Ruzuo sees talented people and heroes, and the seat is full for a while. The Duke will travel to the capital in the future, and he will write a thank you and a gift", "Half my life has been spent in the old north and south window", that year was the fourth year of Chongzhen (1631), he should have been thirty or forty years old", but when we saw the orchids and bamboos co-created by Shitao and Wang Yuanqi in the collection of the Palace Museum, it was made in the 30th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty (Xinwei). If we use Mr. Wen's textual research as evidence, then Shitao should have been one hundred years old by Kangxi Xinwei. Also, Wang Yuanqi was born in the fifteenth year of Chongzhen. If that Xinwei year was from Chongzhen, then Yuanqi had not yet been born, so how could he cooperate with Shitao? Moreover, there is no evidence that Shitao lived to be ninety-one or one hundred years old.

Mr. Wen also said that the Renwu year in Shitao's "In the third month of the Renwu spring, under the Dadi Hall, the sea crabs and enchantments are flamboyant, playfully writing and releasing the Buddha's legacy" is also considered to be the Renwu year of Chongzhen fifteen, but according to Shitao's own long inscription on the painting of plum blossoms, "I have had a branch since Gengshen, for six years, far and near, and I have not produced it elsewhere", Shitao was only thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of Chongzhen fifteen and still lived in Gengxi. How could he get a branch in "Yangzhou"?

Shitao's age is inherently difficult to find, but according to his handwritten note asking Bada to draw a picture of Dadi Hall for him, it says: "People hear that you are over seventy years old, and you climb mountains as if you were flying, you are truly a god among immortals. Ji is sixty-four or five years old, and everything is unbearable. Seeing that the new paintings and calligraphy of those who come and go are all treasures that Ji cannot praise. Today, Li Song'an returns to Nanzhou, with an empty letter sent up. Ji wants to ask you, sir, to draw a scroll of the hall, with a few cedars on the flat slope, and nothing in the pavilion, which is Dadi Hall?", we know that Shitao himself said his age. But this handwritten note did not record the year. Fortunately, later Shitao wrote in the poem inscription on the picture of Dadi Hall that Bada painted for him, "At the time, the summer of the Wuyin year, the mountain monk Daji Ji of Qingxiang Chen Ren drafted it", according to this year's speculation, it was the 37th year of Kangxi, "Wuyin", when Bada was seventy-four years old and Shitao was about sixty-eight or nine years old, which proves that Shitao was just a two or three-year-old child in the third year of Chongzhen, and it cannot be said that he was a person of thirty or forty years old.

There are not many surviving paintings of Shitao that clearly state the year. We use his inscribed years to measure his age until what year, and use it to estimate his life span. If it is calculated for ten years, the latest year is Dinghai in the 46th year of Kangxi (1706). Shitao probably passed away in this year, and his life span was around seventy-eight years old.

### Mr. Wang Yingbao's Landscape Painting Preface

— Pan Boying

The way of painting rises and falls with the times. In the past two or three decades, the style of crude and bold daubing has reached its extreme and is already outdated. As the nation enters a time of great renewal, with the resurgence of great undertakings and the rise of talent, the artistic style in the art world inevitably trends toward refinement and magnificence. Therefore, today's painters, all those who do not act frivolously, not only uplift the spirit of the times but also possess admirable ambition and energy. When I was young, I followed my father to the old capital while he was in office. Our home had a considerable collection of ancient artifacts and paintings. I loved them, but my talent was not up to learning. I particularly envied my classmate Wang Yingbao for his thorough study of the Six Canons of painting. His natural talent was outstanding, his brushstrokes elegant, and the smoke, clouds, streams, and waterfalls he painted seemed to have moisture on the paper. The meticulous details in his mountain paintings resembled the style of Wang Wei, while his exquisite shading and rendering often reminded people of the artistic realms of Zhao Zhongmu and Wen Zhengming. He is truly a brilliant talent. Later, Yingbao studied in America, and his contributions were recognized by the imperial court. His talent and reputation were highly esteemed by contemporaries. Despite his early love for painting, he continued to persevere. Now, he is about to exhibit his works to enlighten the Shanghai audience, allowing them to appreciate his cultivation. Alas! Yingbao and I have been apart for nearly a decade. Searching through my dilapidated boxes, I hope to find some remnants of his work to compare with his current exquisite skills and to prove my theory of the rise and fall of art. I wish to discuss this with elder art experts.

Tagore's Sayings
— Tian Rui

Thank the flame for its light, but do not forget the one who holds the lamp, for he stands steadfastly in the darkness!

Life is given to us; we can only obtain it by giving it away.

Trampling with feet can only raise dust from the ground, not reap a harvest.

The mission each child carries at birth is proof that God has not yet tired of humankind.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 39

— Ye Jingfeng

"Leave?" He seemed to confirm that I was suggesting he leave Changxindian. "Where would I go? First, there's no money for travel. Although there's some ancestral property in my hometown, I've already sold it piecemeal to cover household expenses for the past few years. Go to Beiping? There's no way. Perhaps I could ask a friend in Dingxian who runs a model village if he could find me a job? If there's no job, how can my family of seven or eight survive on empty stomachs?"

He said seven or eight, probably including the fourth daughter in the budget, "Ju Jun," as well.

"Brother Dingyuan," I pondered for a moment and said solemnly, "I can think of a solution, whether to leave or not, but the decision is yours. Staying here, though there are ways, doesn't guarantee safety..."

"Then, do you think this war is definitely going to break out?" He impatiently changed the question.

"Judging from Chairman Chiang's declaration, there's a 50% chance of peace and a 50% chance of war. In other words, if the Japanese act recklessly and stubbornly, we won't even get the minimum peace terms, and we'll have no choice but to defend ourselves. From the Japanese perspective, there's a 100% chance of war. As for safety, of course, you should leave, and leave far away. Dingxian is only a few hours away by train, so leaving there is like not leaving at all... I think for complete safety, there are probably only four places: Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan... Jiangxi, Anhui, Guangxi, I can't guarantee."

"Why such a wide range...?" The engineer's eyes widened in shock at my words, but he dared not fully believe them. "Is there any basis for this?"

"Brother," I decided to be frank, "Since you're a close friend, I'll tell you the truth. There's a very good reason for what I say. Not to mention anything else, just look at the 'Tanaka Memorial,' the Japanese have long been preparing to dominate East Asia. Recently, according to the Japanese General Staff's operational plan, they plan to have several major convergences in China—one force will go along the Beijing-Suiyuan line, through Datong to Taiyuan, then down to Luoyang; another will go along the Pinghan Line, through Baoding southwards, converging at Zhengzhou; then they will divide their forces again, crossing the Yellow River, and the forces going south along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will converge at Xuzhou; then they will converge at Wuhan, and then go east along the Yangtze River, and the main force landing in Shanghai will converge at Nanjing. If our government immediately moves south, they might even converge at Shaoguan... You can't say the Japanese are just dreaming. I remember a German military strategist saying that only five hundred German regular troops would be enough to trample all over China. Therefore, the Japanese expect to resolve the entire China issue in a very short period."

"Oh... so it's a matter of the entire nation's survival," he was touched by the concept of the nation. "Leave? That's not the answer... At most, we can let the children... the women... Strange, what's Song Zheyuan's opinion?" He lowered his head, as if discussing with himself.

Our conversation ended here. From his words, I could see his error. He probably thought the July 7th Incident was just a local issue. At the time, apart from a few clear-headed military and political figures, most people probably thought the same way as this engineer.

For several days, I was busy with work, waiting for news from Brother He, and didn't bother to ask about Engineer Dingyuan's affairs. He didn't come to see me again either. Brother He had safely arrived at the Panyang headquarters, but I hadn't received his special intelligence (regarding the progress of the seven secret letters). The only thing that made me feel slightly excited was that Mr. W had conveyed two good news, mentioning that both Mr. Fan and Mr. Xiao were making good progress.

On the evening of the 25th, I suddenly received an urgent telegram from Brother He. After careful consideration, I conveyed the entire content to Mr. W's station in secret, and suggested that he quickly decide on the action plan and notify them promptly. In less than half an hour, a reply came, stating that Mr. W himself would be responsible for conveying the message to Zhang Zizhong and Qin Dechun, and then Zhang and Qin would present it to Song Zheyuan. At the same time, I would go to see Wang Lengqi in person. Mr. W had already introduced Mr. Wang by phone.

What exactly was going on? Now that time has passed, bringing it up again, on the one hand, can confirm that the Japanese have always acted in the same way as reckless bankrupts: insidious, rogue-like, brutal, and cunning. On the other hand, it can also be said to be a joke, an odd story. Ever since July 7th, all the magic tricks the Japanese had played had been exposed by us, responding to their words with words, and blocking their force with force, never letting them achieve their goals, so they were furious. This time, the General Staff decided to launch a "three-step march:" the first step in preparation; to kidnap important figures in the North China region, to carry out what they called "abduction and guidance."

### Letter from the Youth League

— Shao Fu

Yesterday, I received a letter from the Three Principles of the People Youth League. The letter began with: "Do you remember that you once suggested to us that we build a children's park on the grounds of our league headquarters? Now we have decided to first try to run a nursery to answer the earnest expectations of you and the society..."

When I read this, I was very moved. The Youth League is a vibrant organization, using vernacular Chinese in its official letter and connecting it to past events, which is enough to prove that the person in charge has insight and planning. But when I read further:

"Now we send you a copy of the charter of the establishment, please publish it in your newspaper, if you could raise your voice and introduce it widely, we would be extremely grateful;..."

That set of official formalities appeared again.

Nevertheless, I still sincerely admire the spirit of the staff of the Shanghai branch of the Youth League. The Bible says: "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much." They have the courage to move forward, not neglecting details (a small suggestion I made a month ago), all of which proves their hard work and progress.

People outside the Kuomintang often have such a consistent criticism, and so do comrades within the party. They believe that the doctrine is good, but the comrades lack effort. At this year's National Congress of the Youth League in Guling, the President placed special hopes on the Youth League. If the cadres of the National Youth League can seize the opportunity, actively struggle, and show vitality, heroism, revolution, and vigor, it will not only inject new blood into the Kuomintang, but also be a great contribution to the nation.

The responsibility of the Shanghai branch is therefore particularly important in this situation.

### The Art of Deception

— Yu Qiang

Photographs have always been regarded as irrefutable "real evidence." However, some people can also use the skill of changing faces to forge photographs, making it difficult for people to distinguish between true and false.

Here are some photographic tricks.

Today, thousands of schools across the United States still hang a portrait of President Lincoln standing at an angle (Figure Two, right). Who would suspect that the Lincoln in this photo is not purely Lincoln himself? After seeing the picture on the left, you will suddenly realize that the photographer has played a trick of grafting. Because there are very few photos of Lincoln leaning, someone came up with a clever plan to "cut" off the head of John Coltin (the person in the picture on the left) and draw Lincoln's head on his shoulders, thus creating such a seamless Lincoln image.

The photo of Hollywood star Errol Flynn was also "cosmetically altered" by the student union of Princeton University - his two small mustaches were "shaved" off, and a pile of sailor-style hair was added - turning him into a "1940 standard Princeton student."

"Figure One" is a prank played by the American magazine Time: the collapsed building in the picture is the capital of Wisconsin. Who would not believe that it had collapsed after seeing this photo? Therefore, after this photo was published, citizens flocked to the Time magazine office to inquire about the truth, and telegrams kept coming. But these naive readers were too focused on the photo itself and ignored the small caption outside the picture - "April Fool's Day."

Figure Two: Lincoln's head was moved. (See "The Art of Deception" for details)

Figure Three: Fake childhood Hitler

Most readers must have seen the photo on the left of Figure Three and will not forget the title: "Hitler in his childhood."

To be honest, the hateful child in that photo is indeed not Hitler in his childhood. It is just a propaganda item satirizing Hitler, or rather, the masterpiece of an Austrian who hated this scourge in 1933. He modified a child from Westport, Connecticut, in the United States, shown in the picture on the right, into the hideous and hateful young "Hitler" in the picture on the left. After he modified it, he spread it internationally. At the time, Hitler was greatly annoyed by this matter, and it almost led to a diplomatic dispute between the United States and Germany.

As for who this Austrian was, no one knows.

### Old Tune

— Suo Bei

A Western proverb says, "He who is proud of his fine clothes is a fool." I believe that it is human nature to love beauty, and good-looking clothes can make oneself feel comfortable and others happy. But when you have a newly made garment, you must know that having beautiful clothes is only one-third of your beauty; another third is health, and the last third is knowledge. If you have all three, you are a truly beautiful person. Conversely, if you are a sick person, if you have no knowledge, then gorgeous clothes are nothing more than a mockery of yourself; they not only make you ashamed but also make you unpleasant to others.

### Self-Esteem · Self-Abasement

— Yi Fu

There are two sentences in the fate of China: "Self-esteem is not arrogance, and self-effacement is not self-abasement." Indeed, self-esteem is the admiration and cherishing of one's own personality, while arrogance is an exaggerated exaggeration. Self-effacement is a polite expression of respect for others, while self-abasement is contempt and destruction of oneself. I remember that Lu Qingxian said, "A person should not be arrogant, but one cannot be without pride; arrogance will make people hate you, but pride will make you not humble yourself in dirty things, not perfunctory, and your character will be upright." Having arrogance is self-aggrandizement, having pride is self-esteem, not having arrogance is self-effacement, and not having pride is self-abasement. This is really thorough.

### The recently deceased Father Jacquinot - Mother of Chinese Refugees

— Qian Fanfu

When the "August 13th" war broke out, after three months of fierce fighting, our army made a strategic retreat. Two hundred thousand refugees in Nanshi, caught off guard, did not have time to escape and gathered in one corner, waiting to die. The frenzied Japanese army rushed into Nanshi, intending to commit atrocities against the refugees, when suddenly a white-haired, long-bearded Westerner walked out of the shrinking crowd, dressed in a priest's attire, and stopped the Japanese soldiers who were raising their bayonets. His eyes were full of compassionate and fearless light, which drove that group of "werewolves" to hesitate and dare not act.

This old priest was Father Jacquinot de Besange. He demonstrated the lofty religious spirit with his actions of practicing his faith.

In November of the twenty-seventh year, when the Japanese army entered Wuhan, Father Jacquinot once again stepped forward and created the same moving miracle.

Skilled at speaking

Father Jacquinot, a Frenchman, was born in 1878. Before coming to China, he studied literature in England and stayed there for a long time. At this time, he had already joined the "Society of Jesus," the most powerful international organization of the Catholic Church, as a member. In 1913, he came to Shanghai, China, to preach and taught at Xuhui College, Aurora University, and other schools. He was fluent in English, French, Chinese, Greek, and Latin, and was skilled at speaking. Every gesture and every word had a moving charm.

He once spoke publicly to Aurora students: "People who engage in social work should have more interactions, activities, more friends, and study psychology, because society is a group of people, and to serve in it, one must thoroughly understand it, otherwise, the career will have no hope of success." Therefore, he had many friends, from all countries including China, Japan, Europe, and the United States.

Enthusiastic helper

In addition to personally negotiating with the Japanese army during the war and establishing two "refugee zones" in Shanghai Nanshi and Hankou urban areas, he participated in many charitable causes in China. In the past, he served as a "committee member of the Greater Shanghai Social Relief Committee" and "vice-chairman of the Anti-Foreign Famine Relief Association."

Before taking office, he paid a visit to President Chiang and his wife, and had a meal and fruit. Madam Chiang personally peeled the fruit for him because Father Jacquinot's right hand was disabled, leaving only his left hand. Regarding the loss of his right hand, some say that it was because he participated in the First World War and sacrificed himself for the country, while others have other legends. In fact, his right hand was disabled by accident. When he was teaching at Xuhui College and serving as a disciplinarian, on the day of the school anniversary, he saw students making firecrackers in the playground, preparing to set off fireworks to celebrate. Because the students did not have enough strength, he stepped forward to personally fill the firecracker. Unexpectedly, he used too much force, and the medicine in the tube exploded, and his right hand was destroyed.

Heaven did not grant him a long life

In the twenty-ninth year, he went to the United States to raise 700,000 US dollars for Chinese refugees and gave them to China for relief. April 29th was Father Jacquinot's birthday. The refugees in Nanshi took advantage of his stay in Shanghai to hold a warm birthday celebration. As soon as he passed by, people along the way shouted "Living Buddha," and Mr. Jacquinot was moved to tears.

At the beginning of this year, he was appointed by the Holy See as a representative to Berlin. On the 10th of this month, he suddenly died of malignant anemia. When the bad news came, the citizens of Shanghai mourned him endlessly!
