### Government Representatives Sun Ke and Five Others Urge Zhou Enlai to Return to Nanjing for Negotiations to Break the Stalemate; Marshall Seeks to Break the Deadlock

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] A response from the government representatives was delivered to the Communist Party delegation on the afternoon of the 3rd. The content briefly stated that the letter from Zhou Enlai and others had been received, and the government's response would be conveyed by Special Envoy Marshall.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai and others sent a letter to the government representatives on September 30th, with the same content as the memorandum to Special Envoy Marshall, requesting that it be forwarded to Chairman Chiang. Government representatives Sun Ke and others responded on the 3rd, stating: "To Messrs. Enlai, Biwu, Yuzhang, Jianying, Weihan, Dingyi, and Yingchao, greetings. We have received and forwarded the letter entrusted to us for Chairman Chiang. The government's views have been conveyed by Marshal Marshall, which we trust you have noted. We sincerely hope that Mr. Enlai will return to Nanjing immediately to continue negotiations, so that peace and unity can be realized at an early date. Respectfully, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, and Zhang Lisheng."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Communist Party representative Wang Bingnan visited Ambassador Stuart at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to inquire whether the government's statement on the 2nd included a response to the Communist Party's previous memorandum proposing a meeting of the Military Three-Person Committee. According to the spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation, Ambassador Stuart did not provide a suitable explanation on this matter. Ambassador Stuart visited Special Envoy Marshall twice on the 3rd, at 10:00 AM and 3:30 PM, and invited representatives of the Democratic League, Liang Shuming and others, for lunch at noon. In the afternoon, Youth Party leader Zeng Qi also visited Ambassador Stuart. Zeng stated that his visit was to express his respect to the ambassador. Around 5:00 PM, the ambassador, accompanied by Chuan Jingbo, visited President Song, and at 8:00 PM, attended a banquet held by the Turkish ambassador.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 3rd] After the government's reply to General Zhou Enlai was sent, the prospect of a resolution between the government and the Communist Party remains extremely slim. Communist Party spokesperson Wang Bingnan told reporters after meeting with Ambassador Stuart this morning, "The situation is extremely serious." The Communist Party headquarters in Nanjing is awaiting General Zhou Enlai's response to the government's proposal of "maximum concessions." The Communist Party does not seem to attach much importance to this proposal. According to a Communist Party official, "This memorandum is no different from the previous one and does not change its basic principles." One newspaper stated that although Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have been influenced by the current situation, they have not lost heart and still hope to open the "locked door of the situation" through political and military subcommittees.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] U.S. Embassy spokesperson Conner stated in the afternoon of the 3rd that the news released by the Central News Agency on September 30th, stating that "Chairman Chiang has agreed to the simultaneous holding of the Three-Person and Five-Person meetings proposed by Marshal Marshall," is inaccurate in stating that the above proposal was made by Marshal Marshall.

### After the Government Issued a Public Announcement, Various Parties Express Their Opinions; Shao Lizi Says the Government's Attitude is Extremely Fair

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] After the government issued a statement on the final limits of its tolerance regarding the current situation, all parties paid close attention to how the Communist Party would react. The spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation stated on the evening of the 3rd that they would not express any attitude until instructions from Zhou Enlai arrived. As for the report in a certain newspaper today that the Communist Party spokesperson made concessions to the government's proposal to reorganize the government, it is not worthy of attention. Regarding the allocation of seats for state council members, which does not comply with the Political Consultative Conference resolution, the spokesperson formally denied it, stating that he did not make such remarks yesterday. Democratic League Secretary-General Liang Shuming returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd and made the following statement regarding the government's announcement: "Regarding the 12 seats for the Communist Party and the Democratic League in the state council, and the recommendation of one more person from the Communist Party among non-partisan individuals, totaling 13 seats, I, representing the Democratic League, solemnly declare that the Democratic League will first refuse. This is different from the past government's tacit agreement that the Communist Party and the Democratic League would have 14 seats together. The 14 seats are the will of the Democratic League. The reason why the Democratic League wants to coordinate with the Communist Party in the National Assembly to occupy one-fourth of the seats and in the state council to occupy one-third of the seats is to promote the Communist Party to lay down its arms and provide the Communist Party with a safeguard. Regarding the 13 seats, I discussed it with Luo Longji and Zhang Shenfu when we visited Shao Lizi on July 5th. Shao said that the Communist Party and the Democratic League would have a total of 13 seats in the state council. I said that 13 seats are less than one-third of the total. Shao replied that 13 seats could serve as a veto, and there are time, place, and people as proof. Now, the government's proposal of such ingenious 13 seats is an insult to the social elites and shows that it has no sincerity in this matter. Not only can the Democratic League not accept it, but social elites with integrity will also definitely not accept it." Zeng Qi of the Youth Party said on the 3rd: "This statement by the government declares the greatest concession, and we will express our support." Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Council, said regarding the government's statement: "The nature of this government announcement adopts both the principle of the government's conditional ceasefire and the Communist Party's unconditional ceasefire. That is, the Communist Party first agrees, and then the Three-Five Conference is convened immediately, and a ceasefire order is issued, which implicitly gives the Communist Party a guarantee of a ceasefire. As for the issue of using the veto, although it is not mentioned in the statement, since both parties have already reached a tacit agreement, it should not be insisted upon excessively." Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, said on the morning of the 3rd: "If the Communist Party is willing to resume negotiations, an agreement can be reached in two or three days. The government has made the greatest concessions on the number of state council members. The crux of the Communist Party's problem may still be military issues." However, if we must wait for a resolution of the military situation in Zhangjiakou, the time will be further extended, and the problem will become more complicated.

### Chairman Discusses with Shanghai City Councilors that the National Assembly will be Convened as Scheduled; Zhang Zhijiang and Others Have the Same View

[Report from this Newspaper] City councilor representatives Tao Baichuan and Xi Yushu, who went to Nanjing to petition, met with Chairman Chiang in Nanjing and discussed political issues. The Chairman stated that the National Assembly will still be convened as scheduled. If political issues can be resolved, various industrial, commercial, and economic problems can be easily solved, and the economic situation in Shanghai will definitely improve. It is also heard that the Chairman expressed optimism about the future of the overall situation but said: "The people should have a sense of 'right and wrong'."

Mr. Tao attended a fellowship meeting of National Assembly representatives in Nanjing. According to some elected representatives, if the current problems between the central government and the Communist Party cannot be resolved smoothly, convening the National Assembly will inevitably lead to a stalemate. It may be better to postpone it, but most representatives opposed postponing it. According to Mr. Tao's personal speculation, there is a high probability that the National Assembly will be postponed by seven-tenths. He also speculated that there is a high probability that the National Army will capture Zhangjiakou.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] National Assembly alternate representatives Zhang Zhijiang, Wang Fengxiong, Fan Tiren, and others sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang of the National Government requesting to attend the meeting and separately stated their main demands to Minister Zhang Lisheng and others. In the afternoon of the 3rd, they also hosted the press to explain and at the same time announced their views on national affairs: 1. The National Assembly must not be postponed again. 2. National disputes should be resolved by the National Assembly. The civil war must be stopped, and the whole country must be unified.

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] According to government officials, the three routes of the National Army attacking the periphery of Zhangyuan may reach the city by the weekend. The exact strength of the Communist Army defending Zhangyuan is not yet known here.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] Communications circles report: The stations on the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway have been successively recovered, and the Ping-Jin Railway Bureau has ordered workers to rush to repair the tracks between Qinglongqiao and Kangzhuang starting from the 3rd.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 3rd] About 3,000 Communist troops, consisting of infantry and cavalry, who had been entrenched in the area more than 20 kilometers northeast of Xinghe County, attacked the National Army stationed in Xinghe at the end of last month. The National Army there counterattacked, and the Communist Army, unable to withstand it, retreated to Hongtuyou (6 kilometers east of Xinghe) to resist stubbornly. The National Army then completely surrounded them. After a fierce battle, the Communist Army captured the Communist regimental commander Liu Qingfa, deputy regimental commander Wang Delin, company commander Li Mingqi and other six officers, and more than 200 soldiers. The rest scattered and fled, and seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, and horses.

### National Army Counterattacks on the Ping-Han Railway, Recaptures Caohe to Protect the Repair of the Railway, Baoding Announces Martial Law, Internal Peace

[Our Beiping Dispatch] The Communist Army continues to attack fiercely on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway. Authentic news: The two divisions of the 94th Army of the National Army arrived at Changxindian on the 3rd and immediately began a counterattack southward from Songlindian, while protecting the repair of the railway. It is expected that the lost land can be recovered within a week, and traffic can be restored within ten days.

No trains going north from Shijiazhuang departed on the 3rd. 23 kilometers between Baoding and Fangshunqiao are open to traffic.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Caohe, which was captured by the Communist Army on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, was recaptured last night by the National Army counterattacking northward from Baoding. Fangshunqiao and Songlindian are still under siege. At 9:00 AM on the 3rd, a National Army armored train hit a mine near Songlindian. Last night, two trains derailed after hitting mines south of Zhuoxian. They were repaired on the morning of the 3rd. The situation at Yujiazhuang is still unclear. Two regiments of troops led by Rang Bocheng and Ma Chan, totaling more than 3,000 people, attacked Fangshunqiao east of Liulihe and south of Zhuoxian. It is reported that Liu Bocheng has set up his headquarters in Hancun, 15 miles west of Songlindian, and He Long has set up his headquarters in Yixian, but it is speculated that this is probably the headquarters of the commanders under Liu and He. According to Xinhua News Agency, established by the Communist Party, Wangdu, Xushui and the Wangdu, Wangdian, Qingfengdian, Caohe, Beihe, Gucheng, Xushui, Songlindian and other stations were also captured by the Communist Army. The Tanghe, Xinle, Shahe, Caohe, Beihe, Xushuihe and other bridges were destroyed.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 2nd] More than 10,000 Communist troops have gathered near Zhoukoudian in an attempt to destroy the Liulihe Railway Bridge and prevent our reinforcements from going south to relieve the siege of Baoding.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 2nd] After the Communist Army launched an offensive on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, Wangdu fell on the evening of the 1st.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] Nine regiments of Communist troops and more than 20,000 militiamen gathered south of Mancheng and west of Baoding in an attempt to attack Baoyuan. Fighting broke out simultaneously at Shilitoutai north of Baoding City and Suncun, 15 miles east of the city, at 10:00 PM on the 2nd. The Communist Army at Toutai has been repelled, and the battle is still raging at Suncun.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 2nd] The flames of war on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway will be extinguished under the continuous pressure of the reinforced National Army.

Gaobeidian, Songlindian, Dingxing County and Station are still firmly held by the National Army. The railway was completely destroyed for 30 miles from Wangdu Station to Fangshunqiao. The Communist Army transported the rails and sleepers westward with a large number of carts. There are no traces of the Communist Army in the suburbs of Baoding. The current situation is that 700 Communist troops have been found east of Zhuozhou, and there is peace and tranquility south of Dingxian and north of Songlindian. Although Wangdu Station was occupied by the Communist Army, the county seat is still safe. There was heavy rain yesterday in the upper reaches of the Yongding River, and the Guichuan River swelled.

### Chu Xichun Arrives in Beiping

### Communist Army Attacks the Northern Section of the Ping-Han Railway is a Harassment and Sabotage Action; Spokesperson of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters Says They Will Prevent It

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] The Beiping National Army Headquarters claimed that Yan'an had issued orders to all Communist troops to prepare to launch a nationwide offensive.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] The Communist Army in Hebei has been ordered by Yan'an to launch a large-scale offensive on the northern section of the Ping-Han Road in an attempt to expand the flames of war in North China, threaten Beiping and Tianjin, hinder the reopening of political consultations and the convening of the National Assembly, and make Marshal Marshall's mediation more difficult.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] The spokesman of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters said: The Communist Army's attack on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway is its usual trick of harassment. This is not only the case in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway. On September 25, more than 6,000 Communist troops attacked Yangzaizhuang in Shunyi, resulting in the capture of two companies of the garrison there. Another four or five thousand people attacked Liujiazhuang in the southwest of Shunyi, attempting to attack northern Beiping. On the 29th, a unit of the Communist Army fled to the Shahe and Xishan areas of Changping, with the intention of attacking western Beiping. On the 29th, they also launched a large-scale offensive on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway for hundreds of miles, destroying telecommunications and railways. It is very obvious that this is a planned harassment action. In order to protect the locality and maintain traffic, the National Army decided to repel them, and in order to prevent them from fleeing and destroying traffic everywhere, they were forced to occupy Kangzhuang. While the Communist Party is advocating a ceasefire, it suddenly launched this large-scale harassment and sabotage operation. I don't know how they can justify themselves. The National Army was forced to take action in self-defense.

### Unstable Domestic Financial Situation, Industrial and Commercial Flight Capital Flees to Hong Kong, Reaching Hundreds of Billions of Yuan in Recent Months

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 2nd] According to sources in Hong Kong, a certain Shandong man recently registered a business company with a capital of up to one billion Hong Kong dollars with the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong government is paying close attention, and the Hong Kong financial community is particularly shocked. Although this company has not been established, there have been actual examples of domestic funds increasingly fleeing to Hong Kong. Major banks and money shops in Shanghai have set up branches or offices in Hong Kong, and many import and export foreign firms and trading companies have moved to Hong Kong to operate. Most of the newly emerging cotton weaving factories in Kowloon are also invested by industrialists from Shanghai and Guangdong. Many wealthy merchants and tycoons in China have taken large sums of money to Hong Kong to live as rentiers. According to authoritative figures in the financial community, this is due to the unstable financial situation in China and the sluggishness of industry and commerce, which have left funds with nowhere to invest. In recent months, the amount has reached hundreds of billions. The Bank of China has taken measures to prevent capital flight to Hong Kong, but it is feared that these measures will be ineffective if the value of the legal tender is unstable. The gold market here is stable. It opened at 2715 for selling and 270 for buying on the 2nd. However, the Hong Kong dollar continued to rise, breaking the 8-dollar mark yesterday (1st), reaching a high of 8110. The US dollar was at 3990.

### Solving the Flight of Capital to Hong Kong Requires Stabilizing Finance

Chairman of HSBC Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss

[Report from this Newspaper] Mr. Arthur Morse, Chairman of the British HSBC Bank, returned to the Hong Kong headquarters on the Yongsheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson at 11 a.m. the day before yesterday after a stay of two weeks in Shanghai. He gave concise answers to some questions raised by our reporter before leaving. He said: Although my visit to Shanghai was temporary, I was deeply impressed by the activities of various businesses in this large port. In my opinion, the prosperity and activity of Shanghai are mostly due to the booming industry and commerce. However, speculative activities have unfortunately become an unavoidable factor. However, before the fundamental economic and financial problems of the country are resolved, it may not be easy to control the activities of speculative activities. Regarding the flight of capital to Hong Kong, this issue has been closely watched by the authorities. I think that as long as the domestic disputes in China cease and the financial situation stabilizes, this problem will be solved easily. Mr. Morse is 54 years old and has served HSBC Bank for 30 years. In 1940, he returned to England to serve as the manager of the London branch of HSBC Bank. After the outbreak of the Pacific War and the fall of Hong Kong, Mr. Morse was appointed as the Acting General Manager of the bank, and soon promoted to Chairman and General Manager of the bank. HSBC Bank has branches all over the world, including England, America, France, Japan, India and various parts of Southeast Asia. The headquarters was originally located in Shanghai, but was moved to Hong Kong in April of this year. It is heard that Mr. Morse will now be stationed at the Hong Kong headquarters for office work

Fierce fighting continued throughout the night, but they did not succeed. Another unit of the Communist army bypassed Lingshan and attacked Wangsuozhuang (20 li north), but was intercepted by National forces. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 3rd] Since the National forces recovered Heze in western Shandong, a large number of Communist forces have gathered in the area between Heze and Juye, with the intention of attacking the National forces again. The 5th Brigade of the 25th Division, entrenched in Longgangji (40 kilometers east of Heze), has been completely defeated after two days of counterattacks by the National forces. Furthermore, the National forces recovered Wenlou on the 2nd.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The battle for Lianshui is intensifying. The Communist army must defend it to cover the withdrawal of supplies to southern Shandong, while the National army must take it to remove the threat to Huai'an and Huaiyin. Although the Communist army has amassed a force of 40,000 men, they are gradually becoming unsustainable under the fierce counterattacks of the National army. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place in an area more than 20 li southwest of Lianshui, and the National army is less than 40 li from the county seat.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 3rd] Xiaojizhen in the 10th District of Taixian has been recovered by the people's self-defense forces. Communist militia entrenched in the town fled north. The northern suburbs of Taixian can be cleared in the short term.

In the recent war, we fought together against a common enemy for a common purpose. Under the wise leadership of President Chiang, the people of your country endured fierce aggression for eight long years. I can only admire their indomitable courage. I firmly believe that China and the Philippines can continue their effective cooperation based on mutual respect and understanding, and jointly advance towards the goal of establishing lasting peace and prosperity for the people of the East and the world. In order to ensure that your Excellency's important mission of strengthening the friendly ties between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of China can be completed, my government and I will do our utmost to cooperate."

### Tani Hisao and Isoya Renusuke Escorted to Nanjing for Trial Yesterday; Three Decks of Playing Cards Found in Luggage

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Japanese war criminals Tani Hisao and Isoya Renusuke were escorted to Nanjing today.

As the two criminals were escorted into the detention center in a vehicle of the Ministry of National Defense, Tani Hisao was holding a water bottle in his hand. The two criminals brought a lot of canned food. During the inspection of their luggage, three decks of playing cards were found. Both criminals are former Japanese army lieutenant generals. They were imprisoned in separate cells. Tani Hisao will be the second war criminal to be tried after Takuma Sakai. The people of Nanjing are closely watching the public trial of this principal culprit in the Nanjing Massacre.

### New Director-General of the CNRRA Arrives in Nanjing; Date of Taking Office to be Determined After Meeting with the Chairman; Reportedly, No Changes Planned to Existing Policies

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The newly appointed Director-General of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), Huo Baoshu, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 3rd to attend the business meeting of the Four Joint Offices and will also meet with the Chairman. In an interview with a Central News Agency reporter, Huo stated: "The date of my taking office will be determined after receiving a formal order and meeting with the Chairman. I have no specific opinions to express at present. However, relief and rehabilitation work are extremely important, and rehabilitation work is even more important than relief work. We should make good use of relief materials to lay the foundation for economic construction. Relief work is like fighting a fire, and we should seize the time. Starting one day earlier can save more refugees. Therefore, we must have the spirit of a religious person to ensure that everything is done fairly and universally. At the same time, we should try to adopt criticisms from all sectors of society and strive to improve in order to enhance international credibility. After I take office, I do not intend to make any changes to any policies or plans, but only to intensify their implementation. As for personnel matters, I have always advocated that everyone should be in the right position and give full play to their abilities, so that the overall work can be perfected." Huo's courtesy name is Yamin. He is from Xinhui, Guangdong. He is 53 years old. After studying at St. John's University, he studied economics at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Tennessee in the United States. After returning to China in 1923, he served as Chief Secretary of the Construction Committee, and is currently a member of the Northeast Economic Commission, Deputy General Manager of the Bank of China, and Chief Auditor. Huo also met with President Song on the morning of the 3rd.

### Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Investigation Team Goes to Yingcheng to Handle Important Cases

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 3rd] Miao Peicheng and He Hanwen, members of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Investigation Team, yesterday invited a military prosecutor and more than ten military police officers from here to Changjiangbu, under the jurisdiction of Yingcheng, to handle an important case and will return to Hankou within a few days.

The prosecution of these cases has been long underway and was reported in a previous telegram from this newspaper. The re-issuance at this time is due to frequent criticisms from all sides, so the investigation process is described in detail to show the seriousness of the court's position. Zheng Dalun, the Chief Prosecutor of the court, also stated: "We will do our best to assist in the investigation and prosecution of corruption and bribery in order to close the cases quickly."

### Jiang Tingfu's Whereabouts Uncertain; CNRRA Held Regular Office Meeting Yesterday; Many Middle and Lower-Level Staff Do Not Want to Stay

[Our Dispatch] CNRRA still held its routine office meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. Jiang Tingfu and all department heads attended. Jiang immediately declared: He had met with Huo Shishu the day before and immediately requested Huo to take over the job as soon as possible, and asked him to work hard to maintain a peaceful atmosphere to avoid affecting the relief work, because all countries are very concerned about the CNRRA. Jiang also tried to persuade the heads of various departments of the CNRRA, who had all expressed their intention to resign to him, to work with peace of mind in order to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the office. Jiang also revealed: Hu Shi of Peking University also telegraphed him to invite him to teach, but he has not yet decided where to go, and whether to go to the United States has not been decided. Although Jiang's resignation case was passed by the Executive Yuan's regular meeting, it was not submitted for discussion at the Supreme National Defense Conference on Wednesday, so the procedure has not been finally decided. However, the approval of the National Defense Conference is only a routine matter, so it is only a matter of time.

After Jiang's resignation was announced, the CNRRA was in a relaxed state. Because the leaders were not familiar with Huo Baoshu, they could not help but feel a little uneasy, while many middle and lower-level cadres were busy sorting out their personal belongings and preparing to seek other ways out. No matter what the character of the new boss is, the CNRRA will end its term in the short term, so they do not want to stay out of fear.

President Song has telegraphed CNRRA Deputy Director Li Zhuomin, asking him not to resign for the time being, because Li is most familiar with the internal work of the CNRRA, and the new director will need his help a lot. In addition, Dong Chengdao, the Chief of Finance of the CNRRA, was also retained by Song.

General Egerton, the Director of the UNRRA China Office, told reporters who visited him about Jiang's resignation that the CNRRA is a Chinese government agency, so he could not express his opinion on the change of personnel in the CNRRA, but he hoped that the successor would be a capable person so that the progress of the relief work would not be affected.

Jiang Tingfu still did not receive reporters who visited him yesterday, but he seemed to be very interested in the reports in various newspapers.

### CNRRA Staff in the Capital Continue to Work as Usual; Deep Regret Over Jiang's Resignation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] CNRRA staff here worked as usual on the 3rd. When reporters visited the agency's office at Xinhua Building, the sound of typewriters continued incessantly, and official business was also very busy. There was no indication that Director Jiang's resignation had affected the work. According to a senior official, disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and no delay is allowed. The agency plans to complete the repatriation of refugees before the end of the year, and time must be seized. Jiang's departure has had a great impact on everyone's mood, but the work must continue. Another senior official, receiving reporters next to a desk full of files, admitted that the reports in the newspaper that the heads of various agencies would resign were very likely. He said that although it is impossible to know what the situation will be in the future, he will continue to work for the refugees as long as he is in office. Other personnel all deeply admired Jiang's sincerity, fairness, seriousness, and scholarly demeanor, and regretted not being able to continue to be led by him.

### Egerton to Visit Nanjing Today

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The new Director of the UNRRA China Office, Egerton, will be accompanied by Director Jiang Tingfu to Nanjing from Shanghai at noon on the 4th to meet with Chairman Chiang. This is Egerton's first meeting since arriving in China.

### CNRRA Anhui Branch Prepares for Winter Relief

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] According to Ke Yupu, Deputy Director of the CNRRA Anhui Branch, who came to Nanjing to negotiate the request for relief materials, the disaster situation in more than 30 counties in eastern and northern Anhui is extremely serious. In addition to man-made disasters, there are also locust plagues and floods. More than seven million people have suffered, and two and a half million people cannot live without relief. The branch has issued more than 4,000 tons of wheat flour to carry out emergency relief and work relief, and is working with water conservancy agencies to repair dikes. The branch is also preparing for winter relief work.

[This City News] The CNRRA Guangxi Branch has recently been building roads in Guangxi Province, recruiting 20,000 workers in the form of work relief, and allocating 2,000 tons of relief rice to build the Guilin to Quanxian, Rongxian to Wuzhou, Nanning to Longzhou, Liuzhou to Libo, and Guixian to Binyang sections of the highway.

### French Priest Enters Lolo Area to Redeem Missing American Pilots; Rescue Plane Carrying Silver Arrives in Chengdu

[United Press, Chengdu, 2nd] After the discovery of missing American pilots doing hard labor in the Lolo tribes on the border of Xikang and Myanmar, the US military authorities are working to rescue them. Father Pottier, a French priest in Xichang who has lived among the Lolo people for 20 years and is fluent in their language and customs, will enter the Lolo area alone or with several Americans to negotiate with the fierce and xenophobic chiefs in order to redeem the American prisoners. A rescue plane, carrying silver, wool, and other redemption items, is expected to arrive in Chengdu today, and will then proceed to Xichang. According to Father Yi of the Chengdu Catholic Church, the story of the capture of four or more American pilots by the Lolo people is very strange. It is said that a B-29 aircraft, flying from Chengdu to Kunming in 1944, was forced to land in Huaxi, on the border of Xikang. Father Leler, a French priest living in a nearby village, and Mr. Yin, a Chinese pharmacist in Ya'an City, both knew about this. According to Mr. Yin, some of the rescued crew members were captured by the Lolo people and taken to the interior of the western Lolo area, becoming prisoners. Leler and Yin have never met, but they said the same thing. Three months ago, a Chinese opium merchant who had traded with the Lolo people went to the border. According to the merchant, Father Breid of the Sacred Heart Church and an American official said that there were four white people in the Lolo area, wearing Lolo clothes and doing hard labor. This report shocked the American side. With the assistance of Professor Glacken of a university in Chengdu, an investigation was conducted and it was learned that a B-29 aircraft had landed on the border of the Lolo area, and the crew members were rescued by a Chinese chivalrous person. This has been confirmed by the American side. At the same time, it was confirmed that seven of the eleven crew members of the second crashed aircraft had died. Professor Glacken, originally an explorer, is familiar with Lolo customs and originally intended to negotiate with the Lolo people alone, but because the school was starting, he did not have time to take this risk. Finally, he wrote to Ambassador Stuart, urging him to take steps to confirm or deny this report. At that time, Commander Wachtler, Director of the Mortuary Department of the US Military Headquarters in China, and Father Breid also arrived here from Shanghai to go to Xichang together. It is not known whether their trip was successful. The redemption procedure cannot be completed in a few weeks, especially since it is heard that a civil war is taking place in the Lolo tribes, which has added many difficulties. Wachtler and his party not only want to find out the truth of the incident, but also want to collect the bodies of the deceased crew members.

### Chongqing Yarn Prices Soar; Speculative Firms Go Bankrupt; Entire Market on the Verge of Collapse

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 3rd] In the Chongqing cotton yarn market, due to the soaring yarn prices, many speculative firms have gone bankrupt in recent days, and the situation is extremely chaotic, so that the entire market is on the verge of collapse. The Chongqing Cotton Yarn Association announced yesterday morning that it would suspend trading for fear that yarn prices would continue to rise and be uncontrollable. The severity of this yarn price fluctuation is unprecedented in Chongqing. Within a week, each package has soared by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. As a result, "Juyi Yang" was the first to declare bankruptcy. Other smaller firms have actually bought in 10 to 20 million yuan. Because they cannot deliver the goods, they have gone bankrupt. The industry association is constantly holding board meetings to seek solutions. It is heard that Huasheng and Dechang have suffered less losses among the bankrupt yarn firms, while Changhua and Shengxin have suffered more. One yarn firm is supported by shareholders. Although the losses are around 80 million yuan, it is still compensating the full amount. According to people familiar with the industry, if the recent rise continues, the October mid-term futures may have a more terrible phenomenon.

### Population of Jiangxi Decreases Daily; Wasteland Abounds and Production Sharply Reduced

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 2nd] The population of Jiangxi Province has been decreasing due to the impact of Communist disturbances and war disasters. In 1914, the population of the province was 15,391,610. In 1945, it decreased to 13,041,165. In the past ten years, the population of the province has decreased by 2,350,445. Compared with the number of 23 million at the end of the Qing Dynasty, it has now decreased by 10 million. As a result, wasteland abounds in Jiangxi, and production is sharply reduced, forming a serious social problem.

### Water Level of the Yellow River in Western Suiyuan Drops; Flood Season Has Passed; However, Strong Winds and Rising Water in Tuoketuo County

[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 2nd] Tian Zhusheng, Deputy Director of the Suiyuan Water Conservancy Bureau, said: The water level of the Yellow River in western Suiyuan has now fallen from 2.9 meters to 1.9 meters. The dangerous period of autumn floods has passed, and the current water level has entered a normal state. However, the Yellow River is rising in Tuoketuo County, downstream along the river.

If the wind does not stop on the night of the 2nd, the dam may be breached, and the city may be submerged.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The Yellow River dike in Jiefeng Village, 15 li west of Wuzhi, has recently been backflowing into the Jingzhen Qin River due to the surge of the Yellow River. The water level in the flood area has also increased by two feet.

Editorial

### The Great National Situation Cannot Be Mismanaged Again!

At a time when the Five-Person Group and the Three-Person Group are expected to convene simultaneously, and political and military issues are expected to be resolved through simultaneous negotiations, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) suddenly presented a memorandum equivalent to an ultimatum, stating that negotiations would be declared broken off if the government did not cease hostilities in Zhangjiakou. This is a surprising move by the CCP at a time when negotiations could be reopened. Its intention is to force the government to reveal its last card.

Regarding the CCP's memorandum, the government issued a stern statement the day before yesterday, putting forward two suggestions for resolving the current situation: (1) The government has already agreed to hold a Five-Person Conference to discuss changes to the National Government Committee. Recently, it has also prepared to hold a Three-Person Conference to discuss a ceasefire. If the CCP refuses to negotiate, then the CCP will be fully responsible for all consequences arising therefrom. (2) The government must seek reasonable and legal solutions to pressing political and military issues to obtain practical and effective guarantees. At the same time, the ultimate limit of concession is proposed: 1. The government will compromise on the number of seats in the National Government Committee, allowing eight for the CCP, four for the Democratic League, and one of the independent seats to be recommended by the CCP, with government approval, totaling thirteen seats. The CCP should then submit a list of members for the National Government Committee and representatives for the National Assembly; 2. Implement the troop reorganization plan in earnest, quickly stipulate the garrison locations for the Communist troops, and set a deadline for them to enter those locations. Once these two issues are agreed upon, the government will immediately announce a cessation of military actions. This is the government's last card, and we are now waiting for the CCP to reveal its hand.

The overall situation in China has indeed reached its most tense and critical stage in the past few days! Whether it is the government or the CCP, or even the parties that claim to be third parties, everyone should be aware of their historical responsibility to the country and the nation. By "responsibility," we do not mean to settle scores from the past, determining who should be responsible for the CCP issue escalating to such a disastrous state today, nor do we insist on judging which side is responsible for the breakdown of the year-long peace talks. This is because the responsibility for the past is already clear, and the public has already made a "silent" judgment. One only needs to look at how the people who had been "liberated" in the recovered cities of northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui welcomed the National Army, tearfully pouring out their grievances, to know where the people's hearts lie. Therefore, our appeal to everyone to value "responsibility" is precisely at this crucial moment. How the government and the CCP make decisions, how the third parties respond, and how they conduct themselves in terms of advancing and retreating, are all related to the safety of the country, the well-being of the world, the fate of 450 million compatriots, and the future of the Republic of China. The stakes are simply too high, and everyone must not take it lightly or act rashly.

First, let's talk about the CCP's side: for the past year, there have been rumors that Yan'an instructed not to resolve the issue through negotiations. There are many examples that seem to confirm this rumor, making it hard for us to disbelieve it, but we will still treat it as if it didn't exist. Even though some say the Communist Party deliberately wants to "drag" the chaotic situation in China until 1948, waiting for the peak of the world revolution to arrive, and that this "dragging" is meant to collapse the Chinese economy, overthrow the National Government, and make troop reorganization and nation-building impossible, or at least delay American material aid to China and assistance in building up our military until they give up, the sudden propaganda attack at a time when peace talks are most hopeful not only makes negotiations hopeless but also risks a complete breakdown. We still don't understand why the CCP wants to do this. Is the CCP not Chinese? What good does it do the CCP to drag China down? How can they face their compatriots and descendants?

We believe that since the government has formally declared to both Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart, and asked them to convey this to the CCP, and has frankly presented the limits of its concessions, the CCP should accept these two points readily, immediately urge Mr. Zhou Enlai to come to Nanjing, and simultaneously hold meetings of the Five-Person and Three-Person Groups. Acting quickly and speaking frankly, everything can be resolved, and why can't the war be stopped immediately? At this time, the CCP must not think that as long as it creates a split in China, it can obtain external assistance and gain a favorable position. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union is willing to take action in China at this time and create a third world war, even if the situation unfolds as the CCP wishes, it will only bring suffering to the Chinese people and will not benefit the CCP. Why does the CCP need to be an enemy of the people? It is better to "lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot," abandoning the old ways of fighting for cities and land, and instead arguing for political programs and policies openly and honestly in the National Government and the National Assembly. Saving the people from their plight and establishing a model of democracy all depends on a single thought of the CCP.

Furthermore, let's discuss the government's perspective: the government has always adhered to the principle of political resolution, seeking a reasonable and legal solution to the CCP issue through negotiations, and has already revealed its last card. We can well understand the government's sincerity. However, following the Spring and Autumn Annals' principle of urging the wise, we still hope that the government will make further efforts to ensure that negotiations can be reopened and that peace will not break down. This is because the CCP is, after all, just an opposition party, a party nominally not responsible while out of office (although in reality it is certainly different from opposition parties in other countries), while the government must be responsible to the people. The government is not unaware of the people's suffering or their expectations, and there is more than one way to relieve their distress. However, when it is possible to avoid using force, ending the war is the best policy. Mencius said, "He who does not delight in killing can unite the country," and this principle still applies today. We know that the government's use of force in the past two or three months has been a necessary act of self-defense and counterattack. However, if the CCP can now reliably guarantee that it is willing to resume negotiations and implement agreements, it would be a blessing, and the door to peace need not be closed. Even if the fighting in Zhangjiakou is declared temporarily suspended for several days to observe what happens, it seems permissible. With a benevolent heart, "doing good to others," the government might as well give the CCP one last, and then another last, chance.

We believe that what the government should strive for is the big picture, not the small details, the overall situation, not just one corner. The government should make every effort to show its sincerity in welcoming all parties to participate in the National Assembly and the National Government, while insisting on the effective implementation of the troop reorganization plan, and everything else is secondary. The government must make it clear to the world that it possesses utmost sincerity in seeking peace, so that Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart can fulfill their missions; even if, unfortunately, it is not successful, the government can claim innocence before the world and future generations. If the government today embraces the grand aspiration of "I would rather the world betray me than I betray the world" in handling the CCP issue, then even the most stubborn stone might nod in agreement, and perhaps hope can be placed in the CCP, and the country and the people will greatly benefit. Otherwise, the CCP will inevitably become what Mencius called a "reckless person," and it may not be able to deceive the world again.

### Homicide Case Should Be Handled According to Law

Zang Da'erzi, a rickshaw puller, was fatally struck by a foreigner in front of the Anlegong Dance Hall on Xikou Road in Shanghai late on the night of the 22nd of last month, resulting in his death due to serious injuries. This matter is an ordinary homicide case that occurred in society. Regardless of who the murderer is, it can be handled according to legal procedures. Citizens, standing on humanitarian grounds, express sympathy for the deceased or donate money to help his surviving family, which is also normal human sentiment. However, some people see this as a rare opportunity; because anti-American propaganda is lacking materials, they seize on the issue, calling it a "blood case" or a "tragedy," and organize support associations, making a big fuss, seemingly as if it is a major political blood case. In our view, we feel that it is an overreaction and too exaggerated. In a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai, one can often see such homicide cases every day in the newspapers. Not only Shanghai, but also London, New York, Paris, and Moscow, how can they not have these homicide cases? We should calmly think about it: the inside story of this homicide case is not very complicated. As long as everyone handles matters according to the law, it is not difficult to obtain a fair resolution.

First, regarding the question of the murderer, there are now many rumors circulating outside. Some say it was American soldier La Naijia, others say it was Spaniard Lai Lunouqie, and still others say it was an American sailor. There is no agreement. We believe that to solve this problem, the local court's prosecutor's office and the police station should take full responsibility for investigating and must find out the real murderer. If the real murderer is an American soldier, he should be tried by an American military court according to wartime regulations. The deceased's family's request for punishment of the murderer and compensation. America is a country ruled by law, and it is believed that it will be handled according to the law. If the real murderer is an American sailor, then since he is not a soldier, he should be brought to trial by our country's court, because America has already announced the cancellation of consular jurisdiction in China, and handling matters according to the law is also no problem. Assuming that the murderer is Spanish, he should naturally also be tried by our country's court. What's more, Lai Lunouqie has already been detained by the Huangpu Police Branch. It is only necessary to transfer him to the local court's prosecutor's office.

Second, this homicide case has absolutely no political significance, let alone involving international issues. Social homicides caused by feuds and conflicts are the same in China, the United States, and even the Soviet Union. Where is there no such thing? For example, causing trouble by brewing alcohol, assaulting and injuring people, and even deliberate homicides occur almost all the time. This is of course an exposure of social defects and human weaknesses, but up to now, there is still law that can make up for this deficiency. Therefore, whether it is an American soldier or a Spaniard who beats our compatriots to death, it is no different from ordinary homicide cases. We may as well donate to help the rickshaw puller because he is pitiful, but we also do not need to exaggerate the matter simply because it involves two foreigners. As for asking for something like "guarantees that similar incidents will not happen again in the future," this is even further off-topic. Asking this murderer, who was drunk and assaulting someone, since he was not instructed by anyone, no government in the world can guarantee that its citizens will never commit crimes. So, who would guarantee the so-called "guarantee in the future..."? The law clearly stipulates that murderers should be punished, so there is no need to add unnecessary details. Mayor Wu said, "The vehemence of our country's public opinion attack makes the American authorities think it is naive." This sentence is worth thinking about carefully.

In short, this is a homicide case, and the victim has already filed a lawsuit with the court. The court should take responsibility, and we should also trust the court. As for organizing support associations or petitioning the municipal government, these are all irrelevant digressions that make a big deal out of nothing, and they are of no help to the legal handling of the case itself.

### Shen Honglie Answers Reporters' Inquiries on Eight Major Issues of Zhejiang Province and Establishes Three Pacification Zones of Siming, Kuocang, and Wencheng

[Reported from Hangzhou by this newspaper] Reporters from various newspapers recently listed eight questions of interest regarding important provincial affairs and asked Chairman Shen: (1) the organization of the three pacification zones, (2) the issue of abolishing the commissioner's offices, (3) the issue of reducing the in-kind collection of land tax to 50%, (4) the issue of provincial civil servants' salaries, (5) how to achieve fiscal balance in this province, (6) the provincial assembly's suggestion to postpone conscription for one year, (7) the progress plan of water conservancy projects in this province, and (8) the repair plan of important highways in this province. Chairman Shen, considering that the questions raised were very important and of concern to the people of this province, personally provided written answers on the 2nd, briefly stating the following: (1) The Siming, Kuocang, and Wencheng pacification zones in this province. The Siming zone was officially established on September 15th, and the other two zones are being organized and will be established this month. (2) The abolition of administrative supervisory commissioners is related to changes in the national political system and is not a matter for one province or one region. (3) After the provincial assembly requested the central government to reduce the land tax to 50%, I also asked the Ministry of Food by telephone to change the collection to 50%. It is expected that it must be decided and implemented within a week. (4) The central government stipulates that civil servants' salaries will be adjusted starting from August. Considering the financial difficulties in this province, they are still issued according to the old standards. The shortfall will be requested from the central government for borrowing and then re-issued. (5) The provincial finance cannot be balanced. The fundamental reason is that the new central revenue and expenditure system reduces the financial resources given to the provincial level. Therefore, there is often a shortage of funds, insufficient by 7 billion yuan, and it is difficult to remedy. The tax sources have also been greatly reduced. If adjustments are to be made, all aspects must be considered. (6) The provincial assembly's suggestion to the central government to postpone conscription for one year has been forwarded by the provincial government to the central government for approval. (7) Water conservancy projects in this province are divided into four major categories: flood control projects, large-scale farmland water conservancy, small-scale farmland water conservancy, and hydropower projects, totaling nineteen types. The required funding is indeed very large, but since it concerns the people's livelihood, the government and the people should mobilize their efforts. (8) Repairs to the various highways in this province have been planned as a whole, roughly divided into highway engineering and county road engineering.

[Another report] The funds borrowed from the central government for the expenses of various agencies in Zhejiang province for August and September have already been remitted to Zhejiang for distribution. It is now known that after the adjustment of salaries for provincial civil servants in August, the amount that should be increased for borrowing has been remitted from Beijing to Hangzhou by 500 million yuan and handed over to the provincial treasury for collection. The Finance Department has issued a notice, ordering various agencies to collect and distribute it as the adjusted salary for August.

The group will stay in Suzhou for about four or five days, hoping that people from all walks of life will report as much as possible.

[Reported from Wuxi by this newspaper] Fan Yusui, the leader of the Beijing-Suzhou Group of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Receiving and Inspection Group, and his party of four, accompanied by Gao Hu, the director of the Nanjing Office of the General Administration, came to Wuxi from Nanjing on the evening of the 29th of last month. After getting off the train, they were greeted by Yang Jicheng, the director of the Enemy Property Office in Wuxi, and had dinner at the office, where he reported everything. They stayed at the Garden Hotel that night. The next day, group leader Fan, etc., in order to understand the local situation and listen to general opinions, especially convened a discussion meeting at the Enemy Property Office's conference room, bringing together military, government, party organs and local gentry and the press in Wuxi, because there were many criticisms from the outside world about the handling of enemy and puppet industries in Wuxi. Group leader Fan first reported on the mission to Wuxi and hoped that all sectors would provide materials.

People Have Complaints

Then Speaker Jiang of the Provisional Assembly spoke, saying that the people have many complaints about the seized enemy and puppet industries, and the Assembly, standing on the people's position, had to come forward to inquire. In May, the Assembly decided to send a letter to the Handling Bureau requesting the publication of the seized materials list, which was delayed until recently. However, there was no original list, making it impossible to review. Speaker Jiang also asked Director Yang about the total amount of seized materials on the spot. Director Yang replied that the total value was 800,000,000,000 yuan, and 230,000,000,000 yuan had been realized from auctions (excluding counter-properties). However, Speaker Jiang replied that the actual amount was 2,000,000,000,000 yuan, which I can assert. The atmosphere at the meeting was quite tense at that time. On the morning of the 1st, Group Leader Fan and others began their inspection work, first going to the site of the Jinji Silk Factory outside the West Gate, which had been converted by the enemy into the Zhonghua Lihua Company Alcohol Factory, to investigate. Then they went to inspect the 39th Warehouse, which was received by the military and government under the Gongyun Bridge. Then they went to the Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Plant received by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Zhoushanbang to inquire about the receiving process and the current production situation. In the afternoon, they inspected the 102 Warehouse of the 14th Logistics Station Sub-Supervisory Department of the Logistics General Headquarters at Heliekou. The warehouse was originally built by the enemy and stored military supplies. After the enemy surrendered, many kinds of materials were left behind. However, because the warehouse facilities were simple and could not withstand wind and rain erosion, most of the barley, wheat bran, soy sauce, and refined flour stored in the warehouse were moldy and rotten. Group leader Fan lamented that the complete warehouses in the urban area were mostly empty, so he sighed deeply at the sight. Then he went to the Huishan area to inspect one by one. Most of the items stored in the warehouse were various kinds of paper and pickled fish with barley. The barley was moldy, and the pickled fish was worm-infested and rotten into stinky pulp. Hundreds of boxes of biscuits were moldy and rotten and had become waste. All the team members shook their heads and frowned at the scene.

Where Did the White Rice Go?

At 4 p.m., the group drove to the Wuxi Rice Mill in Sanliqiao to investigate. The mill was transformed from the Changjiang Rice Mill, which was opened by the Japanese Kikawa. After the victory, it was widely rumored that the enemy had left behind more than 10,000 shi of white rice. The Sun Yuanliang department of the Third Front Army received more than 6,000 shi, while there were only more than 2,000 bags of white rice in the farmers' warehouse. Factory director Chen Mengyi was sent by the Provincial Food and Grain Department. The investigation and answers were specially made into written records for verification. At about 5 p.m., they crossed the river to the Jiufu Flour Mill to investigate. The mill was opened in 1932 by Liu Renyi and others in partnership with the Japanese Okamoto. After the victory, the mill had not yet applied for resumption of business. Although the Food and Grain Department sent personnel to take over, their attitude has been ambiguous and unclear, so the investigation has not yielded any results. It was decided to continue inspecting the factories on the 2nd.

### Corruption in Hainan Island Receiving Stolen and Lost Goods

[Reported from Guangzhou by this newspaper on the 2nd] Regarding the receiving of enemy and puppet materials on Hainan Island, new corruption incidents have recently been discovered. Yesterday, materials from fourteen cars were planned to be smuggled to the customs for sale, but they were discovered and detained by the local garrison. There were more than 200 automobile tires and a large number of machines. In addition, a batch of materials that had been counted and were waiting to be processed, such as automobile tires, cloth, and military blankets, worth tens of millions of yuan, suddenly disappeared. The authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation.

### Zhang Legu Detained for Unauthorized Seizure and Domination in Qingdao

In addition to Zhang Legu, a member of the senate and the president of the Civilian News, who has been detained, there are several other major criminals who have not been announced and have been detained. According to Guo Zhongwei, the head of the group, Zhang Legu used his authority to receive two enemy and puppet printing houses one after another without reporting them, and illegally occupied five properties, and dominated two theaters and one hotel and one dance hall. The total property swallowed up is more than one billion yuan. The case is serious, the evidence is conclusive, and the entire case will be transferred to the court for investigation and handling according to law.

### Two Bureau Chiefs in Taiwan Guilty of Corruption Transferred to the Court

[Reported from Taiwan] Liu Wendao, the head of the Receiving and Inspection Group, and the group members Zheng Kuiyi, Wang Bingjun, Cai Zisheng, Secretary Zhu Yu, etc., specially hosted reporters from various newspapers before leaving Taiwan to return to Beijing. Group leader Liu declared that Ren Weijun, the director of the Monopoly Bureau of this province, and Yu Baixi, the director of the Trade Bureau, were both guilty of corruption. He has now sent a letter to Chief Chen, asking him to give them administrative punishments as soon as possible and transfer them to the court to determine the punishment they deserve. Evidence is being collected, and they will also be dealt with appropriately. However, there are still several cases that will be taken back to Nanjing for processing because their cases are different.

### Missing One Copy of the Newspaper A Beating with Fists and Feet

[Reported from Dangtu by this newspaper] The Dagang Newspaper distribution office in this county, because the end of the month was approaching, specifically ordered the newspaper deliveryman Gan Mingzhang to collect the newspaper fees. Unexpectedly, yesterday (that is, September 30th), when he went to the Xie Feng Salt Shop on Mayi Street in Henan to collect the newspaper fees, the boss, Mr. Shen, was out. Unexpectedly, there was a Zhang Kaicheng, a 31-year-old man from Henan, who ran a cigarette stall, and who was of a violent temperament, at the entrance of the shop. Without any explanation, he came forward and took the receipt and deducted 300 yuan. The newspaper deliveryman then asked why 300 yuan was deducted. Zhang replied that he was missing two copies of the newspaper this month, which would be used as compensation. In fact, Dagang Newspaper had politely explained to him on the 22nd of September. Zhang Kaicheng not only ignored it, but became angry and punched and kicked Gan Mingzhang. In addition to injuries to his face, his waist and legs were also kicked. Later, a police officer from the Henan Police Station took Zhang Kaicheng to the station for questioning.

### Seagull Warship Still Not Captured Vows Revenge After Smuggling is Exposed

[Reported from Guangzhou by this newspaper on the 3rd] The details of the cracking of the Seagull warship smuggling case have now been ascertained. It has been found that the Seagull has smuggled to Zhanjiang more than once. Yu Shouchang, the director of the Xiying branch of the Leizhou Customs, was very angry when he heard about it. However, the smugglers were powerful and difficult to arrest. When Yu was transferred to the General Administration as an inspector, and the Seagull happened to arrive, Yu secretly reported to the Customs Department and sent personnel to assist in the arrest, thus cracking the case. The smuggled goods included thirteen large barrels of caustic soda, forty large barrels and eight medium barrels of kerosene, forty large barrels of bleaching powder, thirty-three barrels of paint, fifty-eight pieces of various goods large and small, thirteen large bags and two hundred and forty-six small bags of flour, worth more than one hundred million yuan. After Yu seized the goods, the smugglers still threatened revenge, but Yu had been transferred, so the smugglers could not do anything about it. The whereabouts of the warship are still unknown.

North Jiangsu Communist Army Plunders in Preparation to Flee

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] According to a person from Dongtai, the communist army in the Dongtai and Xinghua areas, realizing their military setbacks on all fronts, and being cornered in a part of Northern Jiangsu, is now like a turtle in a jar. As a result, they have been actively seizing supplies and transporting them north to Southern Shandong since last month. The Dongtai county government of the communist army has been busy collecting thousands of dan (bushels) of cottonseed and rice. They are also forcing rice mills and cotton gins to work through the night. Furthermore, it appears that they intend to dismantle and remove the machinery from the Dongtai power plant when they retreat. Moreover, during the fierce battle with the communist army in Haian in mid-September, over 400 innocent civilians were killed or wounded on our side, and over a thousand houses were burned down or dismantled, a truly tragic situation.

Suzhou Rice Prices Soar; Creating the Highest Prices on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Since the exchange rate adjustment, commodity prices in Suzhou have risen across the board. After some twists and turns, prices have mostly trended upward for more than a month. Among the main daily necessities, cotton yarn and silk fabrics have risen the most sharply, by about 30%. Next are miscellaneous grains, flour, cotton, tung oil, tea, and soap, which have all risen by 15%. Notably, at a time when new rice from the surrounding countryside is flooding the market, rice prices have instead soared. The main reason is the unwarranted manipulation and exorbitant price increases by speculators. In recent days, the rising trend has been unchecked. The current market price for top-quality white rice is 70,000 yuan, top-quality japonica rice is 60,000 yuan, new white rice is 65,500 yuan, and new white indica rice is 48,000 yuan.

Sent to Withdraw Funds, Suddenly Harboring Evil Intent; Wang Yunxiao Spends Lavishly for Half a Day; Fortunately, the Dali Silk Company Did Not Lose a Huge Sum

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Wang Yunxiao, an employee of the Dali Silk Company in the Kenye Building on Beijing Road in Shanghai, was sent to the Wuxi branch on the morning of one day to jointly withdraw 30 million yuan in cash from the China Farmers' Bank in Wuxi. After Wang arrived in Wuxi, he conceived an evil plan. At 2:30 PM, he secretly took the check alone to the bank to withdraw the money. After deducting 900,000 yuan for insurance fees, he obtained 29.1 million yuan in cash, which he stored in a leather suitcase and used lavishly in Wuxi. This was seen by Lu Peisheng, the warehouse clerk of the Wuxi branch, who became suspicious when he saw Wang's lavish spending and excessive use of money. He secretly followed Wang. Around 5:00 PM, Wang took the money to the station to board a train. Lu saw that Wang had not contacted the branch at all, knowing that he must have malicious intentions. Lu followed him on the train. At Suzhou station, Wang hurriedly got off the train. Lu secretly watched Wang until he arrived at the Queen Hotel, checking into Room 208 under the alias Gao Yongqing, claiming to be from Wuxi, 34 years old. Lu immediately reported this to the local police headquarters, who dispatched officers to arrest Wang and seize 28 million yuan in legal tender, which was confiscated and taken to the headquarters. Lu immediately returned to Wuxi to report to the branch and telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters. After preliminary interrogation is completed, the case will be handed over to the prosecutor's office in another location for further investigation.

Orders have been issued to stop the collection of these taxes, and the incumbent or former county mayors of each county and city will be given reprimands.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government now believes that all counties in this province have successively handled the review of candidates for public office. In order to establish a constitutional foundation as soon as possible, it specifically instructed the counties on three key points on the 1st: (1) The review of candidates for public office categories A and B in the recovered counties in Jiangnan and Northern Jiangsu must be completed before the end of October. (2) The counties in Northern Jiangsu should complete the review four months after the entire county is recovered. (3) Local gentry and public association members must be mobilized to participate in all levels of elections, and publicity should be expanded.

Bridge Flooded; Pedestrian Loses Footing; Official of Jinyun County Government Dies Tragically

[Our Jinyun Dispatch] Yao Yunyu, an instructor of this county government from Hangzhou, on the morning of September 27th, was ordered to attend a symposium in the old Huzhen District with the township heads and local gentry to consult on local opinions regarding the consolidation of townships. He traveled to Huzhen with Xu Changming, the head of the civil affairs section, and two policemen. Unfortunately, when they arrived at the Xiayang Bridge, heavy rains in recent days had caused the stream to swell, and there was still water flowing over the bridge. Yao and Xu, knowing that the meeting notice had been issued in advance and they must arrive on time, and seeing that there was no other way to cross, resolutely proceeded across the bridge. Halfway across, due to the murky water and difficulty in identifying the bridge stones, they both lost their footing and fell into the water. The two accompanying policemen were also unfamiliar with swimming and were unable to provide assistance. As a result, Xu was rescued, but Yao tragically drowned.

Byrnes' Speech Echoes Stalin; America Willing to Jointly Maintain Peace; De-Arming Germany; Drafting a Forty-Year Treaty

[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 3rd, Broadcasting: United States Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech at the Paris Citibank Society this afternoon, completely agreeing with Stalin that a third world war will not happen immediately. He once again invited the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France to jointly negotiate a treaty to disarm Germany. Mr. Byrnes proposed a 25-year treaty on May 1 of last year, which was opposed by Soviet representative Molotov. In order to obtain the Soviet Union's support, the proposal has been expanded to a 40-year treaty. When Mr. Byrnes delivered his speech, Molotov and other foreign ministers were in Paris, and it was Mr. Byrnes' first speech after the Wallace incident, so this speech had great significance. Mr. Byrnes echoed Stalin's optimistic view that war will not occur, warning the world not to sow the seeds of future wars at this time. He asked the world to oppose war and things that could cause war, saying that it is not difficult to make everyone recognize the evils of war, but it is not easy to reach an agreement on things that induce war. In a speech in Stuttgart, Mr. Byrnes proposed restoring the German economy and did not agree with the French's proposal to permanently separate the Ruhr area from Germany. Mr. Byrnes replied to the critics, saying that once the 40-year four-power treaty guaranteeing Germany's disarmament goes into effect, the Ruhr area will no longer be a powder keg for Germany or Europe. In the second half of his speech, Mr. Byrnes directly attacked the conflict of opinions between the three powers, saying that ignoring this point will make it more difficult to resolve disputes. Mr. Byrnes said that he would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the belief of the American government and people that all nations can exercise their free will and that the United States does not want to force people to agree or hinder their efforts to improve their social, economic and political situation. He used a part of his speech to respond to Stalin's recent remarks, expressing agreement with Mr. Stalin's statement that there is no danger of war at present. He also said, "I hope that in the future, there will be no more irresponsible accusations against any country or group of countries attempting to encircle the Soviet Union, and the Soviet leaders should not think that way."

Mr. Byrnes tried hard to assure the French that the United States' policy toward Germany would give France security and prevent it from being attacked by Germany. He reiterated the promise he made in Stuttgart that the United States would participate as long as there are occupying forces in Germany. He also promised a long-term occupation of Germany, believing that the Allied occupation could not end until Germany had thoroughly completed its disarmament.

Regarding the recent Wallace incident, Mr. Byrnes only mentioned it indirectly when reviewing the United States' bipartisan foreign policy, saying that this situation will continue to exist regardless of which party is in power. US President Truman has recently made it clear to the world that the foreign policy that was started by the late President Roosevelt and adhered to by Truman will continue to be the policy of the US government. He said that the United States is now determined not to adopt an isolationist policy and is determined to cooperate to maintain peace.

Mr. Byrnes rejected Wallace's theory that the United States has no relationship with Balkan affairs, just as the Soviet Union has no relationship with Latin America. President Roosevelt insisted at the Yalta Conference that the three powers should work together to guarantee the liberation of Europe. He said that Americans have tried twice to avoid participating in European wars, with the theory that they should only take care of their own affairs and not care about European disputes, but as a result, the United States always got involved in the war. This situation must not be allowed to repeat itself, because it is better to prevent each European war in advance than to come out and help end it at the end.

US and Soviet Foreign Ministers Hold Secret Talks; Truman Agrees to the Secretary of State's Policies; Smith Leaves for Moscow Today

[United Press Paris, 3rd] US Secretary of State Byrnes met with Molotov at the Soviet delegation office today for nearly two hours.

US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, one of the delegates attending the peace conference, will go to Moscow this Friday for "private affairs".

[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 3rd, Broadcasting: British Foreign Minister Bevin met with Byrnes at 5:00 PM today after returning to Paris to discuss matters.

[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 3rd, Emergency Broadcasting Washington Dispatch: President Truman had a telephone conversation with Byrnes this morning. He told reporters that he completely agreed with Mr. Byrnes' policies.

[Another Dispatch] Truman told reporters today that he does not intend to deliver a speech on foreign policy in the near future. He also announced that he intends to appoint Lilienthal as the chairman of the US National Atomic Energy Commission. According to his remarks to reporters, there is no plan for a summit meeting of the Big Three at present. He refused to comment on Smith's mission to the Soviet Union and said that he has not yet chosen a new successor to former Ambassador to Britain Harriman.

Regarding Baruch's criticism of Wallace, President Truman refused to comment, saying that this matter only concerns Baruch and Wallace.

Eden's Speech Praises the United Nations Organization

[Agence France-Presse London, 2nd] The "United Nations Week" was recently held here. Former British Foreign Minister Eden gave a speech saying that the United Nations is necessary to maintain world peace. "We cannot avoid friction whether we are in the same parish or on the same street. Therefore, we must find ways to establish world order, otherwise the world will inevitably fall into chaos and turmoil. Any country in the world, no matter how powerful it is or how rich its resources are, will be able to obtain more for its people by cooperating with other countries than by working alone. We certainly need the United Nations organization, but is this organization complete? If all the countries of the United Nations are determined to use this organization, can it achieve our goals?" Our answer is "yes." If the United Nations Charter can be effectively implemented, it will certainly play a role, as was the case with the old League of Nations. We must eliminate international suspicion and hatred in order for the United Nations organization to play its role. In short, we must have a full understanding of the problems we are currently encountering in order to reconcile our ideas and doctrines. We must strive to establish faith and create peace. This is a century-long plan and cannot be achieved overnight. Our lives are limited and we can only witness one stage of it, or perhaps we can witness the final stage. But mankind will surely win."

However, the meeting did not interrupt because of this and did not end until 5:45 AM. More than one representative fell asleep during the meeting.

US Secretary of the Army Strongly Advocates Maintaining a Strong Army as a Strong Backing for Maintaining Peace

[Agence France-Presse San Francisco, 2nd] US Secretary of the Army Patterson recently delivered a speech at the American Legion Convention, advocating that the American people should be forced to serve for half a year, and that the army, navy, and air force should implement merged and unified command. His speech stated: "All those who are 17 years old must be conscripted, and training will begin when they are 18 years old. It is estimated that one million able-bodied men will be conscripted each year, of which 726,000 will be in the army and the remaining 274,000 will be in the navy. However, the youths who are conscripted into the army, although subject to the control of the military authorities, still retain their civilian status. The US standing army cannot be less than one million people. The remaining volunteer army should have 600,000 troops in the land forces and 100,000 troops in the air force. The "National Guard" should also have 682,000 troops. This is the backbone of the US military and should be organized into 70 army divisions and 27 air force groups in accordance with the reserve system. There are two tasks for the standing army: (1) To occupy the enemy territories in Europe and the Pacific to ensure the victory of the Allied forces. (2) If there is an attempt to invade the United States, the standing army must immediately give a head-on blow. Our purpose is not to fully arm the United States and prepare to invade other countries. But past facts have proven that military weakness is very easy to lead to the intrusion of ambitious dictators. In short, we maintain a considerable army as a strong backing for the United Nations organization to maintain world peace. But whether the United States has a strong army still depends on the decision of the American people and Congress."

Nuremberg Civil Court Arrests Three Criminals, Including Papen; Four-Nation Military Commission Studies Execution Methods

[Agence France-Presse Frankfurt, Germany, 3rd] According to news from Nuremberg, the Nuremberg Civil Court Prosecutor has issued arrest warrants for three leading members of the National Socialist Party, Papen, Schacht, and Fritzsche, who were acquitted by the International Military Tribunal.

Nuremberg, 3rd: The German judicial police today sealed off all entrances and exits of the Nuremberg Court to prevent Papen, Schacht, and Fritzsche from leaving the building. The police have been ordered to arrest anyone of the three who tries to escape. After the three were acquitted by the military tribunal, they remained in the courthouse detention center pending permission from the British occupation authorities to leave Nuremberg.

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 3rd, Broadcasting: US military authorities and Bavarian German civil authorities today agreed to allow Papen, Schacht, and Fritzsche to safely pass through to the British occupation zone without threatening them with arrest. Officials in Nuremberg responsible for clearing out Nazi remnants were therefore forced to abandon their order to immediately arrest the three men upon their release from prison. One hundred Bavarian plainclothes policemen had been waiting around the prison, but withdrew as a result of the US military authorities' order.

[United Press Nuremberg, 2nd] After the death sentences of eleven major German war criminals were handed down, the Four-Power Military Commission is today preparing the methods of execution.

The representatives of the Four-Power Military Commission, consisting of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, were designated by the United Nations Control Commission in Berlin and held a secret meeting in court today to discuss the detailed methods of execution.

[United Press Dispatch] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton is expected to become the chairman of the next Board of Governors of the International Bank and Fund, succeeding US Treasury Secretary Snyder.

Senate Petition Delegation Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing; The Petition Results are Extremely Satisfactory; Responding to Sincerity with Sincerity; Sufficient Proof that the Government and the People Can Cooperatively Work Together; To be Proposed and Discussed One by One at the Routine Meeting of the National Defense Council

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Senate's Nanjing Petition Delegation representatives Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, Senators Xi Yushu, Tao Baichuan, Jin Runxiang, Wang Xianqing, Xu Guomao, Liu Jingji, Yu Zuoting, Yang Fusheng, etc., have returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. Representatives Wang Yansong and Luo Qinghua are still in Nanjing. Yesterday, reporters interviewed Senators Xi Yushu, Tao Baichuan, and Wang Xianqing to inquire about their impressions of the petition. All the senators expressed considerable satisfaction. Chairman Chiang and President Song and Minister Gu attached great importance to the various issues raised by the delegation. This trip can be described as worthwhile.

Tao Baichuan told reporters: "The only thing the petition delegation can report with comfort to the citizens of Shanghai upon returning from Nanjing is that the central government is very concerned about this matter." Tao also gave a brief report based on the results of some key requests. Chairman Chiang, after a certain senator stated that the previous petition from the business community did not receive attention from the authorities, stated that there was no such thing. The chairman said that the recent adjustment of foreign exchange rates and tax exemptions for export goods were all improvements made after the business community petitioned. Although the results may not be completely satisfactory, the principle is that the government is willing to adopt public opinion to the best of its ability. The senators also proposed to the Chairman that the Four Joint Offices should be a liaison institution and should not have a regulatory function. Although the Chairman did not express his position at the time, it is observed that the Chairman will also be able to consider this issue.

Regarding the proposal to establish a Shanghai Economic Revitalization Committee, President Song expressed great interest. After the establishment of this kind of organization, other undertakings can also be developed, such as revitalizing the silk industry, hoping to use Japanese artificial silk factories as part of the reparations. However, the houses, sites, and working capital required to operate the factory cannot be handled by a few private financial resources, and the country still needs to provide assistance. Other surplus materials are helpful for construction, and future work is also very difficult. Regarding the delegation's request to improve economic policies, Song also denied that he "only cares about finance and does not care about the economy," but if finance is not emphasized at present, the economy will be even more affected. The government cannot issue more banknotes, but the expenditure is huge, and there are many difficulties, and it is hoped that all parties will understand.

Regarding the petition delegation's request that 50% of the funds from the Enemy Property Administration be allocated for the revitalization of Shanghai, Chen Guofu of the Central Standing Committee believed that the amount may not be too large, because the funds have been included in the national treasury budget, but the representatives' request is also reasonable. It may be possible to reduce the amount requested and use it as a subsidy for Shanghai's construction costs, instead of specifically naming it as the sale of enemy property materials. Chen was extremely concerned about various facilities in Shanghai, saying that the cost of dredging the sewers on various roads in Shanghai and constructing the Pujiang Bridge could not be borne by the citizens of Shanghai.

Regarding the development of agriculture and increasing agricultural products, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs told the delegation that France had requested to order 10,000 dan (tons) of Shaoxing Ping Shuiyuan tea from China to sell to Morocco and other places, but it has not yet been ordered.

It is also heard that Mayor Wu attaches great importance to this matter and specifically invited Tang and Sun to the municipal government yesterday morning at 10:00 AM for a face-to-face discussion. Regarding the content of the meeting, he expressed great approval of the methods for the School Donation and Birthday Celebration and believed that it was particularly appropriate for the people to initiate it voluntarily. He himself will do his best to assist in its success and said: He dares to believe that the Municipal Council, all municipal public organizations, and celebrities from all walks of life will also rise up and advocate for this, so that the achievements of Shanghai's School Donation and Birthday Celebration will not lag behind. Furthermore, the district chiefs have specially scheduled a ninth meeting for this matter to be held at the municipal government at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th of this month, to discuss further active implementation methods. At that time, initiators Tang Zengxie, Sun Dongcheng, Qian Fugong, and others will also be invited to attend and participate in the discussions. The approved draft proposal and speeches are recorded separately below:

5.  Methods for the people of all circles to donate schools will be divided into the following competitions, each held separately: (1) Taking the district as a unit, the district chief of each district will invite enthusiastic people in the district to establish national elementary schools at appropriate locations and present them to the government. (2) Taking the trade association as a unit, each trade association, or several trade associations jointly, will donate a school as a national elementary school. (3) Taking the school as a unit, the principals' association of each private school will present the schools they have already established to the government and convert them into national elementary schools.

Furthermore, the municipal government should be requested to issue memorial certificates for enthusiastic school donation and birthday celebration to encourage them.

Deputy Director Li's Report

Briefly stated that among the proposals from the Municipal Council, the Shanghai school donation movement is the best way to celebrate the Chairman's birthday. Many places have already responded. What is most important domestically and educationally is national education. Shanghai is the area with the strongest economic power, but three-quarters of the children are out of school. It is hoped that each district and central school will accurately count the number of out-of-school children. The Bureau of Education's location may not be suitable, and registration is not fast, so we specially invite you to this meeting. It is best, as the mayor intends, that the people initiate and the municipal government assist.

Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Speech

Briefly stated: I am participating in today's meeting to discuss the methods for donating schools to celebrate the birthday. The non-extravagant and non-wasteful intentions discussed in various newspapers are exactly in line with my own. Director Li's idea that the mayor intends for the people to initiate and the government to assist is very reasonable. Since the time is particularly tight, the Municipal Council has resolved to initiate the proposal through the council, inviting Shanghai public organizations to discuss the birthday celebration plan. Since there are many organizations in Shanghai, we cannot act on our own and must first seek a unified plan. I hope everyone will work hard to achieve the goal.

[This Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch] The Ministry of Education recently noted that the number of elementary and secondary school students has increased sharply, while the original elementary and secondary schools were severely damaged by the enemy during the war.

In order to quickly remedy the situation, the ministry has recently ordered provincial and municipal education bureaus to urgently refer to the established regulations of the two-shift system in elementary schools for secondary schools, adopt its essence, formulate appropriate measures, and implement them as soon as possible. Furthermore, they have ordered that the two-shift system be universally implemented in elementary schools.

An Unexpectedly Tense Situation Relies on the Final Three Free Throws; Qunsheng Defeats Encas

The Expeditionary Force is Tired from Prolonged Fighting and Underestimates the Enemy

Winning by Only Three Points at 31 to 28

[This Newspaper News] Qunsheng Basketball Team's eighth match yesterday was against Encas, one of the top Western teams in Shanghai. The tension of the match greatly exceeded the expectations of the 3,000 fans. Fortunately, Qunsheng relied on the final three free throws to defeat the Westerners. The guest team was tired from prolonged fighting and underestimated the enemy, resulting in a chaotic performance and creating such a situation. The fans wanted to see Qunsheng's basketball skills, so the ticket price was restored to the original price, and the venue was once again full, showing that Qunsheng's appeal has not diminished. The result of the match was that Qunsheng led 22 to 13 in the first half, and the final result was 31 to 28. Although Qunsheng won, it was a narrow victory.

The Foreign General Has Strength and is Willing to Fight

Encas displayed strength throughout the match, showing no signs of fatigue and becoming more and more fierce. This was beyond Qunsheng's expectations. Encas was also able to take advantage of their tall players, Boles and Ge Pengqikoff, to desperately follow up, so they gained many opportunities to possess the ball, and the situation became balanced. In summary, basketball requires sufficient strength to succeed. Encas's victory over Giants and Hualian and their ability to achieve such good results against the guest team are due to this.

Qunsheng Underestimates the Enemy and Panics

The guest team psychologically assumed that they would win, and they were also leading by nine points in the first half, so based on past experience, they would undoubtedly be even more rampant in the second half. Unexpectedly, Encas became more and more courageous, and Qunsheng repeatedly failed to score, gradually becoming panicked. Encas's shots were accurate nine times out of ten, reversing their past style, and the situation worsened. In the last five minutes, Encas tied the score at 28. Fortunately, Encas committed numerous fouls, and the guest team made three of three free throws, securing the victory. Yesterday's results were broadcast live to the Philippines by the Shanghai Radio Station. Overseas Chinese were undoubtedly surprised to hear that Qunsheng's victory over Encas was so tense.

The Westerners Once Surpassed

Before the match, Qunsheng presented the foreign team with a banner as a souvenir. Yesterday's match adopted the first and second half system. Qunsheng started with Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui. Encas started with Bert, Boles, Mahan, Aochailiao, and V Kailuosijin. Cai Wenhua opened the scoring first, Jinzhi made a free throw, and Qunsheng led 3 to 0. However, Encas's Aochailiao made a free throw, and Boles pushed in, tying the score at 3. Yang Renhui hit the bullseye, and V Kailuosiji scored twice, and Encas surpassed 7 to 5. Wenhua made a free throw, Jinde made a great effort, and Renhui shot from afar, and Qunsheng led again 10 to 7. Boles shot in, and the score became 10 to 9, which was quite tense, and Qunsheng called a timeout. The match resumed, and Qunsheng led 15 to 9, gradually gaining the upper hand. Encas called a timeout and replaced Mahan with Ge Pengqiguff. Qunsheng replaced Cai Wenzhang with Zhang Yuyi. The first half ended with Qunsheng leading 22 to 13.

Victory Comes with Great Difficulty

After the break, the match resumed, and there were no personnel changes. Encas's Boles pushed in under the basket, and Qunsheng's Cai Wenhua made a free throw. When Boles scored again, Qunsheng called a timeout. Cai Wenhua entered the court to replace Zhang Yuyi. After the match resumed, Qunsheng's formation suddenly became chaotic. Encas took the opportunity to attack, closely pursuing and refusing to let go. Ge Pengqiguff retaliated, and Aochai Mai made a free throw. Que Libot added icing to the cake. In an instant, the score approached, and Qunsheng led by only 25 to 22, a difference of three points, so they called a timeout. Contact was resumed, and the two sides engaged in close combat. Then each side scored with free throws. Before long, Aochai was dismissed for five fouls, and Ivanoff was supposed to fill the field. Kailuosiji pushed in from the crowd, and the score became 28 points. The atmosphere of the whole match suddenly became tense. Two minutes before the end of the match, Cai Wenzhang, Wenhua, and Jinde each scored with free throws. When the statutory time was over, Qunsheng won 31 to 28, narrowly defeating Encas.

The results of yesterday's match were as follows:

Qunsheng: Fouls, Points

Chen Jinzhi: 2, 7
Cai Wenzhang: 1, 4
Chen Jinde: 2, 6
Cai Wenhua: 3, 8
Yang Renhui: 1, 6
Zhang Yuyi: 0, 0

The Municipal Government has approved a letter from the Ministry of Interior, stating that the revised Article 11 of the Household Registration Law and Articles 28 to 32 of the Implementing Rules have provisions regarding the issuance of national identity cards. Local governments at all levels should issue identity cards to all nationals of the Republic of China who meet the requirements for applying for an identity card. In order to determine the nationality and identity of Chinese nationals, all nationals of the Republic of China who were born in China and whose parents are untraceable or stateless in accordance with Article 1, Section 4 of the Nationality Law, meet the requirements for applying for a national identity card, and have reached the age of applying for a card should be issued cards as a basis for trust.

Household Training in All Districts Completed; Household Re-census Underway

The Seventh District (Changshu) District Office, after being ordered to conduct training for household registration personnel, immediately ordered the cadres of each bao to mobilize for a household re-census, which was completed on the 30th of last month. It is now actively preparing for the household registration transcription work and striving to complete it within the time limit.

The Twenty-first District (Xinshijie) District Office convened a meeting of the bao chiefs and cadres on September 30 to discuss matters related to the re-census of households and scheduled to conduct a general re-census of households in the entire district starting on October 1. The general director and the directors of each section will set out to supervise each bao at any time.

The Twenty-third District (Wusong) District Office held a centralized training for the cadres of each bao and the assistant staff of the household registration section on September 30. Director Ye delivered a speech, and Section Member Hu Renjing of the Civil Affairs Bureau was invited to the district to preside over the training, providing detailed explanations on various issues such as the household re-census and transcription. On October 1, the household re-census and transcription practice will be carried out on site. It is heard that the general household re-census in the district will begin soon.

Change of Bao Chief in the Seventh District

Li Longzhang, the bao chief of the Thirty-fifth Bao of the Seventh District (Changshu), spared no effort in handling education. He suddenly died of encephalitis on the evening of the 27th of last month. His vacancy was filled by Li Yunshan, who was elected by a temporary meeting of the jia chiefs convened by the bao. He has already started working in the bao and has reported to the District Office for forwarding to the Municipal Government for verification and appointment.

Bao Cadre Meeting in the Eleventh District

The Eleventh District (Jing'an) District Office held the eighth Bao Cadre Symposium the day before yesterday, with 41 people attending. After Director Jin delivered a speech as chairman, the directors of each section made work reports one after another. It is heard that the household registration transcription in the district is scheduled to begin on the 2nd of this month. The cadres of each bao are concentrated in the District Office to handle the transcription work.

Household Registration Doubts; Small Group Discussion Record (2)

(1) The number of shantytowns has increased, and the baojia grouping has exceeded the legal number. How should this be handled?

Answer: If there are too many new shantytowns that cannot be attached to the adjacent jia, a new jia may be established. Its jia number is added to the end of the original jia number to avoid changing the order of the original jia number. If the number of jia in the bao is too large, a new bao may not be established.

(2) The population that originally needed to be transcribed into the household registration book or the in-migration registration book has moved elsewhere during the re-census. Should they be transcribed?

Answer: They should still be transcribed. However, it is necessary to consider the circumstances of the move and register them in the out-migration registration book or the floating population registration book.

(3) How should the occupations of brokers and middlemen be classified?

Answer: Brokers and middlemen should be classified as commerce (brokerage and referral services).

(4) Under the same host, living together in the same place and operating a joint business are regarded as joint business households in accordance with Article 8 of the Shanghai Municipal Household Registration Handling Rules. Now there is a household that has both a joint business and lives together, but there is no signboard. How should its household type be determined?

Answer: Households of this type without signboards should still be regarded as cohabitation households.

Blood and Rain in Sixian

Guzhen News, September 15

Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

When this reporter arrived, I heard a weaver say: The Eighth Route Army wants the old people to work for them, giving them three meals a day. At breakfast, at least two fried dough sticks, and during the busy farming season, there must be wine and meat, and each person only has to work eight hours. How can this be? When we harvest wheat, we are in the fields even at night, not even sleeping, fearing that the wheat will explode if we are even a moment late. We eat a little worse, and they want us to fight the bosses. But if we work for the Eighth Route Army, we have to bring our own food and work all day long. We can't take care of the crops. Owner Chang can't deceive people anymore, saying that we don't want our fields anymore, but it's not right to say it that way. We should say that we are dedicating it to our government. The Eighth Route Army says they don't want it, but they always instigate this and that to fight, taking away all the fields. They must fight until everyone is often with the Eighth Route Army to be considered good."

The Sorrow of the Si River

The Communist Army is currently encouraging people to join the army, which in other words is "military first." Lingsi is an area for military entry and exit, with barren fields and scattered people, so it is left to its own devices. Although this reporter has not heard the Communist Army directly put forward the slogan of proletarian revolution as a call to action, the slogan "The Poor Shall Overturn" can be seen everywhere this time. After the victory of the national war of resistance, emphasizing the overturning of the poor is essentially no different from directly putting forward the proletarian revolution. The national war of resistance is available, but it is almost impossible to achieve national construction today?

I arrived in Sixian three days after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Vice Minister Hong Lanyou inspected the flood while riding in the military vehicle, passing through Lingbi. This reporter took a ride to Si.

Vice Minister Hong's inspection of the northeastern flood area of the hospital, the local authorities all entertained them with great enthusiasm, but there were also exaggerations that were inappropriate. Elementary school students in Sixian also participated in the suburban welcome, holding small flags and waiting in lines on the left side of the road, bowing deeply to the group of people pouring out of the car and daring not to look up. This is really harmful to people and the country! Several old women knelt down and kowtowed to Hong and his party at the city gate. I felt that this was the 18th century, the result of one or two decades of political tutelage? When the car entered Sixian City, there was a civilian who walked out of each house to light firecrackers. In an instant, the sound of firecrackers resounded throughout Sixian City, which was immersed in a bloody storm.

In the Battle of Sixian, the Communist Army suffered more than 10,000 casualties, and the National Army also suffered more than a few thousand casualties. This reporter patrolled the entire city, with flies flying everywhere and a stench permeating the air. In a small town, thousands of corpses were buried inside and outside the city. Some corpses have recently been dragged out of several broken houses. If this reporter had not come here, it would have been difficult to believe that there were such heavy casualties. The stench of corpses, the humid wind, and the epidemic were rampant, threatening thousands of residents. Although the great war had passed a month ago, it was still turbulent. At midnight on the 7th of last month, the Communist Army suddenly broke into the Xiaobeimen in one fell swoop, occupying fortresses and civilian houses. Because there was a city moat outside the city, they then occupied the Dabeimen. Only the county government was a corridor area between the two gates. Qin Guozhi of the National Army drove from Wuhe to the city at dawn on the 8th. He brought heavy artillery to the foot of the city behind the county government to attack the side of the Communist Army. The range of the artillery shells was only 50 meters. This reporter only saw close-range street fighting with heavy artillery in the Battle of Hengyang. From this, the fierce fighting situation can be seen. After the Xiaobeimen bunker was recaptured, the National Army went out of the city and attacked around it to block the Dabeimen, and the Communist Army was encircled and annihilated. Under the machine guns and heavy artillery, half of the city was completely destroyed.

Regimental Commander Qin Xiangrong guided this reporter to inspect various places. The villages outside the Xiaobeimen and Dabeimen were all in ruins, and many civilians were buried in the artillery fire. It is still impossible to count the number of casualties. According to local sources, civilian casualties were at least 2,000. One must ask: For whom is the blood shed?

A month ago, Sixian was a city of blood; now it is a city of bloody storms. This reporter accompanied Regimental Commander Qin in the direction of Dabeimen, passing through the Confucius Temple, and a strong stench of blood assaulted them, almost causing them to faint. A militiaman mumbled to himself in front of a dilapidated well in the ruins: "He couldn't escape and jumped in here. I fished for a while and only fished up a piece of meat. Let's fill it with soil. He is considered to have the best burial."

Generally, too many corpses were buried too shallowly, so the stench of corpses was pervasive and unbearable to stay. Flies were flying around, and although this reporter had not eaten for a day, I dared not eat in Sixian.

The Communist Army used 21 regiments to attack Sixian, centering on Sixian, and launched offensives against the surrounding towns, such as Haochengji and Changzhigou. The purpose was to rebuild strongholds here to block the National Army's eastward advance and to encircle and annihilate the National Army that penetrated eastward from Sixian in one fell swoop, so as to ensure the west bank of the Grand Canal. Now, however, the surprise troops have failed. After the defeat in Sixian, the entire army collapsed and retreated. The west bank of the Grand Canal was not defended, and this road of the National Army directly approached Yanghe Siyang, chasing it to the suburbs of Huaiyin City.

This reporter wants to add a few observations from this trip to Huaishang here as an ending:

Difficult to Reverse

When I turned back to the port, I heard that Vice Minister Hong Lanyou of the Ministry of Social Affairs would be ordered to come to northeastern Anhui to provide disaster relief. Director Huang Tongchou of the Civil Affairs Department and Chairman Li Pinxian arrived in Bengbu from Hefei one after another, and the special commissioners and county magistrates of various places also rushed over, thus raising a cry for disaster relief. Everyone was waiting for the arrival of the central officials. However, the common people have been immersed in water for two months, and the township levies and taxes are as usual. When the magistrate of Shou County inspected Banfu at Zhengyangguan, he said to the town chief before leaving: I have not received any entertainment from the local authorities. If you use my name to make apportionments, you will be severely punished. After the county magistrate boarded the ship, because there was not enough coal, the town government sent some coal. Afterwards, it was immediately apportioned to

Honoring War Veterans
Shao Fu

Can We Let Them Beg on the Streets?

Yesterday, I received a letter like this from a friend:

"Today (October 2nd) at 7:00 PM, I saw six honored war veterans begging along Tianjin Road. Four of them indeed had only one leg each, relying on crutches to walk. The other two, however, were very strong. When they arrived at a store, the one who was not injured opened his mouth to the cashier, requesting help and explaining that they were brothers from the ××× Division. The other one tried to drive away the children who were watching the excitement. Honored war veterans begging on the streets, this is such a national disgrace! Now that the war of resistance has been won, is there no way to care for these people who were disabled for the sake of the war? Because no matter what, those four legless men, at first glance, you can tell they were soldiers, not saying a word, they looked so genuine and honest!

But what I suspect is that the person who spoke up, he was quite fat, his head was shiny with oil, he didn't look like a soldier. He's so kind to help them beg, I'm deeply afraid that these honorable veterans, when they have no other choice, are being taken advantage of. And if they join forces with local ruffians, the result will be very dangerous.

I hope the security authorities will investigate. If they are not being exploited, these four honored war veterans should be sent to state-established institutions so that they can live and be managed. The other two should be sent to the appropriate place, or else this kind of emerging beggar gang should be suppressed.

From the standpoint of national dignity, soldiers cannot beg for food; from the standpoint of conscience, even from a practical standpoint, the lives of honored war veterans should be guaranteed and their lives managed."

My friend's letter has already made it clear enough. My opinion on this matter is the same. I wonder if the city's security agencies have paid attention to this?

Written on World Animal Day

Zheng Fan

In the current situation of hardship and popular distress, it is almost forgotten that today is "World Animal Day."

The origin of World Animal Day is as follows: As early as 1822, British Member of Parliament Martin proposed to the government to protect animals and organized the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. In 1835, it received the strong support of Queen Victoria of England, and the Parliament passed a law protecting all domestic animals and wild beasts. The work of "protecting animals" then proceeded smoothly. Germany, the United States, France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, and other countries successively established animal protection organizations. On the centennial of Mr. Martin's death, various countries agreed to designate October 4th of each year as World Animal Day.

The earliest animal protection organization in China was the "Shanghai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals," founded by Westerners. On February 25, 1934, the "China Animal Protection Association" was officially established in Shanghai. According to the association's proclaimed purpose, it aimed to "promote inherent morality, stop or reduce the killing behavior of mankind, and protect the lives and freedom of animals." The work it carried out included promoting animal protection, requesting the government to ban the killing of stray dogs, establishing releasing gardens, and employing veterinarians.

At that time, whenever Animal Day came around, they were always busy convening propaganda meetings, performing entertainment, holding animal protection painting and calligraphy exhibitions, publishing special issues in various newspapers, soliciting animal protection articles, etc., and the Ministry of Interior issued a notice to all butchers to uniformly ban slaughtering for one day!

In this society where "people kill people," to shout "protect animals" on the one hand is indeed a comical contrast. Of course, protecting life is always a move that "benefits the world and people's hearts," but how much effect can it have?

Here, I happen to think of two "thought-provoking" stories!

Mussolini issued a very strict decree, teaching people to protect the birds on the Lipari Islands. The "Great Britain Bird Lovers Association" therefore sent Mussolini a gold medal, praising him as a "benevolent protector of birds." But at the same time, many political prisoners were suffering on the Lipari Islands.

There is also a story that when the German National Socialist Party was frantically massacring Jews, the Danish Animal Protection Association sent Hitler a letter of thanks: "When Your Excellency ordered to prohibit the slaughter of livestock using Jewish sacrificial methods, we deeply appreciate your benevolence."

Friends, what are your thoughts after reading these two facts? This world has already reached the point where one has the power to ignore humans and only care for birds and beasts! In the current situation where flames of war are everywhere and human lives are as cheap as grass, "protecting animals" seems to be just an act of "womanly kindness"! Of course, this is a "timely" "grumble," but even though it is a "cliche," it is enough to make us feel sentimental!

Odds and Ends

w w

If horse racing becomes a reality, dogs and tigers will have to "flatter the horse," praising the old horse for knowing the way and its contribution to the animal kingdom. Why? Because the dog racing track will be restored, the one-armed bandit will be stirring after a long period of silence, and perhaps "Da Sheng" and "Green Treasure" and other gambling dens will also be revived. All of this will be led by the horse!

"All occupations are inferior, only studying is noble." Where is it noble? Tuition is high, book fees are high, public service ladies are arrogant, fashionable coats have high shoulders, school owners have high eyes, teachers have high cheekbones, wages are high... Climbing high on the Double Ninth Festival is well-founded; do you feel the humility that comes from climbing high?

Workers petition, dance hall troupes petition, monks petition, rickshaw pullers petition... You petition, I grant, but judging from the general situation, there is no great effect. Teachers are sensible and no longer insist on what they "petitioned" for, it has become wishful "thinking." The "situation" is unsightly; only tighten your belts. "Heaven" ah, "Heaven" ah, shout to the heavens, hoping for such a day: "Heaven" will grant people's "wishes"!

National Goods
Xiao Tian

People need clothes, Buddhas need gold. These words seem to have become a decorative saying since ancient times. Here comes good news for civil servants. The municipal government, in order to ensure that the civil servants of various bureaus are neatly dressed, will tailor uniforms using American "Melton" woolen fabric. If it is really done well, regardless of the size of the official, each person will get a set of winter clothing, which is both neat and generous. The material is good, and it is beautiful, and it will indeed give outsiders an envious smile. The price is not expensive, and the total cost of labor and materials is 94,500 yuan. If customs duties can be waived, it can be reduced. The price looks good, cheap and cost-effective, at least five or six million yuan cheaper than having it custom-made at a store. However, thinking carefully, the labor is paid to the Chinese, but the clothing material comes from the richest country in the world, the United States.

Newspapers often report on adjusting foreign exchange rates to prevent the dumping of foreign goods, and cracking down on street vendors is also for the benefit of domestic goods merchants. Moreover, they vigorously promote domestic goods to save the industrial and commercial crisis. I can't help but ask, why does the Shanghai municipal government use imported clothing materials for the uniforms of its staff? Why? ... Perhaps they will say that this is to take care of the civil servants' finances and to get a bargain, because imported goods are cheaper than domestic goods! Pointing this out naturally involves some "nitpicking," but thinking carefully, the authorities at least have some contradictions!

Also thinking that domestic goods merchants are also promoting domestic goods on the one hand, while passing off as foreign goods on the other. This is indeed "an era where everything should be re-evaluated."

Hard to Live in America

Automobile Converted into Apartment

Yu Qiang

It is not only Shanghai that is suffering from a housing shortage, but all of China is suffering from a housing shortage. Even the United States, which has not been ravaged by artillery fire, is also suffering from a housing shortage. How do they solve this thorny problem? Here are a few examples of "ingenious methods," specially recorded for compatriots who are looking for houses but have neither gold bars nor the ability to tear off seals:

Private Ma Han, a veteran from Michigan, and his newlywed wife worked together to find a home, but all efforts were in vain. So they bought an abandoned 55-foot-high chimney, dismantled it, and obtained 42,000 bricks. Then they used these bricks to build a house themselves.

Another veteran, Anderson, rented a "playhouse." This "playhouse" was a luxury toy for a rich man's child, built forty years ago. The bathtub inside the house is three feet long and one and a half feet wide, and there is also a flower room, which is two and a half feet long. Anderson is six feet tall. But he said, "As long as there is a place to settle down, I am willing to crawl in on my hands and knees."

Miss Bunati of Santa Monica, California, now lives in a "beachfront apartment" converted from a double-decker bus. This bus was discarded by the Los Angeles Railway Company. Miss Bunati also sunbathes on the top floor!

At the end of a 308-foot flagpole near Coshocton, Ohio, Jacob solved his housing problem. He built a "nest" at the top of the pole, which is also equipped with a radio, lights, a telephone, an electric stove for cooking, and a roof to shield from wind and rain. Wonderful!

Puyi's Sister-in-Law

Jie Qi

From the news of "Puyi's younger brother," I thought of Puyi's sister-in-law.

"Puppet Emperor" Puyi had four younger siblings. His younger brother, Puyi Jie, moved to "Manchukuo" with his brother in 1932 and participated in the first batch of students sent to Japan by the puppet state. He was also a completely shameless puppet.

Pujie had a wife named Tang Shixia, a new woman. During her husband's "study abroad," it was rumored that she and a boyfriend, Lu Xiaojia, were cohabiting at the Beijing Six Nations Hotel. Puyi's father, Zai Feng, found out, requested the Public Security Bureau to arrest them, and pursued the more than three million yuan of property that had been "forcibly taken away." At that time, it was November 27, 1932, and Tang Shixia had already fled without a trace on the morning of the 26th.

However, on February 14, 1933, a former Qing aristocrat in Beijing suddenly received a long letter from Tang Shixia, recounting the events in great detail. Only a section of the original letter was found out. The original text is as follows: "(The above is omitted) Xia and her husband have a very good relationship. Since he went to Japan to study, Xia has been alone in Beijing for several years, dealing with everything externally and handling general affairs internally, enduring hardship and resentment. Eunuch servants and evil slaves especially provoked discord at will. Her father-in-law listened to slanderous words and often made idle remarks. This is what Xia cannot tolerate. Puyi was taken east by the Japanese. Xia had previously wept and begged her father-in-law, but her father-in-law accused Xia of being nosy. This is why Xia had to leave the mansion alone and willingly drift to another country. Xia once declared that she would rather be a wandering soul of China than a noble of the puppet emperor, so going to Changchun is really impossible. Externally, because of our marital affection, I have come to Shanghai to join Xia, Xia would not find it difficult to run around on her behalf, and there is still a place for her to stand. Otherwise, if she fails once, she will be disgraced along with me, leaving the world to spit on her, and she will never have a place to stand at home or abroad. (The following is omitted)"

Whether Puyi's sister-in-law, Tang Shixia, was an adulterous woman or a remarkable woman is really impossible to judge based on one-sided statements. However, puppet families are prone to scandals, which is quite fitting.

Low Key

Ge Zhen

Both were Nazi war criminals: some were sentenced to prison, and some (like Papen) were acquitted. It can be seen that the world is so big, and there are so many races, and their luck and misfortune are completely different. However, if you allow me to make a prediction: Papen's future is also not optimistic. Although he smiled through tears in the Nuremberg court today, he forgot that there is a Russian saying: "He who laughs last, laughs best!"

Father and son enter the "li" ("doing evil and violating li"!) as new characters: Chen Nifu Min, the president of the puppet organization Suzhou High Court, is from Suzhou Yuan, and has now died suddenly due to heart disease. His son, Chen Nizhan Ru, the puppet Suzhou County magistrate, who is in prison, actually requested bail to attend the funeral, in order to fulfill his so-called "filial piety." The judge immediately strongly refuted him, saying: "How can a traitor still have any "filial piety" to speak of?" A single sentence hit the nail on the head, so satisfying! So satisfying!

At the same time, from the mouth of Chen Nizhan Ru, we can also examine the deep psychology and absurd concept of the traitor, which has a great sense of "regardless of right and wrong, a father is always a father." If we break it down, all the acts of "recognizing a thief as a father" mostly stem from this absurd concept.

Zhou Fohai and Ding Mocun, the "two public figures" among the "traitorous nobles," were finally sent to the capital. When they were sent there, they took airplanes and brought chefs. After they entered prison, they continued to read novels and write articles, as if they were quite comfortable. The public expressed surprise, disdain, or even envy at their seemingly inexhaustible "wealth and glory." A reporter asked Ding Ni: "Are you free!"

Ding Ni replied: "Free? Sending us east and sending us west, how can we talk about any freedom?" His words seemed to regret not being free enough.

Since you want freedom, why did you start it in the first place? We want to ask this question.

Such a Style

Sacred

The morning of three days ago, I was returning from wiring money from the bank, and I was passing Nanjing Road. The red light was on, and pedestrians and vehicles traveling north and south all stopped and waited for the green light to appear before proceeding. Unexpectedly, when the green light just came on, pedestrians and vehicles were preparing to pass quickly; at this time, a jeep actually insisted on rushing through. It thought that these pedestrians were too ignorant, why don't they even recognize the Atomic Tiger? It took revenge and stepped on the gas, crossed the line, and rampaged wildly toward the pedestrians on the road. Its meaning was very simple: let these pedestrians know the power of the jeep. Judging from the driver's attitude, he fully demonstrated his arrogance and囂張. His evil look seemed to wish he could crush a few small lives to his heart's content. After his car passed, he turned his head and scanned these pedestrians with his piercing eyes, boasting of his awe-inspiring power. I mourned for the Atomic Tiger, and I was afraid for the lives of ordinary citizens!

### News Figure

Chief Secretary of Civil Affairs Wu Dingchang

Zheng Fan

From Industrial Tycoon to Important Government Official

Wu Dingchang, the Chief Secretary of Civil Affairs of the Chinese government during the ongoing peace talks, is a "target" for news reporters. Regarding any news about the KMT-CPC negotiations, the Marshall banquet, and what policies the Chinese government will adopt, when reporters are waiting at the door, the first "news figure" to be hunted down is often Chief Secretary Wu. And Wu's answer often seems to make reporters feel that it is "not without gain," and he always says about the current national situation: "Still very optimistic!"

Wu's given name is Daquan. Speaking of Wu Daquan, Shanghai people all know that he is a tycoon in the financial world, and he had already achieved a leading position in the economic circles of North China in his early years. He served as the General Manager of the Fengtian Benxi Lake Coal Mining Company, the General Manager of the Jiangxi Daqing Bank, the Supervisor of the China Bank, the Supervisor of the Mint, and the General Manager of the Yanye Bank. But his most proud achievement was the success of the Four Banks Savings Association, which he managed. At that time, the results were considered the best in the banking industry.

Abandoning Business to Join Politics

In the winter of 1935, the National Government organized a cabinet of talents, and Wu succeeded Chen Gongbo as the Minister of Industry, and from then on, he "abandoned business to join politics" and took on practical administrative responsibilities. (Wu had also previously served as a Councilor of the State Council and Vice Minister of Finance, but he had always focused on industry and commerce.) In the New Year of the following year, Wu wrote "Work Guidelines After the New Year," expressing his aspirations. The general idea of the article was: "Horizontally, cooperate and divide labor with relevant agencies to achieve the effect of different paths leading to the same goal; vertically, support private enterprises and formulate various new constructions." Judging from the work achievements later shown by the Ministry of Industry, it proved that his words were not "blowing smoke."

During his time as the head of the Ministry of Industry, there was also one thing worth recording, which was his advocacy of the "one person, one name system." He suggested to the Legislative Yuan, giving many reasons. At the time, it caused a lot of repercussions and discussions, but before long, it quietly disappeared without any follow-up. In June of that year, the Shanghai Cloth Exchange was in a turmoil of manipulation. Wu came to Shanghai personally to investigate the truth. Who knew that after reviewing the account books, it was discovered that those account books were full of clan names and nicknames, and the cunning and treacherous people were difficult to figure out. From this, it can also be seen that Wu's "one person, one name system" did have considerable reasons.

Chairman of Guizhou Province

After the war, the National Government moved inland, and Wu was transferred to be the Chairman of Guizhou Province, on the one hand, consolidating the rear, and on the other hand, developing Guizhou's mineral resources. The people of Guizhou have always been extremely afraid of "fighting," but Wu tried every possible way to encourage them, and was able to draw 300,000 strong men every year. He also trained the Miao people in the Xiangqian border area and organized them into divisions and regiments to participate in the battle.

Wu is from Huayang, Sichuan, and is a fellow villager with Zhang Qun. Both of them have deep roots in Sichuan. When Liu Xiang was in charge of Sichuan, he was ordered to enter Sichuan to discuss the political and economic reform of Sichuan Province, and at that time, rumors were rife in Sichuan, and Wu Dingchang and Zhang Qun were both the most noticed figures by all parties.

Looking at Wu's life and career, whether he was running a business or "being an official," everything went smoothly. There is also one masterpiece that Wu considers the most successful, which is the Ta Kung Pao, which everyone knows. Therefore, Wu is actually an industrialist, financier, and "journalist" at the same time. He has a considerable amount of "capital."

Wu graduated from Tokyo Higher Commercial School in Japan, and his wife is also Japanese. In the past, some people called Wu a "pro-Japanese faction" or called him a "Japan expert." In fact, Wu did his work with more perseverance than anyone else. Perhaps the reason why he was "bestowed" with such a harsh name was precisely because of the above reasons!

### Jiangsu High Court to Establish Two Branch Courts

[Report from our Zhenjiang correspondent] The First Branch of the High Court, the highest judicial organ in the provincial capital, was ordered to be established in May of this year. In recent months, the work has been extremely heavy. In order to understand the general situation of the judiciary in this province, the reporter specially visited Chief Secretary Xia of the First Branch of the High Court on the 2nd. He learned that the highest judicial institution in the province is the Suzhou High Court. The High Court has four branch courts, named in numerical order. The one located in the provincial capital is the First Branch. The Second Branch is stipulated to be located in Huaiyin. However, because Huaiyin has been occupied by the Communist army for a long time and traffic is blocked, the High Court has temporarily assigned the jurisdiction of the Second Branch to the First Branch. Therefore, in addition to its own jurisdiction, this court also handles cases in the jurisdiction of the Second Branch. Now that Huaiyin has been recovered by the National Army and order is gradually stabilizing, the High Court has dispatched personnel to prepare for its establishment. The Third Branch is located in Xuzhou and was officially established in February of this year. The Fourth Branch is located in Nantong, and the High Court has also sent personnel to prepare for its establishment.
