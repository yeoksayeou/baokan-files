### Military Mediation Department Commemorates Fu Yi; Ye Jianying Postpones Departure from Peiping; Xuzhou Team Departs for Zaozhuang for Inspection

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Special Dispatch] After the cessation of conflict, postal services in the Communist-controlled areas of the Jiaoji, Jinpu, Pinghan, and Longhai lines are planned to be restored as soon as possible. Communist generals in various regions have submitted requests to the Military Mediation Department for postal purchases, supplementary clothing, and the addition of medicines to resist the various demands of the legal currency easy to obtain. The representatives of the National Army of the Military Mediation Department's executive teams have no authority to deal with the exchange of legal tender for a while, but they can express their agreement to other matters. As long as the Communist army fulfills its promise to restore traffic quickly in various places, everything can be discussed at length.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] Ye Jianying was originally scheduled to go to Yanan for instructions today, but the trip was postponed due to the lack of aircraft. Today morning, the Executive Department suspended the routine Chief of Staff meeting to commemorate Fu Yi, and no communiqu√© was issued. Some major decisions may be made after the Spring Festival. As of now, no principles seem to have been established for the resumption of traffic negotiations.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] According to the report from the Suiyuan Team, there have been no conflicts in Suiyuan Province except for the Communist army's disturbance in Taolin on the 20th. The Communist army has stopped destroying the Pingsui Railway. Only Jining and Zhuozishan are impassable on the entire line. The Guisui east line is open to Qixiaying. Many water towers between Baotou and Guisui have been destroyed, making driving quite difficult. The Jining Team investigated that 20,000 tons of copper wire were cut off from the road's power line, and thousands of electric poles and a large number of sleepers were damaged.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] According to the report from the Suiyuan Team, the people of Guisui are eager for peace, and the price is also unstable. Each catty of white flour costs about 150 yuan. The people cannot eat their fill or keep warm, and they are suffering greatly. Jining is still stationed by the Communist army, and the city is still peaceful, but it is very desolate. The Northwestern Agricultural and Industrial Bank notes of the CCP, the legal tender, and the pseudo-Mongolian border bills are used in the market. The exact exchange rate has not been determined, and prices are lower than in Peiping.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 31st] The Xuzhou Team of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters has been visiting various conflict locations for inspection in recent days. The government representative Xie Muzhuang, the Communist army representative Wu Juying, and the US representative Harryke flew to Yixian by special plane at 9:30 on the morning of the 31st, and then took a bus to Zaozhuang to inspect the situation there.

### Transportation Situation on the Border of Jin-Ji-Cha; Xinhua News Agency's Publication

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] Amid the calls to resume traffic, the "Xinhua News Agency," the CCP's news agency that started publishing here last week, reported on the efforts of the CCP's "Liberated Areas" in transportation construction. This is indeed a very informative news item. It is said that: "Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Area Transportation Bureau has dispatched personnel to work with the Pingsui Railway Line Administration to resume railway traffic. In addition to changes in train times and increased frequency, there is now direct traffic between Yanggao and Huailai. Road construction and bridge building are now being designed and implemented for the long term." It also stated: "The Pingsui Railway Bureau is also preparing to set a full-line restoration plan from Peiping to Baotou, collecting materials, and preparing to start construction immediately. Except for the longer time required for bridge repair, other line projects can be completed and opened to traffic in a short period of time." According to its third manuscript, Zhangjiakou has now become the center of the CCP-controlled area for the highway. It can extend to Xingxian, the heart of the Jin-Sui Border Area, with a total length of 2,500 li. The six major highway lines are as follows: (1) From Zhangjiakou via Zhangbei to Shangyi. (2) From Zhangjiakou via Suiyuan Xinghe to Fengzhen. (3) From Zhangjiakou via Tianzhen, Yanggao to Fengzhen, and from Tianzhen via Zuoyun, Wuzhai to Xingxian. (4) From Zhangjiakou via Xuanlongguan Luewubao to Anjiangtun in Rehe, and then via Luanping to Chengde. (5) From Zhangjiakou via Huailai, Yanqing to Tanghekou in Rehe, and then to Chengde. (6) From Zhangjiakou via Xuanhua Xiheying to Laiyuan Xixielingqiu, and south to Zoumayi. Its sixth manuscript stated: "The Jizhong Liberated Area is now actively engaged in transportation construction. The automobile roads that can now be used are: (1) The Pingda Highway (starting from Daxing Lixian, passing through Gu'an, Baxian, Xinzhen, Renqiu, Raoyang, Shenxian, Xinji to Matou Lizhen in Ningjin), crossing more than 600 li in the Jizhong Plain, and connecting with the Jinnan District of Ji-Lu-Yu.

### Peiping's Arrest of Japanese War Criminals; Work Progresses Very Slowly

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] The work of arresting Japanese war criminals in Peiping is progressing very slowly. As of today, only more than 50 people have been arrested and detained in the 11th War Zone War Criminal Detention Center. The authorities in charge of the war zone stated that the original number of war criminals to be arrested by order of the Military Commission was more than 170, but they cannot be arrested due to transportation problems. It is reported that recently, various legal groups, agencies, and the public have reported war criminals, and several have begun to be interrogated. However, many only know the war criminal's surname but not their name, so the crimes are difficult to clarify for a while. The military tribunal for interrogating war criminals is composed of three judicial officers from the military law office. After the judicial officers are all present, the trial can be formally opened.

### More Than 20,000 Unemployed Technicians in Hankou

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 31st Special Dispatch] Many factories in Chongqing have closed down, and many technicians who have returned to their hometowns have been laid off.

At the moment, the first batch of more than 200 unemployed workers has arrived in Hankou by wooden boat. Together with the original unemployed technicians in Wuhan, there are more than 20,000 people. The special commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs here is trying to take care of them. In addition, hundreds of Yi soldiers petitioned the Relief Association yesterday, calling for relief.

Editorial

### Political Consultative Conference Successfully Concludes

The Political Consultative Conference, convened on the 10th of last month, lasting 22 days, successfully concluded at 8:30 PM on the 31st. During these 22 days, the people of the entire nation paid close attention to the proceedings of the Political Consultative Conference. Under the unified slogan of "Only success is permitted, failure is not," the successful establishment of important agreements and the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference is truly the only exciting and gratifying event since the surrender of the Japanese and the victory in the War of Resistance. Throughout the more than 20 days of the conference, all parties were able to be mutually accommodating, allowing the conference to proceed smoothly in a harmonious and coordinated atmosphere. This demonstrates how all parties were able to set aside personal opinions for the sake of the overall situation. This spirit of coordination is truly worth celebrating. After a long period of war, the Chinese people are in dire need of an opportunity to rest and recuperate in order to achieve national rejuvenation. The surrender of the Japanese and the victory in the War of Resistance was good news, making it clear to them that the Chinese nation's mortal struggle with Japan for national freedom had victoriously ended. This excited them. But before long, this excitement dissipated due to the shadows of actual political issues within the country. Therefore, they placed ardent hopes on the Political Consultative Conference convened to eliminate these political shadows, hoping that the consultation would yield results and that the Chinese people would have an opportunity to recuperate and rebuild. The reason the Political Consultative Conference was able to achieve a successful outcome is that we must attribute it to the participants of the PCC who prioritized the nation and the people, setting aside personal opinions. Today, as we prepare to implement constitutional government, this democratic style of mutual accommodation is particularly worthy of our praise.

The agreements reached by the Political Consultative Conference consist of five aspects: first, regarding government organization; second, regarding the program of governance; third, regarding military issues; fourth, regarding the National Assembly; and fifth, regarding the constitutional draft. Looking at the established agreements, all of them respect the national system while taking into account objective facts. For example, the agreement on government organization strengthens the power of the National Government Committee, adjusts the organization of the National Government Committee members, increases the number of members to 40, with half being Kuomintang members and half being non-Kuomintang members, and establishes political affairs committee members under the Executive Yuan. All of these are appropriate adjustments to the current political system. This adjustment, on the one hand, can satisfy the desire of various parties and factions to participate in the government in a practical way, and on the other hand, it is sufficient to fulfill the Kuomintang's long-held desire to treat the nation as a public trust. At the same time, it is also sufficient to live up to the great kindness of our allied nations in supporting a strong, unified, and democratic China.

In addition, the convening of the National Assembly was originally a focal point of contention during the conference. The agreement now reached allows the National Assembly to be convened as scheduled, thereby maintaining the government's credibility. At the same time, in order to adapt to the current situation, the number of representatives has been expanded to allow various parties, factions, and social elites to participate as much as possible, which is also a wise decision. The remaining governance programs, military issues, and constitutional drafts have all been decided based on the spirit of coordination and mutual accommodation. The efforts of the participants in this Political Consultative Conference should have eliminated the current political problems. We believe that these agreements are not merely written documents, nor are they effective only in certain areas. They will certainly be faithfully and universally implemented in the spirit of the agreements. Observing that this consultative conference was able to proceed smoothly and conclude successfully, we firmly believe that these agreements will be faithfully implemented and promoted throughout the country, and will never become an unfulfilled promise.

However, when it comes to the importance of the various agreements reached by the PCC, none surpasses the Program for National Reconstruction and Governance. The other agreements concerning government organization, military issues, and the constitutional draft can all be said to be based on the Program for National Reconstruction and Governance as the fundamental center. This is a turning point that builds on the past and looks to the future. Since this program was jointly formulated by the various parties and factions and social elites participating in the PCC, it should be the preparation for peaceful nation-building in the future, similar to the "Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction" during the War of Resistance. In Chairman Chiang's closing address to the PCC, we saw the Chairman say: "I believe that among all the proposals, the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction should be regarded as the fundamental center of all the proposals, because the various provisions of this case, from the general principles to the people's rights, to politics, to military affairs, to foreign affairs, to economy and finance, to education and culture, to post-war relief, to overseas Chinese affairs, etc., in nine chapters, are extremely complete, truly in line with the needs of the times, full of unity, full of democracy, and truly the most appropriate program for transitioning to the constitutional era. With this program, from the central government to all local governments throughout the country, from all parties and factions and social leaders to compatriots throughout the country, we have a common standard to follow. In particular, the various parties and factions participating in this conference have discussed and agreed upon this program together, and will participate in the government to implement it together." It can be seen how important the formulation of the Program for National Reconstruction and Governance is in the current political situation.

As Chairman Chiang said in his closing address to the PCC, since this program was jointly formulated by the various parties and factions participating in the association and social elites, this program must also apply equally to the areas where the CCP's troops are stationed. In the CCP's stationed areas, it should also "ensure that the people enjoy freedom of body, thought, religion, belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, migration, and communication." At the same time, since political parties can now operate openly, there should be no more acts of armed rebellion or secret organization in various places. Regarding the nationalization of the CCP's troops, since there is a provision in this Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, it must be earnestly implemented. All national troops, regardless of party affiliation or region, should obey the command of the government to achieve the standards of unified military orders, military administration, and military and political command.

The successful conclusion of the PCC coincided with the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve. "The sound of firecrackers removes the old," and everything in the past is wished to vanish with the sound of firecrackers. Thereafter, spring returns to the earth, which is also a good opportunity for us to remove the old and bring forth the new in politics, a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. Party politics will once again emerge in China. May all the past bad phenomena of all political parties since the Republic of China disappear with the old year. We sincerely hope that China can become stronger, more unified, and more democratic under the recognized Three Principles of the People as the supreme principle of nation-building.

The Economic and Security Councils and the Trusteeship Committee will all meet today, so today will be a busy day. In addition, the Military Staff Committee, which controls the United Nations forces, is also scheduled to meet today, but it has not been officially announced whether the Soviet representative will be able to arrive in time, otherwise a postponement will be inevitable.

Furthermore, the Indonesian issue is expected to be left for discussion at the next meeting. Lundis came to England from Athens, presumably carrying new instructions from the government, fearing that he would not be able to consult with Foreign Secretary Bevin before the meeting. Responsible observers expect that Lundis will not support the claims of his predecessor, Soyanopoulos, who believed that the dispute between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Greek issue should be resolved through direct negotiations.

[Associated Press, London, 1st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin will respond to the Soviet Union's complaint. The content will depend on the Soviet Union's remarks, but Bevin "does not want a duel," he said.

### Trusteeship Council Election to Be Held in the United States

[Reuters, London, 1st] The election of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, as well as the establishment of international institutions to protect former League of Nations mandated territories and other dependent lands, will have to wait until the second half of the United Nations General Assembly's first meeting in the United States. The Trusteeship Committee's subcommittee was still unable to establish a clear definition of the phrase "countries directly related to the mandated territories" yesterday, and the Trusteeship Committee has been delayed for more than a week because of this matter, and it seems that there is still no solution. Canada proposed that when a member state intends to transfer land to trusteeship, it must notify the Secretary-General of its intention and the names of the countries it intends to negotiate with. The latter should inform all member states, and any country that considers itself directly related but is not included in the list may inform the Secretary-General so that it can be forwarded to the original presenting country. This suggestion was deemed too broad and was not accepted by the major trustee powers. Syria still argued that the opinions of countries that are linguistically, socially, culturally, and economically similar to the people of the mandated territories should be sought. The committee, with divergent opinions, decided to leave the entire trusteeship issue for discussion in the second half of the General Assembly.

### Harriman Arrives in Japan, Expected to Stay in Japan for One or Two Days

### U.S. Will Not Disclose Information on Atomic Bomb Test, House Committee Has Passed Bill

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 31st] The U.S. House of Representatives will consider a bill to prohibit the disclosure of information obtained from the upcoming atomic bomb bombing fleet test to foreign countries, so that the future security of the United States will not be threatened. The House Naval Affairs Committee passed the bill yesterday. The bill was submitted to the committee by Vice Admiral Blandy, commander of the Navy's Special Mixed Fleet responsible for directing the test. The original text of the bill is as follows: The Secretaries of the Army and Navy shall take necessary steps to ensure that information relating to the test is not disclosed to foreign governments or people, except where they deem that it would not harm the interests of the United States.

[Reuters, London, 1st] Prime Minister Attlee stated last night in the House of Commons that the British government hopes that the use of atomic energy will be developed in cooperation rather than competition with other countries. According to the British government's opinion, the scale of its research and production work in the United Kingdom should be sufficient to achieve the above-mentioned goal.

### Lord Killearn Arrives in Java to Mediate Dispute Between Indonesia and the Netherlands, Netherlands Expresses Displeasure Over Proposal to Transfer to Trusteeship

[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from London on the 1st, British envoy to Indonesia Lord Killearn arrived in Batavia today. It is reported that the points he stated at the previous press conference were quite different from what was reported in the newspapers. He did not advocate that Indonesia should be placed under a trusteeship system, but only suggested that the country join the United Nations organization. There were continued conflicts in Java today, with many casualties. [Associated Press, London, 31st] Lord Killearn, former British Ambassador to the Soviet Union and now Ambassador to the United States, recently traveled to Java as a special envoy to mediate the East Indies issue. It was learned today that he had made an explosive declaration, stating that it is highly possible that the East Indies will be transferred to the United Nations organization for trusteeship. Dutch circles were mostly incredulous upon hearing the news. A Dutch official told a reporter from the Associated Press that Dutch people in London had not been able to confirm that Killearn had made this statement. Spokespersons for the British Colonial Office and the Foreign Office said that they did not believe that the Netherlands would be willing to abandon the East Indies to the United Nations for trusteeship. U.S. officials also expressed surprise at the news and shared the same observation as the British, seeming to believe that the Netherlands would not be willing to take this action. According to the United Nations Charter, countries can voluntarily transfer their territories to the United Nations organization for trusteeship. If the Netherlands is willing to abandon the East Indies, it will put other colonial countries in a very difficult situation.

The "New York Times" gave a special review, saying that the book "strengthens the arguments of those assertive Democrats in the United States and Chicago who are striving to raise the living standards of the people of the Far East - for the sake of China itself, and also for the opportunity to strengthen world order with another great, peaceful and democratic country among the nations of the world."

### Resignation of the Iraqi Cabinet

[Reuters, Baghdad] Dated: The Iraqi cabinet resigned yesterday. The Iraqi regent immediately went to Transjordan to meet King Abdullah. A new prime minister will likely not be appointed until the regent returns home. Yesterday afternoon, Jews throughout Palestine held a mass rally on the 31st to protest immigration restrictions and land laws.

On the 30th, the U.S. Postmaster General sold the first five-cent Roosevelt commemorative stamp to President Truman at the White House. The stamp features President Roosevelt's name and likeness, the words "Four Freedoms," and a world map on the back.

### Leader of the Siamese Progressive Party, Khuang Aphaiwong, Appointed New Prime Minister; Charged with the Important Task of Establishing Progress

[Reuters, Bangkok, 1st] King Mahidol of Siam yesterday morning appointed Khuang Aphaiwong, the well-respected leader of the Democratic Party, as the new Prime Minister of Siam. Khuang's name was recommended to the King by the Speaker of the House after debate in the National Assembly on Wednesday. The new Prime Minister stated yesterday that he hopes Siam will soon become a member of the United Nations. Regarding the land annexed by Siam from Vietnam in 1941, which caused disputes with France, Siam welcomes assistance from Britain and the United States in resolving the matter. He predicted that a plebiscite held in the disputed area would vote in favor of annexation by Siam. Regarding the Anglo-Siamese Treaty, he anticipated "heated debate" in the National Assembly. Khuang is Siamese, but he comes from Cambodia, one of the four French protectorates of Vietnam, a large part of which has been annexed by Siam. After the overthrow of the dictatorship of former Siamese Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram in August 1944, Khuang succeeded him as Prime Minister for a time, until August of last year. Khuang's appointment follows five days of political turmoil, during which candidates favored by various parties were unwilling to accept the position. The new Prime Minister bears a heavy responsibility, as he must lead the government through what may be the most difficult political crisis Siam has ever faced. The 1932 Siamese "Revolution" resulted only in nominal progress and the abolition of absolute monarchy, but the currently anticipated constitutional changes will finally give Siam genuine democracy. The new government may have to deal with opposition from the parties that have ruled the country for the past thirteen years, and it faces the important task of reorganizing the National Assembly. Originally, half of the representatives in the National Assembly were elected and half were appointed by the King of Siam, but under the new constitution, the National Assembly will be replaced by an elected parliament. Whether the Siamese people are prepared to fully assume the responsibility of electing all members of parliament remains questionable.

Today is the first day of the Lunar New Year.

Today, the team will face the British Navy, as the HMS "Glenearn" has arrived in Shanghai, and it is said that there are many good football players among the crew. To avoid repeating past mistakes, Donghua has carefully considered its lineup. Xue Ning has decided to play, but Zhang Banglun is unavailable due to personal matters. Liu Xianhan will take his place. In addition, left midfielder Song Lingsheng is still out of town, and if he is unable to make it, Han Longbo will take his place. In any case, Donghua is being extremely cautious in today's match against the British Navy, whose strength is unknown. Today's schedule is listed below:

### Temporary Representatives of Electricity Workers Guarantee No More Work Stoppages; Arrested Workers Released on Bail; Wu Shen Hopes for Compliance with the Law

[Our Newspaper] The labor strike at the electricity company took a sudden turn the day before yesterday, and yesterday it took another sharp turn downward. Yesterday, from early morning, the labor strike at the electricity company gradually progressed. The main developments:

Beginning of Negotiations

(1) At approximately 11 AM, more than 2,000 workers gathered at the Social Bureau on Madang Road to collectively submit a petition, demanding the release of the 19 arrested members of the labor union's board of directors and supervisors. (2) At 12 PM, Director Li Jianhua and Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan of the Social Bureau began negotiations with the temporary representatives of the workers. The workers demanded: (a) the immediate release of the arrested worker representatives; (b) the immediate investigation of those disturbing order; (c) the immediate request for the management to resolve the conditions with a reasonable attitude. (3) At approximately 4 PM, all the "three-shift" workers (i.e., the workers maintaining electricity generation) at the electricity company left the factory and went to the Social Bureau to join the petitioning group. (4) At approximately 8 PM, negotiations took a turn for the better. Director Li Jianhua of the Social Bureau reported to all the workers that the government, in consideration of the welfare of the citizens and to avoid a "powerless New Year," and to promote harmony between labor and management, was prepared to consider the request to release the arrested workers.

Workers' Guarantee

(5) After Director Li Jianhua's report, the workers elected 10 temporary representatives to negotiate the release conditions as follows: 1. Guarantee immediate resumption of work by all workers, and workers on duty in the machinery room during the holiday period (February 2 to 5) will go to the factory as usual and will not be obstructed; 2. After the Spring Festival holiday, the government will continue to convene mediation; 3. Guarantee that workers will abide by government laws and regulations, and will not engage in any further work stoppages or strikes during the mediation or arbitration period. The signatories on February 1 were: Li Sheng and Qiu Zaiyao from the Nanjing Road representatives, Zhang Mincai and Yan Shaoling from Yangshupu representatives, Tang Lansheng and Wang Enpeng, Zhang Shiting and Yu Jiqing, Qi Denggao and Ding Buyun from Feilun Road representatives. (6) The temporary representatives sought the opinions of all the workers and read out the conditions for approval. All the workers passed it. (7) At 9:30 PM, Director Li Jianhua, Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan, and Section Chief Zhou Shangyi of the Social Bureau went to the Xuehuali Road Local Procuratorate to handle the bail procedures with the temporary representatives. (8) At 11:30 PM, all 19 arrested representatives were released on bail and, together with the temporary representatives, were taken to the Social Bureau by the police in a black bus.

Wu Kaixian Speaks

Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Bureau stated in his speech: "The labor strike at the electricity company was illegal because the workers did not follow the procedures of the Labor Dispute Resolution Act and went on strike without authorization. I sympathize with the workers' hardships and have tried my best to mediate. Unfortunately, the workers did not accept the advice and delayed for many days, and the dispute of yesterday occurred, which is regrettable. Today, the workers petitioned for the release of the arrested representatives. According to the law, the executive branch has no right to interfere with the judiciary. However, I sympathize with the workers' pain and, after consulting with the mayor, decided to assist the petitioning workers to bail out from the court in order to resolve the matter. I hope that in the future, the workers must abide by the legal framework so that labor-management disputes can be resolved in accordance with legal procedures, especially public utilities, which are of great importance to the welfare of the entire city. Workers should not arbitrarily engage in work stoppages or strikes. If the workers have reasonable demands, the government will do its best to assist them in resolving them, but they must not exceed the scope of the law, so that the government cannot assist them."

### Gold Shops Energetic - Gold Prices Reach New Highs - US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Also Rise

Yesterday was New Year's Eve, and most businesses were closed. Only gold shops remained open due to time constraints, attracting a large number of customers. The market opened at 1,155,000 [yuan per tael], and driven by the enthusiastic buying from gold shops and small money changers, prices quickly surged to a new high of around 2,130,000. A large bank sold aggressively at the high, pushing the price down to 1,170,000 at one point. However, by noon, prices had recovered to 1,210,000, a further increase of 70,000 compared to the previous close. Trading then ceased, with even scattered transactions disappearing.

### New People and New Ideas

‚Äî Zhang Chengjun

Mr. Willkie of the United States, after traveling along the Al-Alamien line in North Africa, planted a belief in his heart: "Brilliant victories on the battlefield are not enough to win this war that extends to every corner of the world; only new people and new ideas dominating the institutions of our relations with Eastern nations can achieve complete victory and prevent peace from becoming just another truce." (See page 13 of Liu Zunqi's translation). This is such a great and rational belief. When we see the turbulent situation in the world after today's peace, we feel even more the wisdom of Willkie's foresight. The surging tide of Eastern national movements today cannot be resolved by the Western imperialist use of force and high-pressure tactics. Only new people and new ideas can resolve these disturbances and share the fruits of victory earned by millions of lives. For the sake of the future of countries like France and the Netherlands, for the sake of lasting world peace, the only way is to change course completely and radically change their policies towards colonies around the world; especially towards Eastern nations. Because the Eastern nations have awakened in this war, and the success of the Chinese Revolution and the victory of the War of Resistance have provided a bright indicator for other Eastern nations. They will move towards this indicator, they will learn from China's decades of experience in national revolution and its eight years of heroic deeds against aggression and imperialism. And most of the people in China sympathize with their movement. For a hundred years, China has suffered from the aggression of imperialism - especially Japanese imperialism - in the political, economic, and military fields. Even now, a gentle touch still evokes lingering pain. Therefore, the belief in national self-determination and liberation has been deeply rooted in the minds of every person in the entire Eastern nation. Now that a good opportunity has arrived, how can they give it up?

Truth will not be extinguished, and the new era requires new people and new ideas to handle it. May we all deeply appreciate Mr. Willkie's warning, and may we all learn from all that is new.

### Congratulations on Invention

‚Äî Rong Huilan

On this Lunar New Year's Day, when the old calendar is nominally abolished but still exists, relatives and friends, not to mention those we meet and know but do not know your esteemed name, must greet each other with clasped hands, mutually saying, "Congratulations on getting rich, everyone get rich." Listen, it's all "Congratulations on getting rich, everyone get rich." A sound of getting rich everywhere. Get rich every year, get rich every year, it can be called getting rich forever. You get rich, I get rich, it's truly getting rich first.

Unfortunately, these eight words, "Congratulations on getting rich, everyone get rich," are not the six-character mantra of the monk Ji Dian, saying them is like saying nothing, and getting rich remains a problem.

I don't know if the New Year greetings in other countries are also "Congratulations on getting rich, everyone get rich!" However, it is said that Westerners greet the New Year with "Wishing you happiness and peace this year," "Progress and success," "Something created." It seems that no one says "Congratulations on getting rich" or "Everyone get rich."

It's strange that we shout loudly to get rich, think about getting rich all the time, but as the late Premier Sun said, "China is nothing more than the great poor and the small poor," while others don't shout "Congratulations on getting rich" or "Everyone get rich," but how can they be so rich and especially rich? The reason is also very simple. It's because we are only saying and thinking, not doing, while others are also saying, also thinking, and even more doing.

Please see, after the peace, in just five months, hasn't the United States invented many new things? But as for us, we are still the same as before.

If foreigners were to hear us constantly congratulating each other on getting rich, they might say we are crazy from poverty.

Instead of everyone focusing on getting rich like this, it's better to change our style and strive to invent. Let's compete with foreigners in creation, not letting them have a monopoly on being first. Everyone, when you meet, clasp your hands and say to each other "Congratulations on invention!" (End of Reward)

### Year-End Stove Shutdown

‚Äî Chen Jinggu

Shanghai is a place where there are more people than there are jobs, more people than there are markets.

The streets are crowded with people coming and going, and people are darting in and out of the alleyways. In general, Shanghai is full of people, all coming from all directions; some people have money, not enough stimulation and enjoyment in the interior, so they come to Shanghai to find stimulation and talk about enjoyment; some people have heard that Shanghai is full of gold, so they come to Shanghai to pan for gold.

In this way, the streets are becoming more and more crowded with people.

Statistics show that among so many people, there are still many who stay with relatives and friends, setting up a temporary bed, and eating alleyway food three times a day at the entrance of the alleyway. It cannot be said that they must be coming to pan for gold; there are even more who are just looking for a small job to make a living! In large stores, wireless radios broadcast melodious songs; neon lights emit dazzling advertisements. After all, Shanghai is still Shanghai, and those without clothes or food still have to struggle to live, waiting for a glimmer of hope.

Christmas has passed, New Year's has passed, and they have all passed silently, of course, they cannot be compared with the general rich and young masters, who say they buy brandy and turkey to celebrate the holiday, but they always pass silently at the entrance of the alleyway. But next comes the Lunar New Year, and many small restaurants in the alleyways have posted red strips of paper: "Year-end stove shutdown, temporarily closed."

People with money will not pay attention to this strip; people with status and power, people with houses and cooks will not pay attention to this kind of strip. However, people who eat alleyway food look at it, in the cold weather of December, it is like pouring a basin of cold water:

"Once the Lunar New Year comes, the alleyway restaurants shut down their stoves, what to do?"

Indeed, the social authorities pay attention to the resolution of labor-capital disputes, but they have not taken into account such a social problem that is neither too big nor too small.

### Lianghu Rice Cake Ningbo

‚Äî Duyun

"Year after year higher, section after section higher, earn ingots all year round." At the end of the Lunar New Year, every household must prepare some rice cakes. Whether fried or stir-fried, it is even better to have a bowl of rice cake soup. In Shanghai, there are rice cake shops that open in season, but they can only be bought and eaten immediately, they cannot be stored for a long time. In my hometown of Ningbo, rice cakes are a year-round food. Farmers use them as snacks, and during the busy farming season, they are the only filling food. Therefore, they must be stored for a long time without spoiling, and Lianghu rice cakes have the above conditions, so they are very famous.

Lianghu is a town in Shangyu County, formerly under the jurisdiction of Shaoxing. The area produces a type of Lianghu rice, which is softer than late rice and harder than glutinous rice. First, soak the rice for twenty days, then drain it, or dry grind it, or water grind it, striving for fineness. Steam it with firewood, ensuring it is thoroughly cooked. Place it in a stone mortar and pound it by hand, then take it out. Knead it vigorously with both hands until it is sticky. This kind of rice cake is delicious and can be stored for a long time without spoiling. The ordinary rice used in Shanghai rice cakes is Du rice, and both the workmanship and materials are insufficient. If immersed in water for three to five days, it will rot. It cannot be compared with Lianghu rice cakes. Shaoxing and Ningbo also use Lianghu rice varieties, so the rice cakes made are also called Lianghu rice cakes.

There is also a type of rice cake called Mihuai, which is only available in Ningbo. First, use pure glutinous rice (without any non-glutinous grains) and rub it white. "One dou of coarse rice should be discounted by 20%." Immerse it in water for half a day, take it out and drain it, then steam it in a steamer until cooked, turning it into glutinous rice. Place it in a stone mortar and pound it hard by young, strong men. One person lifts the stone pestle to pound, and one person turns the cooked rice ball inside the mortar, together with each fall, pounding until exhausted, then switch shifts to pound again. This takes several tens of minutes, turning it into a glutinous rice ball. Take it out of the mortar, pick it into Huai balls, and let men and women work together, placing it in the palm of the hand and patting it into a pancake shape. To prevent stickiness, you can put some flour in the palm of your hand. Pat them evenly in size and smooth, then place them one by one on a board and wait for them to cool completely before immersing them in water. To eat, take them out, sweeten them with fine sand sugar and stew them, or savory, use them to make soup with rice cakes, the taste is wonderful. There are also Ningbo Huai sold in Shanghai, but the glutinous rice is not pure, and the pounding is not enough, it is not as delicious as the local Ningbo ones.

### Unleash Abundant Energy

‚Äî Wu Zijia

Everyone is endowed with unlimited vital life force, which can be used for work and career. Generally speaking, a successful person must be able to fully utilize his energy. This energy has become an indispensable factor for work. Our energy is never spent in vain, its reward is the success of work and career, and the size of our success depends entirely on how much energy we use.

Many people are indeed limited by physical strength and cannot maximize their intelligence. Indeed, physical strength is a key element to work and career success. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body, and people with unhealthy bodies will inevitably feel mentally sluggish. Even if they want to work hard to develop their careers, they sometimes feel that their heart is willing but their strength is not enough.

However, there are many people in society who do not fail to maximize their intelligence entirely because of insufficient physical strength. There is a considerable reason for being physically weak and unable to use all of one's energy, but the fact is that there are many people who are physically strong but are unwilling to do their best to make their work excellent and reach the pinnacle of success. This is because these people abandon themselves to despair, decline and sink, or are inherently self-deprecating.

American educator Edward Thorndike studied 270 football players. According to the test results he published in 1940, the players competing on the sports field, even though they had exhausted their energy, still had at least 30% that had not fully unleashed their energy. Colin, a famous American electrical engineer, once said to his students, "We have endless energy stored in our bodies, and we have not been able to fully unleash it. At most, we only use a portion of it, which is very regrettable." From this, we can see that we all have very sufficient energy, but we use very little of it in work and career, so we must work harder and move forward toward the future.

The Greek philosopher Socrates said, "Know thyself." Yes, we must have self-awareness, and we must not be stingy with our energy. Within the limits of not affecting health, we must never abandon ourselves to despair, thinking that our achievements are only this point, and nothing more can be done. The reason why there are so few successful people in society, and why successful people cannot achieve greater success, is none other than this. How do we know that we have used all of our energy? How do we know that we cannot achieve greater success in work and career?

If everyone could make full use of his energy, then this world would become more perfect. As for how to unleash our abundant energy? First, we must stimulate the will to move forward, increase enthusiasm for work, take "sense of career" as a prerequisite, not be afraid of difficulties, and never give up until the purpose of success is achieved in doing anything, and never give up until we do it perfectly. Second, we must have appropriate exercise, regulate the tired body and mind, increase healthy physique, and then we will be interested and courageous in doing things. Third, we must have an optimistic attitude, feel that life is lovely and that life is meaningful, so naturally we are willing to dedicate our entire mind and strength to the crowd, to work for others, and to serve society. Being able to do more things and contribute more effort is very pleasant and satisfying. Fourth, we must make appropriate use of time, cultivate legitimate entertainment, eliminate habits that are harmful to the body and mind, and not be willing to waste time, which is not willing to waste energy.

From today onwards, let us all cheer up and make good use of our abundant energy for ourselves, and even more for society!

### Using Radar to Map the Moon

‚Äî Yu Songyao

Someday, all the mountains on the moon can be mapped with "radar." This is what the famous British physicist Sir Edward Appleton said. Sir Appleton has proven that the Earth's surface is surrounded by layers of charged air. His theory is that radio waves emitted by shortwave transmitters are reflected back when they encounter the surface of the moon. This echo can be used to map the moon's terrain.

Personnel at the US Institute of Radiology are still skeptical about this. They say: The theory is correct, but the super-powered motors required to complete this task are difficult to construct. Until this machinery is perfectly made, it seems that materials about the moon will still have to be collected by telescope photography. (Editor's Note: It was reported a few days ago that radar has been transmitted to the moon. This may be the starting point for mapping the moon.)

Every evening, the representatives of the PCC were invited to report in turn, and people from all walks of life freely expressed their opinions, the situation was very enthusiastic. The first general meeting was held at 7 pm on the 12th of this month in the Yu Cooperation Auditorium.

Democracy and unity, step forward in unison, respect the common people, never beat the people. We are the people's army, we are the heart of benevolence, establish a democratic government, and be free people forever!
