It is also reported that Chairman Chiang may return to the capital as early as the 28th after returning from Chengdu to Chongqing, and the Secretary-General of the National Government is preparing to accompany him to Nanjing.

### Progress in Peace Negotiations; New Ceasefire Agreement in Northeast Expected; Marshall Changes Schedule to Arrive in Nanjing Early Next Week

[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, dated 26th] Chongqing News: After the date of Special Envoy Marshall's trip was decided, the political situation, which had been turbulent for more than seven months, took a sharp turn for the better with the capital relocation climax. It is reported that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Democratic League have decided to send people to Nanjing to find housing. The CCP's office in Hongyan Village, Chongqing, is preparing to close. The US side has indicated that it will provide the most favorable transportation to assist in the relocation. It is reported that the Youth Party has found office space in Nanjing, and the government will provide convenience for all opposition parties to reside here. The situation may improve due to the relocation. Tonight, a certain National Assembly occupational representative jokingly told reporters that discussing politics in Nanjing or Lushan can broaden horizons, relax the mind, and enhance hearing, because the groans and wails of the small people suffering from the hardship of victory are especially poignant when heard coming from the southeast of the US.

[United Press, Chongqing, dated 26th] Well-informed observers believe today that a new agreement to halt the civil war in Northeast China is possible to be established by the weekend. Since returning from the United States, Special Envoy Marshall has been consulting with government officials and key KMT-CCP personnel, and has now postponed his trip to Nanjing until early next week. This has led to speculation that important developments may be imminent. Although no formal announcement has been made regarding the progress of the negotiations to date, Gillon is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 27th.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, dated 26th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife were invited to Lin Yuan for lunch with Chairman Chiang before his departure from Chongqing to Chengdu on the 25th at noon. On the morning of the 26th, the Marshalls returned to Chongqing from the Shantung. No meetings were scheduled on Mr. Marshall's guest reception schedule today. The Marshalls may leave Chongqing and fly to Nanjing on the 29th.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, dated 26th] Yishi Bao reported today that Special Envoy Marshall told the leaders of the Democratic League: "If the CCP can clearly state its demands and propose a political solution, the war in the Northeast can be stopped within 24 hours." This news has not been confirmed by Marshall's headquarters.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, dated 26th] CCP's Zhou Enlai reiterated tonight that the party regards "unconditional ceasefire" as the price for discussing the Northeast issue. Government spokesperson Wu Guozhen refuted Zhou's ceasefire method, saying: "An unconditional ceasefire in the Northeast would be tantamount to admitting that the CCP's violation of the January 10th ceasefire order was a legitimate act." Although the opinions of the KMT and the CCP are vastly different, Special Envoy Marshall has decided to stay in the temporary capital for at least two more days, hoping that both sides can reach a compromise solution. However, the Marshalls will remain in the temporary capital until at least next Monday. Chairman Chiang has now gone to Chengdu for a pre-departure tour and is scheduled to return to the temporary capital next Monday. If resolved according to Zhou Enlai's method, the CCP will control most of the Northeast, including Changchun and Harbin, which Zhou also believes to be true. Zhou also said: "Once the war in the Northeast ceases, we are willing to discuss the economic and political issues of the Northeast. We do not want to discuss the situation in the Northeast until the war ceases. When I exchanged opinions with General Marshall, I explained this point of view to Mr. Marshall. I am ready to sign a new ceasefire agreement based on an unconditional ceasefire today. I hope that once the war ceases, I will personally go to the Northeast with members of the military three-person group or others to investigate, and at that time I will inspect the CCP's Northeast Command and other cities in the Northeast. If the government provides transportation and housing, and negotiations are resumed, we can move our office to Nanjing at the beginning of next month. We are now willing to continue negotiating general issues such as government reorganization, but the government has no representatives staying in Chongqing to meet with us." The military reorganization agreement stipulates that five Nationalist armies and one Communist army should be stationed in the Northeast. It is reported that Zhou has requested to amend this agreement, but Zhou denied this, only saying: "Since the agreement was signed, the situation in the Northeast has changed greatly." At the same time, both the KMT and the CCP stated today that there is no new information regarding the war in the Siping Street area and the situation in Harbin.

### National Army Enters Siping Street Station; Advancing Circumferentially Along the Railway; No Communist Troops East of Bamiancheng and Dawa Street

[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Office, dated 26th] The situation in the Northeast will have a brand new development in the next one or two weeks. Sources concerned said that the continuous movement of Nationalist troops from South China to the north and Du Yuming's return to Shenyang to command will greatly improve the position of Nationalist troops in the Northeast and strengthen their takeover power. Military sources say that the Nationalist army has officially entered Siping Street Station, but transportation sources say that trains departing from Shenyang still terminate at Shuangmiaoxi Station, 20 kilometers from Siping Street. Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo is also commanding there. Recent rumors in Shenyang and Beiping that the Nationalist army has reached the vicinity of Gongzhuling are premature. From the current battle situation, it appears that the Nationalist army is advancing circumferentially along the railway line on both sides. The vicinity of Gongzhuling is mountainous, and there will be a fierce battle there in the future.

[United Press, Beiping, dated 26th] According to military sources in Shenyang, the Communist army is still holding Gongzhuling. Some units of the New 1st Army have made some progress using roundabout tactics, but the main battles are still taking place south of the area. Nationalist army sources here revealed that telegraphic communications between Beiping and Shenyang and Harbin and Qiqihar have been completely cut off. This also shows that the Soviet army has withdrawn from the two cities and the Communists have occupied them.

[United Press, Chongqing, dated 26th] News from Shenyang was reported, stating that the Nationalist army crossed Siping Street and, after fierce fighting, reached Ershijiazhai (transliteration) and other strongholds east of Gongzhuling.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, dated 26th] Military news: When the takeover troops advanced to the vicinity of Yahu Battery south of Siping Street, they were attacked by the Communist army. After a fierce battle, the Communist army collapsed. More than 30 Communist soldiers were captured, including Japanese commanders Kazama Yukio and Miura Yuji. Kazama Yukio confessed that he was the machine gun squad leader of the 3rd Platoon, 3rd Company, 1st Regiment of the 14th Brigade of the Communist army. Miura Yuji confessed that he was the machine gun squad leader of the 7th Company, 66th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the Communist army. He also said that each division and brigade of the Communist army in Siping Street has about 100 Japanese soldiers mixed in.

[Also a dispatch] Military news: Our Nationalist takeover troops entered Bamiancheng at 10:30 AM on the 22nd of this month. There are currently no Communist troops in the vicinity east of Bamiancheng to Dawa Street. [United Press, Hong Kong, dated 26th] It was revealed here this morning that four US Navy tank landing craft, carrying 4,000 officers and soldiers of the Chinese 93rd Army, left Kowloon yesterday for the Northeast.

### Relocation of Industrial Equipment from Northeast China: US Receives Soviet Reply, State Department Announces Ongoing Review

[Washington, D.C., US News Agency, 25th] The State Department announced today: The Soviet reply to the second US note of February 9th, requesting a report regarding China's accusation that Soviet troops removed wartime spoils from Northeast China, has been received and is currently under review by the State Department. The Soviet reply was transmitted through the US Embassy in Moscow.

[Washington, D.C., United Press, 25th] According to unofficial but reliable sources: The US government considers the Soviet reply to the US regarding the relocation of industrial equipment from the Nine Eastern Provinces of China to be unsatisfactory. The Soviet reply was in response to the US inquiry in March and, in the view of some authorities in Washington, is tantamount to rejecting the US protest. The Northeast issue is crucial to the future of peace in Asia. The US has, in effect, accused the Soviet Union of removing all industrial equipment during its occupation of the Nine Eastern Provinces. The US, in its note to the Soviet Union in February, objected to the Soviet action, believing it to be inconsistent with the principle of the United Nations jointly handling territories and assets that belong to China and should be decided upon jointly by the United Nations, not unilaterally by one country. The Soviet Union issued a reply in early March, refuting the claim, stating that the Soviet army regarded Japanese industries in the Nine Eastern Provinces that had supplied the Japanese military as "war spoils" and that their removal was not inappropriate.

[Washington, D.C., United Press, 26th] Regarding the Soviet Union's possession of Japanese assets in the Nine Eastern Provinces, the Soviet Union has submitted a new note in response to the US. However, US officials feel dissatisfied and plan to re-examine the issue. According to diplomatic sources, US Secretary of State Byrnes is currently in Paris and may discuss the matter informally with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Officials here have clarified the US policy towards the Nine Eastern Provinces, which is twofold: (1) To find a way for the United Nations to agree on how to dispose of Japanese assets, and (2) To establish long-term economic policies based on Chinese administration of the Nine Eastern Provinces, to avoid bilateral agreements between China and the Soviet Union that would not give the US opportunities for investment and trade.

US Sends Pauley to Northeast China to Investigate Soviet Removal Quantities

[Washington, D.C., United Press, 25th] Regarding the Soviet Union's relocation of industrial equipment from the Nine Eastern Provinces of China, the Soviet Union today submitted a reply to the US inquiry. Sources familiar with the content say that its wording reaffirms the Soviet Union's past policy of regarding the industrial equipment as war spoils, and it advocates for joint Sino-Soviet management. US officials greatly fear that the Soviet Union will ultimately succeed in its insistence on these two points. If so, American commercial and political influence will not be able to reach the vast area of ​​Northeast China. To partially address this issue, President Truman has sent reparations commissioner Pauley to Northeast China to investigate how much industrial equipment has been removed by the Soviets. The US government believes that such an investigation is necessary to determine the Japanese reparations policy.

[Washington, D.C., United Press, 25th] The State Department has announced that Japanese assets inside and outside Japan will be used as reparations to compensate countries participating in the Pacific War. The State Department will establish a United Nations reparations agency to manage this. All movements of Japanese industrial equipment as reparations to various governments must be approved by the agency. Government requests for reparations should be based on wartime losses. Previously, there were requests for US representative to the Far Eastern Commission, McCoy, to make public the content of the US proposal to establish a reparations agency within the framework of the Commission. Secretary of State Byrnes issued notes to China and the Soviet Union on February 9, declaring opposition to any country of the United Nations unilaterally making final disposition of Japanese assets in Asia, and declaring that the US was prepared to make recommendations on reparations policy for consideration by the United Nations in the Pacific. He also stated that the US would sell industrial equipment and other assets received from Japanese reparations, but the US would not take any action to receive and distribute Japanese assets as part of reparations until all United Nations agreed to this policy.

### Guiding Idle Capital into the Right Track: The Government Resolves to Suppress Speculation, Yu Hongjun Talks About Finance and Economy to Reporters

[Report from this newspaper] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun received reporters from various newspapers at his office in the Jianghai Customs yesterday afternoon, and kindly answered the questions raised. The main points are recorded as follows: Mr. Yu said that the most important task for finance and economy at present is how to guide idle capital and channel it into production. Since the government opened the foreign exchange market and sold gold, the gold and exchange markets have stabilized. The government now holds abundant foreign exchange and gold, and is determined to strike at speculators so that they cannot use their manipulative tricks. Strengthening the organization of exchanges is also a major way to guide idle capital into the right track. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai this time, he is listening to opinions from all relevant parties and is carefully discussing the resumption of exchanges. It is believed that the resumption of various exchanges is imminent. Regarding the government's various tax revenues, Mr. Yu believes that the principle is to avoid hindering production and the development of the national economy. In recent months, the income from customs, salt, and unified taxes has increased significantly. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee passed the introduction of new taxes such as property tax, exchange tax, transaction tax, and comprehensive income tax; preparations are now actively underway, and the tax rates for each item are not very high. As for the registration of puppet currency, the deadline has been set for the end of April. After the deadline, the handling methods will be determined based on the amount and nature of registration in various places, ultimately aiming to benefit the general public and prevent speculation by unscrupulous people. Finally, regarding the request of customs employees yesterday to adjust their salaries, Mr. Yu said: The Commissioner of Customs, Li Du, Deputy Commissioner of Customs, Ding Guitang, and Director of Customs Administration, Zhang Fuyun, have requested instructions for this matter. He firmly stated that the government had already decided that the treatment of customs employees should be the same as that of civil servants. Therefore, he personally instructed and urged all colleagues to temporarily endure the difficulties and work with peace of mind. Mr. Yu earnestly stated to the reporters that the current period is a time for working hard, and he does not want to make many speeches. However, since the reporters have shown such enthusiasm in asking questions, he must answer to the best of his knowledge to satisfy the enthusiasm of the news media. It is heard that Mr. Yu will not stay in Shanghai for a long time and will return to the capital within a day or two for official business.

[Shanghai, Central News Agency] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and will return to the capital within two days to preside over the relocation of the Ministry of Finance. The main task of Mr. Yu's trip to Shanghai is to inspect the various institutions under the Ministry of Finance, and to conduct on-site investigations into the situation of various exchanges in the city, consult with the financial community on resumption methods, and discuss effective measures with local authorities to crack down on speculation, attract foreign capital, and guide it into production, in order to stabilize the city's finances, increase production, and naturally lower prices. In the morning, Mr. Yu visited President Song of the Central Bank, and at 9 o'clock, he went to the Jianghai Customs for inspection. He then returned to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance and met with Li Du, Commissioner of Customs, Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs, and Zhang Fuyun, Director of Customs Administration, to listen to their reports. According to Mr. Yu's statement to reporters, customs revenue is increasing daily. As of the 20th of this month, more than one trillion yuan in customs duties have been collected, exceeding the total revenue for the entire previous month by more than one-tenth. At 10:30 am, Mr. Blandford, an American consultant to the Ministry of Finance, visited Mr. Yu to provide a detailed analysis of the content of the national budget and discussed the general financial situation of China. The discussion lasted for an hour and a half. Afterwards, Mr. Yu also met with Wei Xianzhang, Director of the Central Mint, and gave instructions.

[Nanjing, This Newspaper, 26th] Lin Hu, a representative from Guangxi, told this newspaper's reporter that seventy-three of Guangxi Province's ninety-nine counties had been occupied by the enemy. The people, after surviving the war, are now suffering from disasters. More than ten million disaster victims throughout the province are starving. The situation is so tragic that it is beyond description. The most severely affected areas at present are He County and Lipu County, which are in urgent need of relief. Xia Dingwen, a representative from Jiangsu, who recently arrived in Nanjing via Qingdao from Donghai, said that some of the communist troops in Northern Jiangsu have moved north. The people flee wherever the troops go, and the villages become ruins. There are no signs of human life for dozens of miles. The Xuzhou-Lianyungang section of the Longhai Railway, although repaired after being destroyed by the communist troops on January 14, has not yet been opened to traffic. Currently, the area twenty miles west of Donghai and thirty miles east of Tongshan are controlled by the communist troops. The communist troops are carrying out the so-called "cruel struggle" in their occupied areas, causing more than 30,000 refugees to flee to Donghai.

### Shanghai National Assembly Representatives Met Yesterday, Deciding to Go to Nanjing Before May 2nd, and Telegraphing Representatives Elsewhere to Report on Time

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Branch of the National Assembly Fraternity Association held its eleventh meeting at the association's headquarters in the Pudong Building. They expressed concerns about the postponement of the National Assembly. The representatives who attended were Xi Yushu, Zhou Xuexiang, Chen Guanying, Cheng Zhonghang, Zhu Xuefan, Pang Shusen, He Yuanming, Ye Yunhui, Ding Zhongying, Niu Jingting, Ye Xianggao, Chen Chuxiang, Hu Shuqian, Wang Qizhang, Chen Chaoxiu, Tang Qi, Li Shengbo, and over twenty others. The meeting was chaired by Xi Yushu, who reported that after the government formally announced the convening of the National Assembly, it suddenly announced a postponement. Although the government has its own difficulties, the representatives have a heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the voters, and they cannot remain silent. Moreover, many representatives from various places are already on their way to Nanjing, and it is better to continue to move forward and gather in the capital to concentrate their efforts to seek advocacy. The discussion then began, and the above opinions were used to draft a telegram, which read: "To all newspaper offices across the country and to the National Assembly Fraternity Associations of all provinces and cities: The central government has expressly postponed the National Assembly. We firmly believe that it will be held soon. We hereby telegram to all National Assembly representatives en route across the country, please continue to move forward and gather in the capital before May 4. During the period of postponement, we can exchange views with each other on the draft constitution and important issues in Nanjing and make suggestions. We hope you will take this into consideration. Shanghai Branch of the National Assembly Fraternity Association." It was also decided that the representatives in Shanghai should gather and report in Nanjing before May 2. After the meeting, Xi Yushu told reporters that when he was inland, he had tried his best to advocate the speedy convening of the National Assembly. Unexpectedly, due to various reasons, the opening date has been postponed again and again, which is deeply regrettable. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau originally planned to add special carriages for the convenience of the National Assembly representatives to Nanjing, but after learning of the postponement of the meeting yesterday, this measure was also shelved. Now that the representatives still intend to go early, transportation is quite inconvenient. Most of the Shanghai representatives are busy with the municipal councilor election, so they will have to wait until after the 29th before they can go to Nanjing. Xi Yushu received an urgent telegram from Nanjing yesterday, but he has postponed his departure due to the election.

### Wu Tiecheng Arrives in Nanjing, Talks About Feelings on Returning to the Capital

[Nanjing, Central News Agency, 26th] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, after flying from Chongqing to Nanjing on the 26th, expressed his feelings about leaving Chongqing and returning to the capital. Mr. Wu first stated that the victory of the War of Resistance and the government's return to the capital were the most meaningful "major events" in the history of our country. The people of the whole country should also be happy and encouraged, and deeply grateful that our rivers and mountains are safe. However, during the period of national construction in the future, we should still uphold the spirit of hard work and endurance of soldiers shedding blood and people sweating during the war, reorganize the old rivers and mountains, and build a new China. The government of our party is seeking peaceful unification, unity, and returning power to the people, and the determination to implement constitutional government is completely the same as the urgent desire of the people. Mr. Wu then talked about the National Assembly issue, saying that the various parties have been slow to submit the list of representatives, which has led to the postponement of the assembly and affected the government's credibility. However, the government, in order to accept the opinions of the public, has expressly ordered a postponement of the convening, and this measure is enough to show that the government tolerates and compromises on all issues that are conducive to peaceful unification and unity. At present, government representatives are preparing to continue consultations with all parties. Wu also quoted a Western proverb, "Good Things Come Last," hoping that future consultations will be conducted smoothly. Wu continued to describe his feelings about leaving Chongqing. He had lived in Chongqing for eight years during the war. When he left this morning, he witnessed the beautiful scenery of the Jialing River and the mountains and forests, and remembered the friendship of the people of Chongqing, and could not help but miss it. Finally, when reporters asked about the postponement of the National Assembly and other issues, Wu replied that the National Assembly would be convened after satisfactory results had been obtained from consultations with all parties. He stated that the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee would be held in the capital starting next week. Wu also said that the delegations of various parties will soon return to Nanjing from Chongqing, and the government has prepared housing and transportation for them.

Four Pig Merchants Murdered by Bandits

According to a report from Wuxing, a boat from Yixing was moored at Niudian Bridge outside the West Gate of the county. The boat owners, Zhong Abing, Shen Songyuan, Lü Genli, and Zong Longzhi, were selling piglets there. Local residents exchanged rice for the piglets, totaling more than sixty dan (a unit of dry volume equal to one hectoliter). Unfortunately, bandits noticed this and gathered six or seven others, murdering the four boat owners by drowning. Recently, corpses began floating to the surface. The county authorities, upon receiving the report, ordered the detective team to conduct a secret investigation and intensify efforts to solve the case. It was learned that the bandits had hidden in Linghu. Detectives rushed to Linghu and found that Cui Xiaoting from Hengtang was the main culprit in the case, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. His father, Cui Agan, was detained for questioning, and miscellaneous rice bags, tools used on the pig boat, and pig food buckets were found in his home, along with three piglets. The father of the victims identified them as belonging to the boat. It was also discovered that the stolen rice, more than sixty dan, had been loaded onto a boat and transported to Hangzhou for sale. There are reportedly more accomplices in the case who are still at large. A strict search is underway to bring them to justice.

Editorial

### The Convening of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference

The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was convened in Paris on the 25th. The convening of this conference is a continuation of the "unfinished business" of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London last month. The previous Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London ended without agreement on the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, and was handed over to the Deputy Ministers Conference to reach an agreement and draft treaties. However, in the past three months, the Deputy Ministers Conference has worked hard but has not made progress, and the deadline of May 1 for the convening of the peace conference in Paris is fast approaching. On the 4th of this month, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes informed the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union of his regret over the slow progress of the Deputy Ministers Conference and proposed that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers should meet in Paris on April 25 to decide on the convening of the peace conference on May 1. The United Kingdom and France first expressed their agreement, and the Soviet Union subsequently agreed. Therefore, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was able to be convened in Paris on April 25 as scheduled. The Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are now happily gathered together. The convening of this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is to discuss the drafting of the peace treaties and the preparation for the peace conference. If an agreement can be reached, it will be extremely important for the future of Europe. Whether the peace conference scheduled to be held in Paris on May 1 can be convened as scheduled depends on the outcome of this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. If this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference can reach an agreement on the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, then the peace conference on May 1 should not be difficult to convene as scheduled; the problem lies in whether an agreement can be reached.

The main issue of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, as is well known, is to find an agreement on the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Originally, the peace treaty with Finland was drafted by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were drafted by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and the peace treaty with Italy was drafted by the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, so far, the peace treaty with Finland has only been discussed separately by the Soviet Union and Finland, and the United Kingdom has never participated. No agreement has been reached on the peace treaties with Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria either. The most difficult issue is the drafting of the peace treaty with Italy, where the positions of the various parties are very far apart. Because the distance between them is so great, there is doubt as to whether this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference can reach an agreement on the peace treaty with Italy. London does not have too much optimism about the convening of this Foreign Ministers Conference, and the views in Washington are somewhat the same. If this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference cannot reach an agreement on the peace treaty with Italy, then the convening of the peace conference on May 1 will inevitably be postponed. The convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference at present is only an attempt to break the deadlock, and breaking this deadlock is indeed very difficult.

The main reason why the peace treaty with Italy has so many difficulties is still the division of territory. Before the war, the Italian "Empire" controlled the Dodecanese Islands in the eastern Mediterranean, Libya in North Africa, and Somaliland and Eritrea in East Africa. Now that Italy has been defeated and surrendered, how should these places be disposed of? The Dodecanese Islands are located in the eastern Mediterranean, and their bases are of great strategic value, enough to control the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East. The Soviet Union advocated handing them over to Greece for safekeeping, originally wanting to use Greece to expand the Soviet Union's influence in the Near East. This obviously conflicts with the interests of the United Kingdom, and the United States also does not want to see the expansion of Soviet influence, which would be enough to control the eastern Mediterranean. This is one reason why the peace treaty with Italy is difficult to agree on. Regarding North Africa and Italian East Africa, the Soviet Union wants to obtain sole trusteeship. If this is approved, the Soviet Union's influence will extend to the central Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, and the Suez Canal, which is the lifeline of the British Empire, will be seriously threatened. This is another thing that is difficult for the United Kingdom and the United States to accept. This is the second reason why the peace treaty with Italy is difficult to agree on.

In addition to the problem of dividing the former Italian colonies, there is also the problem of further dividing the territory within Italy itself. The area of ​​Fiume-Trieste was originally a very complicated area. Before the First World War, it belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but the residents here were Italians and Yugoslavs. After the First World War, the writer D'Annunzio raised the banner of righteousness in Fiume, and the area was returned to Italy. Trieste originally belonged to Austria and had Yugoslavs. Now Yugoslavia is demanding that it be划归划归to that country; and Yugoslavia, under the rule of Marshal Tito, is very close to Moscow. If Yugoslavia obtains Trieste, it is equivalent to the Soviet Union's influence extending to the Adriatic Sea, which is in direct conflict with Britain's traditional policy of controlling the Mediterranean. This is also a major factor that makes the peace treaty with Italy difficult to agree on. In addition, there is the Tyrol problem on the Austrian-Italian border, which originally belonged to Austria and was inhabited by Austrians and Italians. It was ceded to Italy after the First World War and remains so to this day. Of course, in addition to the issue of territorial division, there is also the issue of Italian reparations, and the opinions of various countries have not been一致.

In general, the main reason why it is difficult for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to agree on a peace treaty is that "power politics" is at play. Some countries are trying to dominate the world and want to expand their influence everywhere. This attempt will inevitably conflict with the original forces; therefore, agreement is difficult to obtain. According to the current situation, there is no doubt that the reason why it is difficult to agree on a peace treaty is that the policies of the Soviet Union are too far apart from the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States. The interests of the United Kingdom and the United States are not exactly the same. Their policies also have differences, but the attitudes of the United Kingdom and the United States towards the above-mentioned issues can be said to be somewhat similar. China does not participate in the drafting of the European peace treaty, which is obviously inconsistent with the principle that war cannot be divided and peace cannot be divided. However, since our allies are in charge of drafting the European peace treaty, even if we do not directly participate, we believe that international justice will still be upheld. We wish the Foreign Ministers Conference success!

### Optimism Permeates Foreign Ministers Conference; Soviet Union Shows No Sign of Concession on Balkan Treaty Issue; Agrees to Participation of United States and France; U.S. Representative Brings Proposals to Eliminate Tariffs

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 26th Telegram: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their second meeting in the Luxembourg Palace today. They first discussed the procedures decided yesterday, and then began to discuss the first item on the agenda, the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Italy. Discussions were still ongoing at the time of the broadcast. French Provisional President Gouin hosted a banquet tonight to entertain the foreign ministers of the four countries.

Of those in attendance today, the British Foreign Minister arrived first, and the Soviet representative arrived last. The Soviet delegation was very large, consisting of six cars. No communique will be issued as a result of today's meeting. It is expected that no official communique will be issued until the conference has reached a definitive result.

[United Press, Paris, 26th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was held in the Luxembourg Palace today. The Soviet Union showed flexibility on the issue of the right of the United States and France to participate in the treaty negotiations of the five Axis satellite countries, so the atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious. The Soviet Union's rejection of France's participation in the treaty negotiations with Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland, and Romania was the main reason for the failure of the London Foreign Ministers Conference last winter in September. The United States did not fight with Finland, and the United States will also be granted the right to attend the treaty negotiations with Finland. However, it is understood that the United States may not actually join the vote during the treaty with Finland. France can participate in the peace treaty negotiations of the five Axis satellites, but can only participate in the vote on the treaty with Italy.

[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] At the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the new European peace treaty, the Soviet Union declared that it would allow France to participate in the discussion of the peace treaties with the Balkan countries. This move has created a new atmosphere of optimism at the meeting. Molotov's statement that he would allow France to participate in the discussion of the Balkan peace treaties changed his decision announced at the London Foreign Ministers Conference last year, which was quite unexpected. Mr. Molotov said that he did not object to French observers attending the discussions on the Balkan countries and Finland, and the U.S. representative would also attend the discussions on the Finnish peace treaty, but without voting rights. The news spread, and representatives from various countries were quite optimistic, saying that Mr. Molotov's move may indicate that Moscow will also ease its attitude on other issues.

[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes is traveling to France to attend the Foreign Ministers Conference, bringing important proposals in the hope of breaking the deadlock in the European peace issue. Its content advocates that European countries abolish tariffs, implement free trade, and set a five-year period to accelerate the economic recovery of the European continent. However, Byrnes' advisors have conflicting opinions on this.

### First Meeting Ends Without Results

[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] According to official news tonight: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their first meeting in the Luxembourg Palace tonight, discussing the Balkan and German issues. As soon as they made contact, conflict arose. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and French Foreign Minister Bidault proposed that this conference should discuss and resolve the Ruhr issue. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov immediately expressed strong opposition. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 p.m. without any results.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their first meeting here yesterday under strict security. According to a communique issued by the French Foreign Ministry last night: The first meeting decided on the procedures to be adopted at this Foreign Ministers Conference, and then discussed the agenda of this conference. The Luxembourg Palace, where the meeting was held, was under extremely strict security. Only twenty or thirty senior representatives were allowed to enter the meeting place, and all others without special entry permits were turned away. The meeting room was in the Victor Hugo Memorial Hall in France, and the representatives sat around a round table. Bevin, Byrnes, Molotov, Bidault and the other four foreign ministers sat in armchairs, while the other attendants sat in chairs without armrests. Each foreign minister had an interpreter. Before the first meeting, each foreign minister had submitted a proposal on the procedures of the meeting, advocating that each foreign minister take turns serving as chairman. France was the inviting country, so Bidault served as chairman yesterday. The first item on the agenda was the content of the Italian peace treaty. It is generally expected that this Foreign Ministers Conference will continue for ten days to three weeks. Bidault said, "If it can help the agreement, I am willing to meet for two months to complete it."

### Molotov

Brought Bodyguards to the Meeting Place

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Molotov arrived at the Luxembourg Palace yesterday afternoon to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, accompanied by eight burly Soviet soldiers as bodyguards.

### Soviet Union Opposes Sending an Investigation Team; Security Council's Discussion of the Spanish Issue Reaches a Tense Stage; Representatives of Australia, France, and Poland Reach an Agreement; Agree to Review Each Representative's Previous Remarks

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: The Security Council's discussion of the Spanish issue has entered its most tense stage today. After the regular meeting began, the Australian representative immediately announced that the representatives of Australia, France, and Poland had reached a resolution after a night of consultation, agreeing to appoint a subcommittee to review the remarks made by each representative in the Security Council on the Spanish issue and to report to the Security Council as soon as possible. The meeting was then adjourned and rescheduled for discussion next Monday, where each representative will vote on whether to pass the resolution.

Today's meeting lasted only five minutes, the shortest of all meetings.

The content of the agreement reached by the French, Polish, and Australian representatives is as follows: "The Security Council is now paying attention to the situation in Spain and has been requested to declare that the Spanish situation does indeed endanger international security and peace. The Security Council, in view of the moral condemnation of the Franco regime by all parties, and the resolutions passed by the San Francisco Conference and the United Nations General Assembly on this issue, has decided to further review whether the current situation in Spain has endangered world security. If so, it will recommend practical measures to the United Nations. To achieve this task, the Security Council has appointed a five-member subcommittee to review the statements made by representatives in the Security Council and to conduct various necessary consultations in order to submit a report to the Security Council as soon as possible."

[Associated Press, New York, 25th] In the Security Council today, Soviet representative Gromyko strongly opposed sending a committee to investigate the Spanish case. The representatives debated each other for three and a half hours. Motions and amendments were proposed one after another, sometimes confusing some representatives. As a result of the debate, no resolution was reached.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Bulgaria has announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the Franco regime, and the Bulgarian Embassy in Spain has been ordered to close.

### Mussolini's Body Still Missing; Strange Letter Found on Coffin

[United Press, Rome, 25th] Interior Minister Romita announced today that a small number of people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of Mussolini's body. According to the Milan Police Chief, two cemetery night watchmen have been arrested, but it is not yet known whether they are among those arrested by Romita. It is rumored that Mussolini's body has been secretly reburied in Predappio. Romita denied this, saying that there are no clues as to where his body is now.

[Reuters, Milan, 26th] After Mussolini's body was stolen, a letter addressed to Mussolini was found on his coffin, signed by the "Central Committee of the Fascist Democratic Party." Milan newspapers only excerpted a few paragraphs of the letter and published them, with the general meaning: "Your Excellency Prime Minister, you are finally with us. We have asked the authorities to hold an honorable burial for your remains, but have been refused," and so on. The National Political Police of Italy have all been mobilized to search for Mussolini's body.

[Associated Press, Rome, 25th] A Rome newspaper warned today that Italian fascists may use the myth of resurrection to make people believe that Mussolini has been resurrected.

### International Financial Institutions to Commence Operations Early Next Month; Presidents to be Elected Separately by Boards of Directors

[United Press Washington, 24th] The International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, now informally referred to as the "World Fund" and the "World Bank," are scheduled to formally commence operations on May 6th and 7th. At that time, the two boards of directors, composed of representatives from twelve countries, will hold separate meetings. Their first order of business will be to elect the presidents of the two institutions. It is expected that it will take two months before financial and balancing operations can commence.

### Cabinet Formation Order for Japan to be Issued Imminently; Progressive Party Excluded; Four Parties Continue Negotiations

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 26th Dispatch] It has been five days since the Shidehara Cabinet resigned, and Shidehara has yet to recommend a new prime minister to the Emperor. Today at 4 PM, Shidehara visited the Imperial Palace to meet with the Emperor. It is rumored that he recommended a new prime minister to the Emperor, but according to reliable sources for our reporter, this rumor is inaccurate. After Shidehara's resignation, he engaged in negotiations with the Liberal, Socialist, and Cooperative parties in his capacity as leader of the Progressive Party, in order to form a new cabinet. As a result, the Socialist Party demanded a premiership position in the new cabinet, but the Liberal and Progressive parties did not agree, and the negotiations broke down. Since last night, the situation has changed again due to the alliances and separations of the parties.

The most notable aspect is the exclusion of the Progressive Party. After Shidehara became the president of the party, he hoped to form a "coalition government" of the Liberal, Socialist, and Progressive parties. The Liberal Party agreed to this proposal, but the Socialist Party consistently refused to allow the Progressive Party to participate. As the meetings between the Liberal and Socialist parties evolved into four-party meetings, Shidehara's ambition was clearly thwarted.

[Reconstruction Daily Tokyo, 26th] The committee of the Liberal, Socialist, Cooperative, and Communist parties of Japan reconvened its meeting at 5 PM today to discuss the prime minister issue.

It is widely believed that the structure of a joint cabinet of the Liberal and Socialist parties will be achieved, and the order to form a cabinet is expected to be issued in the next few days.

### Results of The Hague Negotiations Fail to Satisfy East Indies; Negotiations Soon to Continue in Java

[United Press Amsterdam, 25th] East Indies Interior Minister Soedharsono, having completed the negotiations in The Hague, stated on the eve of his departure back to Java that the negotiations between the Indonesian and Dutch governments did not meet his expectations. Details of the negotiations cannot be disclosed before reporting to Prime Minister Sjahrir, but it can be said that the negotiations were fruitless in both form and content. It is reported that the Dutch side had urged the East Indies delegation to postpone their departure until Saturday so that Dutch East Indies Governor-General Van Mook could participate in the final negotiations. The East Indies delegation refused this request and decided to depart by plane this morning. Van Mook and his advisors will also depart for Java on the 30th of this month. The negotiations between the Indonesian and Dutch governments began on the 9th of this month, during which sporadic fighting continued in Java. The Netherlands proposed granting the East Indies dominion status, while the East Indies demanded that Java and Sumatra be formed into a free state. The Netherlands would temporarily retain sovereignty over the other islands in the East Indies as a compromise.

Dutch Government Statement

[Reuters The Hague, 26th] The Dutch government issued a statement declaring that although the difficulties between Indonesia and the Netherlands have not been completely resolved, progress has been made on several points. The Dutch government has now been able to submit this issue to the Parliament, which will provide opinions as a basis for Dutch East Indies Lieutenant Governor Van Mook to continue negotiations in Java.

### Secret of German Recording Machine Discovered by U.S. Army; By Connecting This Machine to a Telephone, the Other Party's Words Can Be Recorded

[Reuters Berlin, 26th] The secret of the magnetic recording machine used by German submarines has been discovered by the U.S. Army. When the Nazi Party was in power, the telephones of foreign diplomats, journalists, and other suspicious individuals were secretly connected to these machines. Every word spoken during the call was recorded on the machine. Inside submarines, these recorders could be used to detect the sound of ship propellers and locate enemy ships. In peacetime, if this machine is installed on a telephone, it can also record the other party's words when the owner is not present. A journalist can report the day's findings to the machine without having to return to the newspaper, and simply send the audio recording to the newspaper.

### Seeing the American Recovery on the Streets of New York (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

New York, with a population of seven million, is now not only an American city, but also a global metropolis. On the streets of New York, if you walk along Broadway or cross Forty-Second Street, you can see people of various skin colors, hair types, and eye colors, all equally busy with their affairs. The difficult war is over, and there is no trace of war on the streets of New York. The bright red and green neon lights illuminate every street and corner of New York. The war destroyed the ancient European modern civilization and damaged the budding industries of Asia, but for the New World, it has become more robust and prosperous than ever before.

New York is not only a city of industrial and commercial production and trade, but also a city of massive consumption. An American economist estimated that 75 percent of the total industrial production in the United States is consumed by women. This is perfectly demonstrated in New York. Don't believe it? Step into large companies such as "Bonwit Teller" and "Macy's," and you will notice that most of the customers upstairs and downstairs are American ladies. In New York, the most difficult item to buy now is stockings, especially the transparent and durable "nylon" type. This does not mean that the United States lacks stocking production. In fact, the United States is currently the country that manufactures the most stockings (followed by Switzerland), simply because American women consume them too much. Often, when a batch of stockings arrives at a store, an advertisement is published in the newspaper, and the next day, people immediately line up to buy them, and the goods are sold out in less than half a day.

In New York, it is not only stockings that are difficult to buy, but also Arrow or "Manhattan" brand dress shirts, which are very difficult to find, and each purchase is limited to one item. Before I came to the United States, my friends in Europe all thought: "Just put up with it for now, once you get to the United States, you can have whatever you want": However, the reality is not like that. It is said that the population of New York is increasing daily. The average purchasing power after the war boom is astonishing. Some of the industries that were stalled by the war have not yet fully recovered. Therefore, production and consumption are often disconnected invisibly. To give a very obvious example, there are several typewriter companies in the United States. Before the war, they were all capable competitors in the international market, but now they do not have sufficient production to meet the needs of the domestic market in the United States. In New York, if you want to buy a "Remington" typewriter, you must pre-order it two months in advance. Many people are eager to use one and cannot wait that long, so they buy readily available Swiss products. It is said that light-weight typewriters made in Switzerland have experienced unexpected sales in the United States in the months since the end of the war. Even though the U.S. Customs imposes high taxes on industrial products from Europe, many people are still willing to pay a high price to purchase them. At the same time, on the other hand, I heard a friend say that the "Remington" company is spending a large amount of money commissioning talent to design a "Chinese typewriter," in order to compete for the vast market in China in the future. A famous Chinese writer has already designed a fairly perfect plan, which is being tested by the Remington company.

The capitalist economic system puts the market first. Currently, many American exporters know the importance of the Chinese market. However, up to this stage, they are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. They believe that the exchange rate in China is not stable enough, and they are afraid of suffering losses in future exchange rate fluctuations. More than 20,000 bales of Japanese raw silk have already been shipped to New York. The New York Post used a rather eye-catching headline saying: "No worries about stocking materials." It also provided numerical estimates that 20,000 bales of raw silk can produce tens of millions of pairs of stockings. Isn't our China a country known for its silk? Aren't we also paying attention to export trade?

I believe that what is even more scarce than stockings and typewriters in New York is housing. The British Conservative Party government collapsed in last year's election because it did not have enough houses for the citizens of London. Paris, France, did not suffer from war damage, but finding a house is even more difficult than reaching the sky. It's no different in New York. The other day, I met Yang Yongqing, the former president of Soochow University. He had just received a letter from home, saying that Shanghai and Nanjing are having difficulties finding houses. "The housing shortage has now become a global problem." Whenever a war passes, the population is bound to be heavily concentrated in cities. Concentrating in cities, the city's housing becomes a problem. It is said that before the war, although the population of New York was already very large, it was still easy to find houses in the Manhattan area. In the upper part of Manhattan, the windows of laundromats often had advertisements posted for houses for rent. This time when I came to New York, I searched for three days according to the map, but I didn't see a single advertisement. The old laundromat owner just shook his head. Several large courtyards ran a very narrow classified advertisement in the New York Times. The New York Times is published at one o'clock in the morning. At one thirty, someone drove a car to reserve the rental. From two o'clock onwards, until the next day, the phone rang non-stop, all wanting to rent the house. The landlady really couldn't stand it anymore and took the receiver off the hook: "This is really annoying, it's not like we're the only house in all of New York!" The landlady frowned and told me this story. (To be continued)

### It is Said That Shi Yu is Very Eloquent, Shifting All Blame; Many Sophistries During This Morning's Public Trial; Claimed His Conduct Was Different From Ordinary Traitors

[Our Reporter] Shi Yu, who successively held the positions of puppet Minister of Railways, puppet Minister of Construction, and puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province, was arrested by military authorities after the victory. He was transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation, which concluded with a public prosecution. Yesterday at 2:30 PM, the High Court held a public trial. Because the court had pre-issued admission tickets to limit the number of spectators, order in the courtroom was well-maintained. Family members of the defendant, wearing dark glasses, also attended the hearing. When Shi's daughter passed by him as he was being escorted back to prison, she softly called out "Papa," to which Shi responded with a somber silence. At just after 2:30, Court President Liu Yugui, along with Judges Cai Jin and Qiu Huan-ying, Prosecutor Dai Rong, and Clerk Yang Daqi, took their seats. The defendant looked dejected and unwell, and was escorted onto the stand by two court police officers. Shi was wearing a gray gabardine jacket and black satin shoes with white soles. His temples were already streaked with gray, and his eyes were bloodshot and sleepy. He held in his hand a written confession he had prepared in prison. He stood at the defendant's stand.

Court President Liu first asked his age, native place, address, and occupation. He replied that he was 56 years old, from Wenzhou, residing at 41 Avenue Albert, and previously worked in education. Next, Prosecutor Dai stated the main points of the indictment, divided into several points: conspiring with an enemy nation to collude with the Japanese, carrying out the "cleansing the countryside" campaign, expanding the puppet security forces, issuing public bonds, and paying tribute for warplanes. (See yesterday's newspaper for details of the indictment.) Court President Liu then asked the defendant if he had any defense. Shi then took out and put on his glasses, took out the white paper from his hand, and said he could

Respond to Each Point Separately

(1) Regarding the indictment's claim that he colluded with the enemy under the guise of inspecting railways, the defendant said that in November of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], he was ordered by the puppet Executive Yuan to lead two section chiefs and two secretaries to Japan for inspection, staying for more than ten days, but that there were no other consequences. He had no interactions with any elements of the Japanese government or public. He said that he had studied mining engineering and had been unemployed before the incident. During the war, he took up puppet positions under various unavoidable circumstances. However, the duties he undertook were all passive in nature, and he never had any intention of colluding with the enemy. (2) Regarding the three points mentioned in the indictment about carrying out the "cleansing the countryside" campaign, expanding the puppet security forces, and paying tribute for warplanes, the defendant said that he was already serving in a puppet position at the time, and of course could not completely disregard orders from superiors. At that time, the puppet army was of poor quality, so he reorganized it to alleviate the suffering of the people, taking over from the enemy. The weapons were inferior, and the number of personnel was even smaller than before, so there was no question of expansion. The purpose of the reorganization was to prevent them from acting as bullies and harming ordinary people, and to instill patriotic ideas in them. Therefore, many puppet security forces were able to liaise with guerrilla units, exhausting the enemy. The defendant often warned them that enduring temporary grievances was not important, and that they must work together to serve the country during the general counter-offensive. As for carrying out the "cleansing the countryside" campaign, it was done on the orders of the puppet "Cleansing the Countryside" Committee. Wang Jingwei served as the chairman of the committee, Zhou Fo-hai and Chen Gong-bo served as vice-chairmen, and Li Shi-qun served as the secretary-general. The name "cleansing the countryside" also originated entirely from Japanese demands. The military aspects were the responsibility of the Japanese, while the Nanjing government was only responsible for administrative matters. The target was the New Fourth Army. The defendant was originally unwilling to carry out this matter, but there were orders from superiors. In reality, "cleansing the countryside" was just empty talk, impossible and meaningless. Regarding the payment of tribute for warplanes, it was a general order issued by the puppet government to all provinces and cities in the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943]. At that time, Shanghai paid a total of 50 to 60 million, while Zhejiang delayed repeatedly before paying 4 million puppet currency. Therefore, the prosecutor's claim that Zhejiang paid 14 million is inaccurate. (3) Regarding the issuance of construction bonds, it was the responsibility of his predecessor as Minister of Construction, Chen Jun-hui. The defendant served as puppet Minister of Construction for a very short period. At that time, the military situation was tense, and all land and water transportation was under enemy control. Therefore, apart from water conservancy projects in Danyang County and East Taihu Lake, there was no other work. Although he served in a puppet position, he always aimed to love the country and save the people. As for going to Nanjing in March of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940] to take up a puppet position, it was entirely due to the urging of Mei Si-ping and the Shanghai enemy military police. The defendant went on to list many pieces of evidence to the contrary, saying that his going to Nanjing to take up a puppet position was with the consent of Mao Zhao-zhi of the Military Intelligence Bureau, and that he often provided information afterward. Later, Mao was captured by the enemy, and the defendant arranged for his release. Mao led his son, Mao Jing-quan, to Nanjing to thank him before going to the interior. After the Pacific War broke out, he came to Shanghai from Hong Kong again and introduced Guo Zhen to serve as the puppet police chief of Wuxing, to act as a military liaison. He also introduced Wu Li-xing to go to Ningbo to be responsible for liaison. He also instigated the puppet troops of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to plan for internal support during the counter-offensive. Later, Mao died of illness in Shanghai on April 23rd of that year, and his son entered the puppet Ministry of Construction, holding the nominal title of specialist, and is now also working in the Military Intelligence Bureau. In addition, he successively bailed out Zheng Qing-ken, a member of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, Gong Wei-zhen of the Three Youth League, Kong Qing-shi of the Loyal National Salvation Army, Chen Zhong, and others. The Fourth War Zone's Tang En-bo sent Zhang Yu-lin and Xu Fu, and the Zhejiang Loyal National Salvation Army's Ruan Qing-yuan sent Yang Chong-ming, to contact the defendant. At that time, Wu Pei-yun, the director of both KMT party branches, came to Shanghai and went to Nanjing with Chen Gong-bo to discuss how to coordinate the counter-offensive. Therefore, although the defendant served in a puppet position, his attitude was always for the country and was not the same as that of ordinary traitors. He asked the court to make a clear judgment. The defendant also listed various pieces of evidence against the Japanese collection of military rice. At this point, Prosecutor Dai

stood up again to supplement, saying that the defendant had also served as a member of the puppet Central Political Committee and a member of the Materials Control Committee. The defendant admitted to all of this without hesitation, but said that they were only nominal titles and that major decisions were made by Wang, Zhou, Chen, and others. The court then questioned Shi using transcripts of speeches made by Shi published in puppet newspapers at the time. Shi replied either "mistaken" or "no such thing." As for the Japanese government awarding Shi a second-class medal, he replied that it was an exchange between the Japanese and Nanjing governments. However, the defendant only saw it in the newspaper and never received it. When asked about the procedures for liaising with the counter-offensive, he replied that there were puppet security forces in Zhejiang, Ren Yuan-dao and Xu Bo-cheng in Jiangsu, Sun Liang-cheng in northern Jiangsu, and a puppet garrison division in Nanjing. Finally, when asked about the defendant's assets, he answered with a bitter smile, saying that the defendant was a teacher and had no assets. The trial came to an end here. The defendant requested that Ruan Qing-yuan, Zhang Yu-lin, Mao Jing-quan, Xu Fu, Yang Chong-ming, He Pei-rong, and Li Qi be summoned for questioning next time.

### Ai Ji-cheng, Sun Zu-ji Indicted, Summoned for Trial This Morning, Xu Ji-dun and Others

[Our Reporter] Chen Ji-cheng (puppet ambassador to Manchukuo and concurrently chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee) and Sun Zu-ji (successively puppet director of finance of Zhejiang, director of the Insurance Supervisory Bureau, and mayor of Hangzhou) have been investigated by the High Procuratorate, which has concluded the investigation. Public prosecutions have been filed.

Yesterday, the office also summoned and interrogated Zhang Lian-fang, Zhu Shun-lin, Cheng Zhi-liang, Liu Quan, Lu Bing-yuan, Qian Jie-yi, Wang Wei-cai, Feng Wen-qi, and others.

This morning at 9:00 AM, the treason case of Xu Ji-dun, Xie Zhong-fu, and others will be tried.

### Three Traitors Sentenced, Sarri Displays a Stubborn Attitude

[Our Reporter] The High Court yesterday announced the sentences in several treason cases: (1) Jiao Bai-quan, secretary and concurrently chief of the enterprise section of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government's Propaganda Department, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. (2) Kang Lu-qiao, the puppet chief of Sanlin Town in Shanghai County, and Kang Fu, the puppet chief of Nanxing Township, were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. Wang Fu-qi, the director of the Joint Office of the Seven Townships of Sanlin Town, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of civil rights. The property of all the above defendants will be confiscated, except for a portion to be reserved for the necessary living expenses of their families. (3) The case of Feng Yao-fu, a translator for the enemy military police, was transferred to the local court due to a jurisdictional error.

Sarri, the former deputy director of the French Concession Police, and his assistant, Aminov (the chief inspector of the police force), were arrested and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation and public prosecution because they had assisted the Japanese, harmed Chinese merchants and residents, disrupted our war efforts, and supplied the Japanese with military supplies during the war. Yesterday morning, the High Court opened a trial. Sarri was unusually stubborn, claiming that the Chinese court had no jurisdiction but said he did not plan to protest. He pleaded innocent. The other defendant, Aminov, denied wrongdoing. Subsequently, Baodaxiang Silk Store and Ding Fangyuan described the defendants' acts of extortion. The court ordered a postponement for further interrogation.

### The Third Route Army Military Tribunal Accepts More Than Thirty Cases

[Our Reporter] Liu Shi-fang, the president of the Third Route Army Headquarters Military Tribunal, told reporters yesterday: The tribunal is currently handling more than 30 cases, involving more than 80 war criminals. However, two-thirds of them lack witness testimony and physical evidence. These war criminals, who cannot be investigated, will be returned to the prisoner of war management office. The reporter was surprised by Liu's remarks, as many citizens had reported enemy crimes to the local court's procuratorate. When asked about this, Liu immediately replied that the purpose of these reports may often be to take revenge. Because most people cannot confirm the names of these war criminals when reporting, they cannot be considered strong evidence in practice. Liu's current rank is major general, and he wears a grass-green military uniform, but his conversation is humorous and still reveals the character of a scholar. He once told his friend: "Ordinary people always call me Dr. Liu or Professor Liu. One day, when I was having dinner with some foreign friends, they kept calling me 'General.' I didn't know who they were talking to. Later, I saw them looking at me, and I realized they were talking about me!" His sense of humor is evident.

### President Truman's Personal Representative, Hoover, to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

After arriving in Shanghai, Hoover will stay at General Wedemeyer's former residence. It is reported that Hoover will stay in Shanghai for three or four days, but there are no definite plans to go to Nanjing or Chongqing.

### Two "Female Stars" on the Blacklist, Xia Peizhen Cries Upon Hearing the Verdict, Yuan Meiyun Not Allowed Bail

[Our Reporter] In the case of Xia Peizhen's drug addiction, the local court sentenced her to one year in prison yesterday afternoon and ordered her to be sent to a hospital for detoxification. Xia cried loudly after hearing the verdict.

The drug addiction case of movie star Yuan Meiyun was reopened by the Third Criminal Court of the local court at 3:00 PM yesterday. Before 2:00 PM, the audience seats were already full, and there was almost no room for latecomers. Some even climbed onto the windowsills to watch the trial. Yuan was still wearing the red plaid coat and black cheongsam from the initial trial, with black satin flower shoes on her feet. Her attitude was calmer than before, but her voice was very low. It is said that she had smoked opium because of stomach problems, but was afraid of becoming addicted, so she stopped and started from time to time. Recently, because the police bureau banned drugs, she has been detoxifying and switched to drinking medicinal liquids. She also hired Dr. Cao Zishou to treat her. Because the witness, Dr. Cao Zishou, had not arrived, the situation of Yuan's detoxification could not be proven, so the court adjourned the trial to another date. Yuan also hired lawyers Yue Junwei and Huang Menggang to appear in court yesterday to defend her and requested bail, which the court refused. (The picture shows the situation when she was sadly on trial)

### Measures for the Use of U.S. Cotton Loans Determined

According to the Central Bank, the procedures for the use of the 33 million U.S. cotton loan have been determined. Detailed procedures have been notified to designated banks, foreign exchange brokers, cotton importers and factories, and cotton trading companies. This loan can be used to pay for U.S. cotton that arrives on or after March 4th of this year, but the purchase contract must be notified to the Central Bank before September 14th of this year, and the U.S. cotton must be shipped before March 14th of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947]. All of the above conditions (including U.S. cotton that has been sold but not yet settled) are eligible for this loan. The new measures stipulate that the sale of this U.S. cotton and the application for foreign exchange will still be handled according to customary practices, but all U.S. cotton, unless specifically authorized by the Central Bank or because the collateral is not in compliance, will be paid for in accordance with the new measures. This U.S. cotton loan will be handled by the Bank of China as designated by the government and the Central Bank, but U.S. cotton buyers can still handle foreign exchange settlement procedures at any designated bank.

### Tricycle Pullers Petition for Licenses, Return Satisfied

[Our Reporter] A delegation petitioning for licenses for newly manufactured tricycles in the city, along with more than 1,000 people from eight tricycle companies, took hundreds of vehicles to the city government yesterday morning to petition for the issuance of licenses to maintain their business. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau met with them on behalf of the mayor. Zhu Wenguang and other representatives of the tricycle companies stated three points: (1) Each vehicle is borrowed at high interest rates by two or three pullers, and the livelihood of several families depends on this vehicle. (2) Before the Public Works Bureau issues licenses, please notify the police bureau not to detain them. (3) 1,400 tricycles have been registered by the eight companies, and it is requested that licenses be issued as soon as possible. Director Zhao then replied to the representatives with two principles decided by the municipal government meeting: (1) Privately owned vehicles must be registered at designated locations within five days. (2) Vehicles owned by the companies that are damaged will not be registered. The representatives were satisfied and left.

These war criminals had previously imprisoned five Filipinos in the Ward Road Prison, but now they are detained in the same prison.

### All Movie Theaters to Resume Business, Method of Assigning Seats Temporarily Allowed to be Postponed

[Our Reporter] Because of the assigned seating issue, eight of the city's 39 movie theaters were ordered to close by the police bureau. The theaters appealed, but there was no result, leading to the suspension of all performances at 2:00 PM yesterday. In the morning, Li Diyun, the managing director of the Movie Theater Association and manager of the Dahua Theater, went to the city government to meet with the mayor for discussions. After the mayor brought it up at the municipal meeting, there was still no satisfactory result. Subsequently, Xu Jiqing, the chairman of the Municipal Temporary Council, and Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, jointly submitted a petition to the mayor. The mayor then approved the resumption of business of all theaters (including the eight closed theaters). The method of assigning seats is temporarily allowed to be postponed. Therefore, all theaters resumed business starting with the evening performances.

### Customs Employees Petition to Improve Treatment

Authorities Refuse to Pay Salaries Based on Cost of Living Index

[Our Reporter] More than 2,000 internal affairs customs officers and customs servants of the Jianghai Customs Department went on a full-scale slowdown strike starting at 9:00 AM yesterday due to meager treatment. Representatives were sent to Li Du, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Hede Road Customs, and Deputy Customs Director Ding Guitang to present three requests: (1) Request for the issuance of relief funds for two months. (2) Request for salaries to be based on the cost of living index. (3) Previous temporary loans cannot be repaid. After Li and Ding consulted with Minister Yu at 5:00 PM, the following responses were given: (1) The request for the issuance of relief funds cannot be granted. (2) The cost of living index is designed for workers, and customs officers should be treated as civil servants. (3) The previous temporary loans will be temporarily allowed to be repaid later. It was also stated that if the slowdown strike continues, dismissal will be imposed. All employees dispersed unhappy after hearing this reply.

### A Word in Yixuan, the Mei Troupe's Performance Has Three Difficulties, Finally Solved Smoothly - A Pity -

Starting today, the Mei Troupe officially performs at the Nanjing Grand Theater, with a scheduled performance period of twelve days. If possible, it may be extended for a few days after the twelve-day period expires. Shanghai people have been separated from Dr. Mei for a long time. Although he performed several Kunqu operas last time, Kunqu is ultimately highbrow and unpopular. People who like to listen to Peking opera cannot help but feel slightly disappointed. With this public performance, people can enjoy a great Peking opera performance.

Yesterday, the reporter and Mr. Ni Qiuping, a famous piano ticket in the city, specially went to Lantian Road to visit Mr. Mei. Usually, Mr. Mei hums in his residence, and Mr. Ni plays the piano. Unfortunately, Mr. Mei and Mr. Wang Qinsheng went out to visit guests, but we saw Mr. Xu Lanyuan, who had been separated for ten years, and chatted happily in the quiet Xueyixuan. It turned out that this performance can really be said to be extremely difficult. First, the Mei Troupe is famous, and every new tune always sweeps the country. However, Xu Lanyuan is extremely busy in Beijing. He has shares in Zudelou, and Zhulanzhuan (a famous bamboo shop in Beijing) also needs him to preside over it. He has never played the strings for eight years of war. This time, it was Dr. Mei's friendship that made him fly to Shanghai. Wang Shaoqing used to play the huqin for Li Shifang, but did not play the erhu. This time, it was also the first time in eight years that he played the old tune. In addition, Wang Qinsheng's huqin is Yang Shizhong, so this performance is a collection of three masters of Jinghu and Erhu, not to mention the vocalization, it is enough to listen to the interlude.

Second, it is difficult to find supporting roles. Although Wang Qinsheng's name seems unfamiliar in Shanghai, he is indeed a rising star with unlimited prospects. He is the top student of Tan Xiaopei and has long been popular in the old capital. The pure role is still Lian Rong, the old partner when he went to the United States, and the young student is Jiang Xiangmiao. Yu Zhenfei, it seems that selling horses still has the possibility of being staged.

Third, the most difficult thing is the place - I didn't expect that even "King Mei" had to exhaust his efforts to find the Nanjing Grand Theater! If it weren't for help from many parties, it would simply be a hero with no place to use his "talent". The Nanjing Grand Theater has never performed Peking opera, and the rental fee is quite considerable. According to their estimates, there is very little certainty of making money in this performance. Mei Wanhua has always been righteous and generous in his life. The main purpose of this performance is really to repay the millions of Mei fans.

In order to adjust the crowding, the first program "Cosmic Front" will be performed for three consecutive days, and the second program is "Bao Lian Deng", which will probably be performed for two consecutive days.

Mei Dawang's eldest son, Bao Chen, has also returned from Chongqing, and he has been busy setting up the ticket stalls these days. It looks like a full house for twelve consecutive performances is stable.

### Tokyo Allied Military Tribunal to Open Within Ten Days; Prosecutor Xiang Zhejiong Arrives in Shanghai on Official Business

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Tokyo, from General MacArthur's Headquarters: Mr. Xiang Zhejiong, the Chinese prosecutor for the United Nations Military Tribunal, flew to Shanghai on an American military plane on the 24th for official business. When interviewed yesterday by a reporter, he said that the number of countries participating in the tribunal has reached eleven. In addition to the nine countries that accepted Japan's surrender, India and the Philippines have recently joined. The trial will officially open within ten days. However, it may be postponed for some time after it opens to allow the defendants sufficient time to prepare their defense. The estimated duration of this trial is five to six months, but if it is not completed by then, it will have to be extended. China has collected a great deal of evidence, which is currently being translated into English with great haste. Mr. Xiang's stay in Shanghai will be short, and he will fly back to his post in two or three days.

[United Press Tokyo 25th] According to the Far East International Tribunal Prosecutor's Office: The indictment against Hideki Tojo and other major Japanese war criminals has been printed and bound, and will be submitted to the International Tribunal no later than next Tuesday.

### City Councilors Election Tomorrow; a Whistle Will Signal the Start of Citywide Voting; Mayor to Broadcast Election Significance Tonight; Planes to Drop Colorful Leaflets

The election of city councilors for this city will be held tomorrow. At six o'clock in the morning, a whistle will be blown to signal the start of voting for citizens, which will continue until six o'clock in the afternoon. If necessary, it will be extended until ten o'clock in the evening. The more than one thousand public office candidates participating in the election will then be determined, and the city's one hundred and eighty-one councilors will be officially elected. The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau has made all the necessary arrangements for the election procedures. The one hundred polling places throughout the city will be selected by each district. If needed, each district can add one or two more to facilitate voting. To encourage citizens to pay attention to voting, the Municipal Government, with the approval of the Aviation Committee, has dispatched planes to drop leaflets at nine o'clock this morning and nine o'clock tomorrow morning. Mayor Qian will give a broadcast speech on the significance of the election at nine o'clock tonight on the Shanghai Radio Station. The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau has appointed fifty-eight election supervisors and assistants to monitor the public voting in each district. For the sake of caution, the Municipal Government has specifically sent a letter requesting the city's first Provisional Councilors to mobilize and observe in all election districts and professional groups. The Secretariat of the council approved the letter and has sent notices to each Provisional Councilor to participate.

### Whether Executives of Puppet Organizations Can Participate in the Election

There has been some doubt as to whether those who served as directors and supervisors of professional organizations under the puppet regime can participate in the election. The Shanghai City Councilor Election Office has submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior, which was then forwarded to the Executive Yuan for interpretation, stating in brief: Those who served as directors and supervisors of professional organizations under the puppet municipal government are, in accordance with Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, prohibited from being candidates for public office for a certain number of years. As for how long this "certain number of years" should be, it should be determined by the Executive Yuan in consultation with the Examination Yuan, and further orders will be issued. This interpretation has been sent by the City Election Office to the Social Affairs Bureau, which will in turn notify all relevant organizations.

### Meeting with General Ma Zhanshan; Willing to Use the Waters of the Songhua River as Ink and the Lush Forests of the Heilongjiang River as a Brush to Paint a Portrait of General Ma

— Special Reporter Zhao Haosheng, Chongqing Air Dispatch, 20th of This Newspaper

General Ma Zhanshan's fame and achievements are as radiant as the perennial snow on the peaks of Changbai Mountain. "Ma Zhanshan" is a glorious name forever associated with "the Northeast"! As the global war that arose over the Northeast issue has ended victoriously, today, the Northeast issue has once again become a matter of global concern, and those who care about the Northeast issue are all watching General Ma Zhanshan's movements.

General Ma Zhanshan arrived in Chongqing a month ago, coming from Datong via Beiping. Seeing General Ma, the reporter felt as if he was seeing the anti-Japanese history that began in elementary school in his memory. This sixty-two-year-old general is still heroic and magnanimous, as brilliant and active as the heroic history he has written over the past ten years.

Signature for this newspaper, Long flight, slightly haggard after illness.

He was wearing a new-style army uniform made of grass-green homespun. His lean and not-so-tall figure looked truly slightly aged. However, his spirit, his heroism, was as strong as ever. He had a short, flat haircut, and his silver-white hair roots were shining brightly. His face was full of vitality, and although lean, it was by no means as slack as that of the average elderly person. This time, he came from Beiping, and the long flight was tiring. After getting off the plane, he fell ill. The day the reporter saw General Ma, his complexion was still showing signs of post-illness fatigue.

Anyone who has seen General Ma will remember his eyes full of moving power. Those eyes, which are not very big, have a bright and piercing brilliance, embedded in his gaunt face, appearing deep and majestic. From those eyes, you can know how General Ma's history of more than ten years of heroic fighting was written, and you can be even more certain that this sixty-two-year-old general has not aged.

Pure accent, full of cordial charm

General Ma speaks with a pure Northeastern accent. That accent is deep, sonorous, full of simple, sincere, cordial, and moving emotions. General Ma has a commonly used phrase, which is—"That's what I always think in my head." The pronunciation of the word "that," in particular, fully expresses the special charm of the Northeastern dialect.

When General Ma talked about his anti-Japanese war of more than ten years, his explanation was very simple: after the "September 18th Incident," it was to disrupt the enemy so that they could not occupy the Northeast peacefully. The volunteer army led by General Ma became a symbol that the Northeast would not fall. General Ma's fame was the source of the enemy's perpetual unease. At that time, no Japanese soldiers or civilians did not know General Ma Zhanshan, and none did not respect and fear General Ma Zhanshan. They had pictures drawn everywhere and offered rewards for capturing General Ma. In the end, they even deceived themselves and displayed General Ma's clothes, hats, and leather boots in Japanese exhibition halls, propagating that General Ma had been killed. This shows how great a threat General Ma posed to the enemy!

Advanced age, not yet time to retire

After the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast came to an end, General Ma originally intended to rest, but then came the "July 7th Incident," and a full-scale anti-Japanese war broke out. General Ma accepted the orders of the supreme leader without hesitation and took on the responsibility of Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Advance Army, Northeast Pacification Envoy, and Chairman of Heilongjiang Province. For the past eight years, General Ma has been facing off against the enemy in various parts of Shaanxi until the victory of the War of Resistance. After the victory, General Ma felt that his mission was complete, and that he was old and should rest, so he earnestly requested his resignation from Chairman Chiang. This time, when he was summoned to Chongqing, he again requested to resign in person. However, as one elderly speaker said at a welcoming meeting: "Not only will Chairman Chiang not allow General Ma to resign, but the people of the whole country will not allow General Ma to resign."

Northeastern compatriots, love the country and love the leader

Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, General Ma has a decisive judgment, which is "absolutely not to allow the existence of illegal forces." This sixty-two-year-old man has the most ardent love for his country and homeland, and therefore he hates those who undermine peaceful reunification. He said even more firmly: "The people of the Northeast love the country and love the leader. This enthusiasm cannot be insulted by any force." At the same time, he eagerly anticipates the peaceful construction of the Northeast. At a welcoming meeting for overseas Chinese in Chongqing, he said that he was willing to be an introducer. He asked overseas Chinese to actively invest and develop in the Northeast. He is now employed as the Chairman of the Northeast Nine Provinces Guidance Committee of the China Production Promotion Association. He hopes to contribute to the construction of his homeland.

Historical guarantee, write greater achievements

During his twenty-nine-day stay in Chongqing, he was summoned by Chairman Chiang several times, and flew back to Beiping ten days ago. This old general, who has been closely connected with the Northeast for more than ten years, has a very high level of influence in the Northeast. Today, when the Northeast is in a state of extreme chaos, General Ma's movements are indeed the most valued by the people of the whole country. History will guarantee that General Ma will use his shining pen to write even more glorious achievements for the country and his homeland!

With this wish, the reporter dipped into the clear ink of the Songhua River and used bright colors as lush as the forests of the Heilongjiang River to create the above portrait of General Ma of the past, present, and future.

General's thoughts, recalling ten years of war history

In the preceding paragraphs, I have given a general portrait of General Ma Zhanshan as I saw him before leaving Chongqing. From the old general's brow and the wrinkles carved by war and time, people can see many serious and heavy emotions buried in his heart.

In Chongqing, I met a leader who had followed General Ma Zhanshan in the anti-Japanese war during the Northeast Volunteer Army period and talked about one of the old general's most heavy-hearted concerns. This is a story from more than ten years ago, a story that has only been confirmed over the past ten years, and a deep yearning.

After the "September 18th Incident," General Ma Zhanshan led his subordinates, renting many Northeastern youths, and launched a war against the rulers. They fought under extremely difficult conditions. The first period was to use the enemy's weapons to wage large-scale wars, and the second period was to wage guerrilla warfare. It was during this period that the enemy drew pictures and offered rewards for capturing General Ma. It was also during this period that the enemy displayed General Ma's clothes and hats in the exhibition hall, propagating that General Ma had been killed.

The army led by General Ma constantly maneuvered with the enemy. Finally, due to the increasing pressure from the enemy and their lack of supplies and ammunition, although a large-scale fundraising and support movement had been launched in Guannei, it could not reach the soldiers. In this desperate situation, General Ma led his basic force of 20,000 people to retreat into Soviet territory. At that time, the Soviet government treated them very well, which they were very grateful for. Soon, they moved from Soviet territory to Xinjiang. However, after arriving in Xinjiang, only 14,000 of the original 20,000 people remained. In addition to the 1,000 who died of disease or deserted along the way, there were still 5,000 people left in Soviet territory. These 5,000 people were all young students who had joined the volunteer army out of patriotic enthusiasm.

An important knot in the current stage

It is said that these soldiers left in a foreign country have been rigorously trained by the Soviet Union in the past ten years. However, because communication with the country has been cut off, General Ma misses their lives very much.

Of the 14,000 people who flowed to Xinjiang, many were killed by Sheng Shicai in the past ten years. General Ma also often remembers the exile life of these ten thousand people with great concern.

Now the War of Resistance has been won, and the difficult days of the past ten years should come to an end. General Ma has recently received letters from his former subordinates in Xinjiang, requesting General Ma to find a way to send them home immediately. General Ma has presented this matter to Chairman Chiang in person and is planning to properly settle them so that they can each find their place and be demobilized together with the national anti-Japanese forces. It is said that the 5,000 people left in the Soviet Union have now all appeared in the Northeast.

In the chaos of the Northeast, the kinetic energy of these 5,000 people in the chaos has become a matter of concern for those who care about the Northeast issue and has become an important "knot" in the complex Northeast issue.

### An Account of the "Liberated Area" in Northern Jiangsu: The True Face of Punishing "Traitors" and Governance

— Zhong Ming

I am a poor teacher from northern Jiangsu. Recently, the "Democratic Government" in our "Liberated Area" in northern Jiangsu launched a campaign to punish "traitors." Although I never participated in the puppet organization, because I had received considerable education, the instructors and local chiefs often came to my residence to "pay their respects." How could I bear so many "respects"? Therefore, I had no choice but to flee to Shanghai half a month ago. Now, I am writing down what I personally witnessed in the so-called "Liberated Area" in northern Jiangsu and submitting it for your readers' consideration.

"Self-Renewal" Registration

After the Communist army "liberated" each city, it ordered a group of puppet officials to undergo "self-renewal" registration and organized "Current Affairs Study Groups" to train them in batches. Three "guarantees" and four "requirements" were proposed at the meetings. The so-called three "guarantees" after the training were: (1) guaranteed status (with civil rights), (2) guaranteed property (even corrupt wealth would not be investigated), and (3) guaranteed employment. The so-called four "requirements" were: first, to absolutely believe in the "Democratic Government"; second, to be thoroughly honest (past political experiences must be confessed); third, to accuse (those who worked under the central government must accuse their former superiors); and fourth, to report (those who did not surrender themselves as traitors or were not honest enough must be reported). Upon graduation, a portion was selected to work for the "Democratic Government," and the rest were dismissed and sent home. At the time, the puppet officials were grateful for the great virtue of the "Democratic Government."

"Public Trial" Work

However, recently, the "Democratic Government" has revealed its true face. It not only rigorously launched a campaign to punish "traitors," but also eradicated "three capitals" (intellectuals, the bourgeoisie, and people of reputation). The method was to establish public schools and grievance committees in each town, forcing one person from each proletarian household to participate. The public schools did not teach literacy but carried out reporting and trial work. Each school had a school committee (one person from each unit) responsible for investigation, clearly investigating a group of puppet officials, "three capitals" elements, etc., and reporting to the instructor, or the students could report them. Then, they would be arrested by the Public Security Bureau and taught to confess to the public at the public school. After the confession, the people would conduct a "public trial." Whether it was truly the people's will, only heaven knows!

Regarding "public trials," there were also the following types: (1) those with property were fined rice (never money); (2) those with knowledge, reputation, or so-called "national agents" were sentenced to imprisonment, shackles, and confinement. In serious cases, a mass meeting would be held, and they would be executed by shooting; (3) for petty traitors, those with insufficient knowledge and no money, they would be detained in "people's prisons" (not allowed to leave their residence within a certain period); (4) for special circumstances, they would be tattooed on the face and paraded through the streets; (5) for those who could not deliver the rice fines on time or whom they deemed necessary, their property would be confiscated (all indoor items would be taken away).

Since the launch of the so-called "punishment of traitors" campaign and the "eradication of three capitals," everyone has been panicking, fearing imprisonment and rice fines. Those with money fled to Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Shanghai, and other places, while intellectuals and people of reputation without money had no choice but to flee to other lands, determined to "rather starve to death outside than be slaughtered." If the government were to count the number of refugees from northern Jiangsu, the number would be considerable. Among them, many are ambitious people who are now wandering the streets, hoping that the government will pay attention and find ways to help them.

Thorough Eradication Campaign

"Thorough rent and interest reduction" and "guarantee of rent and interest payment" are policies touted by the Communist Party, but the style of the district and township political commissars and the peasant resistance committee members is baffling. Recently, they believed that the past investigation and reduction were not thorough, so they re-implemented it. The method was to reduce rent based on the number of fields owned by the landlord. If the calculation showed that the landlord still had something to gain, it would be considered "reversed rent," that is, the rent reduction would be retroactive, calculated from the time the New Fourth Army arrived in northern Jiangsu in 1940. In this way, landlords not only did not benefit but also had to borrow rent notes from the tenants, in addition to paying public grain and taxes. As a result, they could only hand over the fields to the tenants.

Self-Defense Movement

Recently, the Communist army has again expanded the militia organization in northern Jiangsu, calling it the "self-defense movement." In practice, the township cadres are concentrated for training by district. Now they have graduated and returned to work in various townships, reorganizing the strong men who were originally in the militia into district guerrilla squadrons. The original district guerrilla companies were reorganized into county guard regiments, and the original county guard regiments have now been reorganized into a certain column of the New Fourth Army and transferred to southern Shandong and then to the northeast. The current militia organization consists of strong men aged 18 to 40, regardless of whether they are only sons or the amount of property they own, all must join. Therefore, from the current situation, the eligible strong men in the countryside are all militiamen.

Relief Movement

Northern Jiangsu is the only large rice-producing area, but recently, because the Communist army transported rice from Haibei, an unprecedented famine has formed. Now the "Democratic Government" stipulates that people eat two meals a day and are not allowed to eat fish or meat, and the following three teams are formed to carry out activities:

A. "Eat-Up Team": Those who eat three meals a day or have surplus food at home are led by the township committee to gather and eat, like a flock of sparrows, until it is all gone.

B. "Smell-Fragrance Team": Upon smelling the fragrance of fish or meat, they gather at the house to eat together. They have a "Smell-Fragrance Team" dedicated to this task.

C. "Demolition Team": Recently, the Communist army has been building bunkers in various strongholds, organizing demolition teams to specialize in demolishing the property of counter-revolutionaries (puppet officials and "three capitals") houses, and demolishing a portion to the so-called base areas for the "people" to live in together.

Special Operations Organization

The intelligence and dispatch work of the Communist army is extremely meticulous. I cannot know the details, so I will briefly record the semi-public special operations organization that has recently been implemented among the people as follows:

A. "Reconnaissance Team": The people hate the Communist army to the bone for everything they do. The "Democratic Government" authorities, in order to detect "reactionary" people, organized a reconnaissance team to specialize in reconnaissance. If two people walk together on the road, the reconnaissance team will follow behind to find out what they are talking about. Restaurants and taverns also often have personnel specializing in intelligence work.

B. "Listen-to-the-Wall Team": The job of the "Listen-to-the-Wall Team" is to specifically listen to people's words and actions at home. When they think someone is suspicious, they will be arrested and taken to the official office.

Economic Activities

The only currency in northern Jiangsu now is the anti-Japanese currency. There are many types of anti-Japanese currency, including "circulating notes," "anti-Japanese notes," "old anti-Japanese," "new anti-Japanese," "Jianghuai" notes, "Huazhong" notes, etc., with dozens of types. The value of old and new anti-Japanese currency is different, which makes all the people have a headache. In the past, during the "puppet currency" period, anyone carrying puppet currency would have it confiscated, but in fact, they themselves still used it among the people. For example, a few months ago in Gaoyou, someone from a certain tax office used puppet currency, which was discovered by the people and caused a disturbance at the county government. The county magistrate, Gu Weihan, still protected them, which incited a city-wide strike. Now, legal tender is also not allowed to circulate in the market in northern Jiangsu, and private use is confiscated, but it can be exchanged for "anti-Japanese currency" at the Huazhong Bank at a rate of forty to one. The amount of legal tender received by the Huazhong Bank every day is very large. The people all ask what is the use of the "Huazhong" taking away the legal tender since it is not allowed to circulate in the market?

The burden on the people in northern Jiangsu is to pay "money and grain" and "public grain" in the countryside (now pre-collecting for the second half of the year), and merchants in towns and cities pay "business tax" and "goods transit tax." In addition, there are joint burdens such as "clothing donation," "comfort donation," "shoe donation," "quilt donation," district waiting "anti-Japanese family donation," "martyr's family donation," "honorary soldier donation," and dozens of other types.

In terms of economic policy, if the price of goods in the recovered areas rises, the "Democratic Government" increases the value of the "anti-Japanese currency," so that the price of goods in the "Liberated Area" remains unchanged when calculated in anti-Japanese currency. If the price of goods in the recovered areas is low, causing materials to flow inward, the import tax is increased, leaving merchants with no profit to be made. For example, northern Jiangsu used to have a surplus of rice, which was mostly transported to Jiangnan. Recently, because the Communist army bought and transported it, the price of rice has risen to 1,100 yuan per stone in "anti-Japanese currency," equivalent to 40,000 yuan in legal tender, while the rice in Changshu and Jiangyin in Jiangnan only costs 200 yuan per stone in "anti-Japanese currency." If it is transported from Jiangnan to northern Jiangsu for sale, an import tax of 200 yuan in "anti-Japanese currency" is added per stone, making it unprofitable. Merchants have since hesitated, and the lives of the people are even more bitter.

Merchants, in addition to not using shop assistants and engaging in small-scale sales to maintain their livelihoods, all large stores, if they continue for another three months, not only will they run out of all their goods, but the owners will also go bankrupt and liquidate. This is because the "Democratic Government" has established the Jianghai Company and the Yumin Company, which use "anti-Japanese currency" without funds to acquire large amounts of legal tender and purchase large quantities of materials from other ports, taking the upper hand. Conversely, merchants need capital, and there are heavy "anti-Japanese taxes," so the cost is high, the people are in deep water, purchasing power is weak, business is slow, and in addition, shop assistants demand salary increases, surrounded by enemies on all sides, how can they not collapse?

Inside Education

Primary and secondary education in the "Liberated Area" focuses on meeting ceremonies, promotes "democracy," and sings more than teaches. Middle school students can choose courses, and they don't have to listen to courses they don't like. If teachers interfere, it is not "democratic." The only specialized courses are New Democracy, Marxism-Leninism, and a new outlook on life. Subei Public School is run in Dongtai Dazhongji, and a branch school is set up in Shagou Dingsuo. No matter what level you are, you can go to school. You graduate in three months and are assigned to work in various basic units. In this school, in addition to providing food and lodging, even pocket money is given, so many young people are absorbed. There are usually twenty or thirty teams in the school, each team a company of more than a hundred people. In addition, excellent cadres are sent to study in major middle schools in the recovered areas, and children of the people are encouraged to study abroad and given subsidies. The purpose is worthy of consideration.

Transportation in the "Liberated Area" is intermittent. Highways are built along the base areas, and cars can pass through. Near the recovered areas, the highways are destroyed. At the border, there are checkpoints where anyone suspicious is immediately detained. The countryside is also filled with militiamen who check pedestrians anytime and anywhere. Finding legal tender is an unexpected fortune. If they are happy, they may even reward you with a meal.

Under the Democratic Government, apart from seeing the Huazhong edition of the "Xinhua Daily" and the "Jianghai Guide," I have never seen what the Shanghai newspapers look like after the victory. Letters to and from the "Liberated Area" are also subject to inspection. The personnel of the post office have now been replaced and are under the jurisdiction of the "Border Region Government."

Food Shortage in Japan

The "New York Times" recently said that since Christmas last year, Japanese officials have taken two steps to combat the food shortage: Tokyo police have cracked down on illegal food sales, resulting in the arrest of 423 people.

Recently, the Allied Headquarters refused to remove certain items from food ration cards, intending to continue controlling these foods, but it also made it clear that this did not mean that current prices should remain at their original level. This indirectly shows that the government intends to raise prices, and the government may use subsidies to prevent consumer unrest.

At the same time, Major Lyonard, chief of the Agriculture and Forestry Division of the National Resources Group of the Allied Headquarters, also announced that the rice production in the US military occupation area of ​​Korea last year (rice production accounts for 71 percent of all Korea) was 81.8 million bushels. It is estimated that Korea's demand for the year is 70.2 million bushels. This does not include the possible needs of North Korea. The Soviet side did not allow the rice production figures in the north to be revealed.

Due to the Soviet side's lack of expression on trade between the north and south, and the US's policy of controlling Japan's foreign trade, farmers in southern Korea are holding unstable feelings about the future. Therefore, the possibility of 10 million bushels of rice flowing into the export market is extremely small.

Strangely, Japanese police do not prohibit black market food sales, but they prevent the sale of non-rationed foods, such as vegetables and fish. Two hundred and fifty vegetable vendors and 173 fish vendors have been arrested for selling their produce at prices more than twice the wholesale price. The Japanese government stipulates that retail prices should not exceed 20 percent of wholesale prices. Translated by Jin Ming

### Ministry of Education Convenes Meeting to Revise Middle School Curriculum Standards: Reducing the Physical and Mental Burden of Middle School Students, Confirming the Unification of Junior High School Goals, Adjusting Teaching Outlines and Hours

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Education recently convened a Middle School Curriculum Discussion Meeting in Chongqing to revise the middle school curriculum standards. The concentrated opinions of the discussion have been summarized into several key points. Although they still need to be reviewed further for a final decision, the general direction can be known. We will briefly outline them here for the reference of those who care about education:

Purpose

The motive and purpose of revising the middle school curriculum is to reduce the physical and mental burden of middle school students and increase their learning efficiency.

Abolition

Abolishing the Grouping System: The middle school curriculum focuses on unification. This semester, English has already been changed to a required course in junior high school, which has broken the previous rule of dividing junior high school into Group A and Group B, one preparing for employment and the other preparing for further education. To confirm the unification of junior high school goals, the grouping system should be explicitly abolished. Senior high school will not be divided into groups, but from the second academic year, students will choose to study mathematics (analytic geometry), English, and Chinese according to their interests as additional courses.

Adjustment

The mathematics courses and hours for both senior and junior high schools will be adjusted separately. "In junior high school," the time for scout class will be reduced, and extracurricular time will be increased. The geology and mineralogy in the natural history curriculum will be changed and merged into natural geography teaching. Work will focus on practical skills. History and geography will be taught separately and centrally in principle. "In senior high school," home economics and nursing will replace work courses for girls. The mineralogy course is in preparation for cultivating geology and mineralogy talents. Music will be listed as an extracurricular activity from the second grade. History and geography will be taught separately and centrally. English will be a required course for all. Senior high school should focus on reading comprehension training, and junior high school should start with listening and speaking training, gradually entering writing training. The total weekly teaching hours for senior and junior high schools will be reduced by eliminating or reducing the repeating course hours, so the number of hours will be less than before the war.

### Teachers of Private Schools in This City Petition: Satisfactory Result

Municipal Council Approves Subsidy of 200 Million Yuan

[Report from this city] Teachers of private primary and secondary schools, in order to promote education and improve treatment, petitioned the Municipal Education Bureau through two groups, including the Primary School Joint In-Service Training Association. After making three requests, they went to the Education Bureau again yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm to request instructions. Director Zhi personally answered the three points: (1) The subsidy for private schools is 80,000 yuan per person, which will be issued at the same time as the second phase of subsidies for municipal schools. (2) Yesterday's municipal meeting approved the allocation of 200 million yuan in subsidies to private schools, but this amount is not enough to meet the standard of 80,000 yuan per person mentioned in the first point. It is approved to transfer a part of it from the Teacher Respect Movement Subsidy Fund. It is reported that the Municipal Education Bureau originally planned to give 54 million yuan in two phases in February and May, evenly distributed. The February portion has been issued as scheduled. When the May portion is issued, it will be made up to 200 million yuan. (3) A notice was issued to all schools to issue the fees collected for the second time to the teachers and staff at once, and the amount shall not be lower than 80% of the total income. Those who violate this shall be reported and severely punished. It was also announced that the relief supplies approved by the General Relief Association would include one bag of flour and five pounds of milk powder for each teacher and staff member. Finally, the current difficulties of the education cause and national finances were described, hoping that all colleagues in the education community would work together to overcome the difficulties and work hard in their positions.

### Under Strict Government Supervision, Rice Prices Rise Sharply; Flour and Miscellaneous Grains Also Increase; Market Situation is Quite Chaotic

Yesterday, the rice market saw producers' prices increase gradually, bolstering market confidence. Retail sales improved. Despite strict government supervision, both japonica and indica rice varieties, as well as yuan rice, uniformly rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Chaozhou flour merchants continued to acquire supplies off-market, driving prices up by around 2,000 yuan. The same was true for soybeans, which increased by over 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were also brisk, with prices jumping by 1,000 yuan. Bran also saw strong demand, surging by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts followed suit, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Edible oil retail prices continued their upward trajectory, soaring by anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The market has become chaotic, with prices rising across the board. The future is difficult to predict. According to rice market sources, yesterday's city arrivals included six types of rice, totaling over 5,000 dan. The types and quantities are as follows: White japonica 1,791 dan, Du indica 627 dan, Yangqiu 437 dan, Early rice 1,180 dan, Thin rice 1,079 dan, White yuan 146 dan.

### Gold Prices Continue to Decline

Refined gold futures opened flat yesterday morning, but struggled to maintain that level, falling below 1.56 million. The US dollar recovered from a weak opening, stimulating the gold market. Prices briefly rebounded slightly, reaching 1.585 million. However, buyers were constrained by the Central Bank's controlled price, and buying interest soon waned. At noon, prices hovered around 1.57 million. The afternoon remained stable, with the final price slightly lower than the previous day's close, decreasing by ten thousand. Jewelry gold sold for 168,000, silver remained unchanged, and silver dollars also remained the same. Black market discounts ranged from 12% to 16%.

### Continuous Settlements Boost the US Dollar

Yesterday, supply and demand for the US dollar were somewhat volatile. Although physical currency was being released, retail demand had not yet subsided. Some foreign firms, anticipating a further surge in imports next month, were cautiously buying on dips. The dollar recovered from an initial weakness, opening at 2,310 yuan and soon falling to below 2,270 yuan. Continuous settlements depleted reserves, and the dollar briefly rose again to over 2,330 yuan. At noon, the dollar hovered around 2,310 yuan. The afternoon market was expected to remain volatile. The final price was slightly lower than the previous day's close. Hong Kong dollars fluctuated with the exchange rate, ending with old banknotes up 5 yuan and new banknotes up 8 yuan. Rupees were at 520 yuan and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers at 420 yuan, both showing slight gains. Official US dollar exchange rates remained unchanged.

### Increased Sales by Peers Ease Yarn Market Surge

The surge in the yarn market subsided yesterday. The continued rise of middle and smaller yarn dealers for several days prompted peers to sell their holdings. Additionally, Shuangma yarn's attempt to increase prices lacked strength, leading to a decrease of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan for various brands of 20-count yarn. Market confidence remained stable. It was reported that off-market trading increased again in the afternoon. At noon, the Spinning and Weaving Company, as usual, announced a bidding range, with 10-count to 42-count yarn priced 20,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the previous period. The remaining prices were similar. Additionally, there were ten types of yarn, ranging from two to fifty-one lots each, which were still sold through a bidding process. It was reported that seven of these lots were won by yarn firms such as Juncheng, Hongda, and Changtong Taichang. The bidding prices were comparable to the market prices.

### Progress in Spot Cotton Trading

Yesterday, New York American cotton telecommunications showed the market to be strong in the near term and weak in the long term. The near-term price was US$27.85, and the long-term price was US$28.00. Mid-term spot prices were not announced. Spot cotton trading progressed in the local market, with private enterprises such as Shenxin No. 16 Factory being the main buyers. Intra-industry trading was also brisk. The delivery price to the factory for mid-term cotton has risen to 88,000 yuan, an increase of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan in recent days. The Spinning and Weaving Company was not heard to be purchasing.

### Tea Market Declines Further

Late spring and early summer are typically the peak season for tea sales as new harvests arrive. However, recent transactions have been steadily declining, with prices falling without rebound. This is due to poor absorption by local tea shops, sluggish purchasing by out-of-town buyers, and continued inactivity from foreign firms. As a result, some owners have experienced cash flow problems and have collectively resorted to selling their goods. The market is now facing oversupply, and restoring market confidence is proving difficult. The outlook suggests a continuation of the current downward trend.

### Surge in Coking Coal Arrivals Causes White Coal to Plunge

Coking coal is essential for steelmaking and can also be used for cooking fuel. With the city facing a fuel shortage, local merchants planned to purchase large quantities of coking coal from Tianjin, Bengbu, and Xuzhou to prepare for sales at high prices. However, transportation disruptions prevented timely shipments. Only recently have arrivals increased. With increased coal deliveries in Shanghai, sales of coking coal have been significantly affected. Current stockpiles exceed 10,000 tons, with Jingxing coking coal being the most abundant, followed by Kaiping coal, and Zhongxing coal being the least. The recent decline in white coal prices is primarily due to the abundance of coking coal arrivals.

The Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been shipping large quantities of Kailuan coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai, totaling several thousand tons. In addition, the freighter "Haijia" has arrived with 6,000 tons of coal, and the "Pivo," carrying 10,000 tons of Keelung coal from Taiwan, is docked at Huangpu Wharf, unloading its cargo. Furthermore, large shipments of coal are expected to arrive from Vietnam shortly. Shanghai's coal needs will not be lacking.

### Peppermint Oil: High Demand in the US

[Reuters, New York, 26th] Buyers this month are showing little interest in Chinese cinnamon and anise oil due to expectations of further price declines. However, peppermint oil is in high demand due to limited supply. The menthol market is reportedly quiet.

### Guerrilla-Style Performance: Government Bonds Reach New Highs; Stock Market Waits for Turnaround

Government bonds continue their mysterious path, trading under police scrutiny. Buyers are pushing forward. Despite one bank on Sijing Road unloading over one million, individual investors and large bond market players are able to absorb the supply. B-type bonds opened low but closed high, creating a lively performance and reaching a new high of 6,900 yuan. Buying sentiment remains strong, with prices surging by 850 yuan. Other bonds also increased by 650 to 1,000 yuan. Most large stock traders have ceased trading, while some have relocated. Activity is limited due to the lack of transparency, resulting in a quiet and sparse market. Stock prices experienced small fluctuations. Traders are awaiting the outcome of negotiations and remain cautious. However, rumors of improved conditions next week have shifted sentiment. Afternoon trading saw increased bids, and off-market trading of foreign stocks became slightly more active, with strong buying interest. In anticipation of a return to normalcy, prices rebounded slightly from the previous day.

### Silk Prices Rise Steadily

Yesterday, artificial silk prices rose due to strong demand from northern buyers. 120-count Huoqiao brand opened at 1.5 million yuan, steadily rising to close at 1.59 million yuan. Afternoon prices increased further, reaching 1.62 million yuan, an increase of 110,000 yuan from the previous day. 120-count miscellaneous brands of semi-gloss silk saw limited demand, resulting in a small decrease of 20,000 yuan. There were no transactions for high-quality, evenness factory silk. Both high-quality and ordinary silk increased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Yesterday, ordinary high-quality silk was priced at 1.7 million yuan, an increase of approximately 100,000 yuan from the previous two days. Fabric prices also increased, with Meiya quilt covers trading at 1.17 million yuan in the morning. Dachen checkered crepe continues to advance, with each yard priced at 4,140 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan from the previous day. Second-date tickets were being sold at 180 yuan. Sheng and Hangzhou goods also reported price increases.

### Sugar Prices Fluctuate Greatly

Yesterday, sugar prices experienced significant fluctuations, with a focus on medium-grade white sugar. The guild initially set the price at 63,000 yuan in the morning, then increased it to 65,000-66,000 yuan before retracting to 63,000 yuan. Afternoon trading remained tight, rising again to 65,000-66,000 yuan. No sellers were available even at 66,000 yuan. Several dozen bags of low-grade Qing sugar were offered at 51,500 yuan.

### Arrival of Taiwanese Sugar Expected to Lower Prices

According to sources in the sugar industry, the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal's sugar inventory, which had been entrusted to the guild for fair and wholesale sales since December of last year, has been completely sold. This was effective in suppressing sugar prices at the end of the lunar year. Subsequently, 4,000 metric tons of sugar shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai were also entrusted to the guild for wholesale sales, with prices consistently around 50,000 yuan. Compared to the sharp price increases of other commodities in recent months, sugar prices have remained relatively stable. Recent price increases are attributed to increased demand exceeding supply due to improved transportation and increased purchasing by customers from various regions. Destinations for these sugar sales, transported by sea, range from Xi'an to Lanzhou, and, transported by the Yangtze River, from Shanghai to Yichang. Therefore, current price increases are considered a temporary trend. It is now reported that 3,000 metric tons of Taiwanese sugar will arrive in Shanghai soon. This sugar will be supplied to the market and is expected to lower sugar prices.

### Caustic Soda Prices Rise

Caustic soda prices increased slightly compared to the previous day because arriving shipments had not yet been unloaded and there was some retail purchasing activity. Yesterday, a foreign merchant received a telegram from Manila stating that exports from that location were definitely prohibited, and remaining inventories were dwindling, with the current price at over US$140 per barrel, excluding shipping costs.

### Objections to Tea Loan Allocation

Tea industry loans totaling 700,000 yuan have been approved by the authorities. Of this amount, 220,000 yuan is allocated to the Pingshui district and is being handled by the China Farmers Bank. The bank has sent letters to the guarantors, requiring them to complete detailed forms and sign agreements within three days. However, tea merchants generally disagree with the allocated loan amounts. It is reported that they will request the authorities to reconsider the matter.

### Public Bus Loan

Totaling 400 Million Yuan to Purchase 50 Buses

The Shanghai Public Utility Bureau, to develop municipal transportation, previously established a preparatory office for the Shanghai Public Bus Company, beginning to restore old lines and procure new vehicles. It repaired and refurbished the already received older vehicles, totaling 50 buses, to serve the city divided across three routes. However, reliance on only dozens of these dilapidated vehicles has proved insufficient to meet demand. The bureau has requested a loan of 400 million yuan from the Joint Savings Society, planning to purchase 50 new vehicles. The bureau has notified the British Shanghai Electric Construction Company to restore all existing lines by the end of June of this year. Otherwise, the contract previously made with the Shanghai Municipal Council will be voided.

### Prices on Bandit Islands

Five and a Half Times Higher Than Before the War

[United Press, Manila, 25th] According to government statistics, the cost of living in the Philippines gradually decreased after liberation, but has been rising again since the beginning of March. The main reason is the shortage of rice, with prices rising by 25% between March 6th and April 2nd. As of the 10th of this month, the cost of living index was 548% higher than before the war.

### North China Securities Exchange Ordered to Close; Must Be Liquidated Before Further Arrangements

The Tianjin North China Securities Exchange was ordered by the municipal government to close on the 22nd of this month. The exchange was the only speculative market in Tianjin, established during the enemy occupation period. It was initiated by the Chambers of Commerce, Banks, and Money Houses of Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan. It officially opened on August 27, 1945. The exchange's operations involved brokers trading with each other within the exchange. The listed securities totaled 26, but daily trading was mainly focused on Qixin, Luan Mining, East Asia, Jian, and Jiangnan, with only a few miscellaneous stocks. On November 3 of last year, Zhang Guowei, the Special Finance and Economic Commissioner of the Finance Ministry residing in the Jilu Chahar District, appointed Liu Jingyuan as the receiving commissioner. Because the exchange was one of Tianjin's important financial institutions, all operations were permitted to continue as usual in the interest of stabilizing the market, until now. The current closure and liquidation is being supervised by the Bureau of Social Affairs in accordance with the Finance Ministry's regulations on the liquidation of commercial and financial institutions in recovered areas. Whether the exchange can reopen in the future will depend on the Finance Ministry's review and decision after the liquidation. After the exchange closed, the Securities Dealers Association held a meeting to discuss countermeasures, but no specific decision was made.

### Commercial Summary

Longan: Buyers actively stocked up, tightening the market and driving up prices. Yesterday, over 600 baskets of large-bubble Longan were offered at 60,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan.

Northern Goods: Negotiation between sales and buyers has not settled; transaction is deficient. Black melon seeds from Huaizhongzhuang were sold for 71,200 yuan.

Cigarettes: Qianmen and British American Tobacco experienced oversupply, driving prices down. Lao Dao and Xiannv benefited from a lack of Shanghai-produced cigarettes, leading Chinese merchants' brands to gain favor and prices to increase.

Western Medicine: Bottled quinine was priced at the Great Wan Customs, and canned quinine was priced around 50,000. With steady deliveries of raw materials for western medicine, locally produced products have generally softened in price.

Paper Rolls: There are reports of large imports of American paper rolls on the Great Lai Shipping Company's Wawali Da ship in early next month, leading to concerns about potential price declines.

Hardware: 5- and 6-cent iron nails and pipes experienced sluggish sales and slight price decreases. Lacquer and purple copper pipes saw manufacturer demand, leading to a slight price increase. Three-Star saw blades also increased slightly; the remainder remained unchanged.

Leather: Raw cattle and sheep hides have recently seen some imports from outer ports, resulting in softer prices. Yellow cowhide has also declined slightly, while the remainder remained stable.

Bristles: Market conditions remained quiet. It is reported that the price of the 17th type was only US$2.50 per pound in foreign markets. If domestic prices are based on this foreign market price, it will be difficult for domestic prices to improve.

### US Radio Production to Break Records This Year

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] According to the Federal Communications Commission: US radio production in 1946 is estimated to reach a record high of 21 million units, over 7 million units more than the record production volume in 1941. According to manufacturers' plans, approximately 1.8 million of these 21 million radios will be AM radios.

### First Batch of Chinese Medicine Arrives in the US; Export Tax Considered Too High

The first batch of over 100 packages of Chinese medicine sent by air by Chongqing Zhongning Company has arrived in the United States. According to the company's San Francisco telegram, the local overseas Chinese and allied friends are quite interested and hope that our country will ship large quantities. The company will strive for the Chinese medicine market in the United States, and will establish a large-scale pharmaceutical factory in Chongqing, specializing in the production of various Chinese medicines, packaged in boxes, and shipped to the United States. However, the current export tax is too high, and there are many transportation difficulties, making it difficult to promote export trade.

### Economic Briefs

The second phase of grain loans will be considered after the first phase of purchased rice arrives in Shanghai, but there is no intention to stop them. In the future, the scope of loans can be broadened to include more than the original seventeen lenders. The amount of loans will be determined based on actual needs.

It is reported that in order to develop its business and facilitate capital turnover, the China Textile Company has borrowed one million US dollars from the Bank of America.

The Shanghai Clearing House has approved the application of the Shanghai branch of Bazhou Bank to be included as an agent bank for clearing.

According to securities industry sources, there are more than 400 firms in Shanghai, employing over 80,000 people, all of whom are currently suspended and unemployed. Representatives will be sent to petition Finance Minister Yu, requesting permission to resume trading securities and stocks to make a living before the "Stock Exchange" officially reopens.

The Shanghai branch of the China National Industry Association has received participation from over 200 organizations since it began soliciting members. The deadline has been set for the 15th of next month, and a founding general assembly is planned for the end of May.

### The Publication Plan for the Complete Works of Shakespeare

— Cao Weifeng

Mr. Cao Weifeng's publication plan for the Complete Works of Shakespeare can be said to be a bold attempt by the Chinese publishing industry after the victory. Seeing the distortion and depression of today's publishing industry, we are very willing to see the success of this meaningful work. – Editor

After much consideration, I have finally decided to allow the first ten volumes of the Complete Works of Shakespeare to meet the readers of Shanghai.

I made this decision for several reasons:

(1) I have been working on this for fifteen years, starting in the spring of the September 18th Incident. During this long and difficult—truly difficult—time, I have always been working on this alone, in silence. Although there was sympathy, there was not much encouragement, but I suffered enough ridicule and indifference. According to my own intention, I wanted to make it perfect before printing it, but this could not be done; because life is rarely stable, reference books—those who study literature know that it is impossible to do this without reference books—those that I had have been lost, and there is no way to buy those that I don't have. If I could improve my life in the foreseeable future and concentrate on this work, then I would not be in a hurry to publish this part first, but this is hopeless. Therefore, I originally hoped to write a more detailed preface for each volume, add more annotations, add a few more illustrations, and improve and correct some of the problems that I knew existed, but none of these could be done. I can only let them meet the readers naked. Because if I don't publish it at this time, I may have to wait another ten or eight years, and the situation will still not improve.

(2) When I was in the interior, Wentong Bookstore in Guiyang published ten volumes. This is a good bookstore, and the owner's intentions were very good. I also have special reasons to miss it—the time I lived on Huajia Mountain outside Guiyang City that year is particularly worth remembering—but due to the ability of the workers and proofreaders, all ten volumes were riddled with errors. I am willing to revise my own manuscripts five or ten times—Hamlet alone has been revised more than five times—but I dare not look at the printed ones at all. Recently, in order to have them printed in Shanghai, I took them out to read, and some places were so wrong that I blushed with shame. This made me even more determined to rush to typeset them, and I also decided to be the final proofreader myself.

(3) It seems that we have not had this kind of publication for a long time. The so-called Shanghai style in the past is now even more "Shanghai"; the so-called Beijing style in the past, no publisher dares to try. Most of the published books are thin volumes, and even if there is a good book, it is not easy to sell three or five thousand copies; the life of a publishing house is sometimes shorter than the life of sales. Therefore, most of the time when a new book is published, it is with the determination to lose money, although because of interest, many people are willing to lose money regardless—these people are most worthy of our respect. The Chinese cultural and publishing circles should not always be so weak and delicate, with demons rampant.

The Complete Works of Shakespeare should have a total of forty volumes, and the first ten volumes are now being printed; the second ten volumes should be available soon, as for the third and fourth ten volumes, I am afraid it will still take a while.

This attempt is probably the first such attempt in the Chinese publishing industry after the victory. This matter is bound to fail commercially, but if broad sympathy can assist it, it may succeed. In that case, our publishing industry may embark on a new path.

### Introducing Books on Constitutionalism

— Lin Gu

Edited by Pan Gongzhan, published by Zhengzhong Bookstore

The basic spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution does not lie in inheriting the old rules and systems of representative politics, but especially in transforming and innovating the old rules and systems of representative politics. The ultimate goal of the Kuomintang's fifty years of effort is to establish the democratic constitutionalism of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals and return political power to the people. As for the steps and guidelines for its implementation, they are fully reflected in the Founding Program personally formulated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The Founding Program starts with removing obstacles and aims at completing construction, the so-called three periods of military government, tutelage, and constitutionalism. This is the procedure for China to implement a democratic political system. Indeed, due to the remaining poison of the imperial system for thousands of years, most people lack both political awareness and experience. It is inevitable that if they are suddenly given political power, it will be seized by the powerful. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen was alive, recalling the past, he often attributed the rampant poison of military閥劫持 to the fact that party members in the early years of the Republic of China did not follow the tutelage procedures, so he held the firmest view of the revolutionary strategy he had set. The historical mission of the Kuomintang lies in establishing the Republic of China, but its central task is to be responsible for tutelage in order to train the people to have sufficient ability and practical experience to effectively apply ordinary administrative civil rights, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of past constitutional failures.

After the Kuomintang completed the military government period and established the tutelage system, it began to prepare for the implementation of constitutionalism. The so-called May 5th Draft Constitution took three years and seven drafts to complete. The May 5th Draft Constitution is an unofficial draft that must be discussed and decided by the National Assembly to become a true constitution. The National Assembly was repeatedly planned to be convened before the war and during the War of Resistance, but in fact the difficulty of convening the assembly could not be overcome by wishes alone. Recently, it was originally scheduled to be convened on May 5th, but due to factual difficulties, the government has temporarily postponed it again.

The National Assembly is the key to ending tutelage and starting constitutionalism. The political power exercised by the Kuomintang in accordance with the law of the tutelage period formulated by the National Assembly must be transferred to the National Assembly in accordance with the constitution promulgated by the National Assembly. The government has the greatest sincerity to convene the National Assembly and return political power to the people, and the people have the eager expectation to convene the National Assembly and implement constitutionalism. The so-called return of political power to the people must be entrusted through the institution of the National Assembly.

Now, the National Assembly is about to be convened, and its task is to formulate the fundamental law of the constitutional period. In recent years, there have been many books discussing this issue, but the one that can truly expound the principles and systems of democratic politics of the Three Principles of the People is the Constitutionalism Series edited by Pan Gongzhan and published by Zhengzhong Bookstore. The Constitutionalism Series is a set of twelve volumes, written by those who have been engaged in drafting the May 5th Draft Constitution or who have specialized in constitutional studies. Each volume has been personally proofread by Mr. Pan. These twelve books have discussed all aspects of constitutionalism. The titles of the books are as follows: Chen Changheng: The Essence of the Five-Power Constitution Draft, Hu Jingming: The Five-Power Constitution and the Constitutions of Various Countries, Zhang Yuanruo: The Rights and Obligations of the People, Cui Shuqin: Populist Politics and Parliamentary Politics, Yang Youjiong: Division of Powers and Equalization of Powers System, Li Zonghuang: Constitutionalism and Local Autonomy, Yang Dongwen: Constitutionalism and National Defense, Wu Qiyuan: Constitutionalism and Economy, Cheng Tianfang: Constitution and Education, Chen Nianzhong: County-Level People's Opinion Organs, Wang Guanqing: A Brief History of the Chinese Constitutional Movement, Pan Gongzhan: Common Words on Constitutionalism. The first ten volumes have already been published in Chongqing, and only a part has been printed in Shanghai.

In addition, regarding books on constitutionalism, the bureau also has the Legislative Yuan's Explanation of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China, Liu Jingwen's Principles of Chinese Constitutionalism, and other books, the content of which is also very valuable.

### The Neglected Book Famine

— Li Sheng

Although the Shanghai publishing industry has felt a resurgence after the victory of the War of Resistance, it has not yet recovered to the level of readers' needs. Loyal readers still feel depressed!

For example, books and magazines on medicine related to human life are really scarce. It is difficult to find one or two in each newspaper, and even those that have published one or two issues in the past have mostly disappeared without a sound. Also, comprehensive and meaningful monthly magazines are becoming less and less!

But on the other hand, the so-called "small weekly magazines" are numerous and becoming more and more popular. Their content is mostly worthless and corrupts morals, and their harm is no less than that of comic books for elementary school students! They are only suitable for those with rudimentary knowledge.

Academic medical books and magazines are decreasing day by day, and many students in schools do not have textbooks to attend classes. This is not a glorious thing from the perspective of the entire publishing industry, society, and country.

The root cause is nothing more than expensive paper and expensive labor and materials. Academic books and magazines are not easy to make money, while small weekly magazines are easy to handle and do not lead to losses. But this is a short-sighted view! Meaningful books, newspapers, and magazines, although they cannot be popular for a while, are like deeply rooted trees that will not fall suddenly. As long as they are well cultivated, why worry that the number of readers will not increase day by day? And small weekly magazines and speculative publications, even if the authorities do not ban them, will be rejected by readers because they are all the same "colorless" stories.

I hope that the publishing industry will automatically correct the book famine and seek happiness for itself and others, and not run counter to national policy. Because the publishing industry is different from other businesses, it is a mediator between the foreknowledge and afterknowledge.

### Words from Writers

— Liang Gong

A great writer is one who writes about the anxieties of the times and creates the light of the times. – Lu Xun

The reason why a writer and poet falls behind is that he has broken away from the struggle. – Kosarev

A writer should be as unencumbered by worldly affairs as a clergyman. – Emerson

The clumsiness of a writer is the mouthpiece of the soul. – Cervantes

My articles are not on the surface, but in the soul. Only a lofty soul can have great thoughts... A great and respectable writer is not one who uses writing as a means of earning a living. People who only seek to make money naturally have base thoughts. – Rousseau

### "Small Weekly Magazines and Social Atmosphere"

— Xiao Cai

Mr. Li Sheng's article "Small Weekly Magazines and Social Atmosphere," published in the Shenbao publishing section on April 6, discussed the fact that the current small weekly magazines in this city are harmful to morals and should be banned. It is a truly insightful and gratifying argument.

In the present moment, after eight years of bloody resistance and victory, with national reconstruction waiting to be carried out, we dare not say how important the responsibilities of the general publishing industry are, or what kind of responsibilities they should bear. However, publications that are closely related to culture and education can directly affect the minds and bodies of young people and indirectly shift the social atmosphere. Their significance for the future of the country and the nation is no less than that of school education. The serious and proper attitude that the general publishing industry should take in the great era at the beginning of national reconstruction is self-evident. We will not discuss the motives of the editors and publishers of these small publications, but the negative and serious consequences of their influence, such as poisoning the minds of young people, leading them astray, and the resulting deterioration of social atmosphere and order, are undeniable facts. And those who like to read these low-taste publications are mostly middle school youths and general vocational youths such as shop assistants, craftsmen, and laborers. The former are the backbone of future society, and the future of the country and the nation depends on them. The latter are the grassroots workers who make up a considerable number in the city, and their impact on social order is very large.

Mr. Li Sheng's article said that due to the "Stroblemann" case, the sales of Parisian tabloids reached as many as 500,000 copies, and its influence caused the number of crimes in Belgium and Italy to increase as a result. Although this example cannot be completely determined as a consequence caused by news reports, deliberately promoting and exaggerating certain improper news, such as obscenity and theft, is not only unhelpful to young people and society, but also invisibly gives young people a very bad hint and leads them astray.

I remember that someone once criticized old-style comic books as inappropriate reading material for the masses, precisely because their content either had a negative, decadent, and depraved attitude towards life, or violated patriotic ideas, or encouraged obscenity and theft. However, there are still many excellent and proper stories, such as love for the country and loyalty to the emperor, respect for teachers and filial piety, and some of them are not necessarily worse than the currently popular small publications in Shanghai. Since those old-style folk publications are on the list of bans, these harmful and useless small publications should be banned even more in the current time of material hardship and national reconstruction.

As a result of the eight-year War of Resistance, the social order in the recovered areas is chaotic and people are uneasy. Under the high pressure of the enemy and puppets in Shanghai, the people's mental suffering and life suppression urgently need the revelation and leadership of a proper and healthy life ideology and attitude, and the encouragement and guidance of a spirit that leads to active national reconstruction, so that this important metropolis of China can exert its due strength under the leadership of the government. The responsibility of this spiritual food that leads the thoughts and spirit of the Shanghai people and inspires the wisdom and strength of the Shanghai people is conceivable. For the sake of Shanghai's future, and even more for the sake of the Shanghai people's future, I hope that the authorities will thoroughly ban those publications that encourage obscenity and theft and promote positive and active spiritual education for the people.

### Writers' Enlightenment

— Xiaoshan

A writer is able to gain our love and concern because he reveals his soul to us. – Tolstoy

A work is built on the author's deepest sincerity. If you use your work to deceive people, then the first person to be deceived is the author himself. – Gorky

It took me many years of effort, hard work, and research to use a simple method. Now I can tell my friends—those who are holding pens: the highest art is "sweat"! To write a clean and beautiful sentence, you must concentrate your power intensely and then radiate it from the tip of your pen. – Duncan

Everything I create is, to me, like a poet has something sprouting in the depths of his heart, so there is the sparkle of flame, the burning of life. – Ibsen

My poems may not be enough to explain me, but I am the explanation of the poems. – Shelley

Anyone who explores the depths of their own heart and faithfully writes down what they see will gain a great many readers. – Hervé

What is written, as long as it originates from a pure heart, even if it is ugly, is still a seed of life! – Davis

Of all writing, I only love writing with blood. – Nietzsche
