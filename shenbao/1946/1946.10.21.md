### Representatives From All Sides Left Shanghai This Morning; Peace Talks Move to Nanjing to Continue; President Sun Exchanges Opinions After Luncheon

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the representatives from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Third Force were all preparing to go to Nanjing, and were scheduled to gather at Longhua Airport at 8:30 this morning. CCP spokesperson Chen Jiakang made a statement saying: "Since the government occupied Zhangjiakou on the 11th and simultaneously announced the convening of the National Assembly, the door to peace negotiations has been closed, and the danger of a complete breakdown is imminent. At this time, the task of saving China still needs to be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. Apart from the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, representatives from various parties and non-partisan figures, with the spirit of 'treating a dead horse as if it were alive,' are appealing and running around for democracy and peace, with compassion and empathy, which is truly touching and admirable. This is why the negotiations have been reopened. Because of this, the informal discussions held in Shanghai in the past two days were limited to exchanging opinions and identifying problems, and therefore no conclusions were reached. Now, for the sake of practical convenience, it is decided to move these negotiations to Nanjing on the 21st. The Chinese Communist Party is saving China, which is on the verge of division, as if saving a critically ill mother. If there is a glimmer of hope, we will do our best. However, the key to success or failure still lies in the hands of the government. The CCP is willing to follow the representatives of various parties, social leaders, and the people of the whole country in making concerted efforts to strive for it."

Those going to Nanjing from the CCP side include Mr. Zhou Enlai and eight staff members; representatives from the Third Force include Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yang Yongjun, Yu Jiaju, and Li Huang from the Youth Party; Zhang Junmai, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, and Jiang Yuntian from the Democratic League; and social leaders Hu Zhengzhi and Guo Moruo.

Yesterday, reporters interviewed several representatives separately. Their combined opinions are as follows: (1) In any case, "talking" is better than "not talking"; (2) Although there is a distance between the opinions of the two sides, there is still a possibility of rapprochement; (3) Some representatives are quite concerned about the development of the Beiping Military Conference, believing that it may affect the prospects for a ceasefire; (4) This meeting is bound to be the most important of all previous negotiations, and we are willing to do our best to make it a success.

[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Zhang Shou, Secretary of the Central Party Headquarters, who is responsible for taking care of the CCP and Third Force representatives' trip to Nanjing, has already flown back to Shanghai yesterday. According to reports, he has chartered a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. The CCP representatives had contacted Marshal Ma yesterday to send a plane to Shanghai to take them to Nanjing, but it had not arrived as of last night. If the plane sent by Marshal Ma arrives in Shanghai before 8:00 this morning, the CCP representatives will take off from Jiangwan Airport; otherwise, they will take the CNAC plane to Nanjing with the Third Force representatives.

[Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Wu Tiecheng and Shao Lizi, representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) government, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 8:30 a.m. on the 20th. The two were ordered on the 17th to go to Shanghai to urge representatives of various parties to come to Nanjing to participate in the consultations. After contacting and working hard in Shanghai, good news reached the capital yesterday afternoon, and people from all walks of life have placed boundless hopes on it. This morning, reporters rushed to Xiaguan before 7:00 to greet them. The train was delayed for about an hour due to some reasons. At 8:30, as soon as the train arrived at the station, reporters boarded the last special car and met with the hardworking Wu and Shao. Shao, dressed in a long robe and mandarin jacket, looked tired. He first said to Lei Zhen, the Secretary-General of the PCC, and the reporters who came to greet him, "Thank you for waiting so long." When reporters asked how he slept on the train, Shao replied, "One quilt was too cold, and two quilts were too hot. I didn't sleep well." But when the topic of peace talks was mentioned, both of them expressed great joy. Wu immediately made the following statement to reporters next to the carriage: "The representatives of various parties and social leaders and PCC representatives who stayed in Shanghai will take a special plane back to Nanjing on the morning of the 21st to discuss everything. As for the meeting format, it will naturally follow the informal five-person small group meeting, the military three-person small group meeting, the constitutional draft review committee, and the PCC comprehensive group. However, people from the Third Force still suggest exchanging more opinions outside the meeting to help the meeting proceed."

### Wu and Shao Report on the Situation in Shanghai; President Chiang Expresses Gratification; Also Instructs Representatives to Welcome on Behalf of the Government

They then got off the train and returned to their residences at 8:45 a.m. After a short rest, they went to see the President at 9:00 a.m. to report on the negotiations in Shanghai. The President was very pleased after listening to the report, and instructed the two to welcome the representatives coming to Nanjing on behalf of the government. At nearly 10:00 a.m., the two rushed back to Wu's private residence and met with reporters. At 11:00 a.m., they went to Sun Ke's residence to report everything to the PCC government representatives. Wang Shijie, Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, Chen Lifu, and others arrived. In the evening, reporters visited Shao again. Shao said with a more pleasant expression that their trip to Shanghai was to invite representatives from all sides to return to Nanjing to break the deadlock in the negotiations. Now that this mission has been accomplished, the representatives will come to Nanjing on the 21st to continue the peace talks. However, the future cannot be said to be without difficulties. He still hopes that all parties can respect the national interest and sacrifice their personal prejudices to achieve the goal of true peace and unity, and hopes that everyone will work together. When reporters asked if the three-person meeting and the five-person meeting could be held on the 21st, Shao said that on the 21st, they would first exchange opinions informally outside the meeting. At noon, Sun Ke will host a banquet at the Lixingshe, inviting dozens of PCC representatives from Shanghai and Nanjing, and after the meal, they will conduct out-of-session discussions and may pay a visit to the President.

### Situ Meitang Calls for Peace

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Situ Meitang, chairman of the Minzhi Party, issued his views on the current situation today, calling for peace. He expressed his deep joy at the representatives of various parties coming to Nanjing to resume negotiations, believing that a bright future is in sight. Although there may be different political views among them, they must not resort to force, but should resolve conflicts invisibly through mediation. They should be open and honest and abandon prejudices, and should not use negotiations as a means of delay or meetings as a decoration for peace. He believes that the government will definitely adopt a lenient and tolerant attitude towards the Communists in the future peace talks, and the Communists will also give up force and work together hand in hand.

### Zhangjiakou Provisional Political Council to Maintain General Administration

Thousands of Communist Party Members Surrender

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 19th] The Zhangjiakou Provisional Political Affairs Committee, organized by the 11th War Zone and headed by Zhou Jun, Deputy Director of the Political Department, is responsible for maintaining general administration. Under it is the Military-Civilian Cooperation Council, which is an organization for the National Army to connect with the people. The Provisional Political Affairs Committee is divided into four groups, responsible for general affairs, personnel, foreign affairs, propaganda, culture, Baojia (household registration system), civil affairs, public training, materials and economy, and reception and custody. According to Zhou, the Political Affairs Committee has done the following: (1) Pacifying the people and protecting foreigners. There are currently 108 Soviet nationals. Commander Fu issued 2 million legal currency and 50 bags of flour. There are 4 Norwegians, 1 Belgian (a Catholic priest), and 1 Finn. Each person was issued 20,000 legal currency and every two people one bag of flour. (2) "Border currency" is no longer used. Because the Communist Army issued an additional 1,000-yuan note when they retreated, disrupting the financial system. After entering the city, the people stopped using it on their own. Before the government issued instructions, it had temporarily lent 20 million legal currency to the Chamber of Commerce and printed 5 million small notes. (3) Alleviating the hatred among the people caused by the Communist Army. (4) Rewarding people for collecting guns, selling each one for 100,000 yuan. More than 100 guns have been recovered.

The Communist Army mobilized its main force to attack the People's Self-Defense Force fiercely, and the people suffered heavy casualties. The strongest force of the Communist Army in Shandong is still the troops under Xu Shiyou in the Jiaodong Military Region, who may launch battles at any time. The troops under Wang Jian'an in the Central Shandong Military Region have suffered the heaviest losses in combat and are being replenished and trained. Including those who withdrew from northern Jiangsu, there are currently about 300,000 Communist troops in Shandong.

### No Science, No National Defense; President Chiang's Two-Point Instruction to the Academia Sinica Council; Hope to Catch Up and Keep Pace with All Countries

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] At the opening of the Academia Sinica Council, President Chiang specially issued the following full text of his instruction: During the War of Resistance, the Academia Sinica held its Second Session of the Second Council, which has been two years ago. The progress of world academics has never stopped, and the need for national defense construction is even more urgent. The Academia Sinica is convening the Third Council at this time of victory and return to the capital, which has profound significance. I would like to tell the gentlemen present here two things: Since the beginning of the War of Resistance in the 26th year (1937), the Academia Sinica moved west with the government and experienced hardship and difficulty. The people in the Academia Sinica were able to cultivate their ambitions and work diligently. The council was also re-elected once and held two meetings, which promoted all business and made important suggestions to the government. Their steadfastness and loyalty are worthy of emulation, and I should express my appreciation to you for this. I always show the Chinese people the meaning of "No Science, No National Defense." In view of the reasons for the victory or defeat of this World War, the importance of scientific research can be further proved. As the only academic research institution in the capital, the Academia Sinica has to jointly shoulder the mission of promoting academic research cooperation and mutual assistance at home and abroad. How to strengthen our country's academic research in the future, especially for the latest inventions in international science, how to strive to explore them in order to catch up with advanced countries, all depend on your consistent efforts and a quick catch-up. This is my earnest hope for you. Building a nation is based on academics. All the gentlemen present are academic experts in the country. Gathering wisdom and deliberating carefully, there will definitely be concrete plans to meet the needs of the times. The task is arduous and the road is long. The hearts of kind people and new scholars should explore the origin and investigate the principles of things in order to make contributions that are practical and innovative, increase national power, promote national glory, and be beneficial.

### The Era of "Human Bullet" and Broadsword is Over: Scientific Advancement Determines Victory in War - Minister Bai Stresses the Importance of National Defense Science

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Minister Bai Chongxi, in his address at the opening ceremony of the Central Research Institute's Council meeting on the 20th, eloquently discussed the importance of national defense science, hoping that scientists nationwide could collaborate with the Ministry of National Defense. Bai elaborated on President Chiang's instruction: "Without science, there is no national defense, and without national defense, there is no nation." The importance of science is thus evident. Recognizing this, one of the special characteristics of the Ministry of National Defense's organization is its emphasis on science. Two percent of the Ministry of National Defense's budget will be used for scientific research. From the perspective of science itself, its ultimate goal should be to benefit humanity. Regrettably, some ambitious individuals in the world have used science as a tool of war to destroy culture. Our emphasis on science is solely for self-defense and to maintain world peace, which is essential in the current stage. Bai cited examples of wars where science played a crucial role, proving that those with advanced science often achieve victory. Modern warfare, in particular, is determined by the level of scientific advancement, as this period is indeed a war of science, technology, and equipment. In the early stages of the War of Resistance, our country suffered setbacks, for which military personnel should bear responsibility, but scientists also bear a portion of the responsibility. The era of "human bullets" and broadswords is over. What determines victory is not the size of the population but the superiority of science. During the late stages of the War of Resistance, we were able to transition to an offensive and turn defeat into victory with the assistance of allied equipment, which serves as evidence. Bai resolutely stated: We do not hope for future wars, but we must prepare for them early. Our country's scientific foundation is inherently inferior to others, so we must catch up and make efforts that transcend the times. He also stated: Future wars will be sudden, destructive, and all-encompassing; therefore, peacetime and wartime should not be separated. We cannot wait until after mobilization to fight. Bai discussed the scientific research work undertaken by the Ministry of National Defense, stating: The Ministry of National Defense currently has several scientific research institutions and will send special talents abroad for advanced studies. Internationally, we will also seek to connect with friendly nations and recruit foreign scientists for our use. The scientific knowledge of officers and soldiers in the army, navy, and air force nationwide will also be utilized. However, in recent decades, we have relied heavily on foreigners, and what we have gained is only superficial. For example, after Prussia won the Franco-Prussian War, we copied the Prussian drill manual verbatim. When Japan won the Russo-Japanese War, we completely copied the Japanese drill manual. Now that both shoulder-carrying methods have failed, we are at a loss. This shows the fallacy of blindly copying. He hopes that scientists can cooperate with the Ministry of National Defense and work together.

### The Speed of Scientific Advancement in the World is Astonishing; Our Survival is Already Threatened - Zhu Jiahua's Opening Remarks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] In the opening ceremony of the Central Research Institute's Council meeting, Zhu Jiahua delivered the opening remarks, stating: The Central Research Institute is deeply pleased and honored to return to the capital for the second session of the third council annual meeting. It is a pity that the founder of this institute, former President Cai, who was also the former chairman of this council, passed away during the War of Resistance. We cannot receive his leadership today, which is the greatest regret. While we remember him, we should work harder to achieve the expectations that Mr. Cai placed on this institute. This institute is the highest academic institution in the country. During the War of Resistance, we were subjected to enemy blockades, and domestic transportation was inconvenient. We could not only not replenish equipment, but also international cooperation and connections were extremely difficult. It can be said that we could not fully fulfill our responsibilities. In addition, due to the hardships of materials, all work could not maintain constant progress. However, scholars across the country have continued to concentrate on research, and national academic progress is still considerable. The establishment of the Institute of Zoology and Botany and the planning of the Institutes of Mathematics and Medicine were all realized during this period. Research on the high-altitude ionosphere is beginning to take shape. This spirit should be continued. However, our academic research foundation is shallow, and the astonishing speed of scientific progress in the world during the war has made us unable to catch up. The international status of the entire nation, and even the issue of survival, has made us feel seriously threatened. Although the people of our country have been advocating Western academics for a long time, and the government, since establishing the capital in Nanjing, especially during the War of Resistance, has repeatedly emphasized the promotion of science, the results are limited. Recently, the Supreme National Defense Council resolved that the percentage of national budget allocated to scientific research will increase. After this practical and concrete resolution, an important stage will certainly be produced in the history of Chinese scientific research. Then, the resolutions of previous meetings of this council will have the opportunity to be implemented, which is worth celebrating.

### Nation-Building Depends on Science; Establishing the Nation Emphasizes Culture Even More

Wu Tiecheng Describes the Path Forward

Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng addressed the Council meeting, stating: Examining past history, the development of academic culture has been no more than two paths: one is the emergence of genius, and the other is the demands of the times. The invention of the compass and the armillary sphere are examples of this, which also shows that our country's academic culture has a brilliant and bright history. Furthermore, in the contemporary world, Mr. Weng Wenhao, Mr. Zhu Kezhen, and Mr. Hua Luogeng have all made outstanding achievements in geology, meteorology, and mathematics, which are valued by the world's academic community. Nation-building depends on academics, and establishing the nation emphasizes culture even more. If we want to catch up with European and American academic culture and build a prosperous and happy nation, we must bravely advance along the following paths: First, the foundation of culture lies in academics, and the progress of academics lies in research. Therefore, if we want to develop culture, we must be led forward by the Central Research Institute. Second, research academics must promote the spirit of science and use scientific methods. How to enrich the Central Research Institute and the food and books of schools at all levels in the future must be worked together to propose concrete measures. Third, research academics must have a stable environment, so that those engaged in academics can research with peace of mind. How to promote national unity and social peace is not only the responsibility of politicians but also the responsibility of academics. Fourth, those who research academics must have a stable life. If they are allowed to engage in national cultural work with an empty stomach, it is absolutely impossible. Therefore, guaranteeing the life of scholars is also an urgent issue.

### Academic Research Requires a Stable Life; Results Can Certainly Be Achieved in Just Ten Years - Hu Shi's Response

Hu Shi responded, stating: The government is very enthusiastic in promoting academic research. However, in fact, our experts and researchers are always suffocating under the burden of life. Some are sick in bed due to insufficient nutrition, and some are busy holding babies and emptying chamber pots for their wives, so there is no way to talk about academic research at all. Twenty or thirty years ago, the United States had no status in academics, but today this situation has changed significantly. The California Institute of Technology, established only twenty years ago, has produced many experts, many of whom have won the Nobel Prize. The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton stipulates that only those who have obtained a doctoral degree are qualified to enter for research. It accommodates experts who were exiled from Nazi Germany, such as Albert Einstein, the inventor of the theory of relativity, who have made glorious contributions to world academics. I used to think that it was a great regret that China did not have a university or research institution with a history of fifty years. Now my views are different. History and age are not enough to determine everything. If the government can stabilize our lives and have sufficient funding for our research, I believe that we can certainly achieve considerable results in just ten years. There is no shortage of talent in China. The medicine of Mr. Lin Kesheng, the psychology of Mr. Wang Jingxi, and the archeology of the gentlemen engaged in excavation in Anyang are all highly admired by experts around the world. What we need is a stable life. Only in a stable life can we concentrate all our energy on academic research. (See page eight for the opening of the Central Research Institute Council meeting)

### Envoy Sze Leaves Hangzhou for Nanjing This Morning - Attended the Reader Reception at Our Newspaper Office Yesterday - Won a Body Nourishing Product in the Lottery and Repeatedly Thanked Us

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Hangzhou, 20th] Ambassador Sze, accompanied by General Secretary Kui Sheng of the YMCA, went to Hushantang in Zhong'an Bridge in the city this morning for Holy Communion. Chairman Shen and Secretary-General Lei both attended. Ambassador Sze was invited to give a speech, promoting the Confucian idea of "establishing others as you wish to establish yourself, and enabling others as you wish to enable yourself." At the same time, his student Qian Runhuan, who had just come to Hangzhou from Beiping, and Qian's fiancée, Xue Peiying, who had rushed from Hong Kong, held a simple and solemn religious wedding officiated by Ambassador Sze in the Hushantang, which was built to commemorate Ambassador Sze's father, Stuart. At noon, the church held a public banquet for Ambassador Sze. After the banquet, he preached at Hushantang on the necessity of the union of various church denominations, and he forcefully stated that the Chinese political situation must also unite all parties in order to have a future. After the lecture, accompanied by Wang Kui Sheng and Tang Yu Mei, he drove to No. 78 Hubin Road, the Hangzhou office of this newspaper, and participated in the reader reception of this newspaper in his capacity as a reader. Director Chu Yusheng warmly entertained him and showed him around the various facilities of the office. He also read today's newspaper and saw that the Hangzhou dispatch on the front page of the second edition described his itinerary in more detail than other Shanghai newspapers. He smiled at Director Chu and thanked him repeatedly when he saw "A Record of Ambassador Sze's Former Residence" by our reporter Huang Xing Tian on page nine. Then, his friend gave him a receipt for a donation to this newspaper and invited him to participate in the lottery ceremony of the Shanghai major manufacturers' joint gift event of this newspaper. Ambassador Sze drew No. 23 and won a bottle of "Vita-Torque." Ambassador Sze accepted it with a smile and said: "Thank you! Thank you for the wonderful body nourishing product!" At this time, the room was full of onlookers, and the road in front of the steps outside the door was blocked. Everyone believed that Ambassador Sze would be able to live another seventy years as Chairman Shen said if he got this great product. Then, he inspected the statistical charts on the wall and repeatedly praised the daily increase in sales of this newspaper in Hangzhou and the comprehensiveness of the communication network in Zhejiang Province. He turned around and said to the reporter: "Your newspaper is so enterprising and promising, and its future is limitless." After speaking, he visited the Youth Hall to see Lu Fei's calligraphy exhibition. The author presented him with two pictures, "Autumn Chrysanthemum" and "Cloud Bamboo." Then, he was hired by alumni of Yenching University to take a boat to visit the West Lake. The scenery of the lake and mountains was as beautiful as ever. He said that he also loved the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, the Huxin Pavilion, the Autumn Moon on the Calm Lake, and the Chenghuang Mountain when he was a child. As the sun set in the west and the twilight was vast, he finished his tour and went to Louwailou for a banquet hosted by Yenching University alumni. After the meal, Ambassador Sze spent the last night of his trip in his second hometown. He will fly to Jianqiao tomorrow morning and return to Nanjing to continue to work for China's peace and unity.

### Sixty-One Overseas Chinese Illegally Entering the Philippines Deported

### Various Countries Implement Assimilation Education; Schools are Prohibited from Offering Chinese Classes; Overseas Chinese Compatriots Urgently Hope the Government Will Lodge Protests

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] It is reported that various countries are implementing assimilation education for our overseas Chinese compatriots. For example, the United States prohibits formal schools from offering Chinese classes. The Honolulu Board of Education has set restrictions on learning Chinese. In the Malaya-Singapore area, pre-war censorship of foreign books will be implemented. Teaching materials containing nationalistic ideas and social consciousness will be deleted. The shortage of overseas teachers is becoming increasingly serious, and it is difficult to hire teachers from China to go abroad due to immigration laws. As a result, most overseas students study English and do not know Chinese. Overseas Chinese elders miss their motherland and pay great attention to the education of the next generation. Although they run Chinese night schools to make up for it, the teaching materials are not suitable, and it is difficult to recognize square characters. On the contrary, they regard learning Chinese as a long journey. If this continues, in another thirty years, overseas Chinese in various places will be completely isolated from the culture of the motherland. Overseas Chinese newspapers will also be discontinued because no one can read them. This concerns the future of the country. Overseas Chinese compatriots deeply hope that the government will pay close attention and lodge serious protests with various countries to save the critical situation.

### Nanjing Municipal Senator Election - Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and Others All Voted in Person - The Final Results Will Be Officially Announced This Morning

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] The 20th was the election day for the first session of the Nanjing Municipal Senators. From 7:00 a.m., men, women, old and young gathered in front of the 114 regional election polling stations. Professional groups also gathered separately to conduct the second round of voting. Campaign slogans on the nearby walls were dazzling. Campaign programs broadcasted by radio were also heard everywhere. The citizens who visited the bustling city during the holiday formed a spectacle. Minister Zhang Lisheng, Mayor Ma Chaojun, Director Han Wenhuan, and Deputy Directors of the Election Office Chen Jianru and Yang Ketian, as well as various supervisors, went to various polling places early in the morning to inspect and instructed all registrars, scribes, and police officers to work carefully and maintain order. The special reporter car prepared by the municipal government was also full of Chinese and foreign reporters, who started from the city and circled around to observe the ceremony. First, they visited Mayor Ma's official residence at No. 1 Yihe Road. After Mayor Ma's wife personally served coffee, they boarded the car together at 9:40 a.m. and went to the No. 54 polling station of Langya Road Primary School to participate in the election. The Mayor and his wife followed the orderly line of voters and followed the regional election and voting procedures. First, they handed in their citizen certificates. After the registrar checked them, they stamped them with a "Regional Election Vote Cast" stamp and signed the voter registration book. After receiving the ballot and writing on it, they put it into the ballot box. The mayor's choice was the current speaker of the Provisional Senate, Chen Yuguang. His wife's target was kept secret. The reporter's special car continued to visit various polling stations. The general order was good. Only a few ignorant people were found to be signaling elections near the polling stations or unreasonably withholding ballots, all of which were corrected according to law. The second round of professional group elections was the most successful for the labor union. Wang Yisheng, director of the General Labor Union, was elected as the first senator of Nanjing at 11:00 a.m. with 186 votes. The order of the Chamber of Commerce was still good. Zhang Jianzhai, a famous doctor, and Shen Jiuxiang, a reporter stationed in Nanjing before the war, were elected in the free professional election. However, in the Education Association, a few bad people discredited the most powerful candidate, Li Qingsong, controlled the venue, and obstructed the election. Voting did not begin until 1:00 p.m. The regional election ended at 7:00 p.m. The supervisors, together with the chiefs of the districts and villages and representatives of the voters, publicly counted the votes that evening.

Editorial

### Hoping for a Brighter Political Situation from Now On

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representative Zhou Enlai and others, along with representatives of the Third Side, boarded a special government plane in the early dawn and went to Nanjing to resume the long-stalled peace talks. This is a major turning point in the current domestic situation, making all the people across the country who long for peace and unity feel extremely gratified, and rekindling a glimmer of hope for the domestic situation.

Since the government re-issued the armistice in June of this year, the peace talks have failed to resolve the issues. Instead, the distance between the two sides has grown further. The flames of war have also spread, despite the mediation of mediator Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. However, both sides were deadlocked over the issue of "three" and "five." Until recently, the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou, and the government issued an order to convene the National Assembly. The CCP's attitude became increasingly unreasonable, almost causing the peace talks, which were in a state of suspension, to fall into a crisis of complete collapse. People across the country were frightened by the seriousness of the situation, and their desire for peace became even more urgent. In view of this, the government adopted many opinions from other parties, and Chairman Chiang issued a statement on the 16th regarding the handling of the current situation, reiterating the government's fundamental attitude of always adhering to a political solution to domestic political problems, and proposing eight concrete measures to solve the CCP problem, which were unanimously supported by the whole country. The Third Side also believed that the time was pressing and that the CCP could not afford to miss this last opportunity, so they rose up and appealed, repeatedly urging Zhou Enlai and others in Shanghai to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to resume talks, and put forward the slogan of "talk, stop, talk." After two or three days of running around and exchanging views, they finally reached a conclusion in a harmonious atmosphere, deciding that CCP representative Zhou Enlai and others and representatives of the Third Side would go to Nanjing today.

Our newspaper's editorial has repeatedly pointed out that the government values the people's desire for peace and recuperation, so it does not hesitate to compromise and seek peace. It has also made great efforts to urge Zhou to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to resume talks. What was the government's representative doing, traveling back and forth between Nanjing and Shanghai twice? Wasn't it to leave a glimmer of hope for the country and prevent the people from suffering from the pain of war again? Before we heard the news that Zhou Enlai had agreed to go to Nanjing, we had already predicted that the government's sincerity in seeking peace would surely move even the hardest hearts. Now, Zhou Enlai finally did not disappoint us and boarded a plane to Nanjing this morning. This is indeed a success of the Third Side's mediation, but it is also a victory for public opinion. We expect that today, no party can openly violate public opinion!

However, Zhou's going to Nanjing to resume peace talks can only be regarded as a turning point in the current situation, leading to the reopening of peace talks. But whether the situation can be brightened from now on depends on the efforts of the KMT and the Communist Party and the Third Side in the peace talks. Most importantly, we must take a broad view, take into account the overall situation, and not argue over minor details. Therefore, we deeply hope that the CCP can also accept the eight points proposed by Chairman Chiang as the basis for peace talks. Otherwise, after the resumption of peace talks, there will be no clue, no direction, and the peace talks will still be long and full of dreams, and there is a danger of repeating the mistakes of the past, making our people happy in vain again.

In short, we have great expectations for Zhou Enlai and others' trip to Nanjing today to resume peace talks. We hope that the political situation will be brightened from now on, so that the aspirations of our people can be realized. In the future, not only will our people no longer suffer from the disasters of war, but we will also be able to see representatives of the people across the country and representatives of various parties gather together in the coming month on the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation to single-mindedly formulate a fundamental law for the country, so that China's politics can get on the track of constitutionalism as soon as possible.

### Byrnes' Speech

The Paris Peace Conference has just ended, and the United Nations General Assembly will be held in New York on the 23rd of this month. Although the Paris Peace Conference passed the draft peace treaties with the five countries of Italy, Romania, Finland, Hungary, and Bulgaria, there were many disturbances during the conference, and disputes arose in the meeting place, and the progress was not smooth. For example, the issues of the Port of Trieste and the free navigation of the Danube River have not been resolved due to the insistence of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. And the most unsettling phenomenon in the world is, as U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said, not the "provisions of the draft peace treaties" of the five countries, but the increasing tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, whether the Second United Nations General Assembly can be successful depends on whether the ruling authorities of the United States and the Soviet Union hold a friendly attitude. Byrnes's speech broadcast to the United States on the evening of the 18th has therefore attracted the attention of the world. Now that the speech has been published, Byrnes's attitude towards the Soviet Union is not as tough as before, and even Wallace, who opposes him, said that he "has made progress compared to his speech in Stuttgart, Germany." This is enough to prove that the United States is determined to have peace with the Soviet Union, which is worthy of the joy of peace-loving people around the world.

In his speech, Byrnes first tried his best to dispel the fear that a new war is inevitable, believing that this fallacy is the cause of tension between countries and within countries. This is indeed a penetrating remark. Since the end of World War II, the argument that a third world war is inevitable has been rife, especially after Stalin announced on February 9 this year that another war is inevitable, which filled the Soviet Union with fear, strengthened its military internally, and openly and secretly competed and expanded its so-called security zone externally. At the same time, the United States has also gradually developed a sense of fear. President Truman announced that the United States is now facing the same crisis as before the Pearl Harbor incident. The United States' attitude towards the Soviet Union has also become increasingly tough, and defense work has also been actively carried out.

The fear of war is certainly the crux of all problems. However, to eliminate this mentality, mutual concessions from both sides are necessary. If one side makes concessions and the other side oppresses, an understanding can certainly be reached, but it is not easy to do so unless there is absolute military superiority. Byrnes believes that the United States does not want to do this, and the United States does not want other countries to do it. Every understanding is to reconcile differences, not to have one country succumb to the autocratic will of another country. This is indeed an open and honest statement. Wallace's speech last time advocating appeasement towards the Soviet Union aroused dissatisfaction among public opinion in the United States and eventually led to his resignation. Byrnes's speech this time, while firm in its attitude towards the Soviet Union, showed considerable concessions and tolerance, as if he himself had extended a hand first, and the Soviet Union could dispel its fears and openly discuss with the United States, make mutual concessions, and avoid all conflicts.

Peace must be based on mutual trust, and understanding is based on mutual concessions. This is an irrefutable truth. Now, people around the world who are concerned about international politics, unless they have preconceived notions, have no reason to place all the responsibility for the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union on the shoulders of the ruling authorities of any one country. We can only fairly say that in the past, both the United States and the Soviet Union seemed to be a little lacking in this point of mutual trust. Stalin believed that war was inevitable, and Truman also made similar announcements. The Soviet Union disregarded the people's lives and fully expanded its military, and the United States seemed to have to make some preparations. The Soviet Union's expansion of its influence abroad naturally encountered resistance from the United States. In the United Nations organization, the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the Paris Peace Conference, the representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union and the representatives of countries closer to the two sides insisted on their positions on any issue, and it was very difficult to obtain a satisfactory solution, and the reason for this lies here. Victory has passed for a year, the world cannot be safe, and the United States and the Soviet Union must bear a great responsibility for showing mutual trust and mutual concessions.

In Byrnes's speech, he specifically pointed out four prerequisites for resolving world problems by peaceful means, the first of which is the necessity of establishing mutual trust and a spirit of coordination among nations, and at the same time, it is necessary to try to eliminate malicious propaganda. His own speech is based on a spirit of coordination and attempts to establish mutual trust. Therefore, the entire text is straightforward and frank, and it is a valuable diplomatic document. As for the other three points, if all countries must seek cooperation under the United Nations organization and with respect for the authority of the United Nations, no country can claim to have a "monopoly on virtue and wisdom," and no country can coerce, threaten, or use force to fill the established rights of other nations, this should be the criterion for general international relations in the current international situation. Byrnes also said: "We must cooperate with each other—with or without a veto—to defend the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter..." We hope that this spirit of coordination can be responsive, then international cooperation will not be difficult to achieve, and the guarantee of lasting world peace can be hoped for.

### Active Relief Efforts in Northern Jiangsu Province Focus on Food, Finance, and Security Refugees Return to Their Hometowns to Rebuild Their Devastated Homes

[Report from Suzhou by our newspaper] After the recovery of various counties in northern Jiangsu, General Li Mo'an, commander of the First Pacification Zone, specially dispatched Major General Cheng Muyi, a senior staff officer of his department, to northern Jiangsu to be responsible for the work of calming and supervising. Recently, Mr. Cheng arrived in Suzhou on the 18th at about 4 p.m. from his post on official business. After hearing the news, the special reporter of our newspaper stationed in Suzhou went to visit him by bicycle late at night to inquire about the general situation in northern Jiangsu. Mr. Cheng gave a detailed account, which is briefly recorded as follows. Since the 4th of this month, the National Army in northern Jiangsu launched the defense battle of the Lianhe Line, giving a head-on blow to the invading Communist Army. On the morning of the 6th, it moved into Shaobo, and on the 8th, it recovered Gaoyou. At the same time, the National Army that went south from the north also advanced rapidly and met in Fanshui as scheduled, cutting off the Grand Canal Line that had been cut off for nearly ten months, and was able to recover it in the shortest week. The magistrates of Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an, and other counties who are currently refugees in Jiangdu have returned to their original posts, and the refugees in each county have also returned to their hometowns one after another to rebuild their devastated homes. The most serious problems in northern Jiangsu at present are roughly three: (1) Food panic. When the Communist Army occupied and then withdrew, all the rice, paddy, and wheat were taken away, which made the food panic of the returning refugees even more serious. The government is now trying to provide relief in many ways. (2) Financial exhaustion. When the Communist Army controlled northern Jiangsu, it issued an uncountable amount of resistance currency. Although it has now stopped circulating, the heavy losses suffered by the people are irreparable. Recently, the Central Farmers Bank is starting to set up branches and offices in major cities and towns to prepare to provide agricultural loans to regulate financial exhaustion. (3) Security concerns: Although the Communist Army has retreated to the north one after another after being counterattacked by the National Army, there are still a small number of them who have disintegrated and are roaming near the cities and towns, which has a great impact on security. The authorities are now besieging and suppressing them in order to clear each county seat that has been restored. Self-defense teams are established, and the government allocates guns to help consolidate local security.

[Report from Haizhou by our newspaper] The Suling Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration believed that there were many refugees in the Haizhou area and that it was necessary to continue to allocate materials for relief. Now, the Suling Branch has approved the allocation of the fourth batch of relief materials of 1,000 tons, which were loaded on the Yongxing ship in Shanghai and arrived in Lianyungang on the 15th. Tens of thousands of refugees were overjoyed.

[Report from Nantong by our newspaper] The Linshan Conference and the county party headquarters believed that the weather was suddenly cold and that most of the refugees did not have cotton clothes to keep warm, so they jointly telegraphed the Zhenbei Suling Branch to quickly transport the promised 1,000 sets of cotton clothes to Tong, so that they could be distributed to the refugees as soon as possible to keep them warm and avoid the refugees from being frozen and sick. Also, because the Nantong branch of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau has a large number of old military uniforms and shoes, which have been stored for a long time and may become waste, they jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau to ask the county to order the Nantong branch to transfer them to the refugees in northern Jiangsu free of charge, so as to avoid most of the refugees from being unable to withstand the cold.

### A Glimpse of the Rural Areas of Southern Jiangsu Unsound Self-Government Allows Bandits to Thrive The Remote Areas Have a Utopia, Lamentable Gap Between Officials and People The Superintendent Returns for a Chat

[Report from Suzhou by our newspaper on the 20th] Dai Jianhua, the magistrate of Su County and superintendent, set off on the 16th with Jin Qigong, the secretary-general of the party headquarters and deputy superintendent, and led the responsible officials of security, civil affairs, and military affairs and a part of the military force to the county-affiliated second, third, and fourth districts in the Taihu Lake area to supervise and guide the implementation of the suppression work and reorganize the Baojia system. It took five days, traveling through more than ten towns and villages such as Mudu, Guangfu, Xihua Island, Tong'an Bridge, Xiangshan, and Dongzhu, and returned to the city on the 20th via Huzhen Pass. The special reporter of our newspaper stationed in Suzhou visited Mr. Dai and Mr. Jin at their private residences at about 7 p.m. to inquire about their general impressions of the rural areas on this trip. Both gave very detailed accounts, which are summarized as follows: (1) Because the autumn harvest this year was extremely good, most tenant farmers had surplus grain, and agricultural implements were quite complete. Although there were signs of shortage, it could not be called exhaustion. (2) The security of the rural areas, except for towns such as Guangfu, Mudu, and Huzhen Pass, Xihua Island, Tong'an Bridge, Xiangshan, Dongzhu, and other places were said to be the mobile areas of Xue Yonghui's bandit group. However, after searching, no bandits were found. According to local elders, there were very few disturbances. Now, a squadron of the Security Brigade led by Wei Sun Shen has been sent to cooperate with the Lian Qingjiao District. The soldiers went deeper into the remote villages in the Xiangshan, Yangshan, and Baima areas to search, and winter defense joint offices were set up in Tong'an Bridge and Xihua Island to concentrate the self-defense team guns from the five neighboring villages, unify the distribution and coordination, disband the original self-defense team members, assess them separately, train them, and prepare to complete the training of 1,200 strong men in a short period of time. Each office is equipped with 600 people, becoming a regular local armed force, and each squadron of the Security Brigade is stationed. (3) Rural education is still relatively common, but Xihua Island is an island area extending into Taihu Lake, divided into five villages, and there is only one primary school, which urgently needs to be added. (4) Rural transportation, except for Xihua Island, all towns are along highways or railways. It has now been decided to build a 10-mile-long section of the Sufu Highway from Guangfu to Xihua Island. (5) Rural autonomy is generally not sound enough, and township chiefs are not responsible, which is a common phenomenon. An adjustment plan has now been drafted. Mr. Dai also used Xihua Island as an example and said to the reporter with emotion: The island has fertile land, almost a utopia, but the government has never paid attention to it, and even self-government and administration have not been promoted, so that the general people almost do not know how to distinguish between soldiers and bandits. To put it bluntly, there is almost no impression of what is called the government in the minds of the people on the island. The gap between officials and people has reached this extreme, so that Xue Yonghui's bandit group often appears and disappears, without any scruples, and it is rumored that Xihua has almost become a gathering place of terror. After my inspection, I saw that the folk customs were simple and honest, and the products were extremely rich. If the economy, transportation, and education can be developed with each other, it may become a good model village. It is known that after the 24th of this month, Mr. Dai will visit the East and West Dongting Mountains and Hengjing and other places, and invite reporters to go together to see the real situation of the rural areas.

### Mudu District Chief Accepts Bribes to Protect Gambling

[Report from Suzhou by our newspaper] At this time of the new harvest season, the four villages in this county are all having bumper harvests, and the price of rice is high this year. The villagers are all happily counting their money earned from selling rice. After a year of hard work, it is inevitable that they will want to use prostitution and gambling to adjust their spirits. The Provisional Council of this county has long been aware of this and has discussed methods to prohibit gambling in the townships and districts. After sending a letter to the county government to handle the matter, the county government has ordered each district to strictly prohibit it and ordered each district chief to take full responsibility to emphasize their responsibilities. However, Qin Xigui, the district chief of Mudu District, a subordinate of the county, ignored the law and let the local hooligan Zhou Changyan take advantage of the opportunity to open a gambling den in the Fushou Temple on West Street in the town, sitting back and reaping the profits. The ignorant villagers lost all their hard-earned money in an instant. After opening for a month, there were not a few cases of people being ruined and impoverished. The Wuxian County Government found out about this and strictly ordered the Mudu Patrol Office to work with the district office self-defense team to arrest them. Except for those who escaped over the wall after hearing the news, the gambling boss Zhou Changyan and seven gamblers were arrested and escorted to the city on the 18th. The military law office of the county government questioned them in detail. The gambling boss Zhou Changyan immediately confessed that the Mudu District Office, from the district chief to the clerks and district guards, all received offerings on a daily basis, ranging from 10,000 yuan to several thousand yuan per day depending on the size of the position, and firmly stated that the confessions were all facts and could provide solid evidence. It is heard that the county magistrate of this county believed that the current district chief dared to disregard the law, accept bribes, and protect gambling, and decided to severely punish him according to the law to serve as a warning to others.

### Huhu Police Station Escorts the Boats Grain Rent Standard Agreed

[Report from Pinghu by our newspaper] With the winter defense period approaching and the reorganization of the self-defense team underway, local security is extremely important. In order to improve water security, the police station will organize a winter escort team from the 1st of next month and send police to armed protection of the boats. Also, after the self-defense squadron of Xintaidu Town was dispatched, people were panicked, fearing that lawless people would cause trouble. It was agreed that patrols would begin immediately from now and that traffic would be cut off after 7:00 p.m.

[Another Report] The standard for the amount of grain rent to be paid this year has been decided by the joint meeting of the County整理自治財政委員會 and the Public Property Management Committee. The county is divided into three grades: Grade A pays 3斗5升25净 per亩, Grade B pays 2斗9升4, and Grade C pays 2斗2升77.

### Robbery Occurs Near Jiangyin During Suppression Period

[Report from Jiangyin] Xiaojia Village, 17th Bao of Tongyun Town outside the South Gate, is about four miles away from the city and is located on the Chengxi Highway. At about 10 p.m. on the 17th, six people speaking a local dialect in plain clothes and short clothes suddenly came to the area, holding flashlights and pistols. They went to Zhang Hufei's house and robbed it, and beat Zhang's wife, Qian.

At dawn, the families checked the losses, totaling more than ten million in value. On the afternoon of the 18th, Tian长 Xu Kun Baob长 Liu Xicheng reported to the Chengqu Office to forward it to the county. The county magistrate was furious because a large-scale robbery occurred in the suburbs during this suppression period. He immediately手論 military section chief Chen Tao and limited him to solve the case and arrest the murderer within ten days.

### Gu Zhutong Sends Two Key Personnel to Wuhu to Assist in Investigation and Negotiate Prices for Compensation of Sold Materials

[Report from Wuhu from This Newspaper, 20th] (1) Gu Zhutong has dispatched Lieutenant General Senior Advisor Lu Xu and Finance Director Bing Xun to Wuhu yesterday to assist Ma Jingchang from Wuxi in investigating the materials of the Fifth Receiving Group of the Former Third War Area, and to negotiate prices for compensating over a thousand tons of rapeseed, soybeans, and wheat sold in Shanghai. (2) The Chaoxian Coal Mine, located 200 miles from Wuhu, was taken over by local powerful figures who used security teams to protect it after the enemy and puppets handed it over. They employed new machinery from the Ma'anshan Mine in Dangtu to extract coal, which was transported and sold to Nanjing and Wuhu, generating profits exceeding one billion yuan. Upon arriving in Wuhu, Ma immediately telegraphed Chairman Li Pinxian requesting an investigation and reply, and dispatched personnel to assist in the investigation. Ten days have passed since the telegram was sent, but no reply has been received. Ma is still patiently waiting for a response from the Anhui Provincial Government, but he is determined not to let this case go. (3) He Zongzhang, the former police chief of Wuhu, was summoned for discrepancies in the handover of materials after leaving his post. He refused to meet. Ma telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to summon him, but received no response. He is from Henan and owns property at the Taikoo Wharf in Wuhu. Ma believes that if He does not come for questioning, he will bear the consequences himself. (4) Ma Zhonghe from Yumin Rice Mill sent someone to claim that the factory's machinery was purchased from a Mr. Chen, who has already sent a telegram from Suzhou to prove it. The factory's machinery has been sealed. (5) On the 18th, Ma discovered that the Yuanchang Flour Mill was the property of the traitor Li Huilong, the former chairman of the puppet chamber of commerce. When Li fled, he colluded with a Mr. Pan, the adjutant Li Zhiqian of a certain division, and Commander Mo, changing the mill's name and selling it to a Mr. Ke from Anqing for 21 million yuan before the investigation team arrived in Wuhu. This case has been investigated, and the factory will be sealed. (6) Gu Zhi Long, the representative of the China Mining Bureau of the National Resources Commission in charge of receiving the Digang Mine, is suspected of obstructing mine owners from reclaiming small coal mines for self-management and coercing subordinates to provide false evidence. Ma has investigated the matter and handed it over to the court. Ma is in Wuhu and still needs to deal with the Chaoxian Coal Mine and He Zongzhang cases, which will cause delays.

### Chuansha County Government Employees Draw Lots to Distribute Uniforms

[Report from Chuansha from This Newspaper] A local gentleman in this county generously donated over 300 sets of cotton uniforms, three bolts of khaki cloth, and several boxes of other daily necessities. Originally, it was planned to allocate all these items to the county's security team and police station. However, County Magistrate Wang, sympathizing with the meager salaries and difficult lives of the county government's junior staff, specifically stipulated that each staff member below the rank of section chief should receive a set of uniform. But there were fewer clothes than people, making distribution difficult. Therefore, a lottery was held. Those who won a set were overjoyed, while those who got nothing lamented their bad luck.

### Haining's Autumn Silkworm Crop Fails, Requesting Exemption from Seed Loan Payments

Agricultural Bank Limits Repayment of Silkworm Loans by End of Month

[Report from Haining from This Newspaper] This county's silk industry has been quite developed. During the war, it was ravaged by the enemy and puppets and was on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to develop the rural economy and enrich the people's livelihood, the county government assisted the silkworm industry promotion office in providing silkworm seed loans. Unexpectedly, the weather this autumn has been exceptionally hot, resulting in a disastrous harvest, only one or two tenths of the usual yield. Furthermore, this year's rice harvest has also failed, leaving the rural economy at a standstill. Farmers are unable to cope with the required seed loan payments, and villagers have flocked to the county government to request exemptions. The county government, recognizing the situation, telegraphed the provincial promotion office yesterday, requesting approval for the exemptions.

[Another Report] The China Farmers Bank will set up a branch office in Xia, and Xia Dingfang has been appointed as the director, which will open soon.

### Chinese Medicine Practitioners Should Regulate Consultation Fees

Reading the article "Autumn Brings More Illnesses, Patients Cannot Afford Doctors' Fees" on the 14th, I am deeply moved. I have long intended to ask the government to explicitly regulate the consultation fees of Shanghai doctors, which vary widely. Some say it may cause controversy, so I have hesitated to do so, but I always feel like a bone stuck in my throat, and I have to spit it out. Therefore, I contribute my humble opinion, stating it as follows:

It is said that there are three major elements of a doctor: learning, knowledge, and courage. Reading ten thousand books, unprecedented, is called learning; vast experience, accurate diagnosis, is called knowledge; prescribing medicine according to the illness, appropriate attack and supplementation, is called courage. Possessing all three, ancient people believed that the art of medicine was complete. But today, it is no longer easy to say this. Now, I set aside this and mention what I call the root. What is the root? It is morality. If we speak of learning without morality, it is inevitable to embellish cunning; if we speak of knowledge without morality, it is inevitable to indulge in bias; if we speak of courage without morality, it is inevitable to increase recklessness. Moreover, doctors have different personalities, and their classes are uneven. Secretly passing down teachings, each adheres to their own correctness. Without medical ethics to guide them back to the right path, wouldn't the great undertaking of wise hearts and benevolent arts be comparable to witchcraft and fortune-telling, making the sacred art of medicine like lightning across the sky, sometimes hidden, sometimes bright, and like a stream of water in an ancient valley, sometimes cut off, sometimes continued, isn't that regrettable? But morality is nothing more than pure conduct and noble intelligence, both of which are sufficient to fulfill it.

However, morality and fame are not mutually compatible, and only those who can abandon profit can be spoken to. It is reasonable for doctors to seek reward and for patients to reward doctors. But today's doctors are contrary to medical ethics. Regarding their own consultation fees, they are accustomed to varying widely. They like to display high prices, making themselves look important, and ignorant patients believe that their skills must be exquisite because of their high consultation fees, competing to invite them (this is also the case with Western medicine). Thus, the doctors' plans succeed, and the world is like this. Hypocrisy becomes more skilled, and without learning to deceive, it is difficult to make a living. The medical atmosphere in Shanghai has reached this point, it is simply unbearable to ask! Mencius said: The heart of compassion, everyone has it. Those who practice medicine, since they hold the power of life, should have a heart to help the world. But to take advantage of people in times of crisis, to kick a man when he is down, looking back and reflecting on oneself, is it right or wrong to betray morality and take profit? It doesn't matter to the wealthy, but how can the poor and sick bear it? It is requested that the Beijing municipal government's regulations from 26 years ago be used as a precedent to regulate the consultation, house call, and registration fees of Chinese medicine practitioners in a unified manner, and that it be implemented in this city so that we can speak of "benefiting the poor and sick." (Wuwuo)

### Improving Transportation in Pudong

To improve the appearance of the city and prosper urban commerce, it is necessary to first move the smog-filled factories to the suburbs of the city. However, establishing a transportation network in the suburbs of the city is also a matter of urgency! The authorities have also considered the importance of this issue and have planned the "Pujiang Iron Bridge." However, it seems necessary to improve the existing transportation as well.

(1) Revise the Standard Time of the Municipal Ferry: In this "house shortage" city, the average salaried civil servants, etc., do not have "gold bars" to buy western-style houses, so they have to find housing in the suburbs of the city—Pudong. In the past summer time, the first municipal ferry arrived at the Shanghai pier at only 8:00, and the last ferry back left at 6:00; this did not conflict with the time of government agencies or offices, and they could still return in time. Starting on the first of this month, it was changed to standard time, the morning ferry arrived in Shanghai at 9:20, and the last ferry back to Pudong left at 5:45; this has made it difficult for general office workers who leave early and return late.

(2) Operate Public Buses after Repairing the Highway: In the Premier's plan for national construction, there is a plan to "build 100,000 miles of highway and 100,000 miles of railway." I remember that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, our government authorities built a coal seam highway along the Pudong coast. Before the war, there were public buses operating between the Lan Nidu and Yangjingzhen. However, after more than eight years of destruction by the enemy and puppets and disrepair, the road surface has become "full of holes." After this victory, public buses were restored without repairing the highway, and the route was quite long, so this great highway has become one hole in the east and one hole in the west, rugged and uneven. When it rains, mud splashes everywhere.

Finally, I saw in the newspaper that the Public Works Bureau has taken measures to ban rickshaws and eliminate tricycles. However, the drivers have started a petition to the capital because of the threat to their livelihoods. In my humble opinion, it may be possible to allow these vehicles that have been suspended to operate in the suburbs. First, it can maintain the livelihoods of these drivers, and second, because the vehicles are lighter, it can maintain the integrity of the current highways. What do the authorities think? (Ma Min)

### Parks Should Have Fitness Equipment

The only place in this city for citizens to exercise is the City Stadium (speaking of those near the city center). The fitness equipment there only includes one set of parallel bars and one set of horizontal bars, and there is no sand pit underneath, but a hard square brick ground. I personally saw a citizen who accidentally fell while practicing on the horizontal bar. As a result, his head was broken and bleeding, and the square brick ground was stained with blood. If there was a sand pit underneath, then although he might be injured, it would not be so severe. The park is the place with the cleanest air in the city, and many citizens exercise there every morning. Why not use the park as a place to set up one or two parallel bars and horizontal bars as a place for citizens to exercise? It does not take up much space, so why not do it? This only takes a single effort from the relevant authorities, but it is beneficial to the national fitness.

### Safeguarding the Empire's Lifeline in the Middle East: Outline of British Defense Plans, Establishing Bases on the East and West Coasts of Africa, 3,000-Mile Super Highway Traversing the Black Continent

[United Press, London, 19th] The reorganization of Britain's eastern lifeline may result in the establishment of bases on the east and west coasts of Africa, connected by a 3,000-mile super highway through the "Black Continent." The outline of this imperial defense plan has been revealed by government, colonial, and army departments, as many Middle East experts and military and political leaders are gathering in London for continuous meetings. Behind this plan is the implication that Britain has decided to withdraw from Egypt. The important political disputes in the Middle East and the important lessons of World War II are that the Mediterranean is not impregnable. The new Colonial Secretary Jones gave reporters a clear indication of this large-scale reorganization for the first time today. It is said that a plan is currently being discussed to build a large-scale base in Nigeria on the west coast of Africa, similar to the previously rumored government plan to establish a base on the east coast of the Kenyan colony. Although Jones's remarks were limited to colonial activities and did not provide details, military sources revealed that if bases were established on both coasts, defense advisors would recommend building artificial highways to connect them through the equatorial African deserts, forests, and swamps. One of the new Defense Secretary Alexander's top priorities is to study these interconnected proposals and present the Cabinet with the entire imperial military strategy plan. British military and political leaders have been discussing the consequences of the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the independence of India for several months. According to military sources, the report submitted by various experts to Prime Minister Attlee has determined four points regarding Britain's military role in the Middle East: (1) Defending the intercontinental lifeline—which now extends from Gibraltar through Suez to the Indian Ocean. (2) Defending the Middle East airfields, which are necessary for modern transportation. (3) Defending oil rights in Iran and Iraq. (4) Maintaining long-term alliances with the Arab world and promoting relations with Turkey.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th Special Telegram] Major General Martin, the military reporter for Scotland's first daily newspaper, "The Scotsman," said that in view of the unstable situation in East Asia, Britain should establish a Pacific naval base in Australia rather than in Hong Kong and Singapore. Martin's opinion was expressed when elaborating on the statement made by Australian Prime Minister Chifley. Chifley said: The British and Australian sides are currently discussing the establishment of a permanent British Pacific naval base in Australia. Martin said: In this atomic age, especially in view of the turbulent situation in East Asia, Britain must have a major base in Australian territorial waters.

### The United States and the Soviet Union Should Understand Each Other, War is Not Inevitable: Vandenberg Broadcast Reviews the Path to Peace

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Republican Senator Vandenberg, the U.S. representative to the Paris Peace Conference, tonight participated in a current affairs question-and-answer broadcast on the Columbia radio station with radio reporters. Vandenberg said, "The Soviet Union does not want war, and the United States does not want war. I hope we can stop talking about war." He added, "The foreign policy of the United States is a policy of peace, and it will succeed if it is not undermined domestically." When asked if this foreign policy was a tough policy towards the Soviet Union, he replied, "No, it is best described as a friendly and firm policy." Vandenberg also said, "We must be frank with the Soviet Union, our words, intentions, and actions must be consistent, and we must not say one thing and mean another, or act against our intentions. I also agree with Stalin's statement that 'Eastern communism and Western democracy can establish the principle of survival and make it survive.' But I must reiterate what I said before, that this cannot be achieved through unilateral efforts. I must make the United States do its best to eliminate the reasons for the Soviet Union's reasonable fears. We are doing this today, but the Soviet Union must also do the same. Today, the Soviet Union is still far from this. I have never heard any U.S. representative at the Paris Peace Conference accuse the Soviet Union's motives, but Soviet spokesmen and their partners have repeatedly made baseless accusations of the United States' motives. We may not yet understand Moscow, but Moscow clearly misunderstands us. The Russians should know that we have no conspiracy to conquer them. God can prove that we have no such thought in our souls. But we must also know that they have no intention of promoting a communist world." Vandenberg repeatedly said that the Soviet Union is a great country with great people, and we have a historical friendship with them, and this friendship must be maintained.

### Connally Talks About the Achievements of the Peace Conference

Another United Press dispatch on the 19th: Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, returned from the Paris Peace Conference and told reporters on the Queen Elizabeth that he trusted the United Nations Security Council to enforce the resolution that Yugoslavia declared it was not bound by the peace treaty. We must not have another Fiume incident in this dispute. Yugoslavia declared that it would not abide by the treaty, but other countries can take action on their own in accordance with the terms of the treaty. If the Security Council does not have its own army at that time, it can ask the British and American countries to allocate troops and place them under its command. The Security Council has the right to act in accordance with the treaty. Connally advocated the restoration of German industry, saying that Europe needs Germany, and the United States does not want to destroy Germany. Connally also agreed with Byrnes's recent speech on the Paris Peace Conference, saying that the Paris Conference had achieved great success.

### Truman Expresses Sympathy for Byrnes's Speech

### White House Denies Stalin Visiting the United States

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] A Canadian newspaper reported that Stalin will visit the United States and Canada in November. This statement was denied by a White House spokesman, who said that he had neither heard of this statement nor had it been heard of in the White House Secretariat.

[Reuters, Halifax, 19th] The Halifax Chronicle reported that a high-level source said that when the British ship "Hokitanika" sails to the United States at the end of the month, Marshal Stalin will take the ship to the United States and may also visit Canada. A cabin has been prepared for Marshal Stalin on the ship. This news has not yet been confirmed. It is reported that the ship has been leased by British transportation to carry representatives of the Foreign Ministers' Conference to New York, scheduled to set sail from England on October 27.

### United Nations General Assembly to Open the Day After Tomorrow; US President Will Personally Deliver a Speech; Heavy Disputes in the Provisional Agenda of the Assembly

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The White House announced: President Truman is scheduled to fly to New York on the 23rd of this month to address the United Nations General Assembly at 9:30 PM (Standard Time, 5:30 AM Shanghai Time on Thursday). The President will also attend a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to entertain representatives of various countries and officials of UN agencies and will return to Washington by train at night. President Truman met with Secretary of State Byrnes, Under Secretary of State Acheson, and Representative to the UN Agencies Austin at the White House today to discuss plans for the General Assembly.

[United Press, New York, 19th] The United Nations General Assembly is now scheduled to open here on the 23rd, and its provisional agenda is full of contentious issues. Since the San Francisco UN Charter Conference, this General Assembly will be the largest and most historic international conference within the United States, not only because it is the first time the UN legislative body has convened in the US, but also because many extremely important issues need to be addressed at this session. The first half of the United Nations General Assembly was held in London in January and February of this year, and its main task was to establish several complex institutions. This session will take action on various important issues, such as the Franco regime issue, the relief of millions of European refugees, the issue of the use of the veto power in the Security Council, the reconstruction plan for areas that have suffered from war, the selection of a permanent site for the UN agencies, and the establishment of the UN Trusteeship Council. The future of Palestine may also be brought up for discussion. In addition, there is a very contentious issue on the provisional agenda: the Soviet Union has requested a report on the presence of foreign troops in non-enemy territories. This issue will involve the US troops stationed in China, Iceland, and Panama, and the British troops stationed in Iraq, Greece, Outer Jordan, and British India.

### US Representative to the Security Council Calls on Members to Cease Strife

[United Press, New York, 19th] The United States Representative to the United Nations Security Council, Johnson, delivered a speech to the representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly on the 19th at the Foreign Policy Association, arguing that major powers should cooperate with each other in the Security Council, stop attacking each other and making unrealistic accusations and counter-accusations, and criticized the "abuse of the Security Council" and the "excessive use of the veto power" by various countries. It is said that the people of the world have deep concerns about the way the Security Council is used, and we all feel the need to replace mutual blame with a spirit of cooperation. If we are willing, we should strive harder for peace, not just for the victory of debate, and thus change the atmosphere of international relations.

### Dutch Government to Propose Re-surveying the Dutch-German Border

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 19th] Regarding the issue of re-surveying the border between the Netherlands and Germany, the Dutch government will convene the House of Representatives in the shortest possible time to present a plan to it. If the plan is approved by the parliament, it will be submitted to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. According to this plan, any protruding areas on the border between the two countries should be incorporated into Dutch territory to straighten the border line. As for the small number of Germans within the land incorporated into Dutch territory, it is difficult to transport them to the British occupation zone, so it has been decided to let them remain in their original places. In addition, the Dutch government is also considering incorporating the island of Borkum, outside the German port of Emden, into its territory.

### The Work of the Allied Control Committee for Japan is Nominal; British Indifference, US and Soviet Union Sleep in Different Beds

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Japan and Hungary are both defeated countries and both have Allied Control Committees that perform nominal occupation work. The Soviet Union naturally regards itself as the true master of Hungary, and MacArthur also naturally regards himself as the true master of Japan. The UN Headquarters in Japan does not welcome the concept of the Control Committee, and even expressed this before the Control Conference. Six months after the establishment of the Control Committee, MacArthur's representative, Acheson, the chairman of the Control Committee, hinted that MacArthur believed that the Committee was ineffective; in fact, the main function of the Control Committee is equivalent to a strong sounding board. The United States and the Soviet Union use it to accuse each other and expand propaganda. The Soviet representative, Teleftianko, apparently believes that the Control Committee is slightly useful. Mr. Teleftianko can reflect the Soviet government's emotions towards MacArthur at the meeting, and MacArthur's handling of the occupation zone is criticized by the Soviet press. The British representative, Baer, believes that even if the Control Committee has any value, it is minimal; the Chinese representative, Zhu Shiming, follows Acheson's lead. If at least two or even three of the four representatives of the Control Committee have doubts about the value of the meeting itself, what will the Committee achieve? To date, the Committee has passed the Land Reform Law, the Labor Law, and heard various suggestions regarding the nationalization of Japanese coal mines. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference organized the Control Committee for Japan to provide consultation to MacArthur, and MacArthur clearly decided that the Committee should not overstep into the scope of the administrative authority of the occupation of Japan. Acheson has often rejected some suggestions from the Soviet Union on the grounds of administrative matters. The representatives angrily stated at the meeting that the Headquarters neither acknowledged nor responded to their suggestions. Acheson's invariable reply was that the Headquarters welcomed criticism; in other words, MacArthur considered their opinions and made his own decisions.

### MacArthur Headquarters Claims No Policy Changes

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] A spokesman for MacArthur Headquarters said: There has been no change in the policy towards Japan. The statement made by Acheson, the US representative to the Allied Control Committee, on October 16th that Japan's goals are now almost the same as those of the Allies, has been misunderstood as a change in the basic policy towards Japan. In fact, Mr. Acheson's statement was merely an acknowledgement of some of the meritorious actions of the Japanese government and people.

### Communist Party Attacked in French Election Campaign

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] After the new French constitution was passed by referendum, a general election will be held in November of this year to form the National Assembly. The three major parties, namely the Popular Republican Movement, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, have launched election campaigns. The Popular Republican Movement is determined to form a party alone without seeking cooperation from the Communist Party. Chairman Schumann of the Popular Republican Movement declared in a campaign speech in Chives City yesterday, "We ask you to support our party and end the tripartite coalition government." At the same time, the chairman of the Socialist Party, the former Minister of Interior Troquet, delivered a speech in Nantes City, severely criticizing the Communist Party, believing that the Communist Party lacks independence. He said, "If the Communist Party is a domestic organization and does not follow foreign doctrines, and if the party embraces freedom first rather than the Soviet Union first, then the solidarity between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party can be reviewed." From the general trend, if the Socialist Party can control the Communist Party, it seems that it will join the government, and we can only support the Popular Republican Movement to form a party alone.

### Three Bombs Explode in the Stuttgart District

### Truth about Goering's Suicide

Difficult to Complete Report Recently

[Central News Agency, Nuremberg, 19th United Press] The US military laboratory is expected to publish the final report on the qualitative test of the poison taken by Goering today, in order to complete the final official report on Goering's bizarre suicide case. Prison authorities refused to disclose exactly what this report might involve, but stated that this report is unlikely to be completed before the 22nd. It was originally hoped that the report of the investigative committee could be submitted today, but a laboratory expert had to go to Paris for an important task, and the nature of this important task was not disclosed, so the Goering suicide report will be delayed.

Berlin citizens held a large-scale demonstration holding red flags against the Nuremberg Tribunal's release of three Nazi war criminals, including Papen and Schacht. According to reports, this demonstration was launched by the Soviet Union.

### US State Department Reveals Eight-Point Economic Program

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Clayton, the economic assistant of the State Department, issued a statement today listing eight major points of US economic policy, namely (1) The United States supports the promotion of international commercial law. (2) The United States supports reducing tariffs and restricting preferential treatment systems. (3) Complete abolition of import quotas. (4) Suppression of collusion. (5) Establishment of agreements between countries to dispose of surplus raw materials. (6) Establishment of a pure commercial trading system for transactions between government agencies of various countries. (7) Establishment of an international trade organization by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. (8) All countries adopt laws to ensure the possibility of their people obtaining normal work.

Clayton also stated that although the United States has gained its current power during the war, it still does not harbor any economic imperialist ambitions. The United States has largely been an exporting country in the past, and now urgently wants to expand imports because it lacks raw materials such as manganese and tungsten. The disappearance of some of the United States' resources is partly due to the war. As for the currency issue, it is very important that foreign countries must pay in US dollars if they want to buy goods from the United States.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th United Press] US Assistant Secretary of State Clayton broadcast today that the United States' natural resources have been exhausted during the war, so it may soon be forced to rely on imports of raw materials from other countries. The main ones are copper, lead, zinc, and high-quality iron. The United States' copper reserves can only last for 25 to 30 years.

### UN General Assembly News, Please Listen to the Mandarin Broadcast

The broadcast time to the Far East is 5:30 AM.

### Retrospect and Prospect of the Japanese Textile Industry

[This newspaper Tokyo correspondent, 19th] The Japanese textile industry has a modern industrial form, starting between Meiji 25 and 29 (i.e., 1896). At that time, there were only 57 companies with 600,800 spindles. The United Kingdom and the United States had already established modern textile industries as early as 1846. In 1846, the United Kingdom had 15,554,619 spindles; the United States had 3.5 million spindles. The textile industry is one of Japan's central industries and has established the foundation for the Japanese Empire's outward expansion. The Japanese Empire started with light industry, and a history of the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire can be said to be a history of the development of the Japanese textile industry. Japan's first export of cotton cloth was to China, starting in Meiji 24 (1890). At that time, Japan experienced an economic panic, and sales stagnated, so it had to open up foreign markets. In that year, 6,435 catties of cotton cloth were shipped to China (each catty is 0.6 kilograms). With the expansion of commodity exports, capital exports followed. According to the statistics yearbook of the Diamond Economic Magazine: In Showa 15 (1939), there were 54 textile manufacturers in China (including the three northeastern provinces), with 2,223,200 spindles and 34,300 looms. The Japanese mainland textile industry was affected by the war, and many peace industries were converted into military industries. Moreover, due to air strikes, production plummeted. At the time of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it can be said that it was the most developed period of the Japanese textile industry. The number of spindles in operation in the mainland was 9,070,300, and the production of cotton yarn was 341,400 bales (400 pounds per bale). Currently, there are 13 manufacturers in the Japanese mainland with 3.5 million spindles; however, the number of spindles currently in operation is only 1.6 million. From October to December, it can be increased to 3.5 million spindles. Based on this number of spindles, 100,000 bales of cotton are required each month. The Japanese mainland does not produce cotton. Before the war, Japan imported most of its cotton from India and the United States. In Showa 12, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Japan imported 7,016,238 bales of Indian cotton. US cotton ranked second, with 4,223,964 bales. After the war, the first US cotton ship entered Japan in June. As of recently, 24 cotton ships have entered Japan, importing more than 500,000 bales of cotton. When the US cotton industry delegation arrived in Japan in March of this year, the Japanese side requested the US to import 890,000 bales of US cotton within this year. By June, it was known that the Japanese side's estimate was too large, and the Japanese manufacturers' production capacity could not digest this number, so it was changed to 314,000 bales. According to the Allied Supreme Headquarters plan, a total of 576,000 bales of US cotton can be shipped to Japan this year. At the beginning of the year, the Japanese side was very optimistic about the fiber industry, ranking the fiber industry first in the post-war economic recovery work; however, due to the shortage of labor and food, the production increase plan completely failed, and it was also restricted by the electricity supply. Other factors such as the shortage of coal and financial difficulties are also the biggest reasons for the decline of the fiber industry. The originally planned cotton consumption in August was 50,000 bales, but only 67% was consumed, totaling 33,000 bales. The consumption in September was 62,000 bales, but only 70% was consumed, totaling 40,000 bales. If this continues, it will inevitably affect the import of US cotton; the plan to export fiber products in exchange for food and other necessary materials will also be hindered. In view of this, the Japanese authorities, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, held a meeting in Osaka the previous week, attended by representatives from MacArthur's Headquarters, Japanese government officials, local authorities, ten major manufacturers, and factory managers, and passed a proposal to promote the fiber industry, requesting the government to adopt and implement it, including six articles: (1) Guarantee the fiber industry as the most important industry, and give priority to obtaining the required materials; (2) Increase the food ration for fiber industry workers; (3) Pay part of the wages with factory-made products in kind; (4) Adjust the reconstruction funds for damaged factories; (5) Establish a cotton textile production technology promotion committee. The Japanese government convened a cabinet meeting on the 11th of this month to make concrete decisions on this case. The Toyo Keizai Weekly reported that experts are currently drafting a three-year plan for the revival of the fiber industry, predicting that the production of various textiles will reach 1 billion pounds in 1948, of which cotton textiles will reach 650 million pounds, rayon textiles will be 55 million pounds, artificial wool textiles will be 35 million pounds, wool textiles will be 36 million pounds, linen textiles will be 16 million pounds, and other textiles will be 35 million pounds.

Of this production volume, 40% is for export, 40% is for domestic consumption, and the other 20% is for raw materials. According to this plan, 52% of cotton textiles will be for export and 48% for domestic consumption; however, the quantity of cotton textiles planned for export cannot fully offset the domestic consumption of cotton. According to some opinions, this ratio may be changed, the import volume will be increased to 60%, and the domestic consumption volume will be 40%, that is, the export volume will reach 400 million pounds.

During the peak period of Japanese cotton cloth exports in Showa 12, approximately 648,572,000 pounds of cotton cloth were exported. If Japan's plan is realized, it will not only be a strong competitor to the Chinese textile industry, but also greatly affect the Indian textile industry; it is possible that this plan will be realized with international monopoly capital as its backing. At the same time, Japanese fiber industry equipment is not included in the first place of compensation. Recently, it has been generally believed in Washington that Japan will fulfill its guiding task in the post-war reconstruction of East Asia.

According to a United Press report from Washington on the 20th, Dr. John Staughton, a pastor of the American Baptist Church, after inspecting various parts of the Far East and returning to the United States, said in an interview: Japan seems to be a true victor, because their work of rebuilding the country and storing food is faster than that of the Philippines and China. It can be seen that this is the general opinion of the American government and public, and it is worthy of vigilance and effort from our textile industry.

### Using Small Radio Wave Detection Machines, the Security Department Smashed a Secret Radio Station in Lane 51, Jiangning Road; One Young Man, Rong Letian, Was Arrested; The Host, Wu Zhongwei, Is Still at Large

[This newspaper news] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, together with the Jiangning Road Police Station, smashed a secret radio station on the third floor of No. 152, Lane 51, Jiangning Road (i.e., Gordon Road) on the afternoon of the 8th of this month. A young man named Rong Letian, who was responsible for sending the reports, was arrested on the spot, but the host is still at large. It is only known that he is an elderly man, nearly sixty years old, named Wu Zhongwei. It has been found that the secret radio station has been established for nearly twenty days, and even the residents in the same house have not been able to understand the details. The place is a trading company dealing in import and export, named Yongchanglong. The manager, Cen Jiesheng, a native of Guangdong, has already left Shanghai for Hong Kong. All "business" is handled by the shop assistant Li Xianting. The arrested Rong Letian is also an employee of the shop. Therefore, whether it is related to the shop is still under investigation. The details of the smashing are as follows.

In view of the seriousness of the current situation, the authorities are deeply afraid that someone will take the opportunity to use telecommunications to engage in intelligence work. Therefore, technical methods were used to test the radio waves in the laboratory. Suddenly, a special fluctuation of radio waves was discovered in the southwest. Therefore, officers were dispatched with a mobile small radio wave detection machine in the direction of this radio wave to conduct preliminary detection work using the latest scientific methods. After several days of investigation, it was found that the secret radio station was located on Jiangning Road (i.e., Gordon Road) in West Shanghai. Therefore, a large number of technicians were added to intensify the investigation on Jiangning Road. When the staff passed Lane 51, Jiangning Road, the radio waves on the detection machine suddenly became clear, confirming that the secret radio station was located in the lane. Then, they continued to measure in the lane. When they reached No. 152, the radio waves on the detection machine became very obvious. Therefore, it was determined that the secret radio station was indeed in the room. At that time, because the layout was not perfect and they were afraid of alerting the enemy, they secretly marked the outside of the house. The next day, after contacting the Jiangning Road Police Station, a uniformed colonel led 16 military police officers to surround the place in three groups, leaving one group to guard the front and back doors, and the other two groups rushed in from the front and back doors. However, the secret workers in the room were still unaware of the situation. The investigators went straight to the third floor and found a young man sitting in front of the transmitter, engaging in broadcasting work. They immediately arrested him and seized the evidence. After interrogation, the suspect's name was Rong Letian. According to his confession, a large machine and more than ten pieces of application machinery were found in the wardrobe of the pavilion on the second floor. Because it was a matter of disrupting telecommunications and engaging in intelligence work and undermining national defense construction, the people and evidence were sent to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for legal action. The authorities are now stepping up the search for the remaining accomplices in order to wipe them out and ensure the confidentiality of airborne telecommunications for national defense.

According to the Public Utilities Bureau, although the military, police, government officials, and teachers riding public vehicles in this city without tickets have been repeatedly announced to be prohibited by the military, police, and government authorities, this trend has not diminished.

### The Fuel Management Committee Does Not Intend to Supply Anthracite Coal for Winter Stoves

[Our Newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the committee has never lacked the supply of coal for public utilities, water and electricity companies, shipping companies, and other agencies. The municipal authorities' saving of electricity and limiting of electricity use is not due to a shortage of fuel, but because of the limited power generation capacity. Some users in this city waste a lot of electricity, and saving electricity is indeed necessary. The committee does not intend to supply anthracite coal for this year's winter stoves, mainly because of the shortage of anthracite coal. The committee does not have this stock of coal, and the transportation in North China is blocked, making the source of coal feel quite difficult. In the future, if the coal source is smooth or purchased from overseas, it will try to supply it as much as possible. However, priority will be given to those who need it.

### Advertising Extensively in Foreign Newspapers, Airmail Purchase Turned Out to Be a Scam, No One Accepted the Remittance, Hotel Accountant Recognized the Hidden Truth

[Our Newspaper] He Jisheng, a 36-year-old man from Anhui, rented Room 36 of the Jiahe Travel Agency on Fujian Road as a long-term room. A month ago, he suddenly had a whimsical idea and falsely claimed to have established the Da Zhonghua Company in the Da Zhong Hotel at 243 Zhongzheng Road, specializing in selling Mao Bijie, ballpoint pens, and scientific red gold rings. He entrusted people to publish large advertisements in local newspapers in Wuchang, Yuanling, and other places, attracting foreign customers with extremely low prices and airmail purchases. A remittance of more than 100,000 yuan was transferred from the Central Trust Bureau to the Da Zhong Hotel, but the accounting room refused to accept it because the Da Zhonghua Company was not established there. At the same time, letters ordering goods poured in from Hunan and other places, and the telegraph was very busy. At about 1 p.m. yesterday afternoon, He ordered his accomplice Liang Shengying (30 years old, operating a cigarette paper shop) to go to the Da Zhong Hotel to inquire about the news. He was seen through by the accountant Wang Huaitang, who handed him over to the police station. He confessed that it was all done by He Jisheng, who claimed to be the general manager. The staff member Song Yuanshan, the police chief Han Zuchen, and the plainclothes police officer Ju Xingmei rushed to the Jiahe Travel Agency to arrest He and seized a large number of foreign newspapers with advertisements, promotional materials, and envelopes and stationery printed with the words "Da Zhonghua Company", and took them to the bureau for interrogation and investigation.

### The Inside Story of Shanghai's Pickpocket Party (1)

— Huang Jiamo

Bred and Growing in the Concession Era

In recent months, the Shanghai Police Bureau has made a major determination to eliminate the "pickpocket party." Under several swift and forceful searches and arrests, more than 100 people have been caught. This pickpocket party is like a centipede clinging to the city of Shanghai. In the past concession era, the police power was controlled by foreigners. The so-called "patrol room" and the inflexibility of the police structure were the main factors that created the deeply rooted pickpocket party. The "Uncle Gang" (the nickname for the big and small bosses in the gang) relied on "Bai Xiang people" to associate with some criminal chiefs and translators in the patrol room, and they were surprisingly powerful (the insider term is "Dou De Zhuan"), fearless (the insider term is "Wen Zhao Pai Tou").

Targeting Our Fellow Countrymen

In the era when foreigners ruled the concessions, they paid the most attention to the safety and welfare of foreign expatriates. As for the interests of the Chinese people living in the concessions, they were indifferent.

The people in the "pickpocket party" were well aware of this distorted situation, so the opponents they picked pockets from and robbed were not "red hairs" or "old hairs" (both names for foreigners), but specifically targeted the pitiful "fellow countrymen". This was the main creed of the gang's activities. They were all rogues who "lacked food and clothing" anyway, so they only talked about interests and not about etiquette. Can we still blame them harshly?

This relationship of interests is very simple. If a foreigner was pickpocketed, the patrol room in charge of the area would have to handle the matter officially. As a result, those patrol chiefs, second chiefs, and third chiefs who usually sat and received peaceful salaries would have to go out to investigate and handle the case. In fact, it would be found out as soon as they investigated. At that time, in addition to secretly "vomiting out the stolen goods", they would inevitably arrest a few thieves and detain them for investigation. This would turn into stealing chickens and losing rice, which would be quite troublesome. Therefore, the people in the dark of the patrol room often "admonished" the heads of the gang, "Do not attack 'old hairs', so as not to cause suffering and trouble for everyone."

At that time, the white overseas Chinese people were not blessed with the same "immunity" rights, because the White Russian people did not have extraterritoriality, and they had not yet received the protection of the Soviet official. The pickpocket party knew the international situation well, so the White Russian people residing in the old "French Concession" also enjoyed the right to be pickpocketed like our fellow countrymen.

During the Japanese Occupation

Since the Pacific War, the Japanese pirates occupied the ruling power of the "concession," and the police government became more corrupt and dark. During the war, the pickpocket party took advantage of the chaos to fish in troubled waters and rob while the fire was burning. They really "made a lot of money every day." It was truly the most triumphant era in the half-century of the pickpocket party's activities. The British and Americans all entered concentration camps, and the enemy became the ruling class. The people in the gang recognized the enemy as the "boss" and did not dare to attack the Japanese easily. This is the pickpocket party's ability to cater to the trend, and it is the party's ability to use its adaptability to deal with the world.

The Japanese pirates have always boasted of their police government, so why did they get into a dead end after ruling the "concession"? There were indeed many deficiencies in the objective conditions. The most important reason was that there were insufficient manpower, so they had to continue to rely on the group of people left over from the "patrol room" era. This group of people colluded with the gang as usual to obtain illegal profits, and at the same time, they were unwilling to cooperate sincerely with the Japanese police government, so-called "concealing from the superiors but not from the subordinates." At the time of the war, everyone only wanted to take the opportunity to "make a fortune," and the Japanese pirates had to sigh helplessly here!

Uncle Recruits Soldiers to Open Up a Way Out

The predecessor of the Shanghai pickpocket party was the "Old Brothers Gang," which was originally a special product of Shanghai, a group of paupers, commonly known as "Bie San." This group was originally a parasitic and fallen beggar living in the city, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, wandering the streets all day long. However, the number of young and strong people in the beggar gang was increasing, and they could not bear the difficult life of begging. The "Uncle Gang" in the gang took the opportunity to recruit soldiers and horses, train this street fresh force, and became today's pickpocket party.

The pickpocket party takes the principle of taking risks as its activity. Relying on the special environment of the "concession" and the help of "co-picking brothers" (the so-called cooperative partners), they actually opened up a way out and monopolized the pickpocket market. "Black-hearted copper coins" (unjust wealth) rolled in, and the people in the gang gradually "wore silk and ate oil", and transformed themselves into one of the four people. Of course, they were very proud to see those former peers who were dressed in rags and ate cold rice. How could the beggar gang not be envious? Therefore, those beggars with "enterprising minds" also followed suit, striving for a way out. Only the old and weak who had no future were supporting the begging business.

### A List of Forced Sales Calls: 13 Telephone Numbers Actually Cost 2,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper] When moving to residential areas in this city, there are often three or two uninvited guests who drive bicycles to households with telephones in various alleys and forcibly sell "emergency telephone directories" printed with lead skin. The table is 3 inches long and 2 inches wide. It is printed in red with 13 telephone numbers of the police station and fire brigade. The thin piece actually costs 2,000 yuan. They are also aggressive, claiming to be sent by the telephone company and must be bought, etc. After reporters inquired with the telephone company, they learned that the company had never sent anyone to sell any items to users. Fortunately, telephone users should not be fooled by them. If they are found again, they can be handed over to the nearby police station for handling.

### Can the Fish Market Truck with a White Flag Be Permanently Exempt from Disputes?

This is a temporary transitional measure, and the outcome depends on the negotiations between the tricycle drivers and the truck drivers.

### The Case of the Tragic Death of Zang Da's Second Son: The Witness Safely Returned Home, the Tricycle Driver Flew to Qingdao on a Special Plane, and Once Boarded a US Warship to Identify the Murderer

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the tragic case of the rickshaw puller Zang Da's second son being shot to death, the suspect, the Spaniard Lai Luns, has been arrested and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation, but the murderer has not yet been identified. In order to investigate the truth, the US military took Liao Yuanshou, the tricycle driver who witnessed the case, away for questioning on the evening of the 14th of this month. The next day, they specially prepared a plane with number 50854 and sent personnel to accompany Liao to Qingdao to identify the American soldiers who committed the crime on various warships. On the warship numbered "863", he caught sight of a burly man, who was pointed out by Liao as the murderer. However, the soldier firmly denied it. Because of his flustered expression, he is now under thorough investigation by the US side. Liao was sent back to Shanghai on a special US plane the night before and returned home safely. Liao has also reported the case to the police station for the record yesterday.

### The Enemy Property Administration Tightens the Scope and Reduces Local Offices in Batches

Reverse Property Handling Committees Will Be Established on a Provincial Basis

The handling work of the offices and sub-offices of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui will soon be completed one after another. In order to tighten up, the bureau is preparing to reduce these offices in batches within this month after considering the situation, so as to gradually achieve the end stage.

Proposed End Principles

It is reported that the bureau has formulated the end principles for the offices and sub-offices in various provinces and cities: (1) Regarding the remaining materials, they should be sold and auctioned as soon as possible. If they have no economic value, they should be identified by local auditing, public opinion, court, and supervisory agencies, and then reported for cancellation after clarifying the responsibilities. (2) The enemy and puppet factories temporarily managed by the sub-offices will be handed over to the provincial and municipal offices for management. Those managed by the provincial and municipal offices will be handed over to the bureau for management and will be priced and sold immediately after being taken over. (3) The enemy and puppet real estate can be handed over to the local Central Trust Bureau for management. If there is no Central Trust Bureau, it can be handed over to the relevant local authorities for management and transferred to the Reverse Property Handling Committee for handling after the committee is established. (5) In terms of personnel, each sub-office should retain staff who have handled the above items and other special unfinished cases for transfer to the provincial and municipal offices for continued handling, but each office is limited to three people, and the rest will be dismissed. (6) After the files of each sub-office are closed, they can be concentrated in the provincial and municipal offices. When the provincial and municipal offices are closed, they will be concentrated in the bureau. After the closure of these sub-offices, the bureau plans to establish a reverse property handling committee on a provincial basis to continue handling the reverse property. The Jiangsu Provincial Reverse Property Handling Committee is decided to be established in Suzhou, the Zhejiang Province is established in Hangzhou, and Anhui Province is divided into two offices in Anqing and Wuhu, which can also be established within this month. The chief prosecutors of the local courts in each province will serve as the directors of the committees, and the handling bureau will send a deputy director and three to five commissioners.

### Forging of Road Bureau's Chen Bozhuang's Seal; Hangzhou Arrests Young Swindler

The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration recently cracked a case involving the private engraving of the signature seal of Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Bureau, and the forging of official documents such as the Bureau's official seal. A suspect who used these for fraudulent purposes was arrested. The Hangzhou Substation of the Bureau's Police Department discovered a suspicious young man at the station. After questioning, a forged "Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration Accountant" assignment order was found on his person, and he was immediately taken to the station for interrogation. The suspect confessed that his name was Cheng Deguang, and that he had served as a communications police chief in a certain unit, but was now unemployed. When he came to Hangzhou last month, he met his former superior, Guo Yuqin, who claimed to be the head of the Accounting Department of the Two Roads Administration. Cheng then bribed him with over 200,000 legal tender yuan to introduce him to a job. He also introduced four others, including Shi Jing, to Guo for job introductions. Guo then issued assignment orders on October 17th and claimed that he had received a telegram from Guo, who told them they could get travel expenses. Chen, the substation chief, found his words ambiguous and untrustworthy, so he sent Inspector Luo Zengji to the suspect's residence at the Central Hotel to investigate and continued to invite the four people, including Shi Jingchang, who had been introduced for work. After questioning, the four people, including Shi, realized that they had been deceived by Cheng and stated that they had paid Cheng over one million legal tender yuan. They were immediately taken to the station for further questioning. Based on the confessions, a search was conducted, and the suspect's hidden "Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration" seal and Director Chen Bozhuang's signature seal were found in a ditch next to a garbage pile at the Hangzhou Railway Station. Further interrogation revealed that the cash had been given to Guo Yuqin, who had taken it to Shanghai, but Guo's address was unknown. The Bureau's Police Department, considering the suspect's forgery of seals and fraudulent acquisition of money, detained him with the evidence and sent him to the Hangzhou District Court for legal proceedings.

### Shanghai Housing Shortage: Living Like Sardines in a Can

In Shanghai, "every inch of land is worth its weight in gold," making housing a very serious problem. Although there are many garden villas and skyscrapers that adorn this world-class metropolis, most citizens can only live in cage-like houses, not only suffering from the oppression of big and small landlords but also often quarreling with their neighbors.

Shanghai's housing problem began after the rapid increase in population. In the early days of opening the port, the concession restricted Chinese residents. In 1845, Gong Muju of the Su-Song-Tai Circuit and British Consul Balfour signed the first Land Regulations for the Concession, which stipulated that "Chinese people shall not lease or sell land or houses within the concession to Chinese people, and foreigners shall not build houses within the concession and lease them to Chinese people for residence." Originally, this was purely a piece of rural land with mud, swamps, graves, and grass huts, and there were not many residents. With the added restrictions, except for servants employed by Westerners, only a few Chinese shops supplied Westerners with daily necessities. In 1853, there were no more than 500 Chinese people in the concession. In that year, the Small Swords Society occupied Shanghai City, and residents flocked to the concession to take refuge, building temporary houses to live in. Therefore, in 1854, the number of Chinese people in the concession had increased to 20,000, and Chinese and foreigners began to live together. In July of that year, the consuls of Britain, the United States, and France re-drafted the Land Regulations, tacitly acknowledging that Chinese people could live in the concession. In 1855, the Shanghai Daotai officially announced that Chinese people would be allowed to live in the concession in the future, provided they abide by the Land Regulations and pay taxes to the Public Works Department. This was the beginning of Chinese people officially residing in the concession.

From then on, the number of Westerners coming to Shanghai increased daily, and Chinese people gradually moved into the concession, either for business convenience or because the Chinese areas were unstable. The population of the concession grew day by day. According to a previous report by the Public Works Department, from 1965 to 1935, the population of the Public Concession increased from more than 90,000 to 1.15 million. The concession authorities repeatedly expanded the area and built houses to accommodate this large population. Taking the former Public Concession as an example, in 1925, there were more than 72,000 residential buildings, 3,400 were added in 1926, and 2,400 were added in 1927. More were added in subsequent years. Many people also lived in Zhabei, Nanshi, and the nearby suburbs. However, the expansion of the urban area was subject to considerable restrictions, and the construction of houses could not increase proportionally with the population. Therefore, Shanghai's housing problem has never been reasonably resolved.

After the "August 13th" Incident, Shanghai was occupied by the enemy, leaving only a small concession. Residents of Zhabei, Nanshi, and the suburbs flocked in, and at the same time, many people from the occupied areas concentrated in Shanghai, resulting in a serious housing shortage. After the victory, the order in the recovered areas has not yet been restored, and the people who took refuge in Shanghai still have to live there. And the people who were in the rear during the war flocked to Shanghai, but many destroyed houses in the Chinese area could not be built up in a short time. The housing shortage is more serious than during the "isolated island" period. Now the world is experiencing a housing shortage, not just Shanghai. But how will Shanghai solve this housing problem for its citizens?

### Lane Houses and Western-Style Houses

The most common type of housing in Shanghai is the lane house, which evolved from old-style Chinese houses. Old-style buildings were all several rooms in a row, small ones with three rooms, large ones with five or seven rooms, and palaces with as many as thirteen rooms. Shanghai houses are modified from the old style, with living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and patios, everything that is needed, and there are separate doors for entering and exiting, forming independent units. The earliest buildings were mostly two or three buildings connected to form units, the so-called "stone gate houses." As for single buildings, they are mostly inhabited by common people in less convenient areas. There is also a type of Cantonese-style house without a patio in front, also known as "Eastern-style houses," which is not very popular.

Later, with gradual progress, lane houses also became more novel. The height increased from two to three stories. In addition to water and electricity, there were also sanitary facilities. The internal structure became more Westernized, and the appearance was more sophisticated, with English, French, Spanish, and three-dimensional styles, etc. These new-style houses are located in areas that have shifted with the expansion of the city, with a quieter environment and higher rents.

### Western-Style Residences

Western-style residences were initially limited to foreign residents. Later, many noble Chinese people also began to live in "Western-style houses." However, Chinese people's habits are ultimately different from those of Westerners, and they feel that Western-style houses have many places that are not suitable for Chinese people's use. Therefore, only a very small number of fashionable people live in them. At the same time, although they live in Western-style houses, they actually preserve many Chinese quintessences. Many wealthy businessmen buy land and build their own houses. Although the outside is Western-style, the inside has been changed to Chinese style, and even the exterior has a bit of Chinese flavor.

The earliest Western-style houses were very large, similar to Chinese houses, with large lawns and gardens. Later, the area gradually shrank. In the past, one or two acres of land would only be used to build one house, but now seven or eight houses can be built. Although this is the trend all over the world, it is also because the land price is too high.

### The Style of Western-Style Houses

Although Western-style houses are noble, people in the city have high mobility, and most of them are leased. As for building one's own house, it is often more shabby than leasing. Although you can't see anything from the outside, the interior decoration is worlds apart. The private residences of wealthy Shanghai merchants are magnificent inside, even surpassing the residences of emperors. The indoor lighting and colors are full of artistic atmosphere, the marble steps are inlaid by famous artists, the ceilings are full of colored patterns, and the walls are inlaid with wooden pieces with contrasting patterns. There are water heaters in winter and air conditioning in summer, and even dance halls, theaters, elevators, and other facilities are fully equipped. The residences of servants are beyond the reach of middle-class families.

### The Development of Residential Areas: From East to West

The Shanghai market has gradually developed from east to west. The Henan Road area was originally a ball-throwing field, but later became a bustling area. Residential areas gradually expanded westward, but only to the racecourse. In the early years of the Republic of China, Bubbling Well Road was still called New Road, and there were few houses. The only place where tourists gathered was near Zhang Garden, which was considered very far. At that time, there were wars everywhere, so more and more people moved to Shanghai with their families. The number of buildings on Yu Garden Road increased with each year, and it became the most noble residential area, replacing the old Boone Road. At that time, people called Yu Garden Road the "essence" of Shanghai, with rows of mansions, all the homes of wealthy families, which can be imagined its prosperity. When the Japanese invaders entered the concession, the western part of Shanghai suddenly became "bad land." Those living in the former Public Concession were wary and moved to better places. Thus, the former French Concession arose. Today, the area from Avenue Petain to Route Ferguson has replaced Yu Garden Road. The roads are lined with lush trees, and the roads are as smooth as mirrors, where officials and nobles come and go.

### A House in the Early Republic: Monthly Rent of Eight Yuan

In the early years of the Republic of China, renting a house in the most bustling section of the Nanshi Alley Road cost eight yuan a month, and you could get a new house with two floors, up and down. Even in the New Road area, it was only about ten yuan a month. If it was more than twenty yuan, it was considered unbearable. In the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, it was still around fifty or sixty yuan, and the key money was only one or two hundred yuan. This refers to ordinary households. In the Yu Garden Road area, where Westerners lived, most of the rents were calculated in silver dollars, and few people inquired. Moreover, without a private car, it was impossible to reach directly, and manpower was generally insufficient. Later, when public buses became available, there were occasional lane houses for rent, and more people moved in. This is roughly how the Shanghai residential area shifted from east to west.

### Cage-Like Housing: Fifteen Families Lived in One House

Shanghai has such a large population and the housing problem is so difficult to solve. To what extent has the overcrowding reached? According to the Public Works Department's household survey in 1930, there were 1,159,775 people in the concession, living on an area of 5,723 acres, with an average population density of 200 people per acre. But this is still the overall calculation, and some of the houses are used for industry and commerce. In addition, there are many wealthy merchants with large houses, and with lawns and gardens, only a few people live there. The former Public Concession Public Works Department organized a committee to investigate the living conditions. This committee submitted a report in 1937. According to the report, in the concession, there were 22,764 houses with four families living in each house, 14,028 houses with six families living in each house, and 1,305 houses with more than nine families living in each house. The most, one house, has housed 15 families.

Before the war, in the twenty-fourth and fifth years of the Republic of China, Shanghai's housing opened up a new path, developing suburban new village construction movement. At that time, the Rose Garden New Village was the largest and most perfect (see picture), but unfortunately, after the outbreak of the war, it was destroyed by artillery fire. Now that Shanghai is experiencing a severe housing shortage, why hasn't anyone advocated this movement?

### Unthinkable

It is hard to imagine how fifteen families can live in a small, single building. It really becomes a cage. A reporter from a certain newspaper calculated the distribution of a building: the living room downstairs is divided into front and rear parts, with two families living in each part; the kitchen is converted into a room, with one family living there; the front patio is covered with a shed, with one family living there; the upstairs living room is divided into front and rear parts, with two families living in each part; the pavilion room above the kitchen has one family living there; a loft is built in the sloping part of the roof ridge, with one family living there; the sun deck is covered with a shed, with one family living there; a loft is also built in the middle of the half-stairway, with one family living there; and in the corner opposite the stairway, a single bed can fit, which also counts as one family; and under the stairway, there is another family living there, for a total of twelve families. As for how a house can house fifteen families, it is really a bit "unthinkable."

Shanghai's overcrowding is indeed a major social problem, directly hindering the health and well-being of residents, shortening their lifespan, and also affecting national morals and ethics, as well as social order and tranquility. However, Shanghai citizens are very fortunate to be able to obtain even a small room. How can they calculate other things? Social progress has certainly prospered the city, but whether this is human happiness needs to be evaluated separately.

### Is Shanghai a Good Place to Live?

Since housing in Shanghai is so unreasonable and causes difficulties, why do so many people come to Shanghai in batches, which is a bit puzzling. The question is "Is Shanghai a good place to live?" This question has been used as a topic for debate twice. Once at the YMCA on April 10th of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China, and again at the Youth Middle School in June of the same year.

Looking at the Good Side

From the good side: Shanghai is the largest city in the country, and industry, culture, and transportation are all centered in Shanghai. The influence of world civilization and the infusion of science. Shanghai also gets the first taste of the trend. In terms of construction, there are neat streets and tall houses. Urban transportation is convenient, and there are many vehicles like dragons crossing the river. All material civilization is beyond the reach of other places. Even the beggars on the streets have more opportunities to receive relief from charitable organizations than in other places.

Saying it from the Opposite Side

From the opposite side: Shanghai is a small place with five million people living there, and the degree of overcrowding is equal to the extreme. The sanitation facilities have not yet reached a perfect state. Although the surface is a scene of prosperity, in fact, it is full of darkness and has become a hotbed of crime. Everywhere is a place to tempt young people to fall, and even if they are not buried in the den of demons, the spiritual pain they suffer cannot be compensated by material enjoyment.

### Towering Apartments

Shanghai is precisely constructed by these positive and negative sides. But people who come to Shanghai rarely look at it from this perspective. People who have never been there think that Shanghai is full of gold, which can be picked up everywhere. I don't know that Shanghai has thirty-three heavens and also eighteen layers of hell. The number of people stranded in Shanghai is even greater. Shanghai has the advantages of a city, but it cannot be denied that there are many stains. To maintain the status of this world-class city, how should we improve and compensate for its defects?

Shanghai land prices rise with the increase in population, which has the greatest impact on buildings. To accommodate more people on a small piece of land, we can only build skyscrapers that occupy the sky but not the land. The Park Hotel next to the racecourse, the Broadway Mansion on the Bund, and the Bank of China on the Bund can be considered skyscrapers in Shanghai. But compared with New York, they are still like a small witch meeting a big witch. Initially, these tall buildings were limited to public places such as offices and hotels. The Lou Wai Lou near the Risheng Building on the Great Road once caused a sensation. People used to climb the eight-story building of the China United Apartment Corporation on the Double Ninth Festival. Slowly, this kind of large building was used as a residence, called an apartment.

Apartments

Are all large buildings with more than three floors, each floor is divided into several houses for rent separately. Each house has a bedroom and living room, as well as a kitchen, bathroom, and storage room. Some bedrooms have several rooms, while larger ones have dining rooms, study rooms, and servant rooms. The content of apartments is different from ordinary residences. They are all large buildings made of steel and cement, with elevators and heating. The interiors of the rooms have teak furniture, mica stone fireplace mantels, and built-in wardrobes. Bathtubs, electric stoves, refrigerators, and all kinds of equipment are available. The rent includes house tax, heating, hot and cold water, and other expenses. If the number of rooms is the same, it is about one or two times more expensive than a new-style lane house.

Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, there were few high-end apartments, only on Jing'an Temple Road, Haig Road, Yu Garden Road, and Avenue Joffre. Most of the residents were foreigners, and some even refused to rent to Chinese people. From the nineteenth to the twenty-fourth year, apartment buildings sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, mostly in the western section of Avenue Joffre, near Avenue Petain, and in the western part of Shanghai. Towering buildings and pavilions rise above the clouds, fully demonstrating the vigorous development of the city.

Lane-Style Apartments

In the development of apartment buildings, there is also a type of lane-style apartment. In the new-style lane, the downstairs facing the street is used as a store, and the upper floors are converted into apartments. These apartments are mostly three-story buildings, which are actually part of the lane, and the format and capacity are the same. The equipment is slightly inferior to that of the mansion-style apartments, and the rent is also cheaper. These lane-style apartments are rare in Shanghai and are mostly located in the border area.

Building apartments can save space and increase the number of residences in prosperous cities. However, the luxurious equipment and high rents still make ordinary people flinch. If the area, size, and land price can be surveyed and the number of floors can be determined, without any waste in each house, and the equipment can be as simple as possible, the rent can be reduced so that ordinary citizens can enjoy it, which will definitely help solve the urban housing problem.

Hell in Paradise!

### Hell in Paradise: A Few Reed Mats and a Few Bundles of Straw - Poorer Than Pigs and Sheep

Exquisite bungalows and towering skyscrapers adorn this city. But on the outskirts abandoned by the city, there are still many thatched huts, which are a stark contrast to the tall buildings. These thatched huts are scattered in Yangshupu, Caojiadu, North Xinjing, Zhabei, and other areas. Looking at the life of the shantytown dwellers, it is hard to believe that in the paradise of Shanghai, there would be such a hell on earth.

Most of the shantytown dwellers have drifted from their barren hometowns to this glorious city due to the threat of severe cold. But this huge Shanghai cannot accommodate them. So, with a few reed mats and a few bundles of straw, they established their dwellings. They don't have to spend money to hire plasterers, and they don't have to consult engineers. In this five or six square foot area, which is not even shoulder-high, the whole family lives, eats, and sleeps. It goes without saying that the light is dim and the ground is damp. Once there is a strong wind and rain, living in a thatched hut is not much different from sleeping in the open.

According to a survey conducted by the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus in the 25th year of the Republic of China, there were more than 20,000 shantytown households, with about 100,000 people. Those in the concession are not included. This is a stain on the city. To solve this problem, the then municipal government established the Citizen Welfare Undertakings Management Committee to build civilian residences to help these civilians struggling for life.

### Civilian New Village

The first civilian village built was on Qimei Road, with more than 200 houses, divided into Type A and Type B. The light was sufficient and the air was well-circulated, which was a world of difference compared to the pigsty-like thatched huts. In addition, there were civilian primary schools, bathrooms, auditoriums, clinics, cooperatives, sports fields, and other facilities, which were well-planned and benefited the civilians a lot. Later, 123 acres of land were opened up on Zhongshan Road, Damuqiao, Pushan Road, and other places to build a thousand houses. Although this was achieved through the great efforts of the authorities, it was still far from the required number. Unfortunately, the artillery fire of August 13th drove the residents of the civilian new village back into the thatched huts.

### The Darlings of Heaven, the Sub-Landlords, Still Make the Third-Tier Tenants Miserable

Shanghai's population continues to increase, and the need for housing is very urgent. Many people build houses to rent out for profit. Land and houses are a commodity in Shanghai.

The properties owned by the owners are often divided into many units for rent. Each building in the lane forms a unit. Since the owners are unwilling to do this trivial work of dividing the houses like citizens, many people rent the houses and then sublet part of them to others, which gives rise to the so-called "sub-landlords" and "third-tier tenants." Initially, there were really surplus houses when subletting. In times of housing surplus, the sub-landlords often faced the risk of having to pay the rent out of their own pockets. At the same time, the tenants were of mixed quality, and some even rented houses in the name of robbery. Therefore, they were unwilling to openly post rental notices. But later, there were fewer houses and more people, and the supply fell short of demand, and the sub-landlords became the "darlings of heaven." The rent collected by the sub-landlord from a building, in addition to paying the rent and utilities to the landlord, can not only allow the sub-landlord to live for free, but also have a surplus. In the few years when Shanghai was an "isolated island," the sub-landlord's family could rely entirely on this building to solve their livelihood. The third-tier tenants aggravated the exploitation, and the landlords also suffered losses.

In a situation where the supply of houses cannot meet the demand, many strange things often happen. When the landlords see that the sub-landlords are making money, they also try to raise the rent. However, the landlord only raises the rent by five yuan, but the sub-landlord charges more than twenty yuan. The wool comes from the sheep, and the miserable ones are still the third-tier tenants. The third-tier tenants also try to become landlords, subletting the rented houses to others, which gives rise to "third-tier landlords" and "fourth-tier tenants." The most interesting thing is that a third-tier tenant built a loft in a relatively large kitchen and sublet it to a fourth-tier tenant, not only can the third-tier tenant not pay rent, but also earns more than ten yuan a month. This was in the past, and it is even more different now.

### Rent and Key Money

Although Shanghai citizens live in such cramped conditions, the burden of rent is not small. Originally, when landlords build houses, they naturally have to calculate their costs, such as land price, construction costs, equipment costs, repair insurance and other expenses, as well as depreciation reserves. Based on the capital paid, they calculate the rent to seek reasonable profits. This is the most legitimate approach. However, when supply and demand are not in harmony, the leasing relationship is not so simple.

The majority of citizens do not rent houses directly from the landlords, but rather from sub-landlords. These sub-landlords rely on the scarcity of housing to profit from it, causing citizens to pay higher rents. In the landlord's eyes, this is a loss. When one cannot find a house to rent, the landlords are naturally unwilling to easily let go of this opportunity. When renting houses directly from the landlord, one must spend an extra sum of money. In the past, it was several hundreds of yuan at the lower end, and several thousands of yuan at the higher end. After the victory, it was even calculated in "slips," and was called "key money" or "small rent." Key money was originally the name for the transfer of some non-removable decorations, etc., left by the previous tenant to the next tenant. However, often even for an empty house with nothing in it, they would demand a sum of key money from you.

Key money originally came from the relationship between the previous and next tenants, so initially it was only a transaction between tenants. The landlord would sometimes act as a "matchmaker." Later, it gradually deteriorated in quality. An empty house, even just a room, or even a non-empty one, was all considered a way to make money. Tenants occupy the house and are unwilling to give it up, and the landlord tries every possible means to force the tenant out. Thus, disputes between landlords and tenants over leasing relationships emerge endlessly. If there is a fixed-term lease, the date of expiration is the time when disputes arise. If there is no fixed-term lease, there are also cases where the tenant is asked to move out under the pretext of taking it back for self-use, or the tenant is forced to move out by raising the rent. Landlords treat tenants this way, and sub-landlords treat sub-tenants the same way.

### A Contradictory Phenomenon

It is not easy to live in Shanghai, but on the other hand, there are many empty houses waiting to be rented. The former Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement once published an accurate statistic: In 1920, empty Chinese-style houses in the settlement accounted for 0.8%, increasing to 4.1% in 1927, and 5.3% in 1934; unrented Western-style houses accounted for 2.3% in 1920, increasing to 8.2% in 1926, and 14% in 1934. Over the decades, the increase in Shanghai's population has clearly exceeded the increase in housing, so the imbalance between supply and demand is a natural phenomenon. Why are there so many empty houses unattended? It can be seen that Shanghai's housing problem is not only a matter of insufficient supply, but also a matter of uneven distribution. High rents and shocking key money force citizens to tighten their belts and live in a corner. In 1936, Mr. Pike, a former member of the Housing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, gave a speech on the housing problem, pointing out that "the decrease in citizens' income has led to an increase in the number of people living together in houses. Landlords should be urged to reduce rents so that houses are not vacant. This is the fundamental way to prosper Shanghai."

Advertisements for Key Money Are Everywhere

At present, Shanghai is facing a serious housing shortage, so there should no longer be any vacant houses. However, when we open the newspapers, advertisements for rent and key money occupy many pages every day. The Tongyu Chun Tea House on Nanjing Road is also crowded with people talking about the buying and selling of housing leases. Is it that there are no houses? However, people who have no houses to live in also have no gold bars, so they can only sigh at the "house." The Housing Leasing Committee, in order to solve the Shanghai housing shortage, has come up with many methods to make a fairer and more reasonable allocation. However, for one house, there are often more than ten times the number of people applying. Among the applicants, some of them certainly have no houses to live in, but there are also those who already live in very good houses and still come to apply. What are their intentions?

### Sassoon and Hardoon: Two Jews Who Started Their Fortunes in Real Estate

As the population of Shanghai increases and land prices soar, many merchants engage in the real estate industry. When it comes to real estate, we cannot forget these two major landlords in Shanghai, Sassoon and Hardoon. They were both British Jews who made their fortunes in real estate. They still own a lot of real estate in Shanghai today, although Hardoon has passed away long ago.

The Sassoon House, towering on the Bund of Nanjing Road, is one of the top buildings in Shanghai. This is one of Sassoon's properties. Moreover, the business he runs in Shanghai—E.D. Sassoon & Co., Ltd.—is also located inside. Other properties, such as the Hamilton House on Fuzhou Road, the Cathay Hotel, the Grosvenor House Apartments on Route Doumer, and the Embankment Building on North Suzhou Road, are all Sassoon's properties, and their value is astonishing. Sassoon was born in India. Initially, his father and uncle were merchants in Shanghai, but their scope was very small. During the Great War, the British finances were strained, and the taxes were extraordinarily heavy. Sassoon then transferred a large amount of assets to Shanghai, and became the wealthiest foreigner in Shanghai.

Sassoon had a limp in one leg and often "arrived late." He liked to have fun, and although his gait was difficult, his enthusiasm was undiminished. He is still alone and travels to Bombay, London, Canada, Hong Kong and other places every year because he has assets in various places. When he is in Shanghai, he often stays in the Cathay Hotel of the Sassoon House. His office is also located at the far eastern end of the third floor of the building, decorated in a bizarre and dazzling style. When he overlooks the ships coming and going on the Huangpu River, holding a telephone receiver, observing the changes in the times, and issuing orders, he is indeed very pleased with himself.

Hardoon, an Iraqi Jew, lost both of his parents at a young age. Due to the struggle for survival, he drifted to Shanghai alone and worked as a gatekeeper in Sassoon's house. He was appreciated by Sassoon and transferred to work in the old Sassoon & Sons Co., Ltd. At that time, Sassoon's business was mainly focused on foreign drugs (i.e., opium) and real estate. Hardoon worked inside and studied diligently. During this period, he learned a lot of business experience, which laid the foundation for his future wealth.

Hardoon was blessed by the god of wealth and won the horse racing lottery once and the Guangdong lottery once. Sassoon's trust in him also increased day by day, and he was promoted to assistant manager of the new Sassoon & Sons Co., Ltd. At that time, Hardoon had already become a British citizen and a prominent figure among the British expatriates. In addition to being Sassoon's assistant manager, he also used the funds from the lottery and the convenience of his position to purchase a large amount of property in Shanghai. Almost half of the busiest Nanjing Road was his, but when he bought it, it was still very deserted and the land price was very low. Later, Nanjing Road became a target for investment and construction, and land prices soared, and Hardoon became a mega-rich man at sea.

After Hardoon and his wife, Luo Jialing, passed away one after another, the Aili Garden was left with many adopted children. The huge amount of property left by Hardoon caused a lot of disputes. This famous garden at sea has been shrouded in a smoky atmosphere ever since, and it is no longer as quiet as it used to be.

### Answers to Readers: Legal Questions

(1) Housing Leasing

Yu Hehao asks: A lessee has leased two houses for as long as sixteen years. The houses have been badly damaged due to several wars. However, the lessee repaired them himself six years ago, but they are now even more dilapidated. The lessor, taking advantage of the prevailing "small rent" trend, intends to rebuild the houses in order to collect huge "small rent." The lessee, however, is unable to afford it. Now, regarding several legal doubts, I hope you can provide answers. (1) Does the lessee have the right to continue leasing after the houses are rebuilt? If the lessor refuses to renew the lease on the pretext of self-use, how can it be resolved legally? (2) Does the law have a similar item for collecting "small rent," and what legal means does the lessee have to prevent the lessor from collecting "small rent" under other pretexts? (3) Recently, there have been reports of measures to collect five or ten years' rent in advance. If the lessor also implements this measure, should the rent be calculated according to the standard multiple announced by the authorities? Or should it be estimated separately? (4) If the lessor does not repair the houses and lets them collapse, is it legally permissible for the lessee to repair the houses at his own expense and still pay rent according to the market price? (5) In addition to the Housing Leasing Management Committee, are there any other judicial organs that handle housing leasing disputes?

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yapu] (1) A. If the leasing relationship continues to exist, there is a right to continue leasing. B. It depends on how the lease contract is drawn up to determine. (2) There is no "small rent" item in the law. If the lessor collects "small rent," it violates the law. (3) There are no restrictions on the five- or ten-year rent measures in the law, but the lessor in your area should estimate the amount of rent based on the condition of the building. (4) Yes. (5) The Housing Leasing Management Committee has been resolved to be abolished by the Municipal Council. For housing leasing disputes, in addition to requesting mediation from the district office to which it belongs, you can file a lawsuit in court for adjudication.

(2) Property Division Dispute

Zhou Daren asks: Mr. So-and-so's wife, Ms. So-and-so, gave birth to two daughters, A and B. A is already married, and B is also married. After Mr. So-and-so died, he left behind several houses. Ms. So-and-so dotes on B and wants to divide one of the houses to B. B also said that "her father promised to give B a house when he was dying" (A did not hear Mr. So-and-so say this and fears that it is fabricated). There is no will. Now the house deeds are all in Ms. So-and-so's hands. Please answer the following questions: (1) After a woman is married, does she still have the right to inherit property? (2) If Ms. So-and-so gives the house deed to B privately without A's consent, and A denies that the house belongs to B and sues in court, can she win the case? (3) Does Ms. So-and-so have the authority to dispose of the inheritance?

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yapu] (1) Yes. (2) Whether you win or lose depends on the facts and the law. You can file a lawsuit in court for adjudication. (3) Jointly owned property must be disposed of with the consent of all joint owners.

### Why Is There a Water Outage in Beichang'an Lane?

Because the tap water pipe in our place (Beichang'an Lane, Wusong Road) suddenly cut off the water, and the expenses that should be paid have all been collected as usual. According to the bill collector: There will be a water outage for three days, which will greatly affect life. It has been a day since the water outage. What is the reason for this? It is really incomprehensible, so I hereby write to your newspaper to inquire about it, so that we can know the truth. Sincerely at your service.

### Profits Tax in the 34th Year: The Process of Chamber of Commerce Mediation; The Total Amount of 20 Billion Standards Is Pending Research; No Harassment, No Leakage, The Overall Situation Is Satisfactory

[Our Newspaper News] The simplified assessment and collection of profits tax for the 34th year has been officially launched in this city. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, representing various industrial and commercial associations in the city, has negotiated with the tax authorities. It has convened two important associations to report on the progress of the negotiations and explain the coping methods. This has been recorded twice in this newspaper. According to Mr. Pan Shihao, who participated in this matter, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has more than 200 public association member units. In the past two months, it has declared the capital, turnover, and surplus of each of its members to the association. There are 218 public association units, including more than 27,000 taxpayer units, that have declared. There are also six units of non-public association members who have applied. The total book surplus of all declaration forms is approximately 13 billion. In terms of taxpayer units, although the declarations have not been completed, there should be no major differences in the book surplus of the city's industry and commerce. Because the associations that have not made declarations are all those with simple businesses and weaker organizations, they are actually insignificant. Among the associations that have declared, some members have not yet filled out and submitted the forms. These are all members who have no surplus or are even out of business. The omissions should be limited. In the normal course of events, it is understandable, but according to the law, no matter what, the declaration form must be filled out and submitted. Those who do not have complete accounts may as well estimate and declare. It has been more than two months, but this point has not been implemented, which the person in charge is quite regretful about. The tax authorities, it is said, will severely punish these undeclared units. What the consequences will be is even more worrying.

Budget Limit

According to the precedent in the rear area and the theory of simplified assessment and collection, there must first be a specific total tax revenue budget, and then the actual standard net profit rate of each industry can be used to allocate the tax. The budget of this city must be estimated realistically, and then the allocation can be fair. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has insisted on this point, and the tax authorities in charge have gradually understood. Recently, after the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce met with Director Wang, the budget amount can be reduced to 20 billion. It is said that the original budget set by the Ministry of Finance has also been revised, but it is still far from this amount, so all parties must discuss it carefully. The review committee that will be convened will focus on this as the focus of discussion. In recent days, the Chamber of Commerce and various associations have been discussing this scope. If time permits, it is still necessary to convene various associations that have not been invited to report in person. Based on the reported results of each industry, calculating 13 billion plus 50% is only enough to approach 20 billion.

Affordability

As for whether each industry has this affordability in the current situation, it is still a question to be decided. During the 34th year, this city fell into the hands of the enemy and puppets for about eight months. After the enemy surrendered and the puppet government collapsed, the restoration work was still not rapid. After cleaning up the debris, how many industrial and commercial industries can operate with peace of mind? According to the statements made by various trade associations to the association during the declaration, such as the enemy and puppets forcing purchases, controlling management, cutting off electricity and blocking transportation, and arbitrarily collecting taxes and extorting, all are accounts of blood and tears. With the actual situation like this, the affordability can be seen. Moreover, the puppet currency was finally calculated at 200 to 1. The hidden losses have not yet recovered. The Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly told the authorities about the actual situation, and the responsible officials are also very aware of it. Therefore, Director Wang has repeatedly entrusted the Chamber of Commerce to persuade various unions to support the government's financial difficulties and help more. In the opinion of industry and commerce, industry and commerce should maintain the government, and the government should also understand the difficulties of business and give assistance. The current money supply is so tight, production loans are so difficult to obtain, and the consistent style of the Four Joint Offices and the Big Four Banks has not changed slightly. How to collect this 20 billion tax is quite a problem.

No Harassment Allowed

The purpose of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in negotiating this matter amidst great difficulties is to avoid harassment in tax collection. According to news revealed by relevant parties, many people advocate "strict investigation." And they said that those who are found to be inconsistent with the actual situation can be punished in various ways. Fortunately, the tax authorities in charge did not allow harassment, and the storm has not yet arrived. The Chamber of Commerce will send the original copies of the declaration forms sent by the various industrial associations to the Direct Tax Bureau in the next few days. The Tax Bureau will calculate the amount of tax separately according to these declaration forms and issue tax payment notices directly to each taxpayer. Taxpayers can pay the tax directly to the national treasury with this, without further investigation of the accounts. The Chamber of Commerce believes that this is an important measure to protect industry and commerce. It has been agreed upon by Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Xu Jiyin, Mr. Luo Qinghua and Director Wang Fuzhou of the Direct Tax Bureau, and there should be no changes. Based on this point, what the taxpayer pays is what the national treasury receives. Officials do not harass, and there is no leakage in the middle, which can be called clear national treasury and both sides are satisfied.

Standard Net Profit

In terms of technology, the Tax Bureau is still studying it seriously. According to the simplified assessment and collection method, there must be a standard net profit rate for each industry as a basis. Then, the amount of tax payable by each household is calculated based on the capital amount or the locked-in amount of goods. According to this method, the amount actually paid by each household will be different from the amount reported by each household. In other words, each industry should have a standard net profit rate. Within the same industry, each household shall pay tax uniformly according to this standard, based on its sales amount or capital amount. The Chamber of Commerce has compiled some information based on the declaration forms filled out and submitted by each industry and each household. However, it is planned to abandon it in the future and calculate the tax according to the amount of surplus filled out by each household. Because in the 34th year, there were puppet currency, legal currency, old capital, new capital, pre-adjustment, post-adjustment and other relationships, it is not appropriate to use the usual method to find out the sales standard, net profit rate and capital standard net profit rate.

Mission Will Be Completed

The establishment of the Tax Affairs Special Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is purely to resolve the disputes over the profits tax for the 34th year. Five people are mutually recommended from the Board of Directors to take on the task and handle everything in accordance with the policy of the elders at any time. Now that the tax affairs are coming to an end, it is said that this committee will be dissolved. Unfinished matters will be handled directly by the Board of Directors. The chairman of the committee, Mr. Luo Qinghua, is in Beijing on official business. It will be decided after Gu Shen.

### The Second Phase of Rayon Allocation Today; Knitting Factories Can Apply for Registration

The Central Trust Bureau, acting as the Government Materials and Property Committee, after allocating rayon last Thursday, the market price has fallen sharply, and the panic of shortages in the market has been resolved. Various silk weaving factories can now produce fully. The Bureau has stipulated an allocation of 1,000 cases this month. In addition to those allocated last week, there are still more than 300 cases remaining, which can be applied for by various silk weaving factories. Therefore, the Bureau has scheduled the second phase of rayon allocation today. All registered factories can apply, pay the money tomorrow, and ship the goods the day after tomorrow. The allocation price will be determined by the small group meeting this morning. In the future, the Bureau will allocate once every Monday and Thursday. The Central Trust Bureau is now processing registration procedures for rayon allocation to knitting factories.

### The Cloth Price Review Committee Is Scheduled to Meet on Thursday

The Social Bureau has approved the convening of the second "Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee" at the Bureau's conference room on the afternoon of the 24th of this month. In addition to informing the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Machine Knitting Workers' Union, the Machine Textile Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Merchants' Association, and the China Textile Corporation, etc., to send full-time members to participate in this meeting, the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council will also send people to participate at that time.

### The Financial Industry Is Uniquely Prosperous; New Listings Are Emerging One After Another

Although the city's industrial and commercial industries have not yet embarked on the road to prosperity, financial institutions have been increasing from time to time. From the 3rd of this month to the end of last week, on the banking side, there are Liangzhe Commercial Bank and Changsha Hongxing, etc. On the money shop side, there are Jincheng, Lichang, Hengfeng, and Tongde, etc. The Yuanyuan Chang Bank opened today. The address is 473 Jiangxi Middle Road. The manager is Yu Dakun. The head office is located at 42 Zhongzheng Road, Nanchang. It is reported that there are still Guongan Trust Company and Guangxin Silver Company on Wednesday and Kunming Yihua Bank, Shanghai Branch on Friday that will continue to be listed this week. Therefore, the number of exchange numbers in the clearing house will increase from 187 to 196 this month.

### More Than 400,000 Spindles in the Northeast; Half Have Been Destroyed, Most of the Machinery Has Been Moved or Burned

[Our Newspaper News] According to reliable investigation: There are a total of 19 enemy-owned textile factories of various sizes in the Northeast. There are approximately 400,000 spindles. At present, only half of them are actually usable. Most factories have been repeatedly attacked by soldiers. The machinery and equipment that have not been moved have been burned down. It is now known that Shenyang has Fengtian Textile Factory (50,815 spindles, 10,888 thread spindles, 2,000 looms), Toyo Yarn Factory (5,000 spindles), Gongtai Yarn Factory (50,400 spindles), Yamamoto Cotton Cloth Factory, Dehe Cloth Factory, Hehe Dyeing Factory, Manmeng Wool Weaving Factory, Fengtian Manufacturing Factory, and Nisshin Amami Factory, etc. There are 9 factories in total. Dalian has the Daiwa Yarn Factory. There is one factory in Quanzhou: Neiwaimian Yarn Factory (107,552 spindles, 18,752 thread spindles). There is one factory in Wafangdian: Manzhou Neiwaimian Yarn Factory. There are two factories in Liaoyang: Manzhou Textile Factory (78,700 spindles, 2,808 thread spindles, 1,045 looms), Manzhou Manufacturing Factory, etc. There is one factory in Jilin: Toyo Seima Factory. There is one factory in Harbin: Kangde Wool Factory. There are two factories in Jinzhou: Chemian Textile Factory (52,400 spindles, 2,340 looms), Manzhou Fu Textile Factory (49,520 spindles, 960 looms), etc. There is one factory in Yingkou: Yingkou Yarn Factory (55,728 spindles, 1,730 looms).

### The Tobacco Industry's Loan Has Not Been Approved, China Farmers First Handle Exchange Settlement

The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association has applied to the Central Government for an industrial loan of 15 billion yuan because the industry has been greatly affected by foreign goods. However, it has not yet been approved. It is now known that the China Farmers Bank has allowed the bank to handle the exchange settlement for tobacco leaf transportation and sales. For tobacco leaves transported from Qihan, Hankou, Guangzhou and other places to Shanghai, exchange settlement can be handled with the shipping note of each shipping company. The amount is 60% of the total value of the tobacco leaves, for a period of 15 days, with a monthly interest rate of 5%. It is reported that there have been many applications in recent days.

### There Are Not Enough Improved Silkworm Eggs; China Silkworm Is Actively Preparing

Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were originally silkworm silk production areas in my country. Before the war, the silkworm egg production in Jiangsu Province for spring use was 1.2 to 1.3 million sheets of improved varieties and about 150,000 sheets of native varieties. The autumn use improved varieties was 700,000 to 800,000 sheets. The spring use improved varieties in Zhejiang Province was 1.1 to 1.4 million sheets and about 1.5 million sheets of native varieties. The autumn use improved varieties was 1.2 million sheets. During the Anti-Japanese War, after being destroyed by the enemy and puppets, the production volume this year has dropped to 650,000 sheets in Jiangsu Province and only 50,000 sheets in Zhejiang Province. Together with 300,000 sheets imported from Japan, the total is only 1 million sheets. In order to develop silkworm silk production next year, China Silkworm will start by increasing the number of silkworm eggs. In addition to producing 250,000 sheets of new products in advance at Kunming, Caoba, and Yunnan Silkworm Industry New Life Company, which have been transported from Kunming to Shanghai for cold storage on the 18th for backup, another 750,000 sheets have been produced in various seed production fields in Jiangsu Province and 150,000 sheets in Zhejiang Province. These total 1.15 million sheets are prepared for distribution to silkworm farmers in various places during the silkworm breeding season next year. However, according to estimates by people in the industry, the demand for improved silkworm eggs for spring next year is 450,000 to 500,000 sheets in Jiangsu Province and 50,000 sheets of native varieties. The demand in Zhejiang Province is 500,000 sheets and 500,000 sheets of native varieties. If the improved varieties are used to replace the native varieties, the original quantity will still be insufficient. The authorities of China Silkworm still hope to work hard on this in order to ensure that the improved varieties are fully used in the silkworm eggs next spring, and the raw silk harvest can be increased and the quality can be improved.

### Textile Manufacturers Discuss Flat Prices; The Government Implements Supervision and Strictly Prohibits Stockpiling; Manufacturers Refer to Market Prices and Sell in Large Quantities

[Our Newspaper News] The directors of the Cotton Textile Industry Association in the six districts of the city held an informal meeting yesterday afternoon. According to a director who participated in the meeting: Their common opinion will be submitted to the Textile Management Committee when it meets today, and they do not intend to make a written request separately. His personal view on this issue is that the government should stand in the position of supervision and strictly prohibit yarn factories from stockpiling; at the same time, yarn factories should refer to market prices and supply the market in large quantities. In this way, the surge in yarn and cloth prices can be effectively curbed; even if the general prices continue to rise, the rise in yarn and cloth prices must be moderate and reasonable. It is still remembered that after the exchange rate adjustment in mid-August, prices fluctuated sharply. At this time, each factory sold 30,000 bales of yarn at a price slightly lower than the market price, and as a result, the yarn price stabilized. This is enough to prove it.

### Taiwanese Rice Is Shipped to Shanghai Continuously; There Is No Shortage of Food in This City

Since the authorities have actively dredged the source of food supply in this city, the supply is not lacking and the future is very optimistic. According to the food authorities, the food panic in this city was the most serious in summer. Later, President Zhu of the Executive Yuan sent personnel to Taiwan to negotiate the shipment of a large amount of Taiwanese rice to Shanghai. A huge amount of rice was also shipped to Shanghai from domestic Sichuan and Jiangxi provinces, Vietnam, Siam and other places, and unrestricted supply began. Since the authorities adopted this policy, the rice market has stabilized. The Taiwan province harvests three crops a year and produces a lot of rice. The state-owned China Merchants Group is assigning special ships to ship rice to Shanghai, so the citizens of this city can now be assured of food in the future. Mayor Wu has now strictly ordered that the price of medium-grade rice must not exceed 46,000 yuan.

### Kunming Resumes the Gold Market; The Old Taels Will Be Abolished from Next Month

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 20th] The Kunming Gold Industry Association, in order to avoid disturbances, had resolved to suspend the association's transactions for two weeks, from the 7th to the 19th. It has now decided to resume transactions from the 21st, only doing the morning session, and decided to abolish the old taels from November 1st and use new scales in order to unify with other countries in the league.

### Customs Task Force Established to Strengthen Anti-Smuggling Efforts

Considering the rampant smuggling activities currently, the customs authorities have decided to strengthen the powers of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Division and will establish several anti-smuggling squads. These squads will maintain close liaison with the Guard Inspection Group to achieve twice the result with half the effort in anti-smuggling operations. Furthermore, large anti-smuggling vessels ordered from the United States by the Ministry of Finance are expected to arrive in Shanghai from the US soon and will be allocated for customs use. Therefore, it is believed that the trend of smuggling can be gradually eliminated in the future.

### Woolen Textile Factories Request the Executive Headquarters to Handle Wool Raw Materials

Woolen textile factories in this city are facing a shortage of wool arrivals and are unable to increase production due to Australian restrictions on the export of wool tops. It is reported that the industry has requested the Executive Headquarters to find ways to handle raw materials on their behalf.

### Only 3 Million Dan of Domestic Cotton Available for Factories; Most Used for Household Handicrafts; Our Five-Year Plan Lags Behind India

[Our Newspaper] Economic authorities have a clear plan for the development of China's cotton textile industry. They hope that in five years, China will have seven million spindles, with each person consuming fifteen meters of cloth per year. India also has a five-year textile plan, with the goal of each person consuming thirty yards of cloth per year after five years. In comparison, China is still lagging behind. Sources told reporters that approximately 2.5 million spindles are currently in operation in China's cotton textile industry, with about 1.5 million spindles damaged and awaiting repair or awaiting operation due to insufficient electricity. In the past, British experts strongly advised China to focus on repairing old machines to save financial resources, which was truly insightful. In terms of raw materials, this year's domestic cotton harvest is 6 million dan, half of which will be consumed by handicrafts and other household uses. Therefore, only 3 million dan of domestic cotton will actually be available next year, and efforts are still needed to solve the transportation problem. The remaining shortfall will need to be supplemented by American cotton. The quality of Shaanxi cotton was excellent before the war, capable of spinning up to 42-count yarn, but due to lack of improvement during the war, the quality has deteriorated, which is worthy of our attention.

### Sales of Chinese Silk to the UK Are Under Negotiation

[Our Newspaper] According to sources, the United Kingdom may become one of China's silk markets in the future. Chinese and British business circles have recently been in contact about this. The prices offered by the UK are even higher than those offered by the US, but the quantities needed are smaller. Silk industry insiders say that about 30% of the current selling price of Chinese silk is interest from high-interest loans. If low-interest loans from the state were available, costs would be greatly reduced, and competitiveness in the international market would be relatively improved. In terms of quality, Chinese silk is still inferior to Japanese silk, which urgently needs improvement.

### Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to Close Within the Year

The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region has remitted 233 billion yuan to the national treasury to date, including about 90 billion yuan used to offset the price of cotton cloth for the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. The bureau plans to close down within this year, and all items to be sold will be processed by the end of the month.

### Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory to be Transferred to Private Management

Recently, general Western medicines on the market have suffered significant losses due to the influx of American goods. However, the sales of Western medicines produced by the German-owned Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, which we have taken over, remain strong. According to Li Juren, director of the Bayer Factory Liquidation Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, this is because Bayer has a very good reputation. Now, because the factory's closure is approaching and raw materials are limited, the Western medicines it produces are still very popular. Furthermore, half of the factory's liquidation work has been completed, and it is expected to be completed by next spring. It is reported that the government, not wanting to compete with the people for profit, will tender the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory for private operation.

### New Cigarette Tax Implemented; Manufacturers Plan to Appeal Again

Cigarette manufacturers in this city are facing increased burdens due to the implementation of the new cigarette tax rates. The Cigarette Industry Association and responsible persons from various factories are scheduled to visit the Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance this morning at 10:00 AM to inquire with Director Fang Dong about the central government's response to the various requests made by the cigarette industry in its previous petition and what relief measures will be taken. If the authorities still do not provide a concrete response, it is expected that the various Chinese cigarette merchants will face significant difficulties in the future.

### Metal Prices Increase

Recently, the ordering prices of copper, iron, and other metals from abroad have generally increased, leading to an increase in the prices of copper, brass, bronze, wrought iron products, and some hardware items in this city. However, due to the lack of improvement in actual sales of these goods, the price increase is still slight.

### US Cotton Exchange Suspends Trading; Clearing of Huge Transactions from the Last Three Days; Some Accuse Short Sellers of Manipulating the Market

[Reuters, New York, 19th] The New York, New Orleans, and Chicago cotton exchanges have all suspended trading today. According to the New York Cotton Exchange authorities, this decision was made to protect the interests of the public and the cotton exchange. Industry insiders believe that this move is intended to give brokers an opportunity to clear the huge volume of transactions from the last three days. Exchange staff were still busy this morning verifying the transactions concluded on Friday, a procedure that is usually completed by 4 or 5 PM on the same day.

[Reuters, New Orleans, 19th] Regarding the suspension of trading today, the Cotton Exchange issued the following statement: The board of directors of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange, in view of the chaotic situation in the cotton market in the past few days, unanimously decided to temporarily suspend trading on the exchange in order to clear the transactions and accounts from the past week. This measure will be of great benefit to the cotton industry in general. Rumors that some individuals have insufficient funds are exaggerated. All transactions have sufficient margin, and there are no bounced checks. The situation is expected to clear up by the end of this week, and the exchange is scheduled to resume trading on October 21st.

[Reuters, New York, 19th] The suspension of trading announced by the New York Cotton Exchange today does not seem to have caused concern among industry insiders. According to general observation, the purpose of this move is to clear the huge volume of transactions that have been concluded since Wednesday. The total number of forward cotton contracts traded in the past three days amounted to 1,748,000 bales, which is rare in recent years. However, some people are slandering the cotton exchange's suspension of trading, saying that "short sellers are suspected of manipulation." Senator Thomas said that cotton brokers and exchanges intentionally lowered market prices and demanded that federal authorities supervise the commodity market. Because other commodity prices and the cotton textile industry are in very good condition, why is cotton suddenly being hit?

### Summary of Market Conditions

Lumber

Fir continues to weaken, and Lauan prices are also soft. Currently, only Hangzhou wood prices are firm due to difficulties in arrivals.

### Economic Briefs

The Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau will soon send a special ship to purchase surplus materials from the US military in Okinawa, and is expected to depart by the end of this month. According to the bureau's statistics, the surplus materials to be received are even more than those from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, worth a total of 700 million US dollars.

China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently purchased a passenger ship from the United States, which sailed to Shanghai a few days ago and was named "Hualian". It is scheduled to sail to Tianjin within days and will regularly operate on the Shanghai-Tianjin route in the future.

According to sources from the Municipal Treasury Department, the city government's tax revenue is increasing month by month. Revenue in July was 4,798,338,000 yuan, revenue in August was 5,688,886,000 yuan, revenue in September was 7,398,338,000 yuan, and tax revenue in October is expected to exceed 8 billion yuan.

### Monthly Rubber Demand is 2,000 Tons; No Fear of Foreign Competition Currently; High Interest Rates and High Wages Hinder Development

[Our Newspaper] After the victory of the Pacific War, the supply of world rubber was thoroughly controlled by the United Rubber Committee, organized by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. Up to now, China's rubber sources have all come from transshipment through Hong Kong and have not been directly supplied by the United Committee. The Rubber Industry Association of this city has made requests to the Ministry of Economic Affairs regarding this matter. It is now known that the ministry has entrusted the association to investigate the rubber needs of Chongqing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Guangzhou in order to forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for direct negotiations with Washington. The three cities of Chongqing, Tianjin, and Shenyang have now replied to Shanghai, estimating the monthly demand to be over 2,000 tons. According to Mr. Hong Nianzu, chairman of the Rubber Industry Association of this city, there are over 50 rubber factories in this city, with over 40 joining the association; there are over 500 transport and sales firms of all sizes, with over 200 joining the association. The current prosperity of the rubber industry is temporary in nature because: (1) During the war, the people lacked goods due to Japanese control and urgently need to replenish them. The demand is also very large due to low prices. (2) Supply is insufficient. The current production volume is only half of what it was before the war. This is due to the loss of equipment during the war, current electricity restrictions, and the low efficiency of general workers. (3) Foreign goods have not arrived. Taking tires as an example, the United States used a large number of artificial tires during the war, which were of very poor quality. Currently, the natural rubber tires produced are first used domestically and there is no time for export. Foreign goods will not arrive in large quantities until the summer of next year. These factors are also sufficient to create prosperity for China's rubber industry. Looking ahead to the future of China's rubber industry, in order to achieve long-term development, in addition to political stability and transportation recovery, it is necessary to eliminate high-interest loans and strive to reduce costs through the stabilization of wages.

### The Current Status of Shanghai's Soap Manufacturing Industry

— Zhang Bo'an

Soap is a daily necessity and also a part of the oil and fat industry. It can be said that there are only two large-scale manufacturing factories in our country, one operated by foreigners and the other first operated by foreigners and then taken over by Chinese. The rest are either medium-sized manufacturing or small-scale manufacturing.

Huang Xiangmao and Gu Ben soaps are now sold in almost every corner of the country. Their success is due to one secret: decades of consistency, not just luck.

Since the victory, Xiangmao soap has not been manufactured to this day. It is said that British merchants, in view of the surging labor unrest in our country and the fact that the British economy has not yet recovered, the future of "Xiangmao" is still uncertain.

"Gu Ben", however, has never stopped manufacturing until now, but compared to before, there is a sense of the past. "Gu Ben" has two soap factories in Shanghai, one is the Xiaoshadu Road factory that is currently manufacturing every day, and the other is the Xujiahui factory. The scale of the latter can be said to be second to none in China. The Xiaoshadu Road factory has never stopped working. The Xujiahui factory was once managed by the enemy and has now been completely returned. The former's daily output is 600 to 700 boxes; the latter is more than double the former. When the two factories start working at the same time, the monthly soap production is about 50,000 to 60,000 boxes.

It is said that after the victory, foreigners came to inspect these two factories—Xiangmao and Gu Ben; Xiangmao's equipment is 15 years behind American factories, and Gu Ben is 25 years behind! But it is still unparalleled in China! Currently, the "Gu Ben" factory's daily output is 600 boxes, with only the Xiaoshadu Road factory manufacturing. It is heard that the Xujiahui factory will be able to resume work soon, but because domestic transportation is difficult and raw materials are scarce for transportation, it is questionable whether it can purchase such a large amount of oil and fat.

In the soap manufacturing industry, glycerin is the only valuable by-product. Xiangmao and Gu Ben both collect glycerin. The presence of glycerin in soap not only loses valuable by-products, but also lowers the quality of the soap.

Next, we want to talk about medium-sized soap factories. Medium-sized soap factories, such as Nanyang Soap Factory, are also a well-known brand with nearly 40 years of history, because it has achieved great success in strict production. The factory suffered severe wartime losses, but it was restored soon due to "man-made" efforts! However, the current output is only two-thirds of the current output of Wuzhou Gu Ben. Its "Nanyang Super Grade" is directly equal to Wuzhou Gu Ben, sister soap. At the same time, it produces a blue barrel soap, which is suitable for the washing and dyeing industry. Most of Shanghai's washing and dyeing industry uses its blue barrel soap. The factory's business is currently actively advancing, and it has recently been heard that it has ordered new-style soap-making machines from abroad, and production will be expanded as much as possible. Generally speaking, this brand may jump up wildly in a few years.

Such as Guanghua Soap, is also a medium-sized production, but Guanghua Soap has a very short history, but it is "catching up later", which is undeniable. The promotion methods of this Guanghua Soap can be said to be meticulous.

As for small soap factories, there are countless in Shanghai, and the competition is also very fierce, but most of them are due to weak capital. Under the dominance of large and medium-sized counterparts, operators are very careful.

Soap manufacturing industry, because it is the first daily necessity, and the second possibility of foreign goods competition is very small, so its future is relatively bright. But we hope that major factories can make their own alkali and their own soap, which is in line with the complete national goods.

### Prominent Scholars Gather in the Capital; the Academia Sinica Council Meeting Solemnly Opened Yesterday Morning; Council Chairman Zhu Jiahua Presided Over the Opening Ceremony

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The long-anticipated third meeting of the second council of the Academia Sinica finally opened solemnly at the Academia Sinica here at 9:30 AM on the 20th. Attending the meeting were Council Chairman Zhu Jiahua, Secretary Weng Wenhao, Director-General Sa Bendong, Councilors Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, Chen Yuan, Lin Kesheng, Li Shuhua, Wang Shijie, Cai Yi-sheng, Bing Zhi, Zhou Gengsheng, and others, approximately 30 people. Party and government leaders who attended included Yu Youren, Zhou Zhongyue, Wu Dingchang, Bai Chongxi, Jiang Menglin, Chen Lifu, Hong Lanyou, and others. Council Chairman Zhu Jiahua served as chairman. After performing the ceremonial rites, the chairman delivered the opening speech, briefly describing the difficulties encountered by our scientific community during the Anti-Japanese War, and the efforts that should be made in the future to adapt to the requirements of the times. He encouraged colleagues to adopt practical methods, make major decisions, and seek the true and universal development of science, and determined that when the Supreme National Defense Council held its meeting, it decided that scientific research should account for a certain percentage of the entire national budget, so that research work could enter a new stage. Then, Secretary-General Wu Dingchang read the chairman's exhortation, earnestly instructing that without science, there would be no national defense, and encouraging efforts to explore in order to catch up. After reading, President Yu Youren delivered a speech, expressing his great comfort to the academic researchers who, during the Anti-Japanese War, continued their research tirelessly in the difficult environment of repeated relocations, in a spirit similar to that of the ancient sages who "did not change their joy even in adversity". He also said that the difficult period had now passed, and the establishment of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People still awaited the efforts of scientists across the country. The government would not only return politics to the people, but also determined to "return science to the scientists", hoping to complete this arduous task and jointly build a new China and a new world. Then, Vice President Zhou Zhongyue was invited to deliver a speech, briefly stating that the present is the atomic age, and if we want to create a new world culture, research tools must be complete and funding must be increased so that we can engage in specialized research to increase human well-being and maintain world peace. After the speech, Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi was invited to speak. Mr. Bai first quoted Chairman Chiang's words, saying that without science, there would be no national defense, and that modern national defense needed science extremely at the present stage in order to seek self-defense and maintain world peace. The era of meat bombs and broadswords in the past has passed, and we should prepare as soon as possible to catch up. He hoped that scientists could cooperate with the Ministry of National Defense. Mr. Bai also announced that the authorities had decided to use 2% of the Ministry of National Defense's budget for scientific research. After Mr. Bai's speech, Secretary-General Wu spoke on behalf of Hong Lanyou, and Minister of Organization Chen Lifu spoke successively. Mr. Chen believed that the current research work only had an upper layer and no lower layer, which was a defect. He hoped that it could be popularized in the future, and that every school and every factory could have research institutes. If the lower layer is sound, the upper layer will inevitably be sound. He hoped that there would be no reluctance to spend money on scientific research, that external liaison should be strengthened, and that attention should be paid to cultivating talents and not pouring cold water on young people. Finally, Hu Shi delivered a reply on behalf of the councilors. Mr. Hu loudly appealed and spoke passionately, saying that if the government could give us ten years of stability, and if the government and society could give us sufficient financial resources, then our colleagues would be able to achieve something within ten years, at least to establish a PhD research institute. The opening ceremony was completed amidst warm applause at around 12:00 noon. Afterwards, a group photo was taken for commemoration. According to Director-General Sa Bendong, in addition to the doctoral degree awarding case, the issue of how to strengthen the organization of the council will also be discussed at this conference. To date, the council has received approximately 20 proposals.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of Education invited Dr. Pei Fei, an expert in international courses, to hold a meeting at the Ministry of Education yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Attending the meeting were Director Zhou Hongjing of the Ministry of Education and more than ten experts from various universities in economics, politics, law, history, geography, and other subjects related to international courses. Dr. Pei Fei reported: "Regarding international courses, Columbia University in the United States once led more than ten Chinese students to specialize in research. This research is related to economics, history, and society, so research takes these three aspects as the research center. During the Anti-Japanese War, China was affected by the situation, and the level of Chinese students declined, which should be improved in the future. The United States also has entrance exams for foreign students. The level of students' international cultural exchange should be improved." Director Zhou reported on the curriculum settings for the first, second, and third grades of Chinese universities. Courses related to international courses are all designated as required courses, and elective courses are only available after the third grade.

It is heard that Dr. Pei Fei is scheduled to go to Beiping on the 21st, stay in Beiping for about three weeks, and then go to Wuhan.

### The Crowd Sound Team Triumphs This Morning; Defeated Huasheng Again Last Night, Hasty End to the Game, Numerous Fouls, Greatly Reduced Excitement

[Report from this Newspaper] The Crowd Sound Basketball Team is scheduled to return to the Philippines by plane at 5:30 this morning. Although Wu Shaoshu, Vice President of the Sports Association, tried his best to persuade them to stay, the players have been in Shanghai for more than a month and are eager to return home. The team originally agreed to have a performance match with the Conquest team after finishing the game with Huasheng last night, but unfortunately this did not happen. The team exchanged photos and pennants with the Conquest team as a memento.

Great Disappointment

Last night's game against Huasheng saw the Crowd Sound team win again, with a final score of 42 to 28. In the first half, Crowd Sound took the lead with 28 to 14 points. The Municipal Gymnasium was packed, but unfortunately last night, due to an excessive desire to win, the Huasheng side committed numerous fouls, resulting in a complete lack of excitement. In the second half, Huasheng was left with only three players due to fouls, unable to substitute, and the game ended hastily, leaving the audience greatly disappointed. The total number of fouls committed by both sides reached as many as 53 times.

Free Throw Scores

The Crowd Sound team still fielded their five tigers, the Chen brothers, Cai, and Yang. Huasheng responded with Fu Jinsheng, Wang Youcai, Wang Hongbin, Liu Xueqi, and Wang Kanruo. The referees were Qu Honglu, Zheng Zhifang, and Wang Hongbin. Wang Hongbin committed the first foul, Yang Renhui missed the free throw, Wang Kanruo violated the rules again, and Cai Wenzhang scored one point, opening the scoring. The Jin brothers, Jin Zhi and Jin De, scored every time they shot, leading 10 to 1. At that time, referee Qu Honglu's glasses were broken by the ball, and Liu Hesheng substituted him to continue the game. The first quarter ended 18 to 5. In the next exchange, Guo Jinming replaced Liu Xueqi, and Jin De added to the score, making it 21 to 5. Wang Youcai made a long shot, opening the scoring record for the Shanghai team. Wang Hongbin was fouled out five times, and Liu Xueqi re-entered the game, but it did not help the situation. Crowd Sound was like entering an unmanned territory, while Huasheng committed more and more fouls. Xueqi was also fouled out, and the score was 28 to 14, completing the second quarter.

Three Players in the Game

In the second half, the battle resumed, with the score at 32 to 14. Wang Kanruo was fouled out again, and Yin Huanwen replaced him, but the situation remained one-sided. The score in the third quarter was 37 to 1. In the final quarter, the number of fouls increased even further. Ultimately, Huasheng had only three players left to play. At this time, Crowd Sound also had no intention of fighting, and simply passed the ball to each other to finish the game. The final score was 42 to 28.

### Farewell Commemorative Performance Match: Italian Overseas Chinese Lost to the Mixed Team, Unfamiliar Skills Result in a Score of 3-0

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was a clear autumn day. The Italian Overseas Chinese Football Team played a farewell match in Shanghai against the Chinese Mixed Team. Football fans flocked to the scene, with a total of no less than four to five thousand people in attendance. The Mixed Army's composition was based on the principle of selecting those who were recently familiar with football matters. Therefore, the selection target was based on the results of the Small Ball League as a sample. However, yesterday, Yan Shixin, Fei Chunhua, Han Longhai, and Li Yao were mistakenly absent. Fortunately, the new forces arrived completely, and Gu Yiche, Zhao Yongfang, Wu Kaimin, and Lei Shuping were replaced. As a result of the match, the Mixed Army still won by a large margin of 3 to 0, with the first half ending 1 to 0.

Willing but Unable

The Italian Overseas Chinese were willing but unable, and the players generally had a pale complexion, indicating insufficient nutrition recently. Although the forwards of the Mixed Team were gathered from various teams, the three young players, Gu Yiche, Lei Shuping, and Gao Xiuqing, all showed normal conditions. In particular, Gu Yiche's performance was the most brilliant. Although it was not immediately clear how hard Jia Youliang worked on the right wing, the first and second goals scored were both created by Youliang's passes, making his contribution undeniable. The defense was led by Meng Yiliang, Qu Yongfu, and Zhang Gen, who were very organized.

One Goal Ahead

The match was delayed until 3:10 PM due to the late arrival of the Mixed Team members. The referee was Wu Shouheng. As the battle unfolded, both sides showed unfamiliarity, with very little brilliance. Until 25 minutes into the game, Gao Xiuqing received a pass from Meng Yiliang and passed it to Jia Youliang. Youliang skillfully delivered it to an opening, Luo Xulai blocked the air, Lei Shuping darted in and blocked it, and McNeady was unable to save it. The first half ended with the Mixed Team leading 1 to 0.

Three Goals in a Row

After the break, the competition resumed. The Italian Overseas Chinese were determined to counterattack, but unfortunately, they did not succeed. After four minutes, the Mixed Team suddenly became active. Lei Shuping grabbed the ball and passed it to Youliang. Youliang dribbled one step forward, and the five forwards advanced. Jia passed it to the right with one foot, Lei deliberately created an opening, and Gao Xiuqing arrived with the ball, scoring a clear and beautiful goal. After the goal, although the Italian Overseas Chinese frequently counterattacked, the Mixed Team tried their best to defend and did not succeed. In the 34th minute, Wu Kaimin broke through the empty goal in the crowd again. Not a minute later, the whistle sounded long, and the Mixed Team defeated the Italian Overseas Chinese by a score of 3 to 0. In yesterday's match, the two armies agreed to kick each half for 35 minutes each.

### Correction of Errors in the New Household Registration Law: Ministry of the Interior Telegraphed to Various Agencies for Verification

It is now heard that the Ministry of the Interior has discovered errors in the above two laws: (1) Article 8 of the Household Registration Law Implementing Regulations, the word "book" in the phrase "Registration Book for Mobile Population" is a mistake for the word "register". (2) Article 20 of the revised Household Registration Law, the phrase "birth and discovery of abandoned children" and Article 20, Paragraph 4 of the Household Registration Law Implementing Regulations, the word "self" in the phrase "adopted children and their own parents" are both mistakes for the word "birth". (3) Article 21, Paragraph 2 of the Household Registration Law Implementing Regulations, the word "book" in the phrase "registration book involving more than two types of the same event" is a mistake for the word "person". The Ministry of the Interior has also stated that when various places handle national identity cards in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Household Registration Law, the word "part" in "identity card" is often mistakenly written as "copy", which is obviously inconsistent with the provisions of that article and should be corrected uniformly to avoid discrepancies, and telegraphed for verification and correction.

### The Young Detachment is Strong: The Melody of the Jining Campaign

—A Fengzhen Air Report on the 5th, Special Correspondent Liu Yingyuan of this Newspaper

The [Young] Detachment suffered some losses due to the capture of Zhuozi Mountain, so it was originally planned to serve as a reserve force for the attack on Jining this time. On the morning of the 10th, when the city was suddenly attacked, the "Yellow River" Detachment once entered Qiaoxi. Because the follow-up troops did not follow, it suffered a setback and withdrew to the north of Luotuozi to confront the Communists. At this time, the only National Army force outside Jining was a "Young" Detachment, covering the attacking troops in the southwestern suburbs of Jining. At 1:00 PM on the same day, the Communist Army's field force reinforced from the south launched a fierce attack on the "Young" Detachment. What was discovered during the day was the Independent Brigade, and after dark, the 358th Brigade also joined the battle. After seven rounds of tug-of-war, the Communists never broke through the "Young" Detachment's position.

On the morning of the 11th, the Communist Army's outer forces all reached the rear of the National Army's attacking forces. During the day, in addition to consolidating Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, our side also divided two branches to counterattack outwards. The "Young" Detachment detoured to the south from the left wing, approaching the mountains near Suji Station and occupying Madeqingdi. The "Yellow River" Detachment rushed north from the right wing towards Baishitou. The Communist Army did not carry out a fierce resistance that day, but instead directed the outer forces straight to the west, circling around and crossing the railway line, spreading to the banks of the Bawang River, forming a larger encirclement. Before sunset, our counterattacking forces did not dare to continue to penetrate deeply, and immediately ordered the troops to withdraw and build fortifications in the original position belonging to Huangjialiang. Waiting for the Communist Army's fierce attack to preserve the already consolidated position of the "Victory" Detachment on Tiejun and Wolong Mountains.

After dark, the Communist Army's outer forces completely returned, and then used the main force to attack the Huangjialiang position of our "Young" Detachment. They broke through Houjia Village, reached Luotuozi, and bombarded the "Young" Detachment command post in Bianjia Village. The "Lijin" Column's command post was also affected and subsequently moved to Tiejun Mountain, joining the "Victory" Detachment. At this time, the "Yellow River" Detachment was confronting the Communist Army on the right wing. The Liang and Zhang Battalions of the "Young" Detachment were subjected to a wave-like encirclement by more than five brigades of the Communist Army. Although the Communist Army launched eight fierce attacks with a company as the unit, the "Young" Detachment never gave up Huangjialiang and continued to support it until dawn on the 12th.

The Night of Critical Situation

On the night of the 10th, the situation of the National Army was the most dangerous. The troops attacking the city did not enter the city, and the covering reserve forces were heavily surrounded by the Communist Army. The reinforcing "Tangsheng" Column was still in the Liangcheng area, more than 200 miles away from Jining. After the Communist Army broke through the Houjia Village defense line and reached Luotuozi, the directly subordinate small capital team of the "Lijin" Column became chaotic, and the defeated soldiers even affected the position of the "Yellow River" Detachment. Some even retreated to the Dichengzi area. When the "Young" Detachment command post was attacked, the Chief of Staff and Adjutant were seriously injured. The Detachment Commander commanded a small unit, holding two battalions and resisting the Communist Army. At the same time, contact was lost with the "Lijin" Headquarters, causing the highest commander of the "Lijin" Column to enter the position of the "Victory" Detachment on Tiejun Mountain, less than three miles away from Jining City.

On this night, the Communist Army in Jining City counterattacked Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, and several times rushed to the vicinity of the bunkers, all of which were suppressed by our heavy firepower. At that time, in Huangjialiang, the "Young" Detachment had less than 600 people capable of fighting. Except for the north, where the "Victory" Detachment on the Wolong and Tiejun Mountains above could be responded to with signal flares, the remaining east, west, and south sides were surrounded by the Communist Army. The Communist Army launched a fierce attack with a company as the unit. After the first company was almost completely killed or injured, the second company continued to rush up, creating a situation where it was impossible to win and impossible to defend. In the end, the troops and us were mixed together,抢砲 and夺枪 each other. The "Young" Detachment had a heavy machine gun that was taken away by the Communist Army. The shooter ignored pulling the fire and used a grenade instead of an iron hammer to smash the enemy's head before taking back the machine gun. From this, it can be seen what a dangerous situation the battle entered on the night of the 11th.

That night, the Communist Army made a major mistake in its command. If they had not surrounded the position of the "Young" Detachment after breaking through Houjia Village and reaching Luotuozi, but had directly attacked Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, and at the same time夹出 the "Victory" Detachment with the Communist Army guarding the city, leaving only a small part to contain the "Young" Detachment, it would have bestowed an unimaginable encounter on the National Army. But they did not do so, but focused on annihilating the "Young" Detachment; unexpectedly, they encountered the "Young" Detachment's calm response, wasting a large amount of the Communist Army's manpower and firepower. If it had not been for the resolute resistance of the "Young" Detachment, the arrival of reinforcements on the afternoon of the 12th would not have been able to save the critical situation of the outer Jining battle. Therefore, the "Young" Detachment was awarded the championship of various departments in the 12th War Zone in the Jining Campaign.

Help Came From Heaven

After dawn on the 12th, the situation of the National Army's outer encirclement had gradually improved. Because the Communist Army suffered very heavy casualties on the night of the 11th, after dawn the next day, the area around the position of the "Young" Detachment was covered with corpses wearing gray military uniforms. There were about 7,800 of them, but the situation was still critical before the reinforcements arrived. The courageous commander of the "Lijin" Headquarters did not wait for the reinforcements to die at that time, and let the "Victory" Detachment attack the city bravely. At the same time, he transferred the "Young" Detachment to Wolong Mountain and the "Yellow River" Detachment to Tiejun Mountain for defense, to build a small defense line. When the reinforcements arrived, the "Victory" Detachment had already broken into the city and controlled most of Qiaoxi.

The reinforcing "Guoguang" Detachment was ordered to depart from Zhuozi Mountain on the night of the 11th, and fought a field battle station by station with the Communist Army along the railway line. They fought while running, and arrived in the suburbs of Jining at 3:00 PM. They fired two cannons first 20 miles away, both hitting the Communist Army's position outside Jining, and the Communist Army immediately panicked. Zhuozi Mountain is 180 miles away from Jining, and the Communist Army sent out three brigades to obstruct the advance of our reinforcements. According to the Communist Army's estimation, the National Army's reinforcements would not arrive until the morning of the 13th at the earliest, and the Communist Army could annihilate all the National Army attacking the city on the night of the 12th. Unexpectedly, the "Guoguang" Detachment arrived at 4:00 PM on the 12th, running all the way. Therefore, the Communist Army believed that the National Army's rescue soldiers flew from heaven. At that time, the Communist Army's good dream was shattered by the two cannons of the "Guoguang" Detachment, and their morale suddenly plummeted, and the formation showed signs of shaking.

After the "Guoguang" Detachment arrived, the "Victory" Detachment was encouraged by the excitement, and before dark, they captured several strongholds in Jining Qiaoxi. The stubborn Communist Army was still unwilling at this time, trying to make a final struggle. Therefore, after dark, the Communist Army's outer forces attacked the position of the "Guoguang" Detachment, and the command post was also attacked. That night, the Communist Army's wave-like charge reached as many as seven times, and in the end, the Communist Army's last burst of energy was extinguished by the firepower of the "Guoguang" Detachment. On the 13th, while our army continued to expand its battle results in the city, it drew out the "Yellow River" Detachment and the "Guoguang" Detachment to completely disperse the Communist Army in the Luotuozi area. Extending until sunset, the Communist Army's garrison troops were completely driven out of Jining by the National Army.

### Gruesome Street Fights

Breakthrough at the Southwest Corner

On the morning of the 12th, at 7:00 AM, Liu, the commander of the "Victory" detachment, after entrusting the positions on Iron Army and Wolong Mountains to the "Yellow River" and "Youth" detachments for defense, led the second and third battalions to attack the southwest corner of Jining City under orders. At this time, the "Yellow River" and "Youth" detachments, in addition to dealing with the enemy on the periphery, also had to cover the "Victory" detachment's attack on the city, a considerably heavy task. In this battle of Jining, the National Army did not have new-style weapons. Our main tactic was to use heavy machine guns to suppress the Communist army, preventing them from raising their heads, and then send engineers to detonate the enemy's defenses with explosives. The two barracks outside the southwest corner of Jining City and the Gospel Hall south of the city were captured quickly and successively using this tactic, relying on soldiers who were not afraid of sacrifice. When breaking through the southwest corner, howitzers were concentrated on a single point to shatter the city wall, and the fallen wall was used to obscure the [illegible character]. Although the enemy had formed a crossfire network within the city to seal the breach, it could not stop our soldiers from charging in with machine guns. As soon as the thunderous artillery fire stopped, a cloud of yellow dust rose from the southwest corner of Jining City. When the dust was blown away by the wind, four or five courtyards were already flying the bright red national flag. When we first entered the southwest corner, there were only two companies, less than two hundred men. Taking advantage of the smoke and dust, they sent a company to seize the flour company near the South Gate. A battalion of enemies guarding the flour company were stunned by the shouts of the National Army, and the sixth company of the third battalion of the "Victory" detachment calmly jumped over the wall.

After the infantry controlled seven or eight courtyards in the southwest corner of the city, artillery carriages followed them in. The Communist army's machine gun bullets struck the artillery shields and fell to the ground. The most miraculous sight on the morning of the 12th was the appearance of more than a hundred ammunition-laden carts, which arrived in the city only ten minutes after the breakthrough at the southwest corner, seemingly from nowhere. Like a mighty cavalry and chariot force, the enemy thought many National Army troops had entered the city. This caused the Communist army entrenched in houses to abandon their positions and flee, vacating many defensible courtyards for the National Army. At this time, many Communist soldiers threw their guns into the street and raised their hands in surrender.

Attack on the Post and Telegraph Office

After the National Army broke through the southwest corner, order within the city was briefly disrupted. Later, the Communist army headquarters sent an enforcement team to supervise the battle. Anyone running from the southwest, whether National Army or Communist army, was indiscriminately sprayed with machine gun fire. Political personnel spread favorable rumors to consolidate the wavering morale. Subsequently, the street fighting in the city evolved into a struggle for houses. Most Communist soldiers, under the supervision of political personnel, did not dare to surrender their weapons. They were mostly sealed off in their houses by the National Army with machine guns covering doors and windows, and then killed by hand grenades thrown down the chimneys. When the war ended and the battlefield was cleared, we found seven or eight corpses in each house.

Shortly after the "Victory" detachment entered the southwest corner of Jining, the "Yellow River" detachment also broke through the West Gate, pinning down the Communist army west of the bridge in various strongholds, awaiting their beating. The enemy west of the bridge had several important strongholds, including the Post and Telegraph Office, Yao Zhe's headquarters, the police station, and the Mengjiang Bank. The "Victory" detachment first attacked the Post and Telegraph Office. Four heavy machine guns were placed on the roof of the post office, controlling the main road and the exits of various streets and lanes. Because Liu, the commander of the "Victory" detachment, was very familiar with the terrain inside Jining City, he directed engineers to break through various houses, ordering artillery carriages to be pulled to an alley directly facing the Post and Telegraph Office, and conducted guided fire from a distance of two hundred meters. At the same time, he contacted the artillery on Iron Army Mountain by telephone to also fire at the smoky area. As a result, the Post and Telegraph Office was abandoned after being hit by seven artillery shells.

Each street corner in Jining City was equipped with hidden bunkers. After the "Victory" detachment occupied the Post and Telegraph Office, they used two heavy machine guns captured from the enemy to suppress the firepower from the east side of the bridge from the upper floor of the Post and Telegraph Office, while ordering infantry to climb onto the hidden bunkers and throw hand grenades into the firing ports, killing all the Communist soldiers inside to clear the corridors. Consequently, most of the National Army's attacking soldiers suffered hand and leg injuries. After the National Army cleared the main road in front of the Post and Telegraph Office, they set up howitzers at the intersection of the main road and North Street, bombarding Yao Zhe's headquarters on the east side of North Street. As soon as the shells stopped exploding in the headquarters compound, the comrades of the "Victory" detachment, like divine soldiers, leaped out of the shops across the street and raised the national flag on the roof of the house where Yao Zhe usually resided.

Communist Army Counterattacks on Two Fronts

When we occupied the Post and Telegraph Office and were besieging Yao Zhe's headquarters, the Communist army defending the city dispatched two regiments to counterattack. One regiment bypassed the West Gate from the railway fence north of the city, attacking the National Army; the other regiment attacked the Qingzhen Temple near the South Gate from the tunnel fence south of the city. At that time, we had very few troops in the city. The combined forces on Wolong and Iron Army Mountains were still confronting the enemy's outer forces. The troops in the city had to defend the acquired strongholds on the one hand, and continue to expand the battle results on the other. Therefore, our tactic for dealing with the Communist army's counterattack was not to meet them head-on, but to cut them off in the middle, preventing them from advancing too far.

In the first phase, the Communist army's two counterattacking units successfully recaptured the Qingzhen Temple near the West Gate and the South Gate. In the second phase, because we also dispatched two units to occupy the two railway fences, cutting off their retreat. Later, after the artillery fire of the "Guoguang" detachment was heard, we transferred the first battalion of the "Victory" detachment from outside the city, and parts of the "Youth" and "Yellow River" detachments to assist in the battle, and recaptured the West Gate and the Qingzhen Temple. We destroyed the Communist army's headquarters, and they retreated to the line of Mengjiang Bank and the police station to resist. Yao Zhe personally supervised the battle and launched a second counterattack. Therefore, the West Gate and the Qingzhen Temple were contested several times, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. The National Army even used the corpses of Communist soldiers to build meat bags for combat.

Before dark, we successively recovered the West Gate and the Qingzhen Temple. The Communist army built positions at the Mengjiang Bank, the northern railway fence, the police academy, the water tower, the railway station and other places, and confronted the National Army. That night, the outer war was still fierce. The Communist army in the city suffered heavy casualties during the day, and the soldiers dispatched lay on the ground and dared not move forward. The National Army only heard gunshots in the distance, and no Communist army was found near the strongholds. At the same time, we encircled the east side of the bridge with lightly armed units, so the Communist army could not take care of both the east and west sides of the bridge. Originally, the Communist army could have taken advantage of the night to recapture the lost strongholds, but because the morale was extremely low and the commander could not supervise the soldiers, they failed to reverse the critical situation in Jining.

The Last Day of Destiny

September 13th was the last day the Communist army occupied Jining. In the morning, the Communist army's outer array was disordered. We transferred most of the troops from the "Youth" and "Yellow River" detachments into the city to consolidate the strongholds, and ordered the "Victory" detachment to continue attacking the strongholds. Before sunset, the police academy, the Mengjiang Bank, and the northern railway fence were captured, and the west side of the bridge was completely occupied. On this day, the Communist army still tried to break free and resisted fiercely. Especially at noon, in order to wait for the darkness to retreat, they launched even more ferocious counterattacks. The garrison of each house, under the supervision of Communist Party members, would never give up easily unless they were completely killed by the National Army. According to the common people, in several courtyards, the soldiers killed the party members before retreating.

In the Battle of Jining, many Communist soldiers showed extreme tenacity. The squad guarding the railway station water tower, equipped with two light machine guns, supported the west side of the bridge from morning to dusk on the 13th, preventing the National Army from smoothly entering the east side of the bridge through the railway. More than two hundred people were killed or injured. When it was almost dark, we used many artillery shells to shoot into the windows, killing the Communist army inside. This water tower was more than four meters high and was completely made of reinforced concrete. It required precise shooting to hit the windows. In the entire Battle of Jining, the dozen or so Communist soldiers guarding the water tower showed the most stubborn resistance.

Tiger Mountain, the most famous mountain in Jining, did not play an important role in this battle. Originally, on the morning of the 13th, when the street fighting in the city was fierce, most of the guard battalion of the "Sui-Mongolian Military Region" withdrew from Tiger Mountain and was captured from behind by a small number of people sent by the "Victory" detachment. They saw that Tiger Mountain had fallen and that the situation was gone, so they only resisted at the railway station, the railway hospital, the locomotive yard and other places for two or three hours. After the National Army broke through these strongholds, at 11:00 PM, the Communist army launched a fierce counterattack. After that, we felt that the sound of gunfire was sparse. When we arrived at the power company and the county government, there was no one. Only then did we know that the Communist army used the tactic of fierce attack and rapid retreat, escaping in small groups.

### Jining Pursuit Battle

After the Communist army collapsed on the night of September 13th, they retreated in three directions. The troops of the "Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region" retreated from Xinghe to Chaigoubao, the troops of the "Jin-Sui Military Region" retreated from Liangcheng to Zuoyun, and the troops of the "Sui-Mongolian Military Region" retreated to Fengzhen first, and then turned to Zuoyun to join the troops of the "Jin-Sui Military Region". The Communist army's civilian personnel and the gold, silver, opium, and cloth plundered from the people were moved to the mountains of Yanbei as early as after the fall of Zhuozi Mountain, and the grain was stored in shops and farmers' homes near Jining. They claimed that this was a strategic retreat, and if the people handed over the items deposited by the Communist army to the National Army, they would be severely retaliated against. Therefore, in the Battle of Jining, the National Army did not receive other materials except for the weapons captured, which were nearly two brigades' worth of equipment.

Communist Army Retreat Directions

During this Communist army rout, most of the strongmen drafted in Suidong and Chaharbei abandoned their weapons and fled home. The strongmen in the area of [illegible character]bei went up the mountains to become bandits, hoping that the National Army would send people to recruit them. Most of the strongmen near Hebei and Wutai were able to retreat with the army, but it was very chaotic. Only Nie Rongzhen's basic troops and He Long's 358th Brigade marched in four columns to the southeast and northwest. They had covering troops resisting the National Army stubbornly on both wings, letting the wounded walk in front, and the light machine gunners walked behind while fighting. If the National Army's pursuing troops were too small, they could turn around and counterattack. Therefore, our pursuing cavalry specialized in intercepting these two troops. As a result, they charged in a chaotic manner.

The Communist army usually conducted two types of education for soldiers: never surrender, and never lose your gun. Political personnel spread propaganda that the National Army treated prisoners of war particularly cruelly, killing them using various terrifying methods, and stipulated that anyone who lost their weapons would be killed without exception. If a soldier surrendered, his family members would also be severely punished. The pursuing troops discovered many Communist soldiers who committed suicide by pulling the fuse of hand grenades under their heads after being surrounded, never surrendering their guns to us while alive. Sometimes they would put down their guns and wait for our soldiers to go to inspect them, then use hand grenades to die together. Therefore, when the National Army encountered the Communist army, the soldiers did not listen to the orders of their officers and swept them with machine guns. Therefore, fewer of the defeated Communist army were captured alive by us than were killed by us.

Iron Cavalry Charges Wildly

The "Revival" Column placed the "Iron Cavalry" Detachment southwest of the railway line and the "Green Mountain" Detachment northeast of the railway line as the outermost patrol units of the Jining [illegible character]. The "Iron Cavalry" Detachment moved back and forth between Liangcheng and Jining like lightning, making it difficult for the Communist army to grasp their movements. Wherever they went, they would encounter the "Iron Cavalry." On September 5th, the Communist army reinforcing Zhuozi Mountain and retreating from Zhuozi Mountain gathered in the Niujia Chuan area south of Zhuozi Mountain, attempting to retreat to Liangcheng. Unexpectedly, they were surrounded by the "Iron Cavalry" in Wulichang. After an hour of battle, the enemy was completely crushed, more than 300 people were killed, more than 200 people were captured, and the rest were scattered in the mountains and fields.

On the 13th, when the Communist army retreated from Jining, the "Iron Cavalry" transferred from Liangcheng to Sanyitang, more than 20 miles west of the city, on the afternoon of the 12th. On the morning of the 14th, the "Iron Cavalry" set off from Hulu Satai near Sanyangtang, pursuing the Communist army on the road to Liangcheng, specializing in attacking the 358th Brigade. They chased for fifty miles and dispersed the 6th and 8th Regiments of the 358th Brigade in Mamitu, which belonged to Fengzhen County. In this battle, more than 300 people were killed, more than 100 people were captured, and the captured spoils included 200 rifles, as well as multiple 60mm mortars and Russian-style light machine guns. The enforcement battalion commander of the 358th Brigade, the political commissar of the 8th Regiment, and the commander of the 6th Regiment were killed by the hooves of the "Iron Cavalry" horses, and the latter was wounded by a saber. Our cavalry fired from horseback, as brave as the Cossack cavalry of Russia. The Communist army slandered us, saying that there were Americans participating.

After the "Iron Cavalry" dispersed the 358th Brigade, on the morning of the 18th, they eliminated more than 200 remaining members of the Communist army's "Sui-Mongolian Military Region" Cavalry Brigade led by Kang Jianmin at the Xin'anzhuang Lian Station, and took the opportunity to recover Fengzhen County. They also successively recovered strongholds such as Longshengzhuang, and arrived at Xinghe County on the afternoon of the 19th. Xinghe County was first entered by the "Great Wall" Detachment of the "Revival" Column. The Communist army found that there were very few people, so they transferred two regiments from the "4th Military Sub-district of Jin-Cha-Ji" to counterattack from Chaigoubao. Unexpectedly, the "Iron Cavalry" and "Green Mountain" Detachments arrived one after another during the day on the 29th, so on the night of the 29th, the Communist army's two regiments were completely surrounded by the "Iron Cavalry" and "Green Mountain" on the outskirts of Xinghe City. They either surrendered or died, and no one ran back to Chaigoubao.

Green Mountain: The Wind Howls, the Cranes Cry

The "Green Mountain" Detachment departed from Wuchuan on September 30th, and arrived on the outskirts of Jining City on the day the "Youth" Detachment attacked Zhuozi Mountain. The "Green Mountain" Detachment focused on annihilating the Communist army's only cavalry, the Kang Jianmin Brigade of the "Sui-Mongolian Military Region." On the night of the 5th, they defeated a regiment of Kang Jianmin at Datuchengzi, 25 miles north of Jining City. Later, two regiments were transferred to reinforce the counterattack, but they were also defeated by the "Green Mountain" Detachment. By dark on the 7th, the "Green Mountain" Detachment had arrived in the Beiyingzi and Tanmi areas on the outskirts of Jining City. That night, the commander of the "Revival" Column personally commanded the "Green Mountain" Detachment to launch eight fierce attacks on the Jining City wall, once breaking into the northwest city and attacking the Communist army's rear.

During the Battle of Jining, the Green Mountain Detachment operated in the northeastern suburbs of Jining City. After the Communist army collapsed on the night of the 13th, the "Green Mountain" Detachment was responsible for pursuing the retreating Communist army north of the railway line. That night, the troops of the "Jin-Ji-Cha Military Region" were dispersed in the Laopingdiquan and Rose Camp areas. The strangest thing was that there were more than 1,500 Communist troops stationed in the Laocaoquan area. They did not know that Jining had fallen, and as a result, they were driven away by more than 300 people from the Second Battalion of the "Youth" Detachment. On the morning of the 14th, the "Green Mountain" Detachment found Nie Rongzhen's main force in Honghaizi and surrounded two regiments of the Communist army, killing more than 500 people, capturing 300 people, and seizing more than 400 various guns. The remaining Communist army went to Mopan Mountain and escaped. Afterwards, the "Green Mountain" Detachment searched south along the railway and joined forces with Ma Zhanshan's troops from Datong at Baoziwan on the afternoon of the 18th.

People's Anger in Suidong

The Communist Party's administrative personnel in Sui had already buried very deep hatred in the people's [illegible character] sinews. In the past, because the rule was extremely strict, they did not dare to express resistance. This time, after the Communist army collapsed in Jining, they vented their nameless anger on the strongmen coerced by the Communist army. This evolved into very cruel mutual killings among the peasants. Our administrative personnel could not think of an effective way to stop this anger of the common people. A total of 80,000 people from the Communist army participated in the Battle of Jining. 20,000 were killed by the National Army, 15,000 were injured, 5,000 surrendered, and 20,000 escaped to Zuoyun and Chaigoubao. The remaining more than 20,000 people, accounting for more than a quarter of the total force, were completely eliminated by the people of Suidong.

Most of the Communist army that had been scattered by the National Army left their units and spread into the villages. The people of Suidong are particularly tough. In the past, they produced great bandits such as Lu Zhankui and Su Yusheng. Therefore, seeing that the Communist army's situation was gone, they all rose up to "take advantage of the fire to rob." The Communist army conducted four nocturnal battles in Jining, and most of them were exhausted and their horses were exhausted. Furthermore, they were chased by cavalry, spitting blood from their mouths and noses. Every time they arrived at a place, they would fall asleep with their heads covered, and the common people took this opportunity to seize their guns. In order to silence them and [illegible character] in the future, few Communist soldiers who lost their guns were able to survive. Most of them were strangled to death with ropes by the common people and buried in the mountains. Some of the porters carrying the wounded also killed the wounded with stones in order to reduce the burden, and then dropped their stretchers and fled.

The people's revenge actions against the Communist army were partly due to anger, and partly due to the need for self-defense. Originally, the self-defense strength of the people of Suidong was quite sufficient. In the 25th year, when the Japanese and puppet troops in Chaharbei attacked Honggeertu and Tumuerte, the defending troops mainly relied on the militia to repel the Japanese invaders. After the Anti-Japanese War, more than 10,000 cavalry were established in the five counties of Suidong alone. Later, the Japanese and puppets collected all the guns owned by the people, and they obeyed the Communist army when they came. This time, the Communist army failed, so there was no reason not to seize their guns. It is difficult to investigate the weapons left by the Communist army to the people. We only know that the returning troops of Fengzhen increased from 200 guns to 2,000 guns after the Battle of Jining. Furthermore, the price of guns in Fengzhen was half the price of Gui Sui.

### A Glimpse of the National Army's Life on the Banks of the Songhua River - Image Description

An army from the southwest corner (Yunnan) – the 60th Army of the Army – has travelled all the way to the distant Northeast to take over, disregarding glory and fatigue. It once showed its skills in the great victory of Taierzhuang, and a division of Japanese invaders was wiped out by them. Later, they fought in the battles of western Hunan and southern Jiangxi. After the victory, they were ordered to go overseas to show their power, and were responsible for accepting surrender in Haiphong.

Leading this elite army is General Zeng Zesheng, a battle-hardened hero of the Anti-Japanese War. His subordinates have maintained a fine tradition, received good training, and fought courageous battles.

What is shown here is only a small part of their life, but at least it can reflect a glimpse of the National Army's life.

### Outstanding Construction in Taiwan Province: The Chianan Irrigation System, a Water Conservancy Project

— Taipei Air Dispatch on the 16th, by Special Correspondent Mu Yun of this Newspaper

How great is water conservancy! Overflowing, it nurtures all things. — Chen Yi

The Chianan Irrigation System, a representative work of water conservancy in Taiwan Province, is worthy of introduction to the mainland. The origin of water conservancy projects in Taiwan Province did not begin with the Japanese, who ruled for fifty-one years. As early as the seventeenth year of the Daoguang era, Cao Jin, the magistrate of Fengshan County (now Kaohsiung County), witnessed the suffering of the people in Kaohsiung and Fengshan counties due to the lack of water conservancy. He dredged the Xiadanshui River, and after four years, the old canal, stretching for five li, was completed. Later, it was extended from sixteen kilometers to thirty-two kilometers, and the irrigated rice paddies expanded from thirty-six thousand mu to sixty-seven thousand mu. To commemorate his achievements, later generations named the dyke "Cao Gong Canal."

On the way to Ershui, this reporter visited the Lin Gong Shrine. It is said that Lin Gong was a water conservancy expert in the Taichung area. After completing the construction during the Qing Dynasty, this person disappeared. At the time, only his surname Lin was known, so the Lin Gong Temple was built to commemorate this deity.

Therefore, when discussing water conservancy, people should mention the Chianan Irrigation System, but they must not forget that it is simply an expansion of our ancient methods.

Ten Years of Construction

How much effort the Japanese put into Taiwan is understood in general terms by those who first arrived in the province. Taking the Chianan Irrigation System as an example, construction began in September of the ninth year of the Republic of China, costing a total of 42 million yen. Due to financial difficulties, the project was delayed three times, and the cost increased to over 54.13 million yen (26 million was borne by the government, and the remainder was distributed among local assembly members). The construction period was also extended by ten years.

In addition to strengthening agricultural irrigation and increasing the production of the colony of Taiwan, this great water conservancy project also had political significance. Naturally, they aimed to win the hearts of the people in the southern plains through construction.

Chief Executive Chen Yi made a special trip to inspect the system on the seventh of this month. Witnessing this great project, he wrote the phrase "How great is water conservancy! Overflowing, it nurtures all things." The Jinghu-Pingkun reporter group, during their important visit, included the Chianan Irrigation System in their itinerary, in addition to Sun Moon Lake. This clearly shows that it has attracted attention from all sides! Chief Executive Chen deeply feels that the current issue is how to complete the construction that the Japanese were unable to finish, in order to gain the trust of the people. The problem is that the majority of people are "numb and apathetic"!

Employees

The Chianan Irrigation System covers nine districts of Tainan County and the two cities of Tainan and Chiayi. Within this vast area, there are over 150,000 households and one million people. The irrigated farmland directly benefiting from the system amounts to 2.3 million mu. This will be the sole economic value of the system.

This area is divided into water supply zones of approximately 2,300 mu each. Within each water supply zone, there are small water supply canals and small drainage canals, rationally maintaining the distribution and management of the canal water. Each water supply zone is divided into three smaller zones: one for summer rice cultivation, one for dry-season autumn and winter sugarcane cultivation, and one for miscellaneous crops. A three-year rotation system is adopted to economically and effectively regulate the water supply.

The Water Conservancy Section of the Construction Bureau of the Tainan County Government and the Chianan Irrigation Association are under the jurisdiction of the government. However, due to the vast scope and complexity of the affairs, a separate headquarters has been established, with over 100,000 members (including landowners and tenant farmers). There are currently 1,150 employees handling business, supervision, irrigation, and the maintenance of drainage and protective structures for waterways.

Concrete Construction

The water source of the Chianan Irrigation System, like the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant, is the Wushantou Reservoir, with an elevation of 66 meters. It utilizes natural valleys to form a coral-like shape, with a water storage area of 11,000,000 square feet, an effective storage capacity of 660 million cubic feet, and a water depth of up to 160 feet. The maximum water intake is 1,800 cubic feet per second. This uses a spiral-type water gate made of reinforced concrete to regulate and draw water from the Zengwen River. Below the weir dam at an elevation of 220 feet (56 meters), there is a water delivery tower with a flow rate of one to two and a half feet per second. The river water passes through a tunnel extending 3,108 meters and then flows along the 28-li main line, branching out into 300-li secondary canals and 1,850-li small irrigation channels.

Outside the reservoir, there are also intakes on the left bank of the Zhuoshui River, including the Linnei First, Second, and Zhongguozhi intakes, located below the bank protection of the river. The function of the Chianan Irrigation System is not only to draw water but also to drain water. It has 1,740 li of drainage channels. To prevent floods, tides, and disasters, it has 83 li of embankments, 170 li of dedicated telephone lines, and short-distance railways.

The entire project is constructed entirely of concrete and natural cobblestones. Standing on the weir dam beside the reservoir and looking out over the fertile Tainan Plain, one cannot help but admire the greatness of human engineering. Combined with the distribution of electricity, this area can be said to have achieved industrialized agriculture in the countryside. The livelihoods of millions of farmers, the prosperity or decline of the entire province's agricultural economy, and the allocation of food are all tied to this!

Expanding Water Sources

The budget for the 34th year of the Republic of China was 48,176,243 yuan for both revenue and expenditure. The supplementary budget was 23,138,970 yuan for both revenue and expenditure. The entire revenue department consists of irrigation rent and maintenance fees, with ordinary water rent at 420 yuan per year and special water rent at 17 yuan, totaling an income of 80 million yuan. In the 35th year, the planned repair engineering fee for the association is 7.83 million yuan, and the disaster recovery engineering fee allocated by the Relief Administration and other agencies is 12.89 million yuan. This restoration project includes expanding the weir dam and repairing drainage channels. According to their report, the original planned irrigation area was 2.3 million mu (150,000 chia), but in the 27th year, the actual irrigated farmland was only slightly over 2.9 million mu (the rice harvest in the 34th year was 39,281,300 jin, with an average yield of 2,100 jin per 15 mu). If this expansion plan is completed, the reservoir's storage capacity can be increased by one-eleventh, allowing all water-deficient farmland to be irrigated!

However, considering the total area of the Southern Plain, the irrigable farmland that the Chianan Irrigation System can supply only accounts for one-third of the total (with one rice crop every three years in a rotation system). Therefore, the people of the county are also requesting the use of the reservoir formed by a major earthquake in the Caoling area. The Tainan County Government has specifically budgeted 1.5 million yuan this year for the survey of this project and has sent personnel to manage the weir dam. This naturally formed large reservoir saves a great deal of construction costs, but because it is naturally formed, it contains various vulnerabilities and requires technical review. There is still much work to be done!

Regarding this irrigation system, this reporter has some feelings. Why can't agriculture in the mainland (and even the Jiangnan region) actively produce, and instead allow wastelands and disasters to occur due to drought and floods? The water conservancy project in Taiwan Province serves as a profound lesson!

### Late Autumn in Changchun

— Air dispatch on the 9th, by Shenyang-based Correspondent Zhao Zhan of this Newspaper

The willows sway gently, the sky is clear and blue, and the late autumn in Changchun is still very lovely. However, when the northeasterly winds and sand rise, it shows that autumn is about to end, and people are about to hibernate in the long cold winter.

Between war and peace, people want to seek a definitive answer, but the question is not easy to answer. This winter has come early, especially in Rehe, where the climate is already very cold. The climate of tall autumn and stout horses can no longer be used. The battles around Chifeng are fierce, and soldiers coming from the south are already accustomed to fighting in the icy and snowy conditions. The National Army wants to seize Chifeng and eliminate the Communist forces within Rehe. The military says that this is an easy task. The "spark" ignited by the Communist forces in Liaobei shows a tendency to expand, and its effect is clearly to echo the flames of war in Rehe. From Zhangjiakou to the northeast, through Weichang, Chifeng, Kailu, Beilu to Harbin, a line is extended, linking major and minor battles together. This winter in the Northeast is greatly not peaceful. The Songhua River water may flow quietly. We boldly predict that the Songhua River will freeze in a stalemate. The Communist forces are still preparing to withdraw from Harbin to Jiamusi. General Du Yuming calmly said: Whether the Northeast is stable depends on the actions of the Communist forces.

The war has destroyed the countryside, conscripting men and requisitioning military grain. Farmers groan under the heavy burden. Strong men have left the countryside, and the lack of rural labor has greatly reduced grain production. The capital that farmers recover from the land cannot balance the ever-rising prices, which determines the tragic fate of the farmers. They utter painful cries for help after a victorious autumn harvest. According to statistics from the Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, 3 million farmers need urgent relief, and 150,000 refugees have no clothes or food. The number may be even higher in the Communist areas. This year, farmers will spend a desperate winter.

Production and Construction

### Opening of the National Products Exhibition Market

— Editor

The National Products Exhibition Market, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association and others, has recently opened. Although the scope and layout may not be considered grand or perfect, the fact that such a market has appeared at a time when national product manufacturers are facing extremely difficult conditions can at least be said to be a major event since the victory.

In European and American countries, there are many precedents for national product exhibitions. In the past, Britain had the British Industries Fair, and Germany held a grand exhibition in Leipzig every year. Their scale, scope, and the precision of their displays and layouts can be said to be grand events held annually.

However, the meaning is exactly the same as that of the National Products Exhibition Market. That is to arouse the interest, belief, and recognition of the people in national products, thereby creating a psychology, which is the slogan formulated by the National Products Promotion Movement: "Using national products is the most glorious thing."

This writer believes that this exhibition should have a dual meaning. On the producer side, it can be used as a starting point to promote and improve their products. On the consumer side, it can determine the direction of consumption and use the money of Chinese people to cultivate the industries of Chinese people. In this way, with the close cooperation between production and sales, the future of national products will be bright and promising.

### Research on Factory Locations

— Yan Bingying

It is very clear that various industries tend to concentrate in one or two places. For example, the textile and footwear industries in the United States are famous industries in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Connecticut has long been the leader in the copper industry, and Pennsylvania is the leader in the carpet industry. However, conversely, industries can also gradually move from one place to another. This is, of course, mostly due to population changes. For example, after the United States developed domestically, its industrial center gradually moved westward, according to the census at the end of 1920, until it reached the vicinity of Whitehall in southwestern Indiana, which is an example. In addition to this general trend of movement, an entire industry can also move from one place to another due to various economic circumstances. For example, several manufacturing industries that originally developed in the New England States are now almost completely leaving New England because the economic relations of raw materials and markets make these industries more profitable in the western states.

Three Factory Needs: Market, Raw Materials, Labor

However, there are also several states that developed first, which, although they do not have raw materials, are still able to maintain several industries very firmly and are strong competitors with states that not only have sufficient raw materials but also have the same, if not better, transportation facilities to transport manufactured goods. Examples include the textile industry in New England, the jewelry industry in Rhode Island, and the copper industry in Connecticut. Therefore, the geographical trend of industrial centers is indeed an important factor in selecting industrial locations, and it is worth paying attention to this factor when planning a new industry or planning to move an old industry.

Using a Jeep to drive a threshing machine (Sent by special correspondent for the New York Times)

There are obviously many complex reasons why industries concentrate in certain places. The most important of these are proximity to the market, proximity to raw materials, a sufficient supply of labor, and low capacity costs (either due to proximity to waterfalls or cheap fuel, etc.).

Among the above reasons, the first two are of course the most important, because without raw materials, goods cannot be manufactured, and without a market, manufacturing is useless. In addition, in relatively small areas, this reason is often the most important factor in the problem of selecting industrial locations. Assuming that other conditions are exactly the same, the location of various industries should always be chosen in places close to the market, because the occurrence of an industry is either due to the market's need for it, or due to the entrepreneur's efforts to create this need. Second, the distance from the place of origin of raw materials often has a significant impact, so the result is that a harmonious solution must be sought between the two. However, these two factors are often influenced by transportation issues. For example, if most of a raw material is turned into waste during the manufacturing process, it would be too uneconomical for the manufacturer to transport this raw material from a distant place. Therefore, some industries, such as the paper industry, which needs to rely on forest products, must be located near forests, and the packaging industry must be near the center of the livestock industry, and the pottery industry must be near places with clay. Conversely, although the places of origin of wool in the United States are all in the western states, it seems more economical to manufacture wool fabrics on the Atlantic coast. These are all related to the convenience or inconvenience of transportation. Also, once a copper mine is mined, its ore must be dissolved near the mine, because it is impossible to transport this kind of thing to a distant place. However, the places that produce copper, such as Montana, after melting the copper ore into copper bars, can economically transport the copper bars to Connecticut, make various utensils, and then repeatedly transport the copper utensils needed by Montana back to the state. However, we must also know that if the transportation problem is not very important economically, then the impact of the distance between the market and the source of raw materials is not very important. In other words, if transportation costs are very low, then the last two influences, labor and capacity, or any one of the two, can become important factors, and products and raw materials can be economically transported back and forth over extremely large distances, and occupy a superior position in the market. However, this is also very rare. Any one of the above reasons can independently determine the location of an industry. They often combine with other reasons to have an impact; therefore, when we decide on an industrial location, we must study it in detail. What we need to know now is only that the two influences of labor and capacity can also affect the industrial locations determined by the ordinary factors mentioned above in a larger area.

The Environment is Changing

In general, the economic environment in which an industry occurs can often change. This situation is especially obvious in newly developing countries such as the United States. Therefore, if this change is relatively large, the developed industry can also be affected and move to a very distant place. Conversely, various industries are often deeply rooted and flourish in one place, even though the economic environment in that place has long been unfavorable to that industry. These characteristics that cause the developed industry to stay in one place are of course caused by many influences, and one of the most important of these is the supply of labor. Because it takes a long time to create an industrial society, and after this society is created, they cannot be moved as easily as machines. As for skilled workers, generally speaking, they are unwilling to leave their hometowns easily unless they have relatively high wages. Even if they have high wages, they sometimes feel dissatisfied with the new environment, and are easily disappointed, and immediately want to return to their hometown. Therefore, if an industry has flourished in one place, it must have developed a characteristic at the same time, and it is not easy to move. For example, many industries in New England were just accidental opportunities when they first occurred. After these industries have developed, other similar industries, either separated or concurrently operated, have also developed accordingly; therefore, the specialization effect also develops auxiliary or affiliated industries, and much local capital is also invested in it, and the influence of these characteristics is enough to offset the shortcomings of other economic benefits. Therefore, although most of the economic benefits of developing these businesses in New England have moved to other states, these businesses are still firmly occupying a leading position in their original place of origin. Second, the general public's belief in an industry often tends towards the place where it was originally developed, which is of course another driving force to increase industrial characteristics.

Packaging and Transportation

Issue Seven of Production Organizations

After the goods are manufactured, the issue of packaging must be considered, because without packaging, they cannot be sold or transported to various places.

The word "packaging" includes two types of packaging: one is the packaging that contains the goods, usually called decoration. Decoration has a great relationship with the sale of goods, because it is the appearance of the goods. Even if the quality of the goods is very good, but without beautiful decoration, the general public will definitely doubt whether the quality of the goods is reliable after all. Therefore, general manufacturers are very particular about the decoration of goods and must ask experts to design it.

The design of the decoration of goods is no less important than the design of the goods themselves. Sometimes we can also use our decoration to attract customers.

In addition to this decoration, there is also a layer of packaging for transportation, which is packaging such as wooden boxes.

If the cost of the wooden box is calculated separately, then it does not need to be included in the cost of the goods. If it is included and cannot be calculated separately, then it should be included in the cost of the goods.

The packaging problem is worthy of study, and making the packaging meet the standards can really be said to be an art, because effective packaging must be able to meet the following conditions:

(1) The goods packed are fully protected and can resist all external vibrations and damages during transportation.

(2) The cost of packaging must be reasonable and not too high.

(3) The weight of the packaging must not be too heavy, so as not to increase transportation costs.

(4) There must be sufficient padding inside the packaging to prevent the goods from being broken or cracked.

(5) The time required to manufacture the packaging must be as short as possible.

(6) The size of the packaging should be convenient for transportation. If several goods can use similar packaging, then it will be more economical.

A manufacturing plant spends a very considerable amount on packaging every year, so the packaging aspect must be studied. We cannot use flimsy packaging to save costs, nor can we increase the burden on the goods solely for the sake of sturdiness. Here, we can divide the disadvantages of flimsy packaging and too sturdy packaging as follows:

1. Flimsy packaging:

a. Causes damage to the goods.

b. Causes the goods to be lost or dispersed during transit.

c. Causes disputes with customers.

d. Causes the trouble of correspondence and negotiations.

e. Requires more time for transportation.

f. Causes losses from returns.

g. Causes accounts to be delayed and not collected in time.

h. Increases transportation costs.

2. Too sturdy packaging:

a. Increases packaging costs.

b. Causes more space to be occupied due to the thicker wood used.

c. Increases transportation costs due to increased weight.

Spring and Autumn

### Memoir of a Peddler of Ink

— Bao Yu

In the spring of a certain year, I was traveling from Tunxi to work in a guerrilla zone. Because it was necessary to pass through an occupied area, I was worried about trouble from the enemy. A friend suggested, "The ink from Tunxi is very famous. Carry some with you. In the occupied zone, you can pretend to be an ink merchant as a cover, and you can sell it to brush and ink shops to earn a little money, which can be helpful." I immediately adopted this suggestion.

We all know that the "Hu Kaiwen" ink from Huizhou is famous, but all the ink shops seen on the streets of Tunxi displayed the "Hu Kaiwen" sign, just like "Lu Gaojian" in Suzhou and "Zhang Xiaoquan" in Hangzhou. At the time, I couldn't distinguish between genuine and fake, so I just chose a "Lao Hu Kaiwen" store with a relatively blurred sign and went inside.

Inside, in the window, were displayed all kinds of ink sticks. Some looked like the thick black batons carried by policemen, tied with red tassels hanging there; some were like the slender charcoal sticks used by women for eyebrow drawing, placed in exquisite boxes; some were sculpted into the shape of graceful and slender ladies; some were sculpted into round cakes. All of them were decorated with gold, or red and green patterns and characters, which were very beautiful.

However, these kinds of ink can only be used as "refined people's" toys. I didn't dare to buy them because there weren't many "refined people." In order to consider the sales, I only bought more than ten catties of ordinary, commonly used ink. This was bought with money taken from the travel expenses.

More than ten catties of stuff, carried in a hand that couldn't even restrain a chicken, felt quite strenuous. I barely managed to carry it onto a passenger boat.

About a dozen miles from Tunxi, there was a tax checkpoint. The boat docked, and two inspectors came aboard. They found my more than ten catties of ink and asked for my tax certificate. I was confused and took out the invoice that the ink shop had given me.

"What is this?!" They threw the invoice onto the deck.

"I don't have a tax certificate!"

"How can you do business without paying taxes? You are clearly evading taxes and will be fined!" The inspector put on a stern face.

As a result, I was fined a sum of money.

From Tunxi to the market, I was inspected many times along the way, which was already quite troublesome. Then, from the market to Hangzhou, there were more than a dozen checkpoints set up by puppet police. Many fierce puppet police officers, feeling the heavy things in my bag, insisted that I unpack it. When I opened the bag and the ink was exposed, they still deliberately made things difficult and insisted on receiving money before allowing me to pass. This happened at more than a dozen checkpoints, and I had to pay money at each one. By the time I arrived in Hangzhou, there was no travel money left. On the one hand, I was anxious, and on the other hand, I still had a glimmer of hope: as long as I could sell the ink and raise the price a little, then the travel expenses to my destination would still be enough.

Thinking this, I carried the bag of ink and looked for brush and ink shops. As a "virgin merchant," I shyly went to the shops, always hesitating at the door for a long time before finally going inside. When I mentioned that I had ink to sell, some of them said:

"Now is not like before, the sales of brush and ink have decreased. Almost everyone uses fountain pens and Western ink..."

Some looked at my ink and said, "Fake Hu Kaiwen," and walked away without saying a second word.

I walked many miles on the streets of Hangzhou and entered many brush and ink shops, but in the end, not a single ink stick was sold.

In wartime, merchants are the darlings of the era. Look at who is doing business and not making money. But I only bought a dozen catties of ink, and as a result, not only did I not sell it, but I also had to pay fines and lose money. Is the fate of a poor scholar really so bitter? As I walked along the West Lake, I complained to the blue West Lake.

Complaining is not a solution, so I hardened my heart and went to find a relative I didn't usually want to see. He used to be a teacher but changed careers to become a businessman.

"Brother, you only know how to write articles and don't know the difficulty of doing business! Hahaha... This little ink is only worth two thousand yuan. You should keep it for writing articles!" Since he understood my situation, he ridiculed me as much as possible. What could I say? I could only endure it painfully.

I borrowed some money, took the ink, and arrived at my destination. "Although the business lost money, I am grateful that the title of "ink peddler" allowed me to pass smoothly in front of the enemy." Thinking this, I felt somewhat comforted.

After that, I continued to move to several regions. Apart from giving some ink as gifts to a few friends, I still had a few catties left with me. Every time I passed through an occupied area, I always acted as an "ink peddler." These strips of black ink became my talisman. Even now, although things have changed, there is still some ink left. In my spare time, I take them out and look at the golden characters inscribed on them, such as "Orchid Smoke," "Dragon Gate," and "Five Catty Oil," and recall the past, and I feel a kind of indescribable feeling.

### On He Tianjian's Landscape Paintings from the Perspective of Chinese Painting Creation

— Shi Chongpeng

Critics say that Chinese painting has been the same for thousands of years, without any change, copying and imitating, again and again, without any creative spirit. This is really a great injustice to Chinese painting because painting itself is the expression of human creative spirit, especially Chinese painting. For example, what did the paintings of the Three Dynasties, Qin, and Han look like? From where did they come to imitate? What did the paintings of the Jin and Tang dynasties look like? From where did they come to imitate? What did the paintings of the Five Dynasties, the Two Song Dynasties, and even the Yuan Dynasty look like? From where did they come to imitate? The painters of the Ming and Qing dynasties liked to imitate the works of ancient people, seeking to be exactly like them, believing that they could also cultivate their nature and emotions. Moreover, they mixed in a reverence for the past; over time, it became a habit, and the spirit of painting creation greatly declined. Even well-known figures like Tang Yin and Dong Qichang also created imitations of "imitating the brushwork of the Song and Yuan dynasties" or "learning from the Dong and Ju styles." It is no wonder that the works of the Four Wangs and Wu Li are so familiar that not a single one is not an imitation! Moreover, they always use the same composition of overlapping rivers and stacked peaks, thousands of hills and myriad valleys, which makes people tired of seeing them and gives them a monotonous and bland feeling. Although a few painters such as Bada Shanren, Shitao, and Shixi could sweep away habits and fully express their creative spirit, they were not noticed at the time.

The composition of Chinese painting, whether it is figures, landscapes, or even flowers and birds, is mostly woven from the interlacing of dots and lines. Figure painting has various line drawing methods, the so-called "iron wire drawing," "floating silk drawing," "olive drawing," etc., eighteen methods; landscape has dozens of kinds of "hemp fiber texture," "unraveling rope texture," "lotus leaf effect," etc.; flower painting has "double hook" and "boneless" methods, etc. These methods have been studied by countless painters for thousands of years. Modern painters born thousands of years later can certainly use them as references. Using these ready-made methods to create new painting artistic conceptions and new brush and ink changes can be developed and utilized by everyone's intelligence and wisdom. If we can do this, it is creation, and we can open up new paths. Therefore, Bada Shanren and Shitao also used the methods of dots, lines, drawing, and texture of ancient people before creating. It is just like the meaning that after the works of Zuo Qiuming and Sima Qian, there were the articles of Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi. Although the structure is the same, the thoughts and temperament are different.

The painter He Tianjian from Liangxi, he uses the methods of dots, lines, drawing, and texture of the ancients to create his own works. He has extracted the essence from the works of the Five Dynasties, the Two Song Dynasties, and the Yuan Dynasty, creating masterpieces. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, he cut off all social engagements and painted behind closed doors, accumulating more than two hundred exquisite works. The author has read them one by one. The greatness of the momentum is like Jing Hao and Guan Tong, the depth of the hills and valleys is vaguely like Fan Kuan and Li Cheng, and the elegance of the brush and ink rivals Ni Zan and Huang Gongwang, bringing together the great achievements of famous masters of past dynasties and discovering his own face. For example, in the painting "Return Our Rivers and Mountains," a large green and blue silk painting, he depicts the meaning of a victorious return and celebrating the return to the capital. The attitude of the people cheering and wanting to fly is vividly displayed on the paper! Especially the clothing of men and women and the holding of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag show the spirit of the times, which can be believed to be true. As for the unique techniques of dots, lines, drawing, and rubbing in Chinese painting, they are also fully expressed. Such a famous painting is a standard creation! It is also the face of He Tianjian himself! There are also many landscape paintings depicting the real scenes of famous scenic spots in the north and south, lightly or heavily painted, with a myriad of images, without any monotonous feeling.

### Retreat from the Beach

### Thoughts on White Clouds

— Wang Wenbiao

Many people think that there are more ingenious clouds in autumn, and that watching the clouds on the Double Seventh Festival is the highlight of the year; in fact, nature does not create anything "ingenious," and the vast sky will not divide beauty or ugliness by season. But it is true that the autumn sky seems to be a deeper blue when it is clear, which makes the white clouds more beautiful.

I think clouds themselves are an attractive thing, and the feelings they evoke are transcendent, ethereal, and carefree. To put it more clearly, the only thing in the world that can be called noble and pure is this. Therefore, clouds are forever used by people as a symbol of purification, freedom, and everything that is lofty and beyond the secular.

Reading the poems of the ancients about clouds, such as "Just go and don't ask again, white clouds are endless," such as "Sometimes I look at the lonely clouds high," and such as "The cloud follows the shore without intention," I feel a deep sense of transcendence, which is quite thought-provoking. Of course, there is some inevitable sigh in it, but I also feel that only sensitive poets can love white clouds and regard them as a heartfelt meditation and a refuge from worries. For example, in the former's poetic meaning, it is clear that it is imagined as a transcendent "artistic conception." Perhaps this feeling is a bit "ridiculous," and it is thought that the poet is really "foolish," but we have an unavoidable sense of empathy, which naturally emerges when we are disheartened and feel that "the affairs of the world are impossible to do."

Therefore, I have a feeling that the ideas of Laozi and Zhuangzi are also quite related to the artistic conception of clouds. For example, Cui Hao's poem "The Yellow Crane Tower" can be summed up by the sentence "White clouds are empty and leisurely for thousands of years," which shows the meaning of unchanging through kalpas, which is the same as Li Bai's "Only the West River Moon remains today, once it shone on the people in the palace of the King of Wu," and the same shows the regret of life that "old age is approaching." (Li Shangyin's "The sunset is infinitely good, but it is near dusk" can explain the above meaning) The three words "empty and leisurely" can be compared to the "mysterious female," "great purity," and "emptiness" realms in Laozi and Zhuangzi, which are the eternal "thoughts" in people's hearts. Therefore, the sentence "the gate of all wonders" in Laozi can be explained as having the same feeling as "leisurely."

In this way, it can be understood why all the frustrated and sensitive poets in the world love clouds. In my humble study, there is a landscape painting by Wang Dongzhuang, the last sentence of the poem inscribed on it says, "Where is a good place to build a thatched hut? Among the red forests, yellow leaves, and white clouds," which makes me feel even more deeply. In addition, there are those who compare their feelings according to different circumstances, such as Li Bai's sentence "Floating clouds, the intention of a traveler," which writes out the feelings when making guests in other places; and Cen Shen's "Melancholy clouds, miserable wind, ten thousand miles of condensation," carefully savoring the scenery, it is already making people feel all kinds of emotions, sadness cannot be stopped - or it is the scene of "the end of a hero's road."

I once said that you don't have to watch the clouds in autumn, but I deeply feel that only in the autumn wilderness with a bit of coolness can you enjoy those floating white clouds. Yes, the blue sky, dotted with soft, cotton-like white clouds floating in the wind, watching it will give people what kind of reverie!

### In Memory of General Stilwell

— Xinu

General Stilwell, a great infantry fighter, is dead. Now he has laid down that clumsy 79 rifle and is enjoying a quiet vacation without regrets, the small, beautiful medal sparkling in the Pacific.

In 1942, we lost the battle, dragging muddy, bulletless rifles through the rainy season on earth.

In that vicious "Black Spot," there were no tears, no sighs. You—a troubled old man—led this group of weary brothers with your nose, eyes, and tightly pursed lips.

In India, your face was dark, your figure thin, forgetting that you were a sixty-year-old man (and long-lost beloved wife and daughters), to practice your great ideals, competing with children all day in the scorching Bihar plains. Finally—a brave team stood up, wielding 100,000 bayonets on the training ground in Ramgarh. We could see your joy, your trembling exhortation: "Counterattack Burma, occupy Hukawng!" Your bayonet pointed east, crossing the 8,000-foot Patkai Mountains. Like an iron torrent, your subordinates surged into the desolate valleys, infiltrating Walawbum, Shaduzup, and Shinbwiyang, dawning the light of total victory. Remembering in that fierce battle when we attacked a village, the artillery fire blurred the secluded mountains and forests, bullets whizzing across the sky, you—our commander—sat upright on the firing line, leaning a rifle against your shoulder, not speaking, not eating, just smoking, smoking, and smoking, which worried Commander Sun Liren so much that he intensified the occupation and brought you back to the rear. Now—the war is over, you've worked hard, old man, rest in peace without regrets. Your young Chinese comrades have grown more brave and strong, using the marksmanship you taught to pierce the masks of all conspirators and establish a peaceful and democratic country on the Pacific Ocean near you.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 68

— Ye Jingfeng

My brother Hu and I lingered in this family for more than an hour, listening to a tragic story:

Sister Cui's maiden name is Cui He. Her father was a well-known wealthy merchant in Tong County. Since the traitor Yin Rugeng worshiped the Japanese invaders, acting tyrannically in the city, inside and outside the city, and in the neighboring villages, it suddenly became a dark hell, and the misery was exactly the same as Shenyang after the fall; the rich became poor, and the young people who were not conscripted became victims of gambling and drugs; otherwise, they disappeared for no reason. As for women, as long as they were women, few were not ravaged, or even transported to Dalian, Yingkou, Taipei and other places to be comfort women. Sister Cui's father originally wanted to take advantage of the leisure time to escape to Beiping, but he was one step too slow, and was caught by the minions of Yin the traitor, who forcibly added a crime, and not only confiscated the property, but also died in the black prison.

Sister Cui was only fifteen years old at that time, a pure and noble female student, but she was arrested together with her mother by a group of petty traitors and offered to a Japanese officer named Matsuoka Tameda Taro. More than a year later, that thing was transferred away, and he transferred the mother and daughter to an agent under his command; it was said to be Chinese, but it was actually a Korean. Until now, the mother and daughter were placed in the Tao, and he would come for a night when he was in a good mood; when he was not happy, his mansion had more than a dozen places, where he could squander at will.

Why didn't Cui He and her mother leave? According to Sister Cui, they had tried once or twice, but unfortunately the women were timid and weak, and their relatives had suffered the same fate, and they had nowhere to turn. They had many minions, and they were caught back after walking a few steps. After being caught back, they would be whipped and branded with a few hot irons. On their mother and daughter's legs and backs, they were branded with the words "Takada" and some "well" shaped checkered patterns. It is said that her cousin, who was hot-tempered, was forcibly injected with morphine to get her addicted; now she has become a dried-up person and is messing around in the barracks.

Sister Cui and her mother advised us not to go to the city, because once we went there, it would be difficult to come out in the original shape. They said that there was an even more terrifying devil's lair in the northeast of Shuangqiao and the northwest of Tong County, which was located at the intersection. Whether it was in Beiping or Tianjin, or in nearby towns and villages, all the kidnapped women were first sent there to be imprisoned until they became a prostitute, or a dried-up person, or a demon; otherwise, it would be a pile of ashes, if they had a strong temper. The kidnapped rich people, or the captured "resistance" members, were also sent there. If you wanted to escape with your life, unless you complied with the conditions, even if you had wings, I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to fly out.

According to the mother and daughter, although they had never been to that place, they knew that there was an airfield, a military camp, and a stockade, with soldiers stationed on all sides for several miles, and the defense was tightly guarded. Apart from the Japanese invaders, Koreans, Taiwanese, and Yin's henchmen, only one kind of person could enter—ordained monks—that was because the Japanese invaders and traitors had done too much evil, fearing divine retribution, so they often asked some monks to chant scriptures and recite Buddhist scriptures to repent for them.

When can we go to this devil's lair to explore, okay, little aunt? " Brother Hu asked me this when we left Sister Cui's house and walked on the road.

I also wanted to try, but I couldn't think of a safe way. There was also a difficult problem, that is, whether to go openly or secretly. According to the rules, we should report to the captain, and we can go if he allows it, otherwise we can't go. I told this to Brother Hu.

Brother Hu seemed quite reserved, and he was only twelve or thirteen years old, but you see that his forehead protrudes so much, and his back of the head is so big, no matter what, he is a cunning and mischievous character. When he heard me raise these two points, he had a lot of ideas; regarding the method of going, he said that he could ask Sister Cui and her mother to point out a hot temple, and we would pretend to be the monks staying in that temple. Regarding the captain's side, we can't report for the time being. He predicted that if we reported it, we would definitely not be able to go, and he would never let us take such a big risk. We can only go blindly. After we come back, we will say that we chased the thieves and went in, or that we were forced to go by the Japanese devils, and found a way to escape.

Although I agreed with this method at the time, I did not agree to go. I only told Brother Hu to let me think about it again. We walked all the way towards Tong County. Although we met a few cars carrying Japanese devils, traitors, and gangsters, we didn't let them see us. We had already left appropriately, so there was nothing along the way. We came here to report more than ten o'clock in the morning.

### Gazing at the Hut

— Shao Fu

Turning hostility into friendship, these days they are talking about national affairs, these news are really the most important and happy thing for us ordinary people!

When the government's political consultative conference representatives, the Communist Party representatives, and the third-party people traveled back and forth for consultations these days, the location of their meeting was quite optimistic for us. For example, Wu Tiecheng's mansion is called "Wang Lu", which means there is hope; Zhang Junmai's residence is called "Fan Yuan", which means that the talks have a scope and there are norms to follow; Zhou Enlai's residence is on Sinan Road, which shows that although he is in Shanghai, his heart is thinking of Nanjing. Using place names to verify the current reality cannot be said to be a coincidence.

Victory has been a year, and we are still making emotional, stopping talks, and talking and stopping. It has been delayed for a year, letting people ridicule us and hurting ourselves in the end, but our own founding affairs have been delayed, which is extremely painful! Now, the laughter from Wang Lu, Fan Yuan, and Sinan Road will be the beginning of our ordinary people's collective laughter. May the above three places become immortal place names in our founding history.

### Who is the Judge

— Translated by Chunliang

In the Chicago courthouse, there is a judge, a prosecutor, and a clerk. Their names are Robinson, Smith, and Jones; the list is out of order. There are three lawyers in court also named Robinson, Smith, and Jones.

We want to know what the judge's name is? Below are some of the messages we have found out. Can you find the answer from those messages?

(1) The clerk is the same name as the lawyer who lives in Chicago.

(2) The clerk earns three times as much income as his neighbor, one of the three lawyers.

(3) Smith (not a lawyer) once defeated the prosecutor in a croquet match.

(4) Mr. Robinson, one of the lawyers, lives in Barrington.

(5) The clerk earns $15,000 per year.

(6) The clerk lives between Chicago and Barrington.

(7) The lawyer, Mr. Jones, can make six thousand US dollars a year.

What is the judge's name?

(Note: Before looking at the answer, it is best to use your own brain first to test your wisdom!)

### Answer

(A): A lawyer lives in Chicago (according to 1); a lawyer, Mr. Robinson, lives in Barrington, (according to 4); the clerk lives between Chicago and Barrington (according to 6), his neighbor is a lawyer, so that third lawyer, (either Smith or Jones) also lives between Chicago and Barrington.

(B): The clerk earns $15,000 per year (according to 5), which can also be said to be three times his lawyer neighbor's income (according to 2). Because lawyer Jones earns $6,000 per year, he cannot be that lawyer neighbor (according to 2). Therefore, he must live in Chicago or Barrington. But Mr. Robinson lives in Barrington (according to 4), so Jones must live in Chicago. (1) As a result, the remaining Mr. Smith is that neighbor.

(C): Because Mr. Jones lives in Chicago, the clerk's name must be Jones (according to 1).

(D): The prosecutor's name cannot be Smith, because Smith defeated him in a match (according to 3). Thus, the prosecutor's name must be Jones or Robinson, but, according to (C) above, he cannot be Jones, so he must be Robinson.

(E): Because, according to (C) above, the clerk's name is Jones, and according to (D) above, the prosecutor's name is Robinson, so the judge's name must be Smith.

The judge is Smith, right?

### Life

— Wang Wu

Life is like a mirror, no matter how you dress up or act, it will be reflected, making yourself laugh, but unfortunately many people have never looked in the mirror and taken care of themselves.

If you are in the dark, don't be impatient, let alone worried! Slowly, you will find the light.

Flowers are fragrant, paintings are beautiful; but if you lose your happy mood, then all the sights and feelings will be reversed.

Ending the posterity is a small matter, ending the future is a big matter.

Having no money in your pocket is the happiest time; because your money has already been distributed to many individuals.

### A Youngster Is To Be Feared

— Translated by Ge Chunliang, detailed from the October Reader's Digest

The Technique of Earning Money

As the car drove through the valley of Xiannan Ferry, we (a group of American soldiers) admired the beautiful scenery on a high hill. At first, I didn't pay any attention to a nearby stall because we had passed many such stalls. It wasn't until a twelve-year-old "little fellow" came over and lent us a pair of binoculars that we noticed. While pointing out the more interesting and beautiful scenery to us, he selected some of his fruits for us to eat. When we finished eating and asked him how much it cost, he quickly replied, "No need to pay, it's alright. These fruits are free. I like pointing out the scenery of this place to people, it's so beautiful—" As he spoke, he gazed at the bright valley.

Later, we decided to give him a silver quarter each. At the same time, I asked him, "Why are other stall owners selling their fruits, but you are giving them away for free?" He put the silver coins into his pocket, smiled slyly, and said, "Because I earn more than they do!"

"Those Who Labor with Their Minds Govern Others"

I (a housewife) wanted to level my patio to make a garden, but I was hesitant to ask my twelve-year-old son to do the work because the ground was full of rubble and stones, and the area was very large. "I'm willing to pay five US dollars to have someone level the patio," I said teasingly.

"Save the five dollars for me, Mom!" he requested, "This job can be done before tonight."

That afternoon, I heard a lot of shouting and laughter outside. About twenty boys were holding shovels, digging with all their might, and they all seemed very happy. "The garden will be finished in a few minutes," my son ran over and said to me. He looked very proud of himself, and I knew he hadn't even shoveled once. "How did you do it?" I asked.

"Oh! I just organized a competition. I divided the land into twenty small plots, and whoever digs the best and finishes the fastest will get a prize of one dollar. That way, I can earn four dollars. What do you say, Mom, where's the money?"

### Lying-Down Train

— Chi Mo

Recently, a tragic "lying-down train" accident occurred at Jiashan Station on the Jiaxing railway.

This is not a natural disaster that cannot be resisted by human power. Seasoned travelers who frequently travel between Shanghai and Hangzhou must feel that the tracks near Jiashan Station may be low and sunken due to the corrosion and disrepair of the sleepers, causing the train to lose its balance and appear uneven, leaning left and right like a boat with the wind. Therefore, derailment is reasonable. Fortunately, it slowly lay down, and the lives of the passengers were not in as precarious a state as eggs in an overturned nest.

The tracks near Xin Zhuang Station are also the same. May the authorities take precautions to prevent problems before they occur, then the passengers are fortunate. Otherwise, the tragedy of the "lying-down train" will occur one after another.

### About Speaking

— ww

The best speakers can make their words subtle and to the point, resolving disputes. Their words are often just right, leaving the other party feeling intrigued.

The next best are good at showing off, talking about one thing while meaning another, feigning indifference to catch the enemy, their words containing hidden meanings, not hitting the mark directly, making the other party unable to get angry, forcing a smile, and being helpless.

The worst are either ignorant or gossipy, exaggerating and distorting facts, making ridiculous connections. Open your mouth but don't move your hands, just laugh and don't get angry. Take it for what it's worth, whether it's gossiping or spreading rumors, the speaker has intentions, but the listener is not concerned.

Before the war, everyone felt that it was okay to "say don't speak," it didn't matter, you could say what you wanted. During the occupation, the people of Shanghai suddenly felt "don't speak." Someone kindly advised people: "Eat more and talk less!" But the enemy constitution punished him for eating more, and he died from it. After the victory, there were too many parties, making people feel like "to speak or not to speak?" Everyone talked about peace, but disasters continued to occur. Freedom of speech, despite being present, was just another saying, becoming a situation of talking to oneself.

Some people say, "When there is too much idle talk, people turn into pigs!" Others say, "Too much talk leads to mistakes," "Calamity comes from the mouth." Turning into a pig is a small matter. The arrival of disaster makes one tremble with fear. Looking at it this way, there is indeed a need to speak less.

A fool's words are often stubborn and unpleasant to hear, unlike those who know how to speak, who squint their eyes and, despite having honeyed words and a dagger in their heart, still sound eloquent and pleasing.

Friends, don't be discouraged! Words are trustworthy. As long as you speak the truth, even if a thousand fingers point at your forehead, and bones are stuck in your throat, you still have to spit it out!

### Talking About the Growth of Banknotes Amidst the Birth of Multi-Colored Currency

— Jie Qing

According to reports, multi-colored banknotes will appear in our country, because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has transported a new American four-color printing press to our country. The machine can print colorful and dazzling banknotes in four colors at once. Undoubtedly, this will be an epoch-making reform in the history of our country's currency.

Taking this opportunity, I will briefly describe the evolution of our country's currency:

The earliest ancient coins used purely as a medium of exchange were called "ancient cloth," shaped like a shovel, and therefore also called "shovel cloth." The most reliable dating of the beginning of minting is the early Zhou Dynasty.

The coins popular in the early Zhou Dynasty included cloth, springs, round laws, and knives. The round coins with square holes that we see belong to the round law.

Jiang Taigong issued round laws in the early Zhou Dynasty, with the words "real goods" engraved on them. Later generations imitated this, so the word "treasure" is engraved on the coins of all dynasties in China.

As for the paper currency of our country, it has been in use for a long time. The Jiaozi and Huizi of the Song Dynasty, the Jiaochao of the Jin Dynasty, the Sichao of the Yuan Dynasty, and the Baochao of the Ming Dynasty were all banknotes in nature.

Overseas legends believe that the first monarch in the world to use banknotes as currency was Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria. When he first ordered the people to use banknotes, they seemed to think that the end of the world had arrived. They were used to seeing gold, silver, and jewels, and looked down on paper money. Therefore, the Austrian government issued a strict law that counterfeiters would be executed. Only then could banknotes circulate among the people.

The silver coins of our country initially consisted of foreign coins, with Spanish silver dollars being the earliest. They were brought to our country from the Philippines by the Spanish in the mid-16th century.

Following Spanish silver coins, Mexican "eagle coins" began to flow into our country in 1854 and became popular everywhere.

Our country began minting its own silver coins in the thirteenth year of Guangxu (1887 AD), called Dragon Dollars, which were first trial-minted in Guangdong Province.

Copper coins do not have a long history in China. It was not until after the Sino-Japanese War that the Qing government began to mint them in large quantities. Once copper coins appeared, cash was eliminated.

The Qing Dynasty minted about one hundred and several dozen types of copper coins. After the Republic of China, the various provinces and regions minted a total of about one hundred types of copper coins.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the lack of materials, it was necessary to use a one-paper-one-plate method, resulting in a large variety of banknotes circulating in the market, with different names. The printing was not precise, the paper was poor, and after being passed around, they became waste. Today, the War of Resistance has been won, and we should find ways to simplify them. It is hoped that inferior banknotes can be recovered as much as possible and replaced with beautiful, eye-catching, and colorful new banknotes.

### Three Abdications, Three Enthronements: King George II of Greece

— Wen Zhen

There are many monarchs in history who have encountered hardships; but it is difficult to find an example like King George II of Greece. He abdicated and left the country three times, and returned to his country three times to become the head of state. Leaving the country was as common to him as a habit. In total, he spent twenty years abroad in hotels as an exile. Now he is fifty-six years old. The upcoming referendum in favor of a constitutional monarchy resulted in him returning to the country again. However, the Greek people in the south are easily moved and fickle, coupled with the instigation of the surrounding powers, its political situation is extremely unstable. Judging from the situation, George II may still be a puppet, and repeat the farce of abdicating and enthroning several times. On the one hand, we sigh for Greece, and at the same time, we can't help but mourn for our motherland, which is suffering from the same disease.

In 1917, the major powers of the Allied Powers used pressure to force George's father, Constantine, to abdicate. The throne was inherited by the latter's young son, Alexander, and the real power was entirely in the hands of Venizelos, who was trusted by the Allied Powers. As for Crown Prince George II, he was excluded by the Allied Powers because he had served for several years in a regiment of the Prussian Defense Forces as the nephew of the Kaiser. In fact, this reason does not constitute a reason for him to be pro-German. On the contrary, George II often told people that the experience of serving in the Prussian Defense Forces for several years made him quite disgusted with German soldiers.

His first enthronement was after his younger brother Alexander died suddenly and his father Constantine abdicated again. Unexpectedly, in less than two years, the Greeks again demanded democracy. This time he went to England.

A Simple Life

His second exile life was as simple as that of his ancestor, a Dane. One or two comfortable hotel rooms replaced the palace. He often went to second-hand bookstores to browse or buy his favorite history books. Sometimes we could meet him at the opening ceremony of an art gallery or theater. Occasionally, he would cross the English Channel to Paris to meet with his followers. At this time, he would spend the night at his uncle George's house.

A referendum in 1935 invited him back to his country again. This time, it was due to the efforts of the royalists that the referendum could be carried out smoothly. After ascending the throne, military power was in the hands of Metaxas. This General Metaxas, who had studied at the Prussian military academy, unexpectedly resolutely fought against the Axis powers in 1941, and thus King George's difficult life began again.

After all of mainland Greece was occupied, George and a few confidants wandered to the island of Crete south of Greece. In the last few days, under the pursuit of the Axis forces, he had to hide in the snowy mountains. Loyal villagers stealthily provided them with food and shelter, quenching their thirst with water melted from ice and snow, and hiding in frozen wooden houses at night. When he finally reached the coast and saw the British troops searching for him from afar, he waved a torch for six hours before the British troops discovered him and sent him to safety. After arriving in London, he immediately carried out his mission. Several Greek military and political units began to be established nearby, and the Greek navy also began to fight alongside the Allied navies. This time, it was not as shabby as his second exile. The headquarters was established in the Caridge Hotel. The luxurious London facilities were not much inferior to the palace in his home country; there were also many officers as his adjutants. However, the palace formalities could no longer be followed. In the restaurant, his table neighbors might be the King and Queen of Yugoslavia, or any wandering monarch, but they might also be ordinary travelers, not suspecting at all that George, wearing a tailored blue uniform, was not a naval officer on leave, but the monarch of Greece! But George was a monarch who did not adhere to customs, and none of this mattered to him.

Contribution to Anti-Axis

During this war, he had little free time. He had to go to the United States to defend his country, and also had to organize Greek soldiers and civilians to participate in the war against the Axis powers. This time, George II made indelible contributions to Greece's restoration.

This year, he had another disagreement with the ruling figures of Greece, and finally abdicated and left the country for the third time, until the recent referendum in favor of a constitutional monarchy.

What kind of evaluation should be made of George II? He is prudent, calm, has the perspective of an outsider, and has no ambition or desire to take on new responsibilities. This last point—an attitude of not competing with the world—is indeed a noble virtue, but it is also a sign of cowardice and incompetence. As a result, he can only abdicate and ascend the throne like a puppet, and cannot allow Greece itself to transcend the influence of the great powers.
