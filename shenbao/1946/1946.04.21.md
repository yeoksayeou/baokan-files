### The Situation in the Northeast Becomes Increasingly Serious; Reception Personnel from Harbin Return to Shenyang; Intense Fighting in the Gongzhuling Area

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] Forty Harbin government reception personnel, forced by circumstances, all flew back to Shenyang on the 19th.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] Xinhua News Agency reports: After the Communist army captured Changchun, it captured about 10,000 members of the Changchun Security Team and police. Five Americans in Changchun are safe, but the whereabouts of the government reception personnel were not mentioned.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Ping Dispatch: The American news office in Beiping sent a plane to Changchun today, attempting to rescue the five American reporters stranded in Changchun. However, because the Changchun airport was already in the hands of the Communist army, the plane could not land and returned to Beiping empty.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 19th] The semi-official circles in the Northeast here do not express surprise at the rapid subsidence of the battle for Changchun. It is said that Xiong Shihui ordered them to hold out for a week, waiting for reinforcements to arrive, but the weakness of the defending forces was indeed a fact.

[Central News Agency, Pan Yang Dispatch on the 20th] Yesterday (the 19th), two planes flew from Harbin to Shenyang, carrying more than 40 central and local personnel, including Ma Zhongliang of the various reception departments, Shen Songzhou, the director of the Harbin Postal Administration, and many staff members, as well as some personnel from the Harbin Municipal Government. According to them, when they left Harbin, the Communist army in the urban area of Harbin could not openly operate, and the people's hearts were still calm, but the suburbs were very tense.

[Another Dispatch] After the fall of Changchun into the hands of the Communist army was confirmed yesterday, people here felt deeply saddened. In addition to expressing respect for the security forces who fought hard for many days, they were deeply concerned about the reception personnel from the central government and all the citizens who remained in Changchun.

[United Press, Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] One hour after the government spokesperson declared that the situation in the Northeast was "very serious," the spokesperson of the Communist Party office declared that if the Northeast remained in a state of civil war, the Communist army would occupy Harbin on the 25th of this month after the Soviet army withdrew. As far as the government is concerned, the fall of Changchun will subject the National army moving north along the Shenyang-Changchun railway line to significant pressure from the Communist army. According to the government spokesperson, strong units of the Communist army have been heavily concentrated near Harbin and elsewhere, and a large number of irregular troops have infiltrated the city. There are no National troops stationed in Harbin except for the government and local officials, and the government may not intend to defend the city. When the Communist military spokesperson gave a speech, he pointed to a huge map of China and said that the area controlled by the government stretched from Liaodong Bay to north of Siping Street and Guojadian, forming a slender wedge occupying one-eighth of the entire Northeast. Both the government and the Communist Party admitted that the National army moving north had taken small roads to cross Siping Street and detoured forward.

[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] It is reported that in addition to the National army's 3,000 soldiers in Changchun city, there are more than 100 government reception officials. There were three fierce battles in the Northeast today: (1) In the Gongzhuling area, 35 miles south of Changchun, the National army is fiercely attacking, trying to break through the Communist army's defense line and recapture Changchun; (2) In the area between Fushun, a strong stronghold of the National army, and Benxihu, a strong stronghold of the Communist army; (3) Near Liaoyang, it is reported that the Communist army is counterattacking.

### Military Reorganization Work Proceeding Rapidly; Vice Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi Gives a Speech in Beijing

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Vice Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi said in a speech today that although the equipment of the Communist army is equal to that of the National army, they are only accustomed to guerrilla tactics. If there are no other complex reasons mixed in, the Northeast issue will not have any decisive impact. The nine eastern provinces are not within the scope of the truce agreement, but the representatives of the three-person group have been to the Northeast and may include them in the scope of the agreement. The government military authorities will pay attention to promoting military science after the military reorganization, such as researching weapons similar to atomic bombs, etc., but at present, the conditions for the scientificization of the army are not sufficient. The military reorganization work is currently being implemented rapidly. It is believed that within a year and a half, the army can be reduced to 90 divisions, and finally to 60 divisions. The military reorganization work focuses on improving the quality of soldiers and reducing the military budget. According to the future conscription law, all citizens of the Republic of China who are 18 years old will be included in the national reserve army, and those who are 20 years old will serve in the military for two years.

### The Lives of Major Traitors in Beiping Prison; Eating Cornbread, Reading Novels, Giving Each Other Nicknames; Hebei High Court Actively Preparing for Trials

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] The major traitors captured in Beiping and Tianjin have not yet been sent to the court, and the ones being inspected and tried by the court are only minor traitors of the third rate. Therefore, various rumors are circulating outside, saying that the major traitors are being delayed in being sent to the court because the people handling the matter are taking bribes, intending to release them on pretexts before they are sent to the court. For this reason, the Beiping Provisional Headquarters recently issued an announcement allowing secret accusations and denunciations, and executed two people. Recently, it has been repeatedly heard that the major traitors will soon be sent to the court and that about ten of the top ones, such as Wang Yintai and Wang Yitang, will be sent to Beijing for centralized trials, but this has not been confirmed by relevant parties. Qi Xieyuan and the other five people detained in Tianjin were escorted to Beiping in the past two days. Qi and other heads of the puppet army have recently been transferred to the military court for interrogation. The Hebei High Court is actively preparing for the trial of traitors. Hearing passes have been issued. It is said that the investigation procedures before these major traitors were sent to the court have almost ended and have been reported to the highest authorities, so the escort will not be far away. According to unofficial statistics, the number of traitors captured in various parts of North China is 300 in Beiping, 150 in Tianjin, 150 in Jinan, 100 in Qingdao, 100 in Taiyuan, and 200 combined in Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, and Baoding. It is said that the lives of the major traitors who have not been sent to the court are still good. They wake up at 8:00 AM, have three meals a day of cornbread, and live in groups of five or six people in a room. Special major traitors even have a room to themselves. Their families can deliver food every day, and they can buy cigarettes in prison. In addition to chatting, they read lewd novels to relieve their worries or write their defenses. They also give each other nicknames, such as Wang Satay being called a madman, Wang Shijing being called "ten incomplete," Cheng Xixian being called "general of all sides," Leng Jiaji being called a "treacherous merchant," Zou Quansun being called "little unlucky," Song Jie being called "big head," and Yu Jinhe being called "Buddha's foot."

Qin heard the verdict calmly and was immediately returned to custody.

### It is Rumored that a Decisive Change is Coming to the Overall Domestic Situation; Marshall Begins Work; Consults Again with Aides and U.S. Officials Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] The Communist army has clearly gained an advantage in the Battle of Changchun, and the focus of attention of the people of the country has shifted from the Northeast to Chongqing due to Special Envoy Marshall's audience with Chairman Chiang. The Chinese people unanimously hope that the long-standing Northeast problem can be revived due to Marshall's return to China. According to a reporter from an authoritative government observer who returned to the capital from Chongqing today, the biggest problem between the Nationalists and Communists is the Northeast issue. If this issue can be agreed upon, then the thorough implementation of the ceasefire orders in various places, the election of National Assembly representatives, the participation in the reorganization of the National Government, and other major issues that need to be implemented urgently can all be easily resolved. Although the Northeast issue has formed a painful scene in the Northeast, Marshall's return to Chongqing still offers a glimmer of hope for a political solution. According to reliable sources, the new instructions that Marshall brought back this time seem to strengthen the pressure on the Communist Party. The most obvious point is that after Marshall returned to the country, the U.S. State Department called for the negotiation of a huge loan to China. It was originally intended to be given to the central government after it was reorganized according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but now it has been decided to give it to our National Government immediately. The day after Marshall arrived in Chongqing, he visited President Song Ziwen, which seemed to be related to this matter. From this, we can see the whole picture: Marshall's views on his second visit to China are clearly slightly different from his previous visit. Overly sensitive observers have even begun to recall Ambassador Hurley. According to the authoritative source, this new U.S. policy toward China seems to be predicted daily among Communist Party leaders. It is said that Wang Ruofei, Ye Ting, and their party, who died in the plane crash on their way back to Yan'an, were returning to Mao Zedong to discuss countermeasures based on their observations in Chongqing. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a major decision in Chongqing regarding the overall domestic situation in the coming days.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] It is reported that General Marshall returned to his residence at the Yiyuan from Chairman Lin's official residence in Linyuan yesterday morning and began working. As of 10:00 PM last night, he had not met with Zhou Enlai, and the Military Three-Person Group meeting had not been held. In the afternoon, around 4:00 PM, he visited Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen to discuss trade for about an hour. At 7:00 PM, he attended the American News Circle's welcome dinner and returned to Yiyuan around 9:00 PM.

[Associated Press, Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] General Marshall today again consulted with his aides and U.S. Embassy officials in order to gather sufficient information before attempting to stop the civil war in the Northeast. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall also had lunch with British Ambassador Sir Horace James Seymour and his wife today.

### Bowles to Go to Northeast and Korea to Investigate Soviet Removal of Assets; Bernays Hosts Press Conference to Announce

[United Press International, Washington, 19th] State Department official Bernays told reporters today that UN Reparations Committee U.S. representative Bowles will go to the Far East to investigate Soviet removal of Japanese assets from the Nine Eastern Provinces and Korea. A reporter asked if Bowles would be able to enter Soviet-administered areas of Korea. Bernays replied: At least that is Bowles' mission. The last time Bowles went to the Far East, he wished to enter the Soviet-administered areas of the Nine Eastern Provinces, but was not permitted. Now that the Soviet army has withdrawn from the Northeast, Bowles should have no difficulty on this trip. Bowles' work began months ago, and this return to the Far East will seek to bring it to a conclusion. The Japanese assets removed from the Northeast and Korea have become a point of contention between Washington and Moscow. American authorities say that the Soviet Union has no right to remove industrial equipment, especially in the Nine Eastern Provinces. The Soviet government has ignored U.S. notes on the matter.

[Associated Press, New York, 19th] Authoritative sources told the Associated Press that Bowles estimates the value of industrial equipment removed by the Soviet Union from the Northeast to be between U.S. $2 billion and $4 billion.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Bernays said at a press conference today that U.S. reparations representative Bowles has returned to the Far East to complete his investigation. Bowles had been charged with making as complete a report as possible on Japanese assets in the Northeast and Korea, whether already moved or not. The Secretary of State said: This report is extraordinarily important, because China's entire economy depends on the resources of the Northeast, whether raw materials or semi-finished products. Reporters inquired about Bowles' trip to the Far East while questioning Bernays about his discussions with President Truman and Bowles regarding Japanese reparations. Bernays then recounted that Bowles was the U.S. reparations representative in Germany, and was later recommended by the President to Japan, serving in the same capacity. Bernays said that Bowles had been in the Far East for some time, but his investigation was not completed because he could not enter the Northeast. However, he has now returned there so that his work can be completed.

He reported on the spot that since the establishment of the Army Headquarters, it has taken the lead in practicing economy. At this time of national reconstruction difficulties, he hopes that all sectors of society will promote this together, and hopes that the media will widely publicize it, so as to create a trend. Mayor Ma expressed his gratitude on behalf of everyone, and hoped that all sectors of society would support Commander-in-Chief He's call for economy. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Moore also delivered a speech of thanks. The meeting continued at 2 p.m. U.S. Army Major Custer reported on the use of DDT for hygiene around the city, and Lieutenant Colonel Moore reported on natural mosquito control methods. Then, Mayor Ma read out the implementation outline for Nanjing City's Hygiene Movement Week. Subsequently, U.S. Army Colonel Kerstang made a conclusion and review, stating briefly: The birth of the hygiene conference should be credited to Xu Xilin, director of the Hygiene Department of the Army Headquarters, and Lieutenant Colonel Moore. He hoped that officials and civilians would jointly promote the hygiene movement, and that the U.S. military would also provide as much assistance as possible in terms of manpower and technology. Subsequently, U.S. Army technician Gees demonstrated the residual insecticidal efficacy of 5% DDT spraying in the venue. The meeting adjourned at 5:10 p.m.

Venereal Disease in the Military Becomes a Serious Problem

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 20th] Commander-in-Chief He revealed at today's hygiene conference that since the Japanese surrender and the Chinese army's deployment to coastal areas, venereal disease in the army has become a "serious problem." He said that during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese army fought continuously in the mountainous areas of the west, and venereal disease was not a problem, because soldiers had relatively few opportunities to contract the disease. Now the situation is different. He expressed his approval of the venereal disease prevention methods used in the Allied forces, and lamented the inappropriateness of China's traditional custom of not discussing this issue openly.

### Small-Scale Trade Already Resumed Between China and Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Under the supervision of MacArthur's headquarters, Japan has had small-scale trade with our country for about four months. Japan has exported approximately 250,000 cubic feet of timber for mining to our country, mostly for use in the mines of North China. A small number of silkworm eggs have been transported to Central China. Our country has exported 80,000 tons of salt to Japan. Japanese ships carrying timber to North China return with salt. Our representative in Japan has requested that Japan export cotton textiles and porcelain to our country in the future.

### A Reasonable Way to Solve the Housing Shortage—Residential Cooperatives

— Chen Zhongming

I. Causes and Effects of Urban Housing Shortage

"Housing shortage" has become a pandemic. Its content is becoming more complex and its scope is widening. Now, from large cities to small towns, no part of the country is immune to this wave. The only difference lies in the degree. A study of the causes of urban housing shortage reveals the following: (1) The number of existing houses has been greatly reduced due to the destruction of war; (2) Domestic political instability and local disorder have caused people to flee and concentrate in major cities; (3) Rising prices and expensive building materials make it impossible for ordinary people to build; (4) Powerful people arbitrarily occupy houses; (5) Enemy and puppet houses have not been properly allocated. The adverse phenomena and impacts that come with the housing shortage are threefold:

(1) House owners take the opportunity to exploit, sub-landlords benefit from it, raise house prices, and increase rent drastically. Taking Shanghai as an example, the cost of renting a house often requires several or even dozens of gold bars, and rent is mostly calculated in US dollars or British pounds. Such golden buildings and silver pavilions, and illegal extortion, are only frequented by a few wealthy merchants, while ordinary people feel the pain of residential oppression.

(2) Some houses, which were originally only enough for one family to live in, are now crowded with several families. The air is dirty, the noise is loud, and the movement is restricted, which hinders hygiene and affects the health of citizens significantly.

(3) Various business institutions and general public educators, due to the difficulty in finding houses, cannot find a place to live, which leads to frequent anxiety and lack of energy to work. This not only reduces the work efficiency of individuals, but also is a loss to the country and society.

II. Reasonable Solution—Organize Housing Cooperatives

Among all forms of cooperation, housing cooperation is a relatively new one. Its purpose is to build comfortable houses in a cooperative manner, using collective power, so that every member, and even non-members, can obtain a better living environment. China's economy is backward, and people's lives were originally extremely difficult. Recently, they have suffered from the catastrophe of war, and the loss of lives and materials is almost impossible to estimate. However, the most eye-catching loss in various cities is the destruction of general buildings. The government should respond to the needs of the times and urgently build large-scale civilian houses and public dormitories in major cities for civilians to live in. However, because the national treasury is too thin, especially at the beginning of national reconstruction, when everything is waiting to be rebuilt, the government may not be able to do this. However, people cannot live without a place to live for a day. In this situation, we believe that it can only be solved by uniting compatriots with the same needs and organizing housing cooperatives on a large scale. Building a house requires huge construction costs, good construction technology, and consideration of hygiene, safety, transportation and other conditions. These problems cannot be done independently by most people, and must use the power and funds of most people to achieve results. Therefore, in view of China's national conditions, housing cooperation is urgently needed. Its significant functions and advantages are:

(A) Organizing housing cooperatives can gather the power and funds of the group, and jointly build or lease the required houses, and then attach various educational, health, transportation, entertainment and other facilities to cultivate the habit of group life for members.

(B) Use the progressive struggle method of cooperation to eliminate all unreasonable phenomena such as capitalist housing monopoly and speculation.

(C) Based on the principles of equality and mutual assistance in cooperation, apply modern science and technology and construction engineering to build the most useful, beautiful, comfortable and hygienic houses.

III. Several Operating Methods of Housing Cooperatives

There are two ways to solve the housing panic: one is palliative, counting the existing houses and the number of residents, and then allocating them fairly and reasonably. The other is fundamental, actively and quickly building a large number of civilian houses and other buildings to meet the needs of various institutions and the general public. Although there are no statistics on housing in Shanghai, there is no doubt that it is insufficient for use. Therefore, if you want to solve the housing panic in Shanghai and even major cities across the country, seeking a reasonable distribution of existing houses is still ineffective. You must pay attention to the addition of houses to seek a fundamental solution. However, no matter whether it is palliative or fundamental, these two methods can be used by cooperatives as the main body of operation and implemented in a cooperative manner. Here are some proposed operating methods for reference:

(1) For enemy and puppet houses, it is proposed to request the authorities to allocate them to the cooperative in the name of the housing cooperative, so as to make a reasonable distribution, so as to avoid bad phenomena such as competition and forceful occupation.

(2) Citizens pool funds to organize a housing cooperative to build new houses. When necessary, the built houses can be used as collateral, and a part of the construction funds can be raised from financial institutions. The borrowed funds are repaid by the members in installments over a long period of time.

(3) Quickly request the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to supply new-style mobile houses, or directly purchase them in large quantities from the United States to meet the current urgent needs.

IV. Organizational Principles of Housing Cooperation

In addition to following the general principles and methods of cooperatives, the organization of housing cooperatives must pay attention to the following basic principles:

(1) The business of the cooperative is for the welfare of the members, not for profit.

(2) The houses of the housing cooperative are in principle for the use of the members themselves and their direct relatives.

(3) The sale and grant of the ownership or lease right of each house must be submitted to the board of directors for approval in accordance with the regulations, and reported to the members' meeting for record.

(4) The cooperative must implement democratic management, managed by the joining members themselves, one person one vote. It is a combination of people, not a combination of capital.

V. Conclusion

The war is over, but what is left behind is industrial stagnation and currency inflation. In cities, speculation is rampant, and in rural areas, hunger is everywhere. The national clothing, food, housing, transportation, and security are almost all problems. All of this requires the government and the people to take out strong perseverance to overcome together. Only anger and resentment are of no help to the facts. The purpose of this article is to provide some remedy for the housing shortage in Shanghai and other major cities. The author once again appeals, hoping that all sectors of society can understand cooperation, study cooperation, and use cooperation to solve the current serious "housing panic." I do not deny that there are other ways to solve the housing shortage, but in view of the situation, the cooperative method is more suitable for the current stage of China's environment. This is the most reasonable and rapid way to solve the housing problem for Chinese people. I deeply hope that domestic intellectuals and cooperative comrades will give enthusiastic support and promote it universally.

Building Sea Walls as Work Relief: The east and west banks of the Huangtiangang seawall north of the city have deteriorated severely due to years of neglect. The Jiangnan Seawall Project of the Relief Association has decided to use work relief, distributing flour to the workers. Each cubic meter of earth moved earns four to five pounds of flour. With an estimated total of over 6,000 cubic meters, over 2,000 bags of flour will be needed. Engineer Bu Xichun and Director Sha Hansheng will soon go to the Changshu office to collect and transport the flour for distribution to the disaster-stricken workers, so that work can begin soon.

Jurong

Refugee Beaten and Missing While Gathering Firewood: Over ten refugees from Suqian, fleeing the ravages of the Communist army, have taken refuge in Xiashu. Unable to make a living, they gather firewood for sustenance. On the afternoon of the 14th, Kong Xianyun and Zhang Jingfu went together to Kongqingshan to gather firewood. On their way back to Xiashu in the evening, carrying their loads, they encountered five thugs, Zhu Yibo, Ma Wu, Qingcai, and others, at Zhu Jiabian. Armed with shotguns, the thugs robbed and beat them. It is reported that Kong Xianyun was injured and has gone missing, feared dead. Zhang Jingfu, with a gunshot wound to the head, fled in panic to Xiashu and reported the incident to the police authorities for investigation.

Hefei

Good News for Refugees in the Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway: Over a dozen counties in northeastern Anhui, including Lingbi, Sixian, Tianchang, Xuyi, Lai'an, Chuxian, Jiashan, Dingyuan, Hexian, Hanshan, Quanjiao, and Chaoxian, previously suffered from enemy military destruction, drought, and insect plagues, and recently have been harassed by Communist forces. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. With rice and flour prices soaring and no money to buy food, they are on the verge of starvation. Ye Yuanlong, Director of the Anhui Relief Branch, reported the situation and telegraphed the head office, requesting a large sum of money to set up stations to provide urgent relief. The reply stated that refugees could be repatriated to their hometowns, and those without homes should be employed on work relief projects. The necessary funds should be drawn from the approved operating expenses, with no additional allocation. Director Ye, realizing that the available funds were limited and insufficient, telegraphed the head office again, requesting a large amount of supplies to establish charity food distribution stations in Bengbu, Guzhen, Linhuaiguan, Chuxian, Suxian, and other places to benefit the afflicted people.

Songjiang

Reporting Hidden Guns Leads to Arrest: A man named Wan Jie in Zhongxin Lane in the city, while serving in Yongjia, Zhejiang, became friends with Shen Yiren from Xujiahui, Shanghai. After Wan returned to Songjiang, they lost contact. For some unknown reason, a person identifying themselves as Zhou Weiru reported to the Songjiang County government, claiming that Wan had two handguns hidden. An investigation revealed that this was not true. After comparing the handwriting of the original letter, it was found to be from Shen Yiren. Wan then accused Shen of being the main offender in a robbery case in Hongkou, Shanghai, sending a letter to the Hongkou Police Station as revenge. When Shen was arrested, the interrogation revealed no serious suspicions. The original letter was shown to him, revealing that it was Wan Jie who had written it. Shen then accused Wan of illegally possessing firearms. The police station sent officers to Songjiang and arrested Wan and brought him to Shanghai. They also searched Wan's home but found no firearms. The reason for the feud and the false accusation remains a mystery to outsiders.

Hangzhou

Ministry of Education Allocates Funds to Restore Vocational Schools: Vocational education in Zhejiang Province has suffered damage from enemy occupation, making recovery difficult. The Ministry of Education recently allocated 48 million yuan to support the province's restoration and enhancement of vocational schools. While this amount is limited, it is a helpful contribution. The Education Department, after receiving the order, is currently making careful plans.

### United States Decides to Adopt Effective Measures to Solve the World Food Crisis - Truman Urges People to Economize on Food - Hoover to Inspect China and India Before Returning to the U.S.

President Truman (left) and Hoover (right) discuss the urgent food relief problem at the White House.

[United Press International, Washington, 19th] President Truman, in his Easter broadcast to the nation, urged the American people to share their food with the hungry people of the world, as a sound world order cannot be built on human suffering. Former President Hoover, Agriculture Secretary Anderson, and UNRRA Director LaGuardia also broadcast on the same day. President Truman also stated that countless people in Europe and Asia are dying of starvation, a fact beyond doubt. The government has taken vigorous measures to export millions of tons of wheat each month, but the American people must sacrifice themselves to save others. If we do not economize on food, millions will starve to death. Therefore, I once again urge all Americans to save bread and conserve fats, which are our most important weapons in the fight against famine abroad. Every American today should pledge to share their surplus food. "The time for talking is over, the time for action has come."

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] U.S. President Truman yesterday sent another telegram to Hoover, approving his continued inspection of the world food situation, but urging him to shorten his trip to India and return to the U.S. before May 10th. This was a plan agreed upon by Truman and Hoover during a telephone conversation across the Atlantic yesterday. It is now known that Hoover will inspect India, China, India, Japan, and possibly the Philippines, before returning home before the tenth of next month. It is expected that Hoover will be able to deliver his first report to the American people on May 12th.

### Hoover Broadcasts in Cairo, Proposes Six Recommendations to Advocate for 150 Million Hungry People in Europe

[Reuters, Cairo, 20th] Hoover, Chairman of President Truman's Famine Committee, broadcast to the American people from here yesterday, appealing on behalf of 150 million hungry people in Europe. Hoover proposed six recommendations as emergency measures: (1) The U.S. government should collect large quantities of food and wheat, exporting an average of 1.1 million tons per month in April, May, June, and July. Americans should also make similar sacrifices in terms of fats. (2) European countries with daily bread rations of more than 300 grams per person should reduce them to 300 grams. However, I am deeply aware that this will increase the burden on countries such as the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, and Yugoslavia. (3) The British have approximately 1 million tons of grain in storage, almost double their pre-war reserves, so it is hoped that they can allocate 500,000 tons to relieve hunger. (4) The U.S., Canada, and Argentina should reduce their exports to South American countries in the next four months, and the generous agreement of these South American countries would be of great value. (5) If the Soviet Union can increase its food supply by 300,000 tons per month in the next four months, it would be a great contribution to humanity. (6) The small countries that have been liberated are suffering the most, and their domestic production is limited, so they should be given priority for assistance. If the above recommendations are adopted, the U.S. will supply 44 percent of the total aid, Canada 20 percent, the UK and Australia approximately 10 percent each, and Argentina and the Soviet Union approximately 12 percent each. Hoover continued, stating that the current world food crisis has a definite time limit and is unprecedented in history. Europe, from the western border of the Soviet Union to the English Channel, has a population of 300 million, of whom only 40 million can maintain their food supply until the autumn harvest. One-third of the remaining population are farmers who will not have food problems. The most miserable are the 150 million city residents who must rely on large-scale supplies from abroad. Furthermore, there are over 20 million malnourished and sick children in Europe today. Children are the foundation of Europe's future and the determining factor for the continent's safety.

### Situation Especially Serious in the Next Three Months

Hungry People Struggling on the Brink of Death - UNRRA Director Issues Urgent Appeal

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] LaGuardia broadcast last night, reiterating that the U.S. should make greater efforts to relieve world famine. LaGuardia specifically stated that he was making this broadcast not as UNRRA Director, but as an ordinary American citizen. He said, in short, that if wheat is not immediately shipped to China, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, Austria, Albania, and other countries within a few days, they will have bread problems. Although the difficult time is long, the situation in the next ninety days is particularly serious. Many people are already struggling on the verge of starvation, and we should do our best to relieve them.

### U.S. Surplus Materials Provided for China's Reconstruction

[Reuters, Manila, 20th] The U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Liquidation Committee announced that it will hand over surplus property worth over 100 million yuan to UNRRA, most of which will be used for China's reconstruction. This includes materials worth 30 to 40 million yuan, which are ships or port equipment. The Liquidation Committee and UNRRA have established an agreement on the handling of surplus materials within China, with UNRRA providing China with relief and rehabilitation materials, one-third of which comes from the Liquidation Committee. To date, UNRRA has provided China with surplus property worth 30 million yuan, half of which is for civilian use.

### British Cabinet to Undergo Partial Reshuffle

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] It is rumored that Prime Minister Attlee will take advantage of the Easter holiday to partially reshuffle the cabinet. Food Minister Smith, having been criticized for the UK's food ration cuts, intends to retire. The likely successor is Alexander or Dr. Seifmansky, members of the Cabinet delegation to India.

### Anecdotes from the Second Conference of the Allied Council for Japan - Soviet Representative Speaks at Length About Principles - British Representative Adept at Flattery - Allied Journalists Lament That Japan Will Not Have Democracy

[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 20th] The second conference of the Allied Council for Japan was held at the Meiji Building the day before yesterday. The situation at the time was full of interesting anecdotes worth reporting: Whenever the U.S. representative made a proposal, China's representative Zhu (Shiming) always said: "I am satisfied." Then the Soviet representative Lavrentiev habitually added: "I want to review the style on this issue. The main purpose is, of course, to ease the recent tensions between Britain and the Soviet Union, because Churchill's speech in the U.S. has already aroused extreme dissatisfaction among their 'Russian friends'." Soviet newspapers have accused U.S. troops of deceiving the Japanese people and claiming that Japan does not have true democracy. In response to this accusation, General MacArthur's representative Whitney rebutted it on the spot, loudly reciting hundreds of thousands of words. The Soviet representative listened attentively, remaining silent. Whitney read out the names of one hundred and thirty-two secret societies one by one! And laughed loudly, saying to the Soviet representative: "If you guys want to know the addresses of these secret societies, I can tell you."

During the meeting, many Allied journalists did not have seats, but Japanese journalists were given the best seats. Some Allied journalists sighed and said: "Japan will not have democracy."

### Spain Lodges Protest with Britain and the U.S., Accusing the Soviet Union of Shipping Arms to France, Aiding Anti-Franco Groups - Security Council Has Effectively Rejected Severing Ties with Spain

[United Press International, Madrid, 19th] Spain has sent notes to the British and U.S. governments, stating: A Soviet cargo ship arrived in Marseille and unloaded 3,000 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of arms, which were distributed to various Communist Party centers in France and then transported to the Spanish border to supply Spanish exiles and French Communist Party members and other anti-Franco groups.

[United Press International, New York, 19th] Australia's compromise solution to the Spanish problem was submitted to the Security Council. It is now heard that the Polish representative is prepared to accept it, so that the Security Council can vote on a one-month investigation of the Franco government in Spain.

[U.S. Information Agency, New York, 19th] At yesterday's Security Council meeting, Poland's proposal to sever ties between the United Nations and Franco's government was not accepted. Poland's request has in fact been rejected, without the need for a further vote, as the majority of countries expressed opposition to Poland's proposal yesterday.

[United Press International, New York, 19th] Ten weeks ago, when the reporter passed through the French-Spanish border, people on the French side told him that a large number of Spanish revolutionaries were concentrating along the French border, waiting for the signal to attack. The reporter also witnessed evidence in Spain, revealing that Franco was indeed engaged in military preparations. The reporter dares to believe that if civil war breaks out in Spain one day, the level of terror will shock the world.

[United Press International, Madrid, 19th] According to Franco's party, if the government is forced to change now, the only result will be war.

### Iran Issue

Expert Committee Review Results - Soviet Demands Have Been Rejected - [U.S. Information Agency, New York, 19th] The Soviet demand to remove the Iranian issue from the Security Council agenda has in fact been rejected.

### U.S. Newspaper Praises Dr. Guo Taiqi, Hailing Him as a First-Class Chairman

[U.S. Information Agency, Washington, 19th] The Washington Post published an editorial today titled "Chinese Chairman." It stated: The term of office of China's representative Dr. Guo Taiqi as Chairman of the United Nations Security Council expired on April 17th and was succeeded by Egypt's El-Fifi. If the position of Chairman of the Security Council were elected rather than a rotating position, Dr. Guo would undoubtedly be asked to serve again. The praise of Dr. Guo by representatives from the U.S., France, the Soviet Union, and Poland is not mere courtesy. The work that Dr. Guo undertook was very complex, not only because the various issues in the Security Council are very serious and there are many disputes, but also because the lack of clear procedural rules makes the position of Chairman even more difficult. However, Dr. Guo was able to cope well with his talents. He never looked frightened and handled everything in an orderly manner. He is truly worthy of being a first-class chairman and a model for his successor.

### Byrnes Scheduled to Go to France to Attend Foreign Ministers' Meeting - London Expects the Soviet Union to Make Three Demands

He also said that the Foreign Ministers' meeting will definitely discuss the issue of Trieste and other related colonies involved in the agreement.

[United Press International, London, 2nd] Diplomatic sources here today predict that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will make three demands at the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting as the price for Soviet consent to a prompt signing of a peace treaty: (1) The Soviet Union alone should administer Italy's Tripoli; (2) A Soviet naval base should be established in the Dodecanese Islands; (3) Agreement to amend the Montreux Convention to effectively place the Dardanelles Strait under Soviet control.

### U.S. Television Broadcasting Network Completed

### Retired Japanese Military Personnel Plotting to Seize Power - All Military Equipment in the Country Has Been Cleared by U.S. Forces

[United Press International, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese army has been completely disbanded. There are currently no military activities sufficient to threaten the occupation forces, but according to United Nations and Japanese sources, it is heard that many retired Japanese military officers are combining with each other, intending to take advantage of the opportunity to seize power when United Nations control is relaxed. This covert activity should have been investigated and broken up by the occupation forces, and we will not have to station them.

### Housing and Job Allocation to be Completed Within One Month; Prevent Illegal Asset Transfers; Enemy Property Review Board Passes Disposal Measures; Any Sales, Leases, or Transfers After August 11, 1945, are Invalid

[Report from this newspaper] The former Shanghai Housing Management Committee has recently completed its closure, and all unfinished duties are now entirely managed by the Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Institutions (office located at the former Deutsche-Asiatische Bank building on Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road). Mayor Qian serves as the chairman, and Peng Xuepei and Huang Boqiao serve as vice-chairmen. The committee's duties are divided into four groups: General Affairs Group, Investigation Group, and Allocation Group. These are jointly managed by personnel from the municipal government, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Japanese Resident Management Committee. The Execution Group is responsible to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. In order to prevent corruption, all staff members of each group are not allowed to meet with outside guests, and only the secretariat receives visitors. All lease agreements signed after April 1 by landlords and new tenants for houses that were previously occupied by enemies or puppets but not owned by them must be approved by the committee to be valid. Yesterday, a person in charge of the committee told reporters: The committee will strive for fairness and speed in handling applications from various institutions for housing allocation. It is expected that the entire task can be completed within one month. As for the current residents, they can temporarily maintain the status quo until the new distribution is approved, and no one may force them to move in under any pretext.

(Further News) The Enemy and Puppet Property Review Board for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region yesterday passed measures to prevent the escape of illegally transferred enemy properties. The main points are: (1) Any sales, leases, or transfers of real estate of Chinese traitors after August 11, 1945, are invalid. The losses of the purchasers or lessees should be negotiated with the Chinese traitors or their families. (2) Once the property rights or lease rights of the traitors are seized, they will be taken over and managed by the Disposal Bureau and entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for leasing. Disposal will take place after the judgment is finalized. (3) For those who leased their houses and land to others before August 11, 1945, the Disposal Bureau should seize and manage the properties, entrust them to the Central Trust Bureau, and notify the original lessees to renew the leases and pay the outstanding rent. In addition, the property rights of the Mingjing Machinery Factory, the storage of manganese carbonate and calcium chloride materials by the American Warner Company, and 12 ships including the Ruisheng and Ruida ships of the Shenjiang Company were approved for return yesterday.

Municipal Authorities to Return Requisitioned Housing

Chen Shiquan, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, stated: During the Japanese occupation of this city, the enemy and puppets seized a lot of private property. After the takeover, each case was investigated according to the owners' property certificates and returned in a timely manner. As for land requisitioned with compensation by the enemy and puppets, or requisitioned with compensation and then leased back to the owners, if there is no current need, it will still be returned to the owners after settlement based on the prices at the time of the transfer and lease. For example, 700 acres of land in the Longhua area have already been transferred back to the owners following the above procedures. As for real estate currently used for special purposes, such as airfields, farms, and warehouses, appropriate prices will be assessed and requisitioned from the owners. However, as of now, there are still some warehouses and farms occupied by a few institutions that have not yet completed the requisition procedures. The bureau is currently handling them appropriately based on the owners' requests.

·Zhu Cai Shi· 28 years old, from Jiangwan, accused of having served as an informant for the enemy gendarmerie.

The "Pao Xiao" ship also came from France to the Far East and will be used by Customs to assist and facilitate the navigation of grain ships. Both ships were docked on the Jiang'an coast of Pudong at the time of the transfer.

### China National Aviation Corporation Orders New Aircraft from the United States, Speed Reaching 200 Miles Per Hour, Losses Reaching 1.1 Billion Yuan Last Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plans to actively expand its post-war aviation business. According to a company official who spoke to our reporter yesterday, CNAC plans to open routes to the Philippines and Japan, while also increasing domestic routes. However, due to financial constraints, progress has been difficult. The company has already ordered six C54 aircraft from the United States. These aircraft can fly at speeds of over 200 miles per hour and are intended for long-distance routes. They are expected to arrive in China in mid-May. However, the runway at Longhua Airport in Shanghai is covered in gravel and the surface is uneven, making landings and takeoffs for these aircraft very dangerous. Whether it will be possible to use Jiangwan Airport for landings will require extensive negotiations with the U.S. military and other parties. Currently, there is only one international route station in Calcutta. The planned route stations in Japan and surrounding areas are still up in the air due to a shortage of funds and personnel.

Repair and Inspection Require Extensive Labor

The company's existing C47 aircraft can carry approximately 2.5 tons of cargo and require 90 gallons of gasoline per hour of flight, with an additional 50 gallons of oil for each flight. The C46 aircraft can carry approximately 4.5 tons of cargo and require 120 gallons of gasoline per hour, flying at 140 miles per hour. The company has purchased eight C46 aircraft from the U.S. Air Force, which will arrive in succession.

According to the company official, "Although the price of the aircraft is not high, the lack of spare parts and personnel is the biggest difficulty. Each part must be repaired and inspected after each flight. In the United States, each aircraft requires 200 personnel for service, while in China, at least 50 personnel are needed. This complex situation is not as simple as most people imagine."

Flight Attendants Cannot Endure High Altitude

CNAC currently employs approximately 2,000 personnel, including over 50 pilots, including foreign pilots. Due to limited funds, pilot salaries are low, which has led many pilots to resign and seek other employment. The company incurred losses of 110 million yuan in March. Currently, there are approximately 50 aircraft, but only about 20 are actually flying. Flight personnel work extremely hard and require frequent rest. High-altitude flight is detrimental to health, so older flight attendants and others are unable to handle it. Long-distance flights are also beyond their physical capabilities. In short, it will take at least another year and a half to expand to a substantial scale. Regarding the unfortunate occurrence of flight accidents, the Ministry of Communications has ordered that passengers must purchase insurance before traveling. However, most passengers are unwilling to do so. Insurance companies are also reluctant to offer high-value policies. This matter is currently under negotiation. Currently, the company's Chongqing route has one flight per day, averaging three to four aircraft. The Beijing route operates three times per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Hong Kong route operates twice per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. To facilitate cargo transportation, the company has established a cargo acceptance and transportation service at a rate of 4,080 yuan per kilogram. However, due to extremely crowded passenger loads, only a maximum of 3,000 kilograms of cargo can be accepted per day, limited to the Chongqing route for now.

### 1,000 Trucks Join Highway Transportation

With the unanimous approval of all, Luo Huaikai, Hong Zhaoyao, Gao Peiliang, Shen Jinzhou, Xia Xingfang, Shi Jiu'ao, and others were elected as responsible persons for the executive department.

### Serving Qi and Serving Chu: A Dilemma! Hong Kong Merchants and Residents Feel Anguish

— Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent Lin Youlan in Hong Kong

In my last dispatch, I mentioned the issue of when Hong Kong would return to civilian administration. People in Hong Kong are eager for the return of civilian administration, or to put it more bluntly, they are eager for prosperity to return as soon as possible. People in Hong Kong don't particularly favor either civilian or military administration; they just want a prosperous market and full wallets. As for "politics," the "comprador class" has never been very interested in it.

Since the beginning of this year, the number of ocean liners sailing into Hong Kong has increased month by month. American fruits, cosmetics, canned foods, Australian grains, daily necessities, and industrial raw materials have been successively shipped to Hong Kong. Although the quantity is not very sufficient, it is still a "signal" that Hong Kong's foreign trade relations have been rebuilt.

### The First Batch of American Loans Stranded in Warehouses

At the end of last year, Hong Kong merchants generally felt quite optimistic about the future. They believed that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar had been determined, and British and American ships were arriving in Hong Kong one after another. As long as there was enough money, they could buy enough goods. With goods, there would be a market and profits, and the prosperity of the past would return in an instant.

However, the reality was not as simple as the ideal. The experiences of the past three months have honestly told them that Hong Kong is still far from its goal of prosperity due to various factors. The first thunderbolt for those who were daydreaming was that the first batch of much-anticipated American goods brought in by the President Grant after the war was "stranded" in warehouses by the authorities, who put on a stern face due to "procedural" issues—let's talk slowly.

Difficult to Fulfill Merchants' Aspirations for Loans from Britain and Australia

Merchants sighed as they watched their American goods being sealed in warehouses, while other American goods were being unloaded in Shanghai batch after batch and transported to Hong Kong, with the boundless profits silently flowing into other people's pockets.

They learned a profound lesson.

When they placed orders with London, British manufacturers could not promise when they could load the goods onto ships and transport them to Hong Kong. When they turned to Australia for purchases, the production and shipping in Australia were in short supply, making it impossible to provide large quantities. They tried to make the best of a bad situation, but it was still difficult to fulfill their long-cherished wish, and they had unspeakable bitterness in their hearts!

In the Future, Guangzhou's Market Will Not Be Dominated by Hong Kong Merchants

As a cargo import and export hub, Hong Kong's heyday was in 1937. Goods from mainland China exported through Hong Kong accounted for 34% of the total value. Foreign goods imported into mainland China through Hong Kong accounted for 46% of the total value. Now, not only is there no question of imports to China, but even Hong Kong's local consumption is struggling to cope. Because goods from Shanghai are transported directly to Guangzhou by land and water, even if the opening of Huangpu Port becomes a myth, there is no doubt that Guangzhou's market will no longer be dominated by Hong Kong merchants.

On the other hand, Hong Kong is also a production center. Before the war, there were over a thousand factories of all sizes in Hong Kong. Due to low labor costs and convenient raw materials, the textile, rubber, flashlight, and paint industries in particular dominated the South China market and even sold overseas.

Raw Materials and Capital Restrain Industrial Vitality

Now, everything is in a state of semi-paralysis. The authorities recently delivered a batch of rubber and cotton yarn to allocate to some factories, but there is not enough for everyone, and it does not help the overall situation. Moreover, the restrictions on the export of raw materials from India and Malaya have not yet been lifted, so even if merchants want to place orders on their own, there is no way. The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting assistance in reviving businesses based on the precedent in Shanghai, but there has been no response. Raw materials and capital are like two big iron clamps, tightly suffocating the vitality of Hong Kong's industry. This is another area where Hong Kong's industrial circles cannot help but envy their counterparts in Shanghai.

What is even more, the Ministry of Finance has recently formally announced that domestic goods that are transferred to Guangzhou through Hong Kong will lose the preferential treatment of domestic sales and will be treated the same as Hong Kong goods, subject to an import tax of more than 20%. It will be difficult for goods from Shanghai to be re-exported through Hong Kong. Recently, goods from Guangzhou that are transported to Hong Kong for export must also go through foreign exchange settlement procedures. Hong Kong merchants are really troubled by this situation.

Changes in the Larger Environment: Hong Kong Loses Its Dominance

After this war, the larger environment outside Hong Kong has really changed too much. Hong Kong's smaller environment is caught in the larger environment and has now lost the dominance of "self-reliance" or "uniqueness" in the past, and is instead restricted by the larger environment. We can say that, as of today, Hong Kong's fate has entered a new track. This new track lies in front of Hong Kong merchants, and they can see it clearly, but they are still a little hesitant, and their golden opportunity is also lost in hesitation.

The ironclad fact is that the driving force of the Hong Kong market is not the pound but the silver dollar, not the Bank of England far across the Atlantic Ocean, but the wealth near the nation's borders. Hong Kong's economy is only a part of China's economy, but because a different national flag has been inserted, serving Qi and serving Chu, being in a dilemma, this is where Hong Kong merchants' true anguish lies.

### Bloodstains on Sumatra: Insulting Our National Flag, Killing Our Overseas Chinese Leader, Burning Our Houses

— Correspondent Wei Fu's Dispatch from Bagan Siapiapi, Sumatra

March 12 was the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The local Kuomintang comrades association invited various overseas Chinese organizations to hold a memorial meeting. All shops and residences raised the national flag to express their commemoration. Unexpectedly, Indonesian extremist elements (National Army and Youth League) expressed dissatisfaction and threatened to use force if the flags were not lowered. Fortunately, the overseas Chinese leader and the leaders of the Chinese General Association negotiated with reason, and the temporary joint meeting of the Chinese and Indonesian governments resolved the matter satisfactorily. However, the Indonesian National Army and Youth League, who had always hated overseas Chinese and intended to cause trouble, led troops to each shop to forcibly lower the flags, even cutting off flagpoles with command knives or piercing the national flag with bayonets. It seemed that they also invited the overseas Chinese leader in the name of the county magistrate, and took the opportunity to stab him to death on the way. At the same time, they surrounded the Chinese Public School (where hundreds of students were holding a memorial meeting), and then led 50 to 60 people carrying weapons, under the command of the director of the public works bureau, and began to set fire to the houses of our overseas Chinese along the way, almost setting the entire overseas Chinese community's lives and property ablaze. The overseas Chinese community, realizing that the matter had reached the final moment, and being unable to endure it any longer, immediately launched an armed struggle. As a result, the extremist elements were defeated and withdrew from the city. Three of our overseas Chinese houses were destroyed, and dozens of people were killed or injured on the Indonesian side, with one death and one injury on our side. The Chinese General Association, considering the seriousness of the matter, organized a defense corps, divided into staff department, command department, supply department, communications department, fire department, medical department, etc. Among the 25,000 overseas Chinese in the city, excluding the elderly, weak, and women, the number of mobilized people reached several thousand. They strictly guarded the streets of the Chinese district and the coastline. The power plant and wharf were also guarded by the Chinese. Blacksmith shops worked day and night to make weapons (spears and broadswords) to increase their strength. Indonesian thugs from various places heard the news (the telegraph office was in Indonesian hands) and came to assist, but they were either captured or forced to retreat. Because the overseas Chinese had been repeatedly oppressed and insulted, they rushed forward bravely when they heard the alarm and never flinched, holding on for five days and nights. Fortunately, the Indonesian county magistrate and the police maintained neutrality and proposed to both sides to establish a buffer zone, guarded by the police. The Governor of Riau Province heard the news and, fearing that the situation would become uncontrollable, urgently dispatched the Deputy Governor of Pekanbaru and other officials, together with several local overseas Chinese leaders, to the city to mediate. The Chinese General Association put forward four demands: (1) Punish the mastermind and perpetrators who killed the overseas Chinese leader and started the fire. (2) Do not interfere with the Chinese raising the national flag. (3) The police should maintain law and order, and the National Army should not interfere with the actions of the Chinese. (4) Guarantee the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the future. The Indonesian authorities, realizing that they were in the wrong, and recognizing the strong public sentiment and strength of the Chinese, accepted all four demands. A peace treaty was signed at 12:00 noon on March 17, and the situation is gradually returning to normal. However, the overseas Chinese community, because Indonesians are fickle, and although the peace treaty has been signed, is still on guard against unexpected events. The expenses of this mobilization, such as food and supplies, amounted to 30,000 Straits dollars (Singapore dollars). The above translates to nearly 30 million National currency. If the loss of the suspension of all businesses in the city is included, the loss will be around 100 million National currency. However, after this disastrous defeat, the Indonesian extremist elements should be able to recognize the great power of the overseas Chinese and dare not act rashly. The spirit of armed self-defense and solidarity of the overseas Chinese in Bagan Siapiapi has won glorious praise throughout the Nanyang region. The sudden surrender of Japan caused the Allied reception work to be very slow. The Netherlands was also devastated, so the reception work in the Dutch East Indies could not be carried out quickly, causing the Indonesian people of the Dutch East Indies to hoist the red and white flag of independence. Their initial target was exclusively the Dutch, and they were quite friendly to the overseas Chinese. In principle, the overseas Chinese also did not oppose the Indonesian independence movement. However, because the majority of Indonesian youth participated in the independence movement and shouted slogans of independence all day long, they completely abandoned production work, eventually leading to a situation of eating away at their resources. Seeing the overseas Chinese's hard work and abundance of materials, excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees followed one after another. Because prices were high, it was still not enough for them to squander, and illegal acts of robbery, kidnapping, murder, and extortion emerged one after another. As a result, the lives and property of overseas Chinese everywhere had no protection, and they could only endure in silence and resign themselves to fate. After the victory, although China was hailed as one of the four great powers, overseas Chinese in various parts of the Dutch East Indies were often unable to freely raise the blue sky, white sun flag. How lamentable! However, in Bagan Siapiapi, because the number of overseas Chinese exceeded the number of Indonesians, and they were united, the Indonesian authorities treated them differently. Therefore, the actions of the overseas Chinese in Bagan Siapiapi can be said to be the freest in the entire Dutch East Indies.

After the victory, the blue sky, white sun flag flew over the city every time there was a national memorial day. Recently, the number of Indonesian National Army soldiers has increased to several hundred, and local Indonesian youth also have a Youth League organization. These are all undisciplined extremists who believe that they have strong strength and oppress the Chinese in everything. Their methods are more cruel than those of the Dutch and Japanese. The resentment that has accumulated in the hearts of the overseas Chinese is not of a single day, and this time they even dared to insult our national flag, kill our overseas Chinese leader, and burn our houses. No wonder the overseas Chinese rose up in resistance. If this incident had not been handled properly by the Indonesian police chief (who had the most harmonious relationship with the overseas Chinese), the number of deaths and injuries on both sides would have been in the thousands. It was a great stroke of good fortune in misfortune.

### Emergency Repairs to the Qiantang Seawall to Prevent Autumn Tide Disasters

— Hangzhou Correspondent, 18th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

This Qiantang Seawall, with its long history, protects the lives of tens of millions of people in Jiangnan and may also affect the prosperity of Jiangnan. Looking back at history, even in the Southern Song Dynasty, there were places where the seawall collapsed. At that time, a man named Qian Miu worked tirelessly and built a strong seawall. Today, the Qian Wang Temple next to West Lake commemorates this man who benefited the people.

From the Southern Song Dynasty to the present, although some people have initiated repairs, none have been as serious as the threat of collapse. I remember in 1929, Zhu Jia-hua, the head of the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province, planned to use scientific methods to build the seawall, and invited Austrian engineer Bailang Tao to design and implement it.

The Evil Consequences Left by the Enemy and Puppets

When the War of Resistance began, Jiangnan fell into the hands of the enemy. The enemy and puppets had no heart to care about the seawall. In these eight years, the seawall has been fraught with dangers and is in danger of collapsing. This is indeed the evil consequence left by the enemy and puppets.

The seawall stretches from Hangzhou to Haining, and then from Haining and Haiyan to Zhapu, about 200 kilometers long. It is a solid stone wall, with a brushwood embankment outside the stone wall, and a sandy beach outside the brushwood embankment, and then a shallow sandy beach outside the sandy beach. Inside the stone wall is the prosperous Jiangnan. The terrain of Jiangnan is lower than the sea level, so it all depends on the protection of the seawall. Without the seawall, the prosperous area of Jiangnan would be a vast ocean. The Jiangnan mentioned here includes the six prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taizhou, affecting the livelihoods of the people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.

According to Wang Ren Gu Da, of the North Bank Emergency Repair Committee for the Seawall: the base of the pagoda in Haining, viewed from the horizontal line, is equivalent to the top of Jinshan Pagoda in Zhenjiang. From this, we can know the low terrain of the counties protected by the seawall.

The Qiantang River has two banks: the north bank, from Hangzhou to Haining and Haiyan; and the south bank, around Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. Xiaoshan and Shaoxing are also prosperous areas, but they also depend entirely on the protection of the seawall on the south bank.

At present, there are many places where the seawall is collapsing, not just one place on the north bank, but many places, and not just the north bank, but also the south bank.

Shen Honglie, the chairman of Zhejiang Province, went to Haining to inspect the seawall as soon as he got off the train. Before Chairman Shen's inspection, Mr. Luo Shaoqiu, the speaker of the Hangzhou Municipal Council, had already gone. He went during the continuous rain. He once told reporters that the shallow sand outside the stone wall had disappeared, and the highway on the high sandy beach was about to be submerged. As he saw it, the stone wall was only about twenty or thirty miles away from the water. When the tide comes, it is easy to rush directly onto the stone wall.

The seawall is divided into forts, from Fort One to Fort Eight and above. Each fort is further divided into codes, such as "Heaven, Earth, Origin, Yellow," "Universe, Vast, Flood, Wilderness," etc., which are regularly managed by a small number of repair workers. If a certain fort and code is not secure, temporary workers can be mobilized to repair it.

Chairman Shen went to Haining and went all the way to Fort Eight, where there was a gap in the "Ying Huan Gong Kuang" codes of the embankment, which was 50 meters long, and the sea water had already flooded into the wheat fields. According to local people, a few days ago, when it rained heavily, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway was submerged, and a heavy iron bull weighing more than 1,000 kilograms was overturned.

This "Ying Huan Gong Kuang" faces the Jianshan estuary, so the tide is most violent here. There is also an 80-meter gap in the Xiaoshan seawall on the south bank, but the severity of Xiaoshan is less than that of "Ying Huan Gong Kuang".

Following the "Ying Huan Gong Kuang" upwards, you can see a row of new-style pier buildings, with twenty or thirty stone steps from the water surface. This is the achievement of Austrian engineer Bailang Tao. Local people call it the inclined embankment, which is said to be the most scientific flood defense structure. Going forward from the inclined embankment to the "Du Yao Zhong Li" codes of the embankment, the stone wall there has collapsed 200 meters, and the brushwood embankment has long rotted. If the autumn tide comes and rushes in here, it may submerge Jiaxing and Wuxing areas.

According to engineering staff: "The first step of the emergency repair project requires 400,000 units of materials and 200,000 units of wages, but the central government has only allocated 56 million yuan, and the flour provided by the Post-War Relief Administration for work relief is only supplied to 'She Yao Zhong Li'".

Take Responsibility for Emergency Repairs

According to others: Since the possibility of the seawall collapsing was first felt until now, it has been about four or five months. However, many engineers are buried in planning. Some say reinforced concrete new buildings, others say it is still brushwood embankments and stone walls. Today you draw a blueprint, tomorrow he draws a blueprint, and until now, there is still very little planned construction. Today a little repair is done here, tomorrow a little work is done there, but cruel time does not wait for us. The autumn tide is coming in a blink of an eye, and then the raging tide will unceremoniously come and submerge our prosperous banks. Therefore, Chairman Shen immediately instructed: "The emergency repair of the seawall is a whole matter, not divided into south bank and north bank, and Haining cannot be repaired without Haiyan. The engineering plan must be completed within three days, and the entire project must be completed before the autumn tide floods on July 15."

After Shen's instructions, he returned to Hangzhou. When getting back into the car, we really had unlimited emotions.

We eagerly hope that "there are not many plans" and "the work should be practical". We ask the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to pay close attention to this matter of repairing the seawall, and everyone should rise up and supervise the government to implement it quickly.

I believe that the people will not forget those who truly work for the people. Please look at the Qian Wang Temple next to West Lake! (Sent from Hangzhou on the night of April 18).

Education and Sports

### The Ministry of Education Invited the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of Beijing to a Meeting on the Restoration of Education in Beijing. Middle School Graduates Will Undergo Screening. More Classes Should Be Added for Students Returning to the Capital.

[Our Nanjing News] The Ministry of Education invited the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of Nanjing to a meeting at the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 18th to discuss the restoration of education in Beijing. The Vice Minister, Directors, Section Chiefs of the Ministry of Education, and Chen Jianru, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Yue Ke, Section Chief, and Gai Dejian, Principal of the Central University Affiliated Middle School, etc. attended. Vice Minister Hang presided over the meeting.

Reporting Matters

Chen Jianru reported: The takeover of the former puppet municipal First Middle School, Second Middle School, Vocational School, Normal School, and Jian Shi Five Schools, which were improved and adjusted by the city, and dozens of primary schools, which were changed to central national schools, as well as the takeover of social education institutions. As for private middle schools, eleven schools have been registered. Two or three private middle schools run by the puppet organization still have problems with registration. The screening of faculty and students has been completed. However, the screening of middle school graduates outside the school has been held yesterday. It is planned to assign essay questions to middle school graduates with verifiable records, and to conduct strict examinations of major subjects for students without verifiable records but with diplomas, to prevent skipping grades and abuse. The detailed methods will be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval.

Matters for Discussion

The enrollment of children of civil servants returning to the capital from the interior, and the transfer of students returning to their hometowns from national middle schools that did not relocate to the rear, is estimated to be 1,500 middle school students. There are currently a total of 66 classes in municipal middle schools in Beijing, including 3 classes in First Middle School, 16 classes in Second Middle School, 12 classes in Girls' Middle School, 5 classes in Normal School, and 10 classes in Vocational School. According to the situation of each school, the Normal School can expand by 6 classes, and the First Middle School can add 5 classes. The remaining schools are limited by school buildings and cannot add classes. The return of 1,500 people requires 30 classes, an increase of 11 classes, which cannot be accommodated. The Ministry of Education and the Bureau consulted and decided that the Bureau should consult with private middle schools to increase the number of classes to accommodate them. In addition, the Central University Affiliated Middle School had 12 classes of students before the war, and has now expanded to 43 classes. The original school buildings are insufficient, and the Social Affairs Bureau is requested to find a house. (Fool)

### Preparations for the Re-establishment of Anhui University

### Life Education Divided into Three Stages

Mr. Tao Xingzhi Gave a Speech Yesterday

[Our News] Social educator Tao Xingzhi, who recently arrived in Shanghai from the wartime capital, held a tea party for reporters at 3:00 pm yesterday at Guanshengyuan, 166 Tongfu Road in this city, and gave the following speech: The task of this trip is to promote life education. Life education is divided into three stages: (1) Clearing away illiteracy. We will not only eliminate "literacy illiteracy" but also "cultural illiteracy". (2) Promoting "work-study groups". Work is labor, study is science, and group is group life. We want to "use work to nourish life, study to understand life, and group to protect life". (3) Establishing a "social university". This university is very simple, only needing three conditions: (A) Have scholars with research experience to serve as teachers, (B) Have young people with a high school diploma or equivalent who volunteer to study as students, (C) Teachers and students must have a common goal, which is the "new way of the university," meaning this: The way of the university is to illuminate "people's" virtue, to "love" the people, and to dedicate oneself to "people's welfare." What is called people's welfare, to put it simply, is "fortune, prosperity, longevity, and joy." If the world is peaceful, there are books to read, or there is a job, that is fortune. If everyone has food to eat, that is prosperity. Whether it is a clan or a nation, if it can continue from generation to generation, that is longevity. Childbirth, marriage, and other auspicious and congratulatory events are all joy. The opposite of joy is "sorrow." We want the people to be happy and not to be sad. The social university is to achieve the welfare of "fortune, prosperity, longevity, and joy" for all people. After Mr. Tao finished his speech, reporters raised questions one after another, which were answered one by one until the meeting adjourned at about 5 o'clock.

### Donghua Loses Again 1-2, Qingbai Wins the Mayor's Cup, Tense and Exciting Game Attracts Over 30,000 Spectators, Qingbai Takes the Lead 1-0 in the First Half

The first Mayor's Cup football match, held at Yiyuan at 3:00 pm yesterday, featured a championship game between the two Chinese powerhouses, Donghua and Qingbai. The audience was even more crowded, with no less than 30,000 people, and the order was commendable. Minister Zhu Jialian, Mayor Qian, Commander-in-Chief Li, and Chairmen Lan and Wu, etc. all attended the game. As a result of the match, Donghua's offense was extremely strong in the first half, but it did not score any goals. Instead, Qingbai's Fei Chunhua scored first, losing out by 0 to 1. In the second half, although Donghua tried hard to tie the score, Qingbai's Luo Shoufu scored again, and Qingbai finally won. After the game, Commander-in-Chief Li presented the award on the spot. Qingbai's captain Xu Wenkui hugged the brilliant Mayor's Cup and went home in the applause.

Donghua Repeatedly Attacks but Fails to Score

The match started at 3:10 pm, with Zhang Le as the referee. After the start of the match, Donghua immediately took the offensive. In the second minute, Li Zhuang hooked a very good shot, but was forced into a corner kick, which ultimately failed. In the sixth minute, Long Hai received a pass from Li Yao and attacked the goal, but went offside. At this time, Donghua's forwards were very effective, attacking Qingbai in a circle, with more than a dozen scoring opportunities, but they were either saved by Qin Bigao or missed. Donghua repeatedly attacked but failed to score, and misfortune came. In the 25th minute, Gu Yisa got a ball from the backfield, and Li Ning tried to intercept it, but was picked over by Xiao Gu and entered the penalty area. Fei Chunhua then took the opportunity to attack and lightly tapped the ball into the net. Qingbai scored the first goal. Qingbai took the lead 1-0 in the first half.

Qingbai Finally Wins

After the break, the two sides returned to the field. In the eighth minute, Li Yichen had a chance to shoot, but it was caught by Banglun. Donghua survived this difficult situation and suddenly saw a boost. In the tenth minute, Long Hai and Youliang used short passes to get close to the goal about five yards away, and Youliang scored with one tap, forcing a 1-1 tie. The two sides became more fierce and formed a back-and-forth situation. Until the 30th minute, Qingbai launched a major offensive, and A-Kui lofted a high ball, and Luo Shoufu hooked it into the net. Qingbai took the lead again with 2 to 1. After that, although Donghua tried hard to counterattack, Qingbai defended firmly and ultimately failed.

### The Sichuan University That Grew Up in the War [From]

— Jingming

Mount Emei is a famous mountain under heaven, a place where spiritual beauty is concentrated. Using it for education is perfectly suited to the Chinese temperament. Although the school buildings, converted from temples, are far from being grand and luxurious, under President Cheng's active management, the number of students has increased year by year, departments have been added from time to time, and the College of Liberal Arts Research Institute and the Normal College were also established in the thirty-first year. Outsiders may be very envious of the teachers and students of Sichuan University for being able to enjoy unique advantages, and while teaching and seeking knowledge, they can feast on the scenery. But the reality is just the opposite. After all, a university is different from a former college. They need to breathe more fresh air, need convenient transportation and the adjustment of urban life. But in Emei, it takes three to five days to see Chengdu's newspapers, and it is rare to see a decent sun for a few days a year. Prices are getting higher day by day, and the quality of life of teachers and students is getting worse day by day. Malaria and other diseases are gradually spreading. Therefore, the mood of appreciating the scenery in the past has now become an object of disgust.

Under such circumstances, just as President Cheng was ordered in January of the thirty-second year to be transferred to the position of Education Director of the Central Political School, the vacancy was filled by Mr. Huang Jilu, the current president appointed by the Central Government. This was a rather heavy task. When President Huang went to take over, the students' emotions were bad, the professors were not complete, and the curriculum could not be fully opened. Decisive measures were needed. He summarized the opinions of most of the faculty, staff, and students, and determined that without moving back to Chengdu, all problems could not be solved. But moving a university is not an easy task. More than a thousand students, hundreds of faculty and staff and their families, instruments, books, and equipment - the weight is calculated in tons. The journey from Chengdu to Emei is downstream, while the journey from Emei to Chengdu is upstream. This is a difficult problem. The school buildings in the imperial city were destroyed, and the school buildings in Wangjianglou were not completed, and all of them were used by the Agricultural College. Where to settle these more than a thousand people? This is another difficult problem. Moving requires a sum of money, and repairing and building new school buildings requires another sum of money. Where does the money come from? This is also a difficult problem. However, what had to be done was finally done. The relocation began in early February and the work was completed by mid-March. After thinking about it afterwards, I simply couldn't believe that this was possible.

### Under Close Surveillance by the Authorities, Rice Prices Continue to Soar, Followed by Flour and Soybean Oil

The price of rice in this city has suddenly soared since the rice cargo began, which is beyond general expectations and has attracted much attention. The municipal government authorities have also been continuously exploring and earnestly supervising it these days. However, it only slightly declined the day before yesterday, and continued to advance yesterday. Speakers speak earnestly, but listeners do not listen. Therefore, public opinion is greatly translated, and unanimously advocates severe punishment, banning illegal transactions, and concentrating all rice grains, regardless of high or low quality, in the market for trading. The rice reserves have not decreased. It is only because a large amount of food is controlled by large non-industry households. It is reported that major bank warehouses have a large amount of rice stored. Moreover, a large amount of rice is on the way to Shanghai. The future supply of people's food should not be deficient. In the past, rice merchants often took the lead in raising prices with gold as an excuse for high prices of people's daily necessities. But now that the gold market has stabilized, the prices of people's daily necessities are frequently falling. The price of rice has risen sharply. Therefore, everyone believes that the rise in rice prices is purely caused by speculators. If the rice market's price surge is not extinguished in time, the future troubles will be difficult to predict.

Yesterday, all grains were advancing at their peaks. In the rice market, prices rose by more than a thousand yuan due to high prices in all producing areas and strong public confidence. Flour sales were lively and prices rose by seven or eight hundred yuan, forming a step-by-step increase. The oil market rebounded by two or three thousand yuan due to improved digestion. Soybeans increased by another six or seven hundred yuan. Red beans continued to rise by more than a thousand yuan due to purchases from Luzon and Hong Kong. Soybean exports to Nanyang were active but not strong, and the market situation improved slightly. Raw peanuts were balanced between arrival and sales. Soybean cakes also rose with other goods, increasing by another three hundred yuan. Bran was in high demand from households, increasing by another two hundred yuan. However, cotton cakes were sluggish in sales due to the use of diesel for fuel and machinery, and prices fell by three or four hundred yuan. According to rice market information, yesterday a total of more than 3,800 piculs of six types of white rice were received in this city. The types and piculs are as follows: 1,997 piculs of white rice, 595 piculs of thin rice, 775 piculs of early rice, 20 piculs of sheep rice, 180 piculs of community rice, and 54 piculs of white yuan.

(Central News Agency, this city) Since the local food administration authorities launched the first phase of loans to grain merchants, which was undertaken by the Bank of China, the grain merchants have gone to rice-producing areas to purchase. It is reported that Xinchang, Xiechangzhai, and other places have transported the first batch of loan purchases from nearby areas, totaling more than 1,000 dan, which can be put on the market next Monday.

### Under the Control of the Bank of China, Gold Prices Are Not Easy to Move

Yesterday's high price of raw gold was difficult to sustain. The US dollar fell after rising. The gold market was unable to support itself alone. There was heavy pressure at high prices, and buying interest was hit again. The morning opened near the 1.6 million mark. The US dollar was extremely popular, and hedging was rolled up to 670 yuan per ten taels. Gold prices were forced to rise to 1.625 million. High-level pressure was frequent, and gold prices inevitably paled. After the rise, the price fluctuated. The market price at the time of registration with the Bank of China was around 1.6 million. Not many colleagues registered, only 53. After 10:00, the market price gradually fell. The allocation price of the Bank of China has not changed. It is said that those who registered gave up their goods because they were unprofitable. Before noon, it had fallen back to around 1.57 million, and then it stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, speculation also appeared to be exhausted, and low prices reappeared in the end. However, hedging purchases were more active. The process was more vivid than the US dollar. As a result, it closed 35,000 lower than the previous day. Silver shops hung 170,000 for gold jewelry, 1,600 for silver, and silver dollars rose slightly. The secret discount ranged from 12 to 16 cents.

### Settlement Procedures Are Not Difficult, Legitimate Merchants Can Apply

According to a spokesperson for the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, the bureau handles the settlement of foreign exchange for legitimate Chinese and foreign merchants in accordance with regulations, and the procedures are extremely simple. All reasonable applications have been approved one by one. Rumors circulating outside that it is difficult to apply for foreign exchange and that the US exchange rate will increase are false rumors fabricated by speculators. Therefore, the bank hopes that general legitimate merchants who need to purchase foreign exchange can apply directly to the designated foreign exchange banks in accordance with legal procedures to avoid raising the black market.

### Rayon Falls by 10,000, Silk Transactions Are Still Good

Yesterday, the market for rayon started high and ended weak. No. 120 Dazhigu Bridge opened at 1.45 million yuan, and then fluctuated and fell, closing at 1.41 million yuan, 10,000 yuan shorter than the previous day. There were no transactions for factory silk foreign goods. The shouting prices of various stalls were similar to the previous day. Another small amount of business was done, and most of them were transactions among colleagues. Silk factories have not yet started work, and silk sales are difficult to be strong. The silk market is stable and transactions are still good. The rise and fall of American-Asian bedspreads were very slight. Dachengguan's Gezi Bi silk was shouted to a high of 3,500 yuan, and 410 yuan was transacted.

### Yarn Prices Are Firm

Yesterday's white yarn market was stable and unchanged. Although there were not many customer sales, the prices were very firm. Small yarn was still in short supply, and continued to rise by 120,000. Double Horse colleagues bought and sold, also raising the price by 20,000. The prices of fine yarn and 42-count yarn remained at the original price. Only 32-count double-strand yarn was uniquely expensive by 670,000 because weaving factories were requesting it and Fangjian had not been on sale for several periods. Yesterday, Fangjian continued to sell 17 kinds of wool and serge, 28 kinds of brocade, and 11 kinds of American and Mexican cloth. As usual, yarn will be sold next Monday.

### The Spot Cotton Market Is Slightly Cheerful

Yesterday's New York American cotton telegrams were closed due to the holiday, and there was no news. The spot cotton market in this port was stimulated by the soaring US dollar and yarn prices, and the situation was also brought about, but Fangjian Company and private yarn factories were all optimistic and did not make purchases, so there was not much development in transactions. Only there were occasional embellishments, and 6700 bales of Indian NT, Meterlin Brazilian flower Pengjiapo flower were traded, and the price was about 120,000 yuan higher than before.

### The New Longjing Market Is Stable, Tianjin Gang Has News of Purchasing Scented Tea

Since the third and fourth batches of the new Longjing tea, the supply from Wenhang has remained constant in recent days, but the quality is becoming increasingly old. Therefore, although the price has fallen before, the market atmosphere is particularly stable under the customer's relaxed attitude. As for old goods, buyers are always bearish, and because actual sales are not good, acceptance is still sluggish. However, some sellers are eager to realize cash, and there are many sales at discounted prices, so the situation is still not awakened, and the market is still trending downwards, especially the top Qimen tea in 1934, which has fallen to 160,000 yuan per lot. Compared with February, it is impossible to calculate the distance. As for scented teas such as Zhulan and Jasmine, according to news from Tianjin Gang, there may be a revival in the near future.

### The Central Bank Consults on the Demand for American Cotton

The Central Bank issued a notice to all yarn factories and cotton merchants yesterday, asking them to gather detailed reports on the cotton demand of each factory before April 26, for research and discussion, and to use 33 million US dollars of American cotton loans. Those who have not received the notice can ask for it from the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank at No. 15 Bund.

### Speculation Is Stirring Up Trouble, the US Dollar Rises and Falls Suddenly, Doing 2,430 at the Highest Time, Returning to 2,200 in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the buying interest in the US dollar continued to be strong. The exhausted dollar market could not withstand the competition. The silver exchange industry could not comply, and tried to separate the buying and selling price difference as much as possible. The buying price was getting higher and higher, rising from 2,310 yuan to about 2,430 yuan. At this time, the gold market was blocked by the Bank of China, and the hedging was rolled up to 670 yuan per ten taels, which caused some profit-takers to hedge and convert, and the supply of US dollars turned abundant. Various foreign banks also stuffed out a large amount of spot goods. The US dollar, which had been rising for many days, began to fall from the saturation point. Later, the settlement was temporarily stopped. Speculators in the hands of real goods were slightly panicked. Before noon, it fell back to the 2,200 yuan mark. At noon, it spun vertically around 2,250 yuan. In the afternoon, it was again unsustainable and returned to the 2,300 yuan mark. As a result, it closed 100 yuan lower than the previous day. After this temptation, holders of US dollars rushed to convert, and the hedging was finally pulled open to about 710 yuan per ten taels. The Hong Kong dollar once saw a high price of 425 yuan after a period of scrambling to buy it, and then returned slightly with the general trend. As a result, both new and old were even. Robbie's Hong Kong electricity still stood at the original price. Although the US exchange rate was level, the designated bank's pair was raised to 2,050 yuan to 2,060 yuan.

### Hong Kong-Chengdu Prices and Gold Prices

The remaining goods are stable.

### Economic Briefing

Washington, April 19, US News Agency: According to the US Department of Agriculture's estimate this week, the US cotton export can transport 3.25 million bales by the end of July this year. France is currently the country that imports the most US cotton.

The Hangtun (Tunxi) Highway is an important route for the export of Zhengwu green tea and Qimen black tea. It has been washed away by spring rain in many places, and the bridges along the way have been damaged even more severely. It is temporarily difficult to通车. It is also rumored that there are often bandits in relatively remote areas, and it is even more difficult to pass through. Zhengcha only relies on water transportation to Shanghai, which is extremely slow and has a great impact on the tea market.

The contract between the British merchant Dianjun Company in this city will expire on September 10 of the following year. The contract period of the French merchant Dianjun Company is the end of April 1939. Once the contract expires, it will be taken back by the government or jointly run by the government and businessmen to organize the Shanghai Tram Company. It is said that a preparatory office has been established and preparations have begun. The company's budget capital is about more than 20 million US dollars. When shares are raised in the future, British, American and French merchants may still be allowed to join the capital stock.

### Government Bonds Are Gradually Becoming Active, Chinese Stocks Are Fluctuating and Rising, Rumors of Changing to Next-Day Delivery

After a period of silence, government bonds have rekindled their flames, but because the trading venue is full of crises, large households dare not openly and blatantly start activities. The liquidity of the black market is secretly protected, and the situation has become exciting. Tongbing was initially below 5,450 yuan, and at one point approached the 5,600 yuan mark. At noon, it hovered below 5,500 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of A and B were at 2,550 yuan, Ding at 2,600 yuan, and Wu at 2,900 yuan. A slight shout was heard, and as a result, it closed slightly higher than the previous day.

It is known that more than 200 items in the export tariff, more than 100 kinds of excellent local products such as black tea and Xia cloth have been exempted from tax.

### Lead Shortage

[Reuter's News Agency, London, 19th] The United Kingdom is still implementing a lead rationing system. The total amount of rations for consumers is still 80% of the consumption at the end of 1945. There are two main reasons for the global lead shortage: (1) Lead is not a major military metal, so wartime production has not been encouraged. The production volume in major lead-producing countries such as Burma, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Germany has decreased or stagnated. In other countries, production has declined greatly due to depletion of reserves or lack of labor. (2) The United States was self-sufficient before the war, but it has now become a major patron of the global lead market. This year's US consumption will exceed one million tons, while US lead mine production is less than 40,000 tons per month. (3) Lead is a major construction material, especially in the construction and electrical industries. The global demand is huge.

### Past and Present View of Xuchang Tobacco Leaf The Promotion of British-American Tobacco Company The Process of Wu Tingsheng's Improvement

Production Area

[This newspaper] Before the war, Chinese merchant cigarette factories used American Buddha and Ni tobacco leaves imported from the Americas, and most of them purchased domestic American tobacco.

The products from Xuchang in Yu province, Fengyang in Wan province, and Qingzhou in Lu province are very famous, especially the quality of Xuchang is the best, and the output is also the largest, so the Xuchang tobacco market is naturally known as China's Buddha and Ni.

Trial Planting

The development of Xuchang tobacco leaves began in the early years of the Republic of China. The British-American Tobacco Company guided farmers to conduct trial planting in the Ying River Basin in Xuchang City West, and the results were very good. Later, the Nanyang Tobacco Company also sent people to distribute tobacco seeds here. Over the years, the number of planters has increased, and tobacco fields have expanded to Xiang, Yu, Jiao, Ye, Fangcheng, Lushan, Changge Linying and other counties. The annual export of tobacco leaves can reach about 300,000 bales or more (each bale weighs 200 kilograms). The two companies have tobacco leaf factories in Xiguan, Xuchang, using four-method machines for roasting and storage, which is quite large in scale. Unfortunately, the British-American tobacco roasting factory was destroyed by military disasters in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, which gave Chinese merchant cigarette factories an opportunity to develop. They freely purchased from the producing areas. As for tobacco farmers, because there were many purchasers, they raised the selling price and increased their income, thereby stimulating production.

Improvement But Farmers

However, the farmers all stick to the old methods and do not know how to improve, and the quality gradually decreases. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Lang Tingsheng, chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, once presented a statement to the tax authorities to organize the Xuchang American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee, and went to Xuchang to preside over the improvement matters. In addition to purchasing American tobacco seeds from the Americas and distributing them to local farmers for variety exchange, he also researched and cultivated seed selection methods in Guandi, Beiguan, Xuchang. Other aspects, such as fertilization and the improvement of Kangkang rooms, were also actively promoted. It was very dramatic, but unfortunately he was assassinated in the winter of the twenty-third year. In the winter of the following year, American advisor Niu Sen was also shot and killed by bandits, which caused the improvement matters to stagnate. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the quality of tobacco leaves has become increasingly worse. Post-war economic construction and improvement of Xuchang American tobacco leaves is also an important policy for rural revitalization.

### Random Talks on Kunqu Opera

— Luo Zhenzhi

It is very difficult to train a Kun opera flute master. Each play has a suite of tunes, and each tune has a Gongpu with rhyme. Even if two plays have the same Bu Bu Jiao, the amount of words added to the lyrics varies, and the tones, pauses, and endings are not fixed. If it is dull and rigid, and always the same, it will not be art. Therefore, a master must have dozens of opera scripts in his stomach that he can memorize before he can take the stage to play the flute. If he always flips through the score, he will feel inconvenient, and his former rhythm will easily be lost. Since the Anti-Japanese War, flute masters Chen Fengming and Shen Sanming have passed away one after another. Fengming came from a Kun opera troupe and practiced playing the Jing. He was self-admiring. When Han Shichang came south, he discussed the art of opera with him and was extremely sincere. Sanming was from Haining, originally surnamed Mi, and married into the Shen family. He was orphaned and poor in his childhood and was willing to work hard. Shen, the owner of a clothing store in Xiaoshi, saw him and felt pity for him, so he trained him to be a flute master. He was honest, upright, and competitive. During opera rehearsals, he often played twenty or thirty scenes without rest, which eventually damaged his lungs and caused him to cough up blood. He died in poverty. His underage son was helped by Mr. Shen to find a job, which can be said to be very caring. Recently, no one has risen to take his place. Only a few actors from the Xianpu troupe are rushing around teaching music. Because good craftsmen are of little value, the well is deep and the rope is short, it has become an image of dim autumn water facing the setting sun.

The dialogue in the opera, sometimes with poetry, or starting with a seven-character four-line verse, although there is no Gongpu to rely on, must first understand the rhythm, prolong the level tone, raise the rising tone high, lower the departing tone far, and interrupt the entering tone quickly. On the one hand, consider the entire text, integrate and understand it, so that you can convey the emotion in the opera. Since the Easternization of European styles, people from all directions have gathered. Ordinary records have switched to vernacular, and spoken statements use Mandarin. If you use words instead of language, only those who know music will enjoy listening to it, and outsiders will find it tasteless.

Kun actors also value opera ethics. The rank of seats in the troupe is not pursued, and the order of rehearsals is not divided by class. The actors open the stage curtain themselves. Recently, because Shanghai is close to the Beijing style, this custom has changed slightly. However, in ordinary times, opera friends gather to sing, and take turns rehearsing, they must first respectfully and sincerely invite someone to accompany them. After finishing, they bow their hands and thank them, feeling grateful for their presence, which avoids the danger of falling. If a new singer is inserted temporarily, a general old friend retreats to accompany the singing, expressing friendship and camaraderie. This is truly a modest gentleman, with the style of bowing and yielding.

Guan Sheng are divided into large and small. Seeing Niang, Qiao Ku, young and handsome, suave and rich, and Langhui, libraries, are large Guan Sheng. The narration is long, with poems interspersed. Danjue's favorite plays are Jiaqi, Sifan, Youyuan, Jingmeng, Duanqiao, and Shuidou. Mei Lanfang played Youyuan, Zhu Chuanming was the cast. Jingmeng, Jiang Miaoxiang cast, just appropriate, The flute player is called the flute king, just like the recent slang, in the future, the pianist of Mei's troupe can also be called the piano king. However, the king is a feudal saying, which can be compared with Shanghai Tang's great king, and can't help but sigh for Kunqu opera performers.

### Movie and Drama Precious News

According to well-informed sources: Recently, several prominent social figures, national entrepreneurs, and progressive individuals in the drama and film industry in Shanghai are pooling capital to establish a film company of considerable scale. The fixed capital is two hundred million yuan, with an additional several tens of millions in working capital. The company's business will include film production and the establishment of cinemas, as well as the manufacturing of film equipment. Once approved and registered by the government, it will be able to commence business.

According to a certain gentleman who recently returned from an inspection of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces: The Northwest is the birthplace of Chinese culture, but today its cultural level is quite low, especially in regards to the scientific film industry, which is even more backward. Movie theaters are not widespread, and the facilities are simple, but business is quite prosperous. Ancient costume domestic films are especially popular with audiences. This shows that people in the Northwest are very interested in movies.

Famous playwright Zhao Dan, in accordance with his agreement with the No. 2 Film Studio of China, has completed the screenplay and scenario for a film titled "Jiangnan Love," working on it late into the night. According to Zhao himself, speaking to a reporter from the drama and film society: "Jiangnan Love" is a tentative title and may be changed to a more appropriate one. It is rumored that the cast has already been internally decided, with Bai Yang, Gu Eryi, and others taking on roles, and that Zhao himself will direct, following Wu Yonggang's "A Home of Loyalty."

The "Nation-Building Drama and Arts Society," under the leadership of Zhang Min, Qu Baiyin, and others in Guangzhou, has now gone to Hong Kong to perform publicly. The first play is Cai Chusheng's "Free Port" (the play is set against the backdrop of Hong Kong before and after its occupation), and it will be performed in both Mandarin and Cantonese by two separate groups, led by Hong Dingfen.

The "Film Experiment Factory," headed by famous director Fei Mu, is working intensely. His new work is tentatively titled "At the Head of the Yangtze River" and has already internally selected Liu Qiong, Wang Renmei, Yan Fei, Sha Sha, and others to star in it, with Fei himself directing.

Character Introduction

### Qin Yi

— Liang

Qin Yi, this name is still unfamiliar to many in Shanghai, isn't it? When the August 13th Anti-Japanese War broke out, she was still very young and hurriedly followed the theater troupe to the interior. She became a sensation in Chongqing for her performance in the play "Wild Rose," although this play is not her most satisfying work. It seems that she has better acting skills in plays such as "Spring Returns to the Earth" and "The Governor on Tour." She did not get many opportunities in film because of the difficulties with equipment in the rear.

She is a native of Shanghai, born and raised, but speaks fluent Mandarin. She has a very good camera-friendly face and a healthy physique, which is very suitable for acting in films and dramas.

She has a deep understanding of film and a high appreciation for it.

She looks very gentle and speaks like she's writing poetry, but her personality is quite strong.

Recently, she returned to Shanghai from the rear, having endured many hardships traveling by land via Yong'an, to participate in the production of "A Home of Loyalty" directed by Wu Yonggang of the No. 2 Film Studio of China, where she plays a wartime young woman. She is currently working in the studio every day.

She especially likes Greer Garson in "Mrs. Miniver," so we can anticipate that Qin Yi in "A Home of Loyalty" will have amazing artistic achievements.

Movie Review

### Salome

— Ling

Salome, originally named Salome Where She Danced, is not based on the famous novel Salome by the aesthetic master Oscar Wilde. This film is just a new gimmick from Hollywood producers after making many Maria Montez Arabian Nights stories. Maria Montez was discovered by Hollywood producers for her beauty and made many colorful, alluring films of Arabian Nights stories. It is evident that Montez and the Arabian Nights stories are coming to an end. Now Yvonne De Carlo, who was advertised as being selected from 20,000 beauties, has been discovered by Hollywood producers, and they are giving her a chance to act in a bizarre story, which is the same as the Arabian Nights films that Maria Montez starred in.

"Salome" is about an Austrian dancer named Salome, who is suspected of leaking military secrets after the end of the American Civil War in 1865 and during the Austro-Prussian War. She is rescued by an American reporter and escapes, falls in love with a brave young bandit, and thus develops a series of romantic events.

There is passion, murder, war, bandits, sword fights, music, love scenes, seductive dancing, a palace, and even an awkwardly inserted old Chinese man, a Chinese boat, Chinese decorations, and Chinese music. Because of these, the usefulness of color films is even more increased.

De Carlo is indeed beautiful, no less than Montez, and her dancing is particularly moving. "Salome" is her first starring film. In the future, the types of films that Dorothy Lamour and Maria Montez can play will be added to by this Yvonne De Carlo.

Since the Anti-Japanese War, the people's livelihood has declined, and our association's finances have been extremely depleted. However, we have dared not to slacken in our difficult work. This time, the celluloid factory on Luxiangyuan Road was careless and the fire spread quite fiercely. Neighboring merchants and residents witnessed our association's efforts to put out the fire, and we were terrified to receive gifts of wine and banquets! Our association sends out firefighters when there is an alarm. Except for a portion of the employees, most are volunteer members who lead and supervise at the scene. Locals serve the local area, purely with a heart of "as if we ourselves were hungry or drowning." However, recently there have been unscrupulous people who often use the name of the Fire Brigade to swindle and deceive. Fearing that this will confuse the public, we intend to publish a notice in the newspaper. However, our association is short of funds, and we can only earnestly request the assistance of the press. We have long admired your newspaper for having a social service column that serves as a mouthpiece for the citizens. Therefore, we dare to submit the original manuscript for your consideration and ask that you publish it as soon as possible, so that not only will the citizens know about it, but the petty criminals will also hear of it and restrain themselves. We will be extremely grateful. Please forward this to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Shanghai South District Fire Brigade Alliance. April 1, 35th year of the Republic

(Notice) "It has been found that on March 10th of this year, a fire broke out at No. 3 Taiyuan Lane, Luxiangyuan Road, due to the carelessness of the Huang Lulu factory. The fire was extremely fierce. After the firefighters arrived at the scene and bravely put out the fire, it was the inherent duty of our association to serve the local area. However, we have now received letters of thanks from Mr. Xu Ziwen of Yinchang Rice Store and Mr. Wang Changgui, the Jia chief of the 254th household, who were not affected by the fire. They also offered two tables of wine and banquets to reward the firefighters, etc. Our association is a business-run organization, and all expenses are voluntarily contributed by merchants and residents on a monthly basis, for which receipts are given. Even if the donations are not enough, our committee members will find ways to raise funds. All members and staff members will never accept rewards. Therefore, we hereby issue a clear notice that when our association's personnel arrive at the scene of a fire in each district, they will be led by the director and supervised by the discipline inspectors. If there is any extortion or coercion, we hope that citizens will immediately report it on the spot. Our association will rectify discipline and will not condone it. Moreover, recently the municipality has unified the fire departments, and the firefighters from the Fire Department who come to Nanshi to put out fires are also strictly disciplined and do not accept rewards. Please take note. Furthermore, our association has never sold fire extinguishers. If anyone claiming to be a firefighter engages in the improper act of selling fire extinguishers, we hope you will sound the alarm and arrest them, and report to our association's districts for investigation. Do not be fooled into paying. This is extremely important."

The Yimiao Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department sent a letter stating: It has been reported by Officer Pan Huanzhang of the Luxiangyuan Road Police Station: At 15:07 on April 10th, citizens Ni Kaihua, Liu Ziqing, Wu Yougen, and others reported to the station that while they were walking near the junction of Jiucang Street and Minguo Road, they saw a person running wildly ahead, dropping banknotes on the ground. They called out but received no response. The two of them picked up the money, and at that time Wu Yougen saw them from the side. They brought the money to the station together to testify. After the officer questioned them in detail and found no other circumstances, he counted the banknotes in person. The total amount was 240,000 yuan in legal tender.
