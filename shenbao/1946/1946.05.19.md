### Communist Forces in Rehe Launch Offensive: Fierce Fighting on a 200-Li Defense Line

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] Communist forces launched a major offensive in Rehe on the 13th. From Beipiao in the east to Pingquan in the west, spanning 200 kilometers, reports now indicate that Beipiao was captured by the Communist forces on the 15th. Currently, Chaoyang, Lingyuan, and Pingquan along the railway line are under intense attack by the Communist forces, and the railway bridges in that area have been completely destroyed.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 18th] Starting yesterday, the Communist forces in Rehe, with a massive force of seventeen brigades, launched a full-scale general offensive against the National Army's defense line stretching from Pingquan in the west to Beipiao in the east. As of 12:00 last night, the National Army was still putting up a valiant resistance. This move by the Communist forces is a purely planned action. After the Communist representative from the Chifeng Group of the Executive Headquarters flew to Chengde, government and American personnel were detained by the Communist forces. The Chifeng Airport was also completely destroyed by the Communist forces last week, preventing liaison planes from landing. The Chaoyang Group was also unable to begin work because the Communist representative refused to take office. The joint meeting of various Rehe groups, originally scheduled to be convened in early April, was repeatedly postponed due to disagreements over the location and the Communist side's claim of food shortages. Later, after a three-party resolution, the meeting was scheduled for May 8th, but the Communist side again refused to issue invitations, citing the commander's reluctance to participate, leading to a standstill in the mediation efforts. The Communist forces then seized this opportunity to launch an offensive, attempting to eliminate the main force of the National Army's 13th Army in a short period, occupy the entire territory of Rehe, create a fait accompli, and then seek an opportunity to attack Jin County, placing the National Army entering the Northeast in a desperate situation.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] The Communist forces in Rehe are ambushing the National Army everywhere. Now, the Communist forces have mobilized heavy troops, adopting an encirclement tactic against the National Army in Rehe. Beipiao, famous for its coal production, has been garrisoned by the National Army since the Japanese surrender. The Communist forces once attacked on the 14th, massacring over a hundred miners. The National Army garrisoned there put up a desperate resistance but was ultimately overwhelmed due to the vast disparity in numbers. By noon on the 15th, the entire Beipiao was captured by the Communist forces.

### Communist Forces Attempt to Engulf North China; Foreign Military Expert Arrives in Beijing to Speak

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] According to a certain foreign military expert who recently came to Nanjing from North China, the current actions of the Communist forces along the Beining Line, the northern section of the Jinpu Line, the northern section of the Pinghan Line, near Qingdao on the Jiaoji Line, and in various parts of southern Hebei clearly aim to: (1) Coordinate with the Communist forces in the Northeast to contain the National Army's reinforcements to the Northeast; (2) Consolidate the new base area of Hebei-Chahar and expand the outer strength of Zhangjiakou; (3) Expand the occupied areas to store food and expand the army, preparing to engulf North China; (4) Use offensive operations instead of defense, flaunting its military power at home and abroad; (5) Use active strategy to cover up its rigid political strategy. At present, due to the destruction of railways and the lack of ships for sea transport, North China's provinces are isolated from the north and south, exhibiting symptoms of paralysis.

[Our Dispatch] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), in response to factually incorrect statements made by a certain UNRRA official in Hong Kong to a United Press reporter, invited the press to make clarifications at 5:00 PM yesterday, summarizing four points as follows: (1) The telegram only indicated that it was Mr. Ray, the Director of the Far East Office of UNRRA and Acting Director of the China Office, and he will thoroughly investigate who is responsible. (2) UNRRA's operations will definitely not be moved to Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is still under British rule, which is clearly an unreasonable statement. (3) About 60% of UNRRA's relief supplies to China are shipped to Shanghai and then transported to various places, about 15% are shipped to Kowloon for use in the South China region, and about 25% are shipped to North China, Qingdao, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and other places. There is no case where goods were shipped through Hong Kong. (4) All relief supplies can be sold and distributed in the open market. Shanghai has no official market at all, so it is not known what the black market refers to, and there have never been large quantities of supplies stolen from CNRRA's warehouses.

Furthermore, Mr. Ray, Director of the Far East Office of UNRRA, yesterday ______ the United Press _______ that he considered all the sections of "UNRRA" to be completely inaccurate. He said: "The UNRRA" and "CNRRA" will continue to operate under the terms of the basic agreement signed between the Chinese National Government and "UNRRA," and the headquarters of the two _______ will still be located in Shanghai.

The original United Press telegram is quoted as follows: [United Press Hong Kong Dispatch, 17th] According to a certain UNRRA official who recently returned here from Shanghai, due to "poor handling of relief supplies by CNRRA," a large part of UNRRA's operations will be moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong. He said: "Almost any item supplied by UNRRA can be openly purchased from the black market in Shanghai." He also said: "According to the agreement between CNRRA and UNRRA, all relief supplies _______ "distributed" by CNRRA. If these relief supplies _______ transported via Hong Kong, they will be _______ more widely _______ the majority of the Chinese masses.

### Drought Ends, Harvest Hopeful, Rice Prices in Guangdong and Hong Kong Have Fallen, Guangdong Authorities Plan to Transport Rice from Outside to Relief

[United Press Hong Kong Dispatch, 17th] Hong Kong has suffered from a long drought, but now there has been abundant rain, and rice prices have therefore fallen. The spring harvest in Guangdong Province is promising, and farmers have begun transplanting rice seedlings. By the end of last week, the accumulated rainfall was nearly five inches. This was the first rainfall of the month. The average rainfall for May has always been eleven inches, and it is hoped that this number can be maintained this year. The price of the best-quality Guangdong rice has fallen sharply from HK$200 per picul to HK$175, and second-quality rice has fallen to HK$160. In Guangzhou, rice prices once rose to 100,000 yuan per picul, but fell back to 70,000 yuan last week. It is said that farmers are selling part of their stored grain because they believe that the harvest will improve after the heavy rain. When rice prices reached their peak, there were incidents of rice grabbing. The Guangzhou relief authorities have ordered 10,000 bags of flour from Wuhu and 5,000 bags from Shanghai, which will be transported within half a month and sold publicly at 43,000 yuan per picul.

[United Press Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] According to an official announcement: Provincial Chairman Luo Zhuoying has arranged for the Chamber of Commerce to purchase 10,000 bags of rice from Wuhu and has obtained assistance from Vietnam. Vietnamese rice transported from Haiphong is sold in Guangzhou for only 20,000 yuan per picul. The Provincial Government, on the recommendation of the Guangzhou Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has prohibited the sale of polished rice and the milling of brown rice to white rice to avoid waste, as polished rice lacks vitamins. The CNRRA has opened 12 soup kitchens and 4 economic canteens, and the refugee camps have also been expanded by the CNRRA, accommodating 35,000 poor people, providing each person with two pounds of rice per day, and distributing 1,000 tons of rice to 100,000 poor people, with 80,000 people already benefiting, each receiving 18 catties of rice.

Establish Inspection Office to Maintain Shipping

The Second Water Police District authorities previously intended to work with the 145th Division of the garrison and the Military Police Corps to organize an inspection office to implement inspection tasks in order to prevent bandits from looting ships and maintain water traffic and to eliminate criminals. However, due to the large number of wharves operated by various shipping companies and the limited number of personnel, it was impossible to allocate manpower, so it was difficult to implement at that time. Now, the Shipping Industry Association believes that the lack of safety in shipping greatly affects business. After discussion by the association, it was decided to establish limited and fixed wharves in each key area along the shipping routes and to establish inspection offices at the wharves in Qixu and Liangmen to allow military police to send personnel to inspect.

### Provincial System and Unification

— Xu Erxin

The current system of political organization in our country can be divided into three levels: "central," "provincial," and "county" (district offices are not included for the time being). Generally, provinces and counties are jointly referred to as local governments, to distinguish them from the central government. Regarding the division of powers, those who advocate centralism, mindful of the past when provincial warlords occupied territory and opposed the central government, creating a divided situation and hindering national unification, propose reducing the size of provinces in order to weaken their power, so that central government policies can be easily implemented and achieve the effect of limbs obeying the head. Those who advocate decentralization believe that centralism prevents the full development of democratic politics, and it is necessary to implement provincial autonomy, vigorously enhancing the power of provinces in order to adapt to the trend of modern democratic politics. Opinions are divided and no consensus has been reached. How should the position of provinces be defined, and how should their powers be clearly divided from those of the central government? This is a matter of great concern to people in the country. Here, I will first provide a detailed analysis from a historical perspective of our country.

Our country's past political system valued a unified structure. Before the Qin Dynasty, during the feudal era, the Son of Heaven ruled the various feudal lords. However, the number of feudal lords was close to ten thousand, which was beyond the capacity of the Son of Heaven to rule alone. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor divided the wilderness into provinces and established four supervisors to govern the myriad states separately. Yao divided the world into nine provinces, and Shun initiated twelve provinces. The nine provinces of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties each had a governor to oversee the myriad states and separately govern the feudal lords. Since the Qin Dynasty abolished the feudal system and established prefectures and counties, the imperial court ruled the counties directly. Fearing that its reach would be insufficient, it sent supervisory censors to inspect the prefectures and counties. During the Han Dynasty, as the territory expanded daily and the number of prefectures and counties increased, Emperor Wu established thirteen departments (also called provinces) with commissioners who, according to imperial edict, asked about affairs based on six articles and inspected their respective departments. In the Later Han Dynasty, famous officials were appointed as commissioners, managing the affairs of the provinces and prefectures, and they were also given separate adjutants and subordinates, known as the Outer Bureau. The Jin Dynasty established nineteen provincial commissioners. Those with great power were granted imperial insignia; those with less power were granted temporary or delegated insignia, and they were required to report to the capital every three years. During the Sui Dynasty, due to the division and fragmentation of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the number of prefectures and counties doubled compared to the Han Dynasty. Therefore, the prefectures were abolished, and the provinces governed the people. The commissioners no longer had the responsibility of impeachment. The ancient system of provinces leading prefectures was abolished. During the Tang Dynasty, the changes to prefectures and counties were frequent. Fifteen circuits were established to govern the prefectures. Initially, patrol envoys were appointed, two for each circuit. Later, they were changed to investigation envoys, one for each circuit, then changed to collection and disposition envoys, and finally to observation envoys. In border areas with enemy incursions, they were given ceremonial insignia and were called military commissioners. The Song Dynasty changed circuits to routes, dividing the country into fifteen routes. Each route included prefectures, states, garrisons, and counties. Each route had a transportation commissioner who also served as an investigation commissioner. They were responsible for everything in the route, including border defense, bandits, criminal lawsuits, finances, and inspections. The name "province" originated from the establishment of the Branch Secretariat in the Yuan Dynasty, which governed prefectures, states, and counties. The Branch Secretariat was relative to the Central Secretariat. Although the Central Secretariat was located in the capital, it still governed the lands of Shandong, Shanxi, and Hebei, which is proof that the imperial court directly governed prefectures and counties. The Central Secretariat was the source of political power and the highest authority in the central government; the Branch Secretariat was a branch that performed its duties on its behalf, so it was also headed by a director of political affairs. The Ming Dynasty changed it to thirteen provincial administration commissions, also called thirteen provinces. Two were directly governed, with the capital area directly under the Ministry of Revenue. This is further proof that the imperial court directly governed prefectures and counties. Later, in addition to the administration commissioners, separate governors were established in each province, with varying numbers. According to the Ming system, initially there were eighteen provinces, and administration commissions were also established in the capital area, still called directly governed, just as the Han Dynasty established thirteen departments, with the Capital Region being one of them, and the Tang Dynasty established fifteen circuits, with the capital area also being one of them. Each province had a governor responsible for defending the territory, holding the title of a capital official and concurrently managing civil affairs. Several provinces were governed by a governor-general. Since the founding of the Republic of China, each province first established a circuit commissioner, later changed to governor, managing administrative affairs, and a separate military governor was established to manage military affairs. The governor was a supervisor, and the military governor was a commander, each with their own specific duties. But in reality, the governor was often constrained by the military governor, leading to warlord separatism and endless civil wars.

From the above, it can be seen that from the Han Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, in order for the imperial court to govern the prefectures and counties, it was necessary to establish an intermediate organization to serve as a hub for connecting the imperial court and the prefectures and counties. The commissioners, observation envoys, transportation commissioners, directors of political affairs, and governors who were appointed were all officials from the capital, serving as supervisors of the prefectures and counties under their jurisdiction. Within the prefectures and counties they governed, they were responsible for promoting education and culture, encouraging agriculture, managing the military, investigating and arresting criminals, equalizing taxes, redressing grievances, reviewing prison cases, correcting official conduct, providing disaster relief, alleviating the suffering of the people, and observing customs. On the other hand, they also reported the situation of the prefectures and counties under their jurisdiction to the imperial court, conveying the people's concerns. The matters they handled were extremely broad, and the powers and responsibilities they exercised were extremely important. However, everything was based on the orders of the central government and carried out under the command of the imperial court. Unless the imperial court lost its authority and the country was in great chaos, there were few cases of separatism and unwarranted ambition. This cannot but be considered an excellent system.

In the early Republic, the provincial system lost its original meaning, and the warlords began to act arbitrarily. Provinces were mistakenly regarded as local governments. Since then, there has been a strong advocacy for a democratic political system, leading to the idea of provincial local autonomy, and even the proposal that provinces should have property rights. As a result of consultations at the Political Consultative Conference, provinces were designated as the highest level of autonomous units. There were also provinces that formulated their own provincial autonomy laws, and there were disputes in the constitutional army small group meetings. It seems as if the implementation of democratic politics must be based on enhancing the status of provinces and expanding their powers. It is not known that for thousands of years, our country has been a unitary state, and "provinces" are not the units that constitute the country, meaning that the country was not formed after there were several provinces. The "provinces" of China are fundamentally different in nature from the "states" of a federal country and cannot be compared arbitrarily. In the political history of our country, the position of provinces has been between the imperial court and the prefectures and counties, subject to the command of the imperial court, exercising the administration of the state, and leading the prefectures and counties under its jurisdiction. It can only be regarded as an outer arm or a mobile platform of the central government, and cannot be regarded as a fragmented local political organization with its own independence and particularity, as mentioned above. Perhaps it is argued that in the past our country was an autocratic political system with centralized power by the imperial court, and now the provinces must implement local autonomy, with sovereignty residing in the people, and the situation is different. It is not known that the term "local autonomy" was first seen in the late Qing Dynasty's preparation for constitutionalism, using the implementation of "local autonomy" to appease the revolutionary atmosphere. The original meaning of local autonomy was to change from governance by officials to governance by the people, that is, local political affairs would be governed by the people themselves. However, people's self-governance has its necessary procedures and cannot be achieved overnight. If the people automatically organize local autonomous governments and use force to confront the central government, this is "revolution," not "local autonomy." Sun Yat-sen's teachings in the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction contained the following provisions on local autonomy: "A fully autonomous county shall have its citizens enjoy four direct civil rights." "After the establishment of each county's local autonomous government, one national representative may be elected to organize a representative assembly to participate in central political affairs." "When all the counties in a province have achieved full autonomy, it shall be the beginning of the constitutional era, and the national representative assembly may elect a governor as the supervisor of the province's autonomy. As for the state administration within the province, the governor shall be subject to the command of the central government." "The county is the unit of autonomy, and the province stands between the central government and the county, acting as a political liaison." Moreover, the local autonomy implementation law stipulates that all matters are the responsibility of the county. It can be seen that the implementation of local autonomy should indeed only take the county as the unit and the foundation. The reasons are: (1) The institution for governing the people in our country is the county, and changing governance by officials to governance by the people should start from the county. (2) The institutions of local autonomy, such as districts, townships, and towns, are directly subordinate to the county. (3) Only the citizens of an autonomous county can enjoy the exercise of the four direct civil rights. The province is both a supervisory institution for autonomy and an executive institution for state administration, with a nature largely similar to the "states," "circuits," and "routes" of past dynasties, as well as the "provinces" of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. It cannot be regarded as a purely local autonomous institution, meaning it cannot be called the "highest autonomous unit." Therefore, the so-called "local autonomy" and "provincial autonomy" are the same in name but different in reality. "Local autonomy" is the foundation for the implementation of constitutionalism and the beginning of the exercise of civil rights. Its focus is on the county, not the province. Its implementation procedure is from the bottom up to the upper limit, using it to confront the central government as a check and balance, and there is no real civil rights to speak of. Its focus is on the province, not the county. Its implementation procedure is from the top down, or even without any procedure at all, and is created by a special force, which is no less than using the name of local autonomy to carry out the reality of local separatism. What begins with "provincial autonomy" will inevitably end with the theory of "federal provincial autonomy," and "federal provincial autonomy" was originally a conspiracy by some politicians around 1920 to resist the National Revolution.

As for the powers of the province, Sun Yat-sen's teachings in the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, Article 10, clearly stipulates that "During this period, the powers of the central government and the provinces shall adopt a system of balanced powers. Matters of a national nature shall be assigned to the central government, and matters of a locally appropriate nature shall be assigned to the local governments, without favoring either centralism or decentralization." Given the vast land area of our country and the differences in customs and practices, it is difficult for the central government to ensure that its national policies are universally suitable within each administrative region. The central government can naturally grant the provinces the power to adapt to local conditions. As long as the provinces do not violate the laws and regulations of the central government, they can fully exercise their powers and can also formulate provincial individual laws. However, national defense, military affairs, diplomacy, judiciary, finance, and monetary systems should all be directly handled by the central government, without allowing division or fragmentation, and the provinces shall not interfere. Even in other areas such as civil administration, finance, education, transportation, agriculture and forestry, and society, those aspects that are of a national nature shall be the responsibility of the central government, and the provinces may still adapt to local conditions and make appropriate changes. For example, the investigation of the population of the entire province, the reorganization of land registration, the organization of autonomous baojia institutions, the organization and training of guards, the collection of taxes, the construction of roads, the construction of water conservancy projects, the popularization of education and literacy, the promotion of sanitation, the improvement and promotion of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and animal husbandry, and the establishment of relief efforts, etc., the provinces can, within the scope of not violating the central government's laws and regulations, supervise and lead the counties to implement them in order to promote the development of local undertakings. The so-called local powers should include the county level. At present, the powers of the county are subject to various restrictions, and county undertakings are extremely difficult to expand. Men of talent often leave the county for other places, much like "Han Ji wept when he was sent to govern Huaiyang, and Tang Ban Jingqian was overjoyed to be appointed to the Dali Temple." The powers of the central government and the local governments should be clearly stipulated in the constitution in a list format, to correct the malady of excessive provincial power and being top-heavy. In particular, a portion of the original powers of the province should be distributed to the county, the province's undertakings should be minimized, the county's institutions should be expanded, the county's finances should be enriched, and the county's undertakings should be promoted as much as possible, in order to comply with the principle of balanced power and to make local autonomy based on the foundation of county undertakings. Only in this way can it truly conform to the spirit of democratic politics. The province, on the one hand, occupies the position of supervisor, supervising the counties to implement local autonomy, and on the other hand, is subject to the command of the central government, faithfully executing the state's administration. In this way, they are closely linked, leading the counties to move towards the center to support the central government, so that the organization of the country is tight and strong.

The author believes that the provisions of the provincial system must be based on strengthening unification and consolidating the central government. At present, the area of ​​the provinces is indeed slightly larger, but with the advancement of transportation and the development of telecommunications, the land area has invisibly shrunk, and central control has become easier. Reducing the size of provinces and re-dividing them can indeed weaken the power of the provinces, but there are also many disputes. With the increase in units and the establishment of official offices, the central government's supervision and command may also lose its agility, which will have the drawbacks of repeating the mistakes of the Sui Dynasty's change of prefectures to states, causing the province to lose its original function of being a hub for communication. And increasing the degree of difference between the provinces in terms of wealth, population, culture, transportation, etc., will result in talents being concentrated in certain places, and it will be difficult for local education to develop universally and evenly. Therefore, the establishment of provinces, their regions may as well remain the same, but the system must be in accordance with the provisions of Sun Yat-sen's Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, so that its position is between the central government and the county as the supervisor of autonomy, subject to the command of the central government, and executing the state administration. Its powers adopt a balanced power system, and under the principle of strengthening unification and consolidating the central government, adapt to local conditions to exercise its powers. If there are those who, under the guise of local autonomy, carry out separatist movements, undermine the unity of the country, and create a situation of separatism, then the entire strength of the country will be dispersed and weakened as a result, and even those who are separatists will only be able to fight each other and seize each other, and the result will inevitably lead to destruction and defeat. Our Chinese nation has always loved peace, and the people's hearts are inclined to unification. The Chinese political system is also conducive to unification and not to division. Unification leads to order, and division leads to chaos. The lessons of the past are not far away. All those who seize land and possess soldiers may be able to maintain themselves for a time, but sooner or later, they will inevitably reap the consequences of their own destruction. Historical examples are clear and numerous. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the warlords have been divided and the situation has been difficult to destroy. However, the National Revolutionary Army, led by Chairman Chiang, divided and conquered the north, and they were unstoppable. They gradually cleared away the separatist forces, and the situation of unification has been achieved. The people have long been tired of chaos and hope for order. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and we have once again been invited to join the ranks of the four great powers, our international status has increased. [We should] work together to implement Sun Yat-sen's teachings, strive to implement local autonomy, end the period of political tutelage, implement constitutionalism, and move towards unification, so that true democratic politics can be fully developed. All parties and factions in the country should put aside their personal prejudices, work together in harmony, and unanimously support Chairman Chiang in leading the country to complete the great cause of national reconstruction, so that the country can permanently achieve prosperity, strength, and happiness. Because the opinions on the provincial system from all parties vary greatly and the disputes are quite fierce, and there are misunderstandings about the meaning of local autonomy and the procedures for its implementation. The reason why the Northeast issue has not been able to reach an agreement is that one party insists on establishing a local autonomous government. Although the National Assembly will be convened next week, the session is not far away. The formulation of the constitution and the provincial system are closely related to the fundamental foundation of national reconstruction and the key to order and chaos. [We] should be based on the provisions of the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction to establish the provincial system, maintain unity, and avoid division. Therefore, based on an objective and detached position, from the historical perspective of our country and Sun Yat-sen's teachings, regarding the relationship between the provincial system and unification, I offer my humble opinions for the education of the people of the country.

### "It's Too Late" Can't Be the Reason: The Soviet Union Rejects Cooperation in Saving the Famine; Truman Believes the Soviet Response Is Not Without Room for Consultation; Britain and the United States Say They Have Tried Their Best But Still Have Not Been Able to Relieve the Famine

[United Press International, Washington, 18th] An unnamed official claimed last night that President Truman's appeal to Soviet Marshal Stalin to cooperate with Britain and the United States to jointly relieve the world famine has been rejected, on the grounds that "it's too late." It is said that the Soviet response stated that the amount of relief food previously allocated by the Soviet Union has made it impossible for them to comply with the President's appeal now. According to unofficial sources, President Truman believes that the Soviet response is not without room for consultation and is continuing to pursue the matter, hoping that the Soviet Union will assist in solving the food problem. Britain and the United States have jointly issued a statement stating that despite their best efforts, the world famine has not been relieved. The United States government has inspected items imported into Japan to prevent various necessities from being enjoyed preferentially by the Japanese, as these necessities should be given to the United Nations and the people of the liberated areas.

[Reuters, London, 18th] It has been confirmed here that Britain has not, as President Truman did, urged the Soviet Union to assist in providing food to Europe.

### Hoover Broadcasts to the World, Appealing for 800 Million Starving People, Hoping That Countries Will Cooperate to Overcome This Crisis; Britain and the United States Agree on a General Agreement for Famine Relief

[United States Information Service, Chicago, 17th] Former US President Hoover tonight broadcast his report on his 35,000-mile journey to investigate the world food situation, emphasizing that the food crisis is still developing and that the world must work together to overcome this crisis, which concerns the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Hoover stated briefly that one-third of the world's population, over 800 million people, are threatened by famine. What we need most today is unity and cooperation to overcome this crisis. I may as well repeat what I said in Cairo three weeks ago: if every source of supply can do its utmost, relieving human life is more important than the economic needs of world reconstruction. Relieving human life is the only way to achieve order, stability, and peace. This action is a sign of the light of mercy turning to the earth, and it is a sign of the moral construction of the world. President Truman discussed with him the preparation to go to South America to guide South American countries to make more contributions to the food relief program for Europe and Asia.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 17th] The State Department announced tonight that Britain and the United States have completed an agreement on the main principles for solving the world food crisis. The Anglo-American joint agreement warns that the threat of famine will continue to exist until at least next summer, and states, "The British and American governments have agreed that more vigorous measures must be taken worldwide to ensure that the threat of world famine is completely lifted."

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] British Lord Privy Seal Morrison told reporters yesterday that Britain has agreed to allocate 200,000 tons of wheat by the end of September to relieve the world famine. When asked by reporters whether this would lead to the implementation of bread rationing, Morrison replied that it was difficult to say, but the British government would do its best to encourage people to conserve food consumption. Morrison also revealed that he had agreed with the US authorities on a general agreement for famine relief, as well as the rationing standards in the British and American occupied zones of Germany. Although the details have not yet been agreed upon, he hopes that the crisis in the British military zone can be avoided. [He] requested [for] supplies to India, but the seven-system system will not be interrupted before the end of June. Morrison finally said that he had reached a temporary agreement on the amount of wheat given to Japan, in principle, the grain imported into Japan is limited to what is sufficient to prevent turmoil.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 17th] British Lord Privy Seal Morrison has completed his visit to the United States and will depart this afternoon for Ottawa, Canada.

[Reuters, London, 18th] The World Food and Agriculture Organization will meet in Washington next week. The British delegation, led by Ms. Somerset, Secretary of the Ministry of Food, is scheduled to depart on May 22nd.

### The Gift of War! More Women Than Men in Japan; Most Are Widows; Out of a Total Population of Over 70 Million, Women Account for Nearly 40 Million

[This Newspaper's Tokyo Correspondent, 18th] According to the latest census, the total population of Japan is 73,110,995, of which 34,903,265 are men and 38,207,730 are women. Currently, there are approximately 3.3 million more women than men, most of whom are widows. This is a gift given by the Japanese warlords.

### Pacific Base Issue: Britain and the United States May Reach an Agreement; Leahy Tells Reporters That He Is Willing to Discuss the Matter With Britain

[Central News Agency, London, 17th, United Press International] General Leahy said at a press conference that he firmly believes that a common use of Pacific bases by Britain and the United States can be easily achieved, but denied that this trip was related to that issue. He is willing to discuss with British Chiefs of Staff officials the use of three islands in the Pacific, Canton, Christmas, and Funafuti, but the date has not been set.

### Soviet Troops Have Not Withdrawn From Azerbaijan Province; Iran Will File Another Complaint; Sadana Says That Iran and the Soviet Union Have Reached Further Understanding

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 18th Broadcast: The Iranian Ambassador to the United States today confirmed that Soviet troops have not withdrawn from Azerbaijan. At the same time, the Iranian Prime Minister said in a radio broadcast speech that the greatest task since his tenure was to eliminate misunderstandings between Iran and the Soviet Union and solve the Azerbaijan issue, which is also his own efforts in this regard. Although no agreement has been reached so far, there is further understanding between each other. The Iranian Prime Minister said that someone is trying to force him to resign and is engaged in diplomatic activities to threaten Iran's survival, and they will be punished.

[United Press International, Washington, 18th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States Alai announced today that, to his knowledge, Soviet troops are still stationed in Azerbaijan Province. He also said that if Soviet troops have not withdrawn by the time the Security Council meets next Monday, this issue will be raised again.

### President Truman Orders Federal Takeover of U.S. Railroads, Issues Appeal to Rail Workers for Continued Service and Cooperation; Nationwide Economic Stagnation Imminent if Workers Strike

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th dispatch] American railway workers have decided to implement a general strike, the deadline for which has arrived today. If no solution is reached, the national economy is poised to be paralyzed. Union leaders insist that the strike should be carried out as scheduled.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th dispatch] President Truman ordered the federal takeover of all U.S. railroads tonight in order to prevent a rail worker strike scheduled for 9 p.m. tomorrow (6 a.m. Shanghai Summer Time on the 19th). Representatives of the railway unions left the White House minutes before the order. It is said that if the government takes over the railroads, the unions will order rail workers to leave their posts. When asked by reporters if the strike would proceed as scheduled, Fred N. Aten, president of the Railroad Employees' Department of the Railway Labor Executives Association, replied, "Yes." President Truman also issued a statement appealing to rail workers to remain in their posts and cooperate. According to White House sources, after the national railroad takeover, the Office of Defense Transportation will oversee traffic operations. The Railroad Employees' Department has 250,000 members. Once a strike is implemented, traffic on over 225,000 miles of trunk lines across the country will come to a standstill within a week. Furthermore, as raw materials and fuel cannot be transported, ocean-going ships will also be suspended, major domestic factories will be closed, and the national economy will gradually stagnate. The extent of the losses may take months or even years to recover.

Serious Impact of Railroad Labor Dispute

The railroad takeover will be implemented 24 hours before the strike, i.e., at 9 p.m. on Friday. This major railroad strike follows closely on the heels of recent labor disputes in the automobile manufacturing, electrical manufacturing, steel, copper, lead, and coal mining industries; hence its impact is bound to be severe. The coal miners' strike, which only ended on the 13th of this month after a 12-day work stoppage, has dealt a blow to American industry. The national railway system is also reducing train service due to a lack of coal.

Relief Supplies Cannot Be Shipped Out

According to United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) officials, if the railroad strike is implemented, relief supplies will be even more difficult to transport to the docks. These relief supplies were already insufficient, so there are no stockpiles at the docks for continued shipment. There are only a few coal briquettes, intended for shipment to Europe, which will be exhausted within a few days, after which there will also be a supply interruption. Meanwhile, according to the railroad unions, the strike order will not affect ambulances, troop trains, milk trucks, or the Illinois Central Railroad's 5,000-mile line, which has already been taken over by the government.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 18th broadcast: The Indian National Congress has indicated its acceptance of the proposals put forward by the British, and the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, will also formally respond to the British government tomorrow. The situation in India is expected to improve.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 18th dispatch] Gandhi urged the Indian people in his evening prayer meeting last night to accept the British Cabinet Mission's proposals for a "unified India" in order to sow the seeds of alleviating worries and suffering. He said that some people believe that the British cannot act in a regular manner, but he did not think so. The British Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy, like us, are God-fearing people. If we doubt them before they fulfill their words, we will lose our dignity.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 18th dispatch] Viceroy Wavell said in a broadcast yesterday that he was speaking to the people at the most important time in the history of India. The proposals were published after the most detailed study. He had hoped that Indian leaders could reach an agreement. The published proposals clearly do not fully meet the wishes of all parties. We are now offering India an opportunity for peace and complete independence. The domestic famine is a serious problem. He hopes that during the transition period, the Indian government will be handed over to Indian leaders, who will be the architects of a new India. This is the most important experiment in world history. Therefore, whether British, Muslims, Hindus, or the states, all must change their past faces to complete this experiment. We are currently between peace and internal strife; he hopes that everyone will act prudently.

British India Office Not Planning to Close

[Associated Press, London, 17th dispatch] An official of the India Office told reporters today that the department does not plan to close down immediately. When asked if the Secretary of State for India, Lord Pethick-Lawrence, had told reporters in New Delhi that the department had begun to clear up and would keep pace with the progress of Indian constitutionalism, the answer was that Lawrence's words meant a gradual transfer of power to India, which had been going on for several years. The number of staff in the India Office and the work undertaken by the Secretary of State for India have been greatly reduced. For example, in the area of trade, the work previously carried out by the India Office has now been taken over by the Indian Supply Committee. The future status of the India Office is related to the final treaty governing British-Indian relations and will depend on whether India decides to remain within the British Empire.

### Moscow Radio Broadcasts Claim that Spain Once Planned to Seize Gibraltar, but the Plan Was Not Realized Because Germany Abandoned Its Plan to Invade Britain

[Reuters, London, 18th dispatch] Moscow Radio broadcast yesterday the remarks of former German military attachés in Madrid and Tangier, General Klammt and Colonel Lehmann (both currently detained in the Soviet Union), claiming that Spain originally intended to seize Gibraltar, but the plan was not realized after Hitler abandoned his plan to invade Britain and instead launched an attack on the Soviet Union. Spain participated in German activities during the war, followed Berlin's orders, organized the "Blue Division" to fight against the Soviet Union, and German senior officers disguised themselves as Spanish soldiers and used neutral Spanish aircraft. Spanish radio stations were also used by German army and navy authorities to transmit military intelligence. In October 1940, the German military attaché in Madrid informed Lehmann that the Spanish army planned to attack Gibraltar and could occupy it in 20 minutes. The final date for the attack on Gibraltar was set for January 10, 1941. Spain would also participate in the war as a result. Spanish and Moroccan troops would be supplemented by German troops, and Spanish Morocco also intended to invade Oran. German and Spanish forces organized a joint army to prevent Allied landings in Portugal.

### Yoshida Cabinet in Japan Runs into Trouble; Liberal and Progressive Parties Unevenly Distribute Positions; Social Democratic Party Challenges the Cabinet

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 18th dispatch] The Yoshida Cabinet has not yet been successfully formed today. As of 5:30 p.m., only the following cabinet members have been decided: Tanzan Ishibashi as Minister of Finance, Raizo Iwata as Minister of Justice, Tsunejiro Hiratsuka as Minister of Transportation, and Shigeru Shidehara, Takao Saito, and Etsujiro Uehara as Ministers of State.

Therefore, it is still pushing for the addition of another cabinet member, showing that the Yoshida Cabinet is weak and difficult to form.

### New Mayor and His Wife Fly to Shanghai; Emphasis on Economy as Guiding Principle; Hopes that All Citizens of Shanghai Will Launch the Construction of a New Shanghai; Inauguration Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow Morning at Weekly Memorial Service

[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Wu Kuo-cheng, the new mayor of Shanghai, who has been meticulously planned by the city and eagerly awaited by a million citizens, arrived in Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Flight 111 from Nanjing at 5:25 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Huang Zhuo Xuan. After disembarking, Mr. Wu smiled and took a photo with Mayor Chien before boarding a car and heading directly to his residence at the Broadway Mansions to rest. Those who went to the airport to welcome him yesterday included Mayor Chien, Deputy Mayor Ho, Shen Shihua, Feng Youzhen, Zhao Zukang, Luo Zukang, Luo Xueqian, Wang Zhuyi, and the newly appointed Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, as well as Zhang Peter, the former chief of the International Propaganda Section, and over a hundred others.

After arriving on the 17th floor of the Broadway Mansions, Mr. Wu met with the city's press corps and gave a speech, saying: "I came to Shanghai once in April 1937, and it has been nine years since I last set foot in Shanghai. After arriving here, I would like to express four points: (1) I express my deepest sympathy for the suffering and mental anguish endured by the people of Shanghai during the eight years under enemy oppression. Mr. Wu said: We in the interior, though we suffered material hardship, the mental anguish was even greater than the physical. (2) This time coming to Shanghai, the first thing I want to do in the city government is to be economical. Mr. Wu believes that China's war of resistance was arduous, and it is still struggling in difficulties. Civil servants should establish a frugal ethos. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, the economic center, and the general standard is higher than other places. Therefore, I hope that all citizens of Shanghai will take the lead in building a new Shanghai, not only as an example for the whole country but also to shine before foreigners." When reporters asked about the

governing principles and city government organization, Mayor Wu replied that the administration must be based on practical problems, and to solve difficulties, we must find the root causes. Empty thoughts, though there may be, are not sure whether they are practical. Therefore, I cannot report on the governing principles for the time being. As for the personnel changes in the city government, the mayor said that he will retain the staff of each department. Even if officials resign, if the work is needed and the performance is excellent, they will be retained with a fair attitude and sincerely invited to serve the country. Mr. Wu deeply admires Mayor Chien for serving the society and the country during the most difficult times in Shanghai and said that he would consult with him on future administration. The issue of civil servant

treatment is a national problem. If you want to talk about enjoyment, it is absolutely impossible, even in the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, you must be thrifty and patient and overcome the difficulties together. However, the standard of living should be maintained no matter what. Otherwise, it will be impossible to be honest and hardworking and stay in the position. This matter will also be studied in detail after taking office. In addition, the various crises in the city's industry and commerce should also be removed. The local government should be assisted by the central government, but the central laws must be faithfully observed. The mayor has absolutely no news of this. The three bureaus will abolish the deputy director system, and other bureaus will be determined according to the work. The interview lasted thirty-five minutes. At 6:40 p.m., the mayor drove to visit President Song, and at 7:30 p.m. he attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Chien to discuss the city government

transfer and handover steps and date. Finally, the reporter learned that the changeover of the new and old mayors has been decided to be held at the City Hall memorial week tomorrow. After the handover procedure is completed, Mayor Chien will go to Nanjing and then return to his hometown of Suzhou to visit relatives and friends. As for Chien's new position, there is still much speculation, but according to a senior official in the city government, it is likely that he will take up an important position in the military.

Mr. Wu Kuo-cheng and his wife, the new mayor of Shanghai, were photographed at the airport by our reporter Gu Tingpeng.

### Fish Vendors Strike, Persuasion to Resume Business

[Our Newspaper's Report] For two days, fresh fish has been absent in Shanghai, causing the prices of fresh meat and vegetables to rise significantly. The strike of the 83 market fish vendors was caused by a dispute between four-wheeled carts (vehicles with two-wheeled trailers) and trucks competing for transportation at the fish market.

### Improving the Treatment of Civil Servants: Legislative Yuan's Proposed Suggestions Difficult to Implement; Chiang Menglin Arrives in Shanghai for Brief Talk

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chiang Menglin, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to attend today's Red Cross meeting (Mr. Chiang is the president of the association). Yesterday afternoon, he met with reporters at the Broadway Mansions and said that the reorganization of the Executive Yuan had largely come to an end. Mr. Chiang said that Vice President Weng Wenhao's resignation had been approved and he would continue to serve. Currently, the most important policy of the Executive Yuan is to find ways to suppress prices and solve the difficult living conditions of civil servants. However, it is impossible to implement the Legislative Yuan's suggestion on civil servant treatment. The main reason for rising prices is the limited sources of supply. Domestic transportation is blocked. The government spends manpower and financial resources to repair transportation repeatedly, but it is repeatedly destroyed by the Communist Party, making transportation hopeless. If the North-South transportation is opened up, prices will fall, and there will be no problem. Mr. Chiang will return to Beijing tomorrow after the Red Cross meeting.

### Girl Swindler Case: Debate Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled; Wang Guoying, Close to Tears; Sun Gongdu's Analogy of Egg Hitting Stone

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of the female swindler Wang Guoying, who used the excuse of rescuing traitors to defraud a huge sum of 5 million (currency unspecified), concluded its debate yesterday, and the sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 25th of this month. Yesterday, Wang was still wearing a light gray suit, a red-and-white polka-dot tie, and pale yellow champagne leather shoes, but her "masculinized" face was paler than before. She wiped her eyes with a handkerchief, but no tears flowed, only rubbing her eyes red. Sun Gongdu and Zhang Weisheng were both wearing gray-black long gowns, with shaved heads, while Sun's face was darker. After Judge Cao questioned the witnesses one by one, including Wu Bingquan (brother of Wu Yonghua), Cao Wensheng (Wu's neighbor), Zhao Jianzhi (employee of the Qianzhuang), Hou Yonghua (manager of the Litai Qianzhuang), Weng Yongquan (staff member of the Xincheng Branch Judicial Section), Chen Lizhang (owner of the car company), Rong Xuefen (telephone operator at the Jinmen Hotel), Li Junfa (car driver), Zhang Daishi (wife of Zhang Weisheng), Sun Lishi (wife of Sun Gongdu), and Zhang Shuyuan, a greeter at the Jinmen Hotel, the lawyers were instructed to debate. Wang Guoying's defense lawyer, Ma Nangeng, said: To prove fraud, there must be material evidence. The police searched the defendant's room and found nothing, which shows a false accusation. All witnesses unfavorable to the defendant are relatives of the plaintiff and cannot be said to be factual evidence. Subsequently, Chen Wenju, the defense lawyer for the two defendants Sun and Zhang, claimed that the defendants were enthusiastic about helping people and were deceived by Wang Guoying, and did not commit joint fraud. The court declared the debate concluded and asked the defendants if they had anything to say. Wang Guoying said that Sun Gongdu proposed to her and borrowed money twice without success, and held a grudge, resulting in her being poisoned. "Law and reason have 70% human emotion," she asked the judge to uphold justice. Sun Gongdu said, "This time, I knew it was an egg hitting a stone, but for the sake of friends, to protect righteousness, I had to risk breaking this stone egg." Finally, he said in a stern tone: "Before I entered the police station, I still thought she was a commissioner of the National Government. How did I know she was a "menstrual belt" commissioner!" (Note: At the last trial, Wang Guoying said that all the gold bars were brought from Chongqing for buying menstrual belts.) The court adjourned at 4:35 PM.

### Trial of Xu Xiqing, Acting Editor-in-Chief of the Zhonghua Daily; Promotes Fallacies; Confesses to Serving in Puppet Positions; Two Puppet Officials Each Sentenced to Two and a Half Years in Prison

[Our Newspaper's Report] The traitors tried yesterday included Xu Xiqing, the acting editor-in-chief of the puppet Zhonghua Daily, Huang Liewen, the puppet county magistrate of Qingpu County, Yu Jianhong, the puppet county magistrate of Jiaxing County, Huang Yuan, the deputy general manager of the puppet Central Trust Company, Zhou Hang, [missing text] in the puppet Shaoxing enemy military police, and Zhao [missing text] Xilin, an office worker in the puppet [missing text] government and enemy military police translator. Details are as follows:

Xu Xiqing, from Kaiping, Guangdong, 40 years old, served as the acting editor-in-chief of the puppet Zhonghua Daily in 1940. After May 1941, he merged the puppet Zhonghua United News Agency and the Zhonghua News Agency into the "Central Censorship News Agency," serving as the [missing text] and deputy president. From 1940 to 1943, he also served as a [missing text] in the puppet Propaganda Department, overseeing all puppet propaganda duties, and contacted the enemy Allied Press to exchange news. He promoted the "peace" movement in the puppet newspaper, advocated "Greater East Asia," and sang the fallacy of "China" and Japan living and dying together, coexisting and co-prospering, inciting people's emotions and enslaving the people's minds. In May 1943, he became the Deputy Director of the Puppet Central Youth Cadre School. On January 2, 1945, he became the Deputy Secretary of the Puppet New National Movement Committee. In May 1945, he became the Deputy Dean of the Puppet Anhui Zhongshan College and other cultural puppet positions. Xu was a member of the Kuomintang, wearing a blue cloth long gown, yellow leather shoes, with thick eyebrows and a small face, slightly bald on top, speaking a bluish official language, and confessed to serving in the puppet positions. However, he claimed that the opinions of the puppet Zhonghua Daily were presided over by the "Investigation Department" and had nothing to do with him. The students of the puppet "Central Youth Cadre School" were transferred from various public and private middle schools and were not instilled with poisonous ideas. As for the "New National Movement," he said that it was another name for the New Life Movement, which was to improve the national life and education.

Huang Liewen, the puppet Qingpu County Magistrate, with a shaved head and a round face, wore highly myopic glasses. He was originally an underground worker sent to the occupied areas by the Third [missing text] District. He was arrested by Su [name missing] De, the puppet secret agent leader, and imprisoned in Nanjing for six months starting in May 1943. Later, in June 1944, he was arrested by "76," and after being released, he secretly reported Du Gang, who was then murdered. Huang was rewarded for this and became the puppet Qingpu County Magistrate. At the start of the trial, Huang tried to deny it. Lawyer Lu Huimin, the wife of Martyr Du, testified in court, but Zhang Yulin, Bin Hou, and Lieutenant Colonel Guan Ben, the three witnesses, did not arrive. Another witness, Du Bingrong, testified that he was doing underground work in Qingpu and was rescued by Huang, which was favorable to the defendant.

Jin Jianhong, from Changshu, 61 years old, was the puppet Jiaxing County Magistrate. Before the war, he served as the county magistrate of Ruian and other counties in Zhejiang, and resigned due to illness and returned to Suzhou to live in idleness. After the Anti-Japanese War, because his family was divided, he took the puppet county administration training course organized by the puppet civil affairs department of the puppet miscellaneous salary government. After graduating, he served as the Jiaxing County Magistrate until September 1942, when he was dismissed due to old age. During his tenure, he plundered supplies for enemy use and harmed innocent people. Jin confessed to serving in the puppet positions but denied all crimes.

Huang Yuan, from Zhongshan, 38 years old, served in the diplomatic circles before the war. In 1938, he came to Shanghai and, through Chen Jinwan's introduction, served as a secretary and counselor in the puppet Ministry of Finance and as the secretary and deputy general manager of the board of directors of the puppet Central Trust Company. He oversaw the financial hub of the puppet organization, purchased all goods for the puppet government, and specialized in disrupting the market and finance, harming merchants and people. Huang claimed that he was either a nominal position or for administrative work, trying to cover up his traitorous crimes.

Zhou Hang, from Liaoning, 32 years old, graduated from a puppet "Manchukuo" middle school in 1939 and was sent by enemy military police Matsui to Hangzhou, serving as a translator in the translation section of the puppet Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department. At the end of May 1944, he was transferred to the enemy military police in Shaoxing as a translator. According to his confession, he served in the puppet position for only four years. Starting on May 1, 1945, he joined the Zhongyi Save the Nation Army led by Ma Zhichao and served as an adjutant in the Xiaoshao Action [missing text] Team, so he also contributed to the resistance war.

Zhao Xilin, from Zhenjiang, 43 years old, joined the puppet "Dadashi Government" in 1938 as an office worker. In April 1940, he was introduced by Wang Yougen to serve as a translator in the enemy Sugiura military police, and later transferred to the puppet Construction Department police Shanghai section inspector. He arrested underground comrades Zhou Fei and Feng Zili, and also introduced Qiu Wenqing and Li Chunhua to be enemy military police translators. Zhao denied all of this.

Sentencing of Two Traitor Cases

The Special Criminal Court of the High Court sentenced Fang Lixiang, secretary of the puppet Propaganda Department, and Ye Zhihua, deputy director of the Hongkou levy office of the Shishan district levy branch of the puppet Jiangsu stamp tax bureau, to two and a half years in prison each for conspiring with the enemy country and plotting to resist the country. Their civil rights were deprived for two years, and all property was confiscated except for what was necessary for the family's living expenses.

Conclusion of Debate in Three Cases

The cases of Li Yimin (from Anhui), an inspector of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Shu Jingen (from Zhenjiang), a Chinese laborer of the enemy army's 1629th unit, and Qian Nengxia (from Qingpu), director of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Economic Bureau, have been concluded after debate and are scheduled to be sentenced on the afternoon of the 25th.

### Founding of Chengzhong Middle School Founder Ye Chengzhong Re-erects Bronze Statue Today Inauguration Ceremony Presided Over by Director Gu of the Bureau of Education

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Chengzhong Middle School on Tangshan Road in this city was founded during the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty by Ye Chengzhong, a wealthy businessman from Zhenhai who made his fortune as a bamboo craftsman. It was the first privately funded private school in our country. During the Anti-Japanese War, all the school buildings were destroyed by the Japanese invaders, and all the school equipment was looted. The bronze statue of the founder, Ye Chengzhong, originally built on campus, was also secretly taken away by Japanese ruffians and almost melted down into weapons during the Japanese army's indiscriminate requisition of copper and iron. After the victory, a portion of the school buildings were repaired, and classes resumed. The bronze statue of the founder, Ye Chengzhong, was recently brought back to its original location and re-erected. The inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held today (the 19th) at 10:00 a.m., presided over by Gu De, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education. At that time, the school plans to print and distribute a biography of Ye Chengzhong and a record of the re-erection of the bronze statue as a commemoration. The biography is divided into the following sections:

Ye Chengzhong's Biography "Ye Chengzhong's Biography": Ye Chengzhong, courtesy name Chengzhong, was a native of Zhenhai, Zhejiang. His family was engaged in agriculture. His father was Zhiyu, and his mother was from the Hong family. He was the second of three brothers. He lost his father at the age of six and lived with his widowed mother and brothers, experiencing hardship. At the age of nine, he began to study with a private tutor, but after less than half a year, he dropped out of school due to poverty to help his mother with farm work. At the age of fourteen, he worked as an apprentice in a store, earning only one thousand coins a year. The mistress of the store treated him poorly, but Chengzhong remained calm and diligent in his work. After two years, his mother asked someone to speak to the store owner to request a raise of half his annual salary. Upon hearing this, the mistress said sternly, "With his talent, what he receives is already excessive. How can this be allowed?" Chengzhong heard her words and quietly left, being only sixteen years old at the time. At that time, the Treaty of Nanjing had just been concluded, and Shanghai was opened as a commercial port. Ningbo people set sail across the sea, arriving every month. Chengzhong returned home disappointed, bid farewell to his mother, and followed his neighbor Ni, boarding a boat northward. However, he had no means of paying for passage. He asked the boatman, "May I help you steer the boat in exchange for waiving my fare?" Everyone on board said, "Good!" After half a month, they arrived in Shanghai. Standing on the Bund, he had no idea what to do. A certain person, who had a small shop on the Bund, saw him and asked him the reason. Chengzhong told him everything. The person admired his ambition and allowed him to stay overnight. Chengzhong thought to himself that his knowledge was insufficient, but he could contribute with his strength. So, he carried bags for people every day, not shirking fatigue. He had enough to eat and drink and even saved money to lend to the store owner. The owner saw that he was diligent and honest, so he taught him arithmetic at night. After a year, he accumulated several thousand coins. He consulted with the store owner and began to row a boat to sell vegetables and fruits to British warships, offering fair prices and being punctual. The people on the ships all knew of his honesty, and when their tours of duty were up, they would be sure to tell each other about Chengzhong. As a result, his business flourished. Later, some officers from a warship boarded his boat and left a box on the boat. Chengzhong did not notice it at first. When he arrived at the wharf, he saw the box and realized that someone had lost it. He immediately waited by the boat. Soon, the person rowed over. Chengzhong returned the box to him. The person was overjoyed and reached into his pocket to offer him money, but he refused, saying, "I dare not accept ill-gotten gains." As a result, his reputation spread far and wide. When the store owner retired due to old age and illness, he handed the store over to Chengzhong, marking the beginning of his business career. In the first year of Tongzhi, he established Shunji Hardware Store in Hongkou, becoming the pioneer of the hardware industry in Shanghai. Westerners recognized his honesty and were happy to trade with him. Eventually, through diligence and thrift, and by treating people with honesty and integrity, his business expanded day by day. Within a few years, branch stores were established in various trading ports. He also established match and silk reeling factories in Shanghai and Hankou, with grand scale, pioneering industry and commerce, and curbing the outflow of wealth, demonstrating his far-sightedness. Later, he realized that accumulating wealth should also involve distributing wealth. Therefore, he generously donated to any public welfare cause. In his later years, while passing through Zhangjiawan in Hongkou, he saw a group of children running barefoot on the beach. He felt sorry for them and said to his friend, "I was orphaned and poor in my youth, and I always regretted not having a university education. Now I see the children of Zhangjiawan playing wildly, which must be because they have nothing to learn. I should buy land and build a school here so that the children can learn and prepare for society. I have made up my mind. Will you help me with this?" His friend said, "Good." So, they jointly bought more than eighteen acres of land, donated two hundred thousand taels of silver, and hired workers to prepare materials. After two years, the construction was completed, which is now Chengzhong Middle School. In the beginning, Westerners such as Fu Kaisen and Li Jiabai tried to prevent its completion, saying that it would be better to follow the example of Nie Zhongcheng, who donated land to establish a school and entrusted the operation to the Engineering Bureau, or that it would be better to set up a hospital to provide medical care to the poor. But he did not waver in his resolve and politely declined, showing the firmness of his will. When the school was about to open, he suddenly fell ill. He instructed Yanghu Zai Yuanruo, a historian, to write a couplet to be hung in the auditorium, which read: "I was orphaned and traveled to Shanghai in my youth, and I regretted that I was old and had not achieved anything, like walking in the dark and thinking of holding a candle"; "Now I have built a lecture hall for young children, hoping that they will study diligently and cherish every minute." Before he passed away, he sent a letter to the school board members Fan Chen and others, saying, "Chengzhong was orphaned and poor in his youth, and he regretted not having an education. He has long wanted to establish a school to help poor children. Now that the matter is just beginning, he is suffering from illness and fears that he will not live to see its completion. Gentlemen, you have been friends for a long time and will surely understand my humble intentions and strive to complete this undertaking, hoping that students will flourish and contribute to the country." His concern for the school was so great, and he can be said to have been loyal to the country. He passed away at the age of fifty-eight in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. Tang Jingchong, the Qing Dynasty's educational commissioner, learned of his deeds and petitioned for commendation and ordered the National History Museum to write his biography.

A Record of the Re-erection of the Bronze Statue "A Record of the Re-erection of the Bronze Statue": The statue was built in the summer of the tenth year of the Republic, marking the school's twentieth anniversary. At that time, the school board members were Chen Ruihai, Wang Haifan, Xiang Rusong, Zhang Qinxuan, Cao Lanbin, Ma Shuping, Cen Tingkang, Ye Yuhan, and Ye Xiangang. The head of the school was Cao Muguan from Shangyu. The author of the inscription was Jiang Zhiru from Zhuji. The calligrapher was Yu Tiansui from Kunshan. The person who unveiled the statue was Wang Zhengting from Fenghua. In the autumn of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, when the enemy invaded Shanghai, the school staff scattered. After the initial fall, everything was looted. On April 12 of the following year, the invaders colluded with hooligans to remove the statue from its base and carry it through the streets on the shoulders of ten people. Someone recognized it and reported it to the school. School board member Ye Xiangang and Principal Wu Cuilun met with the authorities and stored it in the police station because the school was a prohibited area and there was nothing to say. After seven years, in July of the thirty-fourth year, the enemy indiscriminately requisitioned copper and iron. The head of the Shanghai East Police Bureau came to the school and forced me to hand over the statue. I was terrified and unable to respond, so I used polite words to stall. After a month or so, the enemy's surrender was near, and I was relieved that it was safe. Now it has been brought back and re-erected. Is this not due to the spirit of the former headmaster in heaven? The only regret is that the original draft of the inscription is lost. Alas, how sad!

### Director of the Temporary National University Preparatory Class Summons Graduates for Discussion Introduces Those Proficient in Japanese to Serve in Taiwan Province

[Beiping News from Dahuashe] Chen Xueping, Director of the Temporary National University Preparatory Class in Beiping, recently summoned the graduates of this year's class in the activity room of the Second Branch for a discussion. He first emphasized: After graduation, students should not have expectations that are too high, but they should also not underestimate themselves. They should maintain a thirst for knowledge and strive forward. Then, he gave four points of guidance: (1) Regarding employment, according to the previous survey of service aspirations, the results show that 250 people intend to serve in Beiping. He is currently working closely with various agencies to find ways to secure proper employment. Those proficient in Japanese can be introduced to serve in Taiwan. (2) Regarding diplomas, the issue has already been resolved. The students' opinions have already been conveyed on their behalf in Chongqing. The National Southwestern Associated University believes that since they have never seen the students, they cannot issue diplomas. In this extraordinary period, the Temporary National University Preparatory Class diploma also has precedents to follow. If you must obtain a university diploma, you can re-enroll after graduation, but he hopes that not everyone will do so. (3) The graduation exam was originally scheduled for the end of June, but because the National Southwestern Associated University will return to the north soon, the Temporary National University Preparatory Class will end on June 24 ahead of schedule. (4) Regarding the issue of food and lodging for the graduates, he is currently negotiating with the authorities to find a solution.

### Zhejiang Province's Educational Reconstruction Funds Ministry of Education Allocates Another 200 Million Yuan

[Hangzhou News from Dahuashe] The Zhejiang Provincial Education Authority had previously requested 6.05 billion yuan from the central government for educational reconstruction expenses. As a result, the Ministry of Education only allocated 60 million yuan first and borrowed 50 million yuan from local banks. Recently, although it received 200 million yuan allocated by the central government, after returning it to the local bank, only 145 million yuan remained, which is a huge difference from the original reconstruction budget. However, it is heard that in the future distribution, most of it is planned to be allocated to various provincial schools as necessary repair or equipment funds. In addition, provincial public education centers, provincial sports grounds, provincial libraries, and other social education institutions are waiting to resume activities, and a portion of this fund will be used to cover the expenses of the above institutions. Therefore, the distribution is still very difficult. The Municipal Bureau of Education Temporarily Decides to Provide Relief

### Rice Prices Surge Again Yesterday, Rising by 7-8,000 Yuan; Public Food Issue Intensifies; President Song Instructs on Suppression Measures

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the rice market's upward momentum intensified, with prices skyrocketing. Both Geng rice and Xian rice varieties surged by a massive 7-8,000 yuan. Flour also followed suit, rising by another 1,000 yuan. The oil market also rose with other commodities, jumping by 6-7,000 to 8-9,000 yuan. Soybean cake followed, rising by 6-700 yuan. Soybeans were highly competitive, with prices soaring by 3-4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts rose by 1,000 yuan, and high-quality mung beans saw an increase of 1-2,000 yuan, while medium-grade remained stable. Corn also increased by over 1,000 yuan, but red sorghum remained steady. Bran was scarcely traded. Yesterday, the city's rice arrival, according to the rice market, was over 4,000 shi, with the types and quantities as follows:

White Geng: 1,993 shi, Du Xian: 475 shi, Bo Dao: 667 shi, Wu Xian: 120 shi, Early Rice: 832 shi, Wan Xian: 110 shi.

Furthermore, the city's overall food situation has reached its most critical stage. Prices of all goods have surged to unprecedented heights, causing widespread anxiety. It is understood that the total rice reserves in the city exceed one million shi. Of this amount, 40% is distributed among various households, 40% is the operating stock of rice shops, and 20% is illegally controlled by major households. Currently, some bank warehouses are storing these rice stocks for extended periods. Moreover, supply routes continue uninterrupted. Therefore, the frequent surges in rice prices in the city are purely due to the illegal activities of unscrupulous rice merchants. However, the authorities have yet to take decisive measures to severely punish them, which is regrettable.

President Song Cares About Public Food

[Central News Agency, This City] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Song Ziwen, deeply concerned about the soaring rice prices affecting people's livelihoods, specially summoned Xu Jilou, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Xueyu, and others yesterday morning. He provided detailed instructions on expediting the transport of Sichuan rice eastward, purchasing foreign rice, and planning to appeal to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for assistance to supplement the food supply and thoroughly suppress grain prices. He also met with General Georgeson, Director of the U.S. Army Surplus Property Administration Committee, to inquire about relevant matters. In the afternoon around 5 p.m., Premier Song also met with Wu Kaixian, reportedly discussing matters related to resolving the labor unrest in the city.

Social Affairs Bureau Orders Investigation into Rice Hoarding

[Central News Agency, This City] The rice reserves in this city are not lacking, and supplies arrive continuously, with daily arrivals ranging from at least 5-6,000 bags to 12,000 bags or more. However, the recent surge in rice prices indicates that unscrupulous merchants are hoarding and manipulating prices to seek illegal profits. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the city's Warehouse Industry Association to promptly investigate and report a list of the current grain reserves in each warehouse, the names and quantities of depositors, and the dates of deposit, for verification. Meanwhile, market supervision will be strengthened, and any illegal trading activities will be immediately reported for legal action.

[East China News Agency] City Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, accompanied by Labor Association Chairman Zhu Xuefan, recently went to the central government in Nanjing to report on their duties and request instructions on handling the labor unrest in Shanghai. After completing their tasks, they returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. An East China News Agency reporter interviewed Wu to inquire about his views on the soaring rice prices. According to him, the recent surge in rice prices has drawn urgent attention from all sectors. He is deeply concerned and believes that to suppress grain prices, it is essential to effectively unblock supply channels and prevent market supply disruptions. Wu also stated that he advocates implementing rice rationing. The current Baojia system in the city has been established, and the government can utilize Baojia to distribute rice to citizens at low prices, which could potentially resolve the public food problem.

Special Envoy Goes to Nanjing for Instructions

[Our Dispatch] The upward momentum of the rice market continued unabated yesterday. Our reporter specially visited the Acting Special Envoy of the Grain Administration, Mr. Wang Daren. According to Wang, he had visited the Municipal Government Secretary-General, Mr. He DeKui, yesterday morning due to the repeated surges in rice prices. Mr. He expressed great concern about the matter. Wang then stated that the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation has ordered three batches of foreign rice in the past two days: the first batch of 8,000 tons, the second batch of 9,600 tons, and the third batch of one million bags (each bag weighing 60 kilograms, equivalent to 120 jin), which will be successively shipped to the city. The estimated price upon arrival in Shanghai is approximately 35,000 yuan per shi, making the continued rise in rice prices perplexing. Wang will take the night train to Nanjing last night to seek instructions from the Minister of Food, Mr. Xu Kan.

### Yarn Prices Steadily Rise in Shanghai; Spot Supply Insufficient

Yesterday, the yarn market saw a sudden surge. Tianjin buyers showed a particular preference for old brands of Japanese mills, such as Sun Brand, Fengnian, Shuiyue, and Lanfeng, in the 20-count yarn category. The price of 20-count Sun Brand skyrocketed from 1.15 million to 1.23 million, a jump of 100,000 compared to the previous day. Due to this, 20-count Double Horse yarn also gradually increased to 1.28 million. Other small and medium-sized yarns, with fewer buyers, only increased by 2-30,000. 42-count double-ply yarn remained highly sought after, with Lanfeng closing at a new high of 2.45 million, and the spot supply remained insufficient.

The cloth market was influenced by the soaring gold and yarn prices, leading to higher prices. The Textile Construction Corporation offered 26 types of cloth for sale, along with 15 types of American and Mexican cloth.

In the flower market, New York American cotton prices fell by 7-16 points. The recent price for American dollars was 27.15, the forward price was 27.62, and the current price for Michelin was 27.75. Cotton trading in this city was relatively active, with private yarn mills such as Xinsheng, Dasheng, and Shenxin No. 1 all making purchases, and smaller trades also occurring among industry members.

### Tea Market Remains Stable

Inspecting the qualities of red and green tea, Tianjin buyers' appetite has decreased, while sales in local shops and in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places are very smooth. However, only low-grade teas are selling well, with less demand for high-grade teas. Prices have remained relatively stable due to balanced supply and demand, and have not seen significant fluctuations. As for Zhenmei and Te Chou Gongxi teas, which are sold exclusively abroad, according to news from Jardine Matheson and Ruichang trading companies, they are still interested in importing teas with consistent quality. It is also reported that a tea company in this city recently received a telegram from Morocco, stating that Zhenmei green tea is in high demand, but due to various reasons, export sales are still difficult to improve significantly.

### Sugar Prices Trending Slightly Lower; Cotton White Manufacturers Request Tax Exemption

Yesterday, the Sugar Association quoted 67,000 yuan for medium-grade white sugar, a slight decrease of over 1,000 yuan. Raw sugar remained unchanged at 57,000 yuan. Third-grade white sugar Association warehouse warrants were quoted at 74,000 to 74,500 yuan, and second-grade white sugar third-grade carload was quoted at 65,000 yuan. Chao Tang (teacart) Zhuang Qing (color) was quoted at 60,000 yuan. The purchase of goods from this manufacturer was not completed due to the tax on goods and the complicated procedures. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials (medium-grade sugar) is high, resulting in high production costs. The prices of three-grade cars are approaching white prices, therefore little or no profit may be made. There is more concern about losing money, resulting in most cotton manufacturers shutting down. They are requesting a tax exemption, with the reasoning that middle-grade white has already been taxed so also collecting taxes on the white cotton amounts to double taxation on the same good. If the tax exemption is hopeless, then the cotton can not continue to be cooked, and then the price is expected to jump by about three to five cars.

### Tianjin and Shanghai Pig Bristles Awaiting Shipment

Pig bristles are sluggish in the United States, so the Shanghai market is not as active as last month. Currently, the price of Shanghai 17 bristles has dropped to 400,000 yuan per customs tael (关祖) within the customs, and there are still few inquiries. Pig bristles from Chongqing and Tianjin, due to their better quality, are still occasionally purchased by various exporters. It is reported that the Central Trust Bureau's Purchasing Department has recently purchased 4-5,000 boxes in Chongqing, Hankou, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Combined with previous purchases, the total exceeds 10,000 boxes, which are currently being concentrated in Tianjin and Shanghai, awaiting export.

### Indian Cotton Export Allowed Before April 13th

Fully Prohibited Starting May 11th

[Reuters, Bombay, 18th] The Indian government has issued a notice stating that all cotton exports before April 13th will receive government permission. Exports between April 13th and May 11th will be approved or denied based on their nature. Exports after May 11th will not be approved, meaning that cotton exports will be completely prohibited.

### Increased Buyers, Tight Market; Gold Price Exceeds 1.9 Million Mark; U.S. Dollar Also Rises by 80 Yuan

Spot gold prices gradually increased under heavy buying from the public, with unanimous optimism. Supply was insufficient and the number of lots for sale were thinning. Thus, although prices opened steadily in the morning, they tended towards firmness after trading opened. Gold prices in other locations were higher than in this city, and rumors circulated on the streets and in alleys, encouraging buying. Around 10 a.m., prices rose to around 1.86 million. The Bank of China allocated 365 bars to the industry at a price of 1.85 million. After the allocation was completed, prices immediately rose to 1.88 million and then hovered around that level. Prices retreated to 1.86 million, but holders had great expectations, leading to a tight market. At noon, prices finally exceeded the 1.9 million mark. In the afternoon, prices rose to around 1.92 million before stabilizing. As a result, prices closed up 90,000 compared to the previous close. Silver jewelry was priced at 200,300. Taels of silver rose slightly to 1,700, silver dollars rose slightly to 1,150 with buyers. The interest rate was balanced at one cent and a half to one cent and eight points.

Foreign currency, specifically U.S. dollars, followed the gold market's rise, gradually increasing from an opening of 2,310 yuan in the morning. Foreign firms, seeing the unfavorable trend, made some purchases. In the afternoon, they were subjected to selling, thus prices pushed past 2,400. The afternoon trend continued to be strong. The arbitrage against gold widened to around 790 yuan per 10 taels, which made it appropriate to lead to buying. As a result, prices closed up another 80 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes were stable, closing up 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was adjusted upwards to around 425 yuan by a foreign firm with flowered garments. The Robi (Japanese currency) was the same, rising strongly to 525 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate was slightly higher.

### Gold Prices Continue to Rise in Various Locations

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] Today, the black market price of gold remains stable at 200,300 yuan, and the price of U.S. dollars is 2,480 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The price of gold continues to rise to 204,500 yuan, the price of U.S. dollars is 2,210 yuan, and the price of Hong Kong dollars is 416 yuan. The price of rice has fallen back, with high-grade rice at 62,000 yuan per 100 jin, and medium-grade rice at 55,000 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] Today, grain prices have fallen. Rice is priced at 490 yuan per jin, local flour is priced at 27,200 yuan per bag, gold is priced at 200,650 yuan, and U.S. dollars are priced at 2,525 yuan.

[Our Dispatch, Wuxi, 18th] The price of rice has exceeded 60,000 yuan, and silver jewelry is selling for 205,000 yuan.

### Government Bonds Continue to Decline; Only China Textiles and Yong Tai Yarn Perform Well

Government bonds struggled to rally yesterday, but short sellers saw opportunities for profit and made slight adjustments. The overall trend remained stable. The morning opening price of the C-Type Bond (統丙) was slightly lower at 6,600 yuan, but then fell to a low of 6,400 yuan. Short sellers saw a net profit of over 1,000 yuan and slightly covered their positions at lower prices, pushing the price up to 6,750 yuan. Ultimately, the price remained below the morning opening price at noon, as speculative funds favored gold and dollars. The closing price was down 100 yuan compared to the previous close. A-type and B-type bonds were down 250 yuan, D-type bonds were down 200 yuan, and E-type bonds were down 100 yuan. Buying interest in Chinese stocks gradually increased, but the overall market had not yet recovered. Only China Textiles and Yong Tai Yarn were performing well. Yong Tai Yarn was stimulated by the upcoming shareholder meeting and performed much better than Meyer, gradually increasing from 5,000 yuan to 5,350 yuan. Meyer increased from 4,080 yuan to 4,250 yuan, but then lacked momentum. Most speculative funds flowed to gold and dollars, and prices closed lower at noon. Small stocks such as Jingfu remained weak and failed to make any progress. The closing prices of Yong Tai Yarn was slightly up. Meyer stocks fell slightly, and stocks of Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing also declined slightly. Foreign stocks rebounded after falling to a low point, with mixed results compared to the previous close.

### Chinese Tungsten and Antimony to be Exported Soon

[Reuters, London, 18th] The London metal industry expects that China will export tungsten ore and antimony in the near future. Antimony and tungsten are important export commodities of China, accounting for two-thirds of the world's needs. At the same time, London's inventory is extremely scarce, but it is believed that the government's stored tungsten is quite abundant.

### 1,000 Bales of Chinese Silk to be Shipped to the U.S.

According to Sun Bohuo, director of the business department of the China Sericulture Company, last month the company had 500 bales of raw silk waiting to be exported, but due to the lack of time, the shipment was delayed. Therefore, the quantity of this shipment has also increased, totaling 1,000 bales, which are scheduled to be shipped to the U.S. on the 28th of this month.

### Central Trust Bureau Sells Silk Fabrics, etc., Bidding Opens Yesterday; 50,000 Feet of Lumber Not Awarded

The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the sale of government materials and property, conducted its fourth auction of materials, including 3,129 pieces of various fabrics, 209 packages of yarn, 45 large boxes of 120-count Jin Sanma rayon, 500 bundles of 120-count miscellaneous rayon, and 2,000 empty iron barrels. The deadline for submitting bids was 12:00 noon yesterday, and the bidding opened at 3:00 p.m., supervised by personnel from the Shanghai Audit Office of the Auditing Department and the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property. According to the person in charge of the auction, the first auction of 50,000 cubic meters of lumber did not result in any winners because the highest bid was lower than the internal reserve price. In the second auction of 3,190 pieces of various fabrics and some packages of yarn, the winners were Tong Taichang, Yongchang, Hong Dachang, and three other cotton fabric companies. In the third auction of 211 boxes of rayon, 138 small packages of yarn, 120 packages of yarn, 84 bundles and 74 small packages of fine cloth, and 76 bundles of 42-count Lanfeng double-strand thread, the sole winner was Heng Kang Yarn and Thread Company.

### Predictions for the Wool Fabric Market Vary Widely

Yesterday, apart from Pai Lisi, Fan Li, Xiang Yu yarn, gabardine, and thick serge, which had some retail sales, there was little activity in the wool fabric market. Standard market conditions remained ostensibly stable but internally weak. Industry insiders had different opinions regarding the future market prospects. Those who expected prices to fall believed that prices in various parts of China had risen by 4,000 to 10,000 times the average level in 1937, while prices in foreign countries such as the U.S., Britain, and Australia had only risen by several hundred or a little over a thousand times. Therefore, the actual price of imported wool fabrics would be much cheaper than the prices in Shanghai. Moreover, with the current gold and rice frenzy, the cost of tailoring a suit had risen to over 100,000 or even 200,000 yuan. The public was struggling to afford food and daily necessities, and would naturally economize on semi-luxury goods such as wool fabrics. Therefore, they predicted that the future supply of wool fabrics would be abundant, and market prices would inevitably fall, and sales would definitely be more sluggish than at present. However, some others believed that there was no need to be pessimistic because the recent orders were incomplete in terms of patterns and colors. Although the prices were low, there were few direct manufacturers, and foreign trading companies were earning substantial profits by acting as intermediaries. Orders placed before the war did not have fixed foreign exchange rates, but now they all had fixed rates, and the cost of interest over four to five months would also increase invisibly. In the current environment, everything remained volatile. There was the possibility of continued adjustments to foreign exchange rates and taxes, and shipping and import procedures could not be as efficient as before. The cost of living was unlikely to decrease in the short term, local production was lacking, and costs were increasing. They predicted that the arrival of goods in large quantities would not be as ideal as expected by the end of the year.

### The National Goods Factories Federation Appeals on Behalf of Robbed Cotton Mill Owners, Providing Proof of the Circumstances

Yesterday afternoon, the National Goods Factories Federation held its first board of directors meeting of the current term. It was resolved to appoint Executive Director Zhang Zilian as the authorized representative to appeal to the highest authorities for the return of the remaining cotton cloth looted by the enemy, in order to alleviate the difficulties faced by businessmen. The document stated, "In August 1943, the enemy puppets forcibly purchased cotton cloth in Shanghai, causing heavy losses to the victimized manufacturers. After the victory, there was still a portion of the remaining cotton cloth, which was transferred by the Puppet Business Association to the Enemy Property Administration Bureau for receipt. This remaining cotton cloth originally belonged to dyeing and weaving and cotton cloth mill owners, and it was their only remaining blood and sweat. Therefore, the city's dyeing and weaving industry and the cotton cloth and cotton yarn business trade associations have repeatedly petitioned for consideration of the merchants' difficulties and for the return of the cotton cloth. Among them, several companies such as Yongxin, Yongchang, and Licheng had been approved for return by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau. Subsequently, the bureau's review committee overturned the approved cases, arguing that the enemy puppets' method of purchasing cotton cloth was favorable and that the merchants had not suffered much loss, and transferred the cotton cloth to the China Textile Construction Corporation for auction. This has left the 3,000+ victimized factories with no recourse. Consequently, cotton cloth merchants went on strike for two days. During his years in the rear area, Zilian was ordered to handle relief efforts. After returning to Shanghai after the victory, he heard that the enemy puppets' purchase of cotton cloth was indeed a forced purchase at low prices, and there were absolutely no favorable circumstances. As a result, cotton cloth mill owners went bankrupt and shut down. It is therefore believed that the remaining cotton cloth should be returned to show the government's concern for the people. We hereby respectfully report to you and request that you instruct the Enemy Property Administration Bureau to consider returning the cotton cloth so that the closed factories can resume operations as soon as possible and the hundred thousand unemployed workers can return to work. We await your urgent instructions. National Goods Factories Federation of Shanghai, Authorized Representative Zhang Zilian."

### Changchun in Twenty-Nine Days

— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

Continued from Yesterday's First Page

This reporter estimates that Changchun cannot be defended unless the National Army advancing north from Sipingjie can reach it quickly. However, as of this day, only one piece of news was obtained in Changchun: the New First Army is 66.9 miles from Changchun, vague and unclear about the specific situation.

Defending Changchun are the Second and Fourth Security Regiments, including six regiments. The Changchun police have eight branch bureaus, one police brigade, including six companies, totaling over 1,000 people. In addition, there are two police regiments of the Jilin Provincial Government that retreated from Jiutai, approximately 2,000+ people. These three groups total about 12,000 people, which is the entire force defending Changchun.

Here, it must be pointed out that the Security Regiment was airlifted from Beiping at the beginning of this year. In the past, it was the "Iron and Stone Troops" of the puppet Manchurian army, which had entered eastern Hebei to fight until the Japanese surrendered on August 15th. Liu Depu, the commander of the Second Regiment, was a "Iron and Stone Troops" regimental commander, Wang Zhengguo, the chief of staff, was a colonel in the puppet Manchurian army and had served as the chief of the military affairs section of the puppet Manchurian military department; Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the Fourth Regiment, was also a regimental commander in the puppet Manchurian army, and Shi Zongzhong, the chief of staff, served as the translator and lieutenant of the Japanese military police advisor Kuroda in the puppet Manchurian army. These troops reorganized by the government have become political propaganda material against the Communist Party's military offensive against Changchun.

Soviet Army Withdraws, Communist Army Advances on Suburbs

After the withdrawal of the Soviet army, what is the topic in China here? The situation is now very clear: start fighting. As the Soviet army withdraws, the Communist army advances in the suburbs. On the 9th, thousands of Communist soldiers took a train south in Dehui and got off at Mishazi Station, ten kilometers north of Changchun. Later, the reporter asked the commander of the Communist army attacking Changchun about this matter, and his reply was this: "We came from Harbin, all on foot. When we arrived at Dehui, we saw empty carriages, and the brothers climbed on them, forcing the driver to drive. The Soviets don't get along well with us." On the 12th, Mengjiatun, Songjiawazi, and the vicinity of the airport were already in contact. In any case, as soon as Karnov left, the prelude to a great war was opened. When we left the train station, Zhuzhou's car drove away. It was too crowded for eight people to sit in a jeep, so we borrowed Zhang Datong's car. Beckett from the Associated Press, weighed the most among the eight, and his wine glass was never far from his hand. His appearance was similar to Goering. Because he was bored, while the other four were competing with Karnov and others on the platform, he went to the Soviet shopkeeper's station restaurant to drink vodka. With a shout, we eight people immediately squeezed into the car to go to the airport. Everyone was eager to see the war.

### Soft Protest: We Must See the War

Zhang Datong was timid and cautious, saying that there was a war going on and we couldn't go. We made a soft protest to him, saying that we were war correspondents, leaving him with no choice. But he believed that he had some responsibility for the safety of each person in his position as a government official, so he was quite worried, but he still sat in the car and went with us.

We didn't know the situation at all. The car sped along, and the people - Chinese and Japanese - were all in a daze. They stood in the streets, listening to the distant gunfire, not knowing what was going on. The car headed northwest, passing over the Xing'an Bridge. Below the bridge was the railroad. Here, 2,000 meters away from Datong Square in the city center, the people who wanted to cross the bridge could not pass and stopped at the Xing'an Avenue intersection east of the bridge. The gunfire became clearer.

After being questioned by the police guarding the bridge, the two cars continued forward. As a result, the gunfire naturally became louder and louder, and we could hear the layers of distance. At this time, there were no pedestrians on the road. After crossing the bridge for 1,000 meters, we arrived in front of the old Institute of Hygiene Technology and the Qianzao Hospital. We determined that the location of the gunfire was not far away, at most 500 meters. At this time, a military truck drove up in front and said that it was impossible to go any further. We immediately got out of the car and walked. Wheeler, Lippmann, Eberna, and Madsen ran the fastest, lined up and ran in the center of the road. Shenzhi and Beckett walked along the walls. We didn't know where the defensive positions were, we just walked along the road, seemingly searching forward, and it was quite possible to run to the attacking side.

### Bullets Whizzing as the Car Returns

Mr. Zhang Datong drove the car back again, seemingly urging us to return, which was truly terrible. We hurried back, telling the driver to drive back quickly, then turned around to run forward again. A stray bullet whizzed past, and everyone quickly crouched down, running across Xing'an Square.

From Xing'an Square to the city's central square, from northwest to southeast, was a straight Xing'an Avenue, about 4,500 meters long, with streetcar tracks running all the way to near the West Airport. This place was very desolate. Although it was within the city limits, it was not yet fully developed, mostly vacant land, with withered grass and a bleak atmosphere. Adding to this, many of the buildings were already dilapidated, creating a completely war-torn atmosphere, as if a three-month-long battle had already been fought here. An empty streetcar was parked on the north side of the square.

The six of us continued to run forward, and we found the garrison's stronghold, the "Northeast Red Cross," two hundred meters past the square. The garrison saw our group of uninvited guests, pulled open the barbed wire piled on the side door, and let us in. The garrison was inside the building, gathered on the rooftop on the third floor, firing north. We only saw the ground covered with spent cartridges.

### Indiscriminate Firing Without Identifying Targets

This was a company of the Fourth General Detachment. The company commander was flushed, and the soldiers all looked nervous. It was clear at a glance that they were all novices who had never fought before. We were all curious because we didn't see any movement on the other side.

"What are you shooting at?" Shen Zhi asked.

The company commander and his soldiers pointed and told everyone that people were hiding in one of the buildings in front. "We saw dozens of people run inside."

"So, do you know who these people are?"

"Not clear."

"Why don't you send someone to investigate?" There was no answer. They had not sent plainclothes scouts, had not sent reconnaissance troops, had not done any search work, had no intelligence, and did not even have a telephone. The whole company was isolated in this building, firing indiscriminately before even identifying the targets. So, when a real battle came, they would probably be silent.

It seemed that, as far as this stronghold was concerned, it had already put on a defensive posture. The city was vast, and the troops were already scattered. We looked around with binoculars. After about thirty minutes, no bullets came from the other side. The soldiers couldn't stand it anymore, and when their hands itched, they fired two shots, as if to say: We are here, we are a bit at a loss. The first time soldiers go to war is the most absurd.

In fact, we later learned that there were indeed a small number of communist troops. The airport was definitely impossible to pass, as fighting was ongoing. So we had to return. Beckett quickly went back to the train station to buy half a dozen bottles of vodka. Fortunately, these things saved him, otherwise, he would have had to hang himself in the days to come. Beckett and Lippmann, because they did not go forward, had a big discussion with us about the Chinese view of life.

That day, there was supposed to be a plane flying from Shenyang to land and then fly to Harbin, which had been arranged with the Soviets. This was also the first plane to fly to Harbin. But when it arrived in Changchun, there was fighting below, so it flew straight to Harbin. Two hours later, it flew back. At this time, the gunfire had temporarily stopped, and it circled and landed. Jin Enxin, the commander of the 14th Air Force District of Changchun, immediately jumped on the plane and flew to Shenyang. The previous day, when we asked him if he was going to Shenyang to study air transport, he said it was. As soon as the plane took off, the fighting started again below. The communist troops bombarded the airfield and air station with artillery, and after late at night, the airport telephone lines were cut.

Very good, the external communication lines were completely cut off. Zi Men and Zhu Zhou Zhuo, the four of us, were still in the Mantan Building, looking at each other and couldn't help laughing. The meaning was, "Just wait, there's no way to leave Changchun now, air transport? It's over too."

Tonight, the Ministry of Communications radio station in the Mantan Building moved to the Central Bank, unable to send out any news. The Mantan Building was quiet, and the sound of gunfire faintly carried over. Fighting was going on on the southwest, east, and three sides, truly lively. (To be continued)

### A Heartfelt Appeal

— Gu Yangping

Editor: After reading your newspaper's editorials "The Third Party Cannot Be Confused" and "Recognizing the Crux of the Political Stalemate," I understand that your newspaper is taking a very regrettable and anxious attitude because the public is not paying attention to serious national affairs and is not responding. It is indeed a very dangerous thing for the people to not pay attention to national affairs. But how can the poor Chinese people express that they are not confused? Their sorrow and pain cannot be imagined by anyone. If the political parties were willing to accept some of the people's appeals, the people would not be so silent. In any case, the struggle for political power, the struggle to avenge past grievances, is a struggle for private and partisan interests and does not put the people first. The Chinese people are deeply disgusted with political parties and politicians. Party strife has destroyed the fruits of victory, party strife has hindered national construction, party strife has undermined international standing, and party strife has created the unprecedented crises of famine, rural bankruptcy, economic crisis, educational stagnation, soaring prices, and rampant speculation in China today. The parties are wantonly poisoning the people and wantonly destroying the country. Seeing this land, freshly washed with the blood of countless Chinese men, so fragmented, our tears cannot help but flow!

If your newspaper is willing to sacrifice some valuable space, let us express some final appeals! We see very clearly why the Chinese Communist Party has such momentum. Because in the current era of the collapse of imperialism and the financial constraints of capitalist countries, Marxist thought seems to have become the highest political ideal. The Chinese Communist Party has used communism as a guise, attracting some intellectuals, cultural circles, self-proclaimed progressive youth, and poor people. At the same time, the Chinese Kuomintang is not living up to expectations, refusing to face the hardships of the people and refusing to make a firm decision to clean up the bureaucracy. When we hear that a cocktail party can support poor people for more than a year, everyone wants to become a communist! The Communist Party has thus gained great power. When the Communist Party gained power through speculation, it forgot about communism. First, it wanted to avenge its eighteen years of grievances with the Kuomintang; second, it wanted to satisfy its aspirations for political status. Under this intense emotion, they themselves forgot the original purpose of liberating the people, and they shattered the banner they had proclaimed. They oppose one-party dictatorship; but in their area, they do not allow the existence of other parties. They demand freedom of speech; but in their area, they do not allow dissenting opinions. They demand democracy; but they organize many cadres to control the actions of the people. They claim to liberate the people; but countless wailing people flee from the "liberated areas." They also say they respect the Founding Father; but they distort the theory of the Three Principles of the People. These cases of selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's head are too numerous to mention. Even more contemptible, they shamelessly claimed that more than 200 industrial facilities in the Northeast were intact, which really shocked us! The Soviet Union has already admitted in its reply to the US protest that the materials dismantled and transported were war spoils. Why does the Chinese Communist Party have to stubbornly conceal and cover up the loss of national rights and interests? This kind of flattering attitude makes us dare not imagine the intentions of the Communist Party. We strongly suspect that the Chinese Communist Party will become an organization like Shi Yirou Keng. The Soviet Communist Party only knows how to work hard for construction, but the Chinese Communist Party only knows how to work hard for destruction. The Soviet Communist Party strives for national strength, but the Chinese Communist Party aims to weaken national power and be a vassal. Why does the Chinese Communist Party have to fall to this point? The Communist Party has clearly exposed two dangerous mistakes; first, they think that abandoning the concept of nation in communism means becoming a vassal of others. Second, they think that the class equality of communism does not have the concept of rights and obligations. Regardless of right and wrong, they fulfill their obligations to the fullest extent, and the rights and interests they obtain should be the same as the obligations they fulfill to one-fifth of their ability. From this, we can prove that the Communist Party's use of force to seize territory is meaningless and has no different intentions from Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, the wandering bandits of the late Ming Dynasty! We earnestly appeal, hoping that the Chinese Communist Party, for the sake of the country and the people, and for the sake of the future and status of their own party, should immediately stop the actions of looting and destruction. If the Chinese Communist Party can take good care of the country and show compassion for the people, they will definitely achieve their political aspirations. Why do they only believe in force and not trust the great power of the people?

From overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, completing the Northern Expedition, to winning the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Kuomintang has indeed done its best and made the greatest contribution to saving the country and the nation. Now they are shouldering the heavy responsibility of national construction again. They are fulfilling their responsibilities to the country, and we cannot bear to overthrow them for no reason. However, the Kuomintang's political stubbornness, numbness, and sluggishness in recent years have indeed caused dissatisfaction among many people. Why not thoroughly clean up the bureaucracy? Why not sacrifice the special enjoyment and power of the bureaucrats and dignitaries? Why not face the hardships of the people? Why not stabilize the lives of public school teachers? Why not give out-of-school youth the opportunity and convenience to receive education? Why not really work hard to curb prices? Why only focus on the decoration of cities and ignore the collapse of rural areas? Why does a public affair have to "wait for instructions and then follow them," making a big detour and showing off, instead of striving for improvement in administrative efficiency? In this way, not only has it created an excuse for the Communist Party to attack, but the people are also unbearably anxious. We earnestly appeal, hoping that the Kuomintang will immediately save itself and the country and use a frank and refreshing new spirit to thoroughly improve politics. Our position is to absolutely support the national policy of nationalizing the army, maintaining sovereignty, and unifying government orders, but we also sympathize with the political ideals of the Communist Party and oppose one-party dictatorship. We do not hope that any party will only use the banner of "democracy" to whet our appetites. We only hope that everyone can accept our heartfelt appeal. Whoever is willing to accept our appeal is the truly democratic party! Gu Yangping, May 16.

Comic Strip "Sanmao Joins the Army" (8) by Zhang Leping

### The Two Heroes of the Northeast Corner

— Special Translation by the Editorial Office of This Newspaper

A correspondent for the Los Angeles Times recently sent a telegram from Shenyang saying that the leaders of both the Nationalist and Communist parties here have privately stated that decisive military action is inevitable before peace can be achieved in the Northeast. If this statement is true, then the future battle for Changchun will be a wonderful performance between China's two finest military men. Their achievements are comparable to those of the two American heroes, Generals Grant and Lee.

Both Excellent Military Men Were Students of the Whampoa Military Academy

These two excellent military men are General Du Yuming, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army in the Northeast, and General Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army. One commands the Nationalist Army in various battles from the headquarters in Shenyang, and the other commands the Communist combat troops from a mobile headquarters. Both graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy, Du in 1924 and Lin a year later.

General Du Yuming, a Genius of Mechanized Warfare

Du Yuming was born in Shanxi Province in 1903. After enlisting, he was promoted from platoon leader to general for his meritorious service in combat and was praised as a genius of mechanized warfare in China. In 1939, Du organized the 200th Division of the Chinese Army's First Mechanized Unit. In 1942, as commander of the Fifth and Sixth Armies, he entered Burma with General Stilwell, and after Japan surrendered, he withdrew from Burma with Stilwell.

After returning to China, Du re-established the Chinese mechanized units that had defeated the Japanese army in Burma and South China. He has a military demeanor, a handsome appearance, and looks like he is not yet forty-three years old. Du is frank and amiable, and although he is busy planning and commanding military affairs, he never refuses to meet visiting guests.

If They Disobey Orders, the Government Will Surely Defeat the Communist Army

Du spoke frankly about the importance of the government's mission in the Northeast. He once told reporters: "If there is a second army in a country that is detrimental to that country, then that country will never be peaceful. Therefore, either the Communist Party must obey the orders of the government, or the government must defeat the Communist army."

Du said that the biggest obstacle to peace in China is the Communist Party's failure to abide by the agreement signed by Zhou Enlai and Marshall on January 25, which stipulated that the Communist army should be incorporated into the newly编的国民军内的。

Lin Biao Engaged in Long-Term Guerrilla Warfare in Southern Jiangxi

Lin Biao is the Communist Party's most outstanding tactician, and he can be said to be a worthy opponent to the sophisticated and capable Du Yuming. Lin is short and stout, with a gentle manner and a quiet demeanor, and looks very much like a university professor. However, he has a reputation as a strategist and commander, and even government publications praise his achievements.

Lin Biao was born in Huang'an, Hubei Province, in 1907. After graduating from middle school, he entered the Guangdong Whampoa Military Academy in 1924 and graduated in 1925. After the split between the Nationalists and the Communists in 1927, he joined the Communist army. From 1927 to 1928, he followed Mao Zedong in guerrilla warfare in the mountains of southern Jiangxi, fighting until the entire guerrilla force was reduced to less than one hundred people.

Yan'an "Rest and Recuperation" Was a Deliberate Plan for the Northeast War

Lin first showed his outstanding talents when he made the Long March to Jinggang Mountain in 1928. The following year, he was appointed commander of the Fourth Red Army, and in 1932 he was promoted to commander of the First Red Army Group. At that time, he was only twenty-five years old. In 1937, he served as commander of the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army. At that time, the Communist Party had united with the Nationalist Army to jointly resist Japan. He defeated a brigade of the Japanese army in northern Shanxi, which made him famous for a time. He later fought many more victories.

According to the Communist Party, Lin lived in Yan'an throughout the second half of the Sino-Japanese War for rest and recuperation. But now it seems that he had been burying himself in planning for the Northeast War for many years, because when he came to the Northeast last August, he brought a group of outstanding staff officers from the Communist Party, many of whom were psychology experts. The Communist Party attaches great importance to operational psychology, and they believe that the influence of the people in the war zone is just as important as the deployment of the army.

The future battle for Changchun is a crucial key to gaining strategic control of the entire Northeast. The main question is whether Du Yuming's American-equipped New First Army, supported by the air force, can overwhelm Lin Biao's mixed army, which emphasizes mental training.

### A Short Stay in Luodong

— Special Correspondent Mu Yun, Luodong, Taiwan, 11th Aviation News

In Hedong Suao, the reporter spent three full days inspecting the local customs and folk customs, and visited the cement factory taken over by the Industrial and Mining Office and the local unique carbonated water factory. On the 10th, we took the 11:18 train again and arrived in Luodong in 30 minutes.

Luodong is a town between Yilan and Suao. The total population of the area is about 40,000, with five townships. Because it is a distribution market for Taitung materials, it is far more prosperous than Suao. In the past, the Japanese had three hotels, and only two remained after the Retrocession. We stayed at the Xinhua Hotel, which was taken over by people from Yangzhong County in the mainland.

Forest Railway. There is a railway station from Luodong to Tuchang, which is called the "Forest Railway," because it takes two hours to walk from Tuchang to the base camp of Hinoki forest - Taipingshan. The place is 58.6 kilometers away from Luodong, the foothills are low tropical forests, while the Nanhu Mountain at an altitude of 3,797 meters has cold temperate forests. The area of ​​this forest is 63.177 hectares, and the amount of stored needle-leaved trees is 6,810.848, broad-leaved trees are 13,053.695, a total of 19,864.543 cubic meters, and its storage capacity may exceed Alishan. The current logging volume in Luodong district is about 80,000 stones of cypress wood (each stone is 4,500 catties) and 120,000 stones of miscellaneous wood per year. If the current price of cypress wood products is calculated at 540 yuan per stone, this number is quite amazing. (In the past, cypress wood - logs were priced at 40 yuan per stone, and now they have risen to 260 yuan. Miscellaneous wood products used to be priced at 80 yuan per stone, and now they have risen to 540 yuan.) Because a part of the forest railway was destroyed by floods and has not been repaired until now, and the price of gasoline is high and there is a shortage of goods, transportation is very difficult, so to expand the forest production capacity, the restoration of the transportation line can no longer be delayed. A large amount of wood is piled up along the railway line here. There are more than a dozen fairly large sawmills, which are being worked in a state of semi-idleness under the takeover of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Fanggan Factory was taken over, and some are operating personal businesses under the guise of official names. This phenomenon of ebb is making people very pessimistic about the future of the forest industry.

Aboriginal Aversion. There are more than 2,000 Gaoshan ethnic groups on Taiping Mountain, most of which are semi-civilized aborigines. Thirty years ago, the Japanese spent eight or nine years and used all kinds of methods to "conquer" them. After the Retrocession, there was a period when the National Army recruited volunteers, and more than 300 Gaoshan ethnic groups came, but because of some trivial matters, they all returned to the mountains. It is difficult to say whether anyone is supporting this aversion behind the scenes, but it is very believable that if they are oppressed by force when they are averse, at least it is impossible at present. It is difficult to grasp how much cypress branch ammunition is stored in the deep mountains. Therefore, when the reporter wanted to go to Taiping Mountain, local friends tried their best to stop my attempt. The beautiful scenery of this ancient forest can only be left for later.

Rice Area Famine. Luodong is a rice-producing area. In the plains for dozens of miles, two crops of rice are planted every year. The reporter passed by various places, all of which were rice fields. Now it is almost the ripening period, and at most there is one month before it can be harvested.

The whole province is now experiencing a food shortage. In Suao, it goes without saying that people are using sweet potatoes as the main food. However, in the producing area of ​​Luodong, the market price is also 500 yuan per stone (23 catties in Shanghai), and cries of hunger are heard everywhere. This is the most noteworthy fact. The参议会员提出的台湾闹米荒, and上海却有台米可买, 也 没 得到 具体的 答复. Historically, the rice produced here, if it is a bumper year, is enough to meet the consumption of the province for three years. Now the rice-producing area cannot be self-sufficient, either the rice-producing area is suffering.

The power of hooligans and gangsters is the toxin that plagues Luodong's construction and security. It is extremely rampant, and residents are terrified. They have hundreds of disciples, carry sharp weapons, and act unreasonably, causing trouble everywhere. They collude with the local volunteer police team, forcibly occupy Japanese-owned houses, and arbitrarily oppress civilians. The district office and the police station are all worried about this. Especially the volunteer police team, which is manipulated behind the scenes by local thugs. There used to be more than 200 people, but after being disarmed by the National Army, there are only 70 or 80 people left to assist in maintaining local security, but their "maintenance" is not valued.

The district office is currently detaining more than a dozen bandits, three of whom have committed more than ten bloody cases. The district office has temporarily set up an electric wire outside the detention facility because they are afraid of prison break. The Taipei County Police Department has repeatedly urged them to interrogate them, but the district office does not dare to send them out with peace of mind, because they believe that after being escorted to the military court, they may be released on bail or have their sentences reduced. If this is done, the parties involved and the district office will suffer. And now the local people all hope that they will be executed on the spot. This kind of distrust of superiors is also a special phenomenon among the special phenomena in Taiwan province!

Movies and Drama

### The Directing Method of "Promotion Chart"

— Tao Neng

The author of "Promotion Chart" deeply grasped reality and exaggeratedly depicted it using artistic techniques, making the theme of the play very obvious and its meaning quite profound.

The director handled this play with a "profound yet simple" method, presenting the play's content to the audience bit by bit, without any omissions.

When the curtain was raised, we saw a completely symmetrical scene: the door in the center of the back wall was pushed open from the middle, dividing towards both sides. A double sofa was placed at each stage left and right. An eight-immortal table was in the center of the stage, with a grand master's chair leaning against each side of the table. The lights shone from both sides, and the shadows of the tables and chairs fell towards both sides.

After that, the principle of the scene remained the same, but the form changed. The back wall was a "Taiping Tongbao" coin, and the square frame in the coin became the door in the center. The left wall was a huge silver chest, and the door of the silver chest replaced the door leading to the inner room. A large lantern with the word "Bribe" written on it hung on the right wall. The surrounding area of the stage opening was the edge of a banknote, and the word "Ten" could be seen on the edge of the banknote. The sofas on the left and right stage entrances were still present. After that, each scene change only involved the props in the center of the stage.

The director also used a symmetrical method for the actors' entrance. The most obvious scene was when they received the governor back. The actors entered in pairs from the back wall, standing on the left and right, and then continued to enter in this way. The governor sat alone in the chair in the center, and everyone else stood on either side.

Another scene: The governor and the magistrate got married, and the two pairs of newlyweds stood on small round platforms on the left and right, reading congratulatory speeches.

The above two scenes are examples of static symmetry. The director also used dynamic symmetry to handle the actors' movements on stage. For example: The governor is coming soon. The five bureau chiefs stood in a row, listening to the secretary-general's instructions. When the police reported that the governor was forty li away from the city, the five bureau chiefs turned around together and picked up the ten thousand umbrellas. When the police reported for the second time that the governor was only thirty li away from the city, the five bureau chiefs were so anxious that they had nowhere to go. They turned the umbrellas in their hands, moving back and forth, crossing each other one by one. This immediately created a mechanically chaotic stage, expressing the panic and anxiety of this group of bureau chiefs.

The director's handling of the actors' actions was also mostly exaggerated. For example, after the police chief presented his younger sister to the magistrate, he went out saluting all the way, ecstatic.

The twisting of Miss Ma's body and the swinging of her arms as she entered and exited.

The queue when opening the silver chest, the falling of a string of people.

The governor, shirtless and wearing a red bib, sat in the center of the grand master's chair, with one leg raised and resting on the chair, drinking tea with a small teapot in one hand.

The actors' speeches were also exaggerated. For example, when the attendants received gold bars from the magistrate and the bureau chiefs, they shouted in the tone of a waiter in a restaurant noodle shop: "Received two gold bars..."

In addition, the costumes of the characters in the play were all exaggerated: the shoulder pads were as high as camel humps, and the badges were as big as plates. In particular, the director of finance wore ingots on his head, banknotes on his body, and pockets full of exorbitant taxes on his shoulders.

The performance of this play was consistently exaggerated, but there was not a single place where we could see that it was uncoordinated. Even the makeup was like that. This kind of performance was the first time I saw it, but I think its performance was successful! It is the success of the director! It is the success of all the actors and backstage staff! It is also the success of the Shanghai Drama Society.

### Introducing the New Film "House of Loyalty and Righteousness" from China Electric Factory No. 2

— Guan Yu

"House of Loyalty and Righteousness," currently being filmed by China Electric Factory No. 2, is a narrative film about the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, in which the people firmly believe they can achieve final victory. The content describes the protagonist Hua Gengzhai's family's loyalty and self-sacrifice for the country, with three generations of grandparents and grandchildren enduring hardships and demonstrating unwavering loyalty.

This film is written and directed by Wu Yonggang, and the important actors include: Liu Qiong, Qin Yi (Qin Yi was known as one of the four famous actresses in Chongqing's drama circles. Because of her skilled acting and perfect stage appearance, she has a considerable number of audiences.), Fang Bo, Zheng Hui, etc. The set design is by Li Enjie. All are top-notch figures from Chongqing and Shanghai.

The plot is set in Shanghai under enemy and puppet control. Therefore, there are factual records of various atrocities during the enemy and puppet period. For example, the inhumane torture instruments in the No. 76 Devil's Den; such as: tying two big thumbs and hanging them on the beam; pouring cold water into the nose, using electric chairs, etc.

Rice cannot be bought in rice shops, and citizens go to the countryside to buy rice and carry it back. When passing through the blockade line, they are confiscated, extorted, and shot by the enemy.

People milling rice line up before dawn. When the rice shops open to sell rice, scalpers collude with puppet police to disperse the queues, line up at the front themselves, buy the rice and then resell it. The real ordinary people waiting for rice to eat cannot buy rice.

The Japanese arbitrarily rob people's belongings. Traitors arbitrarily squeeze good people. The actions of patriotic workers. The Japanese military police blockade areas, causing people in the blocked areas without stored rice to starve to death. Our planes bombed the enemy's airfield, and underground workers directed the bombing targets and fought with enemy soldiers.

These are all familiar to the citizens of Shanghai, and also the suffering they have personally experienced in the past eight years. Now that it has been made into a film by the Central Film Studio No. 2 Factory, it is worth our serious introduction and recommendation!

This film is being rushed to completion by the screenwriter and director Wu Yonggang day and night and is already half completed and is expected to be fully successful next month. Soon it will meet the Shanghai audience, making the first great contribution to the film industry after the victory and repatriation!

### Mei Lanfang Performs Commercial Plays Again

— Ji Zhifeng

The three characters Mei Lanfang have already become a representative type of ancient Oriental beauty in most people's minds, and not just the name of an artist. I believe that many real ancient beauties may not be as beautiful as he performs on stage, and when he went to perform in various countries around the world before, artists from various countries unanimously acknowledged that his entire body movement conformed to the latest principles of aesthetics. Although they don't understand the singing skills of old dramas, when he performed in the United States, one day after he finished singing, the audience was greatly moved and applauded non-stop, and he had to come out and thank them, opening the curtain more than twenty times, breaking the world singing record. Can you say this is accidental?

Mr. Mei has suffered too much loss in the past eight years because he was unwilling to perform under the rule of the enemy puppets, because his burden is quite heavy - in addition to providing for three sons and one daughter to study, he also has many relatives and friends who also need his continuous help. Although he is very frugal and has no bad habits, this expenditure has been quite considerable during wartime when prices have soared. But where does this expenditure come from? Mr. Mei, being an artist, will not make a few wooden handguns to rob people, nor will he hoard goods for speculation and make money from national crises. He can only gradually sell his real estate, industry, calligraphy and paintings, and antiques. Now that victory has arrived, his little savings from singing plays for half his life are also gone. Even if we don't talk about promoting national essence or promoting art, just to solve personal economic problems, and for an old man over fifty years old to still put on makeup and perform, it is already very worthy of our sympathy. However, recently when he performed a commercial play at the Nanjing Theater, some people suspected that he was going to make a fortune. Of course, the highest ticket price is 12,000 yuan and the lowest is 3,000 yuan, averaging 11 to 12 million yuan per day, which seems to be quite considerable. But if we calculate carefully, the entertainment tax alone has removed half of it, and the theater rent is 2 million yuan per performance. Then, after removing the actors' salaries and the travel expenses of the actors invited from Beiping, as well as publicity expenses, how much is left? I think any reader can figure it out. With such a small income, it is really impossible to compensate for one ten thousandth of the loss he has suffered in the past eight years. Where can we talk about making a fortune? We only hope that he is healthy and can perform a few more times. In addition to being a pioneer in reforming dramas, it may be slightly beneficial to the old age of this generation of artists, so that they will not need others to provide relief in their old age like many artists.

### Cured Third-Stage Lung Disease Patients Print and Send National Lung Disease Special Medicine Formula

(Note) After receiving the special and wonderful formula for treating lung disease sent by Zhang Xixian, the director of the Fengxiang County Police Bureau in Shaanxi Province, we immediately sent it to Mr. Chen Cunren, a consultant and Chinese medicine practitioner in this column, for careful study. Now, after Mr. Chen added annotations, he believes that this formula is indeed valuable, and it is specially published for patients to try. As for its effectiveness, we will still ask readers to provide practical experiment reports in the future. This is actually creating a new record in Chinese medicine. (Editor)

The Only Wonderful Formula for Treating Tuberculosis

In the Western hospitals in Henan, this Chinese formula is used to treat tuberculosis, saving countless people. It was passed on to Xi'an, and also saved many people. There were reports published in the Zheng Bao on January 28th and February 22nd introducing it (Xi'an's famous Western doctor Wang Ziwei also proved the miraculous effect of this formula, and several of his friends were cured). Even third-stage lung disease can be brought back from the dead. It is truly a wonderful formula.

Mulberry Bark, Asparagus, Raw Rehmannia Root, Cooked Rehmannia Root, Donkey-Hide Gelatin, Ophiopogon Root, Safflower, Apricot Kernel, Fritillaria Bulb, Anemarrhena, Licorice Root, White Peony Root, Angelica Root.

A total of thirteen flavors, one mace each. Two mace each for those who cough up blood or are seriously ill. Use three eggs, cook them with the medicine, peel off the eggshells, use a wooden pestle to prick dozens of holes in the eggs, then put them back in the medicine and cook well. Eat the eggs first, then eat the medicine, on an empty stomach, both morning and evening are fine.

Attached Experience Gained

(1) Choose small, fresh eggs. Use a larger medicine pot with a lid. Put more water in it, cook it for a longer time, and cook it tightly covered. (2) At the beginning, you can take two mace each, one dose per day, and only eat the first decoction. Until the disease is slightly better, you can also take it every other day. (3) There are no restrictions on the time of taking the medicine. Both men and women, old and young, can take it. However, it is advisable to have a pure heart and few desires, and to cultivate well. (4) Take as much as needed until the disease is cured (or dozens of doses or hundreds of doses are fine). This is a kingly holy medicine that nourishes the lungs, stops coughing, resolves phlegm, nourishes the spleen, strengthens the stomach, removes filth and generates new ones. You can eat more of it. Even long-term cough can be cured. (5) Some people cough and spit more after eating ninety doses. Do not be afraid. This is a phenomenon of removing filth and generating new ones. Continue to take it, and the disease will gradually be cured. However, some people do not have this phenomenon. (6) Please print and copy more and give it to others. The merit is immeasurable, and it will benefit your descendants for generations.

[Dr. Chen Cunren's Note] Your office sent this formula and asked me to study it. After checking about twenty relevant medical books, I have not found this same formula. It should be a verified formula circulating among modern people. Its organization is a mixture of three old formulas: "Xie Bai San, Donkey-Hide Gelatin Decoction, and Ophiopogon Root Decoction." It is indeed a good Chinese medicine formula for treating the lungs. Its medicinal properties are nourishing, tonifying the lungs, increasing fluids, clearing heat, and nourishing blood. It is really beneficial and harmless for tuberculosis patients to take this formula regularly! According to my observation, this formula is generally more effective than cod liver oil calcium preparations in terms of nutritional treatment value for chronic tuberculosis. It is indeed possible to cure tuberculosis! However, chronic tuberculosis, its extent has gone beyond the lungs, such as combined pharyngeal paralysis (i.e. laryngeal tuberculosis), hemorrhoidal fistula (glandular tuberculosis), diarrhea (intestinal tuberculosis), etc., this formula is obviously ineffective. Also, acute tuberculosis, such as 100-day tuberculosis (i.e. miliary tuberculosis), this formula is also ineffective. Because this formula only has the effect of chronic nourishment, those who also have tidal fever and bone steaming, its progression is faster, then this formula is useless.

To the Editor: Tuberculosis is a common enemy of mankind in the world, especially a great disaster for the poor people of China. Patients have no special medicine to treat it, and can only listen to nature and wait to die. Therefore, the mortality rate of tuberculosis is increasing day by day, and the harm is so great that everyone knows it. After the end of the First World War, the number of people who died from this disease has doubled, which is truly frightening. Now, the Second World War has just ended. After the great soldiers, there will inevitably be epidemics. Among the epidemics, tuberculosis is the worst. The people's lives are more difficult, and the materials are more scarce. They cannot get enough nutrition to resist the invasion of diseases, and they spread from person to person until they cannot be contained. Therefore, countries around the world, in view of the terrible tuberculosis death rate of the First World War, have formed tuberculosis prevention committees, but since there is no special medicine to provide relief, it is difficult to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Fortunately, there is a Chinese herbal medicine miracle formula handed down in the world, which has saved countless people in the provinces of Henan and Shaanxi. It is truly the only savior for patients, and can also be the greatest help for tuberculosis prevention committees and Chinese and Western doctors. How dare you not make it public to the world to benefit the public? I hope that you gentlemen will have great compassion and sympathy, and publish it in a special column to spread the word, so that virtue will be bestowed on the masses and the merit will be immeasurable. Please do not treat it as unrelated news, or that other newspapers have already published it, and I can not publish it, and ignore it.

I have suffered from tuberculosis for four years, sometimes better and sometimes worse. I have recuperated in the quiet mountains and forests several times. I have been treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors. I have also eaten and injected precious medicines and injections. I have exhausted all my family property, and I can barely breathe, but the disease has not really been cured. Last winter, the disease broke out again, coughing up blood like a waterfall. The dangerous situation was even worse than before. The doctors were helpless, and the hospital did not accept me. Later, a friend told me about this formula. I took more than 20 doses in a row, and then I walked as usual. After more than 50 doses, I recovered better than before. Now I am the director of the Fengxiang Police Bureau. Wang Jun Zuyang also suffered from this disease and reached the third stage. Last March, he went to the Provincial Hospital for an X-ray, and the right lung tissue was completely destroyed. The disease was severe and he was on the verge of death. After taking this medicine, after several months, the disease has been cured. After examination, it has been completely restored. We are deeply grateful for our past suffering, so we sincerely broadcast this formula to the world to help the world. Now more than 200 people have been cured in Xi'an, and the price of the medicine is very cheap. Each flavor is two mace per dose, which is only more than 300 yuan, which is especially easy for poor people to take. How lucky!

Zhang Xixian, a third-stage lung disease cured patient, printed and sent it to the director of the Fengxiang County Police Bureau in Shaanxi Province. Wang Zuyang, a third-stage lung disease cured patient, No. 9 Xuanfeng Bridge, Xi'an, and Wu Shaowen's nephew, No. 11 Daxiaozi Temple Street, Xi'an.
