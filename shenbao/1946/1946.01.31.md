He has issued a personal order to the Executive Yuan and relevant authorities to expedite the completion of the following three tasks: (1) To exert the utmost effort to restore railway transportation, and to strengthen highway transportation and shipping.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] After arriving in Nanjing, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun today met with more than ten people, including Chen Liudong, Special Commissioner for Finance and Banking, Li Jialong, Manager of the Central Bank, and Jiang Shuge, Director of the Taxation Bureau. He forcefully refuted the widespread rumors that the government would issue Sun Yat-sen banknotes, deeming it absurd. (Please refer to the Business News on page five.) It is reported that Minister Yu's trip will lead to important decisions regarding the reform of taxation, private operation of salt, and the exchange of counterfeit currency. Furthermore, Mr. Yu, after meeting with reporters from this newspaper, stated that foreign exchange, after being approved, would be announced soon. When asked whether the official gold price would be changed immediately, he replied that this had not yet been discussed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Concrete measures for the nationwide opening of salt sales to private operation have been decided by relevant authorities and will be announced after the Spring Festival. Additionally, the Ministry of Communications has made important decisions regarding opening up highways and encouraging private operation, with particular emphasis on commercial transportation on the northwest and southwest routes.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] The deadline for exchanging counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes is approaching, and the number of counterfeit notes circulating in various regions remains high. Furthermore, banks in various regions have not yet fully resumed operations, and exchange agencies are not widely distributed, making it difficult for people to apply for exchanges. Considering the rights and interests of the people and to facilitate their exchange, the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Central Bank to increase the number of entrusted exchange banks and firms as much as possible within a feasible scope, and has notified each entrusted exchange bank and firm to appropriately relax restrictions on the number of people and the amount of money to be exchanged, in order to make it more widespread. It has also been stipulated that in cases where there are no designated responsible exchange banks or firms, or where there are exchange banks or firms but the number is too small to meet the needs, the county chamber of commerce may organize an exchange committee to be responsible for the exchange in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Central Bank. The above measures have been telegraphed to the relevant provincial governments, instructing the county governments to comply.

### The Executive Headquarters Orders Yi Feng's Team to Withdraw, Three Hundred Civil Engineers Will Come to China to Assist in Road Repair

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] The Executive Headquarters has ordered the Chifeng Security Team to withdraw from the city, making Chifeng a neutral and peaceful city. The Executive Headquarters decided on the 30th to send additional personnel to promote this. It is understood that this order is based on the agreement that no troops from either side may enter Yi Feng after midnight on the 20th. The local security team is a unit under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, so it was ordered to withdraw.

[United Press, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] It is reported that the Kuomintang and Communist forces in Xuzhou reached an agreement on the 28th of this month to cease conflict. News from the Northeast states that three regiments of the Eighth Route Army have entered Chifeng, but this has not yet been confirmed. According to a telephone report received by the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters from Colonel Dutilrode, the U.S. representative, Chifeng is currently guarded by a security team, and both the Kuomintang and Communist forces are outside the city. Although there have been minor conflicts among the local troops, the situation has not escalated.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th Dispatch] A press conference for foreign journalists was held at 3:00 PM today, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen, Vice Minister Liu Cuo, and Counselor Zhang Pingqun.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] According to a responsible official of the Ministry of Communications here, 500 kilometers of railways in North China have been destroyed in the past four months, and it will take at least three months to fully repair them. The five major railway lines in North China, namely the Pinghan, Pingsui, Jiaoji, Longhai, and Jinpu railways, have all been damaged. The sleepers are completely gone. The rails are relatively intact because they are too heavy to move easily. It is said that the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Pinghan and Jinpu railways is still in good condition, but most of the small bridges have been severely damaged. At present, China has requested the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to supply railway materials. Before the arrival of the materials, wooden bridges will be built to temporarily replace the iron bridges for temporary use. The Chinese railway authorities have notified the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration of the materials needed to repair the railways. Currently, China cannot manufacture locomotives, sleepers, and rails, so foreign assistance is urgently needed. According to reliable sources here today, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is currently sending 300 civil engineers to China to assist in the restoration of railway work.

### The Preparatory Meeting for the National Assembly Will Be Held in Nanjing, Zhou Enlai Arrived in Chongqing Yesterday from Shaanxi

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 30th Dispatch] The Yunnan Public Association of the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association recently received a telegram from the Chongqing General Association stating that the National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of this year, and it has been decided to invite all representatives to convene a preparatory meeting in Nanjing on April 4th to discuss everything. Representatives from various provinces and cities should arrive in the capital before April 3rd. After receiving this telegram, the Yunnan branch has notified the National Assembly representatives in Yunnan to prepare to attend the meeting on schedule. Furthermore, Su Ting, a member of the Political Consultative Conference's Military Inspection Group and a Senator, flew from Chongqing to Kunming on the 25th for a visit. According to him, he hopes that the Military Inspection Group will not set out because "we are all one family, why bother rehashing old accounts?" However, facts have proven that the group still needs to start work immediately, so it is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on February 1st to prepare for departure.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th Dispatch] The National Assembly Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference held a meeting on the afternoon of the 30th but failed to reach an agreement.

### Soviet Troops Are Withdrawing from the Northeast, The Substantive Takeover by Provincial and Municipal Governments Awaits Development

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] Sources with good information provided our reporter with news that awaits verification, namely that Soviet troops in China may take parallel action with U.S. troops in China. The deadline for the Soviet troops to withdraw completely from the Northeast on March 1st (or at the latest February 3rd) is approaching rapidly, and as of now, except for the Soviet troops in Chifeng who withdrew on the 23rd, there is no sign of the Soviet troops in the Northeast withdrawing on schedule. It is understood that the Soviet army originally notified the Chinese authorities that Chifeng, Chengde, and Duolun would withdraw by the 20th, and the railway along the Changchun line would begin to withdraw on the 15th, withdrawing completely by February 1st. According to the Soviet side, the reason for the delay in the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in the Northeast is due to a lack of train fuel. Regarding Changchun and Shenyang, it is not that the National Army cannot take over, but because the National Army's strength is still weak, so the Soviets are still responsible. Madam Chiang's trip to the Northeast was hasty, with the official explanation being that the four-day round trip was a planned schedule, but some also said that it was due to the climate in Changchun being too cold. Shen Yi is still in Changchun, and after most of the municipal personnel arrive, he will go to Dalian. An Dong's Chairman Gao Xibing may spend the old year in the former capital. Director Xiong Shihui came to Beiping because he had been in the front for too long and returned to Beiping to connect with the rear, and will return to Jinzhou soon.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] The situation in the nine northeastern provinces under the snow and wind of early February, which has been awaited for a long time by Chinese and foreigners alike, will be no different from before this period. Although the Soviet side is about to withdraw its troops, the difficulties with fuel and vehicles will allow them enough time to take a few more looks at the changes in the overall situation in China. Although the National Government has already had seven or eight provincial chairmen and mayors take office, the takeover is still substantively stuck at the symbolic stage. Mayor Zhi Wenqi of Shenyang is still a traveler in the Taihe Hotel, and many chairmen, who are not much different from him, probably haven't kicked out the "first three kicks" yet. The climate in the Northeast is too cold. Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming both fell ill one after another because they couldn't stand it. Even the old youth Zhang Jia'ao, who has been busy all his life, has had headaches in Changchun every day. Sun Jinqi, who developed the Yumen oil field in the northwest winds and sands, just returned from Changchun today. He seems to have also been infected with the disease. He looks dispirited and says that he is not prepared to go to the Northeast. His job is to be the commissioner responsible for taking over the industrial and mining industries in the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] The situation in the Northeast is difficult to clarify in the short term. The Northeast Headquarters will still temporarily move to Jinzhou, a remote corner. After returning to Beiping, Director Xiong has begun to prepare for this matter and will send one responsible person from each of the eight major departments to make arrangements within the next few days.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 30th Dispatch] It was learned today from a senior official of the Northeast Headquarters that the work of withdrawing Soviet troops from the various garrison areas in the Northeast is in full swing, but due to poor weather conditions and lack of transportation and fuel, the takeover work of the National Army has been affected. Therefore, the withdrawal of Soviet troops may not be completed according to the planned schedule.

### Eight Students of the Nanjing Provisional University Released on Bail After Trial

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Thirtieth] In the case of the students of the Nanjing Provisional University's preparatory class injuring the head of the class, Wang Shulin, fourteen leading students, and the local court's procuratorate detained and investigated Bai Qing and eight others. They were prosecuted for interfering with association affairs and obstructing freedom. The criminal court of the court held a public investigation hearing at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The judge questioned each defendant one by one, and the defendants' lawyers requested that each defendant be released on bail and the detention be stopped. After the judge retired from the court, he ruled in writing that each defendant was granted bail. At that time, thousands of students from Nanjing and the students from Shanghai's Provisional University in Nanjing gathered in the court square to wait for news of the trial, and the order was quite good.

### Jiangsu Clarifies Officialdom, Will Replace More Than Ten County Magistrates

It is reported that at least ten county magistrates in Jiangnan and Jiangbei will be replaced.

### Harriman Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing, Returns to the United States via Tokyo This Morning, Wedemeyer Answers Reporters' Questions

[Central News Agency, This City News] U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, accompanied by his daughter, Ganalian, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon (the 30th) and is scheduled to fly to Japan this morning and return to the United States. General Wedemeyer did not announce the reason for General Harriman's return to the United States this time when he received reporters.

Also, General Eichelberger, Commander of the Eighth U.S. Army in Japan, his Chief of Staff, Major General Churchill, and Major General Keissling, Chief of the Engineering Division of General MacArthur's Headquarters, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 30th) at noon and will go to Tokyo with Ambassador Harriman this morning (the 31st).

[This Newspaper News] Yesterday morning, General Wedemeyer received local reporters at the Construction Building and spoke freely for an hour, answering questions from the reporters:

(1) Regarding the transfer or sale of U.S. ships to China, the Chinese and American governments are negotiating. There are currently no ships being transferred or sold. However, during the transition period, Mr. Wedemeyer is authorized to dispose of the six Liberty ships under his jurisdiction. The use of these six ships will follow the will of Generalissimo Chiang, to transport troops and evacuate Japanese residents.

(2) The ceasefire order is progressing smoothly. Although there are sporadic battles, the overall situation is good. Mr. Wedemeyer had not heard about the rumored train from Tianjin to Qinhuangdao being robbed and shot at near Tangshan.

(3) The content of the conversation between Special Envoy Marshall and Mr. Wedemeyer when he came to Shanghai was mainly how to enable the U.S. military under Mr. Wedemeyer's command to assist the Executive Headquarters in its work, especially in transportation and radio communications. A radio station has now been established in Beiping to command and connect small teams sent to various places. In addition, the demobilization of the U.S. military in the China Theater was also mentioned. Those with sufficient points should be sent back to their country, while some should remain to perform their tasks. Mr. Wedemeyer denied advising Marshal Marshall not to go to Xuzhou.

(4) The U.S. military has never directly transported the New Sixth Army to the Northeast, but only transported the National Army to Qinhuangdao and Huludao by water. There were no American personnel or transportation equipment involved in going deeper. The U.S. military has never airlifted the National Army to the Northeast. Regarding the request of U.S. reporters to go to the Northeast for interviews, he has telegraphed Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to request this, but there has been no response.

(5) Regarding the evacuation of Japanese residents, it has been intensified since President Truman announced his policy last year. Only 30,000 people were evacuated in December last year, but currently 300,000 people have been evacuated (including those to Taiwan).

(6) MacArthur ordered that the U.S. military should assist the Chinese government in accepting the surrender before the Chinese troops arrive and then hand over the Japanese prisoners and weapons to the Chinese government. As for the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and residents, the U.S. military's task is only to assist and supervise. The actual work is the responsibility of China.

Because the traffic situation in Shanghai is quite chaotic, Mr. Wedemeyer plans to visit Mayor Qian to discuss remedial measures. The reporters present offered many suggestions, which Mr. Wedemeyer accepted.

### Madame Chiang's Visit to Changchun

— (Special Dispatch from Our Changchun Correspondent)

Changchun is now in the depths of winter, but the end of winter will bring spring. Although Changchun is named "Everlasting Spring," its people, like those everywhere, feel suffocated by the harsh winter and eagerly await the spring.

Madame Chiang's visit to Changchun represents the Central Government, Chairman Chiang, and compatriots from within the passes, extending condolences to the Northeastern compatriots who have suffered under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism for a full fourteen years. She brought a warm heart, and in Changchun, she radiated this warmth to the nine provinces of the Northeast, warming the hearts of forty million people. Although the season has not yet entered spring, the people of the Northeast, especially in Changchun, seem to feel that the spring they have been waiting for has arrived.

It has been more than five months since the Northeast was liberated from the Japanese iron heel. The long torment of fourteen years was certainly unbearable, but in the past five months, unrest caused by scattered troops and bandits in various places has deprived them of the relative stability they had managed to maintain during those difficult years. They are certainly excited about the victory won by the country's eight-year war of resistance! But after the victory, when they look around at their actual lives, they can't help but feel a sense of disappointment, as if it were a dream. "Are the people of the Northeast destined to suffer hardship?" They ask themselves, feeling lost.

Madame Chiang's arrival brought a sense of calm amidst the confusion. Forty million lonely and helpless hearts, warmed by the fervent heart Madame Chiang brought, are now closely united, breaking through the Great Wall; there is no longer a distinction between within and beyond the pass. The descendants of the Yellow Emperor are originally one family, and the pain of one family is felt by all. People in warmer places should also take responsibility for the desolation here.

Madame Chiang arrived in Changchun at two o'clock in the afternoon on the 22nd. Zhang Jia'ao, Chiang Ching-kuo, Dong Yanping, and women representatives from Harbin, Shenyang, Changchun, Songjiang, and Jilin had been waiting at the airport for half an hour before the "Meiling" aircraft landed. A representative of Soviet Marshal Malinovsky was also present to greet her. Noteworthy at the airport were the conversations between Chiang Ching-kuo and Zhang Jia'ao with Soviet officers. While the honor guard and band were certainly targets, little Jia Jinsheng, only eleven years old, holding a bouquet of flowers and preparing to give them to Madame Chiang, was the focus of the reporters' cameras.

Jia Jinsheng is a remarkably intelligent and pitiful little girl. She is currently in the third grade of elementary school. She has three siblings; she is the oldest, and the other two are younger brothers, the youngest of whom is only four years old. Her father, Jia Guilin, was killed by the Japanese on May 1, 1944, at the age of thirty-five, for engaging in underground work, leaving behind a wife and four children. In recent years, the orphans and widow have been supported by colleagues. When asked by reporters, she said, "When my father died, my mother and I were living at my grandmother's house in Jinzhou. We rushed here after receiving the news, but my father was already dead. Now, my mother is often sick at home."

When Madame Chiang's plane arrived in the airspace above the airport, the welcoming party lined up along the runway. At exactly two o'clock, the plane touched down amidst the sound of military music. Chiang Ching-kuo boarded the plane and helped Madame Chiang down. After introductions to the welcoming party and the presentation of flowers, the representative of Soviet Marshal Ma gave a speech. Afterwards, she reviewed the honor guard and left the airport by car. In that instant, the sound of cameras from Chinese and foreign reporters, though amidst the music, could still be clearly heard.

The car drove onto the main street, where it was met by citizens welcoming Madame Chiang. Two long lines of people stood on either side of the road. Madame Chiang got out of the car and walked a short distance, smiling and nodding to them as a greeting. The citizens, numbering over ten thousand, had been waiting by the roadside for a long time. Upon seeing Madame Chiang, they cheered loudly, as if they wanted to pour out all the pent-up depression, anger, and sorrow they had accumulated in their hearts for many years. Even as Madame Chiang's car drove far down the street, the cheers still resounded in their ears.

Security forces and Soviet guards were stationed along the street, standing upright with guns every few meters. The friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet armies was concretely demonstrated at this moment.

Unfortunately, Madame Chiang left Changchun again today. Her stay in Changchun, lasting less than three days, felt far too short. However, Madame Chiang told the women representatives that in the few days since she left Chongqing, Chairman Chiang had telegraphed her three times, urging her to return to Chongqing, where she also had many matters to attend to. She deeply regretted not being able to visit Shenyang, Harbin, and other places to extend her condolences, but in the near future, Chairman Chiang and she would return to the Northeast.

How the people of the Northeast admire Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang! Not to mention anything else, given the inconvenience of transportation, women representatives from as far away as Qiqihar and other places came to Changchun early to welcome her. They all longed to see Madame Chiang and to fully recount to her, the leader of the national recovery, their tragic experiences of the past years, so that their future fate might be given a chance to be remade. Furthermore, at the exhibition of photographs of Chairman Chiang and his wife's life, which began on the 18th and lasted for six days, the number of visitors was endless. The No. 1 Jinghua Elementary School, which had been deserted for a long time, was lively for a time in the snowy Northeast. On the streets, when the shops heard that Madame Chiang was coming to Changchun, many hung out banners at their doors saying "Welcome Madame Chiang's Arrival." Especially along the main street, several larger shopping malls made them even more elaborate and beautiful.

The people of the Northeast eagerly anticipated Madame Chiang's arrival before she came, warmly welcomed her when she came, and felt that her stay was too short when she left. However, the warm heart that Madame Chiang brought remained in Changchun and would be radiated from Changchun to the nine provinces of the Northeast.

Madame Chiang arrived in Changchun at two o'clock in the afternoon on the 22nd and left at eight o'clock in the morning on the 25th, spending less than seventy hours in Changchun. On the morning of the 23rd, she inspected the urban area. Although the buildings in the government and company district established by the Japanese to exploit the Northeastern compatriots were all substantial structures, she only passed by them in a cursory manner. In contrast, the more crowded, low, simple, dilapidated, and run-down the residential areas were, the more intently she gazed at them. Therefore, when she spoke at the civic assembly at noon on the 24th, she said that she had seen the poverty of the Northeastern people, who were in urgent need of relief under the ruthless oppression of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, she decided to launch a fundraising campaign after returning to Chongqing and ordered the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to transport materials to effectively and universally solve the poverty of the Northeastern people. Indeed, the once wealthy Northeast has now changed its appearance. Although the Japanese exploited it enough, it was all a spring dream that vanished into nothing.

At the tea party and award ceremony held by the headquarters in the afternoon of the 23rd, Madame Chiang, on behalf of the Chairman, presented medals to the Soviet allies who helped us recover the Northeast. Marshal Malinovsky had returned home to run for election and was not in Changchun. The person who gave a speech on his behalf expressed special respect. At this tea party, Zhang Jia'ao explained the significance of the labor union's visit to Changchun. The rain clouds that seemed to exist over the Northeast, the people's doubts about the government, and the friendship between China and the Soviet Union would all disappear due to Madame Chiang's arrival. On the same day, Madame Chiang also visited the hospital to comfort the families of the fallen underground workers.

On the 24th, Madame Chiang not only visited the Soviet headquarters, attended the civic assembly and the tea party for representatives from all walks of life, but also visited the orphanage. In the evening, she also attended the banquet held by the Soviet army at the former Kwantung Army headquarters.

During the visit to the Soviet headquarters, she asked the soldiers about their experiences, the firepower of their guns, and their shooting methods. She also asked them what they ate for lunch, opened the pot lid, looked at the steaming meat soup, and inquired for a long time. The beds in the bedrooms seemed too narrow to accommodate a person's body, and she asked if so many people could squeeze in. She also ate a meal here, keeping several white-clad maids busy for a while.

Madame Chiang's speech at the civic assembly deeply moved the audience. When speaking about the suffering of the Northeast, Madame Chiang showed infinite sympathy on her face, and her eyes were moist, which left an unforgettable mark on the hearts of the Northeastern people who had been slaughtered for fourteen years. Here, worker Zhao Kuiwu spoke on behalf of the citizens, expressing his hopes for the Northeast and the country in excitement and joy.

In the evening, the Soviet army hosted a banquet for Madame Chiang at the former Kwantung Army headquarters. The magnificent and luxurious Kwantung Army headquarters had the heating turned up high, making people feel as if it were spring. Many maids, exposing their snow-white arms, were busy running around like shuttles, making people never feel that this was a banquet in a military camp. One maid, leaning against the wall, even took off her shoes, and only a layer of flesh-colored stockings was sliding on the thick carpet. Chinese and Soviet national flags were hung on all four walls of the dining room, and extremely large portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Lenin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshal Stalin were hung on both sides of the restaurant. There were about a hundred Chinese and Soviet guests in total, with almost every two Chinese people accompanied by an ally, either a man or a woman. Toasts were raised to the friendship between the two countries, to the heads of state of the two countries, and to Madame Chiang. Vodka, brandy, and beer filled the tables, and they were drunk cup by cup. The allies' hearty drinking was truly admirable. Madame Chiang's speech during the banquet earned enthusiastic applause with every sentence, and the applause was accompanied by military music, making the applause even more thunderous. Chairman Trotsenko specifically stated that the foundation of friendship between the two countries should be built on economic and cultural cooperation. Madame Chiang severely criticized the cooperation that the Japanese Nazi fascist imperialism had talked about with our country in the past. She believed that the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union was based on understanding, so it could achieve true cooperation.

After the banquet, they watched a movie in another hall similar to a cinema, showing a victorious parade and sports games on the Red Square. In the second film, Chiang Ching-kuo appeared on the screen twice.

Speaking of Chiang Ching-kuo, from the time Madame Chiang came to Changchun until she left, he was the busiest person in those less than seventy hours. He translated both Chinese and Soviet languages, so every time there was a gathering of Chinese and Soviet people, he was probably the most stressed. (Fang Ren, January 25)

### Security Council Allows Iran and Soviet Union to Negotiate Directly to Resolve Disputes Until a Fair and Satisfactory Result is Achieved.

[Our Dispatch] According to a broadcast from London on the 30th, the Security Council met this afternoon. The Iranian representative stated that the Soviet representative's claim that Iran and the Soviet Union were actually engaged in direct negotiations was not accurate. The Iranian side had twice expressed its willingness to send a representative to Moscow, but it was rejected. The exchange of notes between the two countries cannot be regarded as direct negotiations. At this point, the Iranian representative paused for a few seconds and said in a low voice, "The Security Council must not give up dealing with Iran's complaint. However, at the last meeting, the Soviet Union proposed that the two sides negotiate directly. If the Security Council believes that Iran should indeed negotiate directly, then Iran will obey. However, all negotiations will be conducted under the supervision of the Security Council. Iran does not want the Security Council to abandon dealing with this complaint." At this point, Soviet representative Vyshinsky stood up and declared that the Soviet Union was very pleased that Iran was willing to negotiate directly. However, with regard to the Iranian proposal that the negotiations should be conducted under the supervision of the Security Council, I have something to say. If Iran is genuinely willing to seek security, not just verbally, then the only way is through negotiations between the two sides, not under the management of the Security Council. From the Soviet government's point of view, the exchange of notes between the two countries last year did not go through a third party, so it can be regarded as direct negotiations. The events in northern Iran were not caused by the pressure of the Soviet army, but by the genuine expression of the people of Azerbaijan." Subsequently, U.S. representative Stettinius proposed a compromise solution, which was supported by the representatives of China, France, and Poland. Stettinius suggested waiting for direct negotiations between the two sides, but the Security Council should be kept informed of the progress of the negotiations at any time, until a fair and satisfactory solution is achieved.

[United Press London, 30th] The United Nations Security Council continued to discuss the Soviet-Iranian dispute today. It is speculated that there may be a compromise solution. The Security Council may allow the two countries to negotiate directly, but must report the progress of the negotiations to the Security Council. Iran's new Prime Minister Sadar sent a telegram to British Prime Minister Attlee today, reaffirming the friendly relations between Britain and Iran, stating that "I believe that Britain will help the Iranian people fulfill their just and legitimate aspirations."

### Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie Accepts Appointment as Secretary-General of the United Nations

[Reuters Oslo, 30th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie has accepted the invitation of the Security Council to serve as Secretary-General of the United Nations. He left here by plane for London at 9:30 this morning. The United Nations General Assembly may formally approve Lie's appointment at a meeting on Friday.

[Central News Agency London, 29th Special Telegram] The problem of advancing the candidate for Secretary-General of the United Nations among the five great powers has finally been resolved satisfactorily. The Security Council held a closed meeting tonight, and all eleven member states agreed to nominate Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie to serve in the highest administrative position of the United Nations. Security Council Chairman Mejinye immediately telegraphed Oslo to seek his consent, thereby opening up the stalemate on this issue.

[Reuters London, 30th] The Security Council's unanimous recommendation of Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie as the first Secretary-General of the United Nations pleased representatives and observers in Westminster. Lie is generally recognized as the most suitable candidate. In addition to his personal integrity, there are two points that are generally felt to be gratifying: (1) It is recognized that this resolution was agreed upon by the five great powers in a closed meeting, which shows that the permanent members of the Security Council will no longer allow organizational issues to evolve into a divisive situation. (2) Since the site of the United Nations has been established in the United States, it is more balanced to have a European serve as Secretary-General. After Lie is elected, his political authority will be far greater than that of the Secretary-General of the old League of Nations. He can raise any event that threatens world peace and security to the Security Council, and the two thousand staff members of the United Nations will also be under his control. After taking office, Lie must first appoint staff, carefully selecting from the fifty-one countries. Those selected should swear to give up their original positions and serve the United Nations wholeheartedly, subject to the Secretary-General's deployment. Lie must also prepare the United Nations' budget and manage its income and expenditure. He may also serve as an intermediary or advisor for various governments. The Secretary-General's annual salary is nine thousand pounds. He can obtain free housing. He and the Assistant Secretary-General and their wives and children all enjoy diplomatic privileges.

### Brief Biography of UN Secretary General Trygve Lie: Humble origins, a genius for diplomacy.

[Associated Press London, 9th] Norway's foreign minister, Trygve Lie, elected Secretary-General of the United Nations, comes from humble origins. He is fifty years old, the son of a carpenter, with a burly figure and heroic appearance. He is a lawyer specializing in labor law with a natural talent for negotiation. When Lie became Norway's foreign minister in 1941, he had no international diplomatic background, but his life's work shows his passionate interest in Norwegian politics and labor law. Norwegians all know that he has the ability to resolve difficulties and bring the two sides to a compromise. In his spare time, Lie spends most of his time skiing and playing tennis. Lie, whose full name is Trygve Halvdan Lie, was born in Oslo. After graduating from the law department of Oslo University in 1919, he served as the secretary-general of the Norwegian Labor Party. In 1922, he became the legal advisor to the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions. By 1939, he was the Minister of Commerce and Shipping. In 1940, when the German army invaded, Lie was one of the last officials to leave Oslo.

### The First Session of the United Nations General Assembly May End on the Tenth of Next Month: The General Committee is Intensifying its Work

[Reuters London, 30th] The United Nations is now planning to conclude its meeting in London on February 10. Many of the secretaries of the United Nations agencies are suffering from colds, so the General Assembly has had to announce a recess for tomorrow, and the next plenary meeting has been postponed to Friday. However, at the General Committee meeting last night, it was estimated that a conclusion could be reached by February 10. The General Committee, which decides the affairs of the General Assembly, is now intensifying its work so that the committee stage of the General Assembly can be completed on Friday, so that the General Assembly plenary meeting can be held on Friday afternoon and Saturday, at which time the various committees will submit their reports. By the beginning of next week, the General Assembly will be ready to proceed with its final important task before the recess, namely, the election of judges of the International Court of Justice. This may take several days, but if this work is started on Monday or Tuesday, there are still several days to deal with any final recommendations that the delegations may make. After the General Assembly adjourns, the Security Council will continue its work. However, the agenda of the Security Council before the end of next week will include the three political issues of Iran, Greece, and Indonesia. The second part of the first session of the General Assembly will be held in the United States. The date is yet to be decided by the General Assembly. It was originally proposed to hold it in the United States in April, but the date may be changed because the three great powers have decided to convene a peace conference in Paris in May. Major politicians who are currently on their way to London to attend the General Assembly include French Foreign Minister Bidault, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie, and Greek Foreign Minister Rantis. Bidault left Paris for England this morning, Lie also left Oslo, and Randis is expected to leave Athens for London tomorrow to lead the Greek delegation in place of Sophoulis.

### Setting up Five Committees to Handle Social Problems

[United Press London, 30th] The United Nations General Assembly today unanimously approved the immediate establishment of five economic and social committees, including the Human Rights Committee. One of the Human Rights Committee's primary tasks is to begin studying the issue of freedom of the press that has been raised. Once the United Nations agencies are established in the United States, the U.S. delegation will urge the committee to first consider the issue of freedom of the press. Other committees will be responsible for handling temporary social problems, drug problems, and economic and occupational issues. The Human Rights Committee, as one of the important organs of the Economic and Social Council, will assist the Council in promoting human rights. In addition to preparing recommendations on the freedom of the press, its work will be responsible for drafting an international bill of rights and drafting agreements on human rights and freedoms, the status of women, the protection of minorities, and the prevention of discrimination based on race, gender, language, or religion.

### Our Military Delegation Takes the Road to India to England

[Reuters Karachi, 30th] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations Chiefs of Staff meeting in London, led by General Shang Zhen, arrived here yesterday.

### The Trusteeship Committee Begins Lively Discussions

[Reuters London, State Day] At the Trusteeship Committee meeting yesterday, there was a divergence of opinion on whether all dependent territories should uniformly obtain actual independence and autonomous government. U.S. representative Dulles believed that the trustee countries should guarantee these rights in order to give the local people hope and courage. Belgian representative Olt said that some territories are in fact unable to achieve independence or autonomy. If the Charter establishes a guaranteed provision, then these territories will also demand these rights. Therefore, he argued that the trustee countries do not have to make guarantees, but must immediately assist the dependent territories to reach a level where they can achieve independence and autonomous government. Australian representative Bailey agreed with the Belgian representative's opinion, while U.S. representative Dulles countered, "The terms 'independence and autonomous government' in the Charter do not legally bind the United Nations. We are practical politicians, not lawyers, so we should allow the people to be independent in order to be practical." The Committee agreed to refer the differing opinions of the U.S. and Belgian representatives to a sub-committee for deliberation.

### Administrative Budget Committee: Ecuador's Proposal Recommended for Rejection

[Central News Agency, London, 29th dispatch] At the afternoon meeting today of the Administrative Budget Subcommittee of the United Nations General Assembly, the representative of Ecuador proposed that the assessment of the United Nations membership fees should not follow the Preparatory Committee's suggestion of dividing the burden based on each member state's capacity, but should instead adopt a progressive system whereby each member state contributes according to a tiered scale. The proposal, initially presented yesterday, was put to a vote after two days of lengthy debate and was rejected by a vote of 20 to 19, with the United States, Iran, and Argentina abstaining. The representative of China, Hu Shih-tse, spoke against the proposal, pointing out the difficulty in estimating the resources of each country and determining the United Nations membership fee based on domestic tax revenue. Furthermore, he argued that the determination of each member state's fee amount involves diplomatic consultations and is not merely a mathematical calculation, thus the principle of paying membership fees according to each country's capacity is no different from a progressive system. The United States, known for its wealth, remained silent during the debate. After the vote, the U.S. representative stated that although the countries that supported the proposal were defeated, they should not be disappointed, and that the principle of dividing the United Nations membership fees according to each country's capacity implicitly contains the spirit of progression. The United States, in this spirit, is willing to pay its full share. However, the representative of Ecuador remained distrustful and reserved the right to submit the matter to the General Assembly for discussion.

### Election of Judges for the International Court of Justice to Commence Soon

[Central News Agency, London, 29th dispatch] According to the United Nations Secretariat, a total of 76 candidates have been nominated for judges of the International Court of Justice. The Security Council and the General Assembly will, in the next two weeks, select 15 judges for the International Court of Justice from the candidates. The Chinese candidates are Hsu Mo and Cheng Tien-hsi, the former nominated by China, and the latter nominated by the Netherlands.

### Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to be Handed Over to the Soviets: The U.S. and Soviet Union Agreed to Attack Japan: Explicitly Stipulated in the Yalta Agreement

[Reuters, Washington, 30th dispatch] Secretary of State Byrnes stated yesterday that the formal transfer of Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union still requires a peace treaty. According to Acting Secretary of State Acheson, who spoke while Byrnes was in London, the Yalta Conference resolution on the North Pacific region should not be considered a final decision. The Soviet news agency reiterated that the Yalta Agreement's resolution regarding these islands was final. Therefore, Secretary of State Byrnes issued a statement to the press yesterday clarifying the position. The Soviet news agency commented on Acheson's remarks, saying, "Mr. Acheson stated that, to his knowledge, the Yalta Agreement cannot be considered a final agreement to cede the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union. Mr. Acheson further stated that this was his personal opinion, which might be mistaken. The Soviet news agency is instructed to declare that Mr. Acheson's words are indeed mistaken." Byrnes stated that although he attended the Yalta Conference, he only learned of the agreement after Japan's surrender. He believed that President Truman learned of the agreement at the same time. The agreement was signed on the last day of the conference, and he was no longer present. The late President Roosevelt, due to the confidential nature of the document, personally kept it hidden in the White House. The Soviet Union originally agreed at the Crimean Conference to launch a war against Japan on a predetermined date. If the agreement on the Kuril Islands had been announced too early, everyone would have known that the Soviet Union was about to attack Japan. Therefore, when signing the agreement, the U.S. government believed that it should sign a peace treaty at an appropriate time to support the formal transfer of the territory to the Soviet Union. President Truman also shared this view. This was also indicated at the Potsdam Conference when the transfer of West Prussia to Poland was discussed. Byrnes further confirmed that the agreement on the North Pacific was not an oral agreement but a written agreement, which could be released now. Byrnes declined to discuss other islands in the Pacific that the United States wished to establish trusteeships over, stating only that the U.S. government believed that these matters should be resolved by peace treaties.

### U.S.-Soviet Commission Discusses Korean Problem

Conducted in a Friendly Atmosphere

[United Press, Seoul, 30th dispatch] The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission today issued its first communiqué, stating that the U.S. and Soviet sides have held eight meetings in a friendly and earnest atmosphere regarding the Korean problem. The agenda has been approved by both sides, and discussions on various issues can now begin. However, the communiqué did not mention when the commission would complete its discussion of economic issues and then proceed to discuss the complex political issues of Korea.

### Japanese Political Parties Launch Election Campaigns: Most Parties Still Use the Emperor as a Rallying Cry: Social Democratic Party and Communist Party Have Not Yet Joined Forces

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th dispatch] With the general election imminent, 31 Japanese political parties have begun their election campaigns. However, most of them are not overly optimistic about their chances of winning, as the candidates of the four major parties alone number 1,300. The Progressive Party, recognizing that the majority of the people still believe in the Emperor system, is using the Emperor system as a political weapon, declaring that it will absolutely protect the Emperor system and recognizing it as a just system, while denigrating the Democratic Front as a "lawyer's declaration." However, in fact, the party is working with the Front on the food issue for the people. Although the party suffered a major blow from MacArthur's fourth purge order in January, it will still nominate 400 candidates, 100 of whom are new replacements. The Liberal Party also holds the same attitude towards the Emperor system but advocates a free economy rather than the Progressive Party's planned economy, although it believes that controls may be necessary in the initial stage. The party's candidates will number at least 300. The Emperor system issue remains a major weapon in the election campaign, as the Social Democratic Party is still unwilling to join forces with the Communist Party to oppose the system. The party claims that since the Communist Party insists on overthrowing the Emperor system, the majority of the Japanese people will support the Social Democratic Party. The party will nominate over 300 candidates. The Communist Party is using the slogans of overthrowing the Shidehara cabinet, establishing a democratic front government, having the people control food, and raising wages as its election slogans, and is using this to appeal to salary earners and farmers as the main body of Communist Party candidates, hoping to appeal to the lower classes with the phrase "farmers will get land and workers will get protection." The party's candidates will number between 250 and 300.

### Britain to Open Far East Air Route: Via Shanghai, Hong Kong to Tokyo

[Reuters, London, 30th dispatch] It is reported that Britain may soon open a new air service to the Far East, including the "Dragon" route, via Shanghai and Hong Kong to Tokyo, a total of 9,000 miles. Initially, there may be two flights per week, gradually increasing to four. The fare to Hong Kong is £156, to Shanghai £169, and to Tokyo £187. The opening date is uncertain, but it is known that the existing route to Singapore will be expanded. Each route will require two or more nights in the air, so sleeping berths will be provided.

### French Assembly Trusts Government

[United Press, Paris, 29th dispatch] The French Constituent Assembly today passed a vote of confidence in the Gouin government by a vote of 514 to 51.

[United Press, Paris, 29th dispatch] French President Gouin declared today that France will continue to cooperate with the United Nations. New China was on the same side as us in this war and cannot be forgotten. He hoped that Spain could also join the United Nations, but it must first implement democracy. U.S.-French relations should be made even closer.

### U.S. Troops in the India-Burma Theater to be Transferred to China

Some officers may be leaving for China to serve in the near future. Soldiers who have not completed their terms of service will not be transferred to the China Theater until after May.

### Local Dispatches

Wuxi: Local Commodity Prices Soar Madly: Since the relocation, commodity prices in the county have been rising gradually. On Monday of this week, they soared madly. The reason for this is that there are rumors of currency changes. Those who have stocks of goods unanimously hoard them and refuse to sell them easily. This morning (29th), red gold sold for 98,000 yuan per tael, and silver ingots sold for 108,000 yuan per tael. White rice sold for 12,500 yuan per picul, and soybean oil sold for 37,000 yuan per dan. Wheat, soybeans, flour, and other commodities were also very expensive. As the end of the year approaches, fresh meat sells for 500 yuan per catty, fish for 400 yuan per catty, and pork for 400 yuan per catty. Mustard greens sell for 50 yuan per catty, and turnips for 20 yuan per catty.

Nanjing: Traitors in the Capital Dispatched to Suzhou in Batches (Shanghai News Agency report): Over 200 major and minor traitors, including Chen Kung-po, Chao Shu-yung, Mei Ssu-ping, and Lin Pai-sheng, arrested by the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army in Nanjing, are being held at No. 125 Ninghai Road. The General Headquarters has completed its investigation. Except for the arch-traitor Chen Kung-po and others, who will be interrogated after receiving orders from the National Government, the rest of the large batch of traitors are being prepared for transfer to the judicial organs. However, since the Capital High Court is not yet formally in operation, it was decided in consultation with Xie Ying-chou, Vice Minister of Judicial Administration of the General Headquarters, to transfer all of them to the Suzhou High Court for trial. It is reported that the first batch of 50 people will be completed within a month.

Hangzhou: Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway Opens Passenger Service:

The highway between Hangzhou and Ningbo has been repaired and opened to traffic. The journey takes two days from Hangzhou to Ningbo and one day from Ningbo to Hangzhou. From Hangzhou, one crosses the river at Sanlangmiao to Xidian and then to Shaodian. The car fare is 1,000 yuan. From Shao directly to Ningbo, the car fare is 2,400 yuan. It departs at 8:00 AM every day and arrives at 2:00 PM. In addition, the bus from Hangzhou to Huzhou had previously suspended service due to unfinished bridge construction. It has officially resumed service since the 26th, departing at 8:00 AM and arriving at 1:00 PM, with a fare of 2,200 yuan.

Jingjiang: Traitor Properties All Confiscated:

The properties of Yuan Lu-chen, Chen Yang-wu, Wang Hsi-san, Kuo Kuei-wen, Lu Chin-jen, Tao Ming-te, Chang Yi-chao, and Chen Ping-chih, who served as important officials in the puppet organization, have all been confiscated. Except for Yuan Lu-chen, who has died of illness, and Wang Hsi-san and Kuo Kuei-wen, who were executed by the New Fourth Army, the rest have all escaped. It is reported that an arrest warrant has been issued.

Huzhou: Traitor Cases Indicted: Since the Japanese army laid down their arms, the National Army was ordered to advance, and over 130 cases of major and minor traitors were arrested or reported in Wuxing County. All of these cases are being handled by Chen Wen-chi, Chief Prosecutor of the Wuxing District Court, and were transferred to the detention center on December 20th of last year for court interrogation. It is now reported that the most important traitors, including Chang Pai-chuan, "President of the Puppet Huzhou New Daily," Chang Po-ching, "Chairman of the Puppet Wuxing Chamber of Commerce," and the "Japanese Military Police Translator," have all been investigated and are accused of violating the Emergency Crimes Punishment Law for Harming the Republic of China and Articles 2 and 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. They have been indicted, and the remaining criminals are being strictly investigated.

Bengbu: Decline of Changhuai Shipping: The Huai River traverses northern Anhui, making navigation convenient. To maintain security on the water, the Changhuai Water Police Bureau was established. During the enemy-puppet occupation, it was reorganized into the Changhuai Water Police Brigade. After the victory, the Huai Water Police Bureau was restored. According to Lu Mu-tseng, the bureau chief, the bureau has recruited 100 police cadets and a volunteer team to improve the quality of the water police, and they are currently in training. The current Water Police Brigade is stationed upstream and downstream, but the police force has not been deployed in the areas occupied by the Communist army, such as Wuhe and Xuyi. Before the Incident, there were more than 30 regular passenger ships traveling upstream. They were almost completely destroyed during the military conflict. The remaining ships, such as Yong'an, Jianhua, Ruichun, and Lishang, are allocated by the Bengbu Shipping Office of the Anhui Highway Bureau. Although repeated negotiations have been made to recover them, they have not yet been returned. Currently, the only private ships operating upstream on the Changhuai River are Hengfa, Jia'e, Fenglehe, and Xinguoxing, which travel between Bengbu, Tianji'an, and Zhengyangguan. The shipping industry is in decline and it is difficult to restore it to its former state in a short time.

### Before the Ink Was Dry on the Sino-Siamese Treaty, Another Anti-Chinese Incident Erupted: When Li Tiehzeng Visited Nakhon Pathom, Siamese Police and Thugs Launched a Major Riot

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 30th dispatch] The head of the Chinese delegation, Li Tiehzeng, protested to the Siamese government because an anti-Chinese incident occurred in Nakhon Pathom when he visited the city on the 27th. He demanded that the perpetrators who attacked the overseas Chinese be appropriately punished, and the Siamese government guaranteed to provide appropriate protection to the overseas Chinese in the future. Prince Wan Waithayakon, the chief Siamese representative in the negotiations for the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, visited Li Tiehzeng yesterday, on behalf of the Siamese government, to express his regret for the unfortunate incident.

[Central News Agency, Nakhon Pathom, 27th dispatch] Four days after the signing of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, a twist occurred in Sino-Siamese relations. An anti-Chinese incident occurred in Nakhon Pathom today, with one overseas Chinese killed and several injured. This incident occurred when the Chinese delegation, led by Li Tiehzeng, came to the city. The city is located 55 kilometers west of Bangkok. Judging from the entire course of events, it was an organized and premeditated provocative action, possibly initiated by radical Siamese elements who sought to sabotage the visit of the Chinese delegation to demonstrate and undermine the friendship between the two countries. The incident occurred just as the welcoming meeting for the delegation by the overseas Chinese in Nakhon Pathom was about to begin. Thousands of overseas Chinese in the city participated in the meeting, as did the city's county magistrate and police chief. Li Tiehzeng and the city's county magistrate both emphasized the friendship between the two countries and urged the people of both countries to live in harmony. Li also advised the overseas Chinese to abide by the law and explained that they had obtained preferential treatment from the Siamese government with the conclusion of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. The meeting proceeded smoothly until Li and his party left the meeting and went to the local branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, when a gunshot suddenly rang out, and the overseas Chinese who attended the meeting fled in panic. The whole city was plunged into terror and chaos, and the unprecedented atmosphere of celebration in the city disappeared in an instant. During the chaos, the head of the delegation, Li Tiehzeng, remained calm and continued to travel by car to the overseas Chinese school for a welcoming luncheon hosted by the overseas Chinese in the city. The truth about the facts only became clear after the Chinese delegation returned from Banpong, 30 kilometers west of the city. After the welcoming meeting ended, several incidents occurred in quick succession. Siamese police and ruffians began to beat up overseas Chinese near the venue. When an overseas Chinese suddenly shouted at the end of the meeting and was about to investigate, he was shot, with two bullets hitting his back in vital areas. Another overseas Chinese was stabbed in the face. The Siamese person who committed the crime was later released. Two Siamese people took the opportunity to rob during the chaos. Two partner overseas Chinese butchers were not only forcibly robbed of 3,000 Siamese baht, but also brutally beaten. The two thugs also threatened to burn down their houses at night. After Li Tiehzeng and his party returned to Nakhon Pathom from Banpong, they went to the hospital to inspect the remains of the overseas Chinese who had been killed. The city's county magistrate and police chief deeply apologized to Li for the occurrence of such an incident during his visit to Nathon Pathom. They guaranteed to do their best to suppress future friction between the two sides and would report the matter to their superiors in Bangkok. After the shooting, the city's police chief ordered all Siamese police officers to return to the station. However, even though the Siamese police returned to the station, Siamese ruffians roamed the streets with clubs and other weapons in the evening, committing illegal acts and brutally beating any overseas Chinese they encountered, making the situation even more serious. While Li Tiehzeng and the city's police chief were waiting in the hospital for the autopsy results, another disturbance broke out, and overseas Chinese who were demolishing the bamboo sheds for the welcoming meeting were again severely beaten by groups of Siamese thugs. One overseas Chinese had his head and face broken and was sent to the hospital. The tense situation prompted former Dutch prisoners of war who were defending the area to suggest acting as neutral officers for the Siamese police. Li Tiehzeng and the city's county magistrate accepted the suggestion, and Dutch patrols and machine gun squads guarded the entire city. The Chinese delegation only left the city in the evening after receiving assurances from the local authorities that they would suppress the recurrence of similar incidents, and they were escorted by the city's county magistrate to a safe area far from the city. It is reported that when Li Tiehzeng arrived in Bangkok, he would take appropriate steps with the Siamese government regarding this matter.

### Student Demonstrations in the Provisional Capital Demand Unification, Peace, and Decisive Resolutions; All Members Pledge Successful Negotiations

— Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper on the 25th; Sent by Zhao Zhaosheng

On January 25th, Chongqing—this glorious city—shone with the pure calls of over ten thousand passionate young people. This day will be a radiant and blossoming day in the memories of young people across the country.

Over ten thousand students from Chongqing's Shapingba district, including those from National Central University, Chongqing University, Central Engineering School, the attached high school of National Central University, Chongqing High School, Shudu High School, Sichuan Institute of Education, Tongli Business School, National Vocational Schools, Yucai School, and others, held a joint demonstration and petition to promote the success of the Political Consultative Conference and to protest to Britain and France regarding the Pingshan Airport and the Beierding Incident. Their rigorous organization and excellent discipline established a model for the most outstanding democratic movement.

Making Big Banners from Bed Sheets

This large-scale action was first initiated by National Central University. They first held a meeting of department representatives to decide on the organization, principles, declarations, and slogans. At three o'clock in the morning on the 25th, after eating a little leftover porridge, they began preparing to depart. They used their own bed sheets and bamboo poles cut from Songlin Slope to erect large banners. The cold rain could not stop the passionate steps of the young people, and the long journey of more than thirty kilometers could not thwart their enthusiasm and determination. Starting from Shaba, this mighty team, organized into large and medium units by department, marched mightily towards Chongqing city. The people of Shapingba set off firecrackers to cheer them on. Faculty and staff organized service stations along the way to serve this glorious team. The students of the National Central University Baixi branch only learned of the news the afternoon before. Although it was a problem for these thousands of people to cross the river and hurry, they did not hesitate or consider. They stayed up all night making slogans and flags, crossed the river in the rain at midnight, and rushed to join the main force.

"Quick Reports" Printed in Cars

From Hualongqiao straight to Liziba, what a magnificent team, what glorious flags, what orderly ranks, and what magnificent shouts! Wu Youxun, President of National Central University, Sha Xuejun, Ren Meiyi, Ouyang Zhu, Liu Shichao, Jiang Mengyin, and other professors, Zhang Hongyuan, President of Chongqing University, Professor Ma Yinchu, as well as teaching assistants, lecturers, and even school workers were all in the ranks. Propaganda cars were distributing slogans and declarations and printing "Quick Reports" in the cars. Each student wore a symbol representing their department identity. The students of National Central University wore the gray military uniforms issued by the school. Although their clothes were poorer than those of the students eight years ago, this was precisely a mark of their glorious struggle. Disciplinarians rode bicycles to clear the road in front, behind, left, and right. Near Hualongqiao, two suspicious people were discovered in the team, immediately reported, and handed over to the military police. The lessons of past events have made Chinese youth calm and clear-headed, cultivating their high degree of vigilance.

At Niujiaotuo, they encountered Special Envoy Marshall passing by in a five-star marshal's car. He slowly followed the procession towards Qing Temple.

A little after eleven o'clock, the main force arrived at the National Government. Soon after, the team from the National Central University Baixi branch also arrived. The long journey of more than fifty kilometers left them covered in sweat, and everyone applauded to console them. At this time, from the highest level of the National Government Auditorium to outside the gate, was an endless crowd, with various colors and sizes of flags. Tens of thousands of people who had come with the procession were crowding in front of the National Government gate, and traffic on National Government Road was completely cut off.

Sun Ke Firmly Guarantees

"The Political Consultative Conference must succeed, not fail!" "National interests are above all else!" "Support Chairman Chiang's leadership in peaceful nation-building!" "No political party shall possess an army!" "Demand domestic unification, peace, and democracy!" "Thoroughly implement the ceasefire order!" "Both sides release political prisoners!" "Nationalize the army and democratize politics!" "Take back Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau!" "Replace the French Consul-General in Shanghai!" Magnificent slogans rang out here.

The members of the Political Consultative Conference were holding subgroup consultations in the National Government Auditorium and lounge. Student representatives first met with Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, to present their seven demands and invite representatives of various parties to speak. Facing these more than ten thousand pure and passionate young people, listening to these sky-shattering calls, no one was not sincerely moved. Then, Mr. Sun Ke first spoke. In front of the temporarily installed loudspeaker, he said loudly: I dare to firmly guarantee to all of you students that the Political Consultative Conference will definitely succeed perfectly within a few days! I fully agree with the slogans you are calling! The crowd burst into applause and cheers following President Sun's speech. Next, Zhou Enlai spoke, saying that the Communist Party also fully agreed with everyone's opinions. However, when he stated that the civil war had already stopped, the entire audience shouted loudly: "It hasn't stopped completely!" Zhou then explained to everyone that now, all parties and factions are working together under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to ensure that all problems are resolved perfectly. Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, Mo Dehui, Shao Lizi, and other gentlemen subsequently reported, unanimously agreeing with everyone's demands and guaranteeing that the Political Consultative Conference must succeed, not fail.

Tears Streamed Down Across the Entire Field

When everyone once again requested that a non-partisan representative speak, the elderly Mr. Mo Dehui, supported by someone, stepped down the steps from the National Government Auditorium. With the tears and ardent wishes of the Northeastern compatriots, he came to speak to everyone again. He said: This time, after returning from the Northeast via Tianjin and Beiping, the people asked him to convey to the Political Consultative Conference, "They can no longer suffer from the scourge of war! Whoever wants to fight, I will risk my old life to fight him!" The old gentleman was trembling all over with excitement, his tears streaming down, sobbing uncontrollably. National Central University President Wu cried, and all the students and the crowd crowding outside the National Government gate cried. The reporter standing next to the loudspeaker was recording these moving words with his entire life, listening to the sad and trembling gasps of this white-haired old man, and also burst into tears unconsciously. Yes, cry! Recognize the truth through tears. Only those who can cry are those who understand love and hate! In the National Government Square, at this moment, the pure tears of millions of people were communicating with the tears of the struggling compatriots in North China!

Mo Dehui Makes a Great Appeal

Mr. Mo also said in an extremely firm and passionate voice: Eight years ago, at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang had explained to him his determination to "resist to the end." In his old age, he struggled for eight years under the inspiration of the Chairman. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, today, he is willing to explain to everyone with his own belief: Chairman Chiang will definitely be able to overcome all obstacles and make this meeting a success. If this meeting is not successful, he will suggest to Chairman Chiang not to close the meeting, and he himself will not leave here and will not return to the Northeast. "Young brothers! Whether our country can stand among the four powers in the future depends on whether the Political Consultative Conference can succeed!" Mr. Mo's appeal caused excitement across the entire field, which lasted for a long time.

Then the presidium announced that the parade was about to begin. Office staff distributed steamed buns at this time. Everyone chewed on the dry steamed buns they brought, sitting on the ground. Before the boiled water was delivered, the parade had already begun to depart. From the National Government—Shangqing Temple—Lianglukou—Qixinggang—Douyu Street—Huiping Street—Zhongzheng Road—Kaixuan Road—Linsen Road—Heping Road, the people in the urban area welcomed this glorious team with even greater cheers. The Chongqing news reporters, as well as the American financial advisor Yang Ge, and his colleague Steel, were all running alongside them. In the consulate lane, in front of the British and French embassies, everyone pasted more English slogans and shouted English slogans. People who came out of the embassies stared at the crowd shouting for the protection of national rights and interests.

At five o'clock, the parade ended, and over ten thousand pure young people had perfectly completed this magnificent and moving epic, and joy and excitement illuminated their return journey.

American Medical Community Invents Hemostatic Cotton Wound Treatment

A preparation specialist at an American private laboratory installed a temperature regulator on a vacuum oven used for drying blood. The newly made hemostatic cotton can be used by surgeons. The method involves extracting plasma from human blood, then using the blood clot to make a kind of product, followed by protein, a protein element in the blood. Once it encounters air, it causes the blood to clot, preventing excessive bleeding from the wound. The protein foam on the surgical wound can be converted into a blood clot. When applied, it is placed on the wound and allowed the blood to gradually absorb it. This kind of hemostatic cotton can not only prevent excessive bleeding during surgery, but also prevent the risk of massive bleeding after surgery.

### Retrospective on the Life of Harry Hopkins, Former Personal Advisor to President Roosevelt

The Passing of an American Brain Trust

This Newspaper Archives

The news of Mr. Hopkins' death yesterday shocked the entire American nation, and even the soldiers and civilians of the United Nations mourned together, because he was a classmate of the late President Roosevelt and a powerful figure who assisted him in defeating the Nazi enemy. His brief history is recorded below:

Impoverished Family; Son of a Harness Maker

Harry Hopkins' family was very poor in his childhood. His father was a harness maker in Grinnell, Iowa. Although Hopkins' family was very poor, under the strong leadership of his father, he finally completed his university education and obtained a Doctor of Laws degree. At the age of fifteen, he began to engage in social work, serving as an investigator for the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, delving into every poor community, conducting on-the-ground investigations of the lives of the poor, and seeing every dark side of the lower class. This was of great help to the development of his future life experience and career.

World War I; Enlisted in Red Cross Service

In 1917, the United States was involved in the First European War, and Hopkins joined the Red Cross to serve as the director of the Gulf of Mexico, burying himself in relief work. In 1922, he returned to New York and served as the vice president of the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. Two years later, he was appointed as the secretary-general of the New York Tuberculosis Association.

His acquaintance with Roosevelt dates back to the time of the American presidential election in 1928. At that time, Roosevelt was the governor of New York State. In order to gain public confidence, Roosevelt organized the "Temporary Emergency Relief Administration" to plan a large-scale relief effort for 800,000 unemployed people. Hopkins was appointed as the vice president of the association at that time. A year later, he was promoted to president, fully responsible for the large-scale relief efforts in New York State. Due to his capable handling of affairs, from this time on, his political status gradually rose and he was noticed.

In 1933, Roosevelt was elected president. In January of 1934, Roosevelt appointed him as Secretary of Commerce. Although he had detailed plans for the reform of the Department of Commerce, he suffered from a very serious stomach illness at that time, and his health was abnormal, and much time was spent traveling to various places for recuperation.

From 1939, Hopkins served as Roosevelt's personal advisor, planning extensively during the depression and war, and Roosevelt relied on him as a confidant. In Washington, his reputation was not very prominent. During the war, Hopkins served not only as the President's Advisor, but also as Chairman of the Munitions Board.

Followed Roosevelt and Attended Major Conferences

He participated in the Casablanca Conference, the Quebec Conference, the Cairo Conference, the Tehran Conference, and the Yalta Conference. He also attended the famous shipboard conference in August 1941, where the Atlantic Charter was drafted. During the war, he represented President Roosevelt on four visits to London. After Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Roosevelt urgently sent Hopkins to see Stalin. Upon returning to the United States, he reported to Congress that the Soviet Union was determined to fight to the end. In 1938, as Secretary of Commerce, he attended the Senate to testify about his relationship with President Roosevelt, stating: "Since I have been appointed by the President as an administrator, I have served the President and trusted the President. If the Senate approves the appointment, I can predict that what is approved is someone who will wholeheartedly serve the President and advocate for the President's ideas, and since I trust the President's ideas, I should, of course, be loyal to the President."

Outstanding Talent; Appreciated by Stalin

Stalin appreciated Hopkins more than any other United Nations official. After returning from a visit to the Soviet Union last summer, his health deteriorated, and he soon retired. Later, he accepted the position of chairman of the New York Women's Clothing Industry, specializing in arbitration of wages and other labor issues.

Hopkins's second wife was Ms. St. Macy, whom he married at the White House in July 1942. His first wife had two sons and a daughter. His son was killed in action in the Marshall Islands.

Hopkins was 56 years old.

### The Mansion of Secret Books, the Mountain of Precious Stones: The Old Collection of Haiyuan Pavilion Is Now Preserved by the Beiping Library

The books of the Haiyuan Pavilion of the Yang family in Liaocheng were recently purchased by President Song in Tianjin for 15 million legal tender, nationalized, and kept in the reading room of the Beiping Library. These treasures were acquired fifteen years ago by the Cunhai Academy, organized by Zhang Ting'e, Mo Yulin, and others, and stored in the Tianjin Salt Industry Bank. After browsing through it a few years ago, Zangyuan Jushi Chuan Zengxiang wrote "A Brief Account of the Collection of Haiyuan Pavilion," which explained in detail the existing rare books. The original text is excerpted below for reference by those who care about it at home and abroad.

Since the books of the Haiyuan Pavilion of the Yang family in Liaocheng were scattered, all scholars who love books and antiquities, as well as contemporary famous officials and giant townships, have rushed to inform each other and plan a way to preserve them, either searching in glass factories, or visiting the capitals of Shandong, or consulting with the descendants of the Yang family.

In our country in the last hundred years, the great book collectors, Southern Zhai and Northern Yang, are known throughout the country for their grand and rich collections. The source and transmission of ancient books are fully documented. If the Zhimi Tower of the Lu family and the Eight Thousand Volume Tower of the Yao family are newly built states, they are not enough to be mentioned in the same breath.

Since the news of the loss of the cabinet books came out, the factory estimators ran around, west to Baoding, Shunde, and Daming, east to Fuzhou, Jinan, and Qingdao, rising like clouds and surging like waves, exhausting their efforts to search and gather them in various shops in Tianjin and Beijing, while the descendants of the Yang family, due to living in exile and depleting their property, also sold their collections in order to seek a good price. In the past two or three years, slightly less than half of those scattered have been lost. When I was a guest in Tianjin last year, I saw the second series of Song editions, a total of twenty-six copies, and most of them were taken away by powerful people one after another. Because I did not have the money to try to eat a slice of the pie, the secret books copied and collated that appeared in Haiwang Village were also almost completely purchased by official institutions and private families, and often even a small volume of copied and collated books was priced at a thousand gold, let alone the ancient Song and Yuan editions. The speaker then said that the essence of the Song Cun Room was almost exhausted, but judging from the direct appreciation, the matter was not necessarily so. According to the Yang family's collection, it is known as beautiful and rich, but what their father and son are especially proud of is only the Four Classics and Four Histories, so they separately titled the studio name in the Song Book Room, and Mei Boyan wrote the Haiyuan Pavilion Records, saying that those who rank books after the Six Arts and various philosophers and poetry are all streams, not their source.

Now, let us list the precious and secret ones separately on the left. Those that have not been fully viewed in a hurry have not been detailed. The Song edition of the Mao Poetry, is an exquisite pocket-sized edition. The Song edition of the Shangshu Cai Shi Zhuan is a large-character, exquisite, and rare. The Song edition of the Book of Rites is a former possession of the Ming Xing's Laiqin Hall. The Song Fuzhou edition of the Book of Rites is an early print with paper as clean as jade and ink as black as lacquer. The Song Qiandao edition of the Records of the Grand Historian is carved with exquisite skill. This is the first edition of the Records of the Grand Historian annotated by three scholars, which I have never seen in my life. The Song edition of the Book of Han is a large-character, elegant and beautiful copy with hooks and strokes drawn in silver. The Song edition of the Book of Later Han is as elegant and vigorous as the Records of the Grand Historian. It is the most exquisite edition after the Jianben edition. The Song edition of the Records of the Three Kingdoms is the rarest of the Song editions of the Records of the Three Kingdoms, and it is more difficult to obtain than a fine print. The Song edition of Shishuo is a unique copy in the country. The Song edition of the Spring and Autumn Annals Name Diagram is a fine copy formerly owned by Jigu. The Song edition of the Great Dai Ritual Record is the rarest and most secret, and I am afraid that there are no two copies in the world. The Song edition of Zhu Wengong's Family Ritual is a large-character, exquisite, and neat copy. The Song edition of Lishu is elegant and pleasing to the eye. The original title was mistakenly written as a copy. The Song edition of the Book of Han. The Song edition of the Book of Later Han. Although there are Yuan revisions in one book, it is extremely difficult to obtain a complete copy. The Song edition of Zizhi Tongjian Kaoyi is a fine print on thin paper carved in the early Southern Song Dynasty. The Song edition of Liang Han Chuan Kai is ancient, elegant, and rare. The Song edition of Fang Yu Sheng Lan is a book that is often damaged. This copy is uniquely printed early and is complete and valuable. The Song edition of Zheng Lei Bencao is carved in the ancient style of Sichuan and is rare in the world. The Song edition of Lisao is a book of drafts, a unique secret book. The Song edition of Luo Binwang's Collection is a Song Sichuan edition, which is ancient, elegant, and unparalleled. The copy is also exquisite. The Song edition of Yuan Feng Lei Gao is a large-character, elegant, and vigorous copy. The Song edition of Shi Jinshanshui Ji is the only copy in the world, carved in an ancient and elegant style. The Song edition of Liu Houchun Ji is exquisite, clean, and complete. The Yuan edition of Le Shu is neat and orderly, and I suspect that it is a Song edition. The Yuan edition of Erya is a fine early print. The Mao manuscript of Shiyao Erya. The Mao manuscript of Han Jian. The Mao manuscript of Xikun Chouchang Ji. (The above three books are finely written by Jigu and should be treasured as much as Song editions.) In addition, there are many fine Song and Yuan editions of various books, but they are commonly seen in my life and will not be mentioned again. As for the various copies and collations, most of them are famous works by Lu Leiguang, He Yimen, Gu Qianli, and Zhang Ren'an, and Huang Ruoyan collated more than ten kinds, and most of them are based on ancient books, and they are also Song Ping editions, which are especially valuable, which are one level lower than Song editions. In recent years, cultural and educational revival, and the love of books and antiquities, has become a fashion. When people occasionally see ancient engravings and old manuscripts, they are all shocked and regard them as treasures. Even those who obtain one or two elevate themselves and issue proclamations to solicit titles. This is what Qian Shou'an called the poor eyes of the Wu people. If they were to see this, what would they think? In conclusion, the Yang family's books were accumulated in ten thousand volumes and preserved for three generations, but now they have been scattered in one day, and everyone in the country sighs and regrets it. If you want to collect and search for them and restore them to their former glory, it is not an easy task, but according to what I have seen, there are still less than half of the remaining books.

### Report on the Real Situation in Northern Jiangsu

Mr. Editor: I was deeply moved after reading your newspaper's article "The Communist Party's Benevolent Governance in Yantai" yesterday. We, who live in Northern Jiangsu, suffer greatly, all caused by the Communist Party, and there is even worse. Now, briefly describe the following: The Communist Party treats human life like child's play. For example, Sheng Jie, the district chief of Jitang District, Dongtai, kills several people every day on average. Also, the instructor Ma Bin also enjoys killing people. On average, more than 300 people are killed by the above two in half a year, so the number of people who died at the hands of the two is unknown. Anyone living in their area cannot talk about freedom at all. Being able to keep one's life intact is a great blessing. What "democracy" is there? If young people do not participate in work or join the "Party," they are said to be waiting for the "old central government" and accused of being "national special agents," and are sentenced to death, or thrown into the water to drown, or buried alive in the soil to suffocate, or thrown into the fire to burn to death. Their doctrine is "If you are not for me, I will not keep you." What is even more ridiculous is that when nothing is happening, young women are invited to the assembly field to "confess" private matters, and they are told to say, "How many lovers do you have? When did you meet secretly?..." Everything must be "confessed" and reported, and we will all attack and insult them, saying that if you do not "confess," you are not worthy of being a person under the rule of the Communist Party. Therefore, young people and women have fled to Shanghai, Nantong, Taizhou and other places, waiting for the National Army to descend, like hoping for rain in a severe drought. In the Yancheng-Funing area, there is also a so-called "Smell Fragrance Team." If a family's diet is slightly better, such as eating fish and meat, they will smell it, or suddenly break in and see the pot lid, and immediately consider it a capitalist enjoying life, and immediately confiscate the property. There are also "Nimble Girl" (female detectives), one nimble girl is sent to manage every ten households, who can enter and leave houses freely and investigate the situation of the ten households. If the words are slightly inconsistent, they are named "national special agents," detained for investigation, and even shot. Other things, such as Shanghai newspapers and legal tender, are prohibited from entering the country, which we believe is for special work. Recently, someone from northern Jiangsu said that they are now arresting men to enlist in the army, gathering a large number of young people, waiting to be developed. Therefore, the people of northern Jiangsu have recently been in deep water and are looking forward to the National Army entering day and night to relieve the urgent need. The above are all the real situations in northern Jiangsu. Please publish it in your newspaper as a blessing. A youth from a brigade in northern Jiangsu. January 28th.

Procuring Grain and Levying Grain

Mr. Editor: The country has been fighting for eight years, the soldiers have been fighting bloody battles for eight years, the people in the rear have been bearing heavy burdens for eight years, and the people in the occupied areas have been squeezed for eight years. Everyone is living through hardship. The Japanese pirates felt the threat of the Allied countries and surrendered unconditionally. Chairman Chiang sympathized with the people in the occupied areas and exempted land taxes and reduced rents. The people were celebrating and thanking Chairman Chiang's kindness, but soon something that made the people laugh and cry came. In the past, our country has always purchased military rice through rice merchants, but this time it also followed the method during the occupation period, apportioning it to households according to the fields and collecting it at a low price. The people suffered such a loss. Wouldn't they laugh and cry? But is this method the same in all recovered provinces? Or is it just Wuxi County? According to the current market price, each stone of brown rice requires more than 8,000 legal tender, while the assigned price can only get 4,500 legal tender after deducting the delivery fee. Who knows such a dark loss? Even the money can only be received after the rice is delivered. The procedures are troublesome, and the piecemeal dismantling is very large. Isn't it unfair! The Japanese pirates forced the collection, and the stored grain was abundant, which could be used, but why was there no gain? Cao Weizhi, Wuxi.

The Preparatory Class is Late to Start School

Mr. Editor: I sincerely hope that you can give me a corner of valuable space in your newspaper to publish it. It is really frustrating to say. I am a high school graduate who happened to graduate under the rule of the "enemy puppets." At that time, because I did not go to take the "puppet" national university exam, I was delayed and never entered the door of the university. I thought that there would be a better arrangement after the victory. Who knows how dissatisfied the facts will give us. I am afraid that the people from all walks of life who uphold justice will not believe it! After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang set up a temporary university tutorial class in Beijing, Shanghai and other places to care for the out-of-school youth in the recovered areas, but they were rejected because they were not "puppet university" students. Fortunately, the preparatory class was set up accordingly. I tried again. After an entrance examination, I finally "sailed smoothly" and was "on the list." I always thought that I could start school and attend classes soon, but I still don't know anything about it. However, several high school classmates who took the "puppet university" exam are gloriously attending tutorial classes! Mr. Editor, is this the disappointment brought by the victory, but the education authorities are rewarding them and punishing us? Furthermore, there is clearly such a clause on the enrollment advertisement of the preparatory class "...From the date of the start of school to July 20th of the 35th year, there will be no winter vacation to complete a one-year academic program..." Such a strange and grand rhetoric, now that people are on winter vacation, it is still a "start date to be notified separately." Is this a sign that there will be no winter vacation? I don't like to see grandiose words, I don't like to hear pleasing perfunctory remarks, I just ask to give me a quick arrangement, a really practical arrangement, and don't post announcements, no matter how many announcements, the facts are still the facts, please don't underestimate it anymore, gentlemen. Maybe these adults and gentlemen are somersaulting in "waiting for cause and obeying," or suffering from severe "amnesia"? People are recruiting, starting school and attending classes again, but what about us...? If the preparatory class authorities think that it will still take a considerable amount of time to attend classes, it is okay to allow us to take back our certificates, but we still need to maintain the academic quota. "Let us take other university exams, and don't forget that our certificates are being "kept" by you. I know that many of these students must be hoping for it too! Rhyme, January 29th.

Editorial

### On the Issue of Setting the Value of Currency

A recent Associated Press dispatch from Washington stated that officials in Washington are closely watching the development of China's trade. According to the news from the dispatch, American officials and businessmen believe that it is currently impossible to be overly optimistic about the early resumption of large-scale trade between China and the United States. They believe that even if China achieves political stability, economic and legal obstacles will still be numerous. American officials believe that China's main problem at the moment is the determination of a "realistic" exchange rate. Only after this exchange rate is issued can trade activities with China begin. However, they also believe that before determining this exchange rate, the Chinese government will be forced to issue a new currency system, so the Chinese government will carefully consider the determination of the new exchange rate. The Bretton Woods Agreement stipulates that countries that sign the agreement shall not exceed 10% of the value of their currency without the consent of this international organization, and China is one of the signatories to this international agreement. If the determination of the new exchange rate is impractical, it will not only fail to help China's foreign trade recover, but will also be harmful. In addition, American officials have also pointed out the new company law in our country, believing that the clause that foreign companies must have a head office in a foreign country will be detrimental to China and run counter to the original intention of welcoming foreign investment. What we should pay special attention to in this dispatch is the issue of our country's currency system. This is indeed not only related to the recovery of our country's foreign trade, but also related to the prosperity and decline of our entire national economy and the stability of social order. I would like to express my views on this matter.

First of all, we want to declare that a country will inevitably cause currency problems and related currency reform issues after a long period of war. This was the case with France and Germany after the First World War, and the United Kingdom and the United States also had currency reform issues one after another. Although the abolition of the gold standard in the United Kingdom and the devaluation of the US dollar did not happen immediately after the war, the reason for the problems was closely related to the First World War. During the Second World War, it goes without saying that the currency systems of Germany, Italy and Japan had problems. France also had its serious currency problems, which I will not mention much. Even the UK and the US themselves had currency problems, but their problems were not very obvious. However, the general decline in the purchasing power of currency is a fact. Our country has been fighting for the longest time and has suffered the most financial trauma. Therefore, our currency problem is particularly serious. This problem does not end with the end of the war; in a sense, the end of the war is the beginning of this problem. In the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we had to rely on printing machines and constantly manufacture new legal tender to cope with war expenses and national expenditures in a financial situation where tax sources were exhausted. This is not something to be ashamed of. This is also the case in the UK and the US, but they naturally managed it very well, so there was no such increasingly serious problem as ours. Our people should forgive the government for having to rely on increasing issuance to cope with the national treasury during the war. However, increasing issuance is a poisonous drug, somewhat like drinking poison to quench thirst. Today, all problems can be related to currency issues, and there is no talk of any recovery if financial affairs are not properly managed after the war! Our people should forgive the government for relying on issuance to maintain the national treasury during the war; but the war has ended for nearly half a year, and the government should quickly seek a solution to the currency problem. Otherwise, if the problem becomes serious, how will it face the people?

At present, China's currency system can be said to be extremely chaotic. It goes without saying that the counterfeit currency issued by the enemy puppet government, even in terms of legal currency, the legal currency in the recovered areas of Jinghu and Jiangnan forms a system, the legal currency in North China forms a system, and the legal currency in Northeast China forms a system. In addition, Taiwan forms a system. Such a complex system is indeed an inevitable situation caused by coping with the surrender at that time, but this situation cannot be allowed to continue for a long time. This requires a quick reorganization. However, this is only a superficial problem; the core of the problem is how to seek the stability of the currency value. If the currency value cannot be stabilized, all currency system reforms will be impossible to implement; and if the currency system is not reformed, not only will all financial reforms be impossible to implement, but also the country's recovery will not be able to get on the right track.

It is doubtful whether the re-determination of the exchange rate can stabilize the value of the currency. If the currency cannot be stabilized, it will inevitably affect the re-determination of the exchange rate. This cycle will become a vicious cycle, which will not help solve the actual problem, and may even make the problem more serious. We are not in a position to speculate on what the American officials mean by the determination of a "realistic" exchange rate. If the current black market exchange rate is used to stabilize the Chinese legal tender at around 1,500 yuan, although it is a "realistic" decision, it will be harmful to the development of China's national economy and will undoubtedly become a blow to my country's growing national industry. In terms of current prices, some Chinese-made products will not be able to compete with imported products. Therefore, the determination of a "realistic" exchange rate is not only a monetary problem, but also a tariff problem. We must seek the determination of a "realistic" exchange rate in the application of tariff policies. As for the widely spread multi-tier exchange rate system, if we can properly use tariff policies without any resistance, there is no need for such complicated measures.

Stabilizing the currency value has two meanings: one is to seek the stability of the domestic currency value; the other is to seek the stability of the foreign currency value. The former is somewhat determined by the latter, and the latter is somewhat sufficient to affect the former. The currency problem in our country today involves too many things. In the effort to reorganize the currency system, what is needed is a spirit of perseverance and decisiveness, and a bold and decisive style. The financial and monetary system, which is already terminally ill, can only be revived by major surgery. Our country's pre-war currency system was not sound, and now it is riddled with holes. A thorough reform should be carried out in due course. Germany's reorganization of the Mark after the First World War and Russia's reorganization of the Ruble can be used as our reference. It is currently rumored in Shanghai that the government is about to issue "Sun" currency. Although Yu Yuzhang has denied it, we believe that, given the current situation, even if the new currency is not issued for a while, it may no longer be possible to solve our currency problem by relying solely on the re-determination of the exchange rate.

In short, how to solve the current currency problem is the government's top priority. In Shanghai, prices have been rising since the recovery nearly four months ago, which means that the currency value has been falling. We cannot attribute the rise in prices to other factors. We must know that this is mainly a currency problem. The social unrest, the turbulence in people's lives, and the difficulties in the government's finances are all due to the fact that this problem has not been reasonably resolved. The government should deal with this problem as soon as possible and take appropriate measures so that all other problems can be gradually resolved and gradually return to normal.

### Song Chang arrived in Shanghai by air yesterday after the temporary suspension of his trip to Taiwan, and Ms. Hu Linlan arrived on the same flight

Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen flew from Guangzhou to Shanghai Longhua Airport at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Those who came with him included Counselor Xu Shilu, Secretary Zhu Zhongdao, Ji Ping, Yin Birong, Zhou Yuemei, Adjutant Lai Zhanpeng, etc. Miss Hu Zhantang's daughter, Mulan, also came to Shanghai on the same flight. After Song got off the plane, he rested briefly, and at 4:00 p.m., he went to the President's Office of the Bank of China Building. He immediately summoned Huang Boqiao, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan President's Office in Shanghai, Chen Hang, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager, Qian Changzhao of the Resources Committee, etc. They left at 7:00 p.m. According to reporters, Song and his party originally planned to fly to Taiwan at 8:00 a.m. on the 29th, but unexpectedly, the plane experienced obstacles when it was only a foot away from the ground, so they had to land for repairs. They then received a telegram from Taiwan stating that the weather there had suddenly changed and was not suitable for navigation, so the trip to Taiwan was temporarily suspended, and they changed to take a flight to Shanghai at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. It is also learned that President Song has established the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Enemy Puppet Industry Processing Bureau in Guangzhou, with Du Jiyong, the former special envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian, as the director. The former Guangdong Enemy Puppet Industry Office has been cancelled.

### Labor representatives' words and deeds are inconsistent, and the power labor unrest has twists and turns again. Most workshops are disappointed

The power company's labor unrest was personally mediated by Director Wu Kaixian the day before yesterday, and the stalemate could have been broken. Even late at night, the situation changed again due to the change in the attitude of the labor representatives. The following is a record of Director Wu's mediation yesterday.

Wu Kaixian explained earnestly

At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, representatives from both sides continued to negotiate at the Social Bureau, and the talks became closer and closer. Regarding the labor representatives' request for a uniform 10% pension, after several rounds of coordination by the Social Bureau, the company representatives have expressed their acceptance, and the two sides are getting closer and closer. The labor representatives are arguing about the reinstatement and reasonable salary increase of the five temporary workers. After 5:00 p.m., Director Wu, after consulting the opinions of the capital representatives on various issues, summoned labor representatives Ouyang Zhirun and others for talks. Land Commissioner Jingshi, Wang Committee Member Xianqing, Zhang Section Chief Zhenyuan, and representatives of the five major public utilities trade unions were present. Director Wu explained each of the eleven conditions proposed by the labor representatives that still needed to be discussed. Regarding the reinstatement of the five temporary workers and the rationalization of this year's salary increase, he expressed his views, saying that the capital representatives had provided contracts to prove that there were sufficient reasons for the dismissal of the five temporary workers, but he personally sympathized with the five workers and was willing to provide assistance. In addition to instructing the capital representatives to issue an additional month's salary as severance pay, he would do his best to find a job for them. Regarding the rationalization of the salary increase, the labor and capital sides had previously reached an agreement and provided various materials, and submitted them to the municipal government for arbitration. He would urge the municipal government to submit them to arbitration as soon as possible to speed up the solution, and hoped to resume work first tomorrow, and he would do his best to seek a reasonable solution for everyone. After speaking, the whole audience applauded warmly.

Labor representatives volunteered to persuade

Labor representative Ouyang Zhirun immediately expressed his intention to return to the factory and persuade all workers to resume work first. Director Wu asked whether the Social Bureau needed to send representatives to the power company with the municipal party department to jointly persuade them. Ouyang replied that he would be responsible for persuading all workers to resume work first, and the Social Bureau and the municipal party department did not need to send representatives. Representatives of the five major public utilities, the telephone company, the water company, the French tram company, the British tram company and the gas company, were also very excited and willing to accompany the labor representatives to the factory to jointly persuade all employees to resume work first.

Sudden change of attitude, opposed to resuming work

According to reporters who inquired late at night: When the representative of the power company, Ouyang Zhirun, left the Social Bureau, he suddenly refused the representatives of the five major public utilities companies to go to the power company to persuade them. After Ouyang and others returned to the power company, they did not convene a meeting of all workers, but only held a meeting of directors and supervisors. The discussion continued until 11:00 p.m. Because Ouyang and others firmly opposed resuming work, there was no result. Most workers were eager to return home because the Lunar New Year was approaching, and they were quite disappointed.

Lieutenant Colonel Handlong personally went to Tokyo, Nanjing and other places to investigate Okada's arrest, which lasted for more than a month before he was captured in Shanghai. It is heard that the US military court will formally open trial against Okada in the shortest possible time, and the other four Japanese war criminals who murdered the American airmen are still being investigated and arrested.

### The Previous Night, in Dense Fog and Rain, an American Transport Plane Crashed; Passengers Jumped Out, Not Yet Found

[United Press Dispatch] On the night of the 29th, in dense fog and rain, an American C-64 type army transport plane, upon approaching the Jiangwan Airport, was unable to land.

### Another American Plane Returns Near Taiwan

An American Air Transport Command C-47 transport plane was forced to land in the sea near a small island in southern Taiwan on Monday afternoon.

The C-47 transport plane took off from Taipei, northern Taiwan, at 1:45 PM (Shanghai time) on Monday, the 28th, bound for Shanghai. Before reaching Shanghai, due to bad weather, it was ordered to return to Taiwan. Discovering that the weather in Taipei was equally bad, and while searching for a suitable airfield for landing, it was forced to land on the South China Sea near Taiwan due to running out of fuel. On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Navy dispatched twelve planes and several destroyers to search for the crashed plane.

### Commissioner Cheng Inspects Various Counties in Jiangnan; Returns to Shanghai After Completing His Mission; Special Attention Paid to the Freedom of the People During This Trip

Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner Cheng Zhonghang returned to Shanghai from Nanjing the night before after inspecting various counties in Jiangnan. Yesterday, this reporter visited Commissioner Cheng to inquire about his impressions of the trip. Commissioner Cheng replied: Although the various counties in Jiangnan are gradually moving away from the wartime period, the suffering of the people is beyond what those who have not experienced it firsthand can imagine. The focus of this inspection was the freedom of the people. Therefore, in each place, he first checked the places where people were detained. All kinds of malpractices were exposed immediately, like finding things according to a map, with nowhere to hide. Today, the priority for local administration is maintaining public order, and in terms of politics, it is to promote the Five-Power Constitution and establish public opinion organs as soon as possible. The administration of each county must be thoroughly reorganized, and the selection of county magistrates should be strictly reviewed and clarified. He has already filed impeachment requests for the dismissal or punishment of the following officials: Fan Tisheng, Magistrate of Wuxi County; Ding Songcai, Magistrate of Zhenjiang County; Zuo Fei, Chief of the Wuxi County Police Bureau; and Li Depu, Director of Revenue for Wuxi County.

### Discovery of Absurd Notices Instigating Workers to Petition

[Central News Agency Dispatch] Recently, labor unrest has been rampant, often with unnatural developments. According to a reporter's investigation, a certain absurd notice was discovered in the industrial area the day before yesterday, instigating workers to petition and receive money and flour everywhere. The concentration of workers petitioning the municipal government the day before yesterday, and the subsequent destruction of the Fourth District Textile Industry Union yesterday, were all due to workers receiving anonymous notices beforehand and acting accordingly. Yesterday, the General Post Office suddenly received a bizarre phone call stating that all post office branches would go on strike starting tomorrow, causing widespread inquiries at various branches. This phenomenon is clearly the result of planned instigation by unscrupulous villains, seriously affecting social stability and deserving close attention.

### Impersonating Public Officials Leads to Arrests

Wang Guangbi, a native of Haimen who lives at No. 10, Lane 208, Yaozhu Road, and runs a grocery business, was visited by Tan Yingjie, a native of Jiangxi dressed in a Zhongshan suit, carrying a gun, and claiming to be a plainclothes officer from the Investigation and Statistics Bureau, along with six or seven accomplices, who claimed to be ordered to arrest a person surnamed Sheng. Wang immediately reported to the Xujiahui Police Branch, led by Chief Chen, who dispatched judicial section chief Chen Kaizhou and patrol officer Ma Yiqiu with plainclothes officers to the address. They arrested Tan Yingjie on the spot, along with Wang Youqi, Shen Minggan, and Wang Youqi's relative, Chen Baokang (all natives of Haimen), who was cooking in Wang Guangbi's house. A pistol without a permit and nine bullets were found on Tan's person, and five gold rings of unknown origin were found on Wang Youqi's person. All were taken back for questioning. Chief Chen, seeing that the suspects had no identification and no documents proving they were public officials, and were impersonating public officials, prepared a document and sent them to the District Court Prosecutor's Office yesterday for further investigation.

### The High Court's Special Criminal Tribunal Publicly Tried Li Ze Yesterday, Awaiting Further Evidence Before a Retrial is Proposed

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, the High Court's Special Criminal Tribunal at Tilanqiao publicly tried Li Ze. The audience consisted mostly of employees from the New New Company and other department stores, totaling about 200 people. Li Ze's children were also brought by his sister. At 2:30 PM, Li's lawyers Chen Tingrui and Zhang Shizhao arrived together. At 2:45 PM, Judge Liu Yugui, the presiding judge, and Associate Judges Cao Jun and Zhu Zonghai, as well as Prosecutor Dai Yiduo, arrived at the same time. The bailiffs brought Li Ze in. Li had changed into a blue silk cotton robe and looked quite well. His tone was also calm and forceful during his defense.

The Tribunal Examines the Process of Serving in a Puppet Position

After the Prosecutor read the indictment, the judge first asked Li Ze about his involvement with the puppet Merchants' Association. Li replied that the Merchants' Association was a forced puppet organization, with initiators designated by the puppet Ministry of Industry. The directors and supervisors were the initiators, and authority was concentrated in the chairman. He was only nominally a director, never participated in actual work, and only occasionally attended meetings, without expressing any opinions. The transportation allowance he received was 7,000 puppet yuan in the first year, later increased to 8,000 yuan, and finally 15,000 yuan, all of which were distributed to colleagues in the company, as evidenced by public notices. After the testimony, lawyer Chen Tingrui stood up and stated that although the defendant admitted to being a director of the puppet Merchants' Association, it was indeed under duress, as evidenced by documents: (1) a letter from the director of the Ministry of Industry's Hong Kong Office to Li, asking him to serve as an initiator; (2) a letter from Mei Siping, the puppet Minister of Industry, summoning the initiators of the puppet Merchants' Association on March 11, 1943, which also proves that Li's participation in the association was not voluntary. After examining the two letters, the judge asked Li Ze about the sale of over 30,000 catties of steel pipes to the enemy. Li replied that he sold them to the Sen Da Iron Factory, and the subsequent use of the pipes was Sen Da's responsibility.

Reasons for Selling Steel Pipes Are Explained

Lawyer Chen then made two points: (1) Jin Zongcheng introduced the purchase of the steel pipes by Sen Da, and Jin's business card was presented to the court, requesting that he be questioned; (2) the puppet Shanghai District Court replied to an inquiry from the Merchants' Association stating that there were no explicit restrictions on the movement of hardware and steel at that time. Li also stated the reasons for selling the steel pipes: (1) he feared they would be confiscated by the Japanese, so he sold them in advance; (2) the city was frequently bombed, and power outages were common, so he sold the pipes to install generators. Lawyer Chen specifically mentioned two points: (1) New New Company was not the only one selling steel pipes at that time; (2) the hiring of a Japanese advisor had both immediate and long-term reasons. The long-term reason was that in 1937, the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun published a large article stating that New New Company would be sold to the Japanese for 30,000 yuan. New New Company immediately published a rebuttal, so after the Japanese entered the concession, it was even more necessary to hire a Japanese representative to deal with them. Testimony of Plaintiff Shu Yueqiao and Others

Shu Yueqiao was then asked if he had any personal grudges against Li, to which he replied: Absolutely no personal grudges, his accusation was solely for the sake of the nation. He stated how the Merchants' Association's work involved searching for materials and exploiting the people for the enemy, and that the steel pipes were transported away by Japanese military trucks, as witnessed by many. Han Wucheng, Ye Qiubin, and Yao Zhuoren then testified, their statements similar to Shu Yueqiao's. At that point, the matter of the Merchants' Association was temporarily concluded. To ascertain the whereabouts of the steel pipes, the former general affairs director of New New Company and the three representatives of Sen Da Iron Factory, Han Zhiming, Han Zhi, and Chuan Jihe, were summoned, bringing account books to the court. After much examination and questioning, both sides gave similar testimony. The total was 369 bundles and 70 and a half catties of steel pipes, at a price of 5,600 puppet yuan per load, totaling 2,070,348 yuan. The payment was made in three installments.

More Evidence to be Presented Next Time

As the court was about to adjourn, lawyer Chen stated that the defendant's side had more evidence to present next time, which would not only prove that his service in the puppet position was forced, but also that the defendant had done work beneficial to the resistance during the period when the city was occupied. (Note: Li Ze took two letters from his pocket while Shu Yueqiao was testifying and handed them to lawyer Chen. One was a letter from a certain Yuan of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army to Li, and the other was a letter from a certain organization asking him to provide food and supplies when the National Army recovered Shanghai.) The court ordered him to collect the evidence quickly and present it at the next hearing. Li Ze wanted to speak again, but the judge stopped him, instructing him to present it all at the next hearing, and then adjourned.

### Shi Xikun's Accusation is Awaited Awaited for Investigation Before Further Trial

[Our Dispatch] The High Court's Criminal Tribunal tried Shi Xikun yesterday morning, accused of serving as an informant for the enemy consulate in Shanghai, forcing residents in western Shanghai to hang enemy flags, and arresting the patriotic worker Li Wenlong. Associate Judge Cao Jun questioned him, but the defendant denied the charges, stating that he ran a hardware store called Xin Tai Xiang in Shanghai and had always been law-abiding. Witnesses Xu Jianyuan and others testified in court. The court ordered the investigation to continue, and the trial was postponed.

Sentencing Today for Six Traitors

Six cases of traitors will be sentenced this afternoon, including: (1) Fang Zude, driver for the enemy Wusong Military Police; (2) Zhang Jingen, foreman at the enemy Jiading field warehouse; (3) Zou Wenxian, translator for the enemy pacification squad in Baoshan County, and Shi Huiyao, captain of the puppet guard team; (4) Shen Zhangming and Shen Zhaokui, informants for the enemy Showa Island naval unit; (5) Han Shaolin, petty officer third class in the puppet navy; (6) Wang Shiliang, informant for the enemy Pudong Military Police.

Committee Director Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Directors Deputy Commander Li and Director Xuan Tiewu, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai served as reviewing officers. Commander Rong Youlue and Deputy Commander Zhang Jintang personally directed the review. Mayor Qian, wearing a grass-green woolen uniform, inspected the entire field to the sound of military music. The officials were full of spirit. Mayor Qian gave a speech on the spot, first stating that the members were all people with legitimate occupations and considerable education, and that they were worthy of praise for fulfilling their obligations to maintain public order in Shanghai and protect the lives and property of citizens. However, upon joining the corps, they become soldiers and must strictly abide by military discipline, obey the orders of superiors, and complete their mission. The organization of the Defense Corps is to supplement the insufficient strength of the military and police. They must abide by the orders of superiors, serve diligently, and the Defense Corps, as the self-defense force of the people, should stand united with the people and cooperate effectively. Following Qian, Xuan Tiewu and Wang Xiaolai gave speeches, all placing great expectations on the formation of the Defense Corps. Xuan also hoped that all members would step up their service during the New Year season to assist the police in cracking down on bandits.

### Gold Prices Rise Sharply, Breaking Through the Million Mark, Major Players Achieve Squeeze Goal

Yesterday, gold received broad support from large buyers. Actual sales at silver shops were unusually brisk due to exchanges from rural areas. Speculators bought gold to replenish their capital chips due to settlement relationships. Major players in the industry originally intended to squeeze, but with this multi-faceted assistance, they were triumphant. The opening was flat, and initially, it was stable. However, with silver shops continuously collecting to meet demand, prices gradually improved from 965,000. Although there were minor twists and turns along the way, the situation became increasingly favorable. Major players in the industry encouraged from the sidelines, and credit also eased. Small investors were fearless, and eventually, prices broke through the million mark. At this point, there was some profit-taking at high levels, hovering around the million mark for a time. When the million mark was firmly established and not broken, old shorts such as the Northern Gang and Shantou Gang, as well as those pledging securities, were panicked. Squeezing forces, the market price broke away and could not be stopped, and by noon it was approaching 1.05 million. After that, silver shops posted high prices up to 1.15 million, and the gold market presented a squeeze and search for supply simultaneously. In the afternoon, prices broke through 1.1 million again, seeing a new high of 1.15 million, before slightly correcting, falling to 1.08 million. The situation was extremely chaotic, leading to the small market accompanying next-day delivery. The difference between spot transaction buying and selling prices was extremely far, making it difficult to find proper bidding. Until around 4:00 PM, the bidding price was around 1.12 million, an increase of over 150,000 compared to the previous close. Silver shops posted high prices up to 120,000 at noon, later bidding at 180,000. Fine silver was 1,000 yuan, and silver dollars rose to over 650 yuan. Secret discounts eased slightly in the morning but suddenly became more expensive in the afternoon, with daily discounts of 1.2 to 1.5 yuan, and over the New Year's period from 1.5 to 1.8 yuan.

### The Imminent Announcement of New Exchange Rates is Purely a Rumor Fabricated by Speculators, Financial Commissioner Chen Hang Solemnly States

Yesterday, the rumor that the new foreign exchange rate had been decided and was about to be announced spread widely in the city market. The news spread, and the market was quite agitated, with prices for all items rising uniformly and rapidly. Chen Hang, Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance for the Beijing-Shanghai region, solemnly stated to the press that the above rumors were purely fabrications by speculators and were absolutely untrue.

### U.S. Dollars Step Upward, Hong Kong Dollar Selling Prices Pulled Up

U.S. dollars, stimulated by the gold market, continued to rise. The opening price in the morning was 1,480 yuan, and it broke through the 1,500 mark under hedging purchases. At noon, it hovered around 1,550 yuan. With gold prices continuing to jump wildly, it broke through the 1,600 and 1,700 marks again. The hedging price against gold was consistently above 650 yuan per ten taels, peaking at 670 yuan. However, after seeing the high price of 1,700 yuan, many began to sell, and in extreme chaos, it briefly fell back below 1,600. Finally, it hovered around 1,650 yuan, a sharp increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also affected by the gold market and pulled up significantly. Old bills rose by 30 yuan, and new bills also increased by 11 yuan, but these were all selling prices. Bidding was chaotic, and it was difficult to find a match.

### Public Debt Fluctuations Were Numerous, But the Result Was a Higher Close Than Before

Yesterday, most firms dealing with public debt took a holiday, and transaction volume was limited. Class C briefly approached the 2,000 mark in the morning but was suppressed by debt sales to buy gold, falling to 1,800 yuan. After that, it hovered somewhat, struggling slightly around 1,880 yuan at noon. The results at the noon close were as follows compared to the previous close: Class A and B up 240 yuan each, Class C up 180 yuan, Class D up 260 yuan, and Class E up 270 yuan. This was due to seasoned players releasing their holdings, with Class C showing a weaker upward trend.

### Mobile Capital Selects Fertile Ground to Spread: China Phoenix Stocks Rise Immediately Upon Market Opening, Excluding Yung Spinning, All Reach New High Prices

China stocks yesterday inherited the afterglow of the previous close, rising immediately upon market opening. However, major investors conserved their strength, hoping to unleash it within profitable territory. Therefore, the process didn't appear overly tense, and a dip was even observed mid-session. At noon, stimulated by the gold market, buyers came again to pull up prices. Except for Yung Spinning, which was affected by dumping from American-Asian interests and didn't reach high prices, all other stocks closed at high prices. Some mobile capital selected undervalued stocks to acquire, leading to substantial increases in neglected stocks. Those familiar with popular stocks found themselves falling behind. The midday close saw Yung Spinning up by slightly less than 100 yuan from the previous close. American-Asian, with prices lower than Yung Spinning, was sought after, jumping by 220 yuan. The "Three Small Hots" each rose by slightly less than 10%. Neglected stocks rose by 10% to 15%. In the afternoon, small-cap stocks continued to be bid higher.

Foreign stocks yesterday saw buyers bidding up odd-lot shares, which were immediately caught up. The process involved fluctuation. The midday close resulted in Yih Spinning rising by 200 yuan, Wheelock Marden rising by a good 900 yuan, and Steel Union and British Union each rising by 100-200 yuan compared to the previous day. Small-cap stocks such as Yih Brewery, Paper Industry, and Yeh Kwong rose slightly, around 5%.

### Cotton Fabric Thriving

As gold prices repeatedly reach new peaks, the cotton fabric market, influenced by the trend, instills confidence in both factories and merchants. Factories adjust prices tighter, while merchants increase their purchasing efforts. Transactions are rare, but there are reports of dyeing and weaving factories urgently replenishing supplies of unbleached fine cloth, almost indiscriminately, because they need to urgently produce light-colored khaki drill.

### Dyeing and Weaving Industry Subsidies: Sichuan Guild's Silver Tax Subsidy of 2 Jiaos Per Thousand Yuan

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Since the restoration, the Sichuan guild has recovered to its pre-war prosperity, transporting a large quantity of goods, with cotton yarn and cloth being the most prominent. However, there have traditionally been regulations such as silver tax, which impose significant demands. Therefore, after discussion among the dyeing and weaving industry association, it was decided that a fee of 2 jiao per thousand yuan of goods value would be subsidized for the silver tax demanded by the Sichuan guild. As for inspection fees and warehouse fees, since goods are declared and transported by customers, they should be handled by the customers themselves. Notices have been sent to the cotton cloth and yarn industry associations to assist in joint handling.

### Cotton Fabric: Both Sides Observe, Those Holding Goods Demand High Prices

Yesterday, trading of spot cotton was virtually at a standstill, but sentiment continued to be bullish. The spot market for yarn and cloth was closed due to year-end preparations for settling accounts, and the positive news regarding gold prices was rampant. As a result, those holding goods demanded even higher prices. Factories, also, due to several days of work stoppage during the holiday, had no urgent need. They all waited to purchase after reopening. Only Flower brands saw some trading in Zhoupu seed cotton at a price of 9,800 yuan delivered to the warehouse, an increase of another 300 yuan compared to before.

### Large Quantities of Rice Arrive in Shanghai

From Wuhu, transported by the Sanbei Company's Changxing vessel, 10,100 bags of rice arrived at port yesterday morning and were unloaded at the Hongyu Wharf in Pudong. Additionally, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiqing vessel transported 300 bales of tobacco from Qingdao, and the Haisu vessel transported 1,000 bags of flour, 1,000 bags of rice, and 400 chests of tea to Qinhuangdao. These were Tianjin goods, and the buyers picked them up directly from the ship.

### Sugar Recovers

The price of Zhongsha sugar had previously loosened to 36,000-37,000 yuan in off-market trading. However, since only a few followed the price decline to sell, and due to strong rumors regarding Sun Yat-sen banknotes, the price tightened again, now re-entering the 40,000 yuan range.

### Tea Market Trading Quiet

Due to the year's end, tea merchants are eager to handle settlement accounts, so trading is minimal. Occasional transactions occur, mostly between small retailers and local shops. Regarding prices, those holding goods are unwilling to liquidate excessively. Tianjin, Yingkou, and other places still have demand for various types of green tea, but activity will likely resume after the Lunar New Year.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Western medicines rise along with gold prices, with the increases being quite substantial. This is especially true for saccharin and quinine. For other items such as Bayer products, the price appears stable, as the Bayer Pharmaceuticals Liquidation Office continues to distribute goods.

Lime prices... (missing data) Brick prices rose over 10,000 yuan per ten thousand bricks, and lime prices rose 200-300 yuan per load.

Longans are becoming less common, while sellers are collecting more goods, so the price is slightly tighter. Yesterday's market rose 1,000 yuan to 500 yuan.

Yesterday's market for knitted goods saw prices rise in response to the gold price stimulus, and those holding goods were generally unwilling to sell. Those wanting to buy could not find them anywhere.

### Export Goods Secured with Loans: Bank of China Has Extended 300 Million in Export Loans

### Vice Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education Discusses Three Key Points of Rehabilitation Work: Plan to Rehabilitate Schools that Moved Inland, Prepare to Restore Universities that Were Shut Down, and Implement Planned School Establishment

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Zhu Jingnong, Political Vice Minister of Education, came to Beijing on official business on the 26th. Our reporter stationed in Beijing visited him. After an eight-year absence, we were surprised at how much he had aged. During our conversation, we learned that the Ministry of Education reported three points regarding the rehabilitation work of various schools:

School Restoration Around the Summer Break

(1) All universities and colleges that moved inland will strive to move back to their respective locations for restoration. However, due to factors such as distance, school buildings, and transportation costs, the restoration period will vary. It is expected that it will be completed around the summer break. Secondary schools in various localities, which were taken over by the national government for wartime relief, will naturally be returned to the management of the local governments after rehabilitation.

Restoring Universities that Were Shut Down

(2) The universities that were shut down during the War of Resistance are now preparing for restoration, including universities and the rehabilitation of Beijing Normal University, Beiyang Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Business School, all of which are in separate preparation plans. (3) Promoting new planned education. The Ministry of Education's first five-year implementation plan for education, formulated during the War of Resistance, has already been implemented in the interior for the national education stage.

Promoting National Education

Currently, promotion is also being urged in the recovered areas. Provinces and cities in the interior that have already implemented the first plan will continue with the second five-year plan starting from January of this year. Those that have not yet implemented it, such as the newly recovered Taiwan, will create the first five-year plan for implementation, in order to achieve the goal of establishing a central national school in every township, a national school in every bao (a local administrative unit), and implementing six years of compulsory education in primary schools. Regarding the promotion of education at all levels after the war, in addition to national education, which has been successfully implemented in the interior, the recovered areas will follow suit and move quickly to catch up. Gradual implementation plans will also be formulated for secondary education, higher education, and social education.

Such as Opening an Education Conference

It is heard that a national education conference will be convened this year to discuss many important issues in education. It is also heard that Vice Minister Hang Liwu plans to go to Chongqing on official business in early February. During Vice Minister Hang's absence from Beijing, Vice Minister Zhu will work in Beijing. Vice Minister Hang will return before Vice Minister Zhu goes.

### The Beginning of the Year

— Editor

"A year's plan starts in spring" is a very old saying, but at the beginning of each year, we always use this sentence to remind and encourage ourselves.

In general families, things get very busy when the Spring Festival arrives. However, very few people can calmly discuss the year's plans at this time. In fact, determining the year's plan is more important than socializing.

The Spring Festival is the beginning of the first lunar month. Usually, we have already switched to using the Gregorian calendar and no longer need to use the lunar calendar. However, due to farming, we still have places where we use the lunar calendar. Therefore, in certain contexts, it is called the agricultural calendar.

Speaking of the agricultural calendar, it makes us think of cultivation. If we want to have a prosperous harvest, we must first ask ourselves if we have worked hard to complete our cultivation work. Farmers will be busy this spring. Everyone in our family should also set their specific plans this spring.

We should not only seek temporary happiness or temporary busyness; we should seek constant happiness and constant busyness. Constant effort.

Education

### Is Your Child Naughty?

— Feng

Speaking of children, mothers often shake their heads helplessly and say, "That one in our family is simply hopeless. He's naughty all day long. As soon as you let go of something, he'll take it apart for you. He's endlessly unreasonable... Scolding is useless, it's like the wind in his ears. The adults are mad at him, but he still goes off to be unreasonable again."

Yes, children are quite disobedient. They want to be naughty and don't understand whether they're bothering the adults. When they hold something in their hands, as long as it's fun, they don't care if it's important to you or not. When the interest comes, they only know to keep playing, and they don't understand that this causes "destruction." This kind of play is bound to cause the adults to hit and scold. In fact, mothers, take a calm look and see if this isn't an expression of exploring knowledge!

Undoubtedly, children are rarely seen and isolated in their knowledge. Anything they see for the first time is sacred and novel. They want to understand why it's made up of such a shape and substance. They want to understand where the novelty lies. Therefore, the way they explore these questions, in the eyes of adults, is often thought of as a kind of "destruction." Most psychologists advocate that if a child can take apart a watch, it's best to give him a second one, and don't hit or scold him, because that would stop his curiosity. Everyone agrees that only the urging of curiosity can lead to further understanding, and his talent can be fully developed. The expression of a child's talent is even more unreserved when he's being naughty.

Children not only love to be naughty, but also love to meddle in things. They often ask inexplicable questions about a certain thing or a certain item. But mothers sometimes ignore them or give them a fantastic and absurd answer. This kind of indifferent attitude is the worst thing you can do to a child, especially to children aged four or five to teens whose knowledge is just beginning to open up.

Children not only need to understand, but also need to understand correctly, so that they have a basic concept. Don't think that once children enter school, all the responsibility for education is handed over to the teachers at school. Honestly, what they read in books and what the teachers teach them is not necessarily their biggest question, let alone their biggest interest. And what they most want answered are often some small things that adults think are trivial, or what they think are inexplicable nonsense. For example, they ask: How many stars are there in the sky? What is sugarcane made of? Why don't we have a snowfall in the summer so we can make some ice cream?

Their questions are the most eager expression of education. They remember what you answer the most, and the impression is the deepest. If you are impatient or give them an absurd answer without thinking, they will believe it completely without any doubt. If you reject them, they may never bring up the question again. A casual interest, once gone, is not easily returned. As for harshly stopping their questions with stern words, that is equivalent to prohibiting them from seeking knowledge. Parents should have a correct and interesting answer to their children's questions, and generously apply some fertilizer along with their imagination. The purpose of adding fertilizer is to correctly develop their talents.

### A Happy Spirit

— Xu Baiyi

To make family life beautiful and happy, we must first possess a happy spirit. This happy spirit can be generated from accurate viewpoints and optimistic attitudes. We must first possess this accurate viewpoint, and then start from nearby, step by step, and then our ideal can become reality, and at the same time, a smile will appear on our faces.

With a happy spirit, we will have a kind of cordial feeling when we treat people, and there will be no hypocritical dignity. So that when anyone sees us, it is as if they have seen their closest friend.

Due to this kind of happy spirit, a valuable demeanor can be produced. By interacting with people with this demeanor, one can achieve the state of "all within the four seas are brothers."

Germany has several famous philosophers: Kant was a hesitant figure, Schopenhauer was a misogynistic bachelor, and Nietzsche was also a psychologically conflicted person. They did not have a happy spirit, so their actions were perverse, their thoughts could not meet the needs of the general public, and they could not live a normal life.

So from now on, let us generate a happy spirit to lay the foundation for building a modern family.

Occupation

### The First Day in the Ward

— Xiao Chuang

Even after being admitted to nursing school, one still has to go through a month and a half of probation. This period is entirely devoted to lectures and has no contact with the hospital. Even our uniforms are just a blue cloth smock and white caps and white shoes. During this period, we lived all day in two large classrooms in the basement. One classroom was full of skeletons, eyeballs, big ears, and other toy-like specimens and models, with various human body charts hanging on the walls. This is where we listened to lectures. The other room was a practice room, decorated like a ward, with white beds, white sheets, white cabinets, and white screens. Everything was white, plus two oilcloth patients lying there, at least two sizes larger than ourselves, because they were shipped from abroad, with yellow hair and blue eyes. They were used for practice, such as washing their faces, feeding them, giving enemas, etc. Once, we were having a Chinese class in there. The new teacher shook his head and softly recited a Tang poem, and gently asked, "Will it disturb them!" We said, "No." He seemed to suddenly understand and said, "Oh, they are foreigners."

Six weeks passed, and we had only one-third of the students left. Some were in poor health, some couldn't keep up with the coursework, and a few quit halfway due to lack of courage. On the first morning of the seventh week, we changed into our new blue shirt and white skirt uniforms, went through a solemn graduation ceremony, and were led into different wards by supervising staff in groups. Our group consisted of four people. The ward was so clean, bright, and the air was solemn and quiet, with only the sound of running water, steam pots, and the clanging of porcelain basins when the utility room door was opened. Doctors and nurses were busily working like shuttles, but they were very calm and orderly. Our four new uniforms became the focus of their attention today, and the patients also opened their eyes to watch and whisper to each other. Especially the starched aprons, which rustled loudly as we walked, were even more restrictive, making it difficult to move. Perhaps because we were in an unfamiliar place, the ward seemed too wide and too open, with no place to hide. Two of us were naturally more "lively," and quickly mixed into the old team, while Cao and I were cautiously sticking together.

The red light came on, meaning a patient was calling. We looked at each other and ran towards the patient together. No one spoke, and the patient said, "No water." She held up the kettle, and I took the tray. When we got to the kitchen door, we remembered that patients' tableware could not be brought into the kitchen, so we backed away again, put down the kettle and tray, and found a large water container in the kitchen. One carried it, and the other followed. The patient next door called "Doctor." We both turned our heads back, and he said his pillow was uncomfortable. Cao raised his head and pulled the pillow down slightly. I saw bloodstains on the bandage under his neck, so I didn't dare to touch it. Cao was sent away by the supervisor. A patient by the balcony wanted to have a bowel movement. I went to get a bedpan, covered it with a piece of cloth, and set off from the utility room, which was quite a distance. Under the gaze of many eyes, I didn't know whether to hold it with both hands or carry it with one hand. The skirt rustled loudly, the hat seemed to fall, my knee joints stiffened, and then softened. I thought I was going to faint. I also tried my best to avoid the doctors, afraid that I wouldn't understand the terms they used, or that I wouldn't know what they were asking for.

Finally, the supervisor came. She took me to a single-person ward with a red sign on the door, meaning "isolation." I immediately held my breath and waited until I put on the mask. She helped me put on the isolation gown and said that this was a typhoid patient who was in critical condition, and asked me to do interval care for him. I tiptoed over and first took a look at him. His face was full of beard, his eyes were sunken, his eyebrows were tightly locked, he was abnormally thin, his mouth was slightly open, phlegm was stuck in his throat, and his breathing was very rough. I took off my watch, wrapped it in paper, and placed it on the windowsill nearby. While working, I memorized the unfamiliar work procedures and had to pay attention to the complicated isolation procedures, often hesitating and often forgetting. I was fortunate that this was a patient who was not very conscious and had no reaction, just like the dummy in the classroom, only heavier. I laboriously finished bathing him and changed the sheets. The kitchen sent a bowl of chicken soup. I reluctantly spooned two spoonfuls into him. The third time, the chicken soup flowed from the corner of his mouth, and he stopped swallowing. I wiped his mouth and tucked in the sheets. He slept more quietly than before, relaxed his eyebrows, and there was no more phlegm.

A nurse came with a tray to wash his eyes. She went out without putting down the tray. Then a group of doctors and a suction machine came in. They put one end of the tube into the patient's mouth, and the machine whirred. A fat foreign doctor made a stop gesture, and the room was suddenly silent. A young doctor by the bed lifted the patient's buttocks, a pool of blood. They said some foreign words in a low voice that I couldn't understand and went out. I seemed to hear "bleeding"... "bath"... "student." The last one turned back and glared at me.

I stood blankly not far from the door. It seemed like a long, long time before the supervisor came and said, "What do you want?" Her voice was very gentle, almost making me cry. "There's still a watch." "A watch?" "Inside," I pointed to the small room. She understood, smiled, ran in, and very casually took my watch from the windowsill next to the dead man's head. I was taken out of the ward and had a cup of hot coffee in her office. "Go off work," she still said gently. Not understanding, she said, "Time's up."

I knew the time was not up, but I quickly ran back to the dormitory and took several baths in a row. That night, I felt feverish and uncomfortable all over. I saw a face full of beard, a pool of blood. I heard "student"... "bath"... "bleeding"....

### Excellent Sayings for Managing a Family

Raising a child and turning them into a caged bird is not the way to educate a child. - Ren

To nurture one's children with respect, thrift, impartiality, and consistency is the way of a virtuous mother. - Ouyang Xiu

The decline of a family cannot be separated from extravagance; the ruin of a person cannot be separated from idleness; being disliked cannot be separated from arrogance. - Zeng Guofan

Keeping detailed accounts is also a disease. Servants colluding for illicit gain and descendants becoming suspicious of each other often stem from this. - Wen's Motherly Instructions

Ancestors are to be valued for their achievements in poetry and books. Descendants who enjoy wealth and honor despise poetry and books. Ancestors' family businesses come from diligence and thrift. Descendants who inherit the family business forget diligence and thrift. This is why so many families decline. - Zhang Shangjing

International

### Women in the Soviet Union

— Yang Huijuan

Ms. Pearl Binder, an American, has lived in Russia for many years and has a deep understanding of Russian women. She has written many books about Russian customs and sentiments, all of which have been praised. The following is a detailed description of her view on the lives of Russian women.

The status of Russian women is equal to that of men, because their work and life are not entirely limited to the family. In the past few years, although the Soviet Union vigorously encouraged childbirth due to population needs, the duties of women have never been confined to the family. In addition to managing the family, women also engage in social work, hold government positions, participate in various industries, and work as musicians, painters, architects, engineers, etc. Women participate in everything, and men talk to women about everything. A famous saying of Lenin is popular in Moscow: "Every cook must know how to rule Russia."

It seems impossible for women to have so many things to do in the family and at the same time hold outside jobs. There are several reasons why Russian women can do this. First, household affairs have become very simple with scientific evolution; second, social work has become very rationalized due to proper arrangements. Women work outside for a very short time. There are rest periods at noon, and they only work until four o'clock in the afternoon. Every sixth day, there is a day off. Even if there are many chores at home, they can be taken care of calmly.

At the same time, housework is also very simple: furniture is only a few simple pieces, which can be swept clean in a few minutes; every house has public gas, making cooking very convenient; groceries are pre-packaged. If you don't want to cook, you can buy ready-made dishes, carry them back in a three-layer pot. Usually, everyone eats in the public dining hall. Children are taken care of by nurseries, so adults don't have to worry about them all the time. If the housework is really too busy, you can hire a helper. This kind of helper is called a "domestic worker" (Domestice Worker). They don't wear uniforms, just wear an apron. Their educational level is relatively low, so while they work for you, you also have the obligation to teach them to read.

Some people think that children in such socialized families will not be taken care of properly, and that families will lose a lot of fun. In fact, this view is not very correct. There are no drawbacks to children being cared for by nurseries, because those engaged in this social work have twenty-five years of history. Because many heavy and unnecessary tasks have been eliminated, women can use their spare time to engage in various more meaningful entertainment and self-cultivation. The food in the public dining hall is also very delicious, and eating is not limited to the dining hall. Usually, breakfast is always at home, and afternoon tea is also prepared at home.

Even if women go out to work, it varies from person to person and is not forced. Guiding women to serve the public is also a matter of measuring their talents and providing facilities, using a gradual approach. For example, some women don't like to leave their families. She likes cooking, and her cooking skills are very good, so she can be allowed to cook more dishes and taught to serve in public canteens. Some women don't like to leave home. She prefers to take care of children, and she has a special love for children, so she can be allowed to take care of more children and taught to work in nurseries.

Some people also think that women going out to work will infringe on men's "territory" and will be resented by men. But in the Soviet Union, this phenomenon does not exist. Men have plenty of work and plenty of professions for them to do, so they don't have to worry about women taking their business away. At the same time, they can clearly understand that there is still much work in society that needs women to cooperate with them.

Have Soviet women become rough and vulgar and lost their feminine beauty because they work outside? (Indeed, many people may worry about this when talking about women working outside.) Soviet women still maintain their feminine beauty and maintain their feminine charm, but they do not regard beauty as a woman's only task. The lives of Soviet women are extensive and active, because their lives are not limited to the family.

### The True Meaning of Family

— Fei Wen

A family is a group formed by emotions, where parents love each other and love their children, extending to every member of the family; at the same time, they promote and enhance true love, so that the young can obtain security and guidance.

In the family, we can enjoy quiet and life, obtain a sense of peace and joy, and engage in proper recreation by ourselves or with others; we can preserve our private property and dispose of it in accordance with our individual styles; and cultivate all the beautiful habits, language, and character to pass on to our children. In the family, we can also produce human mutual love, loyalty, honesty, and other good character traits.

So a family can really be said to be a paradise, a holy land, and a source that inspires our souls.

Toys

### Homemade Small Toys

— Xiao Shufang

Last issue I talked about how to make a small pug. Today I will introduce how to make a half-length cloth doll bag.

The half-length cloth doll bag is similar to the kind of cloth doll we used to see that held sweets. It can not only hold sweets, but also be used as decoration for children to play with. You can make it with leftover scraps of material.

To make a half-length cloth doll bag, follow the diagram on the left, determine the size of the cloth, follow the dotted lines to sew the body and bottom together to form a cylinder, leave an opening in the back, make it hollow in the middle, and then sew the face (using white cloth) according to the dotted lines, stuff it with cotton (the side of the face that is exposed should be flat), sew the bottom end tight, then sew the hat on the head and sew it tightly to the body (make the cape and body as a sandwich), sew the arms together, stuff them with cotton, and then place them as shown in the diagram (lower left). Draw on the features, tie a ribbon around the neck, then tie a silk rope to the end of the hat, and you can hang it on the dressing table or on a small bed. It can hold cotton gauze, sweets, etc., which is much better-looking than an ordinary pocket.

If you have lace, embroider some edges around the clothes of the small cloth doll, which will be even more beautiful.

### Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Song

— Ba Ling

I think that the folk songs circulating in Chinese society have indelible value. The following one fully exposes the irrationality of traditional Chinese families and the need for transformation:

"Rose blooms every month, the mother-in-law scolds the daughter-in-law as a dead slave. Good food and clothing are not to be had, beating and scolding come from time to time. The slave did not run in from the front door, but slipped in from the back door. The family asked the matchmaker to get me, the family asked the matchmaker to get me. Four people carried the fancy sedan chair, the flag bearers and umbrella holders set off cannons. The eldest brother carried me into the sedan chair, and the younger brother sent me to the City God Temple. Today it is so indifferent, back then it was so lively!"

In this folk song, we can see the disharmony between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in Chinese families. We certainly cannot say that the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in general families is like fire and water, but in most families, conflicts between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law can occur at any time.

How can we reduce friction and maintain affection between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law? Only by starting from "mutual understanding." If both parties can "forgive each other," then naturally they will not "nitpick" with each other, leading to "arguing back"!
