### Heated Discussion on the Draft Constitution; Sun Ke States Amendments Can Be Accommodated

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] The Political Consultative Conference, held since the 10th, has convened nine times as of the 19th. The five categories of issues slated for discussion have now been fully deliberated. The conference will adjourn for one day tomorrow, Sunday. The tenth meeting will be scheduled after the subcommittees have completed their consultations.

[Further Dispatch] The Policy Guidelines Group of the Consultative Conference's subcommittee convened a meeting at the Supreme National Defense Council at 3 PM today.

[United Press, Chongqing, 19th] Various subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference are currently immersed in studying various issues, the most important of which are: (1) the reorganization and nationalization of the army, with the Communist Party demanding that this be carried out simultaneously with the government's demobilization plan; (2) the formation of a State Council, with the number of members limited to one-third; (3) the issue of convening the National Assembly in Nanjing on May 5th; (4) the constitutional issue, with the Communist Party demanding the adoption of a cabinet system along the lines of the American and British models.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] The ninth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference was held at 9 AM on the 19th to discuss the draft constitution. First, government representative Sun Ke explained the content and spirit of the May 5th Draft Constitution. Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Fu Sinian, Hu Lin, Zeng Qi, Yang Yongjun, Zhang Shenfu, Wu Yuzhang, Li Zhuchen, and others then spoke in succession. The meeting was chaired by Sun Ke, with Secretary-General Lei reporting the attendance of 32 members including Yu Jiaju, et al. Member Sun Ke, in his capacity as a government representative, explained the May 5th Draft Constitution, elaborating on (1) political power and governing power, (2) the National Assembly, (3) the five-yuan system, (4) the presidential system, (5) the local system, and (6) the rights and freedoms of the people, point by point. Sun stated that amendments to the draft constitution would be accommodated. (Sun Ke's original statement will be continued on the third page tomorrow.)

Huang Yanpei, based on his experience in participating in the Constitutional Government Preparatory Committee and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association, believed that the May 5th Draft Constitution needed to be re-examined. He stated that the review of the draft constitution should be approached with a calm, absolutely objective, and forward-looking attitude. He then summarized the opinions of various parties on the content of the draft constitution and listed issues that should be considered, such as: (1) legal restrictions on the rights of the people, (2) specific provisions for gender equality, (3) a three-yuan system, (4) the powers of the president and the issue of the vice president and premier, (5) the popular election of provincial governors. He agreed with Hu Lin's proposal to establish a constitutional drafting committee and hire experts for detailed study.

Shen Junru then spoke, emphasizing the issue of local political power. He detailed his participation in the drafting of the Temple of Heaven Constitution in the past, and his proposals on the issue of the local system at that time, and finally mentioned the tenth item of the Minutes of the Talks between the Government and the CCP Representatives, "On the Issue of Liberating Local Governments." He stated that it should be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for discussion and believed that the "historical contribution to the War of Resistance" and the "political progressiveness" of the CCP areas should be recognized. The content of the draft constitution should be left to group discussion.

### Propose the Establishment of a Review Committee; The Five-Yuan System and the Status of Provinces Should Be Considered

Fu Sinian said: The May 5th Draft Constitution was drafted based on the essence of the five-power constitution. Since this constitution is a constitution based on the Three Principles of the People, it should reflect the thoroughness of the Three Principles of the People, but its content does not have special provisions for the exercise of civil rights and the problems of various ethnic minorities in the country. Regarding the National Assembly issue, he believed that this system needs to be amended due to changes in the times. He suggested that if the five-yuan system is still adopted, the Legislative Yuan can be used as the lower house and the Control Yuan as the upper house, using the parliamentary powers of the bicameral system of various countries. The names of the two houses can remain the same, but the powers can be expanded. There is no need to have the name of a parliament, but there is the reality of a parliament. A part of the legislators are elected by the National Assembly, and most are directly elected by the people, and the supervisors are elected by the provincial assemblies. In this way, the principles of the five-power constitution can be accepted on the one hand, and the bicameral parliamentary system can be implemented on the other hand. Fu also believed that the provinces should be adjusted, but opposed provincial autonomy.

Hu Lin said: Not only do the Chinese people not oppose the Three Principles of the People, but scholars around the world cannot think it is wrong, but the rules for its application should be considered. We respect the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, but there is no need to stick to the form. Hu also said: There are many places in the May 5th Draft Constitution that can be discussed. For example, the National Assembly issue should be established by us, and it is necessary to consider it carefully, because its powers can be exercised by the Legislative Yuan, so why this huge institutional form. For the rights of initiative and referendum, he reiterated yesterday's suggestion that the Political Consultative Conference or the government should establish a constitutional draft review committee to study it, the number of people should not be too large, and it should be completed within three or four months.

Zeng Qi said: The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, so it has its dignity. He advocated organizing a constitutional draft review committee. He believes that the nature of the constitution should be flexible, and a cabinet system should be adopted. The two-house and five-yuan systems can only preserve their spirit, and there is no need to stick to the form. The provincial system should adopt the principle of balanced power and determine the autonomous status of the provinces.

Yang Yongjun made his first speech today, saying that local governments should be more important than the central government, and autonomy should be dedicated to administration. He also emphasized that the province should be the highest autonomous unit, with provincial governors elected by the people, and that the balanced power system between the central government and the province should be determined.

Zhang Shenfu put forward three principles: (1) The draft constitution must be revised to be in line with national conditions, national history, and world trends. (2) Not only should the present be taken into account, but the future should also be opened up. (3) The rights of the people should not be restricted, and they should be given free opportunities.

Wu Yuzhang said: The fundamental policy of the constitution should be based on the principle of building the country on the Three Principles of the People, and adapt to world trends and the situation in China. This is everyone's hope. The great spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen should also be well incorporated into the constitution. He then put forward the following principles: (1) To protect the rights of the people, ordinary laws should not be used to restrict them. (2) Regarding the powers of the central and local governments, adopt Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of balanced power. The five-yuan system divides power, which is almost equal to no power, resulting in too much presidential power. Wu also said: The most democratic countries in the world are Britain and the United States. We can adopt the parliamentary system of Britain and the United States in the future, but we must refer to the actual situation in our country. (3) On the issue of local autonomy, the province is the autonomous unit, and the provincial governor is elected by the people. According to Dr. Sun's teachings, the provincial constitution should be established to allow local areas to develop freely. (4) Determine national policy and stipulate in the constitution that military affairs should adopt a democratic spirit, not a militaristic spirit, so that the military serves the people. Culture and economic aspects should be allowed to develop freely without restrictions. Li Zhuchen said: In the draft constitution, the issue of equalizing land ownership and restricting capital should prioritize the former and then the latter. Li also specifically pointed out that the slogan of attaching importance to national capital and national industry should be emphasized. The chairman then proposed that, as suggested by Zhang Lisheng yesterday, one person should be elected by each party to make a general review of the topics of the past few days. It was decided to raise it after consultation by each group, and the meeting was adjourned temporarily.

### Communist Troops Besiege Yanzhou, Forcing the Garrison to Surrender

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 19th] The commander of the Communist troops besieging Yanzhou on the Jinpu Railway, Ye Fei, commander of the Second Column of the New Fourth Army, sent an ultimatum on the 13th, jointly signed by him, Communist Party Political Commissar Lai Chuanzhu, and Deputy Political Commissar Tan Shilong, forcing the defending troops to surrender to the Communist troops. Deputy Commander Li Yannian has telegraphed the Military Commission, asking it to inform the Communist Party负责人 of this absurd situation of the Communist troops and to correct it immediately.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] Jinzhou News, since the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist troops have intensified their attacks on the National Army in the Northeast. Such acts of treachery are truly intolerable. According to reports from various sources: (1) The Fourth Detachment of our troops stationed in Jianchang Baoan at Dachuan was surrounded by Communist troops, and more than a thousand people were added on the 16th to launch a fierce siege, attempting to destroy the troops and occupy the area. (2) The road protection troops stationed dozens of kilometers southwest of Paozi Zhangwu were attacked by a brigade of the 3rd Division of the Communist troops, numbering about a thousand people, on the 15th, and the railway was destroyed. (3) The Communist troops in Haicheng attacked our Zhao troops' Liu Division on the 13th and 14th, and destroyed the railway near Panshan and Dahushan on the 14th, and destroyed the railway bridges north of Panshan. In addition, the Fengjiakou Railway, 15 kilometers from Cangxian on the Jinpu Line, was destroyed by the Communist troops for 8,000 meters, and southbound vehicles can no longer reach Cangxian.

### Weng Wenhao to Go to Nanjing Tomorrow

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The National Highway Conference is scheduled to open in Nanjing on the 20th. In addition, Weng Wenhao, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and Qian Changzhao, Vice Chairman of the Resources Committee, are scheduled to come to Nanjing on the 21st.

### Veteran Employees Aged Sixty and Over Granted Temporary Postponement of Retirement

Ministry of Communications Orders Both the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Vietnam Railways

[This Newspaper, Kunming, 18th] The Ministry of Communications previously ordered employees of all directly affiliated railways who were over sixty years of age to voluntarily apply for retirement. Recently, in order to meet the needs of the recovered areas during the repatriation period, it specifically telegraphed the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Bureaus yesterday, approving all employees over sixty years of age to postpone retirement for five years.

### Over Ten Thousand Unemployed Workers in the Boshan and Zichuan Coal Mining Areas; The Extent of Damage to Mining Equipment is Alarming

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] According to a certain mining industrialist who recently came to Nanjing from Qingdao: After the announcement of the ceasefire order, the results of the Communist troops' destruction of the coal mines on the Jiaoji and Jinpu railways are roughly as follows: (1) Most of the mining machines and electrical equipment in the Boshan mining area and Zichuan mining area on the Zhangbo branch line of the Jiaoji Railway have been destroyed by the Communist troops, and a small number have been transported to Guan Water in southern Shandong to hide. There are more than 10,000 unemployed workers, resulting in a serious coal shortage in Qingdao, which is the most convenient place to obtain coal. (2) The mining area belonging to Taixian on the Jinpu Line, the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mine on the Linzao branch line, and the Jiawang District Mine, most of their mine equipment has been destroyed, and thousands of workers have been killed or injured. Zhongxing Company has about 250,000 tons of coal in storage, which is currently impossible to transport out. The coal stored by Zhongxing in Lianyungang is now being transported to Qingdao. If the mining areas along the Pinghan and Pingsui railways destroyed by the Communist troops are included, the extent of the damage is truly appalling. Fortunately, the Jingxing Coal Mine in Jin Province has been taken over and reorganized by the government, and the output of the Kailuan Coal Mine is increasing day by day, and it can now produce 10,000 tons of coal per day, which is enough to maintain the status quo in the transportation to Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai. The minimum monthly coal consumption along the Beijing-Shanghai line before the war was about 240,000 tons. After the war, most factories have not resumed work, and only 120,000 tons are transported each month. With the addition of the coal that the Huainan Coal Mine may supply, the difficulty of coal use in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places is expected to gradually decrease. Although the result of the Communist troops' current destruction of roads and mines is enough to hinder the government's repatriation plan for a while, it has unknowingly ruined the national strength and caused untold suffering to the people.

### Anecdotes from the Political Consultative Conference

— Zhao Haosheng

From the gate of the National Government to the venue, there are four lines of guards, who are dignified and respectful.

The lounge is comfortably furnished with sofas, braziers, black tea, and many attendants. Attendees' clothes, hats, canes, etc. are taken by them upon entering and sent to the cloakroom.

The "Press Pass" for news reporters is moon white. One side has a photo and the other side has notes: (1) This pass is only for the use of the holder within the specified time, (2) The holder of this pass must not carry weapons, canes, or any other items. (3) If this pass is lost, please notify this office immediately. (4) The holder of this pass must sit in the designated seat and must not move around at will. The "Press Pass" for journalists is Special Number 7.

The Secretariat has produced a "Political Consultative Conference Car Pass" with a red plum blossom pattern. Cars with this pass can drive directly into the gate of the National Government. The reporter did not know this trick on the first day, so he was politely stopped by the guards.

The seven representatives of the Chinese Communist Party: Zhou Enlai is handsome and elegant, holding a green deerskin women's handbag; Wang Ruofei is plump in his Zhongshan suit and woolen coat; Ye Jianying is neat in his military uniform; Lu Dingyi is radiant; Deng Yingchao wears a floral scarf and smiles often; Dong Biwu wears a gray satin robe, which is elegant and generous; Wu Yuzhang wears a leather-collared coat and is energetic. The seven representatives come and go in two cars. A certain attendee joked: They don't look like proletarians at all.

Liang Shuming, a representative of the Democratic League, participated in the out-of-meeting consultation of the Five-Person Group and decided on the agenda, but his speeches on all occasions raised matters outside the agenda. The philosopher is so forgetful.

Zhang Bojun initially wore a tweed Zhongshan suit, changed to a fox fur robe the next day, added a top hat on the third day, and added a cane on the fourth day. The small "props" of the representative are being added every day.

Luo Longji has a hoarse voice. At the fifth meeting, he said "25% tax increase" instead of "25% rent reduction." The professor of political science seems to be less familiar with economic issues.

The four representatives and one secretary of the Youth Party all wear long robes, and Zeng Qi wears a black fleece cap to the meeting.

Zhang Dongsun often walks around in the venue, passing notes, and his pace is as tense as an elementary school student doing gymnastics.

### Marshall Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing; Important Discussions with President Song Before Departure; The Purpose of His Visit to Shanghai and the Trip to Beiping Have Not Been Announced

[This Newspaper Report] U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall flew to this area from Chongqing yesterday afternoon. This visit to Shanghai by Marshall was not preceded by any notification here, so very few people knew about it. Our officials only received news of Marshall's arrival in Shanghai last night. The purpose of Marshall's trip has also not been announced. According to the United Press, Marshall met with General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. China Theater, at Wedemeyer's private residence last night. It is also learned that Marshall met with President Song Ziwen for discussions a few hours before leaving Chongqing. All sectors of the city are paying close attention to Marshall's whereabouts. When General Wedemeyer hosted reporters yesterday morning, the reporters asked whether Marshall was prepared to come to Shanghai. At that time, Wedemeyer replied that he had not heard anything about Marshall's whereabouts. This morning, when the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters hosted reporters, the reporters also asked the U.S. representative Robinson whether Marshall had any plans to go to Beiping. Robinson replied that he did not know whether Marshall had any plans to go to Beiping. This newspaper's reporter inquired with all relevant parties last night, but no one was able to reveal the purpose of Marshall's visit to Shanghai or whether he would go to Beiping. Last night, the United Press reported that Marshall would host reporters at the Cathay Hotel this morning. This newspaper's reporter was also unable to officially confirm this point.

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 19th, broadcast: It is heard that Marshall may go to Beiping to preside over the work of the Mediation Executive Headquarters after a stay of one or two days in Shanghai. Zhou Enlai also said that Marshal Marshall has agreed to serve as a consultant to the Reorganization Committee.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] U.S. Special Envoy to China General Marshall flew from Chongqing to Shanghai by special plane at 3:30 p.m. yesterday and landed at Jiangwan Airport. General Wedemeyer, Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Commander Zhang Xuezhong, Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo, and other Chinese and American military and political leaders all went to the airport to welcome him. After getting off the plane, Marshall shook hands with each of the welcomers, and then boarded a car with General Wedemeyer and drove to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest. The military police were on strict alert along the way. It is also learned that in addition to convening senior American generals to hear reports today, Marshall will also attend a tea party to comfort the Allied forces and will hold a press conference at the invitation of Wedemeyer in the near future.

[United Press, Beiping, 19th] Nine members of the U.S. Congress arrived in Qingdao today and will go to Shanghai in a few days. It is believed that these nine people are all members of the Naval Affairs Committee. They arrived in Qingdao by plane from Japan and will visit Tianjin and be guests of the U.S. Marines there. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robinson said that their visit to North China has nothing to do with the work of the Mediation Executive Headquarters.

### Rumor of India Banning Large Denomination Rupees; Yunnan Financial Circles in Turmoil

[This Newspaper, Kunming, 18th] In recent years, a large number of Indian rupees have flowed into Yunnan Province, and denominations of 100, 500, 1,000, and 10,000 rupees account for the majority. Kunming City has recently heard that the Indian central government has banned large denomination rupees, causing extreme fear among people in financial circles, and the financial market is almost in chaos. The provincial and municipal chambers of commerce have held special consultations on countermeasures, in addition to sending personnel to the British Consulate in Yunnan to inquire about the facts, and also asking our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay attention to negotiations, hoping that the ban will not affect the huge amount of rupees overseas. Regarding the content of the ban, it is understood as follows: On the 12th, the Indian central government passed a bill prohibiting the circulation of 500, 1,000, and 10,000 rupee banknotes from now on. Banks and public treasuries holding these banknotes should exchange them for 100 rupee banknotes at the United Reserve Bank before 3:00 p.m. this Saturday. Ordinary people holding these banknotes with a total amount of less than one million rupees should apply to any bank or public treasury for the exchange of lower denomination banknotes within ten days. The application form should state the name, occupation, address, and the income tax area to which they belong, as well as the reasons for owning the banknotes, so that the government can send personnel to investigate. If the holder cannot go to the bank or public treasury in person due to circumstances, they can send an insured letter to the United Reserve Bank in Mumbai, Kolkata, and Madras within 14 days to apply. For applications to exchange amounts above one million rupees, an application must be made to the United Reserve Bank in these three places. Those who make false reports will be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years or fined. It is heard that the main purpose of the Indian government's move is to crack down on the black market and strictly prevent speculative capital. It has not been stated whether this ban applies to foreign countries.

### Mediation Department Continues to Dispatch Three Groups; To Go to Xuzhou and Datong Respectively; Establish a Joint Staff Department to Enforce Orders

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Xuzhou News: After the Communist troops occupying Dongguang between Dezhou and Cangzhou on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, they continued to invade northward. The execution group of the Military Mediation Department believes that the Communist troops in the area intend to violate the order and will take "effective measures."

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] Under the three commissioners of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters is a Joint Staff Department (the department was initially called the Execution Group, and then changed to the Execution Office). The government representative is Cai Wenzhi, the Communist Party representative is Geng Biao, and the U.S. representative is Colonel Hanske. In addition to executing the orders of the three commissioners, the Joint Staff Department can also make recommendations to the three commissioners. In addition, a group of U.S. personnel of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters will move from the Beijing Hotel to the Xiehe Hospital for office work starting today. From now on, the personnel of the three parties will work together. It is learned that the department gathered representatives of the three parties and held a meeting at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss various current tasks.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 19th] Tu Shuwu, Chen Shuliang, U.S. representative Lake of the Jinan Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, and Wei Ji, secretary of the Shandong Provincial Government, went to Tai'an, Yanzhou, Tengxian, and other places to spread the ceasefire order and investigate the actual situation.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] In order to quickly stop the ongoing conflicts, the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, in addition to distributing leaflets in fifteen cities and towns in Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shandong provinces, yesterday specially sent two execution groups to Chifeng and Jining. The execution group sent to Jinan this morning set off as scheduled. Currently, the number of government personnel who have arrived in Beiping is 80, the Communist Party has 30, and the United States has 135. The originally planned personnel of the headquarters were 170 each for the government and the Communist Party, and 120 for the United States.

### Talk Under Gunfire: Mediation Department Hosts Press Conference, Robinson Says "Take It One Step at a Time"

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] The embers of several battlefields are now testing the sanctity of the ceasefire order. At yesterday's press conference held by the Mediation Execution Department, the gunfire in Yingkou and Chifeng became the focus of discussion. A foreign reporter asked if the Communist army had captured Yingkou. Ye Jianying said he had not received any reports regarding the situation. Another Chinese reporter asked what measures Mr. Ye would take to extinguish the flames of war if the Communist army did indeed occupy Yingkou. Ye Jianying's response remained that without a report, he could not answer and did not offer a hypothetical response. The American commissioner, Robinson, explicitly stated that the Northeast was not within the scope of the Execution Department's work. When a reporter asked what would happen if the military conflicts in the Northeast affected areas within the Execution Department's jurisdiction, Robinson sighed softly, "Let's take it one step at a time!" The actions of General Du Yuming's troops also became another focus of attention for foreign reporters, who repeatedly asked if Du's troops were still advancing after the ceasefire order. Commissioner Zheng Jiemin replied, "They have not advanced. We sent planes to scout on the 16th." Commissioner Ye Jianying, however, confirmed that General Du Yuming's troops were only twenty *li* from Chifeng. In response to inquiries about whether the Communist Party had universally issued a ceasefire order, Ye stated that Yan'an had immediately issued the ceasefire order after both sides signed it, but even at that moment, the flames of war continued to rage. According to Commissioner Zheng's report, there were fierce conflicts on the Pinggu Line, Gubeikou, the Jining section of the PingSui Line, and Yuanshi on the Pinghan Line. Gunfire could be heard in Lincheng, Tai'an, and Zaozhuang on the Jinpu Line, Weixian on the Jiaoji Line, and Huangkou on the Longhai Line. The conflict areas reported by Ye Jianying were even more extensive. He said that conflicts were continuing in almost all areas where the Nationalists and Communists coexisted. This vast area included the JinSui District where General He Long was located, the JinJiCha Border Region where Rong Zhen was located, the JinYuLu Border Region where Liu Bocheng was located, the Subei District where Chen Yi was located, the YuEWan Border Region where Li Xiannian was located, the Guangdong District where Zheng San was located, and the Hainan Island District where Feng Boqi was located. He planned to report the conflict situations in various regions to the Three-Person Committee. Regarding how to stop the conflicts, in addition to using planes to distribute leaflets in the conflict areas and dispatching tripartite personnel for mediation, Commissioner Zheng said that they had discussed three other methods today, but did not announce what those methods were. When reporters asked how to handle the administration of ceasefire areas, Ye replied that the three-person team would handle it. As for matters related to surrender and the transportation of prisoners of war, Ye replied that the Execution Department had not yet begun to handle this type of work. Regarding the issue of puppet troops, Commissioner Zheng stated that it was not within his authority to answer, but based on his personal knowledge, the 500,000 Jiangnan puppet troops had already been disbanded, and officers above the rank of colonel were being tried according to law. There were not many remaining puppet troops in North China because the Nationalists and Communists were still in conflict, so they had not yet been able to disarm them. When discussing the restoration of transportation, Commissioner Zheng believed that it could only be discussed after the ceasefire order was effectively implemented. Ye Jianying shared the same sentiment. The main points of American Commissioner Robinson's answers to reporters were: (1) To explain that the American personnel in the Execution Department were neutral and that their task was to help both Chongqing and Yan'an achieve the requirements of the ceasefire plan. All decisions were made by Chongqing and Yan'an, not by the United States. In resolving disputes, the Nationalists and Communists had already reached an agreement in Chongqing, and the Execution Department was carrying out its work under that agreement. All decisions were made with the agreement of all three parties, and the United States had no objection. (2) If there were disputes between the two sides and they continued, how could they be stopped? His answer to this question was, "I have no solution. It depends on Commissioners Zheng and Ye." The hour-and-a-half-long press conference was held in a small reception room at the Beijing Hotel, where forty Chinese and foreign reporters were crowded and unable to move. The Execution Department personnel sat in the front, with the handsome General Ye Jianying sitting on the left end of a long sofa, Zheng on the right end, and Robinson in the middle. On the wall in front of the room was a large oil painting: "A brilliant sunset, about to descend into the sea, setting in the west. In a quiet village by the sea, an old ox, having toiled all day, stopped working, leisurely wagging its tail and eating grass." But the Chinese people, who had suffered for eight years, did not even have time to catch their breath after the victory.

### Joint Statement Released

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] At 4 PM on the 18th, Commissioners Zheng, Ye, and Robinson of the Military Mediation Execution Department jointly released the following written statement at a press conference:

Based on the agreement reached in Chongqing eight days ago regarding the cessation of conflict, the Execution Department has been established in Beiping. The agreement stipulates that the Execution Department will be composed of three commissioners: one representing the National Government, one representing the Chinese Communist Party, and one representing the United States.

This Execution Department has been ordered to be responsible for implementing the agreement to cease conflict, restore transportation lines, quickly conclude the surrender process, and repatriate prisoners of war. This order was issued in the name of the Chairman of the National Government after unanimous agreement by the three commissioners. Each of the three commissioners has an executive group working in parallel. All duties are jointly planned and executed by these three parallel executive groups, which are also working to stop the fighting and preparing in isolated areas that have not yet received the ceasefire order. The eight ceasefire executive teams that have now been established are sending ceasefire orders to all strongholds within their respective areas of responsibility. Each team is composed of representatives from the National Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the United States, and they are accompanied by aides and interpreters to assist in their work and communication teams to maintain constant contact with the Execution Department.

After contacting the fighting parties in the areas of local conflict, the dispatched teams will deliver the ceasefire orders. If conflicts continue after the orders have been issued, and it is confirmed that the troops involved in the disputes have indeed received the ceasefire orders, the teams will report to the Execution Department, which will then report the actual situation to the negotiating authorities in Chongqing.

Once it is confirmed that the orders to cease fire and restore transportation have been received, the authority of this Execution Department shall not extend beyond the scope of investigation and reporting.

In this process, many difficulties must be overcome, the most serious of which is the lack of transportation. After years of war, China's transportation is almost completely chaotic, and it will take a considerable amount of time for troops in many remote areas to receive orders. Therefore, incidents of conflict may occur, but if, after investigation, it is indeed proven that such conflicts are caused by a lack of transportation and that the ceasefire order has not yet been received, then these conflicts shall not be considered a violation of the ceasefire agreement. Due to the limitation of the number of our working personnel, especially at present when the organization of the Executive Department is not yet perfect, we cannot dispatch teams to every conflict site. We will give priority to investigating each conflict event, and dispatch teams to the areas where the investigation may produce the greatest benefit.

As of now, three teams have been dispatched to Jinan (Shandong), Jining (Suiyuan Province), and Chifeng (Rehe Province). Other teams are preparing to depart at any time.

The Execution Department has used American airplanes to scatter leaflets in fifteen cities, towns, and villages in Chahar, Suiyuan, Rehe, Hebei, and Shandong. These leaflets include the ceasefire orders issued by Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Chinese National Government, and Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party. If necessary, airplanes scattering leaflets can be dispatched at any time. In addition, leaflets have been distributed requesting both sides to allow food and goods to pass freely through their territories.

In the past six days, the three commissioners and their staff have established a thorough working agreement, and their opinions have become consistent. We hope that this will continue in the future. Undoubtedly, we will have some differences of opinion, but we believe and hope that these differences can be reconciled under the spirit of cooperation maintained by the Execution Department.

### Azerbaijan Province Incident: Health Officially Files Complaint; Pearson Most Highly Touted for "World Prime Minister" Position; UN General Assembly Scheduled to Begin Discussion Next Wednesday

[Our Report] London, 3:00 AM, 20th: The Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly took formal steps tonight to bring the Azerbaijan dispute before the Security Council. The head of the Iranian delegation sent a document to Jambot, the administrative secretary of the United Nations, stating, "After careful consideration, the Iranian delegation requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in accordance with Article 35 of the United Nations Charter, to present the issue of Soviet interference in Iran's internal affairs to the Security Council for investigation and appropriate recommendations to resolve this dispute."

[Our Report] London, 2:00 AM, 20th: The United Nations Administrative Committee formed a subcommittee this afternoon to conduct preliminary work on the appointment of a Secretary-General of the United Nations. When the Security Council convenes next Wednesday, it will discuss the appointment of a "World Prime Minister," as the importance of the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations is equivalent to that of a "World Prime Minister." There are many possible candidates for this position, but Pearson, the Canadian Ambassador to Washington, is the most highly touted. The Economic and Social Council will also hold its first meeting next Wednesday. At the same time, the Security Council will order the convening of the Military Staff Committee to determine the number of naval, land, and air forces that the fifty-one nations should contribute to the United Nations.

[United Press, London, 18th] The Iranian delegation discussed all day today how and when to bring the Iranian-Soviet dispute before the United Nations General Assembly, but no decision was reached. An Iranian spokesman declared that no decision would be made tonight and that the meeting would reconvene tomorrow morning.

[Associated Press, London, 18th] Iran today cautiously announced its intention to request the assistance of the United Nations Security Council to resolve the issue of Soviet occupation forces in Iran, while Soviet representative Gromyko delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, vigorously defending the dominance of major powers in the Security Council and other United Nations bodies. This can be described as a coincidence. Iranian officials are clearly hesitant about how to file a complaint with the Security Council and have made it clear that they do not want to cause unnecessary disputes with the Soviet Union. The United Nations is reluctant to openly discuss the matter, with only off-the-record contacts. Delegates behind the scenes see that if this matter reaches a "showdown" stage, it could have serious consequences.

### General Assembly Ends Debate: Will Now Enter Subcommittee Stage; French Representative's Speech Attracts Audience Attention

[Central News Agency, London, 18th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly is proceeding rapidly at the end of this week and will officially enter the subcommittee stage on the 21st. The work of the subcommittees is expected to be completed within two or three weeks. The most important item is the discussion of the joint proposal by six countries to establish an Atomic Energy Commission, which has been submitted to the Political and Security Subcommittee of the General Assembly for preliminary study and review.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The Plenary Assembly of the United Nations convened this morning in Central Hall, London. This was the last day of the general debate of the Assembly. French Foreign Minister Bidault addressed the Assembly this morning, stating, in brief, that the first session of the United Nations General Assembly is attempting to solve not only technical problems related to the future of every nation and mankind, but that responsible politicians feel the importance of their tasks and are willing to do their best to replace the rampant war of many years with lasting peace, and to replace the cruelty and violence with the love of justice. The Charter we have signed contains basic requirements and will inevitably become the Charter of all peoples. Peace and security must be supported by mankind with faith and loyalty. Mankind, having suffered so much terror this time, hopes that the right to survival will be guaranteed. Bidault continued to praise the great idea of the late Roosevelt in creating the United Nations. Finally, he expressed that the French government was very pleased to see the progress of the organization's work.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The leader of the French delegation, Foreign Minister Bidault, is scheduled to speak at the Plenary Assembly today. All parties are now eager to hear France's views on trusteeship, so attention is now focused on Bidault's speech. Regarding the issue of mandated territories, three views have been expressed in the Assembly: (1) Britain, Australia, and New Zealand have all announced their readiness to hand over some of their mandated territories to the Trusteeship Council. (2) The Union of South Africa insists that its mandated territory in Southwest Africa should be incorporated into the Union of South Africa. (3) The Soviet Union wants the mandated territories to be granted autonomy as soon as possible. French sources within the United Nations expect that Bidault will not join the general movement to abandon mandated territories.

[Reuters, London, 19th] Belgian representative Langenhove announced last night at the Plenary Assembly of the United Nations that Belgium intends to hand over its mandated territory of Ruanda-Urundi in central Africa to trusteeship.

### Vishinsky: Mysterious Whereabouts; One Account Placed Him in Turkey

[Reuters, London, 19th] Even the most famous movie stars cannot be as sought after as Vishinsky, the Soviet Chief Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. Since the opening of the Assembly on January 10th, the halls have resounded with questions of "Will Vishinsky be here today?" Some say he has left Moscow, others say he has arrived in Berlin, others say he has returned to Moscow, and some even say he has been seen in Croydon. Even the official TASS news agency does not know where its chief representative is staying. A certain representative from a South American country, known for his astuteness, today learned from an authoritative source that Vishinsky has left Moscow by plane. When a reporter asked when he would come to London, the representative replied, "He is not coming here; he has flown back to Moscow."

[United Press, London, 18th] According to Angola Broadcasting: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky recently met with Turkish Foreign Minister Saka under extremely secretive circumstances. Saka proposed ceding the provinces of Kars and Ardahan to the Soviet Union, but only if the Soviet Union abandoned its demand that the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles become part of the Georgian province. Saka also claimed that Britain and the United States might agree to the Soviet Union's demands for the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, but would definitely not agree to the demands for the Dardanelles.

### Indian Representative Calls for Racial and Social Equality

[Reuters, London, 19th] The head of the Indian delegation, Mudaliar, spoke yesterday at the United Nations General Assembly, vigorously calling for social equality for all classes and races. He said: "There must be social equality before the root of war can be removed. If so, the Security Council can adjourn and leave the work to the Economic and Social Council. As for the atomic bomb, he hopes that the planned control measures will become a reality and not just an illusion. Looking around the hall, he felt that the atmosphere was harmonious, and it was difficult to believe that the atomic bomb existed. Although this bomb has indeed been invented and seems to have caused great changes, it will ultimately not be able to destroy the doctrines of various religions. We have now reached a stage where we do not want empty talk, but only seek reality, and that is why we have established this United Nations organization. We are deeply gratified that the major powers have respected the dignity of the Charter and have successively reiterated their desire to maintain peace." When Mr. Mudaliar took the stage to speak, the delegates responded with warm applause.

[Associated Press, London, 19th] The Soviet representative spoke yesterday at the United Nations General Assembly, opposing the reduction of the power of the major powers in the Security Council. Today, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser criticized the veto power of the major powers in the Security Council. New Zealand's opinion on the Atomic Energy Commission is also different from that of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, believing that the committee should report to the fifty-one-nation Assembly and not just to the eleven-nation Council.

Yugoslav Prime Minister Gater, the first person to speak yesterday, stated that in this new organization, the major powers must be given rights and responsibilities, and the Charter should not be amended to restrict them. Yugoslavia also intends to draw the attention of the United Nations General Assembly to the fact that its ethnic boundaries have been forced eastward by fascist troops, and this matter must be resolved. Mr. Gater's remarks almost certainly refer to the border dispute between Yugoslavia and Italy.

### Forrestal to Be Succeeded by Bowles as Undersecretary of the Navy

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Undersecretary of the Navy Forrestal resigned, and President Truman today appointed Bowles as his successor. Mr. Bowles recently served as a commissioner for Japanese reparations and has not been back in the country long. Undersecretary of the Army Lovett has also resigned, and his vacancy will be filled by Symington, the current director of the Surplus Property Administration. Both appointments have been submitted to the Senate for approval.

### British, American, Soviet, and French Foreign Minister Representatives Discuss Treaties with Five Countries; British Foreign Secretary and Italian Deputy Prime Minister Hold Extensive Talks

[Associated Press, London, 18th] American Foreign Minister Representative James Dunn, British Foreign Minister Representative Campbell, Soviet Foreign Minister Representative Gusev, and French Foreign Minister Representative Mouvelle held their first meeting this evening to discuss treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, based on the agreement reached at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers. At the same time, American Secretary of State Byrnes announced that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union had sent a reply to France stating that the opinions of other relevant countries on the treaties would be fully considered. However, France can only participate in the discussion of the treaty with Italy, not the others. According to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Agreement, the treaties drafted by the representatives of the relevant countries, with the consent of the foreign ministers of each country, will be convened at a peace conference in Paris on May 5 by representatives of the twenty-one warring countries. At that time, representatives of all countries can express their opinions. However, the final decision-making power on the terms of the treaty rests solely with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union for the treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. For the Italian treaty, it rests with the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. For Finland, it rests solely with Britain and the Soviet Union, because the United States did not declare war on Finland.

[Associated Press, London, 18th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin met today with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Nenni and discussed many issues. According to a spokesman for the Italian embassy, they exchanged views on the status of the Italian Socialist Party, future elections in Italy, and the Italian peace treaty.

### Contents of Reply to France Published

[American News, Washington, 18th] The State Department today released a note from Secretary of State Byrnes to the French government, dated January 13th, which was published simultaneously in London, Paris, and Washington. "I am pleased to learn that the French government has expressed its willingness to participate in the conference to consider peace treaties, and I hereby invite the relevant governments to send representatives to Paris to attend the conference. Therefore, I hereby issue the following statement on behalf of the governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Report: (1) The French government will be informed of the future work of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. As far as we know, the future task of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. However, after the peace conference is held, the signatory countries to the armistice treaty will draft the final treaty with reference to the recommendations of the peace conference. As stated in the French government's letter, the Potsdam Agreement stipulates the preparation of a peaceful solution for Germany, and the Moscow Agreement has no intention of changing this point. In addition, the Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the member governments can assign tasks to the Foreign Ministers' Conference at any time, and the Moscow Conference did not change this provision. (2) Regarding the second point of the French government's letter, the Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the Foreign Ministers' Conference may invite representatives of these governments to attend whenever issues related to other governments are discussed. Since the Moscow Agreement had no intention of revoking the Potsdam Agreement, the Foreign Ministers' Conference still retains the right to invite representatives of relevant countries to attend the discussions. (3) In future meetings, extensive and thorough discussions will be held, and final conditions will be drafted only after full consideration of the recommendations of the conference. The French government can rest assured on this point. We firmly believe that the conclusion of the final treaty will not arbitrarily reject the recommendations put forward by the conference. (4) Regarding the opinions of the countries on the other side of the conditions, the preparatory work for drafting the treaty will take into account the opinions of these countries and provide them with ample opportunity to discuss the treaty and put forward their opinions. I believe that the above explanation has fully explained the work of the conference, and I hope that the French government will confirm its agreement to participate in this conference."

### US Loan to China: $33 Million for Cotton Purchases Approved by US Export-Import Bank

[Washington, D.C., US News Service, 18th] Taylor, Chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, announced yesterday that the bank's board of directors has approved a $33 million credit loan to finance the export of cotton to China. This loan is sufficient to ship 275,000 to 300,000 bales of cotton. The loan terms are largely similar to the US cotton loans the bank made to European countries last October, with one exception. Given the differing time required for ocean and inland transport in China, the new loan to China will require repayment within 24 months after the cotton arrives, rather than the 35 months stipulated for European countries. It is believed that China primarily needs cotton with shorter fibers. This loan, similar in nature to other construction loans previously approved by the bank, aims to assist reconstruction and accelerate the return to peacetime conditions. China does not lack weaving equipment or labor. Today, the demand for cotton textiles is high worldwide, primarily due to production losses in the UK, China, and Japan. Countries lacking cotton fabric manufacturing rely heavily on these regions. China's current raw cotton supply is insufficient for large-scale weaving. This new supply of raw cotton may be sufficient to meet demand. According to recent statistics, Shanghai alone has 2.3 million spindles, and North China has 1 million, available for cotton yarn production. It is reported that on January 1st of this year, Shanghai had fewer than 1 million spindles in operation due to a lack of cotton. With the assistance of this cotton loan, sufficient raw cotton will be available this year to operate approximately 600,000 spindles, potentially increasing cotton fabric production by 500 million yards. This is about one-seventh of China's pre-war annual total production from hand-weaving and machine-weaving. The revitalization of China's cotton textile industry will reduce the burden on the United States in shipping cotton textiles to China for relief through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The reconstruction of weaving can also reduce other relief needs. Increased employment opportunities in China will contribute to China's domestic economic development. The loan terms stipulate that cotton exports will proceed through US private commercial channels, and all qualified cotton exporters may utilize this loan. Within the limits of this loan, all loans will be guaranteed by approved Chinese banks and the Chinese government.

### US Petroleum Experts Depart for China to Assist in Developing the Oil Refining Industry

[New York, United Press, 18th] The National Resources Committee announced today that four petroleum experts will leave the US for China on the 20th of this month to assist China in building and developing its oil refining industry. The four experts are Iglesias and Chan Lai, representatives of Universal Oil Products Company, and Ruebel and Small, representatives of United Engineering Company. The former two will be responsible for drafting plans for the construction and development of oil refineries, while the latter two will examine the current state of existing refineries, plan the repair of damaged refineries, and expand the kerosene industry to meet China's current and future needs. According to United Engineering Company, its engineers will conduct on-site inspections of areas where oil has already been extracted, paying particular attention to areas close to densely populated cities.

### US President Acknowledges Mediation Failure, Steel Industry to Stage Major Strike, 800,000 Members to Strike on Monday Morning

[Chicago, United Press, 19th] Government efforts to resolve two major labor disputes in the United States have failed today. Eight hundred thousand steelworkers have re-issued orders to strike starting Monday due to US Steel's rejection of President Truman's wage increase proposal. President Truman issued a statement from the White House, saying that this was a matter of great regret for him and the nation. All efforts to avoid a steel industry strike have so far failed.

[Pittsburgh, USA, United Press, 19th] The labor dispute in the US steel industry has been prolonged and unresolved, and an unprecedented strike is about to erupt. According to the planned schedule, at one minute past midnight tomorrow, "750,000 steelworkers will strike." Workers at the largest US steel mills have already begun picketing today. According to the union's "strike list," 1,292 steel mills in thirty states are on strike.

[New York, Reuters, 19th] According to a White House official spokesman, President Truman has no plans to intervene to avoid a strike at the last minute. Unless there is an unexpected and surprising action, this most important basic industry in the United States will shut down on Monday, and other industries in the US production economy will be affected within a few weeks. President Truman still hopes for a solution, but both sides are now preparing for a battle and there is no sign of reconciliation. Earlier, the union had accepted President Truman's proposal to avoid a labor dispute, but US Steel President Fairless did not agree, and negotiations, which had lasted a week under President Truman's leadership, broke down. Meanwhile, the president of the New York Transport Workers Union said that workers on subway and surface public vehicles would strike within two weeks, at which time all transport services in the city would be shut down. The labor dispute involving meatpacking workers remains deadlocked.

### International Military Tribunal Established in Tokyo to Try Far East War Criminals, Maximum of Nine Judges to be Appointed by MacArthur, Kagesa Teikun and Tani Hisao are Both Prisoners

[Tokyo, United Press, 19th] MacArthur today ordered the establishment of an International Military Tribunal to try Far East war crime suspects, and at the same time promulgated detailed trial regulations. The tribunal will be located in Tokyo, and the number of judges will be at least five and at most nine, nominated by the countries that signed the Japanese surrender document, and then appointed by the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. After the tribunal is established, it will quickly and fairly try the major war criminals in the Far East and impose the punishment they deserve. Individuals or members of any group accused of crimes against peace will be tried, as will others who have committed inhumane crimes. The Chief Justice and Prosecutor of the tribunal will be appointed by MacArthur, but the United Nations who fought against Japan may appoint Assistant Judges. The tribunal shall ensure that the trial period is not unnecessarily delayed, and will not accept appeals unrelated to the trial. The tribunal may also determine whether the defendant is physically or mentally fit to stand trial.

[Tokyo, Central News Agency, 18th Dispatch] Allied Headquarters today ordered the arrest of 111 Japanese officers and Japanese suspects, including five generals, whose names are familiar to the Chinese people. The five are Kagesa Teikun, Tani Hisao, Isogai Rensuke, Wachi Takaji, and Kawaguchi, all of whom bear major responsibility for the war against China. Among the five arrested, the most well-known to our people is Lieutenant General Kagesa, who was the brains behind the puppet Nanjing government and a close friend of Wang Jingwei. He served under Isogai Rensuke and implemented attacks in China. Another who caused our people to gnash their teeth in hatred was Tani Hisao, the former commander of the Japanese 6th Division. When he entered Nanjing, he created the shameful "Nanjing Massacre" in the history of the Sino-Japanese War. Isogai Rensuke was the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and he and Wachi Takaji were the right-hand men of Doihara Kenji before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Kawaguchi was the Japanese military spokesman in Beiping after the outbreak of the war.

[Beiping, United Press, 19th] Former German Ambassador to Japan, Eugen Ott, is being escorted to Tokyo today and will be questioned about various matters related to the Tojo Cabinet, as former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo will soon be tried as a war crime suspect. He had been living in Beiping for the past three years and was arrested by US military police on Thursday and flown to Japan yesterday. Ott served as the German Ambassador to Japan from April 1938 to January 1942. During that period, he played a significant role in strengthening the Axis relationship between Germany and Japan. He participated in the negotiations of the Anti-Comintern Pact and was one of the signatories of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Japan, and Italy.

### Korean Students Demonstrate Against Trusteeship, Police Kill Two, 119 Arrested

[Seoul, United Press, 19th] Over two hundred members of the Right-wing Korean Student Alliance held a demonstration last night to oppose trusteeship. Carrying posters, the students marched past the Soviet Consulate and the US Occupation Forces Headquarters. This morning, police intervened and clashed with the students. Police fired over a hundred shots, resulting in two deaths and several injuries, and 119 arrests. The left-wing People's Party newspaper "People's Daily" was attacked by demonstrators and suffered heavy damage. Afterwards, US military commander General Hodge gave a broadcast speech, demanding an end to the demonstrations. US observers believe that opposition to trusteeship is merely an excuse, and the real issue is the struggle between the extreme left and the right.

### Japanese Shidehara Cabinet Controlled by Mitsuchi, Suzuki and Fujita to be Dismissed

[Tokyo, Central News Agency, 18th Dispatch] The most well-informed sources in the Japanese Cabinet believe that the reorganized Shidehara government is the Mitsuchi Cabinet because the newly appointed Interior Minister Mitsuchi Chuzo is actually controlling the Shidehara government. It is pointed out that Mitsuchi has placed his confidants in the cabinet and has influenced Shidehara's selection of personnel. Mitsuchi originally intended to be the prime minister of the new cabinet, but Shidehara ultimately decided to reorganize instead of resigning completely, which was in fact a concession to Interior Minister Mitsuchi.

[Tokyo, United Press, 19th] Today's "Minpo" predicts that Emperor Hirohito's closest confidants, Suzuki Kantaro and Fujita Hisanori, will also be forced to resign in the short term due to MacArthur's instructions. Suzuki was the prime minister at the time of Japan's surrender and is now the President of the Privy Council. Fujita is the Minister of the Imperial Household. The newspaper said that they will resign as soon as Prime Minister Shidehara resumes work. It also said: "After a detailed study of the Allied Supreme Commander's instructions, it is known that not only the President of the Privy Council but also other members of the Council should be held responsible for the war and removed from office. If the government does not abolish the Privy Council and reorganize the Imperial Household Ministry, it will be suspected of intending to deceive the instructions."

Issuing Emergency Order to Force Grain Collection

[Tokyo, United Press, 19th] The Japanese cabinet decided today to issue an emergency order to restore full control of staple foods in order to cope with the serious food shortage in the country. The cabinet's decision was made because the amount of rice sold by farmers to the government by January 10th was only 28 percent of the stipulated total. This order empowers government authorities to forcibly purchase rice from farmers who have not supplied the stipulated amount, and those who violate the order will be severely punished. The penalties include imprisonment for up to three years or a fine of up to 10,000 yen. This order also gives the government the power to strictly control food transactions in the market and to restore price controls on perishable foods. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to determine the supply of farm tools to farmers based on the amount of rice they deliver.

### Climbing Mountains and Crossing Valleys: Running Single and Risking Lives for Money

[Bern, Reuters, 19th] Italian smugglers, in groups and armed, stream across the snowy peaks of the Swiss-Italian border into Switzerland. Swiss border guards conduct dangerous patrols in the mountains, leading to small-scale clashes and increasing casualties on both sides. According to Swiss authorities, the mountains are bitterly cold, and there are frequent deaths from avalanches. However, Italian smugglers, driven by profit, still flock to the area. They smuggle goods such as rice and sugar, which are strictly controlled in Switzerland, and return with coffee and tobacco, which are plentiful in Swiss stocks. These goods are sold at very high prices on the black market in Italy. The authorities, concerned about the rampant smuggling, have transferred special border guards from the north to the southern border to deal with the situation, and there is a proposal to deploy regular troops to reinforce them. However, the Swiss people in the border area, who are making a good profit, oppose the authorities' measures. Those who are unwilling to cooperate are even assassinated. The Swiss customs authorities have issued a serious warning to the people that those who participate in smuggling activities will be severely punished.

[Haifa, United Press, 18th] According to reliable sources, 900 Jews, including 368 women, arrived on a 500-ton steamship in an attempt to evade the Palestinian immigration authorities and enter the country illegally. However, they were intercepted by British planes and warships and were unable to achieve their goal. The ship, flying the blue and white flag of Jewish nationalism from its mast, was spotted by a British plane yesterday 40 miles off the coast of Palestine. A destroyer then arrived to intercept the ship and sent a team to board it, ordering it to sail to Palestine. No accidents occurred during the landing of the Jews. They were guarded by a large number of troops from the British 6th Airborne Division and transported by bus to the Athlit detention camp south of Haifa. According to a statement issued from Jerusalem, the ship's owner and crew have been detained, and the ship is also being guarded by troops. The ship's owner has been identified as a Romanian, but the nationality of the flag it was flying is unknown.

Five people on board were ill and sent to hospital, but the rest were in good health. The ship's name, "Sereni," was taken from an Italian Jewish labor leader who was brutally murdered after German paratroopers landed in northern Italy. Several passengers on board were recent escapees from concentration camps, and the rest of the Jews were refugees from all over Europe.

Director Sun Xiaolou and all key personnel have arrived in Hangzhou one after another to start work. Mr. Sun told reporters that post-war relief work has no precedent to follow, and he hopes that impartial local figures will exert their efforts to assist in its success. A small number of relief supplies have already been transported to Hangzhou, and the old site of the Chengzhan Hotel has been designated as a warehouse. As for the seawalls along the Qiantang River in Zhejiang, they have suffered much damage due to eight years of neglect. Mr. Sun has dispatched personnel to inspect the dangerous sections of the seawall project and prioritize urgent repairs.

Pinghu

Petition for Thorough Investigation into the Release of Captured Bandits

On the previous day, eight plainclothes bandits, carrying guns and live ammunition, suddenly arrived at the county, village, township town and robbed shops and residents of their property, and chased the masses in the city, looting rice and demanding money. For a time, the people were panicked and closed their doors. The villagers reported to the Township Winter Defense Team and Special Task Force, who captured seven people on the spot and escorted them to the township office. Several of them were police officers during the enemy puppet regime. Zhu township chief then sent someone to escort the captured bandits to the county for legal action. However, due to the late hour upon arrival in Pinghu, the bandits were temporarily lodged in the Special Task Force of the East Gate. Unexpectedly, they were overheard by a patrol team from the County Police Bureau that night, who went to rob them and released them completely, and instead detained Zhu township chief and four plaintiffs. More than two hundred villagers from the village have automatically gone to the county government, the Provisional Council, and the county party headquarters to petition, and severely punish the releasing officer.

Huzhou

Using Counterfeit Money, Arrested on the Spot

Xu Jingen from Suzhou carried a large amount of counterfeit currency and used it in Huzhou recently. On the evening of January 12, he went to Taifeng, Baocheng and other silver shops and bought gold rings one after another. On the morning of the 13th, he went to Ruiyuanfu Silver Shop to trade jewelry. Because the small denomination thousand-yuan legal tender of the Central Bank he used (issued in the 34th year of the Republic of China) had a blurred portrait of Sun Yat-sen and looked suspicious, he sent the original currency used by Xu for identification by the local bank. It was found to be counterfeit, and the police were immediately alerted, and Xu was arrested along with the counterfeit ticket and taken to the bureau for interrogation according to law.

Cixi

Shushan Township Chief Dies in Action against Bandits

Near Shushan Township in this county, on the morning of the 8th of this month, dozens of bandits suddenly came with fully armed light machine guns and rifles, attempting to invade the township. This was detected by Township Magistrate Cai Shanglian, who immediately led his team to suppress them. When they arrived at Lubu Town, they encountered the bandits, and both sides opened fire on each other. Township Magistrate Cai was unfortunately shot and killed by the bandits. The county government considers that the township chief bravely fought against bandits and died in the line of duty, and will hold a memorial service in the coming days.

Wenling

Showing Compassion for the People's Difficulties, Reduce the Purchase of Military Grain

The Wenling County Council of the Province of Taiwan, considering that this county was ordered to raise 51,030 piculs of military grain, with a price of 2,200 yuan per picul, and that the county's total farmland is 476,684 mu of level land and 16,730 mu of mountain land, with about 148,024 mu of barren sandy land in these two categories, and an average yield of about 2 piculs per mu for medium harvests, the total harvest of the county is 986,828 piculs, and the population of more than 500,000 is already feeling insufficient. In recent years, it has suffered from disasters and famines. If the purchase is made according to this amount, the rich will have no means of living, and the poor will have difficulty finding food. The current market price of rice is about 8,000 yuan per picul, a huge difference. It should be purchased with reduced amounts and adjusted prices in consideration of the people's difficulties to relieve the people's distress.

Wuhu

Patrolling Police Shot by Soldiers

The Municipal Police Bureau, in order to maintain winter prevention and security, divides into groups for patrols and random household checks every night. On the evening of the 15th, it was discovered that a large number of soldiers were hiding in the Jiatai Foreign Company at No. 26 Siming Road, setting up several beds and openly smoking opium. Four sets of smoking paraphernalia were collected and taken back. Unexpectedly, after leaving the door, the soldiers in the room each took out their short guns and fired, and three people, including police chief Fang Kun and police officer Zhang Dechuan, died on the spot, and two police officers, including Zhang Guocai, were seriously injured. After receiving the report, the police bureau dispatched a large team with weapons to rush to the scene and surrounded the house. The soldiers in the room continued to fire their guns to resist, and the whole city was shocked. Then, the platoon leader of the military police team led a large team of armed military police to arrive and arrested twelve soldiers who caused the disaster and handed them over to the military police team for interrogation. The residents of the accident were the Sixth Communications Group of a certain army. In addition to reporting the facts to the Army Headquarters and the provincial government, the police bureau will raise funds to treat, comfort, and mourn the police officers who died and were injured.

### American General and Diplomat – Eisenhower – Current Situation in Washington, D.C.

The massive Pentagon building in Washington is still the nerve center of the world's strongest army, always operating at a wartime pace. Inside the orderly building, the air carries a sense of tension. Orders are executed quickly and accurately here, and files filled with numbers move from one desk to another, from one office to another, fully demonstrating the fervor of wartime work. At the moment, taking the lead in everything is the powerful personality of the new Chief of Staff, Eisenhower. He makes it clear that there are still many difficult problems to be solved, all of which require a combined application of talents as a soldier and a diplomat.

President Truman Believes that Eisenhower is "Our First-Class Diplomat"

General Eisenhower, who recently succeeded General Marshall to the highest position in the entire international army, deserves to be remembered for his great achievements. In the victory in Europe, he played a decisive role in strategy and tactics, which is an undeniable fact. If further proof is needed, then the former staff of the German General Staff made it clear at the Nuremberg Tribunal that the biggest factor that brought the proud and powerful Third Reich to its knees was none other than Eisenhower's superhuman talent as a general.

President Truman once told a visitor that in his mind, Eisenhower "is exactly the first-class diplomat we can have." The president's selection of him as Marshall's successor must be closely related to this important understanding, because in the coming months and years, how to deal with the people, and how to eliminate the contradictions and disorders in American military policy, is really the main task of the Chief of Staff, and the U.S. Army will obviously shoulder an unprecedented important task in the future world situation, and its nature, the diplomatic component is naturally far more than the preparedness component.

General Eisenhower, who is burdened with the important task of Chief of Staff, fulfills two broad tasks: First, in addition to the "commanding the army" which is his natural job, he must provide advice to the Secretary of the Army, the President, and Congress on all policies related to the military. Second, he must be responsible for the implementation of policies established or practiced by the Army in the future. He insists that within the scope of his advisory authority, he has the right to argue and disagree, but for policies that have been established and implemented by him, he believes that his responsibility is to implement them conscientiously, without dissent.

All important actions and decisions of the Army are carried out in the name of the Chief of Staff, so the responsibility for final consideration of each important decision rests on him. Naturally, the scope of this matter is very broad, and it is impossible for him to measure and decide on so many complex issues (and many highly technical ones), so a set of daily work is very important.

Eisenhower's Determination: "If I Don't Firmly Believe that America Can Make the Greatest Contribution to the World, I'll Only Do It for Five Minutes."

In the first few weeks of his tenure, many things were sorted out by his staff and simplified. They all praised Eisenhower's wisdom and decisiveness in dealing with complex problems.

But the biggest of the problems he deals with every day is demobilization. He has instructed his staff to study to understand what is the most dangerous link in the problem. He is concerned about the extent to which the dissolution of American troops reveals military weaknesses? To what extent will the United States lose prestige and influence on order and stability in other parts of the world? This stable order was originally exchanged for great sacrifices in the war.

Eisenhower must use all his talents and diplomatic skills to prevent demobilization from going too far and to reduce the serious pressure from Congress to "bring my children home." The people of the Army Department now think that he will definitely act proactively, even at the cost of sacrificing his very high prestige. This can be proved by a conversation he had with one of his staff after taking office:

"We fought this war not to maintain the status quo, but to change some terrible scenes for the better. If I don't firmly believe that a strong America will make the greatest contribution to world peace, then I will only do the current job for five minutes at most." (American Translation)

General Marshall, along with Mrs. Eisenhower, went to a certain airport in Washington to welcome Eisenhower's enthusiastic return to the motherland. Marshal [standing on the right] went to welcome him in the capacity of a military and political representative.

[Top Picture] On the day Eisenhower returned to Washington, D.C., President Truman held a medal-awarding ceremony for him in the White House and pinned a "Distinguished Service Medal" on his lapel. Beside him is Mrs. Eisenhower. The enthusiasm of the people welcoming Eisenhower's return home was unprecedented in American history.

[Bottom Picture] The day after Eisenhower flew back to his motherland from Paris, he made a trip to New York. When he drove through the bustling city center, the citizens were all out, scrambling to catch a glimpse of the general. The general was moved by the enthusiasm of the crowd and responded with smiles, nods, handshakes, and even innocent childish jumps, which were unconsciously revealed.

The picture shows a school child rushing forward and offering flowers to pay tribute to Eisenhower when he visited his alma mater, the United States Military Academy, which made him feel particularly sincere and kind.

### Member Chen Lifu Expresses Views on the National Congress Issues

In the eighth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Chen Lifu expressed the following opinions on the issue of the National Congress:

Regarding the issue of the National Congress, I have heard many insightful opinions from you all, which I greatly admire! I personally feel that when we discuss this issue, we must first recognize several basic concepts: First, during the transition from a one-party political system to a multi-party political system, the existing one-party political system cannot be obliterated. Some people criticize the one-party rule political system as an object of criticism for the transition to a multi-party political system, so everything is considered wrong, and in the end, all problems cannot be solved.

From One-Party to Multi-Party

The Past Cannot Be Denied

Since the reorganization of the Kuomintang in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the methods of nation-building led by its government have actually told us that it has indeed taken the Soviet system as a model. If we must criticize this from the standpoint of a multi-party system, of course, everything is wrong, and it is not easy to solve all problems, because these two systems are fundamentally different. Today, we want to move from a one-party system to a multi-party system. If we absolutely deny the facts of the past one-party system, there is no need for consultation. From the standpoint of a multi-party system, everything about nation-building is a right, and from the standpoint of one-party dictatorship, everything about nation-building is an obligation. In short, in the middle of this stage from one-party to multi-party, we must recognize the facts of both sides in order to reach a fair and reasonable conclusion. There is also a reason why such an election law was produced.

Regardless of What Party They Are

Only Ask If They Can Represent the People

The Kuomintang used revolutionary methods to overthrow the Manchus, defeat the warlords, and convene the National Assembly. The law formulated by the National Assembly stipulated in the Provisional Constitution that before the implementation of constitutionalism, the National Congress of the Kuomintang would exercise the functions of the National Assembly on behalf of the National Assembly. According to this regulation, the National Congress was convened, and the Kuomintang's task was completed only after the Constitution was formulated, promulgated and implemented, so the organizational members of the National Congress included members of the Kuomintang Central Committee, which was in line with the intention of returning power to the people. In our view, this is not a privilege, on the contrary, it is a special obligation. This method was produced from historical evolution, and it is also at the time of returning power, saying that there should be no party members among the representatives. May I ask why he would not hesitate to sacrifice blood and fight for it? It is too strange. National Congress representatives cannot ask what party they are or are not, as long as they represent the people. If a party does not recognize him, then he has to run around between the parties before he can be a representative, which is difficult to be a representative.

Remedial Measures Conform to National Conditions

Must Not Be Regarded As Violating Democracy

Second, remedial measures are suitable for China's national conditions and are not undemocratic. Some people think that assuming representatives are undemocratic. You should know that China's current national conditions are different from those of European and American civilized countries. This can also be seen from the elections. Many people who are qualified to be elected and should be elected often do not compete. If there are no remedial measures, those who are young and active will inevitably be elected, and those who are well-qualified but unwilling to compete cannot participate, which is also a major shortcoming. The production of members of the National Political Council has several items of A, B, C, and D, one of which is produced by designated methods, precisely to remedy the defects just mentioned, because there are many people in China who are willing to come out only after three visits, although from a democratic point of view, it can be said that it is undemocratic, but from a factual point of view, it is quite necessary. The National Congress representatives can be reasonably increased. Third, the explanation of the term of office must be clear. Now, people generally say that the representatives were elected ten years ago, and the term of office of the National Congress representatives is six years, thinking that his term of office has expired. It is not known that the term of office should be calculated from the date of taking office. Since the National Congress has not been convened today, they have not taken office. How can the term of office have expired? There is no regulation saying that from the date of election is his term of office. The term of office of the National Congress representatives should start from the date of the passage of the Constitution. Today, because our interpretation of the term of office is blurred, the issue of whether the representatives are valid or invalid has arisen. To discuss people's livelihood, we must not disregard the law. This democracy is lawless. The focus of democracy is on the majority. More than 900 National Congress representatives are produced from elections in various regions. They include more than 350 million people. They themselves have not denied him. Who has the right to revoke his qualifications? Today, it is definitely not an issue of whether the elected representatives are valid or invalid, but how to reasonably increase the National Congress representatives so that they can better represent all the people and achieve a more thorough purpose for the constitutional work. This is why we want political consultation, and we rely on political methods to solve it.

### The Eighth Meeting of the Negotiation Conference: Heated Debate Among All Parties

The Political Negotiation Conference held its eighth meeting on the 18th at 9:00 AM. The original agenda included: (1) continued discussion of the National Assembly issue, and (2) the draft constitution issue. However, due to the lengthy discussion of the National Assembly issue, the draft constitution was postponed for discussion tomorrow. Thirty-four members, including Li Zhuchen, attended today's meeting. After Secretary-General Lei reported the attendance, Chairman Sun Ke announced the opening of the meeting.

**Luo Longji**

First spoke, opposing the validity of the old National Assembly representatives. He claimed that the government's credibility and current practical political difficulties should be taken into account, but the credibility of the new constitution and the theory of the constitution should also be considered. Luo criticized the arguments of Wang Yunwu, Hu Lin, Fu Sinian, and Zhang Wansheng yesterday, but agreed with the opinions of Guo Moruo and Deng Yingchao. He further proposed the following points on behalf of the Democratic League: (1) If the old representatives are maintained, a public opinion poll must be conducted, held by intellectuals such as industrial, commercial, cultural, and student figures. (2) Hold a runoff election with the old representatives as candidates. (3) Do not convene the National Assembly; instead, experts should draft the constitution, and citizens should vote on it.

**Zhou Enlai**

Then explained the meaning of negotiation, harmony, and politics, resolving three points. He said that because there are different opinions, negotiation is necessary. Although there is debate, each other's opinions should be valued, listened to, and accepted to seek common principles. Zhou also said that recognizing or not recognizing the old representatives is one thing, and the CCP's participation in the National Assembly is another. He opposed recognizing the old representatives.

**Chen Lifu**

Spoke for the first time today, stating that in discussing the National Assembly issue, several basic concepts must first be clarified: First, during the transition from a one-party political system to a multi-party political system, the existing one-party political system cannot be erased. Otherwise, all problems cannot be solved. From the standpoint of multiple parties, all nation-building work is seen as a right, but from the standpoint of one-party dictatorship, it is seen as an obligation. Second, Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the Election Law, which stipulates that the government designates 240 representatives, is a remedial measure. Although not absolutely good, it is suitable for China's national conditions because China is different from Europe and the United States. Those who have the qualifications to be elected and should be elected often consider themselves too noble to run for election, so this method must be used to remedy the situation. Third, the original text does not clearly stipulate the term of office of representatives, so there is controversy. Some people say that the representatives elected ten years ago have already reached the end of their six-year term according to the draft constitution, but they do not know that the term of office should be calculated from the date of assumption of office. Now that the National Assembly has not yet been convened and the representatives have not yet taken office, the term of office is not only not over but has not even started. Moreover, the non-assumption of office by the old representatives during the eight years of the war of resistance is a special circumstance. As for the draft constitution not yet being passed according to law, it cannot be used to limit the term of office of representatives. Chen finally said that to purchase democracy, the law must be taken into account, otherwise, it will be lawless. How can it be called democracy? The representatives elected by the past National Assembly were all produced by various regions of the country. If democracy must be decided by the majority, then no one has the right to cancel their qualifications.

**Wu Tiecheng**

Made supplementary comments on the point of maintaining the old representatives. He said that the reasons for opposing the old representatives are no more than two points: (1) The representatives elected in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) are not sufficient to represent today's public opinion; (2) Many people who did not have the right to vote or be elected in that year have now obtained it and should not be deprived of their rights. Regarding the first point, the representatives elected in the local areas have mostly participated in the war of resistance and service in the past eight years. Their experience and understanding have been improved, and they are more sufficient to represent public opinion. Regarding the second point, those who have obtained the right to vote or be elected today cannot exceed the number of people who had the right to vote or be elected in that year. The rights of a few people should not be taken into account, while the election results of those who have already obtained the right to vote are not recognized. Wu finally said that the National Assembly issue is not purely a theoretical issue but a practical issue.

**Wang Yunwu**

Responded to Luo Longji's opinion. He believes that the foundation of democracy is in the rule of law. If the law is erased, then this kind of democracy is unreliable. The spirit of the rule of law is that the people should abide by the law, and the government should also abide by the law. The government cannot arbitrarily change the law, otherwise, it will conflict with the democratic stance. He believes that the National Assembly Organization Law has a shortcoming, that is, the representatives do not have a fixed term of office, and there is no way to cancel the qualifications of representatives. He agrees to modify it. But the representatives elected in the past must be maintained. He further emphasized that the law and facts should be taken into account, and he hopes that the 460 seats reserved for the KMT's Central Committee members should be given up to accommodate representatives from various parties. Wang also said that Luo believes that these representatives are produced through negotiation and cannot gain the respect of the people, then the constitution drafted in the future will not be able to gain the respect of the people either. He expressed doubt. As for the public opinion poll method, if only intellectuals participate, it is questionable whether it can represent the opinions of the entire population.

**Shao Congen**

Said that he had spent a night thinking hard about this issue and had come up with another method, that is, to solve this problem with three meetings from now on: (1) The first meeting is the current Political Negotiation Conference, and its task is for the various parties to mutually formulate the steps to start democracy, draft and amend the National Assembly Organization Law and Election Law, and even the outline of the draft constitution, and submit a proposal. (2) The second meeting will still be convened on May 5th as proposed by the government, and the Organization Law, Election Law, and draft constitution that we have amended will be submitted to that meeting for discussion and decision as the formal Organization Law, Election Law, and draft constitution. This meeting is equivalent to the preparatory meeting for the National Assembly advocated by Sun Yat-sen. The nine categories of farmers, workers, and businessmen mentioned by Sun Yat-sen are also included, so whether the old representatives are overthrown or not will not become a major issue. (3) The third meeting is the meeting established according to the Organization Law and Election Law decided by the second meeting, and its task is to draft and implement the constitution. Shao believes that this method does not violate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and all aspects of reality and the future of the constitution can be taken into account. (To be continued tomorrow)

**Wang, a member**

Participates in the debate on the National Assembly issue.

**Reader's Opinion**

### Democracy and Military Rule

The Kuomintang speaks of democracy, the Communist Party speaks of democracy, and people from all parties and factions also speak of democracy. Domestic public opinion is like this, and overseas forums are also like this. In short, to this day, no one says they don't want democracy or oppose democracy. But why can't China be democratic? It seems that everyone still lacks an understanding of the core of the problem, so I should say a few words: First, I want to ask, what is democracy? The explanation is very simple: it is sovereignty residing in the people. All people have the right to participate in politics. The Principle of People's Rights in the Three Principles of the People has already stated this clearly. Since China is not a monarchical autocracy but a democratic republic, all people should naturally obtain political liberation. Then, the second question is, how do people participate in politics? The general method is for the people to elect representatives, organize parliament, and establish a government. However, the system in the United States and Britain differs from that of the Soviet Union, and the organization in the United States and Britain differs from that of various countries on the continent. Which one should we adopt?

Because British and American politics are organized by large parties, the party that wins the parliamentary election forms the government. For example, when the Labour Party recently won in the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party handed over power, and the Labour Party formed the cabinet. In continental France, because small parties are separated, it is difficult for any one party to obtain an absolute majority in parliament. Therefore, they have no choice but to form a coalition government with several parties. And because the opinions of each faction often differ, the organization of the coalition government is extremely unstable and often needs to be reorganized and re-elected. It is not the same in the United States and Britain. Once a party has power, it can often maintain it until the second election. In the middle of the specified term, unless there is a split within the party or a major change, it rarely fails to continue. This is the democratic method of parliamentary political countries in Europe and the United States. Because the Soviet Union is a proletarian dictatorship, its so-called Soviets only have representatives of the Communist Party. Although there are also representatives of non-Communist parties, they do not have another party organization, which is equivalent to nothing. They cannot rise up and organize a government, so political power is always in the hands of the Communist Party. This is the "democratic political" method of a one-party dictatorship in the Soviet Union.

As far as China is concerned, the Kuomintang has not advocated a one-party dictatorship (the current political system is a transitional period of tutelage), and what the Communist Party requires is only to organize a coalition government. According to this, China's democratic politics should be a parliamentary system where various parties in Europe and the United States stand side by side, not the Soviet system of Soviets, which is very clear. However, we know that the parliaments of various countries in Europe and the United States are organized by representatives publicly elected by the people. Here, what determines the victory or defeat of each party is the number of its representatives, that is, the number of votes it obtains from the people. This is a fair competition. If money is used in this process, it is bribery, which violates the law. It is even more inappropriate to rely on force. The law stipulates that the army belongs to the state and cannot be privately owned by a certain faction. Soldiers must resign and retire before they can run for election. Therefore, if China wants to implement democracy today and enter the stage of constitutional government, the parliamentary elections of various countries in Europe and the United States are undoubtedly a good example for us.

However, the Communist Party of China's position is different. It says: To organize a coalition government and participate in political power, the Communist Party must have a certain number of ministers, ten provincial chairmen, a certain number of troops, and a certain number of defense zones before elections can be held. Relying on existing military force and chanting the slogan of democracy, even to the point of using the country's Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army for political struggle, can this still be called democracy? To be frank, it is "democracy" in name, but "military rule" in reality! This is the old trick of feudal warlords demanding promotions and pay from the government! This is the greatest insult to the word "democracy" in today's people's century!

In short, if the Communist Party is interested in realizing democratic politics, it must abandon all claims to seize power and return the army to the central government of the country. Only then will it be right, otherwise, everything is an excuse and sophistry. The Kuomintang has declared that it will convene the National Assembly and "return power to the people." Why can't the Communist Party "return the army to the country"? The Communist Party must know that there are absolutely no elections in the world backed by force, nor is there so-called democracy in which the army manipulates the people. Whether the current civil unrest in China can be eliminated depends on whether the Communist Party can abandon its military force. Whether today's democracy in China can be realized also depends on whether the Communist Party can abandon its "military rule"! It is reported that the Negotiation Conference is being held heatedly, and I will watch it from this. (Chen)

### The Mission of Our Delegation to Siam

— Ye Qiuyuan

Our delegation to Siam, led by Minister Li Tiezheng, left Chongqing at the beginning of the month, passed through Kunming and Hanoi, and arrived in Bangkok by special plane the other day. The Siamese government authorities, from the King down, have expressed a warm welcome and reception to the arrival of our delegation in Bangkok, which is indeed opening a new page in the history of Sino-Siamese relations. Although we have not yet seen the government's announcement of the mission of the delegation to Siam, it is generally observed that it is nothing more than to promote good neighborliness, so that the new situation in the Far East caused by the collapse of the Japanese invaders can be adjusted from the standpoint of Sino-Siamese relations, and how to strengthen the friendship between the two countries, etc. In today's international and domestic situation, when important events are unfolding continuously, the delegation's visit to Siam may not have received the attention it deserves. However, the mission undertaken by the delegation to Siam is very important. China's position and relations in the new situation in Southeast Asia, as well as the promotion of Sino-Siamese relations, all depend on the efforts of the delegation to Siam. Now, as the delegation arrives in Bangkok, I would like to discuss Sino-Siamese relations.

China and Siam are interdependent, and overseas Chinese account for almost one-third of the total population. Sino-Siamese relations have always been very friendly. Since the Japanese invaders attempted to create the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," Japan has sent the Fifth Column to carry out activities in Siam on a large scale. Some Siamese people consciously or unconsciously fell for the poison of Japanese propaganda, and the trend aroused the rise of narrow nationalism, renaming their country "Thailand" and imitating Hitler's style of "recovering lost land." They harbored the idea of annexing the ethnic groups residing in our Xifu border area, especially the "Baiyi" in Yunnan Province, and constantly incited them. Since Siam advocated the so-called "Greater Thai Race" movement, Sino-Siamese relations have been fraught with hidden reefs. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, "Thailand" officially became an appendage of the Japanese invaders. The interdependent China and Siam became enemy countries during the war. Under the rule of Luang Phibunsongkhram and his cronies, Siam tried its best to exclude Chinese people. Our overseas Chinese in Siam suffered all kinds of hardships. All of this left extremely unpleasant stains on Sino-Siamese relations. After the Japanese invaders accepted the Potsdam Declaration, Siam also surrendered to the United Nations. Unexpectedly, when Siam laid down its arms, Luang Phibunsongkhram's remnants even incited anti-Chinese sentiment, resulting in a large-scale massacre and looting of our overseas Chinese in Siam. The loss of life and property suffered by our overseas Chinese was extremely serious. At that time, domestic public opinion was full of indignation at Siam's anti-Chinese movement and demanded that the government, in addition to expressing condolences to the overseas Chinese, negotiate with Siam. Our delegation to Siam was formed and went abroad under such circumstances, shouldering its important mission.

The delegation to Siam is composed of members from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and other relevant departments. This visit to Siam, when an anti-Chinese movement occurred in Siam and our overseas Chinese suffered heavy losses, its first task is to express condolences to the overseas Chinese and investigate the truth of the incident in preparation for negotiations with the Siamese government. The number of our overseas Chinese in Siam has reached ten million, many of whom have made indelible achievements in the National Revolutionary Movement. For example, the late Xiao Focheng was the most representative figure. When we were forced to raise the banner of resistance against the enemy, our overseas Chinese in Siam either actively transported military supplies or actively participated in the anti-Japanese work, making a significant contribution to the war of resistance. Our National Government has always been extremely concerned about the welfare of overseas Chinese. Now that an anti-Chinese movement has occurred in Siam, our government has sent a delegation to Siam, and it is believed that it will definitely clear the name of the deceased overseas Chinese and actively protect the welfare of our overseas Chinese in Siam. The delegation's visit to Siam shows the government's concern for the welfare of overseas Chinese. Our overseas Chinese in Siam have endured long-term suffering under Siam's past tyranny. They should express their gratitude for the central government's kindness and encouragement, which goes without saying. I hope that our overseas Chinese, with the enthusiasm of participating in the revolution and participating in the war of resistance in the past, will continue to actively participate in the great cause of national construction, so as not to fail the government's expectations.

From the perspective of Sino-Siamese relations, China and Siam were enemies during the war, but now they are friends. We know that Siam's joining the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" also had its own unavoidable difficulties. With our broad-mindedness, we do not want to make a settlement. The Chairman of our National Government has repeatedly proclaimed to the world that our country has no territorial ambitions in Southeast Asia, which also includes Siam. Whether our government should demand compensation from the Siamese government for Siam's participation in the war is a matter for our government to weigh and is not something we want to discuss here. However, the Siamese government should be responsible for compensating for the losses suffered by our overseas Chinese in Siam during the war and after the war due to the anti-Chinese movement. At the same time, the Siamese government should strictly crack down on the Luang Phibunsongkhram clique and other anti-Chinese movements, so that our overseas Chinese in Siam will not suffer the same damage in the future. Moreover, all Siamese laws containing anti-Chinese meaning should be abolished, so as not to harm the legal rights of our overseas Chinese in Siam. All of these are necessary measures arising from the recent anti-Chinese movement in Siam. If the Siamese government intends to reform itself after the end of the war, it should not be difficult to find a way to resolve these issues and reach an agreement.

The Chinese and Siamese nations have historical origins, and the economic relationship between the two countries is extremely close. They should have exchanged envoys long ago and established normal diplomatic relations. It is a pity that the collusion of the Japanese invaders prevented the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Now the international situation is no longer what it used to be. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly proclaimed China's attitude towards various Asian nations to the world. We not only have no aggressive ambitions, but also want to act as elder brothers to support various Asian nations and jointly seek the welfare of mankind, especially the improvement of the welfare of the Asian people. Siam and China used to communicate tributes and also benefited from some Chinese culture. Now, on the occasion of the defeat and restoration of the country, it should renew its old friendship with its neighbors and continue to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Siamese nations that existed in the past. The number of Chinese children living in Siam has reached ten million. We hope that normal diplomatic relations between China and Siam can be established as soon as possible, and that the relationship between China and Siam, whether cultural, economic, or commercial, can be closer. This is not only related to the friendship between China and Siam but also to the prosperity and peace of East Asia.

The delegation to Siam, under the leadership of Minister Li Tiezheng, is going to Siam with a very important mission. Today's Siam has signed a treaty of peace with the United Kingdom. Although it has suffered territorial concessions and compensation, the signing of this treaty undoubtedly strengthens the power of the Siamese government. In addition, the US Secretary of State also had a statement on Siam, from which it can be seen that although Siam once participated in the Axis as an appendage, now that it has surrendered and restored the country, it has gradually become a member of the international community. Minister Li Tiezheng has extensive experience in Asian diplomacy. It is believed that this visit of our delegation to Siam will definitely achieve its mission.

Commercial News

### Less Speculative Activity, Mediocre Gold and Currency Trading, Old Hong Kong Dollar Returns Slightly to Five Yuan

Yesterday, the market continued to be stable, but because the Exchange Building was unusually tight on funds, large speculators wanted to pull the market up but were forced by the environment, so the process was extremely mediocre, with narrow fluctuations. At the opening in the morning, the rate for gold and currency in the capital was slightly better, although the number was extremely limited, but people felt satisfied. The market immediately rose slightly, and the US dollar did not improve with the gold market. The arbitrage price was still 625 yuan for ten taels. Securities firms made some arbitrage sales, and the supply of gold gradually increased, gradually returning from 939,000 to below 925,000. After that, the volume of transactions gradually decreased, and the market situation remained at around 930,000 until noon under the balance of supply and demand. In the afternoon, because the small markets stopped doing forward contracts, the spot market was extremely mediocre and still remained at around 930,000, a slight increase of 9,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry shops quoted gold ornaments at 100,000, silver bullion at 700 yuan, and silver dollars at around 460 yuan. Due to the large demand from securities firms, the interest rate was about 10.7 cents.

The foreign currency US dollar was very mediocre. Money shops continued to flow out of real goods, and it was difficult to break through the 1,500 mark. People gradually felt bored with the US dollar, so the market price hovered between 1,480 yuan and 1,490 yuan. Except for some hedging activities, there was a lack of speculative activity. At noon, it hovered around 1,490 yuan. There were no special changes in the afternoon, and the result was a slight increase of 7 yuan. The old Hong Kong dollar was bought and sold by Guangbang, with a slight supply, and the result was a small return of five yuan. The new goods in the market were extremely sluggish, once falling to around 73 yuan, and then slightly pulled up. The result was similar to the previous close.

### Public Bonds, Ship Plates, Retail Investors Become Cautious

The volume of public bond transactions is still difficult to recover. People in the industry are scattered, and retail investors have gradually become cautious. In addition, the voices of the authorities' intervention have become louder. Major investors believe that the current market price has reached the saturation point for future repayment in customs gold, and they are waiting for opportunities to recharge their batteries. Although there was a fluctuation of 260 yuan in half a day, the process was extremely mediocre. Although Type C opened flat, many parties came to sell, and the market fell to 1,550 yuan, and then it stabilized slightly. Customer gangs absorbed at low prices, and then rebounded by more than 100 yuan. At noon, it struggled at the 1,700 yuan mark. Miscellaneous brands were even inferior because the opening and closing were earlier. The result was a decrease of 160-170 yuan for Types A, B, D, and E compared to the previous close, and a decrease of 120 yuan for Type C.

### Scarce Supply of Rice, Good Sales of Flour

The rice market in the interior has risen, and it has spread to Daoshen County. People's sentiment has turned bullish, and japonica rice has rebounded by 4-500 yuan. Indica rice has also risen by 2-300 yuan. The supply is scarce due to the rain, and the future trend is still bullish. The flour from the Yangtze River Gang continues to be procured, and the Nanyang flour is slightly taken, but it cannot match the sales, and it continues to rise by another 200 yuan. The oil market has seen more goods from Qingdao, and raw oil has weakened by another 6-700 yuan. Bean oil is scarce and still flat. Second-grade raw kernels have fallen by another 1,000 yuan. The price of liquor is settled, and soybean exports are normal. Local sales are not good, slightly down by 1-200 yuan.

According to (Dagong News Agency), the local food administration authorities are very concerned about the food supply for the people of this city. Recently, as the Lunar New Year is approaching, they are deeply worried that unscrupulous rice merchants will take the opportunity to raise prices and manipulate the rice market. Therefore, in addition to issuing strict prohibitions, they have also purchased 1.5 million piculs of rice from rice-producing areas such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Wuxi, etc. The rice is shipped to Shanghai in batches and stored in warehouses. Two batches have already arrived, so the rice price is expected to be relaxed. In addition, the number of flour mills in this city that have resumed work is increasing, and the daily output has reached more than 20,000 bags. The wheat required for its raw materials is mostly wheat allocated to the factory by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for milling.

### Silk Price Decline

Yesterday, the rayon market learned that silk manufacturers would request raw material allocation, causing weakness in the spot market. The morning price for No. 120 Tianqiao was 1.32 million yuan, reaching a high of 1.356 million yuan, with a closing price of 1.33 million yuan, a slight decrease of 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Warehouse receipts initially traded at 980,000 yuan, eventually reaching 1.05 million yuan, an increase of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon, and sentiment seemed weak. Due to high prices in Wuxi and Sri Lanka, factory costs increased sharply. With no goods shipped from Shanghai, prices remained firm. Silk goods experienced mixed fortunes, with minor fluctuations. American-Asian quilt covers were priced at 780,000 yuan per hundred, and Dachen crepe was priced at 2,420 yuan per yard, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. Minsheng brocade fabrics maintained the previous day's price.

### Cotton Yarn Market Quiet, Poplin Sales Strong

Yesterday, the yarn market saw neither gains nor losses. Fine yarn and doubled yarn factories continued to purchase, with prices similar to the previous day. Sales of 20-count yarn were limited, with a slight decrease of around 5,000 yuan. Sentiment remained stable, and the overall trend was very quiet.

Due to the unexceptional yarn prices, and with the end of the year approaching, cotton mills and cotton merchants adopted a wait-and-see approach, resulting in no transactions.

Shirt poplin, mainly purchased by underwear companies, saw strong sales. Although a few manufacturers have started weaving their own, most underwear companies still rely on dyeing and weaving factories. Recently, Sichuan merchants have been actively buying, leading to a rise in prices. As for blue cloth and shilin cloth, factories have supply quotas, keeping the market stable.

### Tea Prices Rise

Tea sales are typically slow during the winter season. However, this year has seen a reversal of the usual trend, with activity even exceeding previous years. Due to transportation difficulties from various regions, merchants have struggled to ship goods. Currently, transportation is relatively smooth, and demand from various regions is double that of the past. However, those with special grade teas are reluctant to sell due to the limited inventory in the city, leading to gradually rising prices as demand exceeds supply.

### U.S. Cotton Loan Terms

24-Month Term, Similar to Europe

[United Press International, Washington, 18th] According to Export-Import Bank President Taylor, the bank's board of directors has approved a $33 million loan to China for the purchase of 275,000 to 300,000 bales of American cotton. The terms of this loan are largely the same as those for American cotton loans to European countries, except that the repayment period is 24 months after arrival, rather than 15 months. This extension is due to different transportation conditions on the Pacific Ocean and within China.

### Active Metal Transactions, Copper and Tin Show Signs of Recovery

This month, copper, tin, and other metals have remained stable. Recently, however, there have been signs of recovery, with rising prices. Currently, spot tin is selling for 300,000 yuan per old dan, solder is selling for 140,000 yuan, pure tin is selling for 90,000 yuan, Canadian pig lead is selling for 40,000 yuan, and white lead is selling for 55,000 yuan. Copper bars, however, remain around 30,000 yuan.

Metal transactions have been active recently, with rising prices for almost all items, including clout nails, tinplate, lead wire, coiled wire, foreign silver dollars, leather, I-beams, and rebar. Prices have risen by 10-20% compared to the previous week.

### Asphalt Shortage

The asphalt market is increasingly active, but there is no spot oil available from any production area, leading to continuous price increases. According to communications from Jiaxing, a shipment of asphalt has already been sold for 27,000 yuan, with no spot goods available. Communications from Hangzhou indicate that prices have risen to 20,000 yuan, but supply cannot meet demand. Buyers from various places going to Hangzhou and Lanxi are all waiting, but the source is dwindling, leading to a significant shortage of spot oil. Therefore, local merchants in this city are selling this shipment of oil for 30,000 yuan, and Lanxi oil for 25,000 yuan.

### National Expansion of Lending Scope, Commercial Loans Can Be Considered

[United Credit Bureau Report] Previously, in order to adapt to the financial and economic environment during the War of Resistance, the Four Joint Offices formulated principles stipulating that loans from various banks should be limited to industrial and mining production related to national defense and essential goods for people's livelihood. In September 1944, orders were given to various banks to cease ordinary commercial and merchant loans and discounts. This was because during the war, prices were high, commercial profits were substantial, and hoarding was widespread. To protect industrial and mining production, commercial loans were restricted. However, since the victory of the War of Resistance, prices in major cities have generally fallen, and all factors contributing to wartime commercial hoarding have disappeared. In the future, domestic and international transportation will become increasingly smooth, and industrial and commercial enterprises will be closely related. Industry and commerce are interdependent and should not be developed unevenly. It has been decided that loans from various banks should, within their professional scope, appropriately expand lending to relevant production and marketing enterprises, and gradually reduce interest rates to facilitate the flexibility of financial circulation. It is reported that various national banks have been notified to comply.

### Business Summary

The price of foreign paper is firm, sales are active, and inventories are low, making it difficult for prices to fall in the short term.

The lumber market was relatively stable yesterday. It is reported that 100 liang of Hang lumber shipped from Hangzhou were sold at 46,000 yuan per liang. Several thousand liang are still in Hangzhou and will be shipped to Shanghai successively.

Among knitted goods, chrysanthemum undershirts are quite popular on the market, with prices higher than the previous day. Dafafa Towel Factory's price is 6,000 yuan, Dafafa Bed Sheet Factory's price is 6,800 yuan, while the market transaction prices are 5,800 yuan for towels and 6,700 yuan for bed sheets.

The price of American caustic soda continues to weaken. Yongli caustic soda is stable because the factory price has not decreased. The price of tallow caustic soda is slightly higher due to shortages.

Red Gold brand cigarettes are being distributed. It is rumored that British American Tobacco's Wing Tai Wo will also start distributing, causing prices to decline slightly. The prices of Chinese merchant cigarettes are mixed.

The customs authorities of the Ministry of Finance have stipulated that the dutiable value of imported taxable goods will be uniformly calculated based on the wholesale market price at the port of entry.

The Land Administration Bureau's land registration for the six districts of Huangpu, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Fahua, Caojing, and Hunan ended yesterday. To protect the rights of the people, the deadline has been extended by two months.

### Yong Yarn Leads the Way, Chinese Stocks Show Strength

Chinese stocks have moved to the seventh floor for trading. Reports that the stock exchange will soon reopen have attracted a lot of miscellaneous funds. The market opened slightly stronger, but then hesitated as buyers sold off. Small-cap stocks briefly fell to near the previous day's closing price. However, Yong Yarn, fueled by rumors of a dividend of 180 yuan, consistently led the way. Eventually, other stocks were also boosted. Yong Yarn closed at a high price. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn rose 130 yuan, American-Asia rose 70 yuan, Xinyi rose 40 yuan, and the "Three Small" stocks each rose by half a percent. Less popular stocks have been slow to follow.

Foreign stocks were stimulated by Chinese stocks, and funds flocked to buy them. Popular small-cap stocks were especially favored. However, sentiment among professionals was cautious, so the process was not as dazzling as that of Chinese stocks, and could only be described as stable. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Silk rose 50 yuan, Ewo Beer rose 70 yuan, Paper Industry rose 100 yuan, Jardine Matheson rose 100 yuan, and rubber stocks also showed prosperity.

Personnel with the above qualifications can register after the announcement date. Those who pass the review will be assigned and hired without examination.

### Inaugural Shanghai Basketball League Opens Tonight, Three Games in Group A for Women Starting at 6:30 PM at the City Gymnasium

The inaugural Shanghai Basketball League, with 72 teams competing, is divided into Group A, Group B, and women's groups. The opening ceremony will be held at the City Gymnasium on South Shaanxi Road at 6:30 PM this afternoon, with three games. In the women's game, Dahua faces Xueqing. The former has veterans such as Huang Meijuan, and the addition of Rong Mozhen makes it even better. Xueqing's strength is mediocre, and it is likely to suffer a setback. The original game in Group A2 was Blue Team vs. Red Team, but because both the Blue Team and Renyu in Group A1 agreed and requested an exchange, with the permission of the Basketball Committee, the game has been changed to Renyu vs. Red Team. Renyu is the reincarnation of Chengyou, and the Red Team is the original Chengyou Red team. Meeting again is tantamount to infighting, and it is difficult to predict who will win. The final game is South China vs. the foreign soldiers of Sacco. South China's basketball skills have reached their peak, and there will definitely be a wonderful performance.

Three Announcements

Another Basketball Committee Announcement: (1) A specially made electric clock will be used for timing in this league to show fairness, but it is not intended to be adopted permanently.

Players are encouraged to vote openly and not give up their rights.

Tickets for today are all priced at 300 yuan. The opening order list is as follows:

(Dahua) Huang Meijuan, Rong Mozhen, Ju Zhifang, Cheng Mulan, Cai Bingfang, Xue Weiyin, Xue Deyin, Huang Suzhen, Zhang Huifang, Shen Shuwei, Yang Renyun, Deng Qiyao.

(Xueqing) Qian Mengyue, Cao Laifeng, Shi Meifeng, Zhu Zhaozhen, Lin Xueying, Cao Xiaofeng, Bai Yufang, Liu Aidi, Ye Zhaolie, Jin Zifen, Xu Xiuyun, Luo Jiming.

### Negotiations to Borrow Yiyuan Stadium Are Underway, Fifth Meeting of the Football Committee

The Shanghai Football League Committee held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, and the resolutions are as follows:

(1) The capacity of Jiaozhou Park Stadium is too small. During matches, it is difficult to maintain normal order when spectators attend. It is not possible to increase ticket prices to limit attendance, but there will be many important matches in the future, and it will be difficult to accommodate a large number of spectators. The proposal to rent the racecourse stadium has been rejected. Yiyuan Stadium is larger, and the proposal to borrow it is being negotiated by the executive director of the Municipal Sports Association, but no decision has been made yet. It was resolved to ask the executive board of directors of the Municipal Sports Association to proceed quickly, hoping to succeed in the near future for application.

(2) During the match between Xuhui B and Lianxing on January 13th, Xuhui used an unregistered player. The team was penalized with forfeiture, and Lianxing won 1-0. Xuhui was given a final warning.

### Donghua Meets Hequn in Today's Group A Football Match

Held at Jiaozhou Park

Yesterday's three matches in Groups A and C were postponed due to rain. There are eight more matches today, starting at 10:00 AM. In Group A, the Soviet Union faces the Jews at 10:00 AM at Jiaoyuan. The Jews have gained Fu En this year, defeating Qingbai in one fell swoop and drawing with the British Navy in another match. There is great hope for victory today.

In another Group A match, Donghua faces Hequn for the first time. The match will be held at Jiaoyuan at 2:30 PM, with Deng Xiaoliang as the referee. Donghua's lineup was announced by Jia Youliang yesterday and remains the same.

The young players of Hequn are also highly regarded. Their offense and defense are well-organized. Although they may not be able to defeat Donghua, there may be tense moments. Tickets are 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan. The complete order list for today is as follows:

Donghua

Zhang Banglun, Zhang Lingen, Song Lingsheng, Fu Shi, Zhuang Youren, Zheng Yingquan, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Zhan Jing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang

### Chairman Pan Gongzhan Broadcast Yesterday, Appealing for Education Loans

[Dahua News Agency] The New Voice Radio Station, sponsored by the Shanghai Education Association, officially opened yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at 159 Beijing Road. More than 500 people attended, including Director Gu of the Education Bureau, Deputy Director Ge of the Social Affairs Bureau, Deputy Director Chen of the Land Administration Bureau, and representatives from the education and news industries.

Director Gu's Opening Speech

Director Gu gave the opening speech, elaborating on radio education. Shu Xincheng then spoke on "Using Ears Instead of Eyes to Accelerate National Construction," and Zhou Yaocheng spoke on "The Significance of Broadcast Education." Gao Erbo spoke on "Education Loans." At about 4:00 PM, Chairman Pan Gongzhan arrived gracefully. After a short rest, he made a sincere broadcast. His words were so poignant that the audience in the broadcasting room was moved to tears. The main points of his speech are as follows:

Chairman Pan Gongzhan's Broadcast Speech

Listeners! Today, I am invited by the New Voice Radio Station of the Shanghai Education Association to appeal for education loans. Although there are many schools in Shanghai, due to the government's economic difficulties, public schools cannot be universally established. Private schools also have to increase tuition fees because teachers are struggling to make a living. You have probably seen the tuition fee regulations for the next semester in recent newspapers. The tuition fee is set at a maximum of 16,000 yuan for senior high school, 12,000 yuan for junior high school, and 8,000 yuan for primary school. Compared to pre-war tuition fees at current prices, it can be said that it has not increased much. However, even with this not so high tuition fee, how many people can afford it? How many will be excluded? In the past, the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers had loan programs, which helped thousands of poor students. However, both newspapers have stopped their loan programs. How will these thousands of poor students continue their studies in the future? How can you sit idly by and watch them drop out of school? If the government's economy allows, then not only 10,000, but even 100,000 people, the government should be responsible for. However, after eight years of resistance, the government's finances are extremely difficult. In the future, everything needs to be rebuilt, and money is needed everywhere. Although it is known that "education is the first priority," there are even more important and urgent needs, and it is difficult to enumerate them. How can we take care of poor students? Looking back at the current situation in Shanghai, I feel that luxury and extravagance are even worse than before the war. Those who made a fortune during the enemy and puppet regime are now making a fortune from the victory. Hoarding and speculation are prevalent, and their influence is pervasive. The few who have become rich are becoming more extravagant and indulgent, while the majority of the poor are living in deep water and hot fire, crying out without anyone to help. However, I dare to say that this kind of畸形 abnormal and unreasonable phenomenon will not last long. Those who only know how to benefit themselves and not help others will not have good consequences. Think about it, can these oppressed and deprived young people be guaranteed not to rebel? Therefore, I hope that you can donate generously with the intention of saving others and saving yourselves, give money if you have money, and give effort if you have strength, in order to reduce your own sins and at the same time accumulate virtue for your children and grandchildren. Now I am broadcasting this message with this intention, and I deeply hope that you can support it vigorously.

### Official Letter of Clarification

To the Editor: In response to a news item published in your esteemed newspaper on the 18th of this month, which is utterly untrue, we hereby clarify that our factory's current premises are leased from a landlord who has repeatedly stated the need to reclaim the property for personal use. Consequently, in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], we purchased three buildings at 578, 584, and 588 Avenue Haig [now Huashan Road] to serve as factory space. We requested the Daozhong Girls' School to vacate the premises or to sign a lease agreement. Daozhong School not only vehemently refused through its Japanese teachers but also entrusted the pseudo-lawyer Zhang Zhuochen to deposit a small portion of the rent into the pseudo-court, which our factory was unable to accept, causing us immense distress. Since the unconditional surrender of the enemy, we have appealed to the court for mediation, which was ignored. We further requested Lawyer Yu Chuanding to mediate, also without success. We were compelled to seek redress through the court but, out of consideration for the educational undertaking, requested that the evacuation and handover of the premises be delayed until the summer vacation of this year. This is the factual account of the matter. We respectfully request your esteemed newspaper to publish this correction.

Sincerely,

Star Perfume Factory

He received senior military officers, Wu Shaoshu (Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters), and Lu Entan (Representative of the Muslim Community). He then issued a written statement to reporters, stating: "I flew from Nanjing to Shanghai this morning (19th) at around 10:00 AM.

My aim is to ensure that all training units strictly adhere to the recently promulgated Army Education Order of the Ministry of Military Training, engage in practical training, acquire modern military knowledge, and become a精粹劲练 modern national army capable of shouldering the heavy responsibility of national defense and jointly maintaining world peace with allied nations. Furthermore, I would like to convey the Chairman's heartfelt condolences to all officers and soldiers who have demonstrated loyalty, bravery, and endured hardship during the eight years of the War of Resistance."

Inspection of Garrison Troops At 2:00 PM, General Bai went to Hongkou Park to inspect the New Sixth Army and the Youth Army's 207th Division, which had been placed under the command of the New Sixth Army.

He is scheduled to address the artillery regiment and the motor transport regiment today. Furthermore, it is reported that General Bai, as Chairman of the China Islamic Association, will be welcomed at a grand reception held by the Muslim community in Shanghai in the coming days.

### "National Construction Requires Building Tobacco Industry" - General Bai Chongxi's Inspection Speech

General Bai Chongxi, after arriving in Shanghai yesterday, inspected the New Sixth Army and the Youth Army in the afternoon and addressed all officers and soldiers. The main points are as follows:

The eight-year War of Resistance has finally achieved victory. This is due to the effective leadership of the commander-in-chief and the success of the war-resistant decision-making, but it is also due to the struggle and sacrifice of all our officers and soldiers and the Allied forces, and the victory won with blood and heads. This is a major outcome in this World War that cannot be erased. We have won victory after eight years of bloody battles, but after victory, there are still many difficult problems in front of China. We must complete the work of building the army and the country. To build a modern country, we must build

Modern Army The chairman showed us that to build a modern army, we must: (1) Thoroughly implement the three words "new," "fast," and "real." We need new equipment and new training. Use "soldiers are expensive and fast," the army must be mechanized. We must do it in a down-to-earth manner, we must be "real," not superficial. (2) Modern army is built on science. In the future, I hope that every officer and soldier will study more in academic aspects. (3) Strict discipline, and (4) compliance with the law.

In addition, the New Sixth Army will soon be ordered to go to the Northeast to take over the defense. There are still many reefs in the Northeast. After the New Sixth Army arrives in the Northeast, it must take on the heavy responsibility of protecting the Northeast and protecting China's national defense. The 207th Division is an intellectual youth army, and the chairman attaches great importance to young people joining the army

Very important Recently, the Ministry of Political Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Military Training, and relevant ministries have decided in a meeting that the Youth Army will receive reserve officer education. If we want to mobilize the whole country and implement a full-scale war, we must quickly establish a reserve officer military system. Therefore, I am preparing for a national mobilization. We must prepare a large number of cadres. The 207th Division is the first phase of reserve officers and a new era in Chinese history.

Finally, General Bai said that when I was ordered to go to Nanjing this time, the chairman instructed the wooden people to convey to you everything he usually said to the troops. The chairman cannot come to every place to inspect because of official duties. I would like to extend my condolences to you on behalf of the chairman.

### US Troops in China Will Gradually Decrease - Establishment of Advisory Group Awaits - General Wedemeyer Holds Press Conference

[Report from our newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the US China Theater, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Cathay Hotel on the eighth floor at 11:30 AM yesterday.

Continue to Maintain Designated Policies

Regarding the issue of repatriating US troops from China, General Wedemeyer stated: The US China Theater Command and its affiliated teams, officers, and soldiers will continue to perform their duties in China in the current months. When a reporter asked whether the China Theater was preparing to reduce the number of troops stationed in accordance with Washington's recent decision, General Wedemeyer replied that the China Theater Commander intended to continue to maintain the necessary number of people and troops in China in order to implement the policies designated by Washington. General Wedemeyer also stated that after the discharged soldiers were sent back to the United States, other soldiers would be transferred from the United States to China to replace them. However, it is currently unlikely that the total number of US troops in China will increase. Another reporter asked how Washington's recently promulgated demobilization order would affect the number of US troops stationed in China. General Wedemeyer replied that the number of US troops stationed in China would gradually decrease in the future to form a military advisory group stationed in China.

General Wedemeyer answered reporters' questions regarding the reasons for the delayed establishment of the US military advisory group in China, saying that the United States and China or other countries were in the same situation during this war. That is, many more important domestic and international problems must be solved, and under the pressure of time, slightly less important problems have to be delayed.

Don't Overemphasize Demonstration Movements

A reporter asked: This time the Chinese students' demonstration movement is purely due to other reasons, but some US military personnel believe it is an anti-American movement. I wonder if the US military headquarters has received an explanation from the Chinese authorities? General Wedemeyer said: I have not received an official or non-official statement from China. However, the US Stars and Stripes newspaper published an article last Friday, pointing out that this demonstration movement is not anti-American. General Wedemeyer and the wooden people believe that after every war, there will inevitably be such demonstration movements all over the world, and we don't have to take them too seriously. The scale of these various demonstrations is larger than before, because the scale of this war is larger than before. This is an expression of public opinion and should not be suppressed by force. However, if anyone goes beyond its scope and disrupts order, the authorities will have to intervene.

Cooperate to the End Before and After the War

Last week, a newspaper reported that a Class A war criminal was arrested by the US military authorities. Several Russians in this city were also abused by the Japanese criminal when they were previously imprisoned in the Qiaotou Building, and they demanded that he be sentenced. However, according to the US authorities, the US will only handle incidents of abuse of US troops, and accusations from other countries will not be controlled. General Wedemeyer stated that this was not true. The United States and other allied countries cooperated during the war, and they should also cooperate after the war to achieve world peace. If they do not cooperate with each other, they will not be able to implement the peace plan stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Mr. Wei decided to deal with this matter in accordance with the regulations on war criminal investigations.

Request the Chairman for Permission to Cover News

Regarding the fact that US reporters went to work in the Shenyang area, but the Cao Chinese authorities refused, saying that the Soviet Union did not want the beauty to go, but the Central News Agency reporters can still pass. They hoped that General Wei could assist them. Mr. Wei said: I not only hope that American reporters can go, but also that all other countries' reporters can go to work in the Northeast together. I will send a telegram to Chairman Jiang this afternoon to request permission.

Trip to North China Temporarily Postponed

When a conflict occurred, General Wei said that he had sent a letter to Mayor Qian, expressing his willingness to continue to cooperate with the Chinese authorities. Because the previous cooperation was very good, and we should strive to maintain it in the future. Although the Chinese administrative authorities may have made mistakes in the past, or may make mistakes in the future, he himself greatly admired and praised them for being able to manage this large metropolis with a large population with very little experience and achieve such good results.

The date for the trial of Japanese war criminals has not yet been decided, but newspaper reporters should be allowed to attend at that time. Also, when Marshal Marshall will come to Shanghai is not yet known. After the marshal arrives, a press conference will be held.

Because General Wei has been busy with official duties recently, his trip to North China is bound to be delayed.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Authorities to Revise Income Tax Law

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to request that the current income tax law be re-revised, cabled the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday. It should be requested that the current situation in the recovered areas and the changes in currency value over the past few years should be taken into consideration, and it is necessary to re-revise it urgently. In addition, the method of tax collection in the recovered areas should also be simplified and revised.

### Military Vehicle and Motorcycle Collide - Stray Bullets Injure People

[Report from our newspaper] At about 4:15 pm yesterday at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, three military trucks came in a row. Suddenly, a machine-powered military vehicle in front stopped moving when the red light was open. The two armies collided, causing the motorcycle to overturn slightly. The soldiers on the truck擁下反將揪住痛毆 and fired several guns, and a stray bullet hit the chest of Xu Yonglin, a driver in another car, and the situation was very serious. After the police on duty sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, although the doctor tried to remove the bullet, his life was in danger. It was later learned that the injured was a driver from the Central Bank.

At around 11:00 pm last night, a black-brand car with the number 11761 was speeding along the gate of the Songhu Garrison Command on North Sichuan Road, knocking down a top-ranking soldier, Yao Changxing, breaking his nose. The police from the Hongkou Branch drove the car that caused the accident into the branch, and the injured was taken to the hospital for treatment.

### Resolution of the French Tram Workers' Strike - Full Service Resumes Yesterday - Employers Give Bonus of 10,000 Yuan Per Person

[Report from our newspaper] The French Tram Company has been on strike for four days. After mediation by the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers, in order to take care of the overall situation, convened a general meeting of all employees yesterday morning and accepted the mediation. The negotiations were completed at 10:30, and all trams and buses resumed service on all lines at 11:00. The terms are that the employer will pay each worker a prize of 10,000 yuan, and each person will be paid 5,000 yuan for the four days of the strike. The remaining conditions will be discussed later.

Reported Cases Transferred to the High Procuratorate

The employees reported to the company's general manager, Jules Claes, that he had presented the Japanese side with 15 buses, 5 large engines, and a large number of gasoline, diesel, tire, etc. during the fall. This case was originally scheduled to be heard at 1:00 pm yesterday. Seven employee representatives arrived on time, but Jules Claes was not summoned. It was not until 3:15 that the prosecutor asked him and said that the nature of this case did not fall within the scope of the Procuratorate's Office of the Local Court, and that he would report to the High Procuratorate. The workers still intend to continue to report to the High Procuratorate and post slogans, demanding that the government take over the French water and electricity companies into state ownership.

Mr. Ge Kexin Makes a Statement

Yesterday, Deputy Director Ge Kexin of the Social Affairs Bureau made a special statement on this case as follows: After investigating the demands made by the workers this time. (1) The wage issue, the city will decide on a unified method to increase or decrease with reference to the cost of living index. (2) The year-end bonus has been handled by the company as usual and should not be required again. This kind of extraneous branch is really wrong. As for the workers’ reporting to the government, they should comply with legal procedures and submit documents and ask the judicial authorities to verify them, and should not be discussed together. The company’s unauthorized interruption of the current without the approval of the authorities is also inappropriate during the mediation period of the bureau. In short, regarding labor-management disputes, the municipal council has decided that they should be handled in accordance with the Law on the Handling of Labor-Management Disputes. During the mediation period, both labor and management shall not strike, slack off, or suspend business. In the future, the city will not allow the same incident to happen, and we will strictly ban it.

### Two Traitors Who Harmed American Officers Are on Trial

[Report from our newspaper] Zou Wenxian, 37 years old, is a native of Shishan. Shi Huiyao, 62 years old, is eight miles from Haimen. Both live in the Baoshan County. Recently, the Procuratorate of the High Court prosecuted them in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Lv Zou was slightly familiar with Japanese. From 1938 to 1943, he worked as a translator in the Baoshan Enemy Propaganda Class. Shi served as the captain of the pseudo-guard team in Baoshan County from October 1940 until the victory. One night in February 1942, two American military officers and a translator surnamed Liu escaped from the concentration camp set up by the enemy army in Yangxing Town and took refuge in the home of Li Lansheng, a villager, waiting for the night to come. Unexpectedly, the incident was leaked and discovered by the neighbor, who told Zou Wenxian, who reported it to the enemy liaison officer Oshima and Shi Huiyao. The guard team rushed to search for the two American military officers and Liu, and then handed them over to the Wusong enemy gendarmerie for detention. After learning of the incident, our Su Zhejiang Pioneer Army Songhu Mobile Corps arrested the two defendants after the victory, sent them to the Garrison Command, and then transferred them to the Procuratorate. The defendants confessed to having held pseudo-positions. The case was opened in the special criminal court of the High Court yesterday morning by Judge Zhu Zonghai. The two defendants hesitated in their confessions, denied that they had led the arrest of escaped Allied forces, and asked lawyers Yao Xichao and Liu Shichao to defend them. Then they asked the storytellers Li Lansheng and Li Azhen and his wife to prove that two allied soldiers and one Chinese were hiding in their wood shed and were later captured by the Japanese. The court ordered the defendants to be sent back to prison and rescheduled for further interrogation.

Wang Shiliang's Case Re-trialed

Wang Shiliang, a former printing worker of the Sino-American-Japanese Daily, served as an informant of the enemy's Shanghai East Gendarmerie after the Pacific War. He secretly reported the arrest of Xu Zhong, a member of the Chuan Democratic Youth League. He was released after the victory, and Wang Shiliang was reported and arrested by the authorities. The case was retried by President Liu Yugui yesterday morning. The perpetrator still refused to tell the truth. Then he asked the victim Xu Zhongchang, who was brought to the case, to confront him. The perpetrator had lowered his head and remained silent. The court decided to investigate and interrogate again, and the defendant was sent back to prison.

The Prosecution of Li Ze by Jian Ju has been Filed

Yesterday, a reporter visited the First Patrol Team of the Salt Inspectorate. Regarding the case of Shu Yueqiao reporting the traitor Li Ze, the team has conducted repeated investigations and obtained a lot of gains, and testified to the progress of the plaintiff Shu Yueqiao's report and prosecution. After comprehensive investigation, the processing procedure of the wooden case is still in compliance. Now that the preliminary investigation by the High Procuratorate has been completed, a public prosecution has been filed and the case can be tried according to law within days.

Interrogation of Chang's Unrighteous Conduct Completed

After the victory, Zhang Tao, the president of the pseudo-Supreme Court, was arrested by the authorities in mid-September. His sons, Su Chang, Su Kang, Su Xing, and Su Ding, fled to other places and hid. Su Xing had just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin recently. At 11:30 am on the 17th, he was arrested by the police from the Dising Road Police Branch at the intersection of Henan Road and Tianjin Road. According to the confession, he is from Hangzhou and is thirty years old. He studied at Daxia University and lived at 693 West Aimes Road. He once served as a "pseudo-municipal legal advisor." At that time, he was recommended by Sheng Youhui and concurrently served as the chief inspector of the Hongji Shantang (selling opium) to check private soil. There are also more than 400,000 deposits in the China and other banks. It is reported that the other two brothers of the rebel, Su Kang, and the brother Su Ding, are both colluding with the Japanese and are doing all kinds of evil. The four rebels each drove a car in the enemy era and went in and out of international hotels such as New Asia, behaving luxuriously. The police station has completed the interrogation and has transferred them to the High Court for punishment. Shen Jiucheng's son Wanling, the general manager of Shengsheng Ranch, was also sent to the criminal court of the High Court for interrogation yesterday.

The ship's equipment is still in wartime configuration, and wartime equipment such as gun emplacements must be dismantled. Because it is a cargo ship, there are very few passenger seats, and it will need to be refitted in the future. The sailing route has not yet been assigned. The handover procedures will take some time, as there is a large amount of equipment on board that needs to be received one by one. There are also three Victory Ships and six Liberty Ships waiting to be handed over.

### Opium and Drug Poisoning in Recovered Areas Must Be Eradicated within Six Months

The Central Government believes that in the recovered areas, during the enemy puppet period, the establishment of Opium Prohibition Bureaus, the public sale of opium, and the encouragement of people to smoke were blatant, causing great harm. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior drafted "Measures for Eradicating Opium and Drug Poisoning in Recovered Areas," which were approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation. In all recovered provinces and cities, regardless of whether people plant, transport, sell, smoke, manufacture, or store opium and drugs, all must be completely prohibited within six months from the date of the announcement.

### More Than 5,000 Factories Have Resumed Electricity

### Gas Ration Increase to 45 Cubic Meters

Due to the shortage of other fuels in the city, the original quota of 20 cubic meters of gas per household was insufficient. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau instructed the gas company to improve its methods. The new method has been approved, stipulating that the price of gas be calculated at 190 national currency units per cubic meter (100 cubic feet) according to cost, and the limit per household be increased from 20 to 45 cubic meters. The over-limit price will be reduced by 50% as originally stipulated. That is, for residential users, the charge is 4 national currency units per cubic meter (originally 800 national currency units per cubic meter). For industrial users, the charge is 750 national currency units per cubic meter (originally 1,500 national currency units per cubic meter). Therefore, although the unit price has increased by 90% compared to the original quota, the burden on users is actually reduced. Taking a consumption of 45 cubic meters as an example, according to the old method, the basic quota was 20 cubic meters, and the remaining 25 cubic meters should be calculated at the over-limit price, requiring a total payment of 12,000 national currency units. However, under the new standard, only 8,550 national currency units are required. This method is approved to be effective from January 4th of this year.

### China Railway Management Committee Announces the Current Situation of the Shanghai Railway Area and Limited Vehicles Maintain Trunk Line Transportation

The China Central Railway Management Committee yesterday announced its work situation and the general railway situation over the past three months as follows:

The Ministry of Communications believes that railway transportation cannot be delayed for a moment. The original principle for assigning personnel to take over railways in various regions was to temporarily maintain the business areas under enemy puppet management for separate takeover and management. Less reorganization of business institutions means less delay in the continuation of traffic. During the enemy puppet era, the Central China Railway Company administered the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou line, the Nanjing-Wuhu section of the Jiangnan line, and the Hangzhou-Zhuji section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. It had four bureaus in Shanghai, Nanjing, Bengbu, and Jinhua. After the takeover, adjustments were made according to this business area. The Central China Railway Management Committee was established, and the bureaus were abolished. The committee has departments such as transportation, engineering, and factory affairs directly managing the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Separate general managers were set up for the Pukou-Xuzhou-Hangzhou-Zhuji-Southern sections to manage the affairs of the entire section under the committee's direction. The Beijing-Wuhu section was returned to the Jiangnan Company for independent management. Among the lines, the Beijing-Shanghai line is the most important and the most watched by society. Now that the Ministry of Communications has completed the takeover of all railways, it will divide the national railways into nine major regions, which will be implemented soon. Regarding the general situation of the Beijing-Shanghai region and the Beijing-Shanghai line, the following is added.

Rectification Process Before the takeover, the two lines were in chaos, the stations were corrupt, black hats humiliated passengers, and baggage handlers filled the tops of cars, fully demonstrating the state of affairs when the Japanese invaders were about to be defeated. Everyone knew about the abandonment and chaos. As for the maintenance of the tracks and the maintenance of locomotives, some Chinese may think that the Japanese had advanced technology and took things seriously, so there must be something to see. But in fact, it was far from the case. Before the war, the Beijing-Shanghai express train originally took five and a half hours. However, the puppet "Central China Railway" paid no attention to the necessary work to maintain traffic, such as the annual allocation of funds to replace railroad ties. Most of the railroad ties were damaged. Unless one-third of them, or 160,000, were replaced, the pre-war driving speed could not be restored. If the railroad ties were not replaced first, increasing the speed would be dangerous.

As for the two most important things related to locomotive maintenance and coal economy: (1) hot water boiler washing, and (2) clean water supply, the puppet "Central China Railway" completely abandoned them and turned a blind eye. Each water supply station on the two lines originally paid great attention to using "soft surface water," that is, river water that had not been in excessive contact with the soil. Its calcium content was very low, and there was less hard scale in the boiler tubes. Hard scale in the boiler tubes not only hinders heat transfer and increases coal consumption but also increases the local temperature of the boiler tubes and shortens their life, which is the greatest enemy of locomotive maintenance and coal economy. Taking Nanjing Station as an example, before the war, the coal port was dredged every year, and river water was used to maintain a clean water source for the locomotives. Since the occupation, it had not been dredged for eight years, and it was completely silted up. The river source was cut off, and turbid Qin Huai hard water was used. Therefore, at the beginning of the takeover, not only were things chaotic in terms of order and personnel, but also in terms of track, locomotives, and vehicles, technology and maintenance were in a complete mess.

Thirty days after the takeover, a personnel reform was launched, and the most inferior black hats, numbering in the thousands, were dismissed in one day, which was welcomed by society. All order restoration work could be carried out smoothly. The chaos and dirt of the past have become a thing of the past. Hot water boiler washing and water supply projects are also being actively carried out. However, due to the extreme shortage of locomotives and passenger cars, passenger transport congestion has not been reduced. The 160,000 railroad ties must come from overseas, so it is impossible to restore the pre-war driving speed for a while.

The puppet "Central China Railway" was derelict in its duties, and there were very few trains. After Commissioner Chen Bozhuang was ordered by Commander-in-Chief He on September 20 to implement military takeover, he immediately increased the number of trains. One pair of fourth-class trains was added to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to alleviate the baggage handler situation. One pair was also added to the Shanghai-Wuxi section. After the official establishment of the committee on October 1, although military transport was extremely busy, the number of trains continued to increase. Before the Beijing-Shanghai line was taken over, there were ten trains a day, and now there are eighteen. Before the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was taken over, there were four trains a day, and now there are eight. The Beijing-Shanghai Road was already the busiest road for passenger transport before the war. After the victory, due to various reasons, passenger transport exceeded 44% of the pre-war level. Although all existing vehicles are now in use, they are still in short supply. At present, the average number of passengers carried by each vehicle is equal to two and a half vehicles before the war, creating congestion at the stations and in the cars. If you want to restore the old appearance, a large number of new vehicles must be imported, which is beyond the capabilities of the road administration. The statistics for Beijing-Shanghai passenger transport in the past three months compared with before the war are as follows:

The current authorities have requested the Ministry of Communications to quickly allocate locomotives and vehicles in accordance with the relief plan, so as to restore the old appearance as soon as possible and seek improvement.

Improving Treatment All transportation employees have suffered from low wages since the war of resistance, especially railway employees, because the railway income and expenditure are too incomparable, so their salaries are thinner than other transportation industries. The current standards for railway staff and technician treatment set by the Ministry of Communications are quite different from the cost of living in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The reasons for this are: (1) The treatment standards are based on the conditions of the Yuehan, Xianggui, and Longhai roads. (2) Any administrative or business agency's treatment methods always lag behind actual price changes, not just the railways. Moreover, due to regulations, there are often situations where we seek methods in the absence of methods and cut our feet to fit our shoes. In particular, the fact that the wages of railway technicians cannot be increased to 60 times that of the staff makes the Beijing-Shanghai authorities feel difficult. When the takeover was in October, the Minister of Communications personally instructed that living expenses should be temporarily issued and handled in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated treatment after the Ministry's treatment was promulgated. In November, when the Ministry's promulgated measures were received, it was deeply felt that they were too divorced from the actual situation. On the one hand, living expenses were issued five times in three months. On the other hand, the implementation of the Ministry's regulations was carefully studied. The Ministry's regulations divide technicians into three grades: A, B, and C. Not only are there too few grades, but the total allowances calculated according to the regulations are only more than 14,000 yuan at the highest. Among the staff, the class of affairs is the most numerous, but it is only more than 18,000 yuan, which is not enough for actual needs. Therefore, it was resolutely decided to temporarily set a temporary subsidy outside the Ministry's regulations. In addition to submitting it to the Ministry for verification, it was immediately released. For example, this temporary subsidy has been approved by the Ministry. However, the calculation methods used in the Ministry's regulations are always too trivial and difficult to match reality. It is heard that a new case of employee treatment will be proposed at the Railway Conference.

Current Plan The principle adopted in the division of national railways into nine regions this time is the trunk line system. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Region includes Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Jiangnan-Nanjing-Jiangxi, a total of four lines before the war, connecting the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. In the east, it is the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou, and in the west, it is Guixi in Jiangxi, connecting to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road. From Shanghai to Guixi, it will be a trunk line in the Beijing-Shanghai region, connecting to the Yuehan in the south, Xiangqian in the west, and Sichuan in the north. Before the war, the Beijing-Jiangxi line had been built to Huizhou, and the earthwork and stonework engineering from Huizhou to Guixi had also been completed by 80% to 30%. The sections of this area that were dismantled by the enemy puppets include the Ningbo section, the Sujia section, and the Jiangnan-Nanjing-Jiangxi section, leaving only the Nanjing-Wuhu section. Now, the Jingguo Road and Danglu Road have been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to plan the rehabilitation and reconstruction plan of this region, which will be submitted to the Railway Conference in the near future. It is heard that the general outline is: (1) Restore the equipment and driving speed of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines before the war. (2) Repair the Jiangnan-Nanjing-Jiangxi line to Guixi this year, making it a transportation line for repairing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road within Jiangxi Province, so as to promote traffic rehabilitation and rescue material transfers.

Movies and Drama

### Domestic Costume Films and Local Drama

— Tang Shaohua

A strange thing becomes ordinary when people get used to it.

But if we feel uncomfortable with ordinary events, we can turn corruption into magic. Others are accustomed to it and feel at ease, but we think it is extremely strange.

New novels were not popular yet, and everyone was reading old novels about talented scholars and beautiful women. So the men learned to write poetry, drink, and visit prostitutes, thinking it was the style of famous scholars - famous scholars and talented scholars were the same in essence but different in name. Melon-skin hats, silk jackets, double-nosed satin shoes, white socks, and most importantly, a ribbon tied around the ankle, walking around like a worldly gentleman. The women had to stay in their boudoirs, only allowed to peek behind the window, parting a slit in the bead curtain, looking for talented scholars passing by on the road during the day. If they took a fancy to someone, they would "accidentally" drop a fan or a poem, and meet in the back garden. But when they met, they had nothing to say, wiping away tears and going back to write poetry.

When new literature emerged, talented scholars and beautiful women also followed the revolution. Poetry was changed to new poetry, wine was changed to champagne and brandy... The most complicated change was the psychological reform, with roses replacing red beans as a symbol of love; the back garden was also confiscated and turned into a park. Meetings in the park were not just about moonlight and tears, but sometimes also involved kneeling (in the foreign style), hugging, and kissing. The ideal beautiful woman was not pale and melancholy, and the talented scholar also changed into a suit, along with the posture that should accompany the suit.

Speaking of this new posture, translated novels have never explained it clearly. To learn, fortunately, there are Hollywood movies.

New novels cultivated the "modern" psychology of new talented scholars and beautiful women; and imported movies guided the appearance of new youth. So those who had never been abroad had a more skilled way of holding knives and forks than real foreign old women, and the beautiful women sometimes learned incorrectly, such as wearing a white fox coat for a high-class evening party during the day, and eating snacks with a talented scholar in the dusty streets...

If you get used to these, they are not surprising; because everyone reads the same novels and watches the same movies.

One day, when you walk into a group of people who have not seen these movies and novels, you will be surprised by the different postures of their movements. These different postures are truly indescribable. For example, winking, pointing at something with the index finger extended, while the little finger also extends; twisting the waist and wiggling the buttocks when happy or unhappy, biting the corner of the handkerchief on the lips, peeking at the toes with the corner of the eye...

These postures may have been passed down from the grandmother, but where did the grandmother learn this look? If you get used to it, it's not surprising, so no one cares about it.

Occasionally, when you step into a local opera theater, you see many hermaphroditic historical figures on the stage (because it's a historical drama). Their movements, postures, and voices are exactly the things of the grandmother's generation. Because of local opera, we naturally think of domestic costume films. Aren't those performed in domestic costume color films also the emotions of the grandmother's generation? Movies also have their disciples, and domestic costume films and local operas also have their disciples. Perhaps their schools are different, so the learning style (?) is also very different.

Which one is better? Everyone gets used to their own, so they don't find it strange anymore, and they are too lazy to care.

However, if you think the look of the grandmother's generation is not modern enough, I think that to improve domestic films and local operas, we must not only transform their content to make those psychological elements of talented scholars and beautiful women more realistic and stronger, and catch up with the times. At the same time, those twisted and grotesque appearances must also be thoroughly clarified to meet the requirements of the new national appearance.

As for giving roses and opening champagne, there are many people who write about new literature and film, so I won't say much here.

[End] The prevailing atmosphere "China Electric" Troupe General Assembly Record - Proverbs

### The Democratic Atmosphere

— A Maxim

The entire "China Electric" theater troupe has arrived, and several actors have also been recruited in Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 15th, "China Electric" held a general meeting, bringing together both old and new members to discuss all issues after arriving in Shanghai.

The location was the general management office of the Central Film Studio on Haig Road. Shortly after 2 o'clock, in addition to the Chongqing contingent staying at the Qiu's residence, the newly joined Shen Hao, Bi Yun Sally, Lin Bin, Lu Shan, Feng Zhe, Ying Yu, and Yang Yingwu also arrived one after another. The original screening room had been converted into a temporary conference room with a T-shaped conference table, white tablecloths, flowers, and plenty of delicious Western pastries, melon seeds, peanuts, and the like. More than 30 people were seated, rather squeezed together.

Zhang Junxiang, the secretary of the "China Electric" theater troupe, stood up first and announced the significance of convening the meeting. He began by saying, "We didn't originally plan to have refreshments, but some of the gluttons requested them, so we prepared some. Now that we have them, we must politely offer them, even though they are very simple!" Then, he got to the point, stating that the purpose of the meeting was threefold: "First, a group of new colleagues from Shanghai have joined our group. Mr. Luo may or may not know these people. Here, I would like to introduce these new colleagues to Mr. Luo. Second, our old and new colleagues can also get to know each other, which will make our work easier in the future. Third, in order to solve our living difficulties, adjust the monotony of life, and maintain a regular lifestyle, we used to have a living committee. In order to discuss performance matters and improve our artistic cultivation, we used to have an art committee. Now, firstly, the term of our original committee members has expired, and secondly, we have moved to a new environment. The organization and personnel need to be decided and elected here. Now, let's first ask Mr. Luo to say a few words to us."

Mr. Luo Xuelian, the overall head of "China Electric," who was sitting next to Zhang Junxiang, stood up in response. He was wearing casual cotton clothes, looking amiable and approachable, not at all like someone attending a formal meeting with a serious demeanor. He first asked Zhang Junxiang, "What do you want me to say?" Zhang Junxiang replied, "Say whatever you like!" Everyone burst into laughter.

Mr. Luo spoke casually, first saying that the "China Electric" team had arrived in Shanghai in scattered groups and that the journey had been very arduous. He expressed his condolences here. In addition, he welcomed all the new colleagues to join their group. Later, he considered it again and then said, "I would like to mention my style and approach in the future here. Perhaps that's what Mr. Zhang wants me to say!"

"First, I have no preconceptions about things. This does not mean that I have no direction. I do have a direction. I will do as much as I can. The 'China Electric' theater troupe was created when filming movies was impossible. We used the talents of film workers to engage in spoken drama. This approach was correct at the time, but it is no longer correct now. Film and spoken drama each have their own different characteristics. The organizational system and scope of work of the theater troupe should be completely separated from the film aspect in the future, and each should develop independently.

"Second, regarding technical aspects, how to divide them from film does not refer to stage equipment, lighting, and other technologies, but to the technology of separating from the film department. The theater troupe used to be attached to an organization. In the future, I hope, or rather, I will strive to make it professionalized. This means that it will no longer be like a government office. In other words, it must be able to be self-sufficient. I will provide you with all the conditions to achieve self-sufficiency. I don't need to make money, but I also don't need to lose money. If the theater troupe has a surplus, it still belongs to everyone. This means that the surplus of the theater troupe should be used to develop the theater troupe and to ensure the lives of everyone. When implementing this, I will bear the responsibility of solving various problems with you all, just like you. I hope that what I do, you will all do the same. Of course, if I am not good, you can tell me.

"Third, I must declare my own position. I am borrowing Mr. Wan Jiabao's words, I am a 'bridge.' I am willing to be a bridge. I will take all the responsibility, but to do it well, everyone must work hard. I have plans and deployments for all aspects of 'China Electric.' Regarding the Shanghai theater troupe, I hope that Mr. Zhang will take more responsibility. In fact, Mr. Zhang has already done so.

"In addition, let me mention that everyone or every group has strengths and weaknesses. I hope that everyone will do their best to develop their strengths. Moreover, it is not enough for each person to develop their own strengths individually. We must turn each person's strengths into the strengths of the theater troupe in order to stand firm. Everyone has had a good performance in the past seven or eight years, and it will certainly be the same in the future. Whether you are a new colleague or an old colleague, it is the same. To be honest, our theater troupe has a lot of hope."

After Mr. Luo finished speaking, Zhang Junxiang stood up again. He said humorously, "Mr. Luo is very busy and wants me to take more responsibility. Mr. Luo is the 'bridge,' and I am just the M.P. at the head of the bridge, watching over everyone as they pass by in cars, jeeps, and motorcycles."

Zhang Junxiang first introduced several people in the "theater troupe" who needed to be recognized for work purposes. Then, the stage manager Liu Housheng introduced the rest of the people who had come to Shanghai. Yang Yingwu introduced the newly joined members. Then, they entered the stage of discussing the establishment of a living and art committee. Mr. Luo left the meeting first.

In a warm and free atmosphere, it was decided that the "Living Committee" would still follow the old Chongqing system with slight modifications, collectively called "China Electric Village." All members of each troupe were members of the village, enjoying all rights and contributing all obligations. The highest leader of the entire village was the chairman, with units for secretary, medical affairs, library, social affairs, sports, and music under him. Zhang Junxiang was elected to the "Sports" group, but not as the natural chairman of "China Electric Village," which shows how democratic they were. Then, the art committee was elected. In addition to the standing committee members who were actually responsible for various aspects of performance work, there were also five village representatives who jointly decided on all artistic issues. These are only the internal details of "China Electric," and I will not go into detail here. However, this new atmosphere is quite enough for the reference of the theater and film industry.

### Wu Yonggang and Cai Chusheng Arrive in Shanghai One After Another

The famous directors Wu Yonggang and Cai Chusheng transferred from Hong Kong to the mainland during the Anti-Japanese War and served as directors at the Central Film Studio. They have recently arrived in Shanghai one after another. Both have families in Shanghai, so after arriving in Shanghai, they each went to their own homes. It is reported that both are actively preparing for the production of new works.

### "Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty"

— Niu Yi

In the mainland, Yang Cunbin's "Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" has been one of the most popular spoken dramas in recent years.

The first part of "Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty," "Emperor Guangxu's Personal Rule," uses the historical events of Emperor Guangxu's initial grasp of power and Empress Dowager Cixi's behind-the-scenes manipulation and autocracy as its subject matter. On the surface, it is somewhat similar in material to Yao Ke's "Qing Palace Grievances," which was performed in Shanghai, but the former narrates less about the romance between Emperor Guangxu and Consort Zhen and focuses more on expressing the political situation at the time, such as the "war" and "peace" factions regarding Japan, and the expansion of revolutionary forces. The tight and vivid structure and the skillful use of the Manchu vernacular are the highlights of the play.

It is said that "Hard Work" will soon stage this play, probably around the Lunar New Year after "Night Shop." The audience in Shanghai will also have the opportunity to appreciate it.

"Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" has many characters. Among them, the main characters such as Empress Dowager Cixi, Li Lianying, and Emperor Guangxu have been decided to be played by Danny, Shi Hui, and Zhang Fa, etc. It is said that Shen Min, who went to Chongqing, will also rush back to Shanghai before the Lunar New Year to participate in the performance. This is another piece of good news.

### Introducing "Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Skies"

— Fen

During the Anti-Japanese War, there was a most outstanding production in the rear, which was "China Electric's" "Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Skies." This film is the work of the poet-director Sun Yu, which narrates the birth, growth, and struggle history of the Chinese Air Force. It is a bloody and tragic poem. The actors include Bai Yang, Wang Renmei, Jin Yan, Wei Heling, Gu Er'yi, Shi Chao, Dan Ning, etc. The two copperplates printed here are two scenes from the film. Bai Yang, Jin Yan, and other red stars, who have been away from Shanghai for eight years, will soon be reunited with the people of this city in the city's two major theaters.

Social Services

### Clearing Debts Leads to Disputes, Only the Law is Considered, Not Personal Feelings

Editor: I have always admired your newspaper's social service column for answering questions for readers. I have a matter to ask about, and I would be grateful if you could answer it in your newspaper. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, I borrowed 200 legal tender from a wealthy household in my hometown (in the rear, non-occupied area). At that time, in addition to writing an IOU, I also mortgaged my ancestral property title deed, paying 2% interest per year, which I paid in full every year. In May of this year, I repaid five times the amount and paid the interest up to the end of the year, asking the wealthy household to return the IOU and the mortgaged property title deed. However, the wealthy household refused to return the IOU and the mortgaged property title deed, claiming that the amount was too small. I don't know what method I can use to clear this debt. Does the government have other regulations on how to clear debts borrowed during the Anti-Japanese War, or how many times should be added? If I must clear the debt and the debtor refuses to accept it and does not return the IOU and the mortgaged property title deed, what is the proper way to resolve it? I respectfully ask your newspaper to disclose it in detail so that the debtor may also know the details. Respectfully wishing you good health! Wang Qiang, a reader from Wuxing. The currency value is low. Creditors indeed suffer losses, and therefore may request compensation for damages. The court may handle this case with discretion, but there is no special law to provide relief. Since the principal and interest have been paid off, and you have offered five times the principal, but the wealthy household is using the IOU as collateral and refuses to return it, if there are no other disputes, you can resort to the law to seek relief. [Editor]

### Three Questions for the Post Office: Remittance to Huaguo Mountain Sinks to the Bottom of the Sea

Our newspaper reader, Mr. Hu Yingming, is requesting a public inquiry regarding the loss of a remittance, stating that he remitted 90,000 yuan in legal tender from the Shanghai Farmers Bank to Tunxi on November 19th last year. The remittance ticket was sent by registered mail at the North Fujian Road Post Office on the 20th. Three months have passed, but the return receipt for the registered mail has not been delivered. Therefore, he went to the post office to inquire and was told to write a blank envelope in the same way and send it to them so that they could investigate. However, another month has passed, and there is still no news. He has inquired at the post office once again, and was told that if there is definite news, he will be notified by letter. He thinks that he remitted the money to Hui because his family had an urgent need, and it is now approaching the end of the year, so how can he wait any longer? He has three questions that he hopes the postal authorities and the Farmers Bank will answer: [1] What responsibility should the post office bear for the loss of the registered letter? [2] When will there be definite news about the investigation? [3] If the money at the Tunxi Farmers Bank has not been fraudulently claimed, what procedure should be followed to claim it later, or how long will it take to be able to claim it? Hu Yingming, No. 16, Lane 423, Jinling East Road.

### Young People Want to Enter Normal School

Editor: We are a group of young people who are interested in education. We are first-year high school students at a private middle school in this city and are very interested in entering normal school to study. However, we do not know which school is better. Please introduce us to one and answer publicly in the newspaper. We have always admired your column for providing social services without any effort. We believe you will not refuse our humble question. Wishing you good health, students Wu Enlai, Zhang Qi, Jin Zijian, etc. [Answer] Shanghai Municipal Kindergarten Normal School and Xinlu Normal School both have very complete content and are suitable for further study.

Inquiry about Jiaoji Railway Registration Office

Dear Sir: A friend from another port has entrusted me to inquire whether there is a Jiaoji Railway Restoration Registration Office in Shanghai, as well as a receiving agency of a similar nature. I am writing to ask you to kindly provide an answer. Sincerely, Zhang Shikuan. [Answer] I have not heard of a Jiaoji Railway Restoration Registration Office in Shanghai. Please inquire with the Lianglu Administration Bureau or write directly to the railway bureau in Jinan.

Dear Sir, my relative studied at Lester Institute of Technology. After completing the second year of junior high school, he wanted to enter the original school for further study, but unexpectedly it was changed to East Asia Institute of Technology by the enemy and puppets. Helplessly, he had to continue his studies until it was dissolved shortly before the recent victory. The certificates obtained by the students of that school are all in Japanese. Of course, this is a puppet school, and there is no need to doubt it. However, the students of that school are all students of the puppet school. But the school is neither a puppet national school nor a puppet municipal school. There is no way to verify the academic status of the students of that school. If they apply to other schools, they will not be accepted. I think there are quite a few students studying at that school. Now, they have neither a proper job nor a chance to go to school. Lester has not yet been restored. Given this complicated situation, I would like to ask your newspaper for instructions. Shenbao reader Jie Min.

[Answer] Lester Institute of Technology was known to be very complete before the war. It is a pity that the environment is like this, and the students in the school are in a dilemma. It is regrettable! Now they are wandering in a wrong direction and suffering the pain of being out of school. I hope the students will elect representatives and petition the Education Bureau. There should be arrangements for the next semester. [Editor]
