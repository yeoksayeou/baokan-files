[Another Dispatch] It has been learned that a grand ceremony commemorating the return to the capital will be held on May 5th, and the first joint memorial week after the return to the capital will be held on May 6th, which will be personally presided over by Chairman Chiang.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 28th] After bidding farewell to the people of Sichuan in Chengdu, Chairman Chiang departed from Chengdu at 9:00 AM on the 28th. All officers and students of the Army Military Academy lined up to see him off. Amidst music, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by General Guan Linzheng, the Education Director of the Military Academy, left the Principal's residence and drove to the Fenghuangshan Airport outside the north of the city, taking off at 9:00 AM to return to Chongqing. Chairman Zhang of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Director Deng of the Pacification Headquarters, Chairman Liu of Xikang, Chairman Huang of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Speaker Xiang of the Provincial Assembly, and others all went to the airport to see him off. Although Chairman Chiang's visit to Chengdu lasted only three days, he gave many instructions regarding the educational facilities of the Military Academy and left a very deep impression on Sichuan. Chairman Chiang once said that Sichuan is a base for the War of Resistance and national revival, and he hoped that Sichuan would be built into a model province in the future. He also publicly declared his determination to take responsibility for promoting Sichuan's economic construction, as a foundation for the great cause of national construction. When he met with various military and government leaders, he also encouraged them to cooperate and work together to complete the construction of Sichuan, even saying that he regarded Sichuan as his second hometown and was willing to be a Sichuanese. Chairman Chiang also inquired about the current situation of cultural and journalistic enterprises in the city. Chairman Chiang is in his sixties, with gray hair, but he is in good spirits. He watched a Peking opera performance at the Military Academy late into the night, leaving only at the end of the show.

### Preliminary Northeast Peace Agreement Is Currently Being Drafted in Chongqing. Chairman Met with Marshal Ma at His Residence Yesterday.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Chongqing News: The Northeast negotiations between the government and the Chinese Communist Party, through Marshal Ma's vigorous mediation, have reached a decisive stage. If the ceasefire order can be issued on the 29th, Zhou Enlai intends to accompany Special Envoy Marshall on a star-produced plane to Nanjing.

[United Press, Peiping, 28th] Government authoritative sources pointed out that the preliminary peace agreement on the Northeast is currently being drafted in Chongqing by General Marshall and representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. They also stated that they still hope the agreement can be signed in Chongqing; otherwise, negotiations will continue in Nanjing. The Chongqing negotiations include the following principles: (1) Immediately cease the conflict in the Northeast; (2) Ceasefire before discussing any political issues; (3) The government should receive sovereignty over the Northeast (the government insists on this point).

[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] A formal ceasefire proposal is now being considered at Chairman Chiang's residence. If accepted, it could end the civil war. However, the government will therefore lose control of a large part of the Northeast. The Chinese Communist Party has agreed to this peace proposal. The exact conditions are being kept secret by all leaders. The proposal was drafted when Chairman Chiang returned to Chongqing from Chengdu. Chinese sources with inside information said that the Chinese Communist Party is willing to discuss terms more conciliatory than Zhou Enlai's demand for "unconditional ceasefire," but the government still needs to make great sacrifices. Some also say: "The Chinese Communist Party now occupies Changchun and Harbin. If the government wants to recover these cities, it can only do so through war. We believe the Chinese Communist Party will not give them up." Chinese sources reported that this peace proposal has been approved by Special Envoy Marshall, but Marshall's headquarters remains silent on the progress of its ceasefire efforts. The final decision on this proposal must be made by Chairman Chiang himself. This afternoon, Chairman Chiang held secret talks with Marshall at the Shantung (Mountain Cave) residence. The official residence has not indicated what Chairman Chiang's intentions are. A spokesperson for the Democratic League said: "The next 24 hours are extremely important. If a ceasefire agreement is not reached within this time, it may be delayed for a long time before consultations can resume in Nanjing."

### Contents of the Secret Agreement Between the Soviet Union and the Northeast Communist Army

[United Press, Peiping, 28th] "Yishi Daily" reported: "There is a rumor about a secret agreement signed between the Red Army and the Northeast Communist Army, containing a total of twelve points, including the Soviet Union providing military assistance to the Communist Army, the Communist Army assisting the Soviet Union in removing equipment from Japanese factories, and the Soviet Union's special privileges in Northeast mineral and industrial resources. The newspaper stated that this agreement was signed by ten representatives of the Red Army and Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Communist Democratic Allied Army, two months ago at the Benxi Henan Railway Station, 40 miles from Shenyang. People in the National Army believe that this news seems to be accurate, because since then, the development of events in the Northeast has been consistent with the various points mentioned. The contents of the above agreement are said to include the following points: (1) The Chinese Communist Party agrees that the Red Army should extend its stay in the Northeast as much as possible. (2) A local autonomous government should be established in the Northeast. (3) The Red Army will provide military fire and weapons to help the Communist Party. (4) The Red Army agrees that the National Army or the US Army will not land in Dalian or other ports. (5) The Communist Party agrees that the Soviet Union has special privileges in mineral and industrial resources in the Northeast. (6) The Communist Party agrees to turn the China Changchun Railway into the Red Army's "corridor." (7) The Communist Party agrees that the Soviet Union will remove all machinery and equipment from Japanese factories in the Northeast and agrees to assist. (8) The Communist Party agrees that the Red Army has the privilege of "free action" in various parts of the Northeast. (9) The Red Army implements special military training for the Chinese Communist Army. (10) The Red Army is helping the Communist Party organize autonomous governments. (11) The Red Army agrees that the Chinese Communist Army can enter Northern Manchuria from Southern Manchuria. (12) The Red Army agrees that if the Chinese Communist Army is defeated by the National Army in the Northeast, it can withdraw to Soviet territory. People in the National Army here said that Article 11 of the above agreement can explain the reason for the appearance of the Chinese Communist Army in Northern Manchuria, since until January, that area was still the sphere of influence of local Communists directly controlled by the Soviet Communist Party.

### After the Communist Army Captured Three Small Towns, They Attacked Nantong City Again. They Were Repelled by the National Army and Are Still in Fierce Fighting.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Military News: On the morning of the 28th, the Army Headquarters reported successively according to Chairman Wang and Commander Pan that Tao Yong, commander of the Eighth Column of the Communist Army New Fourth Army, led his 64th Regiment, 66th Regiment, 68th Regiment, 70th Regiment, 72nd Regiment, Special Service Regiment, and Guard Regiment, a total of seven regiments, and the Coastal Defense Column, about 20,000 people, attacked the two battalions of the 313th Regiment of the 105th Division stationed on the east side of Nantong on the night of the 26th. The National Army was caught off guard. Regiment Commander Guan Xiuwu was killed, and Deputy Regiment Commander Xu Renda and Battalion Commanders Shi Weizhong and Zhang Yubo were all injured. Casualties among the soldiers were quite large. Xiaohai Town, Guanyinshan Town, and Xingren Town were all occupied by the Communist Army. On the 27th and the morning of the 28th, the Communist Army attacked Nantong City and the Eighth Cotton Mill again, and were repelled by the National Army defending the city. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. In addition, a unit of 3,000 to 4,000 Communist Army soldiers is moving towards Haimen, attempting to attack the Third Cotton Mill. In addition, the Communist Army in the Fanchuan Town and Dinggou Town area northeast of Yangzhou and the Xuyi area on the east side of the southern section of Jinpu Railway have also increased their forces, with a great momentum of making trouble.

### North China Telecommunications Work is Struggling in Difficulties. The Director of the Telecommunications Administration Talks

[This Newspaper, Peiping, April 28th] North China's telecommunications are still struggling in difficulties. Nie Chuanshu, Director of the Seventh District Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications, told reporters today that the receiving work of North China's telecommunications has not yet been completed. As of now, the area occupied by the Chahar Province and the Communist Army has not been received in accordance with the ceasefire agreement and has not returned to normal. Even in Shanxi, only a few damaged machines have been received to maintain the most basic wireless communication. Other wired communications have been received by the provincial government. Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Pinghan and Jinpu lines have not suffered major damage again, but it is currently impossible to talk about restoring them to a normal state. The Jinpu Road currently only connects to Cangzhou, and the Pinghan Road telecommunications currently only connect to Shijiazhuang. Before the problem of railway repair is resolved, it is impossible to talk about telecommunications repair. There is no money for communication between Peiping City and Chongqing, Nanjing, and Shanghai, because there is only one machine, and the daily communication time cannot be increased either. Currently, the price fluctuations in North China are still severe, and the monthly income of about 200 million yuan is only one-third of the total income. If this continues for a long time, it is really unimaginable. In the former North China Telecommunications Department, there were more than 4,000 Japanese technicians. After receiving the department, the number has gradually decreased to more than 200, and it is planned to send them back to their country within a considerable period of time.

### National Congress Opening Still Requires Time. Registration Stops Today. Delegates Coming to the Capital in the Future Will Still Be Hosted.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After the postponement of the National Congress, it has been decided that delegate registration will stop from tomorrow. According to Secretary-General Hong Lanyou of the Preparatory Committee, registration is a procedure of the conference. Now that the conference has been announced to be postponed, delegate registration must be postponed according to law. However, delegates coming to the capital in the future will still be hosted and supplied by the Preparatory Committee. He also said that the government is currently busy returning to the capital, and the National Congress can only be convened after consultation, so the postponement is not a matter of ten days or half a month. Today, the Jiang'an ship arrived in the capital carrying 59 delegates from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, and they registered this afternoon, so it was crowded again. There were a total of 75 people registered throughout the day, including 25 vocational delegates, 8 selected delegates, and 42 regional delegates. The full list is as follows: Guo Heng, Wang Bingjun, Zhou Zhaotang, Liu Keshun, Zou Zhifen, Tang Guozhen, Wang Jun, Li Shizhen, Li Yaxian, Wang Zhongyu, Wen Chaoji, Zhong Boyi, Wang Zhentao, Huang Nengyuan, Xie Zuyou, Su Xianyang, Rao Diancheng, Xie Jixia, Liu Yuehou, Gan Zixian, Shi Honggui, Ma Changxu, Xiang Naiqi, Zhang Gai, Yin Dehu, Jiang Fusheng, Lu Zongyi, Zeng Shengqi, Wan Guojun, Xiao Jun, Miao Kunshan, Huang Jia Zhao, Xu Gang, Qiu Jianyuan, Cai Qian, Bai Yukai, Jiang Xiaorong, Huang Shiheng, Ge Qiying, Yi Pusheng, Liu Ziya, Mu Zibin, Liu Ce Cheng, Zhang Chengtao, Xiang Yujie, Huang Jiaju, Li Jianwen, Shu Ze, Cao Ying, Liu Wonan, Liu Zongduo, He Zhihuan, Lai Qingying, Wang Qinghua, Chuan Shao Xu, Yu Youqing, Su Cun, Chen Peng, Yu Shouzhen, Zhou Zhaolin, Duan Jidian, Huang Yuren, Wang Qijiang, Li Zhong'an, Wang Mingxuan, Wan Zhucun, Liu Fanguo, Yu Jiancheng, Xiao Xiang, Zhang Jianming, Wang Xiuchun, Cha Xiaoshan, Xiao Jishan, Zhu Yijie, Zhou Shushan.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] After the date of the National Congress was postponed by the National Government, the Preparatory Committee of the Congress also postponed the delegate registration procedures in accordance with the order. The delegate registration office originally set up at Xinjiekou will temporarily suspend work from the 29th. After the confirmed meeting date is re-established, a notice will be issued to handle it again. The National Congress Preparatory Committee originally scheduled to handle the auditing procedures for reporters from newspapers and news agencies from April 28th, which has been postponed due to the extension of the meeting date. Those who have applied for registration with written applications from newspapers will be registered by the committee, and they will be notified again when the date of the Congress is determined.

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 27th] The news of the postponement of the National Congress spread here, and the hope of compatriots who were displaced in various counties to obtain the wish to return to their hometowns as soon as possible through the opportunity of the National Congress obviously encountered another setback. The fellow villagers associations in the northwest counties of Shandong residing in Jinan recently sent a telegram to the Chairman of the National Government, firmly opposing the postponement of the National Congress due to the interests of a few parties.

### Resolving Labor-Capital Disputes. He Zhonghan Talks About Three Principles

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After arriving in Nanjing, Central Committee member and Director of the Labor Bureau He Zhonghan recently met with reporters from this newspaper. According to him, the tumultuous labor unrest has caused some trouble, which is an inevitable phenomenon after the war. However, the main cause of the so-called labor-capital disputes in our country is management problems, because in addition to economic reasons, there is also a political reason for labor-capital disputes in our country. Today, the demands of the labor side are nothing more than (1) increasing job opportunities, (2) increasing relatively reasonable wages, and (3) general welfare. The demands of the industry side are (1) capital accumulation, (2) ensuring production order, and (3) increasing production efficiency. The distance between the two sides is not difficult to approach, so the way to resolve labor-capital disputes in the future should focus on the following three points: (1) political stability, (2) using timely and appropriate plans to utilize manpower, and (3) stabilizing prices.

### National Government Orders the Promulgation of the Revised Land Law

### Fierce Fighting on the East and West Sides of Siping Street. National Army Surrounds Gongzhuling. Soviet Army Withdraws from Harbin and Qiqihar

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 28th] According to relevant sources, in addition to the fierce fighting between the National and Communist armies near Gongzhuling Prefecture, fierce fighting has also occurred in Zhengjiatun (ie, Liaoyuan) west of Siping Street and Hailong east of Siping Street. The National Army is now using Siping Street as a base to expand its left and right wings, forming a large encirclement of Gongzhuling. In order to coordinate the war in the Northeast, the Rehe side has been mobilizing frequently, and a large amount of medical supplies have been concentrated in Zhangjiakou and transported elsewhere. Ye Baishou, Lingyuan, and other places in Rehe have been calm and uneventful.

[United Press, Peiping, 28th] According to news from the "Xinsheng Daily" in Shenyang, because the National Army failed to capture Siping Street, it has adopted a roundabout tactic, and a vanguard team is approaching Gongzhuling, 35 miles south of Changchun. The "World Daily" said: The National Army is expanding westward and eastward from the Siping Street area to strengthen its two wings in order to advance further. At present, the National Army has advanced to Liaoyuan, 40 miles west of Siping Street, and Hailong, 90 miles east of Siping Street. Therefore, the front line has been extended to 130 miles, with Siping Street in the middle.

[Another Dispatch] Reliable neutral sources said today that in the Battle of Siping Street, which is still going on fiercely, the National Army captured a small number of Soviet soldiers. Three Soviet prisoners of war have recently been handed over by the National Army to the US representative of the Northeast Executive Group for repatriation. It is said that when questioned by the US representative, they admitted to being Soviet citizens, but firmly denied fighting side by side with the Communist Army. Two of them claimed that they were sent by the Red Army authorities in Dalian to purchase food, which was why they were blocked in Siping Street. One of them claimed to be a railway guard. However, the National Army claimed that all three were captured while fighting on the front line.

[Another Dispatch] It is reported that the National and Communist sides are vying for control of Andong City in southern Northeast China. This situation is developing rapidly. National Army news said that Gao Xibing, the chairman of Andong Province appointed by the government, is in Shenyang waiting to take office, but the Communist Party's "Liberation Daily" said: Gao Zhongming, the Communist Party's "publicly elected" provincial chairman, is already in the Andong Provincial Government. The National Army admitted that the National Army troops have not yet entered Andong.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] It is reported that the Soviet Army in the Northeast has withdrawn from Longjiang (Qiqihar), which shows that the Soviet Army is now fulfilling its promise to completely withdraw from the Northeast within the month. Reports said that since the 14th of this month, the Soviet Army has retreated 400 miles from Shenyang, which is two-thirds of the way back to Siberia.

[United Press, Peiping, 28th] Harbin and Qiqihar continue to control the news today. The Red Army began withdrawing from these two major Northeast cities three days ago. Brief news about the Chinese Communist Party's "Self-Defense Army" taking over has arrived in Peiping. In addition, there is no detailed news. Before the Soviet Army withdrew, the delayed National Army news issued to Harbin said: The Communist Party's Self-Defense Army has announced the magistrates of Qiqihar, the mayor of Harbin, and the officials, and said that they were all elected by public opinion. Well-informed Communist Party sources here said that these "publicly elected" officials have now taken office.

### U.S. State Department Spokesman Says China Policy Unchanged, No Plans for Further Statements in Near Future

[Washington, Agence France-Presse, 27th] A State Department spokesman stated today that the State Department does not intend to issue any further statements regarding U.S. policy toward China in the near future. Since former Ambassador to China Hurley's accusations to the State Department, the United States has clarified its policy objectives. At that time, on the eve of the departure of current Special Envoy to China General Marshall, the State Department announced that the United States would strive to encourage the Chinese people to freely unite within the framework of the National Government.

[Nanjing, United Press, 28th] Observers who predict that the Northeast war will intensify and escalate into a large-scale civil war are shortsighted and alarmist. Their views are difficult to reconcile with the following three major facts:

(1) The United States will only be willing to lend $500 million to China through the Export-Import Bank after the Chinese political situation stabilizes.

(2) President Chiang clearly intends to make concessions to small parties.

(3) The Chinese Communists (CCP) are eager to implement political democracy under a constitutional system.

If the United States had indicated that it would lend any amount to China without specifying that China should first seek domestic stability, then U.S. Presidential Envoy General Marshall could have packed his bags and returned home long ago. The only power the United States can exert on China is economic, and the U.S. government will certainly not use military force to support or suppress any party. This is well known in China and to everyone. Any individual who harbors such expectations is quickly met with public opposition and dares not entertain such thoughts again. Therefore, the U.S. promise to assist China if it restores peace is where U.S. influence lies. China cannot engage in foreign trade with the United States or other countries until it is at peace. President Chiang has decided to postpone the National Assembly to await the resolution of the disputes between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP. This is the second encouraging sign, as it leaves room for continued negotiations and acknowledges that the national situation has changed, and that other parties cannot be ignored. If President Chiang were to convene the National Assembly regardless of the absence of representatives from the CCP and the Democratic League, the prospects for civil war would indeed be bleak. The third factor is that the CCP is eager to organize a democratically elected government, but the situation is somewhat ambiguous due to the political competition supported by force in the Northeast. The crux of the problem lies in the statement made by the Second Plenary Session of the KMT several weeks ago in Chongqing, which opposed several important resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), provoking strong resentment from Yan'an. At the same time, the war in the Northeast has become increasingly fierce. If someone could guarantee that the resolutions of the PCC will be implemented, especially if President Chiang could provide such a guarantee, it would have the effect of clarifying the confused situation, which no other action could achieve.

### Repair Work on Shandong Railways Completely Halted, Repeated Consultations Yield No Results, Train Service Between Cangzhou and Botou Also Suspended

[Jinan, This Newspaper, 28th] The repair work on the Shandong railways has been completely halted. The replacement of the government and U.S. representatives on the Jinan Executive Headquarters reflects the development of the Shandong situation and marks the entry into a new phase. People here express gratitude to the former U.S. representative Lake and government representative Tu Xuwu for their efforts and express their best wishes, and they have great expectations for the future efforts of the new representatives, Colonel Davis and Colonel Wenze. According to qualified observers, the settlement of peace in Shandong depends on the developments in the next two months, but the key lies in the sincerity of the CCP.

[Jinan, This Newspaper, 27th] The issue of resuming repair work on the Shandong railways has been repeatedly discussed with the CCP, but no results have been achieved. The situation remains stagnant. Recently, the Jiaoji Railway in the area of Ershilifangtian and HamaTun has been severely damaged by the CCP army. People here express regret at this action by the CCP.

[Jinan, Central News Agency, 27th] The Jinan-Qingdao through-transportation service, which will be implemented on May 1st, will use a combination of train and bus: passengers will take a train to ZiheDian, then transfer to a bus to TanJiafang, then take a train from TanJiafang to Fangzi, then take a bus from Fangzi to Gaomi, and then take a train from Gaomi directly to Qingdao, the entire journey taking three days. The local railway bureau has already sent the combined transportation plan to the Executive Headquarters through the Central Region, to provide convenience for traveling passengers.

[Dajin, Central News Agency, 27th] The Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Su County to Botou had been temporarily opened after negotiations mediated by the Seventeenth Executive Headquarters. The government and CCP representatives had signed a temporary agreement to allow for initial operations, but this agreement expired on the 25th. Since the two sides remain far apart in their views, the railway bureau, for the sake of prudence, has announced the suspension of service starting today.

### CCP Troops Massing in Gaomi, Seemingly Preparing for War

[Nanjing, This Newspaper, 28th] The fact that the Shandong Executive Headquarters has had little effect after months of work is a cause of concern for all parties. The Shandong military and political authorities are implementing unified command and cooperation to maintain government-controlled strongholds and stabilize order. Due to disagreement with the actions of the CCP army and to avoid conscription, there has been a large number of desertions, causing overcrowding in government-controlled cities. Several cities, including Jinan, Dezhou, Liaozhou, Yanzhou, Tai'an, and Zhangdian, have been besieged by the CCP army for months, and the situation is dire with many people starving. The Shandong CCP army, totaling 400,000 men, except for those who have gone to the Northeast from Jiaodong, are all near the railway lines, with the main task of controlling the main force of the Eighth Army of the Nationalist Army on the Jiaoji Railway. Therefore, there have been repeated battles near Gaomi. The CCP army going to the Northeast is constantly transporting weapons back to Shandong. Many believe that the situation in Shandong is unlikely to last.

[Jinan, This Newspaper, 27th] It is reported that the CCP army is massing in Gaomi, seemingly preparing for an attack. The local people are very uneasy. It is also reported that the CCP army in various parts of Shandong is building fortifications, with a clear posture of preparing for war.

[Jinan, Central News Agency, 27th] The CCP army in Jiaodong has launched another force of over 4,000 men to attack the areas defended by the National Army. On the night of the 25th, over 4,000 CCP troops attacked the 3rd Battalion of the 308th Regiment of the 103rd Division and the security team near Zhangling, northwest of Gaomi. Zhangling was also surrounded by the CCP army and shelled, and the power lines were destroyed.

[Shijiazhuang, Central News Agency, 27th] (1) The CCP's Southern Hebei Brigade, with over 2,000 men, 15 light machine guns, and fully equipped rifles, is collecting grain and cotton in villages near the southwest thirty li of Shimen, and forcibly conscripting three young men from each village between the ages of 15 and 25 to receive training in Yin Village, Shanxi. (2) The CCP army in the vicinity of Huojia Village and Tongcun is attempting to prevent the outflow of legal tender (Fabi) and has established exchange offices to exchange border currency for Fabi. On average, 7 Fabi can be exchanged for 1 yuan of Southern Hebei currency, with the exchange rate based on the price set by the Southern Hebei Bank. The CCP army is using merchants to carry Fabi to Shimen to purchase cloth and dyes for military use.

### Admiral Fraser Declares in Beiping, Will Continue to Help Us Build a Navy, Will Go to Qinhuangdao Today to Board a Ship to Return East

[Beiping, This Newspaper, 27th] Admiral Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, met with reporters at the Six Nations Hotel at 5 pm on the 27th. The admiral of the British Navy was radiant and energetic, but due to his age, his pronunciation was no longer very clear. When asked about his opinion on the status of Hong Kong, he avoided giving a direct answer, only saying: The British army must participate in the occupation of Japan, and Hong Kong is an important bridge to complete this task. Regarding the construction of the Chinese Navy, he said: In the past, the United Kingdom has assisted the construction of the Chinese Navy, and will definitely continue to do so in the future. China does not need a large fleet like the United Kingdom and the United States, and a heavy fleet is sufficient. When asked whether the United Kingdom will continue to allow the United States Navy to use the Singapore naval port in the future, he replied. The U.S. Navy used the Singapore naval port during the allied operations, but the British Navy also used the Philippine naval port. Admiral Fraser said that he had visited Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shanghai, and Chongqing, but this was his first time in the ancient capital of Beiping, so he was very happy. On the 28th, he was invited by Mayor Xiong Bin to visit Wanshou Mountain and had lunch in the garden. On the 29th, he will leave Beiping for Qinhuangdao and return east on the original ship.

As for the specific methods of improvement, Sun did not make any statement. Sun continued to talk about the food problem, saying that the current surge in food prices is due to traffic congestion and poor management and regulation by the authorities. If transportation is restored and management and regulation are appropriate, there will be no panic about food shortages.

Sun replied: The Sino-Soviet Cultural Association Shanghai Branch is presided over by Mr. Yan Huiqing and is currently actively preparing.

### Modernization of Our Industry Requires American Assistance, Statement by Our Labor Representatives

[Cleveland, Associated Press, 27th] The representatives of China and India attending the meeting of the Steel Committee of the International Labour Office today both emphasized the hope of the two countries to develop domestic steel production as a prerequisite for China and India to achieve postwar industrialization and modernization. Chinese representative Bao Huaguo, in a separate meeting with a reporter from the Associated Press, stressed that China must start from scratch in steel production, mainly because the factory equipment in the Northeast has been lost. He continued, China may have to wait two years after the domestic political problems are resolved before China can begin effective steel production, but skilled labor, American machinery, and large loans are still needed to cope with the industrialization plan.

### Famine, Food, Nutrition

— Yu Songyun

Many places are currently experiencing famine. The impact of famine, from a distance and on a large scale, naturally also affects life in Shanghai. However, many people in Shanghai do not feel it, enjoying themselves as usual, making merry as usual. Therefore, a British journalist ridiculed us in a London newspaper, saying, "China is starving, Shanghai is dancing!" Frankly speaking, when we look at the large and small restaurants in Shanghai, filled with guests, with leftover food and scraps discarded everywhere, everyone cannot help but sigh: in famine-stricken China, there are still many people eating too lavishly!

I am not saying that all of Shanghai is like this. We know that at this moment in Shanghai, there are many people struggling on the brink of starvation, not far from the people in the disaster areas. But on the other hand, the unsparing consumption of food, even the waste of food, is also a very obvious fact.

Waste is not right, everyone knows that. But based on my experience in managing garbage in Shanghai, from the composition of the garbage, I have seen how many families not only discard leftover food and scraps at will, but also often throw away usable vegetables and fruits on the road. Poor women and children often rummage through these garbage heaps, searching for food to fill their bellies. If someone collects the waste, it can be considered "making the best use of everything," but if it is only discarded and not utilized, wouldn't it be "squandering the gifts of nature"?

Secondly, let's talk about consumption. I often feel that middle-class and above families always eat too much. Eating too much means that the digestive organs cannot absorb it, or even cannot accommodate it, resulting in not only uneconomical but also unhygienic results. The ancients said, "Do not eat to excess," meaning that eating too much is not good. However, the word "excess" does not have a proper standard. In the past, "filling the belly" was considered "excess," which was a meaning derived from sensation. Sensation relies mostly on habit, and habits vary from person to person. Some people are full after eating one bowl of rice, while others need three bowls to fill their bellies. Since the invention of nutrition science, we can have a scientific calculation of how much food a person should eat each day. We know that the function of food for the human body can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) providing energy, (2) constructing the body, (3) regulating physiology. Energy is generated from heat, and food is the source of heat. The need for heat, according to international standards, is a basic amount of 2400 calories per adult per day, with an additional 75 calories per hour for light work and 75 to 300 calories per hour for heavy work. Any food containing carbohydrates, protein, or fat can provide heat. Fat provides the most heat, followed by carbohydrates and protein. The former can generate 9. C calories when completely burned per gram, while the latter two can generate 4.0 calories. Secondly, in terms of constructing the body, what the human body needs is mainly protein and inorganic salts, especially protein. The amount of protein needed by each person each day varies with body weight and the quality of the protein they consume. If animal protein is used as the standard, an average of one gram of protein is needed per kilogram of body weight. If plant protein is used, an average of 1.5 grams of protein is needed per kilogram of body weight. Thirdly, in terms of regulating physiology, in order to make all parts of the body work together and resist aggression, we must ingest nutrients such as minerals, water, and various vitamins from food for regulation. In short, in order to maintain and develop life, we must ingest protein, fat, carbohydrates, certain minerals, water, and various vitamins. The purpose of diet, physiologically speaking, is to obtain these nutrients.

All these nutrients have certain requirements. The amount of nutrients needed by the Chinese people each day is shown in the table below. ,

(Table 1) Daily Nutrient Requirements of the Chinese People

Insufficient nutrients can lead to "malnutrition" in mild cases, and "starvation" in severe cases. We need a certain standard of nutrition, which requires a certain amount of food. This is one aspect. But what if we eat too much food, exceeding the nutrient requirements and providing nutrient items? First, digestive organs may develop diseases or mutations because they cannot accommodate too much food or cannot withstand excessive stimulation. Second, digestive organs cannot absorb too much nutrients, so the remaining nutrients will be excreted with waste. From a health point of view, such a diet is an unreasonable diet. From an economic point of view, consuming too much food in the mouth and wasting food outside the mouth is the same kind of waste!

Here, we can get a new explanation for what the ancients called "Do not eat to excess," that is, (1) fearing to burst your stomach, (2) fearing to waste nutrients.

Nutrients are contained in various foods, and the amount varies. Milk and meat are known as nourishing, and their nutritional value is quite high. However, the intake of nutrients cannot be limited to milk and meat. At the same time, other foods such as beans and vegetables also have high nutritional value. If properly combined, they can more than replace milk and meat. Now I can list the nutritional value of commonly used foods as follows:

(Table 2) Overview of the Nutritional Value of Commonly Used Foods (The absence of numbers in the table indicates that accurate numbers have not been obtained or that this substance is lacking)

To talk about nutrition, we do not necessarily have to eat big fish and big meat. The main thing is to properly match various nutrients. And what is said here is not a profound theory, but a simple fact.

"Behind the red doors, meat rots; on the road, there are bones frozen to death!" Those who have food to eat should think about the suffering of those who are hungry and starving; those who consume too many nutrients should save the nutrients that they cannot absorb themselves and leave a little material to maintain the lives of those who are hungry and starving. At this moment, famine victims in the disaster areas are crying out for food, and there are also general civil servants, teachers, students, and soldiers who are all pale and malnourished, and need proper relief. Jiang Tingfu, Director of the General Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Xu Kan, Minister of Food, have made such appeals. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson recently announced that he will order a 25 percent reduction in U.S. wheat consumption to relieve foreign famine. President Truman also said that the American people consume too much food and waste too much. The food wasted by the American people every day can feed the world's famine victims for a day. Therefore, he fully agrees with the recommendation to forcibly reduce wheat consumption by 25 percent in order to save the world from famine. This is truly the will and words of the benevolent. We of course welcome such a decision by friendly countries, but we cannot help but feel ashamed of the enjoyment and merriment of some Chinese people! "Do not eat to excess," friends who eat too much should pay attention to the fact that "overeating" will inevitably cause stagnation in physiology, and is also a kind of depravity in morality! Those who have something to eat should think of those who have nothing to eat; those who have something to eat should think of those who have nothing to eat!

Finally, let me say again: Eating should focus on nutrition, this principle is known to everyone. If nutrients are insufficient, we should try to replenish them, but if there are too many nutrients, we should also try to save them and transfer them to relieve the disaster and famine.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Agrees on Principles - Dividing the Remaining Italian Fleet - Soviet Concession Accelerates Conference

[United Press, Paris, 27th] The four foreign ministers held their third meeting at the Luxembourg Palace today and decided to allow Italy to retain its basic fleet (the tonnage has been decided). The remaining warships, after being distributed to Yugoslavia and Greece, will be divided by the four countries: the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France. The Soviet Union originally demanded one-third of the Italian fleet, but after three hours of discussion, it withdrew its original proposal and accepted the above provisions. However, the details of the distribution method have not yet been decided. Today's historic meeting was the most pleasant one yet. The four foreign ministers first discussed the simpler issues of the Italian treaty, such as the border between Italy and France, Italy's future defenses, and the disposal of its remaining ships. The American representative was reported to support the allocation of Italian ships to countries that had been invaded by the Mussolini government. British Foreign Secretary Bevin insisted that representatives from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg should be allowed to participate in the discussion of the Ruhr issue as spokespersons for the countries that had suffered German aggression. The Soviet representative, contrary to previous rumors, did not oppose including the Ruhr issue on the agenda, but did not advocate allowing representatives from outside the four powers to participate. The four foreign ministers' representatives were responsible for drafting the daily agenda. At this morning's meeting, the more troublesome issues of Trieste and the Italian colonies were temporarily set aside, pending the arrival of the investigative team's report. The largest of the fleet that Italy is allowed to retain can only consist of about four cruisers. After the distribution ratio of the fleet was unanimously agreed, the meeting discussed the Franco-Italian border issue without reaching any decision, which will be discussed at a future meeting. The meeting on Monday may not necessarily address this issue.

[United Press International, Paris, 27th] The Soviet Union has conceded its demand to obtain one-third of the Italian fleet today and has agreed to accept less than one-quarter at the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Soviet Union's compromising attitude has accelerated the progress of the meeting, raising hopes that the four foreign ministers may reach an agreement on the terms of the treaty to formally end the war against Italy and other smaller Axis countries.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Hopes for an agreement at the Paris Peace Conference have emerged, as the Soviet Union has indicated its agreement to take the same steps as the United States in the formal revision of the armistice agreement with Italy. It is reported that the Soviet Union's agreement to complete the Italian armistice is conditional on the United Kingdom, the United States, and France being willing to accept the armistice terms for Finland and the Balkan countries controlled by the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference recently discussed France's territorial claims against Italy. Opinions differed, and no agreement was reached, leaving it for discussion at a future meeting. , Two

### Soviet Representative's Secretary Fears Eavesdropping During Conversations

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] According to a French detective protecting the hotel where the Soviet representatives are staying: The attitude of the Soviet representatives seems quite secretive. We have been here for three days and feel more like suspects than police officers. The Soviet representatives never ask us questions, never ask us to accompany them when they go out, and immediately stop talking when we approach them, as if they are afraid of being overheard.

### Obstacles to Italian Peace Treaty Not Yet Removed

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] There are many difficulties in the Italian peace treaty being discussed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Of the 31 points for negotiation put forward by Bevin and Byrnes, only four have reportedly been placed on the agenda. The first point is the preamble to the treaty, which points out Italy's actions in the war. The second point is the issue of reparations, which has been decided to be first investigated by a committee of experts to assess Italy's resources. The remaining two points concern Italy's southern border and the port of Trieste, which can be discussed after the Four Power Boundary Survey Team submits its report.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] Hundreds of Allied experts are busy over the weekend drafting the Italian peace treaty. The main points are: (1) the Franco-Italian border issue, (2) issues related to U.S. territories such as Tripolitania, (3) the Italian reparations issue, (4) the disposition of Southern Tyrol bordering Austria, (5) the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia, including the disposition of the port of Trieste, (6) the future of the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea, and (7) the determination of Italy's naval strength. The four foreign ministers, who drafted the treaty in London, are believed to have raised these issues, but some of them have caused disputes between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The London Evening Standard's Paris special correspondent reported today: Byrnes hopes to complete the discussion of drafting the treaty within ten days at the Paris meeting, but it is doubtful whether this strict deadline can be met. However, Byrnes believes that if such a deadline can be met, there is still a two-week interval for representatives of 21 countries to convene a peace conference in Paris.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 27th] Regarding the issue of the affiliation of Southern Tyrol, Italy has sent a memorandum to the Paris Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, stating that if Italy loses Southern Tyrol, it will reduce its hydropower by 40 percent, lose all manganese ore for special steel, and lead to a shortage of timber in Italy.

### Bevin Returns to London to Meet Smuts

[Reuters, London, 28th] Reliable sources here say that the British Foreign Secretary wants to meet with South African Prime Minister Smuts. In addition to discussing the Empire's defense plan, South Africa's attitude towards Italy's African colonies may also be discussed.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] General Smuts, Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, arrived in London this morning by plane from Cairo. He will meet with Foreign Secretary Bevin. One

### Rumors of Fascist Secret Organizations Discovered in Italy

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 27th] It is widely rumored here that Fascist secret organizations have recently been discovered in Italy. Most of the leaders are former Fascist leaders, including former Fascist Party Secretary-General Dara-Tti and former Minister of Foreign Trade Li Gadi.

### Attempting to Break Deadlock in Security Council - Mexico Plans to Propose a Solution - Australian Representative Hodgson Resigns Due to Wife's Illness - Franco to Test "Public Opinion"

[United Press, New York, 27th] Soviet Representative Gromyko insisted in the Security Council that there was sufficient evidence for Poland's accusation that the Franco government was threatening world peace and harboring National Socialists and German war criminals, and demanded that UN agencies take immediate action. It is heard that his position has not changed. Mexican Provisional Representative Colina is trying to break the deadlock and plans to propose a solution to enable everyone to act unanimously. Colina has been contacting representatives of various countries based on the proposal of Australian Representative Hodgson. Apart from the Soviet representative, other representatives have more or less agreed.

[United Press, New York, 27th] Australian Representative to the United Nations Security Council Hodgson announced today that he has resigned from his position as representative due to his wife's illness (his wife currently lives in Paris). His successor will be Hasluck, and there will be no change in policy. Hodgson is scheduled to leave for Paris on the 28th.

[United Press International, Madrid, 27th] Reliable sources here said today that the Franco government will hold a national referendum on July 18 to ask the people whether they approve of Franco remaining as head of state. July 18 is the anniversary of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Franco's supporters are all withdrawing. Franco accepted the referendum because the authoritarianist Bèza in Argentina was recently able to be elected president.

### Argentina Loans to Spain

[United Press, Argentine Capital, 28th] Argentine Foreign Ministry officials stated today that the country will sign an agreement with Spain on Tuesday to loan 30 million pesos (US$7.5 million) to Spain for the purchase of food in Argentina.

However, given that the Franco government may be considering moving to the United Nations Security Council, diplomatic circles here expressed surprise that Argentina would negotiate a loan with it.

### First Batch of Cholera Vaccines Airlifted to China

[United Press, Washington, 27th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that UNRRA is continuing to ship 2,268,000 doses of cholera vaccine to China.

For the sake of caution, UNRRA has decided that the first batch of 2,280,000 doses of vaccine will be transported by a chartered passenger plane from San Francisco on Sunday. UNRRA will do its best to prevent the spread of cholera in the Guangzhou area, using the same methods as it used last year to assist Chongqing in preventing a serious epidemic.

### British Labour Party Annual Conference: Prime Minister Delivers Anti-Communist Remarks, Saying Their Seizure of Power is Unscrupulous, Obstructing the Future of Democracy

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] British Prime Minister Attlee addressed the Labour Party conference today, stating that the Communist Party is hypocritical towards democracy and is in fact the least democratic. Furthermore, in terms of the methods they adopt to seize power, they often only care about the ends and are unscrupulous, disregarding the standards of behavior that sustain civilized social life. I firmly believe that the Labour Party conference will reaffirm its opposition to those who do not endorse the party platform but wish to join the party.

Regarding British foreign policy, its main principle is to do everything possible to uphold and strengthen the authority of the United Nations. Foreign Secretary Bevin has expressed his constructive ideas on this matter. Every time he delivers a speech on diplomacy, you will find that he never forgets the economic background of political problems. We are currently working with others to solve many difficult problems inherited from the past, especially the problems of Palestine and India. We have led the world to accept the international trusteeship system, which is to place former mandated territories under international trusteeship. We hope that both the Netherlands and Indonesia can meet each other with sincerity and find a compromise solution. In short, in any part of the world that concerns us, we are doing our best to promote the freedom and democracy of others. This fact cannot be denied by any fair observer.

The Spanish Question: [Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] After delivering a speech at the Labour Party conference, the British Prime Minister answered various questions, saying, "I hope the Spanish people will quickly rise up and overthrow the Franco regime." When asked why British ambassadors to various countries are predominantly Conservative, the Prime Minister replied that the selection of British ambassadors is not based on personal political views. We employ the most outstanding and sensitive talents.

### Superfortress Conducts Scientific Tests: Exploring the Intensity of Cosmic Ray Radiation

[United Press, Washington, 27th] The National Geographic Society announced today that scientists aboard a specially equipped B-29 Superfortress will conduct an unprecedented study of atomic energy as manifested in cosmic ray radiation next month. They will fly four times at altitudes of 5,000 to 35,000 feet, starting from the northern United States and ending at the magnetic equator, measuring the intensity of cosmic rays. Scientists intend to explore the exact intensity of neutrons, which they believe are the first particles split after light rays enter the Earth's atmosphere. The lifespan of these neutrons is only a few millionths of a second.

### Switzerland and the Soviet Union to Restore Diplomatic Relations

### US Should Adopt Extraordinary Weapons to Defend Against Blitzkrieg Attacks: Eisenhower Outlines Future US Army Plans

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press] General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower departed Washington today to begin his tour of US military bases in the Pacific.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] US Army Chief of Staff General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower declared here, "In order to ensure security against blitzkrieg attacks, the United States should adopt extraordinary weapons and yet unknown weapons. The United States must also strive to establish the strongest air force, continue scientific research, and maintain an intelligence network in all parts of the world. Only countries with scientific resources can destroy the most powerful countries in the world."

### US Government Announces Major Overseas Defense Plan: The Area Ranges from Iceland to the Southwest Pacific, and the Proposal to Iceland, Although Rejected, Will Be Reconsidered

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Government authorities announced tonight that the United States' large-scale overseas defense plan is closely related to future international security measures. It was also learned that the United States began negotiations several months ago to obtain permanent military and aviation bases in Iceland. Although these negotiations have been temporarily suspended, they will resume after the Icelandic elections on June 30th. This matter is related to the overseas defense plan announced approximately today by the authorities. The authorities are unwilling to disclose the details of the development of this defense, only revealing the following points:

(1) The base area will extend from Iceland to Manus Island in Australian New Guinea in the Southwest Pacific.

(2) Other bases will be established on the islands of Japan, which are administered by the United States.

(3) The bases on the islands leased to the United States by the United Kingdom for a term of 99 years will be retained.

(4) The bases built within Latin America will be maintained separately by the countries of the Americas.

(5) The joint defense system and its joint defense staff established with Canada during the war will be maintained.

It is said that if Iceland joins the United Nations, the various facilities obtained by the United States there can be used by international organizations.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The US State Department issued an overseas defense plan and mentioned the proposal to Iceland in October last year to establish a base. Icelandic Prime Minister Thor Thors, who is engaged in political campaigns because of the upcoming election at the end of June, made a broadcast speech to the nation, declaring that the Icelandic government cannot grant the United States the right to establish an air base, which caused the US plan to suffer setbacks. It is heard that after the US government made the proposal last year, although it did not ask Iceland for a solution, it cannot be regarded as over. Thor Thors' frank statement this time did not change the US attitude, and it is expected that the matter will be reconsidered after the Icelandic election.

[US Information Service, Washington, 27th] The State Department issued a statement today, detailing the US proposal to Iceland regarding the joint use of Icelandic military equipment after the end of the war. The State Department stated that so far, the two sides have not held any negotiations.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The State Department issued a communiqué stating that US military personnel remaining in Iceland are being withdrawn.

### Secret of the "Flying Wing" Bomber Unveiled: Superfortress Pales in Comparison

[United Press, Los Angeles, 28th] The US Army officially unveiled the secret of the B-35 "Flying Wing" bomber today. The appearance of this aircraft makes the B-29 pale in comparison. Its range can exceed 10,000 miles, exceeding the world record of 8,198 miles set by the B-29 by about a quarter. The B-35 is designed and manufactured by Northrop Corporation. The shape of the aircraft is similar to the boomerang used by Australian Aborigines. The wings are slightly curved backwards. The crew, engine fuel, and weapons are all inside the wings. The total length of the two wings is 172 feet, and the center width is 37.5 feet. The normal load is 162,000 pounds.

### Channel Tunnel Project Still Plans to Strive for its Realization

[Reuters, London, 28th] The British Channel Tunnel Company will hold an annual meeting in June to discuss the construction of a railway and automobile tunnel under the English Channel. This plan was proposed during the Napoleonic era and again in 1924, but was rejected by the Imperial Defence Committee for military reasons. In 1929, Parliament established a special committee to study the plan. The cost of constructing a 36-mile-long tunnel was estimated at £30 million at the time, and the cost of vehicles and other equipment was £58 million. It was estimated that the journey from London to Paris would only take two hours and forty-five minutes. Although the committee considered the construction cost too high, it was economically beneficial to the United Kingdom. In 1930, the government issued a document on the matter, but ultimately rejected it. During World War II, it was once planned to start construction for defense reasons, but the government also expressed opposition at the time. Now that peace has been restored, there is even less hope of realization, but the people of the Channel Tunnel Company will continue to work hard to promote its realization.

### Britain Plans to Control the Newspaper Industry

Since the victory in Europe, the marriage rate in the United States has increased sharply compared to before. The number of marriages in January and February of this year increased by 67% compared to the same period last year.

### Britain Invites Indian Leaders to Participate in Round Table Conference: Conference Period is About Ten Days to Seek Solutions

[Reuters, New Delhi, 28th] The British Cabinet Delegation has been negotiating in India for a month with slow progress. Only yesterday, it invited representatives from the Congress Party and the Muslim League to convene a round table conference to resolve the different views of all parties regarding Indian independence. If all parties can accept participation in this conference, the conference period will last for a week or ten days to seek an agreement in order to facilitate the formation of a provisional people's government. The British Cabinet representatives previously held individual talks with Indian party leaders to listen to their opinions. Now they must be fully aware of everything, and in order to seek their cooperation, they initiated the convening of a round table conference.

### Moscow Museum Opens Special Room to Exhibit Gifts Received by Stalin

### US State Department to Propose: International Control of Atomic Energy: Reduce World Anxiety: Exclusively for Industrial Production Purposes

[Reuters, Manchester, 28th] British atomic expert Professor Braggart claimed that the US State Department will release a report on international control of atomic energy within days, suggesting that an International Atomic Energy Development Agency be formed by scientists, technicians, and engineers from various countries, and that the agency be responsible by the United Nations for most of the development of atomic energy. If the extraction of elements, the sale or transfer of atomic sources to public or private institutions for industrial production, and the supervision of the proper application of these raw materials are all presided over by the agency. The professor said that scientists invented this terrifying thing, and the world is panicked. Therefore, scientists should still find ways to reduce the world's anxiety in order to establish peace.

British Atomic Industry Under State Control

"Reuters, London, 28th] It was officially announced here yesterday that the British government will implement a bill next week stipulating that all industries in the UK that develop atomic energy will be placed under state control. The government is the general agency for controlling atomic energy and will establish research institutes in various places. In order to ensure that the achievements of atomic energy research can keep pace with other countries, a research institute has been established near Oxford.

Soviet Union Catching Up in Atomic Energy Research

[United Press, New York, 27th] The Soviet Academy of Sciences atomic energy plan book by Vavilov was recently released by the Soviet Embassy in the United States, focusing on the peaceful use of atomic energy. Although Van mentioned rocket artillery, he did not mention atomic warfare. Marshal Stalin ordered Soviet scientists to catch up quickly and exceed the scientific achievements of other countries in the near future. What Van said is a summary of how to implement this order. It is said that physics and chemistry occupy a particularly important position. Physicists cooperate with other experts to analyze all special phenomena in physics and try to release atomic nuclear energy, which has great hope for mankind. The future application of this energy will undoubtedly provide a new solution to problems such as power transportation. Van stressed that astronomers will have a position in atomic nuclear energy and its future development, which is not mentioned in the American plan. Astronomers can provide various ideas in terms of conducting work. The Soviet plan focuses on determining the actual decomposition substances obtained from the atomic nucleus, which refers to many chemical elements formed in the atomic furnace. At least 30 kinds are known in the American atomic work.

### Wonderful Solution to the Housing Shortage: Floating Homes: Converted from Landing Craft

If equipped with furniture, electric lights, electric heating, and other accessories, each one is worth about 2,400 yuan in total.

### Record of Imperial Hearing at the Indian Central Legislative Assembly

— Zhou Xiangke

I have been in India for several years, and I have always wanted to see India's legislative bodies, whether the Central Legislative Assembly or the provincial councils, because these are institutions of public opinion. However, I was preoccupied with school affairs and stuck in Calcutta. It wasn't until last winter that I was free from the duties of the Chinese School and traveled to the Ajanta Caves of India, dating back two thousand years. After passing through the two large native states of Poona and Gwalior and Agra, the former capital of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, I arrived in New Delhi, the Indian capital. There, I decided to visit the Indian Parliament. I visited my Indian friend, Professor N. G. Ranga. He was originally the leader of the Indian Labour Party and a member of the Central Legislative Assembly. He was honest and unassuming, short and stocky, and dedicated his life to fighting for the interests of farmers and workers. He is the author of "Indian Labour and Peasant Alliance and the Communist Party," which is admired by the world. I met him several times, and we both agreed that internationalism could only be discussed after national and ethnic freedom and independence. If a country itself is not independent and leans towards internationalism, it is tantamount to offering its own country to others with both hands.

To attend the Central Legislative Assembly, one must first have a member fill out a form to introduce and guarantee. Therefore, Professor Ranga specially filled out two application forms for me, giving me the opportunity to attend for two days. The application form must be submitted to the secretariat of the Central Legislative Assembly several days in advance, and then the secretariat will issue two admission tickets, which can be used for two days.

The Indian Central Legislative Assembly, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, is a magnificent building that soars into the clouds and is one of the three major British buildings in India. The perimeter of the building, about half a mile, is divided into two levels. The lower level has three large doors and six small doors, and the upper level has a corridor surrounded by circular stone pillars, each pillar being 27 feet high, with gaps between the pillars, making it extremely solemn and beautiful. The foundation of this Indian Parliament building was laid in 1921 and completed in 1927. On January 18, the opening ceremony was presided over by Lord Irwin. The construction took a full six years and cost a great deal of money. The dome in the middle of the building is 98 feet high, comparable to the 109-foot column of St. Paul's Cathedral in England.

Inside the Parliament Building, there are three main chambers. The first is the Central Legislative Assembly, or the Lower House; the second is the Council of States, or the Upper House; and the third is the Chamber of Princes. The Lower House can accommodate 400 people, the Upper House can accommodate 200 people, and the Chamber of Princes can only accommodate 120 people. Each chamber has its own small garden, pond, and party offices, such as the Indian National Congress office and the Muslim League office. These chambers, combined, are called the Parliament Building.

The Central Legislative Assembly meets every day from 11:00 AM to 1:30 PM, and then from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM or 6:00 PM. The assembly hall of the Central Legislative Assembly is semicircular. We, the audience, sit on the floor in front of the speaker, and the speaker's seat is in the center of the hall, with a long desk in front of him, where five or six staff members sit and work. This is the location of the parliament secretariat. Around 11:00 AM, the members arrive one after another. I saw that the members of the Indian National Congress wore white Gandhi caps on their heads and Indian clothes that reached the ground, rarely wearing Western suits. The members of the Muslim League also wore Muslim clothing. The seating arrangement has approximately ten rows and six columns, surrounding the speaker's seat in a semicircle. The four rows and six columns to the left of the speaker are the seats of the Indian National Congress, the two rows and six columns in the center are the seats of the Muslim League, and the four rows and six columns to the right of the speaker are the seats of the government and non-affiliated members. The leader of the Indian National Congress in the assembly is Sarat Chandra Bose, who once served as the chairman of the Bengal Provincial Committee of the Indian National Congress and is a famous lawyer. We know that the Bose who ran to Japan and established the Provisional Government of India in Singapore is his younger brother. The leader of the Muslim League in the assembly was supposed to be Jinnah, but unfortunately, at that time, Jinnah went to Calcutta to discuss the food problem with the Governor of Bengal, and I did not see his demeanor. Bose sits at the first table in the first row on the left side of the assembly hall. He is in his fifties, passionate, and speaks with humor. Anyone who sees him finds him adorable and not at all annoying. I met him three times, twice at his home and once in the assembly. He sincerely hopes for China's democracy and unity, just like Mr. Nehru's eager desire for China's unity.

The distribution of seats in the assembly, according to regulations, totals 145 seats, of which 104 seats are directly elected by the people, and 41 seats are appointed by the Governor-General of India. Of these 41 seats, 26 are senior government officials, including members of the Governor-General's Executive Council, and the remaining 15 are non-officials. In this session of the assembly, the Indian National Congress occupies 65 seats, the largest majority, while the Muslim League has only 24 seats. The speaker is elected by the members. The term of office for members is set at three years, but the Governor-General has the power to extend or shorten the term of office for members. Although there are some discords between the Congress Party and the Muslim League outside the assembly, they always stand on the side of the opposition and unite with the Indian National Congress in voting on bills in the assembly, taking unified action. From this, we can see that the ancient saying of "brothers quarreling within the walls, but united against external aggression" can be used everywhere.

When the assembly meets every day, the routine is oral inquiries, where the opposition party raises some questions, and then the members representing the government answer them one by one. In fact, these questions have been printed by the secretariat a few days in advance, and the government members are also prepared and have a clear understanding, so the questions and answers flow smoothly and endlessly. However, sometimes when the two sides get heated, the speaker often says "next question," and they immediately stop and do not argue anymore. I remember that on February 20th, before the oral inquiries, I heard news from England that the British Cabinet would send the Secretary of State for India, Lawrence, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander, and the President of the Board of Trade, Cripps, to India to resolve the Indian political problem. Then, Indian National Congress member Ayyangar spoke: "I am very happy to hear that the British Cabinet is sending members to India. I hope they will succeed in everything." He won applause from the entire venue. After the oral inquiries at each assembly meeting, there is a discussion. They argue fiercely over each bill. When the speaker puts the motion to a vote, if the opposition party members agree, they all say: "Aye (I)." This "Aye" means "I agree with this case (I agree With It)." The government party members say "No" in unison. Therefore, the opposition party members, that is, those who agree with this case, walk from the left side of the assembly hall to the room on the right side to sign, and the government party members all walk to the room on the left side to sign. Then, both sides return to their original seats, and the speaker counts the votes to determine the passage or rejection of this bill. If this case passes and the opposition party wins, the government party members will also respond with applause, without any unhappy expressions, demonstrating a democratic spirit.

After each bill is passed by the Central Legislative Assembly (or the Lower House), the Council of States (or the Upper House) has the right to review it again. The Upper House is composed of people with political experience and senior officials, with 60 members, of which 33 are elected and 27 are appointed by the Governor-General. Among these 27 people, officials cannot exceed 19, and the rest are non-officials. The chairman of the Upper House is appointed by the Governor-General, and the term of office for members is five years, but the Governor-General has the power to extend or shorten it. After all bills are passed by both the Upper and Lower Houses, the Governor-General can still return them for reconsideration or veto them. From this, we can see that the current legislative power in India is divided between the Governor-General and the Upper and Lower Houses. The Central Legislative Assembly is not a true legislative body, because the true legislative body is of course the British Parliament. However, the Central Legislative Assembly has the power to make laws for the Indian mainland. However, the British Parliament has the power to make various legal provisions for India, and the Central Legislative Assembly has no power to change or repeal them unless instructed or permitted by the British Parliament. Although India has not yet gained complete freedom and independence, the various measures of the legislative bodies are very democratic. (Sent from Calcutta on April 14)

### City Council Elections Held Enthusiastically and Tensely All Day Long, with National Flags Flying Everywhere as Morning Whistles Sounded, Disruptions Occurred in Several Places, Voting Suspended

[Report from this newspaper] Shanghai's first general election for city councilors (a total of 181 seats) unfolded yesterday amidst tension and disruptions, turning a historically significant democratic page!

At six o'clock in the morning, whistles sounded, and national flags flew throughout the city. Voters in each district began voting. By about nine o'clock, the election reached its peak. Mayor Qian also went to the Bund Park to vote as a voter in the first district at this time. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, also went to his district, Jing'an Temple, to vote early in the morning at eight o'clock. After voting, he went to the polling places of each district and vocational group in person to observe.

Tension and Disruptions Occurred. General elections were still new for Shanghai, so disputes inevitably occurred in several places. Among them, at the Taishan District’s Sino-French High School polling place in the fifth district, a dispute arose due to alleged vote-buying. In the Changning District of the fifth district, the election was suspended because of the disorder of voters, with more than 10,000 ballots lost. In the 13th district (Putuo District), voters crowded at Yufo Temple on Binlang Road, causing damage to the temple's doors and windows and causing a moment of tension, but the situation calmed down after mediation, and the election continued as usual. Vote-buying also occurred in the 19th district (Yulin District), causing a brawl and suspending the election. In the 26th district (Longhua District), a shooting incident occurred due to misunderstandings between the police and security forces. Later, according to opinions from all sides, voters bravely stood up to report bribery, vote-buying, and other irregularities, which eventually led to brawls and shootings. This was considered a good phenomenon during the election.

Vocational Group Re-election Completed. According to unofficial estimates, of the two million voters in the city, more than six-tenths actually participated in voting. Ballot boxes from various district polling places will be concentrated at district offices for counting at nine o'clock this morning, with city government officials supervising the counting. The list of elected councilors for each district should be announced within a few days.

Elections for the five vocational groups were also held yesterday at the venues designated by each group, separately and sequentially. Among them, the election for the Municipal Education Association group adopted a direct election method, while the other four groups, the Chamber of Commerce, Trade Union, Farmers' Association, and Free Professions, were re-elected by their primary election representatives to choose city councilors. The elections for each group went well, and the voting and counting procedures were completed as scheduled.

Investigating the Facts and Scheduling a Re-election. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of Civil Affairs, told reporters yesterday: "In terms of the election situation reported by each district, the general impression should be good. As for the districts where elections were suspended due to disputes, we are investigating the actual situation and will determine the date for a re-election after judgment." He also hoped that all parties would pay close attention to the provisions regarding invalid elections, invalid election, and litigation. According to Chapter 6 of the Municipal Council Election Regulations: "(1) If there is election fraud involving one-third or more of the names on the voter registration list, and the court renders a final judgment; or the election procedures violate the law and the court renders a final judgment, the election is invalid. (2) If the elected person dies or is unqualified, and the court renders a final judgment; or if the number of votes is false, and the court renders a final judgment, the elected is invalid. (3) In the event of an invalid election, a re-election shall be held within ten days after the court renders a judgment. (4) If it is confirmed that there is election fraud or the elected person is unqualified; or if the defeated candidate believes that he should have been elected, he may file a lawsuit, but it must be filed within seven days after the election results are announced. (5) Election lawsuits shall be judged before other types of lawsuits and shall be concluded in the first instance."

Tearing Up Ballots Arouses Public Outrage. The situations in various districts where disputes occurred are reported as follows: (1) In the Taishan District (Fifth District), the most crowded place was inside the Sino-French School on Xizang South Road. In the afternoon, voters lined up to the corner of Jinling Road. When reporters entered, they encountered a dispute. It turned out that the election supervisor, Mo Yousan, who kept accounts at a Jin Xian Restaurant, tore up six ballots, including two for Yang Fusheng, two for Wang Zhengting, and two for Zhou Lianze, arousing public outrage among the voters. He was immediately seized and handed over to the patrol officer on duty, who sent him to the police station for detention. However, he was bailed out by District Chief Zhu Wende. Soon after, Tong Ruihua, a clerk at the same place, was found to be withholding more than 20 ballots cast by voters for candidate Yang Fusheng and not putting them into the ballot box, also causing an uproar. Later, Mao Yingqin, the person in charge of the venue, returned part of the ballots to the original voters and handed over his reception ribbon and badge, along with nine other ballots, to patrol officer Yang Wentao for safekeeping, ordering him to testify for investigation. Also, at another polling place in the district, Lagenna Elementary School, someone was handing out ballots at the entrance, urging the crowd to vote for Lu Cha, arousing public outrage, but the distributor eventually fled into the crowd.

### Snippets from Polling Places

Yesterday, at 8:00 AM, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, went to the Gubat Apartment in his district, Jing'an, to vote. He happened to encounter a small dispute at the polling place. Director Wu personally mediated the dispute. A young man asked: "Who are you?" Director Wu smiled and said that he was someone who could resolve disputes.

After Director Wu cast his vote, a reporter asked him, "Who did you vote for?" He smiled again: "I'm afraid it's not convenient to say. But it's probably someone I know."

A 53-year-old Mrs. Cheng in Bund Park took a ballot but didn't know where to go. When asked who she voted for on the paper, she said: "I don't know. That gentleman wrote it for me."

The reporter first went to Bund Park in Huangpu District and praised the orderly atmosphere. But when they hurried to other places, the situation was very different and disappointing. It turned out it was because of the difference between the people and the place. Readers probably remember that the mayor voted in Bund Park.

The most important part of the "voting" work was providing transportation, using cars to transport voters to the polling places. Several blue trucks of the Chinese Relief and Rehabilitation Administration also came out in Nanshi with large flags.

It is said that the candidate who spent the most on entertaining guests was Mr. Yang. It is said that he hosted banquets at the Great China Hotel for 15 days, 15 tables each day, inviting all the residents of the district to participate at will, resulting in a bill of two million several hundred thousand yuan, with a total expenditure of over 40 million yuan.

A illiterate man took three ballots and wanted to hire someone to write for him. When asked who he wanted to vote for, he said very generously, "Whoever has the most, just choose them." A substitute voter said, "You vote for so-and-so!" He said, "Okay! Okay! Okay!"

Six or seven voters were whispering and discussing in front of the Sino-French High School in Taishan District. Some said: "He promised to give us money, but now he doesn't give it to us. We don't want to vote for him."

Cinderella Ballroom is one of the polling places in Xincheng District. The entrance was filled with small tables, especially for voters to sign in. The place was relatively spacious, and although there were many people, the order was still good. The first name on the list of candidates was Mr. Chen Taoyi. An old gentleman wrote Mr. Chen's name neatly on the ballot and put it into the ballot box. When the reporter told him that Mr. Taoyi had passed away, he couldn't help but feel lost.

Most of the voters were extremely impatient, breaking many doors and windows, especially in Putuo District. Tian'an Church in Laozha District only opened one door in the morning. The place was small and crowded, and as a result, the gate was simply closed. Unexpectedly, Shanghai's first ever election was held with the door closed! It was only opened once after a batch of voters finished voting, and the voters who returned were full of complaints.

A rickshaw puller from Sichuan, Hu Ningsheng (resident of No. 98 Wangjia Ancestral Hall, 28 years old), hid 300 ballots to run errands for the person who entrusted him. As a result, they didn't get to the ballot box but walked into the police station.

The election of the City Chamber of Commerce began at about 9:00 AM. A total of 268 delegates attended. The polling place was filled with a long table covered with white cloth. The voters sat face to face, quietly, with a cup of tea and a pencil, looking like they were holding a forum. Famous figures from the industrial and commercial sectors had all attended. Each time the results of the vote were announced, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, raised his voice and announced them publicly.

Du Yuesheng, despite his long illness, also attended in person yesterday, sitting in a reclining chair in the back of the stage, chatting enthusiastically with Director Wu and Xu Jilong. After the second vote was announced, Wang Xiaolai loudly announced that Mr. Du Yuesheng had been elected with 187 votes, Du immediately bowed and nodded frequently to the delegates on stage to express his gratitude.

The election of the Education Association group was held in the gymnasium of Gezhi Middle School. It is said that there were more than 4,000 members in total. Entering the polling place, it was seen that female teachers accounted for the vast majority. Chen Su, a specialist from the Social Affairs Bureau, sat there very seriously, surrounded by desks. Each voter had to pass through 25 desks from entering the door through checking credentials, issuing tickets, writing tickets, and voting.

Participants in the Free Professions group election included journalists, lawyers, accountants, doctors, etc., so the progress of various election methods was discussed in great detail, and the most opinions were expressed. As a result, everything was decided by the public. The ranking of the eleven candidate councilors was also decided by drawing lots. Twenty or so delegates gathered in a small room on the third floor of the Central Daily News on Yuanmingyuan Road, and the voting process appeared enthusiastic and tense.

The Trade Union election venue was borrowed from the Ningbo Association Hall. More than 300 people attended. One or two of the elected councilors happily ran to the microphone on the stage and broadcasted words of thanks to the whole audience.

Zhang Xiaosong, Director of Civil Affairs, arrived at the Civil Affairs Office at 5:30 AM to sit and oversee the situation. He said: "I didn't have time to eat breakfast, so I bought two sets of scallion pancakes and fried dough sticks to fill my stomach temporarily." Around 9:00 AM, phone calls from various districts came one after another, and he had a hard time keeping up. He spent 400 yuan for a set meal for lunch. The situation calmed down in the afternoon. He said: "There are no wars on any front."

Yesterday, the voting situation at Zhenhua Elementary School in the fifth district was very enthusiastic. Thanks to the efforts of Zhu Jiasheng, Director of the Election Affairs in the area, and Wu Guanghan and Huang Guangyi, representatives of the district, the order was good.

### Gunfire Suddenly Erupts in the Hongqiao District; Commissioner and Chief Beaten Severely

At the Hongqiao District election venue, located at Hongxi Elementary School, the candidates, according to reports, included Chen Xuewen, Ding Shanming, Shen Yide, and others. Yesterday, Zhou Zuwang, the director of the Pingmin Xiyi Institute (People's Vocational Training Institute), led 846 commoners to the venue, requesting 800 ballots. They ultimately obtained 700. When entering the venue, they were accompanied by six police officers from the Security Police Squad and staff from the institute. At that time, a local resident named Yao Guoxiong, dressed in Western attire and carrying a firearm, was noticed by personnel from the district office, who advised him to relinquish his weapon. This was discovered by a police officer from the Security Squad, who took both the man and the gun to a nearby police station. He was later released on bail. Guoxiong, feeling he had lost face, fired seven or eight shots, fortunately without injuring anyone. When Commissioner Yan of the Social Affairs Bureau and the institute director went out to investigate, unexpectedly, some villagers blamed Yan and Zhou, surrounded them, beat them severely, and threw them into the river, causing serious injuries. They were later sent to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, He, the head of the Longhua Branch Bureau, personally led his subordinates late at night to investigate the details and report them to the General Bureau for review and action.

### Auspicious Day, Happy Union: A Grand Celebration of Our Newspaper's General Manager Chen's Wedding

On a pleasant afternoon, Xing Hua Lou restaurant on Fuzhou Road presented a lively and harmonious scene. Qian Da-jun, Yu Hong-jun, Minister, and many other important figures appeared successively among the crowd.

Guests arrived one after another, signed their names under the guidance of five staff members, and were then led to the hall by ushers. The hall was decorated brilliantly and captivatingly.

Around 3:00 PM, the hall was already packed, with latecomers finding it nearly impossible to squeeze in. At this moment, someone suddenly spoke through the loudspeaker, asking the guests to make way. Then, Qian, the Mayor and the marriage officiant, Pan Gongzhan, the introducer, and Shi Geng, looking radiant, quickly entered the venue.

After the marriage officiant and others took their places, amidst the applause of the crowd, our groom, Chen Xunyu, dressed in formal attire, walked at a measured pace through the crowd of elegantly dressed guests, offering nods of gratitude to the attendees with a knowing smile.

Following the groom, of course, came the bridesmaids and the bride. At this moment, the hall quieted down from the excitement, and every guest seemed to crane their necks.

To the beautiful strains of the wedding march, the bride finally made her way to the platform. At this time, the guests turned their heads from left to right, with thousands of eyes fixed on the bride.

Mayor Qian, the marriage officiant, began to speak, addressing the groom as "Brother Xunyu," and congratulating the bride and groom on their everlasting love and lifelong happiness.

The introducer, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, delivered a speech in a humorous tone, saying, "I am a ready-made introducer, because I did not know about Brother Xunyu's marriage beforehand. It was only after I returned to Chongqing that I learned he was engaged in Shanghai." Minister Yu Hongjun addressed the gathering, expressing his admiration for the groom's "character as a person" and explaining that he had come specifically from Nanjing to attend the wedding.

Cheng Zhonghang, the Jiangsu Provincial Inspector, announced the love story of the bride and groom, and congratulated the newlyweds with "glory and victory," explaining: "Mr. Chen's ability to obtain such a virtuous wife is a victory, and for the bride to be matched with such a successful figure can be said to be glorious."

Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, congratulated the newlyweds with the three words "Truth, Beauty, Goodness," saying, "Truth is sincere love, beauty is a happy marriage, and goodness is a perfect union."

Yesterday, in the hall, every guest enjoyed a precious gift: "Chen Wangfu's Happy Event" cigarettes specially made by the Fuhua Tobacco Company. The fragrant smoke added infinite interest to the guests.

Although there were many guests, the order was excellent, which was undoubtedly due to the chief steward, Director Sun Jialiang of the branch bureau. He personally directed, running around busily, his hard work was commendable.

Guest List: The guests included: Qian Dajun, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Shaozhu, Chen Xing, Ye Suzhong, Qian Yongming, Du Yuesheng, Dong Xian Guang, Hu Jianzhong, Wu Rencang, Wu Jingxiong, Li Zhongxiang, Fan Zhengbo, Zhu Zongliang, Zuo Shunsheng, Sheng Zhenwei, Liu Hongsheng, Liu Gongyun, Wu Qiding, Yu Songjun, Zhao Zukang, Chen Shiquan, Chen Baohua, Chen Bozhuang, Xu Xueyu, Luo Yunyan, Xie Chengyu, Liu Baimin, Wei Jingmeng, Wang Xinheng, Sun Qinchi, Ke Xin, Zhu Xubai, Xu Jiqing, Xi Yushu, Li Shuming, Zhang Shizhao, Qin Runqing, Jin Runxiang, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinrong, Xu Shihao, Tao Baichuan, Wang Yansong, Wang Zhixin, Yu Zuoting, Xu Yongzuo, Shen Tianxin, Li Zufan, Shi Shouchang, Zhou Peizhen, Tang Boqi, Song Xunlun, Zhang Yishu, Du Weifan, Guo Lanxin, Wu Yaqin, Ren Jinpin, and more than a thousand people including fellow businessmen Feng Youzhen and Li Zikuan. (Qi Lin)

Scattered Ballots, Election Halted (29th District (Changning District)): Due to chaos at the polling stations and scattered ballots, the election process was completely halted within three hours of its start. Changning District had three polling stations: the first at Fudan Middle School on Haig Road, the second at the Central Research Institute at the end of Yuyuan Road, and the third at St. John's University. At around 9:00 AM, as voters continued to arrive at the polling station, the candidate Gu Zhu-hong had people commission numerous large trucks loaded with voters to the polling station and many people held white flags, campaigning inside and outside the venue, the order suddenly became chaotic. The air inside the venue was tense, and over ten thousand blank ballots were suddenly scattered all over the ground. Moreover, some people in the venue brought pre-filled ballots to the polling stations at Fudan Middle School and the Central Research Institute. One youth held more than ten ballots. His classmates, feeling indignant, started a conflict, which ultimately led to violence. Therefore, the elections at these three famous schools were announced to be suspended at 10:30 AM. Gu Zhuqi, the central figure in this disturbance, is from northern Jiangsu, and the voters he brought were mostly his fellow villagers.

Guarding the Ballot Boxes, A Vicious Brawl (3rd) The 19th District (Yulin District) had a total of twenty-four candidates, with four official seats for senators. The district had four polling stations. Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, over a hundred people, holding small flags with the name of candidate Yang Zhiqian written on them, entered the venue. They stationed themselves at each of the four ballot boxes with 20 people to each box, snatched the stamps from the staff at the venue, and stamped ballots arbitrarily, distributing them to voters in large quantities. The ballots flew in the air like leaflets, causing a dispute. Meng Zicai, the chief of the district office, and Fang Daqu, the section chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau, came out to mediate, but were beaten and injured. The troublemakers also smashed tables and chairs, throwing the order into chaos. When Xiang Changquan, the deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, heard the news, he immediately arrived and was extremely indignant. He immediately ordered the election to be stopped and rescheduled. Shortly after, the Yulin Road Police Station was informed and dispatched police to suppress the situation, taking eight leaders of the incident, as well as the injured Meng Zicai, Fang Daqu, and five assistants from the district office, to the station.

### Zhao Qunhao of Our Newspaper Elected in the Professional Groups Election

In various professional groups, it is almost a sure thing. Unexpectedly, in the election venue of free professional groups, I heard that a "dark horse" came out.

Among the voters of free professional groups, there are lawyers and accountants with the most thorough thinking, and there are "predictions" for this election of municipal senators, very many and most of them very effective. Especially the scientifically minded doctors, and also a few journalists with rich social experience. With such a high level of knowledge, of course, they may not be subject to any restrictions or influences.

The candidate whose photos were published the most, and the candidate whose campaign speeches were the most moving - were also the representatives of free professional groups.

However, because the people who voted are all of a considerable level, during the election, they will only rely on their own rational judgment.

We are very happy that in the election of journalists, Mr. Zhao Junhao, the deputy editor-in-chief of our newspaper, was finally elected in an extremely difficult environment.

This is definitely not a "dark horse"! Close-up of Zhao Junhao

### Food Minister Xu Kan Discusses Current Food Policy Measures: Decisive Quantity Control, Price Opening, and Expanding Grain Sources

Food Minister Xu Kan, who recently arrived in Shanghai, is, according to President Song's instructions, planning various measures for the city's food policy and instructing the Shanghai Special Commissioner's Office to handle it properly. Recently, with U.S. President Representative Hoover about to visit China for inspection, he is busy organizing various materials, and his official duties are becoming increasingly complicated. Yesterday, the reporter visited the Food Administration Special Commissioner's Office to inquire about important measures related to the current food policy. Mr. Xu took time out of his busy schedule to briefly inform us about the food policy measures as follows:

The General Situation of Food at Present: Mr. Xu said: In this war, the production of agricultural countries around the world has shrunk, and famine is inevitable. Now that the tangible enemies of the world have been defeated, the intangible enemies of famine and disease are on the rise, and we must rely on the joint efforts of the allied countries to overcome the difficulties. As for overcoming famine, there are only two ways: international mutual assistance and self-reliance. The former, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has made its best efforts. China, having suffered agricultural damage in the long war of resistance, and the vastness of the disaster-stricken areas last year, should of course receive more food supplies. Last year, the UN agreed to provide us with 90,000 tons of rice. From January to March this year, it agreed to provide another 47,200 tons of rice. Recently, it was decided to allocate 115,000 tons of rice from April to June, but this number is still considered insufficient given China's population area and wartime disaster situation, and the Executive Yuan is continuing to request increased allocation.

Extremely Welcoming to Mr. Hoover: Recently, U.S. President Representative Hoover will be visiting China to inspect the famine situation, and we express our warmest welcome and expectations. At present, a small number of people in friendly countries still lack knowledge of the food shortage in our country. Mr. Hoover's trip will certainly obtain some practical information for reference. I believe that after he returns to his country, he will be able to appeal on our behalf in many ways to obtain more relief food. As for self-reliance, the Ministry of Food has been working towards this goal over the years. The current facilities are to strengthen storage and transportation to adjust surpluses and deficits on the one hand; and to call for frugality and reduce waste on the other hand. Recently, a large batch of grain stored in Sichuan Province is about to be transported down, and the surplus grain collected and stored in Jiangxi and Fujian over the years is also being rushed to aid Hunan, Guangdong, and other provinces. In general, the Ministry of Food is always paying attention to adjusting the food supply in various parts of the country, and has not been slack. If this year's harvest is bountiful and the UN food can be transported in large quantities, there is really no need to worry about the future of domestic food supply.

Unblocking Sources and Suppressing Grain Prices: As for grain prices, Mr. Xu said: The Ministry has its own methods for stabilizing grain prices in various parts of the country. After the victory of the War of Resistance, grain prices in the rear provinces were very stable. In the recovered provinces, due to population migration and transportation difficulties, there were inevitably some fluctuations. The only countermeasure of the Ministry is to control prices with quantity, open up grain sources, and gradually stabilize them. Taking Shanghai as an example, most of the grain merchants before the war have changed or stopped their business. After the recovery, the organization and operating power of grain merchants were greatly weakened, and they unanimously requested government loans to help them. After several considerations, it was decided to loan. A loan review panel for grain merchants was organized, with representatives from the Ministry's Special Commissioner's Office, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Council, the Shanghai Municipal Bean and Rice Industry Association, and the Bank of China, jointly reviewing. All merchants applying for loans must go through the prescribed procedures, and the procedures are very strict. This method is actually to enrich the source of grain in Shanghai and adjust people's food. However, at the beginning of the implementation, there may inevitably be loopholes, which should be prevented at any time and gradually improved to achieve perfection. In the first half of this month, the grain price in Shanghai was still stable, and the source of food was also more prosperous. In recent days, there has been a fluctuation again. Although this is related to the source and the price in the producing area, there are still elements of speculation and profiteering, the public security authorities and relevant agencies are closely watching, and will take effective measures to stabilize the people's lives. The Ministry is also working hard to clear the source of grain and strictly prohibit speculation.

The Situation of Military Grain Preparation in the Country: Finally, the reporter asked about the situation of military grain preparation in the country. Mr. Xu said: Improved methods have been set for the preparation of military grain in various provinces, and the provinces are now actively handling them in accordance with the regulations. However, in some places, due to security, transportation, and disasters, transportation is very difficult. The Ministry and the logistics department are now working hard to overcome these problems, so that there will be no shortage before the autumn harvest.

### Man and Woman Share a Room, Murder Attempt Follows: The Woman's Neck is Strangled, Barely Breathing

(Reported by this newspaper) At the Railway Hotel in Gaoshou Lane 245, Jier Road, at about 2:00 PM on the 25th, a male and female traveler came to rent a room. The waiter led them to room T2, and the male, Shen Jun (35 years old, from Nanxun), and the female, Chen Aidi (23 years old, from Suzhou), filled out the registration book. They stayed in the room that night. The next morning, they got up at dawn and went to the North Station to buy military tickets, but failed. They then returned to the hotel. Chen Aidi lay down on the bed and fell asleep. After half an hour, the waiter suddenly heard a cry for help from the room. He managed to open the door and saw the male traveler, Shen Jun, looking flustered, rushing out. Upon entering the room, he saw that the female guest's neck was tightly bound with a trouser belt, and she was barely breathing. The hotel urgently reported to the North Station Police Bureau and sent the woman to the hospital. Her life is in danger. The motive for the attempted murder may be a love dispute. The police station in charge is investigating.

### Yu Hongjun Returns to Nanjing

Since flying to Shanghai from Nanjing on the afternoon of the 24th, Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun has taken significant measures regarding the city's finances and economy. In addition to inspecting various agencies under the Ministry of Finance, he has also been planning to restore the business of various exchanges, and has repeatedly met with Director Jin Li Jiyuan and the representatives who came to Shanghai to receive them. The group stayed at the East Asia Hotel yesterday.

This year, the 45th Global General Conference will be held in Washington, D.C. on June 6. The total number of representatives from various countries attending the conference is around 10,000. The Chinese representatives from the China General Association selected to attend this time include Xu Yusun, the vice-chairman of the General Association, Li Chengzhang, the accountant of the General Association, and Li Daming, the president of the Guangxi District Association. Except for Xu, who will depart later due to personal reasons, the other two departed on the afternoon of the 28th aboard the Joseph Lykes for the U.S.

### The Misfortune of Street Vendors: Thirty-Six Glass Cases of Goods Confiscated, Many Were Not Smuggled U.S. Military Supplies

(Reported by this newspaper) At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, U.S. military police in six or seven jeeps arrived near the Dasing Company on Liuhe Road and confiscated all the goods in the glass cases of thirty-six street vendors. The street vendor Xie Zhaode, in an attempt to grab back his items, was injured in the foot by a jeep. However, most of the confiscated goods were not smuggled U.S. military supplies, such as eyeglasses from Maochang Company, Marius cigarettes on which taxes had been paid, and striped silk fabrics bought from Baodaxiang and other stores. The loss per vendor was approximately between 200,000 to 1 million yuan. The vendors went to the MP headquarters in the Huidifeng Building and other places to inquire, and heard that the U.S. military had agreed to return some of the non-illegal goods to the police station for redistribution to the vendors next Tuesday.

It has been learned that the committee's investigation team will commence a comprehensive investigation today to provide a reference for the reports of various property owners and the applications of agencies.

### Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng of the Central Reception Committee Flies to Shanghai; Graying Hair, Vigorous Spirit; Extremely Excited to Revisit Old Haunts

Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, arrived in Nanjing from Chongqing a few days ago to preside over the relocation of the Central Party Headquarters. Yesterday, he flew to Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation plane, arriving at Longhua Airport at 4:00 PM. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Sun Qinchi, representing Mayor Qian, Director Chen Shiquan, as well as Shi Shouchang, Dong Dayou, Huang Jianfen, and over twenty others.

Mr. Wu was wearing a gray woolen hat, a navy blue suit, and a black woolen coat. His hair had grayed, and his face was also clearer than before, but his spirit was still extremely vigorous. After getting off the plane and exchanging greetings with the welcomers, he went to the customs official residence on Yuyuan Road to rest. Mayor Qian and Minister Yu successively visited and had a long conversation. (Note: Both Mr. Wu and Mr. Yu were former mayors of this city. It is indeed a happy occasion that they met with the current mayor after the victory and reminisced about the past.) Mr. Wu then met with the heads of various agencies in Shanghai under the Central Party Headquarters and inquired about various matters. A reporter from the Central News Agency then visited and inquired about the progress of the Central Party Headquarters' relocation to Nanjing and the date of the National Assembly's postponement. Mr. Wu replied, "Most of the personnel of the Central Party Headquarters have already arrived in Nanjing to work. A small number of staff members are waiting due to the shallow waters of the Yangtze River and obstructed shipping. Once the Yangtze River water level rises, they will take a boat directly to Nanjing. As for

The Date of the National Assembly: If the domestic political situation can be resolved according to the path already achieved by the Political Consultative Conference, and the Communist Party has no new demands to raise, then the National Assembly can be held very soon." Mr. Wu then smiled and told the reporter, "The war of resistance has aged people in eight years, but the spirit has not declined. I am extremely excited to be revisiting old haunts today in Shanghai. It is especially a coincidence that Shanghai citizens are enthusiastically holding senatorial elections. It is a pity that I could not arrive yesterday, but I will never give up this right to vote that I should enjoy," and so on.

### U.S. Sailor Murder Case Indicted: First Case Handled by Our Court Involving a Crime Committed by an American after the Sino-American Agreement was Signed

(Reported by this newspaper) The case of U.S. merchant seaman Weber, who injured U.S. Navy sailor Scripps to death near Broadway and Yongding Road at 11:00 PM on the 8th of this month, has been transferred by the U.S. Consulate General to the Shanghai District Court for investigation according to law. Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang appointed Prosecutor Cao Hong to be responsible for this matter. The court has opened three sessions to investigate, and also brought the defendant to the scene of the incident for an on-site inspection, and took photos. In addition, they went to the U.S. Naval Hospital ship to check the autopsy report and summon witnesses for questioning. The defendant Weber confessed to the facts of the crime without denying it. Therefore, after the investigation was completed, he was prosecuted according to law. Since the occurrence of this case, the Sino-American authorities have attached great importance to it, because this is the first case handled by the Shanghai District Court involving a crime committed by an American after the signing of the Sino-American Agreement on January 11, 1943.

### The "Three Old Men" in the Loyal Character Prison

Speaking of the "Three Old Men," everyone in Shanghai knows them. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, they were involved in nearly every event: openings, weddings, and epitaph writings.

With the arrival of victory, the Military Intelligence Bureau's Shanghai office, admiring their fame, "invited them for a short stay." For several months, they "rested behind closed doors," which actually saved them a lot of trouble from external invitations. On the morning of April 3rd, the Three Old Men were taken in ten jeeps to the Loyal Character Prison in Tilanqiao. The court's decision to house the "Three Old Men" in the Loyal Character Prison, with Liang Hongzhi and others as neighbors, was quite ingenious. Some people once called the Three Old Men the Three Stars of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity. Now that the Three Stars have graced the prison with their presence, is this a blessing or a misfortune for the prison?

In prison, Lin Kanghou still wore a neat Western suit, while Mr. Wen and Mr. Yuan removed their long robes and wore short jackets. The "Old Men" each had witty remarks: Wen Lantao said, "If there is heaven, there must be me," hoping for a quick trial and sentencing. Lin Kanghou said, "Others did underground work in Shanghai, I did aboveground work." Yuan Ludeng said, "What Mr. Lin said is exactly what I wanted to say."

Originally, eight out of ten cases of Chinese traitors are said to be related to underground work and meritorious service to the country. As for what the "Three Old Men" said, the details will be revealed during the trial.

Currently, Yuan Ludeng among the "Three Old Men" was the first to be investigated and the first to be publicly prosecuted. The High Court's public trial is imminent. In Shanghai, many people who have long admired the names of the "Old Men" want to see their faces and hear their "patriotic theories." When the time comes, there will surely be a grand spectacle near Tilanqiao. (Mu Ren)

### Lin Kanghou Still in Western Suit, Wen and Yuan Remove Long Robes and Wear Short Jackets

Negotiations in the financial community have been largely decided. It is learned that Minister Yu is scheduled to fly back to Beijing today (29th) to preside over the return of the Ministry of Finance to the capital.

### Overseas Chinese Representatives to the National Assembly Huang Boyao and Others Arrive in Shanghai

Huang Boyao and Chen Botong (USA), Huang Juewei (Canada), Li Jieping (Peru), Zhang Peizi (Cuba), Zheng Huaqiu (Panama), Chen Xinlong (Mexico), and Sun Haichou (Chile), eight overseas Chinese representatives to the National Assembly from North and South America, departed from Shenyang on the large ship "General" on the 12th of this month and arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday. The Shanghai National Assembly Representative Reception Office, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, and the Municipal Government all sent representatives to welcome them at the pier. Chen Qingyun of the Central Overseas Department also specially sent the personnel office of the department.

### The Everlasting Summer Capital with Rich Southern Flavors: A Tour of the Taipei Museum Botanical Garden

— Special Correspondent Mu Yun from Taiwan, Air Mail Report of the 20th from This Newspaper

Taipei is a bright, cultural, and political city, as well as a city of everlasting summer with red flowers, green leaves, and rich southern flavors. More than two hundred years ago, it was just a place for Fujianese people to build ships and engage in械斗, clan fights. After the Japanese management, it has transformed from a vast wilderness into a purely modern city, with a population of 200,000 and 4,426 acres of land. In this new city, we can smell the blood and sweat of the imperialists, and we can also see the hoof marks of the Taiwanese people being oppressed.

We cannot deny the Japanese's hard work, but at the same time, we must be vigilant about how confident we are in controlling and maintaining this existing vitality.

A Museum Tour

In front of the former Governor-General's Office, in the coconut groves of Taipei Park, stands a Western-style building with a dome, which is the museum. The summer atmosphere of the park is unique, with a humid and warm current that makes people forget that Shanghai is still in the cold. The museum was built by the "voluntary contributions" of six million people in the province. It was originally to commemorate Governor-General Kodama and Chief Secretary Gotō, but now Kodama is nowhere to be found, and Gotō has become a prisoner awaiting trial.

A Thoroughbred, Barely Better Than Remains

In the courtyard of the museum, two primitive locomotives are displayed: No. 9, which was first used in Japan (Meiji 5th year) between Yokohama and Shinbashi; and No. 1 "Tengyun," which Qing Dynasty Taiwan Governor Liu Mingchuan bought from Germany for use in Taiwan. To the left of the museum is a leather carriage with only the shell remaining, lying horizontally in the desolate grass of the setting sun, as if it was once the vehicle of Prince Kan'in Kotohito and Princess Chieko. There was also a once-famous, tall horse, now only a skeleton, sinking into the mud in the wind and rain. People no longer remember it when they pass by, and it, like the fate of the Japanese Empire, has declined.

Entrance Ticket NT$0.50

With another NT$0.50 entrance ticket, we entered the building. The female staff members who originally provided guidance and explanations to Japanese visitors are now squatting on the side because they cannot speak the national language. Following the documents of the Japanese surrender, there is the Nanyang Hall, displaying the daily necessities and models of the indigenous people of Nanyang. Then there are the documents of the Gaoshan tribe and the Qing Dynasty, as well as the Japanese rule of Taiwan. What impressed us most was the proclamation of Liu Yongfu, the Imperial Commissioner in charge of Taiwan's defense, and the announcement of the Changhua County Magistrate on February 28th of the 24th year of Guangxu: "A reward of six thousand taels of silver for sinking a large Japanese ship, and a reward of two hundred taels of silver for taking the head of a Japanese general." There is also a red cypress tree from Xin Gaoshan, which germinated in 1026 AD during the fourth year of Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song dynasty, which has a deep historical significance. The Japanese displayed China's national treasures, which was insulting, but they still preserved them and returned them to us. This is exactly the history of Taiwan in the past sixty years. But when we saw the couplet written by Liu Mingchuan, "The holy age is now full of rain and dew, and the virtuous are born here with glory," encouraging Jiasheng to go abroad as an envoy, and then look at the reality of our arrival in Taiwan, we couldn't help but feel terrified!

A Tropical Garden

The most vivid expression of the subtropical scenery is the tropical garden - the botanical garden. The garden is located in the southwest of the city, and buses can take you directly there. From a distance, you can see the towering coconut groves, which, under the reflection of the blue sky, make people fall in love with the southern country of the island.

The Scenery of the Coconut Grove is Delightful

The garden is full of coconut groves mixed with tropical trees of different families. You will definitely prefer the magnificent figure of the Alexander coconut, set off by the tall and slender scarlet clothes of the Taiwanese girls, which complement each other. Under the tall figure, there are scattered rows of small Bonin Island screwpines that look like needles. There are also Australian paperbarks, shady nine-joint trees, mountain palms that bloom with yellow melon-like flowers, old, disheveled pineapples (jackfruit), and rickety banyan trees... [and] the lovely acacia trees...

Listening to the Pine Breeze and the Banana Rain

I love to listen to the pine breeze, but I love to listen to the night rain on the banana leaves even more. There are many banana trees here, although it is not as warm as Tainan, and the climate limits their opportunity to mature early. Perhaps you love to fish. By the shady pond, even young children are quietly holding fishing rods. The shadow of war is like the sunlight passing through the garden, difficult to trace. No, what can be traced is only the bridge leading to the Jian Gong Shrine, the lotus leaves on the water, and the broken steel bones and cement floating horizontally. Only a tilted bronze horse is still struggling with its last courage, standing in the wilderness. The "Institute of Forestry" has changed its name to "Forestry Experimental Station," and the afforestation plan with sixty-two high mountains over 16,000 meters and an area of 36,000 square kilometers is conceived here. This is the nursery of the forest and the nanny of the natural trees.

Emerald Green Talking Parrot

To the northeast of Taipei City, another ten minutes away, you can reach the zoo in Zhongshan Park, which is also a tropical garden. Like the botanical garden, it quietly squats by the Keelung River. A turquoise-green talking parrot with a red beak chirps and greets visitors at the entrance with a wry smile. The small Western-style houses are tightly closed with iron fences and scattered in irregular rows. People can recall that there were tropical animals not long ago, but now most of them are empty. There are only a few apes and monkeys, coveting the bananas and tangerines in the hands of the visitors, two egrets, peacocks with long tails, and white chickens. The only lion left has lost its original ferocity, and the majestic elephant sucking on the iron fence has also been deprived of sufficient nutrition due to high prices, and is as thin as a camel without a bell. You will feel a strong sense of desolation here: sparse people, dilapidated garden scenery, and empty cages of the small animals that have disappeared! And when I discovered the sheep from the northern country lying in the ashes next to the kitchen, bleeding and struggling with a dying life, it increased our hatred for those who could not properly take over! Negligence, perfunctoriness, and irresponsibility have caused the poor animals who have lost their freedom to suffer the same disaster as "fish in the pond."

Hoover on His Way to China, Assisting Truman in Relieving World Food Shortage

### Truman's Close Aides: Six Advisors in the White House

— Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department from The New York Times

President Truman's loyalty to his friends is well-known in Washington, and it has caused a complex reaction: some praise it as a virtue, while others say it is a weakness - a weakness that may become a political fatal wound for Mr. Truman and the Democratic Party by 1948. Nevertheless, President Truman has a group of close advisors around him in the White House, and their only common point seems to be the bond of friendship, which, if not uniting them with each other, at least unites them in their unwavering loyalty to their leader, and at the same time unites him personally with their group. This group provides advice to the President, guides his actions, and influences his thinking.

Their talents vary. They came here one after another and have been subjected to public criticism that is only slightly less harsh than that received by some of the "Young Turks" of Roosevelt's staff. Mr. Truman, true to his reputation, holds on tightly to this group of advisors and cannot bear to give them up.

Perhaps people will wonder why a President, in addition to his formal cabinet, needs to establish another more intimate and confidential "Vice Cabinet" to facilitate things? There are three reasons for answering this question: First, no President chooses his own cabinet. Filling the ten important positions in the cabinet requires considering many factors - policies, geography, obedience, and even proper status - which cannot be determined by personal preferences. Second, most presidents feel lonely and isolated after taking office. They need friendly and congenial companions to accompany them. Third, the President is busy with countless affairs and constantly encounters special problems that require special handling.

No one in Truman's inner circle appears as an old politician, like Baruch in President Roosevelt's staff. Nor is there a particularly close confidant, like Roosevelt's confidants Hopkins and Howe.

"White House Advisor" is a very precise name. Its definition varies depending on the interpretation of each individual. The six advisors described in this article are, in the author's opinion, the most outstanding members of the group. As for who among the six is dominant, it is difficult to say.

If this article had been written a month ago, the name of Judge Samuel I. Rosenman would definitely have been included in the list of Mr. Truman's advisors, but the name of Hannegan might have been deleted. If this article had been written a month later, then the names of Chester Bowles, Paul Porter, Wilson Wyatt, and Clark Clifford would have to be added. They are all new staff members.

In addition, there are many other close associates of President Truman whom the author has not included in this article because they stand on the periphery of the White House, rather than at its core. They are experts, not general policy designers.

Mathematical Genius, Hardworking and Keen

Vinson

Secretary of the Treasury Fred M. Vinson, a man in his fifties with thick hair and a heavy build, trained in Southern Democratic politics for nearly forty years, occupies a superior position among President Truman's close advisors. However, when mentioning his political background, we should not overlook that he is the most capable tax and financial expert in the United States. He served in the House of Representatives for fourteen years, and finally served as Chairman of the Taxation Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee.

President Truman strives to make use of Vinson's calm judgment, but his greatest strength lies in taxation and financial matters. It was Vinson who persuaded the public and Congress to accept the Bretton Woods financial agreement. He is now launching the same campaign to prepare for the debate on loans to Britain.

To succeed in this difficult and specialized work, one must have a mathematical genius and a hardworking spirit. These two virtues, this upright and amiable "Judge," have long been known to the world. In addition, he brings to President Truman a sensitive political understanding, a broad and friendly relationship in the White House, sound common sense, and warm personal friendships. The room he has opened in the Wardman Park Hotel is a favorite social gathering place for President Truman, where he often spends an evening playing cards with friends.

Bearing Heavy Responsibilities, Reserved and Solemn

Snyder

John W. Snyder, as reserved and solemn as a church deacon, sits in a simple office in the White House, leisurely managing the nation's economic affairs. The Director of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, a position he holds, is one of the most demanding positions in the government. It is no exaggeration to say that he is President Truman's "right hand" in every economic matter, from civil to military. Recently, he has been criticized for being too rigid and ordinary in his duties, unable to keep up with the changing and rapid dynamics. His impression on most people is that of a figure in the noisy Washington atmosphere.

Truman's relationship with Byrnes would be counterproductive, because until the last minute, Truman's name as a vice-presidential candidate replaced Byrnes' name. The two men had always respected each other since serving together in the Senate. Byrnes's entry into Truman's cabinet was not because he had profound knowledge of diplomacy or international issues, but because of his quick mind and skillful handling of affairs.

Byrnes stepped down from his comfortable position on the Supreme Court in October 1942 to take over the civilian part of the National Resources Planning Board, becoming President Roosevelt's veritable "Vice President." However, when he took office as Secretary of State last June, he was not completely lacking in knowledge of international issues. He accompanied the late President to the Yalta Conference, where his shorthand notes served as a reliable guidebook for his leader.

Allen

A few weeks ago, a friend of President Truman said, "Don't just think of George E. Allen as a jester. He is a good-natured man with a lot of humor, but he also takes things seriously. He is an excellent liberal, a good businessman, and he knows how to solve various problems. He will get a good position. You wait and see!"

This prediction has largely come true, and he was soon appointed to a prominent position in a Senate committee. When his appointment was announced, people snickered and expressed doubts about him, but soon the malicious snickers turned into kind smiles, and Allen's humorous demeanor made his doubters cast their votes of confidence for him. Allen's supporters had long anticipated this victory because his witty remarks and cheerful personality have been of interest to the Washington political scene for more than a decade. He is not only good at socializing, but also has discerning ability.

Among his friends are prominent figures in the government, such as the late President Roosevelt, most cabinet members, and important figures in both houses of Congress. At the same time, he has a solid position in the business world. In 1944, he was a "Trumanite" in Chicago. According to general rumors, it was Allen who guided Mr. Truman into the White House when Mr. Truman took office as President last April, although he flatly denies this.

Allen is a resourceful, problem-solving, and helpful person. He is involved in almost every secret speech delivered by the President. He is a confidential messenger in the White House. His recent mission was to investigate the management of wartime agencies for President Truman. He is a must-have guest on the President's yacht during weekend trips. The card game will not start until he arrives.

News Secretary with Keen Judgment

Ross

President Truman's Press Secretary Charles G. Ross is probably more valued than any of his predecessors. This position has always been regarded as a liaison office through which news from the White House is transmitted to the public. Ross helps produce the news. He often sits around a table with the President and his advisors, participating in important policy discussions.

Ross was the smartest student in his class when he studied at Independence High School, graduating with the highest honors. Truman admired him very much, and has done so for forty years. The President values his old friend's extensive knowledge, rich experience as a reporter and editor for twenty years, and his keen judgment of people. Ross is a tall and slightly hunchbacked man with a worried and gloomy expression on his face. His thin face and his unwavering loyalty to President Truman are reminiscent of the late Hopkins.

Veteran Cabinet Member with Admirable Humility

Hannegan

Postmaster General Robert E. Hannegan is a newly added senior advisor in the White House. Although he is a veteran cabinet member and a Missourian, he has never been placed in President Truman's circle of close friends. Indeed, he still hasn't. When Truman ran for senator in 1940, the two men had fallen out, and that's one thing. They never agreed on anything in discussions of party policy, and that's another thing. In such situations, it was often President Truman who made concessions, and that is why Hannegan was able to occupy a seat in the inner circle of the White House. After many turbulent meetings, Truman found that most of his subordinates, regardless of their merits or demerits, had become political liabilities. Since then, Hannegan, in his capacity as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has participated in various strategy planning meetings and often expressed many opinions on the appointment of new people. Hannegan was appointed as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by President Roosevelt in 1943. From then on, he quickly rose to prominence. In January of the following year, the Democratic National Committee elected him as the chairman of the committee. (24th)

### The Mud of Changsha

— Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli, by Air Mail from this Newspaper on the 18th

"Four Battles and One Fire" have caused Changsha to undergo several vicissitudes. Although it has been seven months since its recovery, the scars have not been slightly washed away. Wherever you go, the traces of the war are still evident. Several stone-paved asphalt roads are full of bullet holes, bumpy and uneven. The municipal authorities have mobilized Japanese prisoners to repair them, but because they lack tools and materials, they have only added some mud. After the rain, the streets are still muddy, making it even more difficult to walk than if they were not repaired.

Garbage Relocation Fees Increase the Severity of the Housing Shortage

The central work of the municipal authorities seems to be focused on opening up sources of revenue. In recent months, house taxes, banquet taxes, and slaughter taxes have all been the focus of public discussion. Therefore, all the work of tidying up the city's appearance has been neglected. Garbage is everywhere. The Provincial Health Department has estimated that garbage occupies 40% of the total area of Changsha. The fire grounds are no longer grounds, but small hills. If you are the owner of that piece of land and are preparing to build a house, you will first have to pay a garbage relocation fee of more than one million. This small problem makes it impossible for houses in Changsha to increase rapidly, thus exacerbating the housing shortage.

The impassability of the ditches makes it difficult to walk in the city after rain. The enemy occupied Changsha for more than a year and paid no attention to municipal administration. Eighty percent of the sewers are blocked. The municipal authorities are limited by manpower and financial resources and have no way to deal with it. They have no choice but to entrust this important work to the people themselves. Therefore, merchants in various streets have voluntarily raised funds to repair them. There has indeed been a lot of construction in recent months, but there is a lack of overall planning. If it is open here but blocked there, it is as good as not repairing it.

Many Military and Civilian Corpses Buried in Fire Ground Garbage Dumps

During the Fourth Battle of Changsha, many soldiers and civilians in the city were martyred, especially during the period when the enemy occupied the city, and many people were killed by the enemy. These corpses were buried in the fire grounds and garbage dumps. Various charitable organizations in Changsha organized a Military and Civilian Remains Collection and Burial Committee to be responsible for handling the matter. After three months of excavation and burial, more than 3,000 bodies have been exhumed in the urban area, but in fact, I am afraid there are still some that have not been discovered, and there are many places where unexploded bombs remain. Therefore, people living in the urban area are wary, fearing that disaster will arise from within, and at the same time, with the arrival of summer, they are afraid of the spread of plague. Families who are too cautious have even moved to the countryside to live to ensure safety.

Rent of Ten Piculs of Rice Only Rents a Three-Bay House

"It is not easy to live in Changsha." Not only is there the threat of environmental hygiene, but the pressure of food and housing makes people unable to breathe. Although the price of houses in Changsha is not calculated in gold bars like in Shanghai, but in rice as the standard, a small room costs at least one picul of rice per month, and three months or half a year must be prepaid. An ordinary house with three bays costs ten piculs of rice per month. Public school teachers at the middle and lower levels are constantly complaining. Although the municipal government has a rent evaluation committee, it does not have any effect. The food problem has still not been solved. From the end of February, the price of medium-grade rice at 27,000 to 28,000 yuan per picul was only stable for a month and a half. On April 12, it rose sharply again, increasing by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per day. After three days of rising prices, today (April 15) the price of rice is already 45,000 yuan per picul. It is said that a large number of troops are gathering in the Bin Hu area, consuming a lot of food, and there is a lack of food in southern Hunan, so merchants are rushing to Changsha to buy it. The provincial and municipal authorities have not yet announced any measures to deal with this surge in food prices. The People's Grain Company, which was established earlier, transported thousands of piculs of grain from Bin Hu. It is said that it will hold a fair price sale in Changsha, but I am afraid it will not become a reality in the near future.

Chairman Chiang Approved Additional Allocations for Hunan Agricultural Loans and Food Loans

The good news brought back by Mr. Zhao Yanwu from Chongqing also could not suppress the price of food. Mr. Zhao made urgent appeals to the central government and various parties in Chongqing for the Hunan disaster and received enthusiastic responses. Chairman Chiang approved an additional allocation of 100 million yuan for Hunan agricultural loans, 50 million yuan for food loans, and 50,000 bags of wheat flour, and the Ministry of Food allocated 200,000 piculs of grain each from Sichuan and Jiangxi to help Hunan. If this huge amount of money and materials can arrive in the short term, then perhaps things will be better during the time when the green and yellow crops are not yet available. However, judging from the current traffic situation, 400,000 piculs of grain from Sichuan and Jiangxi cannot be transported in the short term.

Farewell Parties Held for Days for the Reorganization of the Provincial Government

The reorganization of the provincial government had been rumored constantly in Changsha before it finally materialized. No one had any special feelings about Wang Lai's departure. Mr. Wu Wusheng governed Hunan for eight months, and only the common people understand his spirit of inaction. Although Mr. Wang Dongyuan governed Hunan as a person from Anhui, Mr. Wang had served in the military in Hunan for many years and knew the situation in Hunan well, so perhaps he could do it more effectively. Mr. Wu is preparing to hand over, and farewell parties from all walks of life are being held every day.

Hu Mai, the former Director of Finance, was accused of corruption not long after he left office, and the local court's procuratorate is investigating the matter. Twenty or thirty officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Field Tax and Grain Management have been summoned, and Mr. Hu himself has also been summoned twice. The person in charge of the local court said that he will handle the matter according to the law. It is said that Mr. Hu was accused of misappropriating the surplus distribution case of the employee welfare society during his tenure as the Director of the Field Grain Department, the surplus case of grain processing, and the grain allocation case. All newspapers reported that Mr. Hu had paid a bail of 10 million yuan and would be available at any time.

New Company Established to Engage in Export Business of Local Products

Hunan's special products such as tea, tung oil, summer cloth, and firecrackers have always been important materials for export. In recent years, due to the war, sales have been slow and production has declined sharply, causing serious damage to the rural economy. Li Yuyao, Director of the Department of Construction, Liu Xuru, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, and famous figures in the industrial and commercial sectors such as Chen Zhitian and Cui Bohong have initiated the organization of the Hunan Local Products Trade Association to be responsible for promoting sales and improving production. Mr. Chen and Mr. Cui also initiated the establishment of the Hunan Local Products Trade Company with a capital of 100 million yuan to specialize in the export business of Hunan local products. This is indeed aimed at Hunan's needs, and the rural areas of Hunan can also be revived through this.

Only One-Tenth of the 1,000 Allocated Vehicles Are Available

However, whether it is the reorganization of the provincial government or the development of export trade to revive the rural areas, the problem is still transportation. If transportation cannot be quickly and smoothly connected, everything will still fail. Ling Hongxun, Deputy Minister of Transportation, inspected the reconstruction project of the Yuehan Railway and said to reporters in Changsha: "The bridges along the line have been severely damaged and there is an excessive lack of vehicles. Although the completion of the pontoon bridge will allow the passage of large trains, but if you want smooth transportation, you must wait for the vehicles ordered abroad to arrive." The highway situation is also a lack of vehicles. The Fourth Route Army received 5,000 enemy vehicles and transferred them to Shen Dake, the representative of the Wartime Camel Transport Bureau. The Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau allocated 1,000 vehicles at Shen's representative office, but only one-tenth of them are usable. The rest are just a pile of scrap iron. How can this increase highway transportation?

Director Hawkins Cares About the Suffering of the People of Hunan

Recently, what the people of Changsha miss is Mr. Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins was originally the Director of the UNRRA Office in Hunan. He had been to Lingling, Qiyang, Shaoyang, Pingjiang, Liuyang and other places to survey disasters and was very sympathetic to the suffering of the people of Hunan. He had also strived to increase the amount of materials and transport them to Hunan for relief. It is said that Mr. Hawkins contributed the most to the case of the central government approving the exemption of 2 million piculs of military grain from Hunan. Therefore, the people of Hunan miss Mr. Ha Min's departure very much. In the midst of it, he felt a strong unease. In a dispute that he did not fully understand, he unfortunately "got caught in the middle," which made him think of returning to the quiet place in the vice president's office of the First National Bank of St. Louis.

In April 1945, President Truman called him out of this quiet place and successively appointed him as the Director of the Federal Loan Administration and the Director of the Wartime Mobilization and Reconversion Bureau. Although he encountered various difficult problems and although the possibility of him getting rid of some heavy responsibilities was increasing day by day, he still enjoyed President Du's strong trust.

To say that Snyder is President Truman's outstanding economic advisor is tantamount to saying that he is an advisor on general domestic policy. Even if he is not the one providing the advice, he is at least the main medium for conveying it. He himself is not an economist, and his views in this regard are very conservative. Ten days ago, President Truman accepted his proposal to resolve the steel dispute, and President Truman's trust in him has deepened.

Diplomatic Newbie with Strong Skills

Byrnes

The advice provided by President Truman's close advisors is mostly not limited to specialized areas of activity. Secretary of State Byrnes is especially so. President Truman values his clever mind, which can be applied in almost any situation. He knows the intricacies of government activities "perhaps more thoroughly than anyone in Washington." Although Byrnes is a newcomer to diplomatic issues in all aspects, he is still an excellent advisor in this area, occasionally getting help from Chief of Staff Admiral Leahy.

Assuming that at the Democratic National Convention held in Chicago in June 1944, the "wheel of fate" had turned in the other direction, then

### Visiting Dr. Ma Yinchu on the Banks of West Lake to Discuss the Future of Economic Development

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, from this Newspaper on the 24th, Hangzhou

Anyone who cares about economic issues probably knows Dr. Ma Yinchu, who studies economics. During the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Ma taught in the rear. After the victory, he went from Chongqing to Shanghai, and then hurriedly from Shanghai to Hangzhou. Mr. Ma's hometown is Shaoxing. In Hangzhou, he has a comfortable Western-style house on Fayuan Road, and he has a happy family. Although he is already 65 years old, his plump face and loud voice make people think he is only 48 or 49 years old. He returned to Hangzhou to see his home and planned to rest on the long-separated West Lake.

The People of Hangzhou Welcome Dr. Ma

The people of Hangzhou warmly welcome Mr. Ma. Almost every day someone asks him to give a speech. All walks of life in Hangzhou held a welcome party for him. When the reporter interviewed Mr. Ma at his residence at No. 34 Fayuan Road, he was busy preparing for a speech.

He is an amiable person, and from his cheerful and lively tone, you can also see that he is a very sincere and upright elder. He and Mr. Kong Xiangxi were classmates, and Mr. Song Ziwen's father taught him English. There could be no better friendship. However, based on economic theory and in the spirit of the Spring and Autumn Annals' criticism of the worthy, he unceremoniously criticized the current measures. In the current era, this kind of criticism is indeed necessary.

He Proposed Five New Proposals

He told the reporter that he had five proposals: First, bureaucratic capital must be eradicated. Second, a certain system is not very good, but its practitioners are often good. He said: "Most of the staff I have seen are very good young people. They are also very diligent, and some of their writings even exceed the level of university graduates." Therefore, he advocated that after a certain system is abolished, a way out should be sought for these good young people. This way out should be the responsibility of those who made money from the national crisis, the victory, and even the spies. They should take out money to run industries so that many good young people can have normal jobs.

The Founding Father Taught that Everyone Should Have Food to Eat

Third, political democracy must precede economic democracy, because everything is built on the economy. If economic democracy is not achieved, political democracy is still empty talk. Regarding economic democracy, he admired the Founding Father's motto: "Everyone should have food to eat." He said: It is not right for everyone to have food to eat, because this lacks the meaning of production and makes it so that one eats and does nothing. "Everyone should have food to eat" contains the meaning of production. He advocated that bureaucratic capital must be abolished so that everyone can work for economic initiative. Fourth, convene a national economic conference. He believed that the economic conference should not only be within the scope of the President and Ministers, but should bring together leaders from industry, agriculture, and commerce, as well as economic experts from all over the country, to discuss matters sincerely.

A Way Out Should Be Arranged for Laid-Off Soldiers

Fifth, he advocated that economic issues should be planned comprehensively. The issue of foreign exchange should be linked to financial issues, because if the government prints money indiscriminately, the exchange rate will still have to change after it is set. However, the financial issue is related to the issue of military consolidation. If military expenditure is huge, currency cannot be contracted. He said: It is possible for finance if the national army is reduced to 50 divisions and the communist army is reduced to 10 divisions. However, the issue of military consolidation is related to industrial policy, because the soldiers who are laid off should have a proper way out. Their way out should be industry. But industrial policy must be decided on tariff protection policy. He said: Britain and the United States regard China as a market, so they do not advocate a tariff protection policy. But our industrial foundation is too fragile. If we do not adopt tariff protection, then this little industry will be completely destroyed. Therefore, he extremely advocated a tariff protection policy. Mr. Ma talked about the above issues all

Find a Way Out to Coordinate Industry and Agriculture

Mr. Ma talked about the above issues with a smile, because he firmly believed that China would definitely have hope.

After he finished speaking, I asked him about the issue of industrial coordination with agriculture that he advocated. He said: "I advocate equal emphasis on industry and agriculture, so industry should be coordinated with agriculture." I said: "Some people say that if industry is coordinated with agriculture, the purchasing power of farmers is not enough." He said again: "For example, if we run a textile factory, we don't have to buy foreign cotton. If we buy foreign cotton, Chinese cotton will have no way out. If you weave cloth and sell it to farmers, the farmers will naturally not be able to afford it. If we buy domestic cotton, the farmers will have money, and they can buy your cloth." Therefore, he advocated that Chinese factories should purchase Chinese raw materials as soon as possible. He also advocated that domestic factories (light industry) should be encouraged to be privately run so that they have competition and progress. It is not right for officials to compete with the people.

The Nine Eastern Provinces Should Be Well Developed

I also asked him about his views on the Northeast issue from the standpoint of economics. His answer was: "The Northeast is an industrial area, and there could be no better place. People should not fight each other again, but should develop it well. It doesn't matter if the Soviet Union takes away the machines, but it's terrible if they want our underground treasures." He was extremely concerned about the Sino-Soviet cooperation in developing the Northeast's resources, which is being discussed.

Zhejiang Province Plans to Develop Agriculture

While we were talking, Mrs. Ma came out. She is a virtuous and dignified lady. She was preparing to accompany Mr. Ma to give a speech. I also took Mr. Ma's car back. In the car, I asked him: How should Zhejiang's economic future develop? He said: "There are few treasures under the ground in Zhejiang, and almost all of them are on the ground, so we can only seek development in agriculture. Zhejiang's silk and tea have a very promising future, but we must improve them well and work hard. In the future, when agriculture is developed, we can exchange agricultural products for industrial products."

During our pleasant conversation, I praised Mr. Ma's health. He told me that his life is regular. He takes a cold shower every morning and a hot shower every afternoon. He reads and eats at a fixed time.

He sent the car to the front of our office. We parted ways here. (Sent from Hangzhou on April 24)

### Keqiang College

### Declaration of the Shanghai Music Cooperation Association

We—the colleagues of the Shanghai music community—have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Music Association to unite friends in the Shanghai music community and jointly promote the future music movement in Shanghai.

In terms of quantity and quality, Shanghai's musical talent occupies a significant advantage nationwide. Many performers and composers have the opportunity to be nurtured here. There are orchestras, music schools, and all kinds of good material conditions. The world's most outstanding performers, if they pass through China, will perform in Shanghai. This is a zone for the exchange of Chinese and foreign cultures, a breeding ground for the development of Chinese music. It has been so in the past, and it will be so in the future.

However, Shanghai musicians do not seem to have made the contributions they should have, nor have they reached the level of performance they should have. It is not that we individually lack lofty ideals or correct beliefs; every musician possesses these from the beginning of their studies. What are our ideals and beliefs? Simply put, we are willing to use the skills, musical knowledge, and learning we have acquired to enhance human happiness and make life more fulfilling and enriching. We believe that no art is more suitable than music to beautify life and sublimate the human spirit or soul. If we narrow the scope to the standpoint of the nation, we urgently demand the creation of new Chinese music, so that the backward Chinese music can evolve rapidly and stand its ground in the general trend of world music in a short period of time.

However, we are very ashamed that, in the entire Chinese music movement, our performance and our contributions are weak and insignificant. Why? Bringing up this question immediately yields an answer: we have not united our individual forces, we have not combined all our lofty ideals and good beliefs into a vibrant, surging, and courageous force, advancing toward a great goal. In the past, we have been too scattered, too lacking in mutual assistance, too lacking in enthusiasm, so that individual efforts have all fallen flat.

Among all the arts, music is the most collective art. An orchestra is an aggregate of multiple instruments, and harmony is an aggregate of multiple intervals. Only by bringing together all the scattered sounds can music be created, and only by bringing together multiple musical talents can the function of music be brought into play. Therefore, there must be an organization to unite the Shanghai music community and concentrate the scattered forces.

The Shanghai Music Association was born out of this urgent need, and we celebrate its establishment with great enthusiasm.

We would like to briefly mention the direction of future work: First, there is the issue of raising and popularizing what is contended for in literary and artistic theory. We believe that this is just two sides of a complete object; lacking any one side would destroy the integrity of the object. We will simultaneously work to take both aspects into account, so that enhancement and popularization develop in a balanced manner.

We plan to promote singing in Shanghai, so that those who love to sing can unite, organize choirs, and composer friends can write more songs for everyone to sing. From the singing movement will gradually emerge a new Chinese opera.

Secondly, we will have some friends specially engaged in folk song research and recording. Chinese folk songs are extremely rich and varied. On this vast land of China, they are the voice of the people, they represent the soul of the people, and the new music of China will directly grow and flourish based on folk songs.

In terms of learning, we want to establish a music library, so that learners will not have the distress of lacking books.

An orchestra will be quickly established, which can regularly introduce world masterpieces, especially new works by domestic composers.

To describe other details would go beyond the scope of this article. The Shanghai Music Association has been established, and at the same time, we hope that colleagues in the music community across the country will unite, respond to us, and promote new Chinese music with the strength of the entire nation.

A small boat is thus launched into the turbulent sea. We hope that friends all over the world will help us with friendly hands, urge us, and encourage us.

### Drastic Price Fluctuations Last Week: Commodity Stocks Rise in Tandem, Urgent Need for Effective Measures

Last week, commodity prices in this city experienced another sharp surge, with rice prices exceeding the 40,000 mark, having a significant impact. Although the authorities have closely supervised the situation, it has not been effective in practice. Gold prices have remained relatively stable under the control of the Central Bank of China (CBC), but the U.S. dollar has surged far above its official exchange rate. Chinese and foreign stocks, as well as consolidated bonds, have seen prices rise due to rumors of the reopening of the stock exchange, stimulating investor sentiment. Stockbrokers have seized the opportunity to engage in activities, spreading baseless rumors to drive up prices on the black market for stocks. Government bonds have also reached record highs. Other commodities, such as flour, fried dough sticks, yarn, cotton, sugar, and silk, have all increased in price. If this continues, the future of people's livelihoods is truly unimaginable. The market situation last week is summarized as follows:

Gold

Buyers remained cautious, and short sellers were active. From Monday to Friday, prices fluctuated between 1.56 million and 1.59 million, with a slightly bearish trend. However, on Saturday, the market improved due to the transfer of speculative funds from other sectors. The price rose from 1.575 million to 1.59 million. Although it briefly fell to 1.575 million, it ultimately reached 1.6005 million yuan, exceeding 1.6 million yuan.

Foreign Currencies

The CBC's exchange rate of 2020 remained unchanged, but the U.S. dollar was exceptionally strong. It fluctuated between a low of 2140 and a high of 2380 throughout the week. Because the U.S. dollar could be used for foreign exchange settlements, foreign merchants frequently bought it up, and the supply was limited. Further speculative activity by speculators also contributed to its strong performance, with arbitrage trading becoming common.

Government Bonds

Although the authorities have strictly prohibited speculation in consolidated bonds, speculators still hold onto the rumor of a 120-fold repayment of principal. The government's policy on pre-war national debt has not yet been clearly announced, leading to various speculations in the market. Amidst the speculation, investor sentiment has been high. On the black market, Class C bonds started at 5,700 on Monday, gradually rising. From Tuesday to Thursday, they hovered around 6,100 yuan. On Friday, they jumped from 6,000 yuan to 6,900 yuan. On Saturday, they broke the 7,000 yuan barrier, reaching 7,400 yuan, with a high of 7,600 yuan.

Stocks

Chinese stocks initially strengthened but then weakened. The morning opened with active trading on a next-day delivery basis. Subsequently, as floating profits were taken, the market became volatile and declined. On Tuesday, the market initially continued to rise, but then weakened as large investors exited. Frequent short covering occurred in the afternoon, leading to a recovery. As a result, large stocks were little changed from the previous day, while Qinxing, Jingfu, and Xinguang experienced slight declines. The market remained relatively stable on Wednesday, but uncertainty prevailed, leading to a decline of 100 yuan in two large stocks. On Thursday, under strict regulation, investor sentiment was cautious, and the market was sluggish with limited trading. On Friday, six large investors absorbed the previous week's downward trend. Due to CBC control, prices were strong. With rumors of the imminent reopening of the stock exchange, prices rose uniformly.

Foreign stocks initially experienced ups and downs, but ultimately rose sharply as Jewish merchants vigorously covered short positions. Jardine Matheson and Union Insurance both exceeded the 15,000 yuan mark. On Tuesday, as Jardine Matheson and Union Brewery reached their target prices for bullish foreign companies, retail investors, wary of high prices, began to exit, causing the market to decline after halting its rise. Prices declined by about 100 yuan each, except for Jardine Matheson, which remained unchanged. On Wednesday, trading was suspended under strict government supervision, and the prices quoted off-market were slightly weaker, with trading being slow. On Thursday, constrained by the environment, prices fell further. On Friday, trading was slightly more active in secret, and prices rose in buying. Jardine Matheson, Union Insurance, and Wheelock Marden each increased by 500 yuan. With news of the stock exchange reopening, investor sentiment was optimistic, and prices rose uniformly.

Grains

At the beginning of the week, the rice market saw ample supply but slow trading. Prices remained unchanged except for foreign indica rice, which increased by 500 yuan. The flour market was strong, with Cannon and Warship brands increasing by 500 yuan. The prices of miscellaneous brands rose even more sharply, with Peacock and Train brands increasing by 800 to 1,000 yuan. Due to exports, Pinghu coarse beans rose by approximately 3,000 yuan, with other varieties also rising by 1,000 yuan. In terms of cooking oil, Qingdao barrel raw oil rose by 2,000 yuan, and soybean oil rose by 4,500 yuan. Sugar demand decreased sharply, and prices remained stable, with only Xinghua white sugar rising by 4,000 yuan, while the rest maintained their original prices. On Tuesday, rice prices fell, each variety dropping by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend. The flour market remained strong, with Warship and Chrysanthemum brands continuing to rise by 2,000 yuan. Cooking oil and sugar also rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan each due to limited supply and high demand. On Wednesday, the rice market, which was initially weak, became active again, and the market trend became firm. Sugar prices also strengthened, with medium-grade sugar rising by 3,000 yuan. On Thursday, grain, cooking oil, and sugar prices experienced a comprehensive surge. Rice prices rose again by 1,500 yuan due to high prices at the production area. Flour prices quoted off-market rose by thousands of yuan. Soybeans rose by 500 yuan, raw kernels rose by 1,500 yuan, and cooking oil sales were strong, rising by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sugar prices also became firm. On Friday, the rice market was chaotic. Due to the insistence of cargo owners, the market rose sharply, with japonica and indica rice each increasing by approximately 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The flour market also rose sharply as buyers continued to purchase it, rising by about 10%. Miscellaneous grains also rose sharply. Cooking oil was in short supply and rose by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The sugar market was buoyant, with medium-grade sugar rising by nearly 10,000 yuan due to competition among buyers. On Saturday, the rice market opened flat but then became chaotic. As a result, japonica and indica rice each rose by 10%. The prices of flour quoted off-market were even more chaotic, rising by approximately 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Cooking oil also rose sharply, with barrel raw oil closing at 70,000 yuan, and soybean oil rising sharply, reaching 16,000 yuan.

Raw Yarn

In the past week, the market was stagnant due to ample raw yarn inventory in Shanghai and average actual sales to buyers. Later, with the surge in gold and stocks, the environment was favorable for bullish positions. Actual demand from Tianjin and Guangdong increased, and market prices soared. Fengliu No. 6 experienced the strongest increase, reaching a high of 1.77 million yuan for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn on Saturday and a low of 600,000 yuan for 10-count Tongxin yarn on Monday. In terms of count, 10-count Tongxin yarn rose the most, by 140,000 yuan, followed by 32-count Phoenix yarn, which rose by 115,000 yuan, and 20-count Shuangma yarn, which rose by 100,000 yuan. Other yarns rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

Fabric Market

The market was initially weak, but then improved along with the stock market and yarn prices. As a result, grey twill rose by 4,000 yuan, while other brands rose by approximately 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Cotton Market

Private factories and industry colleagues continued to purchase cotton, and the market trend continued to rise. Miter cotton delivered to factories has reached 92,000 yuan. As a result, the prices of various types of cotton increased by 5,000 to 8,000 yuan compared to the previous week.

Silk

The artificial silk market was very stable at the beginning of the week. From Wednesday, 120-count Tianqiao brand rose by 100,000 yuan. On Friday, it rose by another 100,000 yuan. Compared to Monday, it had risen by 250,000 yuan by the end of the week. The prices of miscellaneous brands remained approximately 100,000 yuan apart from the Tianqiao brand. 75-count semi-gloss yarn rose by 180,000 yuan in a week. The reason for the sharp increase was that buyers purchased it, and non-industry personnel also collected it. Factories were relatively quiet last week. There were no significant fluctuations until Thursday. From Friday, prices suddenly rose. 85-count high-uniformity silk rose by 200,000 yuan in total, 78-count high-uniformity silk rose by 100,000 yuan, ordinary silk rose by 150,000 yuan, and thousand-thread silk rose by 100,000 yuan. The silk fabric market saw strong buying interest from Wednesday, mostly for speculative purposes, leading to a price increase. The price of Meya bedding rose sharply by 200,000 yuan within two days, Wednesday and Thursday. By the end of the week, it had weakened, rising by a total of 200,000 yuan in a week. The price of Dacheng plaid crepe rose by 700 yuan by Friday, but fell back by 100 yuan at the end of the week, rising by a total of slightly less than 600 yuan last week.

### Authorities Confer on Maintaining Food Supply: Ban on Flour Exports and Implement Four Emergency Measures

The recent surge in grain prices, with white rice exceeding 40,000 yuan, has set an unprecedented record. Concerned authorities recognize the seriousness of the situation and have convened meetings to discuss countermeasures for days. It has been learned that Premier Song met with Minister of Food Xu Kan and Mayor Qian Dajun yesterday morning for a lengthy discussion and decided to take the following emergency measures: (1) immediately consult with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to expedite the shipment of large quantities of food purchased from Myanmar and other places to Shanghai; (2) closely monitor illegal activities such as hoarding and speculation, and severely punish unscrupulous merchants who manipulate the market; (3) sell off all the food stored by the enemy and puppet regimes in a short period of time; (4) instruct the Jianghai Customs to "allow only flour transported by UNRRA for relief purposes to be transshipped from Shanghai, and prohibit any other organizations or individuals from transshipping flour for export." It is also learned that Li Du, Chief Secretary of the Jianghai Customs, issued a notice yesterday to ban the transshipment of flour in accordance with the instructions.

According to a senior official in the city's grain administration, the Executive Yuan recently convened relevant grain administration agencies to discuss and request that UNRRA allocate 209,000 tons of relief rice to China and have it shipped to China in August of this year. At the same time, personnel will be sent to Siam and Canada to purchase foreign rice and ship it back to the country to alleviate the food shortage.

### Mercury Prices Fall Universally

[Reuters, London, 28th] The recent drop in mercury prices on the world market is due to Italian and Spanish producers selling off their inventories. Spain is eager to obtain foreign exchange, especially U.S. dollars. Whether the controlled price of mercury in the United Kingdom will fall as a result remains to be seen. The supply department currently has 10,000 to 12,000 large bottles of mercury, enough for one year of use. The majority of this mercury was purchased at prices higher than the current market price, which may slow down the price decline in the United Kingdom.

### Flat-Priced Soap

Approximately 30,000 Boxes

Distributed and Sold by Tobacco Exchange Merchants

The Bureau for the Disposition of Enemy and Puppet Properties in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions will allocate a large quantity of soap to over 2,600 tobacco exchange stores for flat-priced sale. The soap includes brands such as Xiangmao, Meihua, Zhu Sheng, Five Star, Niu Pai, Mingxing, and Henry, with a total quantity of approximately 30,000 boxes. Category C and D members of the tobacco exchange industry can withdraw the goods from the association immediately.

### Analysis of the Reasons for the Surge in Chinese Stocks

Chinese stock trading has been banned from speculation since mid-February, and there is no public trading. However, clandestine activities are still rampant. The rise in prices since the ban reflects the extent to which clandestine activities are fueling speculation. Since last week, the authorities have dispatched police to strictly enforce the ban, making it difficult for speculative investors to operate, resulting in a temporary weakening trend. However, after Finance Minister Yu arrived in Shanghai and made a statement to reporters, generally nervous investors took this as a positive sign and absorbed large quantities of stocks. At the same time, rumors spread that powerful figures in the industry were lobbying the authorities to resume trading. As a result, the upward trend in prices began to emerge on Friday afternoon of last week, and by the weekend, there was a dramatic surge, with the two major stocks and three smaller stocks closing at new high prices. The percentage increase in prices compared to Monday is as follows:

Note: Closing price is based on selling price

According to the table, Shensin Garment accounted for the highest percentage increase at 16%, followed by Meya Silk Factory at 14%. The former was due to its own price increase before the shareholders' meeting in the middle of last week, resulting in a high base. The latter, among the so-called two major stocks, was engineered to create a speculative frenzy by large investors, exceeding the increase of Wing On Textile Factory.

The reason for the rise in Chinese stocks is due to speculative funds, allowing speculative large investors to do as they please, manipulating the market at will. The stimulus of the imminent resumption of the stock exchange further fueled the fire. Generally, it is believed that the resumption of the stock exchange will transform illegal transactions into legal trading, and after the stock exchange is restored, some of the manufacturers' stocks will be approved for listing and circulation. Therefore, in the upward trend, even unpopular stocks are favored by buyers. Chinese stocks are originally investment businesses, but now they have become speculative targets. Since they are speculative targets, it is difficult to correlate price increases with asset standards. The recent sudden surge is considered normal by stock players. At this stage, unless speculative funds are diverted to legitimate channels, the stock market frenzy may continue to be staged. (Dehui)

### U.S. Cotton Dumping Plan Will Continue

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 27th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on April 25 that its plan to increase cotton exports will continue until June 30, 1947. The method is to supply cotton to exporters at different prices, even lower than domestic prices.

### 139 Category A Foreign Exchange Operating Firms Approved

The government promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange by the Central Bank on February 25. Subsequently, the bank designated 29 Chinese and foreign banks in the city as designated banks to operate foreign exchange business. Other financial institutions may also apply to be Category A operating firms in accordance with the provisions of the measures. By the end of last month, over 100 banks, money shops, and trust companies in the city had applied to the office to be Category A operating firms. After careful research and setting standards, each application was reviewed several times. The approval was issued by President Bei of the bank. A total of 139 firms were approved. The banks and money shops have been notified to bring the official receipts issued by the bank, signed and sealed by the person in charge, to the Foreign Exchange Examination Office at 15 Zhongshan Road, Section 1, before the end of this month to collect their certificates. In the future, banks and money shops with certificates can operate the buying and selling of foreign currency banknotes in accordance with the regulations and must comply with the Interim Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange. Those without certificates have been publicly announced by the Central Bank and will be prohibited from operating the buying and selling of foreign currency banknotes from May 1.

### Deadline for Counterfeit Currency Registration

12 Billion Circulating Among the People

After the deadline of March 30 for the exchange of counterfeit reserve coupons for legal tender, the deadline for holders of counterfeit reserve coupons who were unable to exchange them on time due to time and location constraints to register with the Central Bank is today (29th). However, as of yesterday, only 4 or 5 people have registered. According to the bank's register of collected counterfeit currency, the total amount of counterfeit currency issued was over 419.9 billion. As of today, the total amount of counterfeit currency collected and exchanged was 407.9 billion yuan, leaving 12 billion yuan of counterfeit currency circulating.

### Expected to Export 130,000 Bales of Japanese Silk This Year

[Reuters, New York, 28th] Although the start of Japanese silk exports has been delayed, officials believe that the target of exporting 130,000 bales this year will be achieved. Recently, two ships carrying approximately 5,000 bales of silk have departed from Japan.

### Difficult to Restore Trade in Southeast Asia, Slack Trade Between Shanghai and Hong Kong

After the war, trade between Shanghai and Southeast Asia has been extremely limited, far from pre-war levels. According to people in the import and export industry, the main reasons are: (1) transportation is difficult, and cargo is obstructed; (2) since the currency system in Singapore and other places has stabilized, various goods are much cheaper than in Shanghai due to price controls by local governments; (3) the delay in hypothecation often means that the goods have arrived but the bill of lading has not yet arrived, making it impossible to unload the goods and incurring undue losses. Due to the above three reasons, many Southeast Asian merchants are unwilling to place orders in Shanghai. In particular, the third reason causes too much loss. Even export goods transported to Southeast Asia are now mostly exported through Hong Kong. However, trade between Shanghai and Hong Kong is also stagnant. The reasons are as follows: (1) there is only one fixed ship per month between Shanghai and Hong Kong; (2) in the past, the main exports from Shanghai to Hong Kong were textiles, followed by metal materials and medicines. Now that the Jianghai Customs has banned the export of textiles, trade with Guangdong merchants and overseas Chinese merchants has become even more bleak; (3) it takes one month for remittances between Shanghai and Hong Kong, and merchants are limited by funds and the price fluctuations of goods in Shanghai, making it unprofitable to them. Therefore, everyone remains on the sidelines.

### Difficult to Export Fujian Native Products, Shipping Costs 80,000 Times Higher Than Before the War

[Fuzhou News] Foreign trade here has come to a standstill. Exporters have no way to transport goods to other places for sale because shipping costs are too high, resulting in losses in most cases. It is learned that the current average shipping cost is 80,000 yuan per ton, and private ships require 100,000 yuan, which is 80,000 times higher than the pre-war index. This multiple is only found in the prices of general commodities. Two or three months ago, native products such as bananas, fruits, and timber were popular in the Shanghai market for a while. The official price surged, reaching a peak of 165,000 yuan per ton. In particular, timber sales were strong, and the fee was collected in a disguised form as a "70/30" split, meaning that no shipping fee was collected here, but after the goods were sold in Shanghai, 70% of the proceeds were taken as the shipping fee, and the cargo owner only received 30%. Recently, prices in Shanghai have fallen, and prices here have risen. The wholesale market prices of native products are not far from the Shanghai market situation. Merchants are already feeling the burden of shipping costs. Except for those who must transport goods to Shanghai for sale, others dare not try to make unnecessary losses. Since the opening of the Taiwan Exchange Line, there have been no goods to load from Fujian to Taiwan because the shipping fee of 40,000 yuan per ton is too high. It is expected that under the current rigidity, shipping fees will fall in the near future, otherwise, the service will be discontinued.

### International Financial Group's Depository: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Monetary Fund Open Accounts with the New York Federal Reserve Bank

[United Press, New York, 27th] The New York Federal Reserve Bank has quietly opened accounts for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund under heavy security, creating a new era for international exchange. The first small deposits were not announced, but are estimated to be only in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and may increase to billions of dollars within a month. The United States alone has an obligation to deposit more than 3 billion dollars in cash and banknotes. The Federal Reserve Bank is a massive grey stone building, surrounded by skyscrapers. Although the headquarters of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund are located in Washington, the United States has designated the New York Federal Reserve Bank as its fiscal agent and depository, so most of its actual transactions are carried out here. Orders issued by the headquarters are executed by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, with some being transferred to central banks and depositories overseas. The entire procedure is extremely simple and eliminates the need to transport large amounts of gold and silver currency back and forth across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. According to officials at the Federal Reserve Bank, most member countries of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund have opened accounts. If there is a dollar transaction, it only needs to be transferred from one account to another. For example, if France purchases goods in the United States but temporarily lacks foreign exchange to pay, the Monetary Fund can sell 50 million U.S. dollars to the French bank, which will be transferred from the Monetary Fund's account to the French account. If the International Bank approves a long-term loan of 100 million yuan to India for construction, the same procedure can be used. The International Bank has 9.1 billion yuan in funds, and the Monetary Fund has 1.8 billion yuan. Its first board meeting is scheduled to be held in New York on May 6.

### Saccharin Rises Alone

Western Medicine Raw Materials Gradually Fall; Ciba Releases Two Batches of Goods

In recent weeks, the prices of Western medicines have gradually fallen due to the continuous arrival of goods, especially raw materials such as yellow and white petroleum jelly. Although saccharin has arrived, it has been hoarded by large investors. On the one hand, it is stimulated by the rising price of sugar, so it is rising day by day. In terms of prepared medicines, Ciba has already released the first batch of goods, so the price of that product has dropped significantly. It is said that Quchi Medicine will also release goods next week. If this is true, then the price of that product may also fall.

### Increased Rice Production in the Americas: This is How the Situation is

[Reuters, New York, 28th] According to agricultural sources, the area under rice cultivation in many countries in the Americas this year shows signs of breaking records. The U.S. rice production this year may reach 73 million U.S. bushels, which suggests a cultivation area of 1,575,000 acres.

### Pig Bristle Exports Gradually Improve: Tianjin Merchants Offer U.S. $5.6 Per Pound

[Tianjin News] Since the victory, only pig bristles have had a relatively large export volume in Tianjin. Before the war, the U.S. pig bristle market was dominated by China. After the war, South American and Indian pig bristle merchants shared the market due to the disruption of transportation. Sea transportation has recently resumed, so the export of Chinese pig bristles will become increasingly active. Recently, Tianjin exporters have offered U.S. merchants pig bristle prices through the intermediation of U.S. trading companies, including $5 (U.S. dollars) and $5.6 per pound. These prices are not higher than U.S. prices.

### The Minimum Wage Law: Its Formulation and Key Points

— Tian Heqing

Recently, due to the surge of labor movements, all parties have paid close attention to the issue of wages. Among them, the Minimum Wage Law, although not yet implemented, was actually promulgated as early as ten years ago. Now, I will select and introduce its formulation process and key points for reference.

The Minimum Wage Law is a common regulation adopted by various countries around the world when setting wages. In order to encourage universal adoption by its member states, the International Labour Office specifically proposed it as the first item on the agenda for discussion at the 11th Conference held in Geneva on May 30, 1928. It was unanimously passed, and several proposals for minimum wage measures were drafted into an international convention, in accordance with Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and similar provisions of other treaties. The draft convention was formulated on June 16, 1928, and sent to the member states of the International Labour Organization for ratification to become a formal convention. The National Government of China ratified it on February 28, 1930. According to the convention, ratification by member states becomes effective twelve months after registration by the Secretary-General of the International Labour Office. Therefore, in order to comply with the obligations of the convention, the National Government entrusted the Legislative Yuan to draft a Minimum Wage Law based on the principles stipulated in the "Convention on the Establishment of Minimum Wage Setting Machinery," and with reference to the minimum wage laws of other countries, consisting of a total of 23 articles. It was formally promulgated by the National Government on December 23, 1936, but to this day, it has not been ordered to be implemented.

The full text of the Minimum Wage Law is too long, so I will summarize the main points as follows:

(1) The most difficult problem in setting wages is how to determine a fair and reasonable wage? How to determine the minimum wage standard? According to Article 3 of the Minimum Wage Law, these most basic and troublesome issues are very clearly defined.

The article states: "The minimum wage rate should be determined based on the local cost of living and the conditions of workers in each industry, according to the following standards:

(1) For adult workers, the standard shall be to maintain their own necessary living expenses and to provide for two dependent relatives without working ability.

(2) The wages of child laborers shall not be lower than half of the adult minimum wage."

According to the above article, the minimum wage rate should be determined based on the local cost of living and the conditions of workers in each industry. The so-called local cost of living can be based on the worker's cost of living index published by the Shanghai Municipal Government every month. As for the conditions of workers in each industry, it usually refers to the technical skills and education level of workers in each industry. What should not be ignored is the position of the industry itself, such as prosperity, the amount of production, the strength of the employer, and international competition. All these issues should be carefully examined before a final decision can be made. In addition, the standard is already very clear in the article. However, one point to be emphasized is that the minimum wage rate is limited to the necessary living expenses for supporting three people, including the worker himself.

(2) The second key point is who will stipulate this minimum wage rate? According to Article 7 of the law:

"When the competent authority considers it necessary to stipulate a minimum wage for all or part of the workers in a certain industry, it shall solicit the opinions of both labor and management in that industry. It may then submit the proposed minimum wage rate to the Minimum Wage Committee for deliberation and approval by the superior competent authority, and then announce it after filing with the Ministry of Industry."

How is the Minimum Wage Committee organized? According to Article 8:

"The Minimum Wage Committee shall consist of nine to fifteen members, organized by the following personnel, whose candidates shall be reported by the competent authority to the superior competent authority and then reported to the Ministry of Industry for record":

1. One or two representatives of the competent authority
2. Three to five representatives from both labor and management
3. One person from both labor and management who has no direct interest and is familiar with the industry
4. One representative may be sent by the Ministry of Industry or the provincial competent authority if deemed necessary

Other matters, such as the board and lodging provided by the factory, may be included in the calculation of wages based on the average value of the most recent three months. Also, the minimum wage rate can only be modified in accordance with the law after being implemented for twelve months. All these are stipulated in detail in the law. It is hoped that the competent authorities and the legitimate organizations of both labor and management will promptly petition the National Government to order the implementation of the law nationwide on a regular basis. This can avoid many unnecessary disputes and save a lot of valuable energy to engage in national construction and production work.

However, there are two very basic and urgent issues that need to be resolved before the Minimum Wage Law can be invoked. The first is how to stipulate the bottom line? The second is to what extent is the cost of living index published by the municipal government accurate? These two issues are worth discussing.

### U.S. Gold Price: House of Representatives Plans to Increase, Treasury Department Opposes

[Reuters, New York, 28th] The House Monetary Committee is making another effort to increase the U.S. gold price from $34 to $56 per ounce. However, the U.S. Treasury Department opposes increasing the U.S. gold price, and it is expected that this measure has very little chance of being discussed in the House.

### Tianjin Tea Price

Highest Price 9,600 Yuan Per Jin

[Tianjin News] According to tea merchants, a batch of tea recently arrived in Tianjin from Shanghai and was distributed to various tea shops. Although the price was lower than the local price, it needs to be re-roasted after delivery, which causes damage. Therefore, the selling price has to be slightly increased. The current highest price is 9,600 yuan per jin, while the highest price for black tea is 6,400 yuan per jin.

### Total Amount of Industrial and Commercial Loans Issued by the Four Joint Offices: 1,180,000,000 Yuan

It is reported that the Four Joint Offices have issued loans, with the most loans being granted to export trade and state-owned enterprises, followed by the tea and silk industries, and then the textile and public utilities industries. The total amount reached a huge 1,180,000,000,883,600 yuan, including: export trade 11,428 (unit: million yuan, same below), state-owned enterprises 2,350, silk and tea industries 1,760, textile industry 1,760, public utilities 1,560, mining 800, chemical industry 207, cigarette industry 200, cultural and educational groups 104, and others 213.

### Prospects and Retrospectives of the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang

— Shi Cheng

Among China's agricultural exports, silk, tea, and tung oil have always been the main commodities, with silk being particularly important, producing 100,000 dan annually. Jiangsu and Zhejiang account for half of this, with the rest coming from Guangdong, Sichuan, Shandong, and other regions. They are distributed to countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and the South Seas Islands, and have a good reputation in foreign markets.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many factories were closed. Although some moved to Shanghai to start production, there were very few. Between 1940 and 1941, the enemy's control was very strict. Even if silk was transported from the factory to foreign firms, it had to go through several checkpoints, and it was difficult to collect cocoons. Manufacturers were overwhelmed and closed down one after another, with only two or three remaining.

With the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8, exports were completely interrupted, and only a small amount of capital was used for domestic sales. Silk prices plummeted, and cocoon prices followed suit. The countryside was restless, and many villagers were unwilling to raise silkworms and produce seeds. The price of firewood was also very high, so many mulberry trees were cut down for fuel. To this day, only two or three out of ten mulberry trees remain.

China used to have sericulture farms in Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Huatingguan, among other places, producing high-quality products that could compete with foreign seeds. But now, they have all disappeared. Therefore, the seed production this year is not abundant. Fortunately, General MacArthur has agreed to allocate 300,000 seeds to China.

According to people in the industry, there are about 70,000 dan of silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which can be exported in no time once maritime transportation is open. The plan to revive the industry is to establish the China Silk Company, which will be operated by the state, with Ge Jingzhong as the general manager, responsible for unified sales. There is also a model factory located in Suzhou. The remaining cocoons are entrusted to various factories to be reeled into silk, and the quantity is considerable. Many people are currently planning to open factories, but one of the most difficult problems is the fuel problem. The black market price of coal is high and difficult to buy. The alternatives are diesel and firewood, but buying firewood for a whole day is almost equal to the amount needed for a day of machine operation. Under such difficult circumstances, the future of the silk industry is dim. However, we should strive with perseverance and work hard to bring glory to the country. Fellow silk industry workers, let us encourage each other.

It takes three to five years for mulberry trees to grow from seedlings, and success cannot be seen without careful cultivation. The government should also vigorously promote and encourage it.

The sericulture schools in various places have been almost completely destroyed by the enemy and puppets. In the future, the government should establish sericulture schools in silk-producing areas such as Wuxi, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Haining, and Zhenjiang to train sericulture talents.

Private silk factories lack capital, and the government should subsidize them according to their silk production performance.

In the future, after Italy and Japan successively surrendered, there will be fewer formidable enemies in the foreign market. However, it is reported that agriculture is still allowed to exist in Japan and can be exported in exchange for needed goods. Since silk is an agricultural product, Japan will inevitably revive its old industry and compete with China in the future. Japan is not yet able to export silk, and China should catch up quickly. The future is unlimited.

### How to Make Rubber Caps for Bottle Necks

— Zhong Zuoqi

One of the Small Industries

Under the slogan of "Production First," most domestic people's attention is focused on all heavy and light industries, while ignoring general small industries.

In fact, small industries are quite important. China has suffered damage from eight years of war, and all industrial equipment and decades of painstaking operation have been completely destroyed. The revival of heavy and light industries after the war is certainly necessary, but it is indeed difficult to start anew today, when the domestic economic situation has not yet reached the pre-war level. Therefore, the development of small industries in the future is worthy of attention and cannot be ignored. I hope everyone can shift their attention to the emerging small industries.

Speaking of small industries, everyone knows that there are various kinds, such as ink, shoe polish, toothpaste, and snow cream. These are the most common small industries, and I will not mention them for the time being. What I want to introduce is various other kinds that have a wide sales market but are not noticed by people. Now, let's introduce the manufacturing method of rubber caps for bottle necks.

We often see something like a cup covering the neck of bottles containing medicine or other beverages. This is a rubber cap for the bottle neck. Its function is to prevent the liquid in the bottle from seeping out and to avoid the disadvantage of the internal liquid deteriorating due to air leakage.

The raw materials for making rubber caps for bottle necks are very simple. You only need the following materials to start manufacturing:

20 parts of old film, 90 parts of ether, 115 parts of alcohol, 1 part of castor oil.

First, soak the old film in hot water to soften it, take it out and use a knife to scrape off the upper layer of medicinal film, cut it into small pieces, and put it into the fully mixed ether, alcohol, and castor oil mixture (the amount is matched according to the ratio mentioned above), and stir it to completely dissolve the film into a semi-fluid gel. If you want to color it, add a certain amount of pigment, such as adding half a part of aniline oxide to make it black, adding two parts of aluminum powder to make it silver, or adding two parts of copper powder to make it gold. Then pour the gel into the prepared mold (the mold is made of glass, shaped like a glass cup, the size of the opening is based on the bottle stopper, the largest opening is 60 mm, and the smallest is 15 mm), let it flow evenly to all parts, and blow it with your mouth. The ether will evaporate first, and the gel will gradually harden. While it is not yet completely dry, take it out and put it on the bottle neck. If you use a completely hardened rubber cap, you can slightly dip alcohol or ether around the bottle neck and press it around with your hand. After the alcohol evaporates, a airtight rubber cap for the bottle neck is made. However, two points need to be paid attention to during manufacturing: First, ether evaporates very easily and has a narcotic effect, so it should not be smelled with the nose, otherwise it will cause fainting; second, ether spreads into the air and will burn or cause an explosion when it meets fire, so avoid fire when manufacturing.

The above manufacturing method is relatively simple. In large-scale industrial manufacturing, many places use machines instead of manpower. For example, it is impossible to use your mouth to dry the medicine liquid on the mold, so you should use an electric fan to replace it.

### Issues in Highway Construction

— Ba Ling

Production construction should be linked to transportation construction in order to achieve smooth material transportation and ultimately achieve the goal of economic recovery.

Currently, the call for production construction is very loud, which is naturally a good phenomenon. However, in my opinion, the importance of transportation construction is no less than that of production construction. Among transportation construction, highway construction is indeed an urgent matter.

Only by intensifying production construction on the one hand and promoting highway construction on the other can the materials produced be exchanged smoothly and quickly to all places, and economic recovery can be actively promoted.

### An Introduction to Mutual Commerce Management

— Xu Baiyi

(6) Changes in Purchasing Power

What we are going to discuss now is the reason for the change in purchasing power. Taking the situation in the United States as an example (the situation in China can also be referred to to get an answer), many people know that one dollar can buy less things after World War I than before the war. This is the decline in purchasing power or currency value. We should study the reasons for this decline, because we can know how to look forward to the future and determine the situation in the future. Should we add a factory building or issue company bonds to obtain additional working capital? If we expect that the purchasing power of each dollar will be greater in a few years than it is now, then we should implement a short-term loan. If the purchasing power of each dollar will be lower in a few years than it is now, then it is more cost-effective for us to borrow money and delay repayment.

As for the biggest reason for the decline in the currency system, it can be said that it is due to the increase in the transportation of goods. After the number of bank loans increases, the currency system circulating in the market also increases, so the quantity of goods that each dollar can purchase decreases, and a product that originally only cost ten dollars will rise to one hundred dollars.

When we are running an industrial or commercial business, we sometimes feel that there is insufficient working capital and we need to borrow money from the bank. There are several determining conditions for whether the bank is willing to lend money. The first is to see whether the industrial or commercial business we are running is reliable and how our business policy is. Although the bank can obtain the interest on the loan after lending money, if the industrial or commercial business we are running is not reliable, then there is a risk that the loan cannot be repaid. The second is to see whether the bank itself has a lot of cash. If they do not have a lot of cash, then they cannot lend as much as possible and implement contraction.

Many banks have stipulated the loan limit. They stipulate that a certain percentage of the deposit amount should be used as the loan limit (there are two types of deposits, one is current deposits and the other is time deposits. Time deposits are more suitable for bank lending business because they have a fixed term. Usually, the bank's profit is the difference between the interest charged to the borrowers and the interest paid to the depositors). For example, if a branch receives deposits of 30 million yuan, if they stipulate that 40% should be used for loans, then they can lend 12 million yuan.

In general, the principals of businesses always hope to develop their business quickly, so they constantly borrow money from banks to make up for the lack of their own capital. If they obtain huge loans from the bank, they will add factory buildings and increase production. At that time, it depends on the general situation of the market. If the quantity of goods is overflowing and the supply exceeds the demand, then they will gradually embark on the road of recession. If the quantity of goods is small and the demand exceeds the supply, then the price will rise and the value of the currency system will decline. The prices of goods in recent years have generally been depreciated currency systems, because too many counterfeit coins have been issued, but the prices of goods fluctuate. Any product that is in high demand and has a low supply will rise in price, and any product that is in low demand and has a high supply will not rise in price. Therefore, a management personnel of an industrial or commercial business must grasp their own position and observe the general situation to decide whether they need to expand and manufacture a large number of goods.

In addition to the domestic market, we also need to observe the international market and foreign exchange issues, and pay close attention to the value of the currency system and the value of goods at any time. Regarding the reasons for the change in prices, we can list the following basic situations:

A. The purchasing power of each dollar changes with the following facts:

(1) When the price of goods rises, the purchasing power of each dollar decreases.

(2) When the price of goods falls, the purchasing power of each dollar increases.

B. The rise and fall of prices is affected by the following situations:

(1) The issue of the supply and demand of goods, whether the supply exceeds the demand or the demand exceeds the supply.

(2) The number of currency systems in circulation and their speed of circulation.
