### The Three-Person Meeting Continues to Adjourn Yesterday and Today to Study the CCP's Counter-Proposal on Troop Reorganization. Marshal Ma Held Separate Talks with Yu and Zhou Yesterday.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Three-Person Meeting continued to adjourn for another day today. Given his past experiences, Special Envoy Marshall believes that for major and complex issues, if sufficient preparations are not made beforehand, holding meetings will not only be a waste of time but also affect the emotions of all parties during the meeting, thus missing the fleeting opportunity. However, when Special Envoy Ma issued the notice late last night, he only scheduled a one-day adjournment. Today, due to the US and government representatives needing to conduct a thorough study of the CCP's counter-proposal on troop reorganization submitted today.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] The Military Three-Person Meeting is scheduled to continue its adjournment for another day tomorrow. Zhou Enlai is scheduled to visit Marshall at 11:00 AM tomorrow. It is also reported that the delay in discussing the troop reorganization issue is because the CCP's counter-proposal has not yet been submitted. It is now learned that the CCP's counter-proposal has been drafted and was delivered to Marshall this afternoon.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Zhou Enlai spent from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM this afternoon discussing the troop reorganization issue at Special Envoy Ma's residence. Tonight, Special Envoy Ma will meet with Foreign Minister Yu for discussions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Representatives of the Democratic League Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, and Luo Longji went to Meiyuan New Village at 9:00 PM tonight to listen to a report from Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the CCP Eighth Route Army, on the military situation. At that time, the street lights on Mensheng Street in Meiyuan New Village were dim, and there were few pedestrians. More than ten reporters were waiting under the dim lights for this news, which had not ended by 11:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Representatives of the Third Force held internal discussions at Fengyi Village at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The results of the talks included two points: (1) They believe that the prospects for peace are facing a critical juncture, and they hope for the success of peace and do not want to create unnecessary complications to avoid affecting peace. (2) They hope that the CCP will submit its counter-proposal on troop reorganization as soon as possible so that the troop reorganization meeting can be held quickly. The former of these two points will be conveyed separately by each representative, while the latter will be conveyed by Liang Shuming to Meiyuan New Village tonight. The Third Force will also have another internal discussion tomorrow afternoon.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] According to reliable sources tonight: Regarding the issue of the powers of the U.S. representatives in the Three-Person Group, the Executive Headquarters, and the Executive Sub-Group, intense debates had previously occurred, but an understanding has now been reached. After one of the most difficult issues in the peace negotiations has been resolved, the representatives can concentrate their full efforts on discussing the issue of army reorganization. It is learned that the Communist Party delegation has submitted proposals on the reorganization issue for consideration by the National Government. These proposals were personally delivered by Zhou Enlai to General Marshall at 2:30 PM this afternoon. Zhou Enlai and Special Envoy Ma had a secret discussion for nearly three hours. It is also learned that he will meet with Special Envoy Ma again at 9:00 AM tomorrow. The details of the understanding on the powers of the U.S. representatives in the China peace mediation mechanism are not yet known, but well-informed sources believe that this understanding is largely based on the Communist Party's proposal, that is, the U.S. representatives have the right to submit independent reports, conduct investigations, and implement the decisions of the Three-Person Group. The point that the decisions of the Three-Person Group must be unanimously agreed upon is still maintained.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Xinmin Bao stated today that the KMT and the Communist Party are willing to compromise on the last of the three issues in Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order of June 6, namely the issue of troop reorganization and stationing. The National Government is prepared to concede on the issue of stationing in various areas, and the Communist Party is willing to make concessions on the points of the February 25 agreement, but requests to increase the proportion of Communist troops in the Northeast. The reason is that the "Democratic Allied Army" in the Northeast has a large number of troops. The original agreement between the two sides on the number of troops stationed in the Northeast was three divisions of Communist troops and fifteen divisions of National troops. Now, the Communist Party is requesting to increase two divisions. The Three-Person Military Group "did not hold a meeting today because the opinions of the two sides are still widely divergent."

### Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters, Hopes That Certain Parties Abandon Incitement Policies, Chairman Has Repeatedly Revised the Plan for Troop Reorganization, etc.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Ministry of Information held a reception for foreign reporters at 4:30 PM on the 26th, hosted by Minister Peng and Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The following is a record of the important questions and answers:

(Question) Last week, when the representatives petitioning at Xiaguan Station were beaten at night, several foreign reporters witnessed it on the scene for several hours. The military police did not make efforts to protect them, as if someone had instructed them. Who should be responsible for this matter?

(Minister Peng's Answer) The government expresses deep regret for the Xiaguan brawl incident. Such acts of violence are absolutely unforgivable. The police failed to disband the two sides who were debating and scolding each other at the station for several hours, and failed to stop the brawl in time. Although it is said that the police force in the city is weak and lacks transportation, making it difficult to mobilize quickly, the failure to protect them is undeniable. The government has dismissed the director of the police station in charge and reported to Shen Cheng, the chief of the capital's police department. After the brawl occurred, a large number of military police arrived and dispersed the crowd, rescuing the injured. We sympathize with the injured and are angry with the rioters. However, we cannot help but mention the similar incident that occurred in Shanghai on the same day. When the petitioning representatives left Shanghai, thousands of demonstrators went to the station to see them off. On their way back, they broke into the YMCA dormitory, arrested several anti-communist students, beat them, tore their clothes, and wrote insulting words on their backs with black paint, tying them up for parade. They held a so-called public trial in a nearby park. These students were also rescued by the same late military police at the most dangerous time. This incident happened just a few hours before the Xiaguan incident, casting an ironic light on the peace and human rights guarantees represented by the peace representatives. I sincerely hope that certain parties will abandon such sinister tactics and not incite the lovely youth or involve the elderly who do not know the outside world in the glory of the mass movement to create a propaganda tragedy. We have heard that similar incitements are being actively carried out. We also want to petition the masterminds behind the scenes to at least reconsider this plan from a humanitarian point of view.

(Question) The Ministry of Information claims that the masses are refugees from northern Jiangsu. If this is true, what is the proof? How many rioters have been arrested? What are their names and origins? Are the refugees really as organized as the masses that day?

(Minister Peng's Answer) Tens of thousands of refugees from northern Jiangsu live near Xiaguan Station, so nearby residents can easily identify them. Eight people suspected of rioting have been arrested. Among them, two have been proven innocent and released. Another two, named Cheng Qiong and Chen Xishu, have been proven to have participated in the riot and will be punished according to law. If you have time, you can visit them. A few days before the riot, the refugees from northern Jiangsu were initiating the organization of an association, which was established on the 24th. During the press conference held by the petitioning representatives yesterday, the Refugee Association formally apologized to the petitioning representatives, as you all witnessed.

(Question) To what extent do you hope to reach a final agreement before June 29? It is said that the Chairman has revised his request regarding the Communist Party's withdrawal from certain areas. Can you please explain?

(Minister Peng's Answer) The three points indicated by the Chairman in the order to cease advance, namely, stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganizing the army, must be resolved definitely by the end of the month. The Chairman has repeatedly revised his plan to accommodate the Communist Party's requests. At this stage, details cannot be disclosed yet.

### In Commemoration of Chairman's Great Achievements, Huangshan on the South Bank of Chongqing is Renamed Zhongzheng Mountain

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] Huangshan on the south bank of Chongqing City was the location of Chairman Chiang's official residence when he was in Chongqing. The former Chongqing Provisional Assembly requested the municipal government to rename Huangshan to Zhongzheng Mountain in commemoration of Chairman Chiang's great achievements. The municipal government has recently obtained approval from the Executive Yuan and has officially announced that it will be officially renamed from today.

### Communist Party's Huge Sum of 700 Million Yuan Transported from Peiping to Hankou in Succession

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 25th Dispatch] In June, the Communist Party transported funds from Peiping to Hankou, reaching 700 million yuan. The first batch was 300 million yuan, and the second batch was 400 million yuan. It is reported that the funds have been transferred to the Ninth Group to request the military camp to send special troops to Xuanhuadian.

### National Population Statistics: Over 470 Million

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Ministry of Interior announced today that according to the latest statistics, the total population of the country is approximately 470,026,252, including six million people in Taiwan Province, excluding overseas Chinese.

### US State Department Reaffirms Mission of US Troops in China: Purpose is to Assist Us in Repatriating Japanese Troops

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th Dispatch] A spokesman for the US State Department reaffirmed the mission of US troops in China, which is to assist in the repatriation of Japanese troops in China at the request of the Chinese government. The sole purpose of US troops in China is for this. Previously, according to reports from Nanjing, Mao Zedong requested the United States to immediately stop all military aid to the Chinese government and withdraw US troops stationed in China, hence the above statement was issued.

[Local Dispatch] The scope of work of the US Military Headquarters in China is gradually shrinking, so the number of personnel at the US Military Headquarters is also decreasing. In July of this year, the number will be further reduced. General Mattes, Chief of Staff of the US Military Headquarters, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on July 4. General Gillen, the commander-in-chief, will remain here. The US Air Force Headquarters in Shanghai has now been abolished. Air Force Commander Evans has left Shanghai for the United States a few days ago. The scope of the department has been reduced and changed to the Air Force Department, which is responsible for air traffic affairs, with McReynolds as the commander.

### Kui Yanfang and Others Went to the National Government Yesterday to Meet with Chief Secretary Wu, Stating the Purpose of This Trip. Wu Agreed to Convey to the Chairman Kui's Words That the Reporters Have Gained an Understanding of the CCP's Actions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Shanghai representatives Kui Yanfang and others went to the National Government at 3:00 PM this afternoon to meet with Chief Secretary Wu, stating the purpose of their visit to Nanjing and planning to meet with the Chairman. Wu replied that the Chairman was busy and unable to meet them, but that he would convey the representatives' intentions on his behalf. Kui and others also visited Feng Yuxiang. Kui and his entourage then went to Ninghai Road to visit Special Envoy Marshall.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Since Kui Yanfang and others held a press conference here yesterday, people in Nanjing have gained a very clear understanding of the eight people from Shanghai, including Ma Xulun. They have also expressed positive comments on Kui's frankness. Our reporter visited Kui today to discuss everything. Kui's statement was the same as what he said at yesterday's reception. However, he reiterated that they came here to seek peace, and that the unfortunate incident at Xiaguan was a "misunderstanding." They were determined not to resort to legal means to cause more hardship to the refugees and create more complications, which would deviate from their original intention in coming to Nanjing. Kui finally said that since coming to Nanjing from Shanghai, he has gained a deeper understanding of the CCP's brutal actions from the refugees' complaints heard and witnessed on the way. If he has the opportunity to meet with the CCP representatives in Nanjing, he will directly tell them.

### He Yingqin and Zhang Jia'ao Arrive in Shenyang, There is a Rumor That the Northeast Military Camp Will Be Changed to a Governor's Office Starting Next Month, Chiang Ching-kuo Seeks to Restore Diplomatic Contact

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 26th Dispatch] The transformation of the situation in the Northeast seems to be taking place behind the scenes. He Yingqin flew to Shenyang with Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, this morning and may also go to Changchun. It is rumored that he may return south on the 29th. He Yingqin traveled in great secrecy. Last night, his entourage still claimed that He did not intend to go to the Northeast. This mission may be quite important. There is a rumor that the Northeast Military Camp will be changed to the Chairman's Governor's Office at the beginning of next month, with Xiong Shihui as the director and Du Yuming as the deputy director. Northeast elders such as Wan Fulin and Ma Zhanshan will also have appropriate titles. Chiang Ching-kuo's recent return to the Northeast indicates that the government is seeking ways to restore normal diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast, because since the Soviet army withdrew and the war broke out in the Northeast, Soviet diplomats and some overseas Chinese also withdrew with the army, and normal diplomatic contact was interrupted. In addition, how to restore traffic on the China Changchun Railway and the issue of Dalian's takeover are also issues that Chiang Ching-kuo wants to resolve.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 25th Dispatch] Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Military Camp, flew to Changchun from Shenyang at 3:00 PM on the 25th. According to a statement to the Central News Agency reporter, he left Shenyang at 10:00 AM on the 25th, passed through Siping Street, landed to inspect and meet with Chairman Liu Yaodong, and inspected the badly damaged oil plant, staying for three hours. This is his third visit to Changchun. He will handle the China Changchun Railway affairs and return to Shenyang on the 27th.

The Atmosphere of War in the Northeast is Still Very Strong

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 26th Dispatch] Military Situation in the Northeast: (1) The atmosphere of war in the Northeast is still strong. According to a telegram from Du Yuming to the relevant authorities here, a large number of Communist cavalry are gathered between Wula Street and Yushu on the north bank of the Songhua River, planning to cross the river at the Paozi Ferry, claiming that they will attack Yongji and Jiutai. (2) Official news: The Yanhe Coal Mine between Shenyang and Liaoyang was attacked by more than 200 Communist troops on the 23rd. Two nearby villagers were shot and killed. The Beipiao Coal Mine in Rehe has also been destroyed recently. (3) The Communist army's small-scale transportation sabotage war in the Northeast still occurs from time to time. More than 1,000 Communist guerrillas once invaded Gongzhutun near Xinmin. They were repelled by the National Army on the 23rd and have retreated to Kangping. The Qingjin Dou Station on the branch line from Jinzhou to Xinlitun was also attacked by the Communist army on the night of the 19th. The station was burned down, and nearby power lines and bridges were also damaged. Although the Railway Bureau has repaired and opened the traffic afterward, the Communist army is still active nearby. The threat has not been reduced.

Frequent Troop Movements by the Communist Army in Rehe Province

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 26th Dispatch] Although there were small conflicts on the outskirts of Panyang and Fushun 20 days ago, it is now calm and uneventful. However, the shadow of the god of war has not been completely removed from the area between the White Mountains and Black Water. At the moment, the Communist army in Rehe is constantly increasing its heavy troops from the provinces of Chahar and Liaoning. According to official intelligence, about 5,000 Communist troops from Zhangjiakou Dongkai River and about 30,000 people from Shandong have entered Rehe via roundabout routes. If the peace talks break down eight days later, then these forces may be the new capital for the Communist Party to once again seize the Northeast. The government is also not without preparation. However, under any circumstances, the United States will not give up its belief in and efforts for peace. During the short ceasefire period, US personnel have been working tirelessly in the dust, entering and leaving the line of fire, and have completed some mediation preparatory work. At the moment, the 29th group has set off for Hailong, east of Siping Street, and the 30th group has gone to Haicheng, south of Panyang, to carry out their peace work.

Our Country's Tariff Policy, the Government is Studying Improvements Because All Countries are Adopting Free Trade Policies, We Cannot Use Tariff Barriers to Resist Foreign Goods

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Regarding our country's current tariff policy, many people in the country advocate reconsidering it, because with the import of large quantities of foreign goods, the danger of gradual monopoly in various important markets is increasing, and the future of domestic goods is particularly bleak. This increase in the imbalance in our international balance of payments has a great impact on the national economy. Recently, the financial authorities stated that the import of luxury goods has been strictly prohibited, and unnecessary foreign goods will be taxed heavily. As for our country's current tariff policy, the government is conducting research to improve it. Because all democratic countries are adopting trade policies, in this trend, our country must not adopt tariff barriers to resist the import of foreign goods, but in order to develop our country's industry, appropriate steps will be taken to protect it.

### Chu Minyi's Treason Case Granted Retrial; Prosecutor Files Appeal, Deeming Jiangsu High Court's Ruling Inappropriate

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 26th] Following the Jiangsu High Court's issuance of its Re-Trial Order No. 4 on June 24th, approving the commencement of a retrial in the treason case of Chu Minyi, the Han traitor, the presiding prosecutor Li Shudong voiced his opposition, considering the ruling highly irregular. Specifically, at approximately 6:00 PM on the 26th, he submitted an appeal to the High Court, containing a separate statement of reasons, requesting the reversal of the retrial order. Upon hearing this news, our reporter immediately visited both the president and chief prosecutor of the Court. President Sun stated: "In China's judicial system, the prosecutor's office is independent. As the prosecutor deems this case unsuitable [for retrial] and has filed an appeal, this Court shall, in accordance with the law, consult with the Supreme Court for a final decision." Chief Prosecutor Han stated that decisions made after the third trial cannot be contested, according to the law; the order to retry this case seems to lack a legal basis. Factually speaking, Chu Minyi superficially claimed loyalty to the Father of the Nation, safeguarding documents, but his actions harmed the country's foundation and obstructed the war of resistance. This should not be used as a reason for requesting a retrial. Thus, the prosecutor has filed an appeal, and we will await the final decision of the court of third instance. The text of his appeal is recorded as follows:

Grounds for Appeal

Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Grounds for Appeal. Defendant: Chu Minyi. Regarding the Defendant's treason case, this Court issued a ruling on June 22nd of the 35th year of the Republic of China, ordering a retrial. This prosecutor received notification on the 24th of the same month and believes an appeal should be filed. The reasons are stated as follows: The original ruling granted a retrial based on the retrial petitioner's claim that the Defendant went to Beijing in the 31st year of the Republic of China to negotiate with the Japanese army for the return of the Father of the Nation's remains, which were then re-interred in the mausoleum. He also purportedly exerted effort in Shanghai to retrieve the Father of the Nation's original manuscripts, such as "Sun Wen's Doctrine" and the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," which had been confiscated. The petitioner claimed that detailed records exist at the Nanjing Ninghai Road Detention Center, attesting to his loyalty to the Father of the Nation and the preservation of historical documents, which fall under Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases. The original final judgment did not consider these facts, and according to Article 28, Section 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, there should be grounds for a retrial. However, loyalty to the Father of the Nation lies not in the re-interment of the remains but in the adherence to his will; not in the preservation of his writings but in the implementation of his teachings. The Father of the Nation dedicated forty years to the National Revolution, the goal of which was to achieve freedom and equality for China, and the method of which was to unite with nations that treat us as equals and struggle together. The Father of the Nation's will is clear. Since the Defendant, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, conspired with other traitors to collaborate with the enemy, organize a puppet government, resist our nation, and attempt to plunge our people into eternal damnation. This is a fact confirmed by the Supreme Court's review. His actions clearly violate the Father of the Nation's will, constituting the ultimate disloyalty. His negotiation with the Japanese army for the return of the Father of the Nation's remains and the retrieval of the Father of the Nation's writings, like his organization of a puppet government, infiltration of the Nationalist Party, and the fraudulent use of the Nationalist Government's name, served the same purpose: to deceive the people and confuse the public, in order to undermine the war of resistance and oppose our nation. This is a common trick of treacherous officials and villains, exemplified throughout history. If we had lost the war of resistance, and the nation had fallen, the Father of the Nation's writings, even if preserved, would have been impossible to implement. According to Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, only when a traitor has provided assistance to the war of resistance or engaged in conduct beneficial to the people, with solid evidence, may his sentence be reduced. Furthermore, according to Article 28, Section 2 of the Special Criminal Conditions Litigation Regulations, a request for retrial for the benefit of the convicted person is only valid if important evidence that could affect the judgment was omitted from consideration after the judgment became final, and there is deemed to be a significant error. The regulations are clear. Even if it were true that the Defendant negotiated with the Japanese army for the return of the Father of the Nation's remains and the retrieval of the Father of the Nation's writings, as stated above, his conduct did not assist the war of resistance or benefit the people. Moreover, the Defendant used the name of loyalty to the Father of the Nation to deceive the people and undermine the war of resistance. According to Article 57, Clause 4 of the Criminal Law, regarding his criminal methods, a heavier punishment should be imposed. The original final judgment considered these factors and sentenced the Defendant to the maximum penalty, and there was no significant error. The petitioner's request for retrial is clearly without basis. The original ruling granting approval is difficult to justify. Therefore, within the statutory period, an appeal is filed, and the reasons are stated as above. Li Shudong, Prosecutor, Jiangsu High Court, June 25th, 35th year of the Republic of China.

### Minister Gu and Chairman Wang Arrive in Nanjing to Report on Their Inspection of Northern Jiangsu

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Minister Gu Zhenggang and Chairman Wang Maogong arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 26th via the Shanghai-Nanjing express train after distributing flour to refugees in Zhenjiang that morning. They reported to the central government on the refugee relief work in northern Jiangsu and the inspection of Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Taizhou. They will travel to Xuzhou and Haizhou on the 28th to continue comforting the refugees. Before the Communist army brought disaster to northern Jiangsu, most of the refugees in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Taizhou were landlords, wealthy merchants, public servants, teachers, or honest, simple farmers. Later, due to the Communist army's implementation of the "three-all" policy (kill all, burn all, loot all), the "three resources" policy, the "three-leveling" policy, and bloody "struggles" and purges, they fled en masse and became starving and destitute. Even the original small vendors and poor people fled because they did not want to be driven by the Communist army. Currently, the millions of refugees in northern Jiangsu wander the streets all day long, dying of disease and hunger at any moment. They are very grateful for the government's relief, but their urgent request is that the government protect their return home. Thousands of refugees often follow after Gu and Wang, shouting the slogan, "Please protect us so we can return home!"

### Wang Jingwei's Son, Wang Wenti, Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison, Granted Five Years Probation and Placed Under Supervision

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The case of Wang Wenti, the Han traitor, was pronounced in the Capital High Court on the morning of the 26th. The main text is as follows: "Wang Wenti colluded with the enemy to plot against our country, sentenced to imprisonment for one year and six months, deprived of public rights for five years, all property confiscated except for what is necessary for the livelihood of his family. Wang Wenti is granted five years probation, and during the probation period, he will be placed under supervision." Presiding Judge Zhao Chen explained the reasons. In brief: The defendant was young and inexperienced and followed his father into treason, serving as a junior officer in the puppet government, but he did not take active actions of treason, and his sentence should be reduced by one-half according to law. Furthermore, he mistakenly went astray, and his situation is not without pity, and his sentence should be appropriately reduced. Also, because the defendant has not been given a prison sentence before, he meets the requirements of the probation regulations, so probation is granted. Zhao also stated that during the probation period, the defendant should be placed under supervision and should know to correct his mistakes and start anew, emulating his father's accomplishments in the first half of his life and not dwelling on his father's treason in the second half of his life. After five years, he should be able to graduate from university, and when his probation expires, he can still be a new person who is "has not previously received a prison sentence." Wang Jingwei's son, Wang Wenti, retreated with a "yes, yes," without making any statement. According to the Capital High Court, if there is no retrial, he will be released on bail and handed over to the police station for execution within ten days of the delivery of the judgment.

### Navy Warship Command's Chief of Staff Wei Jinjing Reports for Duty in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, This City] Wei Jimin, Chief of Staff of the Navy Warship Command, set out on the warship Changzhi on the 11th of this month to inspect the defenses of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. While proceeding to Qinhuangdao in the Bohai Bay, he received an urgent recall and returned to his post. On the 24th of this month, he arrived in Shanghai aboard the same warship and reported for duty in Nanjing on the evening of the 26th. The reporter interviewed Wei before his departure, and he provided detailed information. Wei's inspection area extended from Qingdao around the Shandong Peninsula through Yantai, Weihaiwei, the Bohai Bay, and reached Qinhuangdao. According to Wei, along the coast of Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places, defensive fortifications built by the Communist army were visible everywhere. The bunkers and military works in the mountainous areas were also clearly visible. The civilian ships and fishing boats encountered along the way were all escapees from the Communist-controlled areas along the coast, recounting the atrocities of the Communist army, which corresponded to the facts recorded in the current newspapers. According to the boatmen, the Communist army strictly controlled the civilian and fishing boats in the Communist-occupied coastal areas, and they were not allowed to leave their original mooring locations. If a passenger or fishing boat actually left the port, it had to be guaranteed by three households to return to the original location before it could be released. Therefore, the boatmen along the coast under the Communist rule were extremely miserable.

### Editorial: The Attitude of the Chinese People Towards the United States

Yesterday, the United Press reported from Washington that a State Department official stated: "A report from Moscow Radio claiming that the United States and China have a 'secret agreement' to extend the Lend-Lease Act until November 1947 is factually unfounded here." It further stated that this news may be based on a misunderstanding of the clauses of a bill currently under consideration in Congress; this bill will authorize the President to provide China with military assistance and the necessary supplies for its army, to "fulfill the obligations borne by the United States in the United Nations Charter." Congress may authorize the President not only until October 1947, but also for ten years thereafter; at the same time, if Marshall's peace process proceeds smoothly, the Communist army will also receive assistance before formal unification is achieved. As we read this cable, Mao Zedong publicly issued anti-American remarks in Yan'an, stating that U.S. military aid to China is in fact armed intervention, and demanded that the United States immediately cease military aid to China and withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China. At the same time, anti-American slogans have been found in this city, and there have been incidents of U.S. military personnel being surrounded and verbally abused by a small number of people; the occurrence of these incidents is truly unfortunate. Given the occurrence of such anti-American slogans and behavior, in order to express the general intention of the Chinese people, we must expose the truth of this despicable offensive and express our attitude.

First of all, we must declare that these anti-American slogans and behaviors are the work of a small number of scoundrels and cannot represent the general intention of the Chinese people. In the effort to defeat the Japanese invaders, Chinese and American youths fought side by side; the traditional Sino-American friendship, after this baptism of blood, has become increasingly solidified and close. In terms of the spirit of national founding, national character and emotions, and even geographical environment, no two nations can be as close as China and the United States. Although China's War of Resistance Against Japan has been victorious, the great cause of national revolution has still not been completed; to complete our revolution, we need the assistance of a great brotherly country like the United States. The Chinese people are deeply grateful for the various efforts of the United States in China, especially the efforts of Special Envoy Marshall, the five-star general whose reputation is known to all. If the Chinese people have any feelings other than gratitude towards our great neighbor, it is that they feel that the United States' assistance to us seems insufficient, perhaps due to their excessive expectations. Therefore, any anti-American sentiment is definitely not spontaneous among the Chinese people; any anti-American sentiment also definitely cannot represent the sentiment of the general Chinese people.

The Moscow "Red Star" newspaper published an article on the 22nd commenting on the Chinese situation, criticizing U.S. aid to China and launching an anti-American argument. This is not the first time for Soviet newspapers to do so. "Izvestia," "Pravda," and "Red Star," which represents the Red Army's voice, often have anti-American arguments; the anti-American propaganda offensive that has appeared in China is to some extent related to Moscow's anti-American arguments. Why do we say this? The Chinese people have a traditional friendship with the United States, and this friendship has become even more solidified and close because of the war. The Chinese people themselves will definitely not have anti-American sentiment, this can be asserted. The Chinese Communist Party, in order to cover up its crimes and prevent an impartial third party from seeing the various illegal acts it has committed, and also to echo Moscow's sentiments, has launched an anti-American argument and an anti-American propaganda offensive. This is a tactic of the Communist Party, and this tactic, rather than originating in Yan'an, should be said to originate in the Mecca of the Communist International. Looking at it from a more distant perspective, the anti-American propaganda offensive that has appeared in China is not a spontaneous sentiment of the Chinese people, but actually echoes the anti-American offensives that have appeared in other parts of the world, with each being a connected link.

It is in this sense that the Communist Party's actions are actually a betrayal of national interests. We must raise the awareness of our countrymen regarding the Communist Party. Obvious traitors like Chen Gongbo are now being punished by national law; but there are also invisible or inconspicuous traitors among us. Even though the Chinese people's level of knowledge is relatively low, they have the ability to distinguish obvious facts from the past. The Chinese people also have a clear understanding of who is their friend and who is their enemy, and their inner tendencies cannot be concealed.

What we find even more interesting is that the anti-American arguments of the Moscow "Red Star" newspaper and Mao Zedong's anti-American remarks not only echo each other remotely in terms of timing, but their content is also completely consistent. Is this really the voice of the Chinese people? We hope that the Chinese people will use their discerning power and stop being an echo of a third party; those who blindly follow should understand how they are being used by others and delaying national affairs, and should turn back as soon as possible. As for our American friends, we trust that they have the ability and wisdom to discern this disguise. Due to the unfolding of this international anti-American offensive, the people of China and the United States should have a deeper understanding and a closer partnership; the maintenance of world peace is built on this foundation.

### Amidst Territorial Disputes in Southern Yugoslavia, U.S. Warship Arrives in Trieste, Strengthening Forces to Prevent Incidents; Hopes for Success of Four-Foreign Ministers Conference Appear Stronger

[Report from this newspaper] London, 26th – Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's speedy secret talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the Trieste issue have concluded, and the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is on a brighter path. According to sources close to Byrnes, "Byrnes is extremely satisfied with the results of his talks with Molotov in recent days, and believes that the current hopes for the success of the Foreign Ministers Conference are stronger than they were eleven days ago." On the other hand, to prevent any disturbances in Trieste, the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet has made all preparations, and British and American troops are being moved frequently in the Trieste area.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The U.S. Navy Department announced last night that the U.S. 10,000-ton cruiser "Vicksburg" is currently en route from Malta to Trieste. A Navy Department spokesman did not disclose the reason for this move, but it is widely believed that the U.S. warship is heading there to strengthen the forces of British and American warships in the Gulf of Venice. It is reported that this area is currently being contested by Italy and Yugoslavia. According to news from Trieste this morning, there are currently more than ten British and American warships docked in the Gulf of Venice.

### Italian Government Authorities Issue Declaration: Determined to Safeguard Sovereignty; Saragat Elected Chairman of the Constitutional Assembly

[United Press, Rome, 25th] The newly elected Italian Constitutional Assembly held its first meeting today and elected a chairman. Orlando, the only surviving member of the "Big Four" at the Versailles Peace Conference, served as chairman. About 500 members attended. As a result of the vote, former Italian Ambassador to France Saragat of the right-wing Socialist Party was elected with 401 votes against 67 votes. Mr. Saragat is 48 years old and served as a minister without portfolio in the first provisional government, opposing cooperation with the Communist Party. The most noteworthy aspect of today's meeting was the unanimous demand to retain the disputed area of Venezia Giulia. Chairman Orlando declared that no material force or immoral transaction could separate Trieste and other towns in the area from Italy. According to Orlando, the threat to the survival of the nation today is more terrible than at any time in history. The treatment of Italy proposed by the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference is an insult to the tens of thousands of brave soldiers who died in battle, making them slaves to foreigners who still regard us as enemies. If this is the case, a dark shadow will be left on the honor of those who called upon us to fight, lasting for centuries. Prime Minister Gasperi then announced that he had stated at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris that the Italian people could not tolerate this kind of dismemberment. If the peace treaty conditions are too harsh, the United Nations will risk extinguishing the light that the world urgently needs and returning it to darkness.

### Amidst Atomic Bomb Testing, Unmanned Aircraft Show Their Might

4,000-Pound Mysterious Bomb Appears

[Agence France-Presse, from a sightseeing ship near the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb test site, 25th] The Bikini Atoll will be bombed by an atomic bomb on or after July 1st. Around the atoll, there are four observation posts built with steel towers, equipped with calorimeters, loudspeakers, radio measuring devices, and cameras that can take 3,000 pictures per second. Unmanned aircraft will ascend into the air when the atomic bomb explodes, controlled by radio from aircraft with pilots five miles away. Human observers will be no closer than ten miles from the explosion site and will wear lead jackets for protection.

[United Press, from the atomic bomb test viewing ship USS Appalachee, 25th] A newly created 4,000-pound mysterious bomb that was not used on the battlefield will be exposed to the Bikini atomic bomb explosion on July 7th to determine whether atomic heat and explosive force can detonate it.

### Conference on the Use of Atomic Energy Opens in the United States

Economic Power Source, Especially Needed by the Soviet Union

[United Press, Estes Park, Colorado, USA, 25th] The international conference on the management and utilization of atomic energy opened here today. Professor Ryder of the University of Chicago, an expert in international public law, stated that the solution to the international management of atomic energy is more important to the Soviet Union than to the United States, because the Soviet Union has a vast territory but lacks cheap coal. Although the economic use of nuclear energy for power is not yet certain, it is already known that it is more widely used than coal. Areas such as Siberia, where there is no cheap coal supply, may soon prove it to be an extremely valuable source of power. Ryder advocated that atomic energy should be managed by an international committee of the United Nations organization, the nature of this committee being like an international court.

### UN Atomic Energy Commission Establishes Twelve-Member Working Group to Draft International Atomic Energy Plan

[United States Information Service, New York, 25th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today unanimously agreed to establish a twelve-member working group to study all proposals regarding atomic energy control, and then report to the Commission. The working group is scheduled to meet this Friday.

[United Press, New York, 25th] Polish representative Lange announced tonight at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission his support for the Soviet proposal to ban atomic bombs. According to Lange, the Polish government fully supports the proposal made last week by Soviet representative Gromyko, which stipulates the signing of a treaty to immediately prohibit the manufacture, storage, or use of atomic bombs, and to immediately destroy such weapons anywhere in the world. Earlier, French representative Berloty announced that the French government, in principle, supports the U.S. proposal for atomic control and the prohibition of atomic bombs.

Before the Control Plan is Established, the United States Will Never Give Up Secrets

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Soviet Union's desire to have its way on the atomic issue threatens to stall United Nations atomic energy control, and the U.S. Congress is also shaken by this. Some members solemnly declared that the United States will never give up its atomic bomb secrets until an international control method is established. The Soviet plan does not guarantee a layer of international control. The Soviet Communist Party-run Pravda accused the U.S. atomic bomb international control plan as a disguised attempt to seize world hegemony, which has aroused strong rebuttals from the Senate Atomic Energy Committee. Democratic Senator Russell said that the Soviet Union should stop judging others by their own standards. The U.S. plan is generous and willing to give up the inventions obtained with our talents and money. All we ask is to protect the world and ourselves, so that it will not be used for various destructions. I firmly oppose revealing a single piece of information before a control plan is established, and I dare to believe that the majority of members of Congress share this view.

This issue was discussed at the recent Imperial Science Conference. Some people at the meeting also suggested that Britain should cooperate with the United States to establish a standard radio frequency system to meet the needs of the Empire.

[United Press, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian National Congress took emergency steps today to nominate candidates for the Indian Constitutional Assembly. After the British proposal to form a provisional government of fourteen people was rejected, a question has arisen as to what kind of government India will form during the existence of the Constitutional Assembly. Some people expect that the original proposal to form a provisional government will be completely abandoned and discussed separately. Officials may make a formal statement on this within a few weeks. The British had previously declared that regardless of whether India's two major parties individually or jointly refuse to participate in the provisional government, the British will still proceed to form a provisional government that can "fully represent all aspects." At the same time, it is learned that the National Congress has notified the Prime Ministers of the eight provinces to nominate candidates for the Constitutional Assembly. The candidates will be selected from the provincial assemblies in proportion to the number of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs.

Easing the Situation: Three Paths to Follow

[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] The Viceroy met with Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, today to inquire whether the League could consider making concessions to the National Congress's demands at this time when both sides have agreed to long-term recommendations. If the League accepts the provisional plan and makes no further concessions, the three paths that the British Cabinet delegation and the Viceroy can choose are: (1) to organize a temporary administrative council, (2) to reopen negotiations on temporary issues, or (3) to postpone the organization of the administrative council during the election of the Constitutional Assembly.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] Gandhi said in a prayer meeting today that it was not true that the Executive Committee of the National Congress accepted the long-term plan of the British Cabinet delegation despite his opposition. But Gandhi also said that his mind had been very confused for the past four or five days, and he only saw darkness, and he did not know where this fear came from. Therefore, he informed the Executive Committee of the National Congress of this situation and asked them to make their own decisions without considering his opinion. He hoped that the people would follow the decisions of the Executive Committee. He would inform the public when he could see the light again. But during the period when he was surrounded by darkness, he hoped that others would not fall into the same situation as him.

### If the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union Can Cooperate, the Whole World Will Benefit

—Eden's Speech in Canada—

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 25th] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a speech at the Canadian branch of the Association of Parliamentarians of Great Britain here, stating that no major country can engage in war again, nor is it willing to cause new conflicts. Regarding the issue of atomic energy, if an international understanding can be established, many problems can be solved. If the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can finally have a sincere understanding and cooperate with each other, it will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the world. It seems extremely difficult for some countries that have never suffered from aggressors in modern times to fully understand the emotions of victimized countries and their determination to prevent Germany from aggressing again, but we must make them thoroughly understand this situation.

[Reuters, Madrid, 26th] Hoffman, a professor of modern history at Fordham University in the United States, stated in a speech at the University of Salamanca that mutual respect and the maintenance of friendly political relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are important cornerstones for maintaining international peace.

### International Tribunal Continues to Hear Evidence: Japanese Minister of State Kijūrō Shidehara Provides Detailed Testimony on the Inside Story of the Mukden Incident

Truth Revealed About the March Riot Incident in Japan

[Régime Reform Society, Tokyo, 26th] The Far East International Military Tribunal today continued to hear testimony from incumbent Minister of State Kijūrō Shidehara, who was cross-examined by defense attorney Van Nierop. (Q) You mentioned that when the September 18th Incident broke out, Mamoru Shigemitsu and T.V. Soong engaged in negotiations to seek a peaceful resolution. Please elaborate. (A) What the defense attorney has stated is all that I remember. (Q) Why was this effort obstructed? (A) It was likely due to internal disagreements within the Chinese government. There were no issues within the Japanese government at the time. (Q) Is it true that Shigemitsu made the greatest effort to seek understanding between China and Japan? (A) It is true.

After the Incident (Q) After the incident, did the Japanese government receive any reports regarding the movement of Japanese troops in Northeast China? (A) We received reports from the consulate general in "Manchuria." (Q) Were these reports received after the troop movements? (A) We received reports even before the movements. (Q) Even though the Japanese cabinet and Ministry of Foreign Affairs received these reports, they could not suppress the Japanese military? (A) That is correct. Defense attorney Klessmann asked: Did the Privy Council have no control over the military's actions in "Manchuria" either? (A) None. The cabinet could inform the military of the cabinet's attitude through the Minister of War, but the Privy Council did not even have this function. (Q) Is it true, as stated in the indictment, that after November 13, 1931, the Japanese government approved the implementation of aggression in "Manchuria" to expand its territory? (A) After resigning as Foreign Minister, I only knew what was reported in the newspapers. Next, prosecutor Helen questioned: After receiving reports of the Kwantung Army gathering troops and weapons in "Manchuria," what measures did you take? (A) Because the situation was serious, I strongly urged War Minister Minami to take appropriate measures. He also expressed opposition and agreed with my opinion.

Military Rampage (Q) What measures were taken as a result of the conversation with General Minami? (A) As a result, no effect was had on controlling the military. (Q) Did the Northeast Incident occur after the conversation with General Minami? (A) Yes. (Briefly) Which member of the cabinet should be responsible for this military action? (A) I believe the Minister of War should be responsible. On the day the September 18th Incident occurred, the cabinet was unaware of it. At the cabinet meeting that day, the Minister of War promised to investigate and reply. (Q) From whom did the cabinet receive reports regarding the military's actions? (A) The Minister of War. (Q) From whom did the cabinet receive reports when the September 18th Incident occurred? (A) We received a written report from the Minister of War about two days later. (Q) What policy did the cabinet adopt when the incident occurred?

Cabinet Policy (A) We decided on a policy of preventing the recurrence of incidents and not expanding the incident. Based on this, we sent a statement to the League of Nations. (Q) Who participated in deciding on this policy? (A) The entire cabinet. (Q) Based on the cabinet's policy, what actions did the Minister of War take? (A) I believe the Minister of War gave appropriate instructions to not expand the policy. (Q) Did the cabinet order the Minister of War to implement any policies? (A) The cabinet cannot instruct the Minister of War. (Q) Was the cabinet's policy implemented? (A) The incident could not be prevented. I believe General Minami did his best, but the expansion of the incident is a fact. (Q) Who was the commander of the Kwantung Army at that time? (A) I knew from the newspapers that it was General Honjō, but I don't know if General Honjō actually had real power. (Laughter in the courtroom). (Q) Was General Honjō summoned because of the incident? (A) No. (Q) Were any of General Honjō's subordinates disciplined? (A) I don't know. (Q) Who was the ambassador to China at that time? (A) It seems to be Shigemitsu. (Q) Was the Northeast Incident resolved between China and Japan?

Attempted Resolution (A) It was not resolved. Efforts were made between Shigemitsu and T.V. Soong, but they were halted due to disagreements within the Chinese government. (Q) To what extent did the military's actions go? (A) Initially, only along the railway line area, then it expanded to Jilin. By the end of the Wakatsuki cabinet, it had extended to Jinzhou. Next, defense attorney Kiyose cross-examined: If it was neither the cabinet nor the Minister of War who controlled the military, was it the Chief of the General Staff? Regarding major issues, I know that the Chief of the General Staff and the Minister of War consulted, but regarding "using troops in combat," is it not legally under the command of the Chief of the General Staff? (A) As far as I know, regarding the use of troops in combat, the Chief of the General Staff executes it after imperial sanction (approval of the Japanese Emperor), but in fact, he consults with the Minister of War beforehand. (Q) Do you admit that the actions of the army are legally the responsibility of the Chief of the General Staff? (A) I don't know if it is solely the responsibility of the Chief of the General Staff. Because of the consultation, the Minister of War should also share responsibility. At this point, the questioning of Shidehara came to an end.

March Riot Incident

[Régime Reform Society, Tokyo, 26th] After questioning Shidehara, the International Tribunal today proceeded to examine the famous March Plot Riot Incident, the truth of which had never been revealed, and summoned witness Kiyomizu Yukinosuke to testify. Kiyomizu had long been involved with various nationalist groups. In 1919, he returned to Japan from China with Kita Ikki, Iwata Fumi, and others, and joined the Taika-kai. In 1924, he organized the Daikōsha, engaging in Japanese nativist movements. Prosecutor Helen first read out Kiyomizu's confession: "(1) In 1919, I returned to Japan with Kita Ikki and introduced Kita Ikki to Ōkawa Shūmei. (2) Until March 1931, Ōkawa often met with army officers such as Hashimoto Kingorō at the Kinryūtei tavern. According to Ōkawa, these officers aimed to reform the Japanese government and attempted a revolution. I donated 2,000 yen to Ōkawa for this purpose. My task was to throw bombs outside the Diet building when Ōkawa and others held demonstrations. Ōkawa had planned to lead soldiers into the Diet to occupy the government.

Three Hundred Bombs According to Ōkawa, Hashimoto obtained about 300 bombs from the army, which I then stored. (3) Later, Ōkawa said that this plan failed because the army personnel involved in the conspiracy withdrew. Ōkawa also revealed that General Ugaki had participated in the plan. When Ōkawa informed Koiso, the director of the Military Affairs Bureau, that the plan had failed, Koiso replied, "The abandonment of this plan is based on direct orders from the army." Later, at the request of Marquis Tokugawa Yoshichika, the bombs were returned to Colonel Nemoto Hiroshi of the General Staff Headquarters. (4) On a certain day in August 1931, Ōkawa said, "I will initiate some kind of incident in Shenyang with Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku, Military Police Captain Amakasu, and Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Itagaki." (5) After being released from prison in December 1932, I met with Ōkawa several times. Ōkawa was extremely busy organizing the Jinmu Party. The party was an extreme nationalist group that aimed to expel white people from Asia and reform the Japanese government. Around March 1932, Ōkawa said, "I am jointly participating in some kind of conspiracy with young naval officers and Kikkawa Kōzaburō, who hold dissatisfaction with the Japanese government." I said that I would not be able to participate in the plan in the future." After reading this, defense attorney Rix cross-examined: What was the relationship between Koiso and Nemoto? To whom were the bombs returned? (A) At the request of Marquis Tokugawa, I asked Koiso for instructions on how to return them. As a result, the bombs were returned to Lieutenant Colonel Nemoto, who was then the head of the press section. (Q) After the March Incident, were there any other similar plans? (A) I don't remember whether it was the following year or the year after that, but Ōkawa again spoke to me about naval officers and the Ibaraki farmers' group launching some kind of action and ordered me to participate. I opposed it, considering the failure of the March Incident.

May 15th Incident Later, I learned that Ōkawa had participated in the May 15th Incident. (Q) What is the relationship between this matter and this war? (A) There is no relationship. (Q) What did Ōkawa say to you about the outbreak of the Shenyang Incident? (A) Although he didn't tell me a clear opinion, he said while drunk in a tavern, "Although the March Incident failed, something interesting will happen in Shenyang soon." (Q) Did Ōkawa talk about the content of this "interesting event?" (A) Although he did not say it explicitly, I understood it through common sense. (Q) What do you mean by "I understood it through common sense?" (A) It means I understood it implicitly. Next, Kiyomizu answered the questioning from Hayashi Ichirō, the defense attorney for the defendant Hashimoto Kingorō, stating that the goal of the March Incident was to censure the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, which were neglecting the happiness of the people due to partisan politics, and had no aggressive nature. (Q) Is there an article in the Jinmu-kai's platform to expel white people from Asia? (A) No. (Q) In your confession, you said that the Jinmu-kai aimed to expel white people from Asia, which is different from your testimony now. Which is true? (A) That was the general idea of society at the time. (Because Kiyomizu did not give a clear answer, answering evasively, the solemn courtroom was filled with uproarious laughter. Although Hayashi Ichirō repeatedly pressed him, Kiyomizu ultimately did not give a clear answer and had to give up.)

Next, witness Tokugawa Yoshichika was examined, and his confession was read out: "I am familiar with Ōkawa and discussed the issue of advocating the Shōwa Restoration with him.

Expelling White People He mentioned Pan-Asianism and the oppression of Asian nations by white people. In 1931, I discussed a plan with Ōkawa to place militarists in positions of power in the government. In mid-February of that year, Army Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku came and said that he was ordered by Koiso, the director of the Military Affairs Bureau, to ask me to meet with Ōkawa and persuade them to abandon the plan to place the government under the military. Ōkawa acted in accordance with the army's wishes. Several months later, Koiso said that Kiyomizu refused to return the 300 bombs used in the March Incident, so I advised Kiyomizu to return them." Next, the defense attorney cross-examined: Was Major General Koiso the planner of this plan at the time? (A) I don't know the details. (Q) Did you know the performance of the bombs at the time? (A) I only learned later that they were fake bombs that could not kill people. (Q) In the confession, there is a phrase "place militarists in positions of power in the government." Did you often use this expression? (A) I never used the word militarist. (Q) What is the meaning of the word militarist? (A) It means using military force. Ōkawa believed at the time that he could not break through the dark politics of the time without using military force.

### Shanghai Economic Crisis Urgent: Foreign Businesses Jointly Send Letters to the Mayor with Suggestions: High Prices and High Wages Need to Be Resolved Urgently

Representative of British commercial groups in Shanghai, Creswick, representative of Dutch commercial groups, Dolly, representative of Swiss commercial groups, Breretton, representative of Norwegian commercial groups, Hoghough, and representative of French commercial groups, Scoto, recently jointly sent a letter to Mayor Wu Guozhen, along with a attached suggestions, describing the high prices, high wages, and labor disputes caused by labor issues, which have resulted in excessive production costs, declining production, and an urgent economic crisis in the city, with an extremely serious situation. The full text of the suggestions is translated as follows:

Full Text of the Suggestions

(1) We would like to make some suggestions regarding Shanghai's economic problems, especially regarding the high prices, high wages, and disputes caused by labor issues. (2) The cost of living index published by your municipal government has recently increased sharply, reaching 52.02% in May, which is much higher than in previous months. In short, the cost of living index has increased by at least 4,000% compared to 1936. (3) During this period of inflation, exchange rate controls are also being implemented simultaneously. The approved value of US dollar notes has only increased by 593 times compared to the value before 1936. (4) Inflation and exchange rate controls have created an unequal situation in three areas: First, foreigners are encountering problems. We believe that the Chinese are also feeling the consumer losses in both their personal lives and business operations. Second, production costs in the city are too high. Due to competitive prices, it is simply impossible to manufacture products. Third, the excessive manufacturing costs are due to labor and transportation issues, not to mention exports. (5) This situation has been continuing for about six months, and it is a very clear and unchanging deterioration. Therefore, we can assert that if Shanghai's economic situation cannot be improved in the coming weeks, most of the city's enterprises will reduce their business scope or close factories and business premises to maintain the minimum state. This is not what entrepreneurs want to do. (6) As a result, unemployment will greatly increase, and tens of thousands of people will have no work to do and no way to make a living. This crisis cannot be contemplated with equanimity. The mayor has repeatedly explained the dangers of high prices and high wages (making it difficult for most capitalists to pay their employees). If this situation is not improved, the collapse of the economy is imminent. (7) If we do not report these facts to the mayor, we will not only fail ourselves but also fail the municipal government and the labor community. From the standpoint of citizens, we also feel that we should share the responsibility of overcoming difficulties together. To protect the well-being of capitalists, adverse economic conditions should not be allowed to continue to overshadow Shanghai. Presented by: Creswick, representative of British commercial groups; Dolly, representative of Dutch commercial groups; Breretton, representative of Swiss commercial groups; Hoghough, representative of Norwegian commercial groups; Scoto, representative of French commercial groups.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zheng Zhenghua from Xuzhou, residing in Zhangjia Lane, Meilong Town, once served in the enemy's Gendarmerie. He abused his power and harmed innocent people. On the evening of November 16th last year, the township head, Sun Fuxiang, accused Zheng of being a bandit and incited villagers Yu Fubao and three others to break into Zheng's bedroom. They dragged Zheng to the Luo Wang Temple, brutally beat him, and then buried him alive near the Xianren Temple to vent years of accumulated resentment. Later, his wife, Yu Jumei, filed a complaint with the Garrison Headquarters, and Sun and Yu were detained and sent to the District Court. During the trial yesterday morning, the defendants claimed that Yu Jumei had made false accusations because her extortion attempts had failed. After detailed questioning, the court scheduled the sentencing for July 3rd.

### Over 400 Taxis Operating in the City; Jeepney Taxi Rental Under Consideration by Various Taxi Companies

[Our Newspaper's Report] A total of 33 registered taxi companies operate in the city, with 407 vehicles. These include: Xiang Sheng (62), Asia (13), Xin Xin (2), China United Industries (20), An Tai (12), Hu Dong (2), Shun Feng (14), China Communications (9), Tong Li (7), Xin Zha (15), Da Lai (19), Hu Nan (15), Gong Da (13), You Ning (6), Hua Li (3), Dong Hua (24), China (19), Shanghai (7), Central Xinglong (31), Hai Da (10), Da Hua (number of vehicles not yet registered), Fei Yun (29), Zhong Shan (9), Yangzi (number of vehicles not yet registered), Kai Li (18), Dong Fang (4), Yi Tai (number of vehicles not yet registered), Hu Jia (20), Ka De (9), Fuzhou (number of vehicles not yet registered), Lu Bao (10), Xin Sheng (5), and Bai Le (number of vehicles not yet registered).

In reality, the total number of taxis in Shanghai is more than this, as some privately owned vehicles operate under the names of the listed companies, but are not included in the registration. All taxi companies are experiencing booming business because taxis are fast and relatively cheap compared to other means of transportation. Shortly after the war ended, the fare was 1,600 yuan per 20 minutes, later increased to 2,400 yuan, yet customers still crowded the doors, often having to wait in line and even arguing. The vehicles are constantly running, with very few opportunities to return to the company for rest. Recently, due to rising prices, the taxi companies planned to increase the fare to 4,000 yuan, but the Social Affairs Bureau only approved an increase to 3,600 yuan, so negotiations are still ongoing. Currently, a driver's daily wage is about 1.7 yuan, based on the workers' cost of living index. The average employee's monthly salary is around 60 yuan, also based on the workers' cost of living index. At present, there are no new cars or materials being imported from abroad, so the replacement and repair of damaged vehicles is becoming a problem. Recently, the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau proposed to allocate 1,500 Jeepneys to various taxi companies to form a joint venture at a cost of US$1,600 per vehicle. The taxi companies believe that Jeepneys are not suitable for winter and rainy weather and would have to be modified. They are also concerned about business prospects once new cars are imported, and whether they can fulfill the installment payments over two years. These issues are causing concern among those in charge, so the terms and conditions are still under consideration.

[Another Report] According to a person in charge of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau who spoke to our reporter, someone has applied to the Bureau to purchase a large number of Jeepneys from the United States, modify them slightly, and then offer them for public rental. However, the U.S. military has issued an order restricting Jeepneys for military use only, so the Public Utilities Bureau has no authority to approve the application and is currently seeking instructions from the Municipal Government.

### Two Typhoons Brewing; Beijing-Shanghai Area to Be Hit

The second typhoon of the year dissipated after making landfall in Wenzhou, but there were still strong winds in this city. The reporter visited the person in charge of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory of the Central Meteorological Bureau again yesterday. It was stated that the reason for the continuous strong winds in the city is that after the typhoon passed, a high-pressure system rose from the North Pacific to the north of the Yangtze River, while a low-pressure system south of Jiangxi flowed into the Beijing-Shanghai area. The combination of high and low-pressure systems resulted in strong winds. After the typhoon that formed north of Palau Island disappeared, another strong typhoon is brewing in the eastern part of the island. At the same time, there are signs of a typhoon brewing in the South China Sea, but the direction, wind force, and speed are not yet known and may be determined today. It is predicted that the wind force will be stronger than the previous one, and the Beijing-Shanghai area will likely suffer from the impact. The daily reports of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory are included below:

Tropical air currents cover the entire country. The Pacific Ocean remains stable around Japan, Ryukyu, and Torishima. A tropical depression or possible typhoon is northwest of Palau.

Weather forecast: Hazy in the Yellow Sea, brisk easterly winds, moderate to heavy waves.

Central China: Cloudy, locally overcast, with thunderstorms, moderate variable winds, fog in the morning. Shanghai: Overcast, sometimes cloudy and hot, haze and fog in the morning, gentle southerly winds. East China Sea: Cloudy, brisk easterly to southerly winds, moderate to locally heavy waves.

Temperature on the 26th: Highest 91.1 degrees, lowest 79.2 degrees.

### Many Good News; Don't Sigh About Not Being Able to Get a Ride; Public Utilities Bureau Is Constantly Working Hard; Public Buses Will Greatly Increase

[Our Newspaper's Report] Four red temporary public buses have been officially added to the existing Route 3 since the 21st of this month. These vehicles were purchased from Xiang Sheng Motor Company. It is also understood that the French Public Bus Company will soon have 20 new public buses available, which can be shipped from France in mid-October. The Public Utilities Bureau will establish fixed parking lots at appropriate locations.

[Another Report] At the end of last week, the Public Bus Planning Committee of the Public Utilities Bureau added four new red buses purchased from the United States to Route 3, which has been convenient for passengers since they started operating. It is reported that the Committee has recently purchased 20 public buses from the Supply Bureau, which are being refitted and will all be completed by the beginning of next month. It has not yet been determined whether to add them to existing routes or open new routes, and a decision will be submitted for a vote at a meeting next Tuesday. During this hot summer, for the convenience of passengers traveling early in the morning and late at night, every night from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM at Beijing Road Bund and from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM at Lao Bei Men, each passenger only needs to pay 150 yuan in legal tender to travel directly to the factory site at 150 Gongping Road, Broadway Road. The same price applies when the buses leave the factory every morning from 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM. However, the buses will go straight in and out during these times and will not stop along the way. In addition, in order to assist passengers in adopting opinions, passengers who are dissatisfied or have suggestions for improvement can submit them in writing and send them to the Transportation Section at 150 Tanggu Road. Those who submit must state their name and address.

### Shao Shuhua, Deputy Manager of the Pseudo Central Reserve Bank, Sentenced to Ten Years; Lu Xihou and Others Found to Have Improper Jurisdiction

The main text of the judgment: "Shao Shuhua, colluding with the enemy to plot against the country, is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for ten years, and all property, except for necessary living expenses for the family, is confiscated."

### Anti-Smuggling Work on the River Still Feels Weak

[Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter met with Wu Kexiao, the director of the Municipal Water Police Branch, yesterday to discuss the recent work and anti-smuggling situation of the branch. According to him, the branch is authorized to have 600 police officers, but in order to improve the quality, they must pass a secondary school level exam and then undergo training. Therefore, there are currently only over 200 qualified police officers working. The branch has three sub-stations and eleven police stations along the Huangpu River. There are currently seven patrol boats, all of which are old and dilapidated, and three of them are damaged and still under repair, which affects the work. Of the remaining four, each sub-station is assigned one, and the branch has only one left. They patrol the river all day, alternating shifts, and work all night. As for anti-smuggling, it is only to assist the customs police. Recently, a large number of untaxed American cigarettes and candies have been seized and handed over to the customs. Wu also said that the environment in Shanghai is complex, with a century of concessions and eight years of enemy rule, coupled with the influence of gang forces, it will not be easy to completely eradicate the evil forces along the river and wharves in one day.

### Pseudo Deputy Minister of Propaganda, Zhang Ke, Defends Himself Like a Lecture; Pseudo President of the Supreme Court, Zhang Tao, Tried, Swaggering, Gold Teeth Gleaming, Rude Tone

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Ke, the former deputy minister of the propaganda department of the puppet regime, is a 43-year-old from Hangzhou. He graduated from Columbia University in his early years, and later studied politics at the University of Berlin. After returning to China, he served as the personal secretary of Chen Youren. After the fall of Hong Kong, he was captured and lived in Shanghai for a long time. Later, at the invitation of Lin Bosheng, he took the position of deputy minister of propaganda for four months and ten days. After resigning, he published the "Dagong" weekly. He was previously mentioned by the High Court, and the trial concluded yesterday afternoon. The defendant spent a long time defending himself against the indictment, with ups and downs in his voice, resembling a loud lecture. His content can be divided into two points: (1) During his tenure as the deputy minister of propaganda, he never published or gave speeches promoting peace or publicizing the puppet regime; (2) In the "Dagong" weekly he published, he tried his best to carry out the tasks he could not carry out during his tenure in the puppet regime, and engaged in criticizing the puppet government and publicizing the war of resistance. He then listed the texts from various issues of "Dagong" as evidence. The court also asked about his experience in joining the puppet regime, to which he replied: "Lin Bosheng came to me and said, Wang Jingwei's illness is beyond salvation. What will happen after his death? I said that the only thing to do is to dissolve the puppet organization and convene a meeting of popular representatives to decide. Then I discussed it with Chen Gongbo and decided to take the position of deputy minister of propaganda to carry out this task. Zeng Qi and Ji Sihao were also present during the discussion, and they also knew about this. It was definitely not me who insulted him." During his speech, his voice became hoarse and he forgot where he was, and was stopped by the judge. After lawyer Hong Shihao provided free legal defense, the court ordered the end of the debate, and the sentencing was scheduled for 2:30 PM on July 2nd.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Tao, a 61-year-old from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, is a member of the Kuomintang. Starting from the seventh year of the Republic of China, he worked as a lawyer in Hangzhou and Shanghai for nine years. He also served as a judge in the Beiping Dali Court and as a presiding judge in various levels of courts in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he suddenly changed his allegiance. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, Wen Zongyao, Liang Hongzhi, and others organized the "Reformed Government" in Shanghai to resist the Central Government. Zhang served as a pseudo "Legislative Committee Member" and "Chairman of the Economic Committee". In March of the 29th year, when Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others organized the Nanjing puppet National Government and established a rebel regime, he was transferred to the post of the president of the pseudo Supreme Court until the collapse of the enemy puppet regime, when he was arrested and brought to justice. When the High Court opened the trial yesterday morning, Zhang was wearing a gray silk long gown, with a self-woven silk short shirt and trousers underneath, gray socks, and black shoes. He had old-fashioned glasses on his nose and was holding a bamboo fan. He swaggered and leaned on the defendant's fence with both hands. When answering questions, Zhang opened his mouth and revealed two gold teeth, constantly saying disrespectful phrases such as "Yes, oh"? "The court understands, oh"? The fan in his hand also started to dance, but it was taken away by the bailiff, and he lost a tool to help him express himself. According to Zhang, he and Chen Zemin were classmates and graduated during the late Qing Dynasty. Later, he served in the legal field. He joined the Kuomintang in the 13th year of the Republic of China. When party member registration was held in the 17th year, he was discarded because he was a member of the Western Hills faction, so he tore up his party card. Although he later joined the party again, he did not receive a party card. During his tenure as the chairman of the pseudo Economic Committee, the Japanese side requested that the ten major companies such as railways, telecommunications, and water and electricity be operated by Japanese merchants, but they were all rejected, which shows that he never acted against the country. As for the "Supreme Court" matter, he said that it was just judicial work and did not harm the country. He was dismissed from the court at around eleven o'clock, and a retrial was scheduled for a later date.

### Qian Yongming Discusses the Monetary System, Says Monetary Reform Is Not Yet the Time

[Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter recently visited Qian Yongming, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications, and asked for his opinion on the current economic and financial situation in the country. He said that the turning point of the current domestic economy and finance is still related to the solution of the entire political problem. Because the political problem has not been resolved, national transportation cannot be smooth, and the economic and financial communication in various places is cut off. Tax revenue cannot be restored, so the national finance cannot be balanced, and a deficit budget will appear. As for the talk of reforming the monetary system, Qian believes that it seems impossible at present. Moreover, the monetary reform plan should be able to solve the problem once and for all, and it cannot be done again and again. Therefore, the talk of reform at present is not yet the time. Qian believes that the central bank's foreign exchange and gold policies are appropriate. However, he hopes that the central bank should pay more attention to the internal exchange problem of our country. Qian expressed optimism about the financial prospects of this city. He said that Chairman Chiang has worked hard for the political situation, and Special Envoy Marshall has worked tirelessly to mediate, so he hopes that all parties in the country can be tolerant and united. He also hopes that those who often criticize the authorities' policies should actively participate in cooperation, express their opinions, and not just engage in empty criticism, which is of no practical benefit.

### People's Freedom Protection Association Investigates the Case of Students Being Beaten

The case of patriotic students being beaten that occurred in this city a few days ago has been given great attention by all sectors of society. After the Shanghai Student Anti-Civil War League appealed to the People's Freedom Protection Association of this city, it has sent personnel to investigate and has submitted opinions to the Municipal Government and the court, advocating that the case be handled strictly.

### 53 Organizations Supposedly Sending Representatives to Beijing Is Groundless

According to reports, Ma Xulun and others held a tea party for reporters in Nanjing on the 25th of this month, claiming that 53 units of Shanghai people's organizations, such as the "Shanghai Third District Textile Industry Industrial Union," had elected representatives to go to Beijing to petition. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with the Social Affairs Bureau, which is in charge of people's organizations. It was stated that the cotton spinning and cotton weaving industries in Shanghai have always been organized separately, and there is no such organization as the Third District Textile Industry Industrial Union. The original Third District Cotton Spinning Industry Labor Union and the Third District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union have also been reorganized into factory labor unions and have submitted their seals for cancellation. The 53 organizations claimed by Gui Yanfang and others have been investigated and found to be organizations that have not been approved according to law, and are obviously stealing public opinion under false pretenses. In addition, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's Ninth General Assembly of Members, the Shanghai Industry's Anti-Civil War League, and the Shanghai Student Federation have all issued declarations denying that Gui Yanfang and others are representatives of all sectors of Shanghai. It can be seen that these self-proclaimed representatives have no real basis, and the so-called "53 organizations" are undoubtedly forged.

### Visiting the Shelters, Refugees Compete to Complain

[Our Newspaper's Report] The number of refugees fleeing from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai is increasing day by day, and the relief problem is urgent. The reporter visited the shelter set up on the upper floor of the Dongjiaxing Road small vegetable market yesterday. The refugees surrounded and complained. According to them, although the shelter once received relief flour, there was not enough to distribute to everyone. Now they only have a bowl of thin porridge a day. How can they survive on that? Therefore, many refugees go out during the day to earn a living on their own, pulling rickshaws, working as coolies, or even begging to make a living. Although many of them are ordinary farmers, there are also many who were "struggled" into poverty. Now that they have drifted to Shanghai, it is not easy to find hard labor, so they urgently hope that the outside world can provide more relief. The shelter currently houses more than 200 people living together, and the sanitation problem is worrying.

### A Fugitive in Jiangyin County Commits Suicide After Being Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Peilin, a fugitive from Jiangyin County, mixed into Shanghai.

Yesterday morning, Wang was arrested at a certain location and taken to room 232 of the Da Shangmei Hotel for a temporary rest. Unexpectedly, Wang Peilin took advantage of the unpreparedness of others to jump from the building and commit suicide. He fell and injured vital parts and was sent to Renji Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died more than two hours later.

### Plans to Add New Ferry Lines in the City, Bridge and Tunnel Difficult to Realize Temporarily

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Shanghai Ferry was taken over by the Public Utilities Bureau, it is planned to add the Tang-Dong Line and Qing-Ding Line this year and add three small vessels. Starting next year, it is planned to add the Nan-Hang Line to connect with the Shang-Nan Railway. Another one or two cross-river ferry lines will be opened, and the locations are being surveyed, possibly at the Bund of Beijing Road and the Huishan Wharf. The Bureau also plans to purchase two 200-ton vehicle-carrying vessels, each capable of carrying ten 21-foot trucks or twenty ordinary passenger cars, and can carry 450 passengers. After research, it is most suitable to operate on the line from Dongmen Road in Nanshi to Dongchang Road. As for the plan to build the Pujiang Bridge and tunnel, it is difficult to realize temporarily due to the excessive cost.

### Yuan Meiyun Imprisoned for Drug Use; Wang Yin Submits a Petition to Exempt Her from Execution

It was previously reported that her husband, Wang Yin, did not care about her at all and never visited or comforted her. This news is indeed true, but not entirely so. Wang Yin has submitted a petition to the District Court to request that Yuan be exempted from serving her sentence! According to the reporter's investigation: Yuan's defense lawyer, Meng Gang, also submitted a petition to the District Procuratorate yesterday, making the same request. The application from Wang Yin was submitted to the District Procuratorate at the same time for review by the prosecutor in charge of the case, and a decision may be made soon.

The number of members is still increasing. The association has raised more than 60 million yuan in funds, and the interest is used as funding for the welfare of members. As of recently, after investigation and verification by the association, those who died in the line of duty and have direct relatives who apply will be given a pension of 200,000 yuan per person. More than 60 people have been issued. The regular relief expenses for comrades who suffered have reached hundreds of people. The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has successively allocated 930 bags of flour to the association, which have been secretly distributed to the families of martyrs and poor members. The association will continue to strive to promote the welfare of comrades who suffered, but the biggest difficulty is the education problem of the children of martyrs and comrades who suffered. After several requests from the association, the Education Ministry's Loan Committee has agreed to subsidize tuition and fees for 50 students in private schools. However, most of the children of comrades who suffered still face the crisis of dropping out of school. It is heard that the military tribunal in Tokyo trying Japanese war criminals and the military tribunal in our country trying Japanese war criminals have successively sent documents requesting the association to provide evidence of Japanese war crimes. The association is now actively engaged in collecting evidence.

### Pudong Embankment Project to Be Completed by the End of the Month

### Spurned Advances Lead to Acid Attack

[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Shizhong, a resident of Liuliqiao in Pudong, had been lusting after his cousin Chen Xiubao (25 years old, from the South Pier) for some time because she was quite attractive. He repeatedly harassed her, but was always rejected. At the beginning of March of this year, Shizhong insisted on inviting her to play in Shanghai. Not only did Xiubao refuse, but she also slapped Shizhong twice in the face. Shizhong, unable to achieve his goal, held a grudge. On the night of the previous day, while Xiubao was alone at home, Shizhong entered the house and poured a bottle of nitric acid on Xiubao, and her head, face, chest, abdomen, and other parts were immediately torn apart. She cried out loudly for help, and Shizhong fled without a trace. Afterwards, her brother reported the incident to the Liuliqiao Police Station and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the rescue was prompt, and there was no danger to her life.

[Our Nanjing Special Correspondent] At the beginning of the Victory, Chairman Jiang had a telegram instructing the Ministry of Education: "The status of the fishing industry is important after the war, and it is also of great importance to people's livelihoods. The training of aquatic talents should be planned as early as possible. Existing aquatic schools with a foundation should be restored. I hope you will earnestly handle this matter."

### Charity Football Match Grand and Enthusiastic, Qingbai Wins Again Against Xingdong Team

Result: Qingbai Team Reverses Defeat with a Score of 2-1, Second Auction of Charity Ball Raises 10 Million Yuan

The grand charity football match to raise funds to relieve disaster victims in central Hunan and northern Jiangsu, Xingdong vs. Qingbai again, was held at Yiyuan at 5:30 PM yesterday. As a result, Xingdong lost to Qingbai again with a score of 1-2. Two minutes before halftime, Xingdong scored a penalty kick against Qingbai, taking the lead with a score of 1-0. However, two minutes after the start of the second half, Qingbai also scored a penalty kick, and Cao Qiuting scored again, allowing Qingbai to reverse the defeat with these two goals. The performance of both sides was quite wonderful, which was the first time seen in Xingdong's seven matches in Shanghai. Yesterday, the initiators Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shizhao, Fan Shaozeng, and Gu Jiatang were all present to preside over the match, and former Mayor Qian Dajun also attended to watch the match. During halftime, the charity ball was auctioned off, and Ms. Wang Yunmei purchased it for 5 million yuan. Ms. Wang then continued to donate the purchased ball for charity auction, and Du Weifan, on behalf of Hengshe, also purchased it for 5 million yuan. Their enthusiasm for disaster relief is admirable. Next, the award ceremony was held, and Zhang Shizhao presented each of the Qingbai and Xingdong team captains with a silver cup. The grand charity match was declared closed.

Orderly

Yesterday, approximately 10,000 spectators came, all for the sake of disaster relief. Military police were dispatched yesterday, and in addition to setting up posts at important intersections, there were also several lines of barbed wire to maintain order. However, disorderly fans lingered around the outside of the stadium until a quarter of an hour before the end, and a portion of the spectators still broke through the fence and entered. Fortunately, the game ended soon after. The lineups of the two teams yesterday were as follows:

Qingbai

Huang Shijie

Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang

Qu Yongfu Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng

Cao Qiuting Luo Choufu up Xu Deming down Xu Wenkui Gu Yiche Fei Chunhua

Opening Ceremony Held

The game began with the national anthem. Referee Zhang Le and Du Yuesheng stepped onto the field to hold the opening ceremony, kicking the ball. The two armies came into contact, and Zhang Jinhai intercepted the ball and ordered an attack. Meng Yiliang sat firmly in the central hub, blocking the way. After five minutes, Fei Chunhua went deep alone, and Huo Yaohua was unable to catch up in time. Xiao Fei tried his foot, but unfortunately, it was deviated and missed. Not long after, Luo Weizhao launched an uprising in the middle road, trying a shot from 30 yards, but it went high over the goal. In less than a minute, Meng Yiliang mistakenly fouled Wang on the left foot, and Xu Jingcheng took the free kick from 30 yards. The ball was urgent, but it was still slightly deviated and went wild again. At ten minutes, Baozheng passed to the right corner, and Chunhua advanced along the side. When he got to a good position, he raised his foot and shot hard, but it was embraced by Zhu Zhaoheng. The situation was average, with each side having offensive and defensive plays.

Xingdong

Zhu Zhaoheng

Huo Yaohua Hou Rongsheng

Luo Wei Xu Jingcheng Feng Kunsheng

Li Shuoyou Li Zhaorong Liu Songsheng Guo Yingqi Zhang Jinhai Feng Jingxiang

Penalty Kick

The atmosphere at the stadium was extremely tense. The melee continued until two minutes before the end of the half, when Zhaorong opened a corner kick. Jinhai knocked on the door, Baozheng headed to save the day, and Meng Yiliang touched the ball with his hand, violating the rules. Zhaorong took the penalty kick, and the ball went into the net from the right corner. 1-0, Xingdong took the lead in the first half.

Donated One Ball

After the charity ball was auctioned and the awards were given, the two formations were rearranged. The Xingdong team faced the challenge with the original lineup, and Qingbai took a short break, with Xu Deming substituting and entering the field. After the start of the game, the Qingbai forwards attacked relentlessly. At two minutes, Qingbai received relief from Yiliang and was about to cross. Jihua fouled, a penalty kick in the penalty area. Xu Wenkui took the penalty kick and broke through the Xingdong net in the upper left corner. 1-1, creating a tie. Two minutes before one penalty kick, and two minutes later, it was also a penalty kick. It can be said that it was a fair distribution of colors and a return of courtesy.

Qiuting Hits Miraculously

Qingbai scored, and the morale was greatly boosted. At nine minutes, Xiao Fei went alone, rushing straight in. A small pass to the left corner, Cao Qiuting arrived in time, and at about ten yards, he broke through the enemy's fortress again. 2-1, Qingbai reversed the defeat and won. After fifteen minutes, Baozheng went to the ground to save the ball and fouled again. Zhaorong took the penalty kick but did not score. At this time, Yaohua withdrew, Shuoyou entered to supplement the left wing, Songsheng moved to the midfielder, Luo Weiquan lived in the center, and Xu Jingcheng retired as the left back. After this adjustment, Xingdong took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, but it was still in vain. Two minutes before the end, Wu Qixiang was violently hit by Luo Weiquan and left the field with serious injuries. Before long, the time was up. 2-1, Qingbai won against Xingdong again.

According to the newspaper, which was the first championship game broadcast by television, the number of people watching and listening to the game on television screens was more than those packed into Yankee Stadium, the venue of the game.

Some visited the RCA laboratory in Princeton, where no less than 3,000 boxing fans gathered to watch the boxing match. It is remembered that boxing match broadcasts began 25 years ago, when Jack Dempsey and Karpentia held a championship match in Jersey City. Since then, radio has made some progress, and last week's television broadcast was the latest development in this regard.

### First Review Completed: Import Application Instructions

Next Application Has a Fixed Period; Do Not Order in Advance Before Approval

[This Newspaper Report] It is reported that since the Import Goods Management Office began handling the import license applications for five categories of goods, namely automobiles, tobacco leaves, sugar, films, and kerosene, it has been stipulated that they be processed in batches every quarter (three months). However, the import license applications for the period from March 1st to September 30th of this year will be processed in one batch. The application matters for this period ended at the end of last month. After assessment by several experts at the office, the import quotas for the above five categories of goods within this period have been fully determined yesterday and have been separately notified to the applying importers by the office. It is also learned that for items to be imported each quarter thereafter, applications should be submitted to the office before the end of the second month of the previous quarter. The office may reject or reduce the amount requested in the application. Therefore, applicants should not place orders in advance before the approved amount is confirmed. Furthermore, items permitted to be imported each quarter should be imported before the end of the following quarter; otherwise, the original applicant may not be approved for subsequent applications. However, exceptions will be made for special reasons, provided that concrete evidence is presented. This method applies equally to all importers, both Chinese and foreign. (Chang)

Gold Price Without Special Fluctuations, Hong Kong Dollars More Popular Than US Dollars

Yesterday, the price of gold remained stable. The central government's allocated price was slightly increased to 1.95 million, with 245 bars allocated. People's confidence grew stronger, like rising water. The opening price in the morning already showed a slight increase. After the opening, in view of the currency system reform, a slight hint of change emerged, and buyers were still eager, pushing the price up to 1.965 million before some long positions were sold off. In addition, due to the relationship between the central registration allocation and the allocation price, buyers were slightly more cautious. However, the trading volume was limited, and there was no significant change. At noon, the price slightly decreased to 1.94 million, but in the afternoon, it rallied again to around 1.965 million. As a result, the closing price was 15,000 higher than the previous day. The price of gold ornaments was 10,008, and the price of silver remained unchanged. Interest rates ranged from 13 to 16 cents.

The foreign exchange market remained difficult for US dollars to rally. The opening price in the morning was flat. The opening price in the morning was flat. The price briefly rose to 2,680 yuan in the middle of the day, but only temporarily. As the gold price slightly declined, it hovered around 2,650 yuan at noon. The price slightly rose in the afternoon, but the increase was not as strong as gold. As a result, the closing price was only slightly higher by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars remained popular, rising from 515 yuan to over 530 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose by another 12 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose from 520 yuan to around 535 yuan. Indian exchange rates also rose to around 650. The British exchange rate was between 8,500 and 8,000 yuan. Trading was still more active in Hong Kong dollars, while US dollars were ostensibly stable but secretly sluggish.

### Public Bond Transactions Sparse

Public bond transactions remained sparse, with long and short positions fighting each other, creating a seesaw situation. In fact, the quoted prices were far from reality. Short sellers did not want to linger too long and hastily covered their positions to take profits. Although there were various naive and superficial so-called resolutions, the organization was loose, and knowledgeable professionals did not take it seriously, so most remained on the sidelines. Currently, most over-the-counter transactions are small-scale. The highest price for Type C bonds was 850 yuan, the lowest was 770 yuan, and the final price hovered around the previous day's price. Miscellaneous brands continued to be quoted higher. As a result, Type C bonds were flat and weak, while miscellaneous brands were more stable.

### Yarn and Cloth Stable

Yesterday, the yarn market became more stable. The Hua Nan gang (Southern China traders) reappeared, and Double Horse yarn rose again to 1.55 million. The market closed with strong sales of 60,000 pieces, while the prices of other 20-count small and medium-sized yarns were mediocre, with few transactions. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened its yarn sales as usual. Blue Phoenix yarn was offered for sale in the 20-count category, with a price 30,000 yuan higher than the Feng Nian brand in the previous period. The quoted prices for other counts and thicknesses of yarn were similar to the previous period.

The momentum of serge and grey cloth remained strong. This was because customer sales were still maintaining, so confidence was good. Serge rose by 1,000 yuan due to a shortage of spot goods on the market. Fine cloth was also in demand from dyeing factories and customer groups, so it also rose by 500 yuan. There were no other significant changes.

### Sugar Market Strong

Yesterday, the sugar market was strong due to the continued shortage of spot goods. The association's price list showed that spot medium white sugar was initially 110,000 to 111,000 yuan, then 108,000 to 110,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan. Road cargo was 108,000 to 8,500 yuan, then still 8,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were relatively firm, 112,000 to 1,000 yuan, then 110,000 to 109,000 yuan. The closing price was 110,000 yuan. The white sugar for the fourth and a half truckloads was marked at 168,000 yuan. In addition, a batch of enemy property sugar was auctioned for the 32nd time, totaling 120 to 136 bags of 180 dan and 750 packages, all at 86,000 yuan. Medium sugar was 937 packages, at 98,000 yuan. Rock sugar was 347 packages, at 162,500 yuan. White sugar for three and a half truckloads was 104 packages, at 168,000 yuan, and another 25 packages, at 145,000 yuan. Unrefined sugar was 55 packages, at 82,000 yuan. It was verified that the amount of medium white sugar requested by the commercial firms from the Taiwan Company the day before was more than 30,000 packages, and it was decided yesterday to supply the full amount, of which spot goods accounted for 25 percent and road cargo accounted for 75 percent. Raw sugar was also quoted at 86,000 yuan. Numbered goods were quoted with 30 packages of green sugar, at 95,000 yuan, 60 baskets of Number 3 ice, at 122,000 to 5,000 yuan, dozens of baskets of Xinghua red sugar, at 100,500, and Xinghua white sugar, at 126,000 yuan, followed by 120,000 to 118,000 yuan.

### Increased Grain Arrivals, Market Trends Stable

Yesterday, the number of grain cargo registrations in the rice market increased to a total of 2,506 shi (unit of volume), an increase of 1,242 shi compared to the previous market day, including 20 shi of "埠尖" (high-quality rice), 114 shi of "蕪秈" (Wuhu indica rice), 2,372 shi of milled indica rice, and 452 shi of rice transported and sold by rice shops themselves. Therefore, the general trend remained as stable as usual. (Yesterday's reports of declining prices for Baiyuan and Yinyuan (silver dollar) rice were erroneous reports from the rice market; the actual market prices did not change.) The situation for flour remained stable, with a slight increase of 200 to 300 yuan. Bran remained temporarily flat. Oil prices were firm in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, with prices hovering around the same levels. High-quality soybeans remained stable, while medium- and low-quality soybeans were sluggish, with prices falling by 500 to 600 yuan. Broad beans were stable, similar to tea beans. Sesame also saw little change. Soybean cakes from Shantou were not popular and sales in the countryside were sluggish, resulting in a stable market situation. Small wheat from Zhoushan, Ningbo, and Shantou was not sought after, leading to a softening market.

### Speculative Ingenuity, Bulls Take Profits at High Levels, Stock Market Rallies Again

Yesterday, the Hua stock market suddenly rallied. Outside speculative funds, seeing the heat, joined in. Long position companies in Yong Yarn took the opportunity to take profits after the rise. Retail investors and new long positions were shaken again. Yesterday, the market retreated, but one or two unpopular small stocks showed their own activity and suddenly shone. Sino-French reached a high price of 217 yuan with trading. High prices were forced down slightly by the general trend, but the underlying momentum remained strong. The highest prices in the morning were Yong Yarn at 560 yuan, Mei Ya at 3,600 yuan, Jing Fu at 255 yuan, Xin Guang at 277 yuan, and Qin Xing at 220 yuan. The lowest prices at noon were Yong Yarn at 518 yuan, Mei Yuan at 3,200 yuan, Jing Fu at 218 yuan, Xin Guang at 230 yuan, and Qin Xing at 170 yuan. Afterwards, the prices leveled off slightly. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks also stabilized before slightly falling. As a result, the closing prices were half a percentage point lower for Yong Yarn and Mei Ya, and around one percentage point lower for Jing Fu and Xin Guang. Qin Xing was 1.5 percentage points lower. Among unpopular small and medium-sized stocks, except for Xin He, which had to bear half of the subscription shares due to the bonus shares, the decline reached one percentage point. The declines in the rest were very slight.

Some securities firms in the foreign stock industry, in view of the impending customs closure, reduced their holdings and became weaker. Yi Yarn retreated to 9,700 yuan upon opening in the morning, and Mei Lian to 8,400 yuan. After the opening, they continued to decline. After weakening at noon, they recovered slightly. As a result, Ying Lian, Yi Yarn, Paper Industry, and Asia each fell by about 10%. Yi and Wheelock Steel fell by about half a percentage point, while Ye Guang fell slightly but still little.

### Real Estate Industry Stagnant, Timber Stockpiles High

Taiwanese Tiles Also Arrive. Since the victory, widespread construction has not shown any development. For eight years, timber that has been stockpiled in the mountains for a long time has been hoped to meet the needs of construction after the victory. Unexpectedly, the opposite has happened today. Although the timber has been transported to the cities, there is no way to sell it, and the price of the goods is falling daily. It is heard that in Hangzhou, the timber merchants waiting for sales in this industry almost have living expenses that exceed the value of the timber. Recently, more and more timber has been transported to Hangzhou, while transporting and selling it in Shanghai is mostly loss-making. Among the timber stockpiled in Hangzhou, local wood accounts for 40%, and Hui wood and western Zhejiang wood account for 50-60%.

Most of the people who have been dealing with Min wood round logs and other timber recently are not people in the industry and still hold the wartime single-gang business methods. Therefore, there is quite a lot of the above timber in Shanghai. In Shanghai, square timber is the most important, and foreign timber is the main source of square timber. Round logs are mainly sold in the countryside of northern Jiangsu during the winter every year as a need for building houses, and sales are very small at other times.

[Another Report] A batch of Taiwanese tiles was previously transported from Shanghai by Shanghai merchants and sold very well. It is heard that another batch will be able to be installed in Shanghai for sale in early next month.

### Zhejiang Silk Factories Have Started Work, Sichuan Silk Cannot Be Exported

The water in Zhejiang is relatively stable, so all silk factories have now started silk production, and dozens of dan of raw silk have been transported to Shanghai. The water in Jiangsu is relatively far away, resulting in few who are starting work. The China Sericulture Company requires export silk to meet standards, so it has notified all silk factories that have taken out loans last week to hand over the raw silk they have produced to the company for collection.

Also, the actual amount of the spring silkworm loan is 1,688,477 yuan, which has been recorded in previous reports. According to the person in charge of the business office of the China Sericulture Company, the amount of the loan that the Hefeng Xieji Silk Factory in the spring silkworm loan approved factories has loaned is 40.95 million yuan. Therefore, the actual amount of goods released is 1,694. New silk produced in Sichuan has recently entered the market in large quantities, but due to transportation difficulties, exports have been hindered, and the market price has been declining day by day, from 2,250,000 yuan per dan to 2,000,000 yuan, with no one accepting it. Silk merchants are currently trying to transport it to Shanghai for sale.

Artificial Silk Auction To Have Different Rules

Recently, the amount of enemy property artificial silk transported to this city by the China Trust Production Committee has been quite considerable. It is heard that the China Trust Bureau is slightly modifying the auction method in order to prevent a few people from manipulating it and to enable both large and small factories to bid. Once the method is revised, the artificial silk will be auctioned.

### Banking Law Should Be Revised Again, The Way Out for the Financial Industry Lies in Stability of the Situation, Li Fucun Delivers Important Speech

Shanghai is the economic center of the country. Since the victory, speculative capital has been rampant and has become a speculative market. The use of deposits by the financial industry has become a major problem. According to Li Fucun, chairman of the Banking Association, since the enemy surrendered, the political situation has been unstable, transportation has been blocked, and prices have soared. Under these circumstances, the financial industry has naturally failed to fulfill its responsibility to support industry and commerce, and most of its businesses have not been reasonable. Li emphasized the way out for the financial industry, saying that the financial industry will have a way out only when the situation is stable. Because with a stable political situation, restored transportation, smooth flow of goods, and prosperous industry and commerce, the financial industry's business can naturally exert its proper function. Li continued, Currently, most banks invest in the commercial sector, in addition to handling remittances. Very few loans are made to factories, and a portion is transferred to loans for silkworms, cotton, etc. Some even take risks to engage in speculation. Regarding the issue of stabilizing surplus financing, Li said, I always abide by the central policy and follow the methods stipulated by the Central Bank. Li believes that the Central Bank's measures are very appropriate. Regarding the general proposal to adjust interest rates, Li said in an objective tone that this matter is not simple and should be studied more from the facts. The reporter also inquired about his opinion on the revised Banking Law. Li said that there is still a need for revision, and said: I am currently discussing with the Legislative Yuan the points that should be revised, because the situation in our country is special, the bank regulatory laws should follow the British broad approach, and should not adopt the American tight policy. The issues of real estate mortgages should all be re-studied and revised, and a concrete decision can be made recently, at which time new banking regulations will be promulgated.

### Tallow Oil Price Increase Not Diminished

In the past, summer was a slow season for tallow oil sales. Since the rise of soap factories, it has turned into a lively season. At the beginning of this month, the use of soap has greatly increased, and sales have suddenly become strong. The market has risen sharply. Although it seems stable now, the remaining heat has not subsided, and there is still the possibility of continued increases. Moreover, the passenger and freight of this city have been completed, but the industry's hands are not weak, and they are all waiting for prices to estimate. However, Hangzhou, Lanxi, Hankou and other places have reported price increases, so the price increase will not be diminished for a while. Each industry's selling prices increase with the market, with Heben tallow oil at 85,000 yuan, Neiping oil at 80,000 yuan, Du Zhu at 78,000 yuan, Lan Shan at 75,000 yuan, and Macheng oil at 72,000 yuan.

### Textile Construction Production Increase Plan

Yarn and Cloth Increase by About One Half, Yarn Debt in Various Parts of Southeast Asia Rises Sharply

The Textile Construction Company will soon increase production. Cotton yarn is currently produced at 1,000 bales per day, and it plans to increase to 1,500 bales. Cloth is currently produced at 18,000 pieces per day, and it plans to increase to 26,000 pieces, an average increase of about one-half.

Recently, the cotton yarn market has fluctuated slightly, especially the 20-count Double Horse brand produced by Shen Xin Factory, which has become popular and has risen to more than 1.5 million, with a continued upward trend. It is reported that in the past, the cotton yarn market was more stable than other prices. The reason for this fluctuation is due to the stimulation of other prices and the impact of the rise of gold notes. The price of 20-count Double Horse brand in various parts of Southeast Asia is as high as 2 million yuan per bale, so sales are smoother and prices are even higher. It is heard that the cotton yarn sold by the Textile Construction Company recently has been more than 1,000 bales.

### Holders Hoarding, Spot Cotton Transactions Rare

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph continued to rise, soaring 34 to 46 pounds. The near-term price was US$29.98, the long-term price was US$30.17, and the current price of Meiteling was US$30.612. The current cotton market in this port is looking high, because American cotton is becoming more and more expensive, and most holders are hoarding fire, making it difficult for the two parties to reach an agreement, resulting in very few transactions. Only Wuxi Shenxin Third Factory purchased 200 bales of ordinary Meiteling at a factory price of 120,000 yuan. In addition, Hua Hao once made 400 bales of Uruguayan cotton at a warehouse price of US$50.

### Source of Subsidized Flour Becomes a Problem, Currently Will Be Temporarily Suspended

[This Newspaper Report] In the past, due to soaring rice prices, it was difficult for ordinary people to obtain grain. Wu Ju, director of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, specially obtained approval from the Shanghai Special Envoy Office of the Ministry of Food to allocate 1,500 bags of flour every day for distribution to rice shops in the suburbs for subsidized sales. The initial price was 200 yuan per catty, and it was later reduced to 150 yuan. Each household was limited to a maximum of six catties per day. Each rice shop was allocated 20 bags per day, up to 30 bags, and all were sold out. Ordinary poor people benefited greatly, but as supply fell short of demand, there were many cases of rushing. The bureau then discussed with the Civil Affairs Department to inform the district offices to first investigate poor households and prepare to distribute them with tickets. This procedure is about to be completed, but the Food Department Office has been ordered to withdraw, and the office has formally informed that it will be temporarily suspended. If it needs to be continued in the future, it will be discussed with the Storage and Transportation Office, but there is news that the Storage and Transportation Office will be set up slowly. It is said that it is currently uncertain whether subsidized flour can continue.

### Wenzhou New Zhenmei Tea, More Than 100 Boxes Traded Yesterday

Each Basket Quoted at 160,000 Yuan

Zhenmei green tea, which is sold to European and American countries, has been restarted after the victory of the War of Resistance, and tea industry insiders have returned to prepare for production. In particular, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, because of its land relations, has the earliest tea cultivation. This year's new goods have been produced and have been transported to Shanghai a few days ago. Unfortunately, due to the high cost, the foreign limit price is very tight, which has caused many difficulties in exports. So far, no transactions have been made. Recently, tea merchants are still actively seeking ways to expand. Yesterday, more than 100 boxes were traded on the market, which were absorbed by a tea shop in this city for trial sales. The quoted price was 160,000 yuan per dan. At this price, the seller can still earn a small profit, but the export industry may not be optimistic. As for various domestic sales teas, the holders are determined to sell, but the shops and merchants in this street have enough appetite, so there are not many transactions, and the situation continues to be stable. However, Taiwanese black tea and bud tea sell very well in Yixing, Wuxi, and other areas, and the market atmosphere is finally lifted up.

### Seafood Sources Decreased

The seafood market has all changed, mostly because transportation has been hampered, resulting in reduced sources. Dried scallops, shrimp tails, sea cucumbers, and dried abalones continued to rise. Vermicelli was particularly outstanding. Although the sales of various gangs are clear, the bottom is still firm.

### Nanhua Line Transportation Flourishing

British Ship Brings Large Amount of Banknotes

[This Newspaper Report] Transportation on the Nanhua Line is flourishing. Yesterday and today, a large batch of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and miscellaneous grains were transported to Xiamen, You Tou, and Guangdong. The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Wan left yesterday afternoon at about 4 pm, heading straight for Shantou, loaded with 30,000 pieces of soybean cakes, more than 1,770 bags of soybeans, 210 bags of sesame seeds, 385 bags of wheat, 19 pieces of fabrics, and more than 320 pieces of cotton yarn. The Taikoo Company's Hubei ship sailed to Hong Kong this morning, also landing at Xiamen. In addition to more than 10 trucks of relief supplies from the Relief Administration being transported to Xiamen, there were more than 300 pieces of passenger and freight fabrics, more than 10,000 pieces of soybean cakes, and more than 1,500 bags of soybeans. Today, the company's Niuzhuang ship will sail to Guangdong with a large amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, about 7,000 pieces. Based on the current water freight, it is about 280 million yuan strong. The total freight of this ship for quick groceries is more than 300 million yuan strong, breaking the unprecedented freight record in the coastal waters of China.

Another report, the Blue Funnel Company's Hardingdun arrived in Shanghai from the UK yesterday. It is heard that 368 boxes of banknotes were transported.

### Siam's Economic Construction

Using Surplus Rice to Exchange for Materials

[United Press Bangkok, 25th] Due to the widespread famine in Asia, the small country of Siam has jumped to become the country with the brightest economic future in Southeast Asia. Siam is now preparing to accumulate rice worth the equivalent of £18,000,000 of foreign debt next year. The UK is importing 15 million yards of cloth into Siam, which is a material that any Asian country east of India urgently needs. British and American military transport, agricultural, and financial experts are working hard to help the country. The United States is preparing to supply Siam with US$15,000,000 worth of military surplus materials such as trucks. In June, 800 railway carriages and 40 locomotives will arrive in Siam. Military officers in the Pacific region in charge of clearing surplus materials are working hard to supply Siam's needs. On the other hand, Siam is also working hard to increase the planting and production of food with the help of experts.

### Tung Oil Production Sharply Reduced

Before the war, my country's tung oil monopolized the world market. The annual output was 1.36 million metric tons. According to people in the industry, the post-war output is only 20-30% of that. During the war, some tung oil production areas were destroyed by war; even in oil-producing areas that were not affected by the war, most of the tung trees showed signs of withering. The reason for this is that the price of food has risen, and farmers in oil-producing areas have switched to planting miscellaneous grains. It is heard that in the past, one dan of tung oil could be exchanged for four dan of rice. Currently, it can only be exchanged for one dan, so farmers' interest in planting tung trees has decreased, and production has also decreased greatly.

China's tung oil production accounts for more than 95% of the world's total production. Since 1934, China's tung oil exports have surpassed tea and ranked first among exported goods, making a great contribution to the national economy. In 1937, the United States imported more than 174 million pounds of tung oil from China.

### Tianjin Launches Scientific Offensive to Destroy Locust Breeding Grounds

— Special Correspondent Ji Shaolin

This Newspaper's Tianjin Airmail Report, 23rd

Near Tianjin are two rice-producing areas, one is Xiaozhan, and the other is Junliangcheng. The former was developed by Li Hongzhang's Huai Army, and the latter was used by the Japanese during our War of Resistance, who spent several years trying to build it into a fully scientific and mechanized base for a large agricultural farm of 500,000 mu. I would like to report on the situation of this large farm later. Here, what the reporter describes is a recent disaster encountered in the Junliangcheng area - a locust plague. This locust plague spread over an area 40 li wide from east to west and 10 li deep from north to south. After it was discovered, the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute mobilized 27 technicians and obtained assistance from the Tianjin United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Office, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch, and the US Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin. After more than a hundred days of struggle, the locust plague was finally extinguished. Using scientific methods to control locusts was a first in this area.

### Locust Plague Originated in Junliangcheng, Two-Pronged Attack

The locust plague occurred in early June. According to a post-event investigation, this group of small animals originated in the Qilihai Lake marsh grassland area 30 li north of Junliangcheng. Initially, they launched a two-pronged attack south, crossing dozens of li of wasteland and reaching the area near the old Jintang Highway. One route窜 (fled) towards Zhang Guizhuang, 20 li west of Junliangcheng, while the main force殺奔 (rushed towards) Junliangcheng. At this time, they split into four routes and launched a frontal assault on the Junliangcheng area, with each route ranging from 7 li wide to 3-4 li wide. Where the locust swarm went, the ground was almost completely covered by these small animals, and crops were雯時 (immediately) eaten clean.

The reporter went to the disaster area for inspection on the 22nd. A corn stalk left the deepest impression on me. The leaves of this corn stalk, which was more than three feet tall, had been completely eaten, leaving only a bald trunk, like a wooden stick inserted in the ground. As far as the disaster situation is concerned, it is fortunate that it was not very serious, because most of the wheat had matured, and the farmers rushed to harvest it after discovering the locusts, and just when the locust was encroaching on the rice seedlings in the irrigated area, it was extinguished. The autumn harvest crops were more affected, and some wheat was harvested prematurely, reducing the yield by several percent.

### Experts from Beiping Rush to Tianjin to Launch Annihilation War

The Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of Beiping received a report on the 8th of this month. After an investigation, on the 14th, Liu Tingwei, a pest and disease expert, led 20 agricultural students and 6 teachers to Tianjin to rush to the disaster area, start defense, and launch an annihilation war. The locust can only fly after reaching the fifth instar, and its moving ability can reach 200 li around. The larvae stage is called locust nymphs, and the jumping ability can advance one li per day. The first discovery in the disaster area was a large number of nymphs in the third and fourth instars. In the last few days, there were swarms of flying locusts. According to Mr. Liu Tingwei, locusts have a habit of often acting collectively in large groups. When carrying out annihilation warfare, they often take advantage of this characteristic to control them with medicated baits insecticide treatment, but this time the locust swarm entered between the old Jintang Highway and the Beining Railway. This area is crisscrossed by ditches and overgrown with reeds. The locust swarm began to disperse, which is a disadvantageous terrain for carrying out the annihilation warfare. However, Li Dai Tao Jiang (one thing replaces another), the reeds have suffered the disaster in place of the crops, so it should also be said to be an advantageous area.

### Tianjin US Marine Corps Fire Attack on Locust Nests

In terms of tactics: This locust control operation employed several different methods simultaneously. The main method was to spread poisoned bait across the farmland and spray insecticide in the thickets. However, in order to kill the flying locusts and prevent further infestations within a two-hundred-mile radius, the Tianjin-based US Marine Corps was mobilized. Using the latest flame-throwing weapons, they launched an offensive against the locust nests. The National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration office handled the negotiations and immediately obtained permission from the US military authorities. Thirty-five US Marines, carrying twelve flamethrowers, went into battle on the 22nd. Because the reporter arrived in the disaster area a little late, they were unable to witness their battle, but could only make a post-battle visit to those battlefields. The flamethrowers were concentrated on several ponds where locusts were clustered, covering a total area of more than ten acres. The burned reeds were scattered haphazardly on the water, and dead locusts floated on the surface, showing no apparent resistance to the flames. According to eyewitnesses, the results were extraordinarily good. Afterwards, I patrolled the fields, where poisoned bait was everywhere, and the corpses of locust nymphs were scattered all over the ground. The arsenic lime mixed with sugar lured them to eat it, resulting in their internal organs being burned to a crisp, and they died there.

### Be Careful of Their Return: Locust Plague Nearing End

The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration branch temporarily established a method of exchanging five catties of locust nymphs for one catty of flour to encourage farmers to kill locust nymphs, and has already collected and exchanged ten thousand catties of locust nymphs. This locust plague can also be considered a cruel war. Now that the locusts' main camp has been destroyed and the locusts' main force has been defeated, the main five hundred and eighty acres of rice paddies and two hundred acres of variety testing fields have been preserved, and the locust plague is coming to an end.

The reporter once asked Mr. Liu Tingwei where the breeding grounds of locust nymphs in North China are. He said that they mostly originate in the alluvial delta areas of the Yellow River basin, including the Tianjin area, the Weishan Lake area, the Pi (County) Qiu (County) area, and the Kaifeng area. He is not very optimistic about the outlook for this locust plague. He said: If the root cause is not fundamentally treated in the breeding grounds, they may reappear after the autumn harvest. It is said that flying locusts have a strong sense of homeland. Although the first generation of offspring fly to other places, the third generation will definitely fly back to the place of the first generation. There is also a popular saying in Junliangcheng: "South in spring, north in autumn," saying that they move from north to south in spring and from south to north in autumn. Will they make a comeback? The situation after autumn is worth noting.

### Our 8th Air Transport Group in Tokyo

— Zhu Minwei

It is early summer, and the American military uniforms at Atsugi Air Base in Japan are the same as those of the American military in Jiangwan, Shanghai, wearing yellow khaki military fatigues. At Atsugi Air Base, as in Shanghai, Kunming, and Chengdu, small jeeps are used to run errands and large jeeps are used to transport supplies. The American standardized clothing, actions, and the tall and sturdy figures of the soldiers, combined with their smooth and efficient way of handling things, have spread American utilitarian culture around the world.

Tokyo City Tour

A jeep was specially driven over to spray the just-landed B24 with DDT, inside and out. Americans love to use their resources to fulfill their regulations, without empty talk or sentimentality. (You can't imagine visiting someone on horseback and then having the host order someone to wash the entire horse after you dismount.) Then they asked:

"Is anyone guarding this B24?"

"No. Our guards are staying at the main field."

"That's good, we'll send an MP to guard it day and night for you."

Vehicles were sent to transport Captain Qian's group to Tokyo. The major's car was a sedan, grass-gray in color, with sofas inside. Officers below the rank of captain used jeeps. The jeeps drove from Atsugi Air Base along a gravel road towards Tokyo, thirty miles northeast. The jeep was driven by a Japanese driver, while the sedan was driven by an American driver. The dust raised on the road was even thicker than in western China, but the road was very flat, without any unevenness. The hills on both sides of the road were all planted with terraced rice paddies, and the green color covered the mountains and fields, without a single piece of wasteland. Passing through the Yokohama city area, seeing the dilapidated city scene bombed by American planes, one was reminded of the fierce fighting in the sky and on the ground here eight months ago. After arriving in downtown Tokyo, the US military drove Captain Qian and others to a Chinese-run hotel. This hotel was formerly the Mitsui & Co. Club. In Tokyo, where land is so expensive, the Mitsui Club's two gardens, covering a total area of eighteen acres, with ponds, rockeries, trees, and small bridges, formed a secluded environment beyond the noise of the city streets.

On the 28th, Chief Zhu Shimin and Division Commander Dai Jian went to the Allied headquarters in Nagoya for a meeting and to inspect the barracks of the Chinese occupation forces in Japan. Qian Zulun and his party were left with free time for independent visits and travel. Everyone was visiting Japan for the first time, and as soldiers of the victorious nation in the occupied territories, everything had to conform to the customs of the occupying forces created by the US military here. Therefore, everyone put on the military uniforms that were not for battle, the dark green broadcloth uniforms tailored during their time studying in the United States, and when going out, they had to ride in sedans or jeeps according to their rank. The first goal, of course, was to tour the streets of Tokyo.

After nine months of occupation, the traces of war in Tokyo city are no longer very visible. Most of the bombed houses in the urban areas have undergone some artificial renovation. Although there are still broken walls and ruins, there are no piles of ashes. As for the roads, no bomb craters can be seen, and they have long been filled with asphalt and smoothed out. The car drove smoothly without bouncing anywhere. The Ginza, the bustling district of Tokyo, Ueno Park, a scenic area, as well as the Meiji Emperor's tomb and Admiral Togo's tomb in the suburbs, were all visited.

A Deep Impression

The performance of the Japanese in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation after the war is currently not too much worse than before the war. This shows that MacArthur's approach is not simply a military solution. In Japan, MacArthur does not allow the existence of military affairs and heavy industry, but in maintaining the survival of the defeated Japanese people, this old general is "trying to let the Japanese work as much as possible and also let the Japanese eat their fill." Now Japan's rice is sold by the government, and people buy a fixed amount of rice at certain times. Of course, this amount is less than needed, but it can prevent the Japanese from starving to death. In addition, MacArthur's headquarters enabled most of the silk mills and yarn mills in Japan that could be put into operation to be put into operation, and found markets for Japanese products in the United States, and even used ships to transport these Japanese goods to exchange for American flour, so as to fill the stomachs of working Japanese with bread.

Because the Japanese have been defeated in the war, they do not pay attention to their appearance and dress casually. Almost all men of military age wear short and tight Japanese military uniforms, with narrow-brimmed caps that cover their eyebrows, just like the appearance of Japanese prisoners of war we see in Beijing, Shanghai, and along the Yangtze River, except that all the symbols indicating rank have been removed. Most women wear Western-style clothes, like the Japanese women commonly seen in the Hongkou area of Shanghai, and some also wear a kind of flight suit-like attire with a shirt attached to pants.

They themselves hold a concept: "After losing the war, everything must be started from scratch, like a craftsman facing a ruined house that has fallen in a storm, knowing that hard years lie ahead, and this starting point is certainly even more bitter"! They are also very quiet, because the house has collapsed, but a layer of fear of destruction has been removed. Just look at their leisure fishing near "Sukiyabashi" (bridge name), and you can see a glimpse.

The Japanese have no dignity to speak of, so they simply abandon face. In Chinese restaurants or other Japanese cafeterias, Qian Zulun and his friends gave the leftover squid to Japanese female diners, and these women gratefully accepted and ate it. Because they were eating a bowl of white rice, and they considered it a luxury to be able to buy an egg to accompany the meal.

Later, they visited Atami Onsen. The thoroughness of Japan's transportation system and the density of the countryside, fields, mountains, forests, and trees left a deep impression on them. If China wants to catch up with this defeated country across the sea, these two things alone will require some unremitting spirit and arduous years. (16th · Shanghai)

### Let Me Talk About National Affairs Too

Editor: I have witnessed that left-leaning writers in current books, newspapers, and magazines often attribute the blame to the government, which deeply and intensely influences people's minds. Driven by patriotism, I find it difficult to tolerate their confusion of black and white, and I would like to discuss today's national affairs with those people.

Nowadays, when people talk about the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, they often blame the Kuomintang. Many extremists even believe that the Kuomintang has a hundred wrongs and no rights, while the Communist Party has a hundred rights and no wrongs. We, who have a little reason and conscience, can no longer tolerate their distortion of right and wrong, and must also express our opinions:

(1) No More Delay! — Opposition to civil war is the unanimous demand of the whole country. What is the reality? After many people's mediation, several negotiations, and several cease-fire agreements, it always stops and starts again, fights and stops again, talks and fights simultaneously, fights and talks simultaneously. Such negotiations and such ceasefires have been going on for ten months since the victory, and the people of the whole country are still suffering from the pain of war, unable to return home as refugees, unable to stabilize their lives, with economic panic, and the obstruction of rehabilitation. The people are unanimously condemning the government, and the government is also distressed by the fact that the entire fiscal budget cannot be balanced and economic policies are often hindered. The root cause is that the country's transportation cannot be unified, materials cannot circulate, and government orders cannot be widely implemented, right? Therefore, as far as the government is concerned, it must also be very averse to civil war. The current path to peace is for the Communist Party to lay down its weapons and for the government to reorganize. If both parties compromise in this way, the whole country will be peaceful and unified, and both parties can compete for power in a democratic manner. According to the current situation, the Kuomintang may still be the dominant party, and it is not difficult to win back the lost hearts of the people by reforming and seeking self-improvement. The Communist Party, not having the certainty of seizing power, pins its only hope on deteriorating the chaotic situation, dragging it out until the people are destitute. At that time, the people will no longer be able to trust the government and will no longer be able to tolerate the reality, and then the rioters will think that an excellent opportunity has arrived. To seek peace in this way is like climbing a tree to catch a fish! — Therefore, we appeal to everyone that the situation can no longer be delayed and that the national problem must be resolved within the shortest possible time.

(2) The Northeast should be received as a whole immediately. Receiving the Northeast is based on the Cairo Agreement, the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the government's consistent policy since the September 18th Incident, and the unanimous demand of the whole country. Therefore, only the government recognized at home and abroad today can receive the sovereignty of the Northeast. It is a matter of course, justified and right. Anyone who attempts to forcibly occupy the Northeast is plotting wrongdoing. After our tireless appeals and the righteous and solemn support of friendly countries, it was not easy for the Soviet army to withdraw from the Northeast and for the normal national army to go to receive it. However, the Communist Party, under the guise of the people, forcibly occupied the Northeast and obstructed the government from exercising its sovereignty. Why should we tolerate this behavior that disregards the overall interests of the country? In the Communist Party's absurd theories, the same as when they borrow the meaning of "democracy" and "freedom," there is the so-called "people's sovereignty" and "people's armed forces." Anyone with a little knowledge knows that they have abused the meaning of sovereignty, and there is no need to explain it here. Just ask where this "people's armed force" comes from? It was not heard of when the enemy and puppets occupied the area; it was not heard of when the Soviet army advanced; it only came out from underground when the national army was receiving it. Isn't it mistaken the target! In addition to demanding that the government immediately receive the entire Northeast, we cannot recognize any new puppet regime's power or armed forces.

(3) Give Marshal Ma the Right of Arbitration. — Who is the fairest, of course, is the people, but there are too many opinions from the people, and it is difficult to hear the opinions of the truly majority of the people. As for Marshal Ma, of course, some people will attack him as an American, but in this chaotic situation, the only ones who can stand outside the realm of right and wrong are the Americans. So why should the United States care about the situation in China? Because in the current world situation, only with peace in China can there be peace in the Far East, and only with a strong China can the world be stable. Moreover, a chaotic China will brew the source of war, and a weak China will be coveted by strong neighbors. Therefore, the Americans care about the interests of China, which is also caring about the interests of the United States itself. The Americans seek their own safety, and indirectly must also make China safe. Because of this, we recognize Marshal Ma as a qualified mediator. "Political democratization, military nationalization," is the proposition of the Chinese people, and it is also the condition for reconciliation put forward by Marshal Ma. Since we agree with Marshal Ma's position and Marshal Ma's proposition, then in order to avoid delays, we must give Marshal Ma the power of arbitration. After the "Political Consultative Conference," the Communist Party, on the pretext that the Second Plenary Session was not in their favor, took advantage of Marshal Ma's return to his country to forcibly occupy Siping in the Northeast and destroy the ceasefire agreement in North China, which led to the current situation. As for whether the government attempted to break the contract, it is only an estimate by the Communist Party, while the Communist Party really broke the contract first! Where does the truth lie? There is a public opinion. Generally speaking, the reason why the Communist Party is still unwilling to accept Marshal Ma's arbitration is also because of this.

(4) Why does the Communist Party want to attack the Allied countries? — The Communist Party says that the United States interferes in China's internal affairs, hinders China's sovereignty, and loudly calls for "American troops to withdraw from China," and so on. These arguments are very easy to make people impulsive, but after careful consideration, isn't this the Communist Party's refusal to accept Marshal Ma's right of arbitration and attack on the US military for transporting troops for the government? The reasons for this are explained as follows: (1) No one can deny that the United States' mediation of our internal war is not interference in our internal affairs. The reasons why we are willing to do so, in addition to what was said in the previous chapter, are only for self-reproach and to engrave it in our hearts! The country has now reached such a point. May I ask, apart from this inferior strategy, is there any other way? (2) As for the United States hindering China's sovereignty, I don't know what it refers to. Apart from our voluntary granting him the right of arbitration, it seems that there has been no situation similar to that of the Soviet Union in the Northeast. It is too disproportionate for the Communist Party to blame this one instead of that one! (3) The work of the US military stationed in China is to handle the affairs of the prisoners of war and assist China in receiving the sovereign rights. I am afraid the latter is more important. Now the Japanese army has already surrendered, but the Northeast is still a problem. To be honest, the United States does not want the Northeast to become the Balkans of East Asia. The US military's stationing in China is currently a stabilizing force. Except for the Communist Party with ulterior motives, no one dislikes the US military's stationing in China at this time. (4) The Communist Party also says that the US military's transportation of troops for the government is enough to expand the civil war. We think that if the government had not recovered Changchun, there would have been no room for negotiation at all. It seems that if the Americans had not transported troops for us, let alone receiving the Northeast, I am afraid we would not have even stepped into North China! What would the situation have been like then? We must admit the fact that it is precisely because of the US military stationed in Qingdao and Dalian that the civil war in North China has not expanded; it is precisely because of the strengthening of the national army in the Northeast that the current negotiating situation has been left. If it is a mistake for the US military to transport troops for the government, then the Communist Party should also think about how the "Northeast Allied Army" was established? Without this instigator, the Kuomintang-Communist problem would not have occurred in the Northeast at all. The Communist Party is so harsh on others and lenient on itself, and the people of the world are not entirely deceivable.

Finally, I appeal to the left-leaning intellectuals to pay attention: you attack the US military for arming the government army, but how can you still force the government to recognize the bandits armed by the Soviet army in the Northeast? You attack the government for not being sincere in the negotiations, but why do you allow the Communist army to be rampant in the Northeast and launch wars in various parts of Shandong? Your one-sided arguments only fuel the arrogance of the Communist Party and are of no help to the country or the people!

What time is this? What world is this? I ask the intellectuals to bring out their conscience, recognize the facts, and stop shouting and cheering for the ambitious! Wei Boqiao, June 20th.

### From Liaoyang to Siping: A Seven-Day Siping Dispatch

— Guan Rongqin

Seven-Day Siping Dispatch

After a hurried farewell to a few friends, I, the reporter, boarded a carriage and rushed to the train station to catch the 2:00 PM train. I had stayed in Liaoyang for over forty days. Had I known I would stay so long, I would have become restless. But as the time to leave approached, I felt a bit reluctant. To be honest, I didn't like the obstacles and fortifications every five steps or every ten steps in Liaoyang. Yet, I loved many things besides the obstacles and fortifications. Indeed, Liaoyang produced several "famous" traitors, such as Yu Chonghan and Yuan Jinkai. The buildings built with the blood and sweat of our Northeastern compatriots – the Yu family's and Yuan family's – still stand tall in this ancient mountain city, diminishing its charm. Yet, they cannot erase its innate beauty.

Everything is Verdant Green, but Fields Cannot Be Planted

The Tang Pagoda stands healthily towering over the West Station, having withstood countless wind and rain erosion! Century after century, it still appears so "vigorous in old age"! Then, there's the Confucian Temple, also adorned with historical wrinkles: the courtyards surrounding Confucius and the "Seventy-Two Sages," where is there not a lush green carpet of vegetation? Perhaps because it quietly stands in the eastern corner of the city, there are fewer visitors. Stepping through the temple gate, if you weren't wearing squeaky leather shoes, you'd surely hear the buzzing of flies and mosquitoes. Its serenity offers a perfect contrast to the noisy streets filled with clattering carts and flying dust. Moreover, there's the Martial Temple – the Temple of Guan Yu and the Kui Xing Tower – also located in the eastern part of the city. Indeed, they are surrounded by fortifications, barbed wire, electric fences, and the like, symbolizing unease. However, you will not forget that Liaoyang is indeed the earliest built county town in Liaoning Province, even older than Shenyang.

Traveling north from Liaoyang (only reaching Siping Street) is like traveling south from Liaoyang: along the railway line, one sees lush greenery everywhere, swaying in the wind. Recalling the scene from two months ago will give you the feeling of entering another world. To prevent bandits from sabotaging transportation, the authorities issued an order long ago: no crops are allowed to be planted within five li on both sides of the railway. Five jia on each side, totaling ten li. Someone managing the railroad should calculate how much land in the Northeast cannot be cultivated! In a country plagued by famine where people and animals eat each other, the phenomenon of having fields but not being allowed to plant them is absurd, unless you're a fool and don't find it strange!

Several Large Stations, Tracks Like Spiderwebs

From Liaoyang to Siping, one passes through several large stations: namely Sujiatun, Shenyang, Tieling, and Kaiyuan. Sujiatun may not be a large place, but the Sujiatun Railway Station is the first in our country and the third in the world. One can imagine its size. Whether it is that big still needs to be verified. I only know that when arriving at the station, looking out from the train window, one sees dense, parallel tracks that extend endlessly, tiring the eyes and spirit. Shenyang is naturally also a large station, but the number of parallel tracks is not as many as Sujiatun. Tieling is also considered a large station. It's 180 li from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and 120 li from Shenyang to Tieling. It is said that Tieling used to be an industrial area. However, the impression this "former industrial area" county town gives the reporter is only of some empty, large buildings in the suburbs. They look grand from the outside, but looking in through the blackened windows, one would never imagine they were factories. If someone hadn't told me beforehand, I would have suspected those buildings were haunted houses, burned by people afraid of ghosts. The streets within Tieling are still neat, with green trees standing regularly on both sides. Stalls selling Japanese goods occupy two or three main streets, where the crowds are like a sea, always pushing and shoving.

Kaiyuan Divided into Two Cities, Eighteen Li Apart

It is only sixty li from Tieling to Kaiyuan, and the train arrives in one hour. Kaiyuan is divided into two cities, new and old, with a distance of eighteen li between them. The new city is much better than the old city, undoubtedly because the Japanese residential area is in the new city. New Kaiyuan was the foothold for the National Army's previous attacks on Siping, Xifeng, and other places. Although the National Army has advanced far away, it still leaves behind many rear supply stations. Fortresses and barbed wire give these "stations" an air of authority. The streets of New Kaiyuan are neat, but because recovery is difficult, many places are still unresolved. For example, the land registration books here were taken away by the retreating Eighth Route Army, resulting in many unclear property disputes. Often, the county magistrate or the head of the finance department must handle them. The remaining Japanese residents are gradually returning to their country or gathering in one place. The vacated clean houses are either occupied by current railway employees or have their doors and windows nailed shut with wooden boards, on which are pasted labels like "×× Police Officer's Residence" or "×× Team Leader's Residence." The Japanese who have not left continue to sell the items they cannot take with them, and there are many cheap things. However, once they pass through the hands of speculators, the prices are several times higher. Books are still cheap, five yuan a jin, but few people buy them. Some Japanese people don't want the books to fall into the hands of our compatriots, so they burn them. Many students patrol in groups, specifically searching for books about to be thrown into the fire to enrich their school libraries.

The Flames of War Have Subsided, but Landmines Still Explode

The Shenyang-Japanese passenger train resumed service on June 1st. I, the reporter, took a military special train from Kaiyuan to Siping on May 28th.

Like other cities in the Northeast, Siping is divided into two areas: one is the Japanese residential area, and the other is the "Manchu" area. The buildings and sanitation are very different in the two areas. Standing on the high and long "Bridge" and looking around: the west is the Japanese residential area, and the east is the "Manchu" area. The former is called "Dao Xi" (West of the Road), and the latter is called "Dao Dong" (East of the Road). Dao Dong has tall buildings, the streets are neat, wide, and flat, and there are green trees along the streets that are several feet tall. Now it is "chaotic to live in", but the place is still clean. Dao Xi has few tall buildings, and although the streets are still neat, it is not easy to find even stone roads. The ditches are not cleaned, filth is everywhere, there are no trees, and low-class brothels are everywhere. The flames of war have subsided for over half a month, but the landmines buried by the Communist army still "boom" day and night. During the war, it is said that hundreds of innocent civilians died. Walking the streets and suburbs, one often smells the stench of corpses and hears complaints. The train station, burned down to a blackened skeleton, and the suburban buildings, with thousands of holes and wounds, are especially unforgettable for people.

Visiting Key Figures in the Provincial Government, Discussing the Current Situation of Recovery

To understand the current state of recovery, I visited the local authorities: first, I visited Chairman Liu of the provincial government. Unfortunately, he was out on official business, so I had to present my card to request an audience with Mr. Zhang Shilun, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. The busy Director Zhang received the reporter with such leisure, which immediately gave me an unusually deep impression. Director Zhang said: The provincial government moved back to Siping on May 18th and immediately started working. Originally, the provincial government had completed the takeover on January 8th of this year, but after the Soviet army withdrew, the Communist army immediately came to seize it. The security team under the command of the provincial government, regardless of their weak forces and inferior weapons, rose up to resist, fighting from March 12th to March 17th, and finally retreated due to the disparity in strength. In total, 700 people were sacrificed, and nearly 1,000 were injured. Most of the personnel under Chairman Liu of the provincial government were captured. Although this battle was a defeat, it was the first instance in the post-recovery Northeast of the provincial government independently resisting the Communist army with its own forces. Talking about why the Communist army wanted to seize Siping and defend it to the death, Director Zhang said there were three reasons: First, they saw that the Northeast problem would be resolved through political negotiations by the government. To enhance their power at the negotiating table, they had to fight fiercely in Siping, Changchun, and other major places to show their strength; Second, Siping is a key point in the Northeast, a political and military hub of the Northeast. By occupying it, they could cut off the connection of the National Army heading north and coordinate with the Communist army in Changchun and its vicinity; Third, Siping still had materials left over from the enemy and puppet regime, which they wanted to plunder. Speaking of the problem of internal staff in the provincial government, Director Zhang said that those above the recommended grade mostly came from the rear, while those above the commissioned grade were mostly recruited locally: this was not because there was a distinction in the use of personnel, but because local personnel (many of whom were university students) had rarely had relatively important work experience during the puppet Manchukuo era. Speaking of the takeover and security situation of the counties, Director Zhang said: All counties in Liaobei had completed the takeover, except for Tongliao County, where the county government was temporarily located in Liaoning Province due to poor security. The security situation in all counties was not a major issue. Finally, talking about the takeover problem, Director Zhang said that the so-called takeover was just a few half-broken houses, and the materials were scarce.

However, according to Mayor Yang's reply: "We have to do it anyway; even if we do it slowly, it's better than staying still. We have to create the environment"!

### Social Services: Answering Readers

Medical and Health

(1) Shen Ruijun asks: I have been suffering from a type of ringworm on my neck for the past few years. The pain is extreme. I have used various ringworm medications on the market, but not only have they not been effective, but they have gradually spread, occupying half of my neck. I sincerely ask if you have any special medicine or can introduce me to a dermatologist. I would be extremely grateful.

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] There is no special medicine, but X-rays can be used for treatment. You may want to consult Dr. You Pengxi, whose address can be found in the telephone directory.

(2) Fei Cun asks: My sister Chun was born in the sixth month of pregnancy, commonly known as a "June report." She is now seventeen years old but has not developed, still like a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl. I would like to ask several questions: (1) Is her lack of development due to congenital deficiency? (2) What is the usual age for development? (3) Will it affect her future fertility and the children she may have?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renxu, Doctor of Medicine] (1) It is indeed a congenital deficiency. (2) Whether she will develop in the future depends on the situation. You can consult a pediatrician. (3) If she does not develop fully, it will certainly affect her fertility. (3) Pingpingjun asks: Dear editor: I am a young student. As a child, I accidentally injured my ankle, and soon my leg became red and swollen, with cramps in the joints and excruciating pain. After being diagnosed by Chinese and Western doctors as bone tuberculosis (i.e., what Chinese medicine calls penetrating bone flow), I was told to rest and receive injections and take medicine at the same time, but it was ineffective. Unexpectedly, before long, the leg suddenly ulcerated, and the illness became even more dangerous. Doctors were helpless, and medicine had no effect, and finally, it became a stubborn and incurable chronic bone tuberculosis. Later, during the Anti-Japanese War, the environment was harsh, and I could not continue treatment. During that time, the condition sometimes worsened and sometimes eased. Now I write to ask for medical advice, hoping to cure my chronic illness once and for all.

[Answer by Dr. Tang Ren, Doctor of Medicine] It is bone tuberculosis and should be treated by a bone specialist. The future depends on the degree of progression of pulmonary tuberculosis.

### Inquiry into the Grain Loan Case

— Shaofu

The grain loan case is still under investigation, and the time has been prolonged for a long time. Although the common people are very anxious and hope that the truth will come out soon, they think that the judicial process must be thoroughly investigated and the evidence must be conclusive before a verdict can be made, so they can still be patient.

However, it would be wrong to think that by dragging things out, a big thing can be turned into a small thing, and a small thing can be turned into nothing. To be honest, if this grain loan case cannot be handled clearly, the subsequent impact is really unknown.

Now, there are many people on the streets and alleys who have gone from whispering to shouting loudly. They say: During the dark and corrupt period of the puppet organization, a major case was handled, which made people very happy. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, under the National Government's consistent policy of eradicating corruption, they believe that things will never be handled vaguely.

What makes people wonder and worry is that two agencies are competing to handle this case. On this, we do not necessarily firmly advocate which agency should handle it, whether it is the court or the Garrison Headquarters. However, there is one principle that we adhere to, and that is that it must be public and must be handled impartially!

Yesterday, the two grain officials, Wang and Ren, were escorted to the Garrison Headquarters. It is said that during the interrogation, the testimonies of some grain merchants and Wang Daren involved the Ministry of Food and Minister Xu Kan. The military law office has sent a letter to the Ministry of Food to investigate the truth, but has not yet received a reply.

We suggest that the Garrison Headquarters immediately summon Xu Kan and relevant personnel from the Ministry of Food. We know that during the gold bribery case in Chongqing last year, the Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun was summoned to the court to testify. Therefore, we believe that Minister Xu will definitely step forward to ensure that the investigation of this case can be completed as soon as possible. Otherwise, what will people think?

### About the Longhua Society

— Yang Hongnian

Emperor Ma's Departure Is Not True

In a metropolis like Tianjin, it is surprising that the so-called "One Heart Great Dao Longhua Holy Church General Assembly" can still exist as usual after the restoration. This cannot but be said to be due to the leniency of the authorities. The report on the 17th, an 8th-day Tianjin dispatch, although describing it in great detail, focuses more on the situation during the war and after the restoration, with little emphasis on the past. Therefore, I would like to make public what I know to inform readers.

Before the war, Tianjin was a so-called special area, especially the Japanese concession, which fully used the opportunity to create this "special" hub. Japanese rogues and special agents were constantly using these ambitious wolves in various guises to do things that would numb the people. But speaking of the origin of this "Longhua Society," it originated far away on Changshan Island, Shandong. The so-called "Emperor Ma" was a big household on the island. I don't know what kind of person encouraged him, but he actually started to make up dreams in this small village. At first, he did sell his family property to do some good deeds for the public. At the same time, the people of Shandong were complaining about Han Fuju's "Qingxiang" because Han Fuju used the policy of "fighting poison with poison" and used bandits as leaders to suppress bandits. Therefore, there were inevitably some incidents of foxes pretending to be tigers. "Emperor Ma" also took this opportunity to pull in a lot of believers, who had to donate all their family property to the church so that wealth could be evenly distributed. The uniform treatment did indeed gradually increase the number of people who were loyal to him. Slowly, his ambitions developed, from villages to towns, from towns to counties, so that he effortlessly occupied the entire Changshan. At this time, Japanese special agents provided a large amount of military supplies and sent people to assist and command, so "Emperor Ma's" reputation in Shandong was even greater than Han Fuju's. If anyone still remembers Han Fuju's "no closed doors at night" policy in Shandong, he cannot be said to have done nothing to suppress the "local emperor." But the second half of this merit was left to the Japanese. Like using Puyi, the Japanese saw that "Emperor Ma" could not stand in Shandong, and specially sent a transport ship to take him to Dalian, and then to the Japanese concession in Tianjin. Around 1929, the yellow flag of the "One Heart Heavenly Dao Longhua Holy Church" was hung at the corner of Taoshan Street and Suma Street. Another flag was inscribed with "Living from the True Great Spirit Mountain," which was quite confusing. One word in the former flag was written as —, and there was also a flag called "True Lord" and other heretical claims such as changing the monthly calendar. At this time, his followers were mostly over forty years old (there were also a few people over ten years old), wearing blue cloth robes, buttoned on the left, cloth shoes, cloth socks, and braids, all the same. They were rarely heard reciting scriptures, and at dusk, they often stood outside the door, flirting and scolding prostitutes across the street, and there were quite a few of them.

In 1937, when the National Army withdrew south and Tianjin fell, the leader of the society led his followers in a parade through the streets, while he himself sat steadily in a "Buick" sedan. He made similar cries, but it was impossible to tell what language it was, which made people suspect that he was not human. Later, the society occupied the Grand Stage in Nanshi, and also used the opening of porridge kitchens and written donations everywhere. All large shops and gentry were required to donate a certain amount, which was actually using power rather than doing good deeds. The report said that Tao Yunxiang claimed that "Emperor Ma left in 1935," which may not be true or is an intentional cover-up. His boasting about running charitable undertakings to cover up underground workers is all lies. If the society could also cover up underground workers, Japanese special agents might be even more convenient! In short, this is not some heterodox cult, but an organization with a full political function. I hope the authorities will pay attention. At the same time, I hope that the citizens of Tianjin will report everything in the past so that the authorities can better handle it. Therefore, I have recorded what I have heard.

### On "Little Red"

— Cao Zuohan

There was a textual researcher who specialized in creating indexes who said: "The Little Red in *Dream of the Red Chamber* is an allusion to Hong Chengchou, the Ming Dynasty traitor and Qing Dynasty meritorious dog, that official of two dynasties." I am not a disciple of reckless speculation and dare not comment on this statement. However, such a comparison is a bit unfair to Little Red and also a bit unfair to Hong Chengchou.

"People aspire to climb high, water flows downward," is originally a worldly sentiment. Consider Little Red's situation when she was in the Yi Hong Courtyard. She only did peripheral work, some coarse tasks outside the main house. The matters concerning Master Bao were handled by Xi Ren, Qing Wen, She Yue, Qiu Wen, and others. Furthermore, there were other old women and senior maids who formed a solid circle around the core. She had no chance to enter the inner sanctum to get close to her master, so naturally, she could not gain the master's trust and love. If servants cannot gain the master's trust and love, how can they become popular among the other servants and outshine them? Moreover, Little Red was one who coquettishly posed, thinking highly of herself. How could she be content with a silent and unnoticed existence?

In order not to waste her talents, she was waiting for an opportunity to show herself, hoping to gain a "quick promotion." Just like bachelors and masters who have just received their diplomas, they always want to be able to knock on the door of society and put on airs for a bit. This feeling is very understandable.

Unfortunately, Little Red's fate was ill-timed, opportunities were rare. It was hard to find an opportunity to take advantage of a void to step into the core, to offer some attentiveness to Master Bao, but she was quickly squeezed out by Master Bao's trusted servants. Qing Wen even poured a bucket of cold water on her head with both sarcasm and scolding. She was still bombed back to the periphery.

For her, who had high aspirations, how could she endure this? Therefore, as soon as she gained Sister Feng's favor, she immediately climbed up the high branch, happy to be of service like a dog or horse. Changing to a powerful master, she had finally achieved her initial ambition, although her personal romantic desires were still not satisfied.

Hong Chengchou, on the other hand, was in a different situation. He was originally a state minister of the Ming Dynasty, and the emperor trusted him exceptionally. People generally regarded him as a bulwark of the state. If he wanted to exhaust his loyalty, he had unlimited opportunities to exert his talents. The emperor would not wrong his talents. But he revolted and surrendered to the enemy, becoming a traitor to the emperor and a traitor to the nation, giving the Ming Dynasty's beautiful land to foreign tribes.

Therefore, comparing the two, Hong Chengchou can be said to be a petty person among gentlemen. A real petty person seems more lovable than a hypocrite, so Little Red seems a bit more intelligent than Hong Chengchou.

If Little Red isn't like Hong Chengchou, then who is she like?

Disregarding the criticism of "aping," I say: she is very much like the frustrated politicians and outdated warlords since the beginning of the Republic.

Let's discuss the history of internal fighting since the beginning of the Republic, up until the completion of the Northern Expedition. What actual significance did each battle have, stirring up trouble? Was it worth fighting to the death over? Yet, there was continuous fighting and killing. It was just a few ambitious people who thought highly of themselves and were unwilling to be ignored, seeking only to express themselves.

Today on stage, tomorrow out of office; today allied with A, tomorrow opposing B; whoever gives milk is my mother; if I'm not welcome here, I'm welcome elsewhere; all sorts of tricks to throw everything into chaos. It's just a few servants who are unwilling to accept their fate as servants stirring up trouble. Only they can understand this muddled account.

However, Little Red seems to be a bit stronger than them. Therefore, the shrewd and capable Sister Feng appreciated her. The "Grandma and Madam" account confused Li Wan, but she spoke fluently and logically, like mercury flowing to the ground. It's hard to blame her for not wanting to be ignored.

But what about those who lack talent but still don't want to be ignored? The result is harming others and ruining themselves. The politicians and warlords since the beginning of the Republic are an example. Therefore, I am deeply concerned for those who have Little Red's ambition but not Little Red's talent.

### Theatergoer on the Third Floor

— Chu Lanfu

The first day of the performance of a famous amateur performer and a famous actor was like an impulse. At 4:30 in the afternoon, I rushed to the entrance of the Tianchan Theater. Unexpectedly, the iron gate was already pulled shut, and people were squeezed outside the iron gate, which was guarded by armed police with a hint of dignity, filling the entire road. The most impatient people were pushing to the front, grabbing the iron railings, unwilling to let go. With their mouths wide open, they stared inside, like prisoners who had been imprisoned for a long time, longing for freedom behind iron bars—these people were all like me, theatergoers on the third floor, with only two thousand yuan worth of purchasing power.

I couldn't help but sigh and lament at the gate, planning to go back. On one hand, I regretted that I was a bit too late; on the other hand, I was also Q-ing myself, congratulating myself on my two thousand yuan. Just as I was hesitating, I ran into a friend who had watched a show at this theater through the back door. He looked at my anxious expression and said, "Don't leave, I'll send you up in a while!" Coincidentally, the iron gate opened a crack again, so my friend pulled me along, taking advantage of the surge of people. We didn't go through the main entrance. The main entrance was amazing. The ticket checking area had armed guards. Whoever didn't have a ticket was driven out. We took the side door.

I don't know how we walked, but I followed my friend to the third-floor viewing area. It was incredible! More than half of the entire floor was already crowded with people, and the entrance was still constantly pouring in. I hurriedly occupied a seat in the fifth row. Looking at the clock, it was only 5 o'clock. On the cold stage, there was a sign that was both polite and sarcastic—"Performance starts at 8 o'clock!" Looking down, the main hall and the second floor were neatly empty, row after row of seats, not a single person.

But our place had turned into a lively sea. The female ushers were busy making tea, shouting "Thank you..." while squeezing back and forth. The snack vendor wore a mournful face, carrying his tray, because he was squeezed and unable to move. People who were desperately saving seats were arguing with those who came later and planned to take them, their necks red. Three or four people were fighting over a pair of binoculars to look at the empty stage... The air was filled with smoke, overflowing with various noisy sounds, creating a commotion. I was lucky to have a seat, chatting with a middle-aged man in the front row. "You're late, I came at 1:30!" he said to me in Shanghai dialect, seemingly very satisfied with his position.

"What great perseverance!" I couldn't help but admire. In fact, wasn't my perseverance small? From 5 o'clock to 8 o'clock, I persisted for three hours in this lively and lonely sea, and I didn't even know how I passed the time. All third-floor theatergoers—none of their perseverance is small.

The drum sound before the performance also aroused cheers from the crowd. The play began with the lovely ability of "cloudburst in a drought". "Killing the Fish Home" moved me very much. The scene of the fisherman and his daughter being forced to kill by evil forces was quite profound; there aren't many such plays in the old dramas. After this play, many special viewers successively appeared on the stage. These people were uniformly neat, beautiful, and modern. Their elegant and refined demeanor, and their leisurely and relaxed expressions, compared to us, really gave the feeling of "heaven and earth."

The play was in progress, but I was distracted by these upper-class people for most of my attention. A tall gentleman gave me even more interest, reminding me of a humorous article on people's facial features in a newspaper. The author said: "Bizarre shapes are noble features. Many nobles or wealthy people are indeed pig-shaped." This gentleman powerfully proved the author's point.

The play quickly ended, and I squeezed out of the theater with the crowd. Hundreds of cars were parked on several roads, waiting to welcome their owners. Dragging my extremely tired body through the gaps in the cars, I pondered when there would be a reasonable place for artistic appreciation.

### Infatuated with Women, Defeated by Women

— Feng Yi

The criminal psychology of Chen Yuansheng, the main culprit in the gold brick case, is nothing more than a dissolute life and greed for money. Therefore, he was initially infatuated with women, and in the end, he was defeated by women. The four characters "wine, sex, wealth, and anger" ruined his life. At the moment he was arrested, he was still drinking alone, not expecting that "drinking to relieve sorrow only makes sorrow greater," and disaster was imminent.

Chen's age was exactly thirty, the golden age of his life. Unfortunately, he didn't know how to use his own "unlimited gold", and he wholeheartedly thought of taking shortcuts to make a fortune. As a result, he stole the national treasury's "limited gold", eventually ending up in prison. If he thought of the old saying, "One wrong step leads to eternal regret, and a hundred years to turn back," Chen would be filled with emotion. In this way, Chen's brain structure seems too simple, truly so-called self-smart, but was mistaken by smart!

Looking at Chen's behavior after the case, in the Hangzhou-Suzhou-Jiaxing area, he was searching for flowers and asking willows, mingling with women day and night, pretending to be a wealthy young master, showing an indifferent air. It is said that lust does not confuse people, but people confuse themselves. I did not expect that even in front of the Buddhist holy place Lingyin Temple, he had not yet broken the illusion. The gold bar in his pocket fell into the gully, and he still advised people that life was important and not to go down to pick it up. If Buddha is present, they will inevitably chant: "Emptiness is form, form is emptiness," Amitabha!

A short month of pleasure, in the end, tasted the iron window flavor, inevitably suffered the prison's stench. For Chen, the price paid was too high. Wine, sex, wealth, and anger can not be careful!

Shenyang reported: "Eight or nine out of ten people in Shenyang buy newspapers not to read them, but most people use the quality and quantity of paper as the standard for buying newspapers, regardless of the quality of the newspaper content." In fact, is it not the same for people in Shanghai to buy newspapers? I suspect that the millions of copies sold by the New York Times and the New York Daily News in the United States have something to do with the large-sized daily editions?

General Feng Yuxiang this time from Chongqing to Nanjing, abandoned the plane and boarded the boat, after arriving in Nanjing, did not talk about politics but specialized in water classics, it seems that water has occurred a great interest. This is probably due to being appointed to study water conservancy abroad and aroused a little inspiration. It is said that Feng said: "The problem of China is only the problem of water conservancy, Chairman Chiang governs the Yellow River, I will govern the Yangtze River, the two places govern well, China is also governed well."

### Seal Talk: Cutting with a Knife

— Gao Tianxin

There are methods for cutting with a knife: single knife, double knife, flat knife, upright knife, cutting knife, straight knife, buried knife, frustrating knife, dancing knife, flying knife, patching knife. But according to my words, there is only the distinction between single knife and double knife, other kinds, in fact, do not need to be fully believed. But must not be fully known. Because a seal is carved, in fact, all kinds are available. If relying on one kind of knife method, it is absolutely difficult to carve a good seal. Only when holding the knife, often think of it as holding a pen, do not pretend to modify, is the only way. Just like calligraphy writing, you must not add too much, do not pretend to modify, then the vitality is exuberant, will not be rigid. Also, it must be completed in one breath, with full spirit, looking at the seal face, so that it is used by me, let me play, do not be taken by the seal face.

### Oriental Thorn: Human Body Measurement

— Oriental Thorn

In the western United States, the average height of young women is five feet three inches and one-quarter, and the weight is one hundred and twenty-seven pounds; the average height of men is five feet eight inches and three-quarters, and the weight is one hundred and fifty-three and a half pounds.

This is the latest test conducted by Dr. McGann, an anthropologist at the University of California. The purpose of McGann's survey is to obtain the average length of men's and women's arms and legs for reference in improving artificial arms.

Among the one thousand men who participated in the test, there were many female college students; the one thousand eight hundred men included a very wide range, from seventeen to ninety years old.

The average length of young women's arms is as follows: full arm length is twenty and a half inches, upper arm is eleven and three-quarters inches, forearm (not including hand) is nine inches; leg length is thirty and three-quarters inches; hip circumference is twenty-two and a half inches; ankle is eight and a half inches; elbow is ten inches.

The average length of men's arms is: full arm length is twenty-three inches, upper arm is thirteen inches; forearm (not including hand) is ten inches; leg length is thirty-three inches; hip circumference is twenty-two inches; ankle is eight and three-quarters inches; elbow is eleven and a half inches.

### Limiting the Law of Much Talk

The natives of South Africa do not like to listen to lengthy speeches, so they have made a rule that the speaker should raise one foot, making the posture of a golden rooster standing on one leg. He can stand like this for so long, he can say so much. But once his raised foot touches the ground, his speech ends there.

### The Uselessness of Reading Theory

— Alarming Words

Recently, I often hear young students say: "The national affairs are dangerous to this point, what is the use of studying painting?" I also saw a cartoon on the wall of a certain university, drawing a few skulls on top of a painting book. Young people are already not very willing to study by habit, and now they have gained theoretical support. So they officially declared a break from books under the slogan of "patriotism first, reading is useless" and embarked on a political journey. This is the post-war phenomenon in China's education community.

According to the Yan State News Agency, Washington, the Office of Scientific Research and Development transferred a large number of scientific documents to the Library of Congress on the 23rd, which will be distributed free of charge to universities and libraries throughout the United States. These documents are the crystallization of the Office of Scientific Research and Development's great wartime research plan. It includes physics radar radio equipment, rockets, chemistry, optics, electrical transportation, underwater operations, etc. These reports will be of great benefit to scientists, educators, and industrialists in various departments. This can represent a glimpse of the dynamics of the American academic community after the war.

In contrast to these two situations, we can see that people hope to build the country with science, because to lay the foundation for building the country with science, they must universally study these scientific reports. And in our country, the gentlemen who lead the youth seem to hope to build the country with politics, because to lay the foundation for building the country with politics, they are busy directing young students to write slogans and hold demonstrations. We do not necessarily disagree with students participating in political activities, and we also know that if political affairs are not on track, all other developments will be hindered. However, we would like to ask today's youth leaders to pay attention to three things. First, please correct the idea that reading is useless and guide young people to read more books. Because behavior without knowledge is blind. Second, please pay attention to the fact that the development of young people in knowledge and ability should be multifaceted, and not just mechanically instill some political doctrine. We especially want young people to pay more attention to scientific research reports and lay a good foundation for China's industrialization. Third, when you guide young people to read, your purpose is to help them pursue the truth and not to preach to them.

Finally, I quote a passage from Gorky and dedicate it to the young people who love activities in China:

'Love books, it will make your life easier; it will friendly help you to distinguish the variety and complex confusion of thoughts, feelings and various events; it will teach you to respect others and yourself; it will use the love for the world and for humanity to put wings on your intellect and soul.

Let it oppose your beliefs, if it is sincerely written with love for mankind and the desire for people to live better, - then this is a good book'!

### On "A History of Chinese Political Thought"

— Zhao Zhen

(Volume 1) Written by Xiao Gongquan, Published by The Commercial Press

Anyone who has read Xiao Gongquan's "Political Pluralism" (Hsiao Kung-chuan: Political Pluralism A Study in Contemporary Political Theory. N.H. Harcourt London, 1927) has high expectations for Xiao Gongquan. "Political Pluralism" is an outstanding doctoral dissertation, included in the International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method series. It has been nearly twenty years since its publication. During these years, he has seemed very quiet; apart from occasionally seeing his articles in the Tsinghua Journal and the English "T'ien Hsia Monthly," we have had few opportunities to see his works. Recently, Xiao Gongquan published his new book, "A History of Chinese Political Thought," with The Commercial Press, and this is a very noteworthy book. There are already many books circulating on the market about the history of Chinese political thought, but they all have a common problem: they all stand on a narrow viewpoint, obsessing over debating the class and identity of thinkers, the idealism or materialism of doctrines, picking a sentence here, extracting a paragraph there, almost like skilled gamblers who "call a lu and it becomes a lu, shout 'pheasant' and it becomes a pheasant." As for being able to grasp the entire thought system of a thinker and create a "narrative scholarship" work that integrates and understands, that is only Xiao Gongquan's new "A History of Chinese Political Thought." Xiao's book "narrates the thoughts of various schools, striving to maintain an objective attitude, and occasionally offers commentary, intending to clarify their historical positions, daring not arbitrarily praise or denigrate, or presumptuously judge gains and losses."

The entire book is divided into five parts, totaling twenty-five chapters. Part One: Political Thought of the Feudal World—The Creative Period; Part Two: Political Thought of the Autocratic World (Part 1)—The Inherited Period; Part Three: Political Thought of the Autocratic World (Part 2)—The Transformation Period. (Above) Part Four: Political Thought of the Modern Nation (Part 1)—The Transformation Period (Below). Part Five: Political Thought of the Modern Nation (Part 2)—The Mature Period.

The author's division into these five parts is not accidental but based on principles. The author (A) divides the more than two thousand years of Chinese political thought into four major stages according to the general trend of ideological evolution: (1) The Creative Period—from Confucius to the unification of China by Qin, lasting three hundred years, commonly known as the Pre-Qin period. (2) The Inherited Period—from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Song and Yuan dynasties, lasting about one thousand six hundred years. (3) The Transformation Period—from the early Ming dynasty to the early Qing dynasty, lasting about five hundred years. (4) The Mature Period—from the establishment of the Three Principles of the People to the present. The author (B) then divides it into the following three periods according to the historical background (political history) of the emergence of thought: (1) The Thought of the Feudal World, including the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, corresponding to the aforementioned Creative Period. (2) The Thought of the Autocratic World, including the two thousand years from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Ming and Qing dynasties, corresponding to the Inherited Period and the first part of the Transformation Period. (3) The Thought of the Modern Nation, including the reform movement in the late Qing dynasty and the Xinhai Revolution to the present, corresponding to the latter part of the Green Transformation Period and the "Mature Period." Combining the two divisions of A and B, the above five parts are formed. Volume 1 of this book specifically elucidates the political thought of the Pre-Qin period.

The author believes that Chinese political thought has a common characteristic, namely, taking "the world" as the object, "the meaning of the concept of 'the world' is roughly similar to the world empire of the early Middle Ages in Europe." Ancient Chinese people lacked the international concept of coexisting states, holding the view of "political solipsism." Another characteristic is the ideal of Great Harmony, "neglecting the distinctions between races, valuing the similarities and differences in culture." As a result, for two thousand years, when China was strong, it advocated the theory of "using the Xia to transform the Yi," and when foreign races came to power, it accommodated the fact of political submission, only requiring the conquerors to practice the Chinese "Way of the Former Kings" and assimilate into us, then it would kowtow and call them subjects, acknowledging the regime of different races without any shame or resentment." This proves that Chinese people only have "cultural prejudices" and not "racial prejudices." "To sum up the above points, in one word, it is the lack of the concept of a modern nation-state. ... The so-called modern nation-state has at least the following characteristics: (1) establishing a national self-determined regime, (2) recognizing the coexistence of states and their mutual relations, (3) respecting law and emphasizing institutions, rather than relying solely on human ethics and morality for governance ... (4) expanding the people's right to participate in government can also be considered one of the characteristics of a modern nation-state. These four characteristics were completely lacking in our country during the period of autocratic rule, and even in the period of division in the feudal world [i.e., the Pre-Qin period], there were only slight traces, which were only apparent similarities. The accumulation and impact of two thousand years of political thought failed to produce the concept of a modern nation-state." What is the conclusion? It can make people reflect deeply.

The author believes that the development of political thought in the late Zhou dynasty was due to "the rapid changes in social organization and the opportune birth of great thinkers." The late Zhou dynasty was a transitional period from the feudal world to the autocratic world. In this transitional period, "the possible attitudes of political thought were no more than three: (1) expressing nostalgia for the passing old system and attempting to maintain or restore it, (2) acknowledging the status quo, or intentionally or unintentionally catering to the new trends of the future and advocating for them, (3) feeling disgusted with all new and old systems and emphasizing personal self-sufficiency and self-comfort. ... The Confucian and Mohist schools both belonged to the first category, the Legalist thinkers belonged to the second category, and Lao Zhuang of the Daoist school and all thinkers who were 'for themselves' and hermits who only cared for their own well-being all belonged to the third category. The main schools of the Pre-Qin period were the Confucian, Mohist, Daoist, and Legalist schools. In terms of their political thought, these four schools can be divided into three major factions: "One is the rule-by-man faction, to which the Confucians and Mohists belong"; "The second is the rule-by-law faction, represented by the Legalists"; "The rule-by-man and rule-by-law factions are both active political thought. Opposing these two factions with a negative attitude is the rule-by-non-action faction represented by the Daoists."

Regarding the order of the emergence of various schools of thought, the author believes that "today's lack of textual evidence makes this a very difficult task. However, there are two ways to examine the order of the Pre-Qin schools: one is the order of origin, and the other is the order of establishment." According to this statement, the problem of Lao Tzu's dating, which has been debated for a long time in Chinese intellectual history, can be easily solved. The author says: "In this book, regarding the origin of Daoist thought and the birth of Lao Dan, we temporarily follow the old saying, assuming that he was before Confucius; regarding the writing of the Lao Tzu, we follow the saying of most scholars, assuming that it was after Mencius."

The author believes that Confucius's achievement was "based on old knowledge, establishing a scholar-official's learning for advancement and practical application, and then imparting this learning to the common people, cultivating a new ruling class based on knowledge and morality." "The starting point of Confucius's political thought was following the Zhou dynasty, and the specific proposal for its implementation was 'rectifying the ruler,' which, in modern language, means rectifying names, that is, adjusting the rights and obligations of the ruler and subjects according to the system of the flourishing Zhou dynasty's enfeoffed world." "What Confucius called benevolence is to extend the love of oneself to loving others: 'Confucius's discussion of benevolence actually melts morality, ethics, and politics into one furnace, leading man, self, family, and country into one continuous thread.'" "Confucius's methods of governance are three: nourishing, cultivating, and governing." "The tools for nourishing and cultivating are 'virtue' and 'ritual,' and the tools for governing are 'administration' and 'punishment.' "Virtue and ritual are the main, and administration and punishment are the auxiliary." Confucius believed that the purpose of the state was not only to nourish the people but also to educate the people, to transform the people into customs. The methods of transforming the people into customs are (1) "setting an example" and (2) "teaching people with the Way." The author believes that "Confucius's concept of 'administration' is not only different from what modern scholars discuss but also different from the theory of Plato in ancient Greece. Those who discuss the function of politics in modern times consider it to be nothing more than governing people and governing affairs. Confucius, on the other hand, held the view that 'administration is rectification,' believing that the main task of politics is to transform people, not to govern people, let alone govern affairs. Therefore, politics and education have the same function, and the ruler and the teacher share the same job. ... Plato also regarded morality as the highest realm of the state, and his ideal of the 'philosopher-king' is also close to Confucius's advocacy of the integration of politics and education and the unity of the ruler and teacher. However, Plato's philosopher-king is an intelligent philosopher, while Confucius's ruler-teacher is a benevolent person who values virtue. The ruler-teacher transforms people with virtue, while the philosopher-king governs the country with wisdom. Their characters and skills are both different." The author believes that the characteristic of Confucian political thought is "taking education as politics" and "taking the development of individual morality as the highest ideal of politics." Therefore, although its methods of governance combine ritual and justice with penal law, it still emphasizes ritual and justice.

The author's discussions of the political thought of Mencius, Xunzi, Mozi, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Guanzi, Shang Yang, and Han Feizi also have many profound, subtle, and unique insights. Due to space limitations, we cannot introduce them to readers one by one, but from the many arguments about Confucius quoted above, one can get a glimpse of them. In our opinion, this book has the following advantages: (A) The arguments are pragmatic and rigorous—the wording of this book is extremely calm, without excessive words or exaggerated arguments. Anyone who wants to seek intellectual excitement in this book will inevitably find it plain and unremarkable and be disappointed. (B) The analysis of the principles is subtle—the author's analysis of the seemingly similar but actually different doctrines of various schools is extremely detailed. For example, the Legalist thought of the Pre-Qin period and the rule-of-law thought of modern Europe seem to be almost the same at first glance, but they are actually different. The author puts it well: "The true essence of European rule-of-law thought lies in regarding law as the highest authority in the political organization. ... Therefore, the law is higher than the power of the ruler, and the monarch is bound by the law. ... This is as opposed to our country's Pre-Qin 'rule of law' thought, which takes the ruler as the main body and the law as the tool." Another example is that the Daoist and Legalist schools also seem similar at first glance, but they are actually very different. "The key point of Huang-Lao's discussion of governance is nothing more than purity and inaction, and the Legalist thinkers also occasionally express their meaning. ... Guanzi said, 'The formless emptiness is called the Way,' and 'When names are rectified and laws are prepared, the sage has nothing to do.' All these words, if placed in the Tao Te Ching, may not seem dissimilar." However, the author believes that the differences between Daoism and Legalism are at least threefold: (1) The techniques of inaction are different. The Legalists' achievement of inaction "is to achieve the realm of 'the enlightened ruler does nothing above, and the ministers tremble below' through the methods of clarifying laws and regulations, emphasizing severe punishments, and unifying education. Their skill is precisely the third-rate politics that Lao Tzu said 'the next fear it.' ... Lao Tzu achieves inaction through laissez-faire, while Shen and Han achieve inaction through autocracy." (2) The purposes of inaction are different. "The purpose of Huang-Lao's inaction is to establish pure and peaceful governance to protect the well-being of the people; the Legalist thinkers teach the monarch to practice the art of inaction to consolidate the monarch's power and establish a foundation for the country's strength." (3) The positions of the monarchs are different. Lao Tzu's "laissez-faire and tolerance are so extreme that the monarch is equivalent to being nominally established, and power cannot be exercised. The monarchs in the thoughts of Shen and Han are autocratic monarchs on the eve of the unification by the First Emperor, concentrating power in themselves and imposing rewards and punishments on the masses. ... Therefore, the inaction (so-called by the Legalists) is 'another name for hiding punishment and concealing wisdom, and cannot be mentioned in the same breath as those who are simple-minded and confuse their hearts with the world.'" (C) There are many "footnotes"—the author's deep effort in this book can be seen from the many footnotes in each chapter. Each chapter has more than a hundred footnotes, and the chapter on Shang Yang and Han Feizi has as many as one hundred and forty-two. These footnotes either indicate the origin and source of "quoted sentences" or supplement and elaborate on what is not detailed in the text. This is rare in academic works published in China. This book has many other advantages, but the author humbly says: "The author's learning is barren, and the manuscript of this book was written during the Anti-Japanese War, so it was quite inconvenient to refer to books." In fact, this is truly a harvest in the academic community in China during the Anti-Japanese War. We hope that the remaining volumes of this book can meet us soon.

### Several Books Welcomed for Review

This publication often receives many book review manuscripts from readers, but the editors often feel that they cannot be used. The biggest reason is that the books selected for review are not of sufficient quality, and we cannot find suitable review manuscripts for the books we want to introduce. Therefore, the editors specially put forward several books to welcome reviews. Each article should be around one thousand words.

### "A Study of Currency and Prices"

— Zhang Zhensheng

Written by Jiang Tingfu, Sold by the Author's Bookstore

It has been ten months since the victory, but the suffering of the people remains the same. Prices in various places continue to rise, leading to waves of strikes and slowdowns. In addition, foreign goods are coming in continuously, and all manufacturing factories have reached an extremely dangerous state. The reasons for all of this are certainly not just one, but apart from the political situation, it is the problem of currency and prices. Therefore, there has been a lot of discussion about currency and prices recently, but most of them are limited to temporary and local works, or about foreign exchange, or about price indexes, or describing the price situation in one place, etc. There are still no works on the entire issue of currency and prices. Mr. Jiang's writing of this book is indeed very suitable for the current needs.

The entire book is divided into eight chapters, including (1) Introduction to Currency, (2) Introduction to Prices, (3) Credit and Currency, (4) The Value of Currency, (5) Reasons for Price Fluctuations, (6) The Quantity Theory of Money, (7) The Impact of Price Fluctuations and Price Policy, (8) An Overview of Modern Price Fluctuations in China. In the first two chapters, currency and prices are analyzed and explained in detail, so that those who study currency and prices can first clearly understand the problem. Then, in Chapters 3 and 4, the evolution of currency and the various relationships that occur with price issues are studied. Chapters 5 and 6 then study the causes of price fluctuations, elaborating on various theories in detail, and then referring to the facts to establish a new theory, namely, the trade quantity theory created by Mr. Jiang in this book. Chapter 7 analyzes and explains in detail the advantages and disadvantages of price fluctuations and what kind of price policy should be applied. Finally, Chapter 8 comprehensively describes the price fluctuations in China over the years and provides evidence. The entire article is logically coherent and clearly structured, with both academic theory and facts being studied, providing a very good introductory book for those who have not studied currency and prices.

Examining the theories of various countries on currency and prices up to the most recent time, the quantity theory of money is the most famous. Although this theory has various shortcomings, there is still no more accurate knowledge that can overthrow and replace it. Now, Mr. Jiang overthrows this theory in this book and creates the trade quantity theory to replace it. Mr. Jiang said: "Goods existed long before currency was invented, but in the past, goods were not exchanged through currency, so there was no price problem. In the future, with the progress of world science, modern currency may be completely abolished in the future and replaced by other methods, which is also unknown. If that time comes, then prices will naturally not be a problem. But the need for goods is indispensable to human life. No matter how advanced science is, the need for goods will only increase their types and become more complex, and it is impossible to break the need for goods and maintain life. Therefore, the importance of the price problem lies in goods, not money or currency. ... Currency is just a means to be used as a medium of exchange." He also said: "Currency has undergone many changes, and recently coins have tended to be eliminated, and various transactions are mostly exchanged for credit currency and goods. ... Therefore, in the modern price problem, currency has gradually lost its importance, and the important factors that have become the price problem, in addition to goods, are transactions. No matter what form of transaction is used, if there is no transaction, there is no price problem. However, although various transactions do not all use currency for exchange, the quantity of currency is still used as the standard measure for exchange calculation. Therefore, the basic elements of the price problem, in addition to goods, are the quantity of trade." This theory does have unique insights. Mr. Jiang also believes that the velocity of money can only be applied to the era of coins, and in the era of credit currency, the velocity of goods circulation is often used instead. This statement is also quite accurate. Furthermore, Mr. Jiang has arranged the formula for the trade quantity theory according to theory and facts as:

QPC=E

Therefore, Mr. Jiang not only introduces many theories of currency and prices in this book, but also develops what predecessors have not developed, and overthrows the residual quantity theory of the British scholar Keynes and the transaction quantity theory of the American scholar Fisher, and establishes a new theory to replace them. Therefore, this book is an extremely good book for those who have already studied the problem of currency and prices to increase their research materials.

This book is detailed in its description of facts and clear in its analysis. In the first chapter, the evolution of currency is described in detail, concisely and comprehensively, for both China and other countries. In the second chapter, the meaning, function, and calculation methods of the price index are explained one by one in great detail, so that readers can immediately understand the function and calculation of the index. In the sixth chapter, the origin of the quantity theory of money and the various theories of currency by scholars from various countries over the years are described in detail, so that one can understand the evolution of currency theory in various countries around the world. In the eighth chapter, the price fluctuations and their causes in our country since the Republic of China are divided into two periods, the first period from the first year of the Republic of China to the twenty-fourth year, and the second period from the twenty-fifth year to the present, with each period described in detail and accompanied by various extremely valuable index tables. Therefore, this book is also a rare reference book for those who generally study the problem of currency and prices.

### Review of "Frosty Leaves Red as February Flowers"

— Yao Jun

Mr. Mao Dun's voluminous work "Frosty Leaves Red as February Flowers," which is approximately 1.5 million words in length, has had its first part, approximately 150,000 words, published by Huahua Bookstore. It uses the decade of the Republic of China, the May Fourth era, as its backdrop, providing a detailed description of the society at that time. The old society was shaken by the impact of the currents of the times and had begun to waver, but the reactionary forces were putting up a strong struggle, reflecting the twilight years, and these frosty leaves were as red as spring flowers.

Mr. Mao Dun set this story in a small county near a city, which can eliminate superficial things and allow people to see the situation of Chinese society at that time more clearly, and also make the theme more prominent.

Here, there is a conflict between the old landlord class and the new capitalist class, with scheming, backstabbing, and open and secret attacks; here, there is the confusion and distress of the more righteous intellectual youth. The author strings these together, interweaves them, and writes a moving epic.

The representative of the old landlord class is Zhao Shouyi and his group, who have seized the savings of the charitable hall for more than ten years and are unwilling to publish the accounts. Their opponent, the representative of the new capitalist class, Wang Boshen and his group, are using the excuse of running a poor people's apprenticeship to force him to spit out the fat meat he has eaten. However, Zhao Shouyi immediately launches a counterattack, alleging that the ships of Wang Boshen's shipping company are running in shallow inland rivers, causing the river water to constantly destroy the people's fields on the banks. Zhao Shouyi then sends his henchmen Xu Shixiu and Cao Zhicheng to instigate farmers to attack the ships. Wang Bozong uses the police to suppress them, killing a village child. This matter is ignited, but they reconcile. The capital on one side is the loss of the villagers and the life of a child, and the capital on the other side is the public accumulation of the charitable hall, public property, and the losses are still suffered by the common people.

The intellectual youth who are confused and distressed are first and foremost Zhang Fu's young master Xunru. His family arranged for him to marry the current young mistress, but he is enamored of his cousin Xu Jingxin. He always wants to go out and do something, but his grandmother wants him to stay at home and guard the family business; he is dissatisfied with the status quo, but he cannot change the current environment. The second is Xunru's brother-in-law Huang Heguang, who has enough family wealth to live comfortably for the rest of his life, and a beautiful and talented wife, but due to his physical defects, he cannot fully fulfill his duties as a husband, let alone carry on the family line, and has therefore become addicted to opium, leaving him listless, and he is unwilling to ruin his life in this way. The third is Xunru's cousin Qian Liangcai. Among these three protagonists, he is the most promising. He has passion and courage, and wholeheartedly wants to do something for the local area, willing to sacrifice his own interests. When the ships constantly destroy the fields, he opposes Cao Zhicheng's instigation of the villagers to attack the ships and teaches the farmers in the village to shrink the land and build embankments, sacrificing a small number of low-lying fields to protect the interests of the majority, and the losses are shared by everyone. He does this with the belief that it is "beneficial to everyone," but when he understands that everyone is unwilling but obedient to him, his confidence is shattered again. In the power struggle between Zhao Shouyi and Wang Boshen, he also emerges to try to exchange a small human life for a local public service, but in the end, he becomes a difficult person, and those who take advantage are still Zhao Shouyi and Wang Boshen. His confusion and distress are deeper than those of Xunru and Heguang.

Why did the reform movement at that time accomplish nothing? Zhu Xingjian, a gentleman who was out of touch with the times in the book, said: "... We learn from others' electrical lighting, and it still looks somewhat like it, but when we learn about laws and regulations, it is completely inconsistent, why is this? ..."

Why is this? Huang Heguang said: "I think there are too many people in the world who are neither good nor bad, but can be good or bad, which is why they allow bad people to act recklessly?"

"Why does a person become someone who can be good or bad? ... If he doesn't know what is good and what is bad, but why can everyone say what is good and what is bad? Since they can say it, why can't they do it?" Qian Liangcai asked: "You, me, the three of us, do we count as a group that can be good or bad? If we are also capable of being good or bad, have we ever thought about what is the reason?"

At that time, Zhu Xingjian, Qian Liangcai, and others could only understand this point. Mr. Mao Dun did not go further in preaching here, but left this question behind.

Frosty leaves are red as February flowers, and even now, aren't they still so red? More than twenty years have passed since that era, and do we still have the same views on this issue as Qian Liangcai and the others did at that time!

I feel that Mr. Mao Dun's novels absorb and melt the advantages of old Chinese novels. For example, in this "Frosty Leaves Red as February Flowers," the arrangement of the story begins with Rui Gu's wife returning to Zhang's residence and chatting with the old lady as an introduction, narrating the family history of the characters who appear, and then using the movement of the characters to bring the story to another occasion, developing layer by layer, and finally using Wan Xiaojie adopting a stepdaughter as a conclusion, which is coherent and not far-fetched. Also, in terms of character handling, he uses frontal descriptions, side衬托 from the mouths of other characters, and the protagonist's own dialogues, debates, and analyses to make each character's personality and character very vivid and prominent. These are all things we often see in old novels. There are many such examples in this book, but due to space limitations, I cannot list them in detail here.

Mr. Mao Dun's style is characterized by plain drawing, which is clear, stable, and meticulous, developing layer by layer, without any far-fetchedness or deliberate shock value, but rather profound and realistic. This style is not easy for inattentive readers to appreciate, and as a result, they feel a bit dull.

Mr. Wu Zuxiang's review of "Frosty Leaves Red as February Flowers" is a bit "cultural," which refers to the many debates and analyses in the book, but these can be used to express the characters' thoughts and personalities, which is a strength of old novels. As long as it does not fall into the cliché of psychological description, this technique can be adopted.

### Record of Ding Xilin

Shortly after the May Fourth Movement, I saw several early popular comedies and farces, which were simple and easy to understand. Suddenly, seeing Ding Xilin's "A Wasp," I felt it stood out from its peers, a breath of fresh air. It gave us an unusual feeling of novelty. This collection is a compilation of several one-act plays, in which the dialogue is beautiful, humorous, and speaks in riddles. Not only is it not annoying, but it is also pleasing. Many witty phrases, only he could think of. Among them, "Oppression" is the most popular, and I don't know how many theater troupes have performed it. I once took his "Peking Air" and selected it for my "Junior High School Mixed Mandarin Textbook" as an example of rhetoric and style, because this article says good things about servants everywhere, but in fact, it says bad things about servants everywhere.

In order to commemorate the May Fourth Literary and Art Festival, the All-China Literary and Art Association decided to invite this May Fourth era writer to give a speech and perform his "Oppression." In this time of housing shortage in Shanghai, it is also very meaningful to replay this play. The day before yesterday, I made a special trip to the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica to see him, to arrange things in advance. It was drizzling at this time, and although I felt a little inconvenient, I went with an excited heart. Finally, I saw him walking leisurely into a reception room. He already had a lot of white hair on his head, and his kind smile gave people the feeling of a kind mother. I instantly became a child, bathed in the warm radiance. He told me that he would go to Nanjing on the day of the Literary and Art Festival, and the Academia Sinica was building an observatory there, so he had to go and see it. Although he was not invited, and later "Oppression" was not performed, I was still happy to have the opportunity to see the writer I admired. I still walked out of that garden of moist trees in the drizzling rain.

It was also a drizzling day, at night, I put on my raincoat and went to the Carlton to see the performance of Ding Xilin's new work, "When Madam Returns." Coincidentally, Xilin was sitting in the row in front of me, watching attentively the creation he had cultivated himself. First, a short play, "Three Dollars National Currency," was performed. Both of these plays write about servants, but they are different from "Peking Air." The former describes a young master and young lady pulling a maid to sit down and have tea together, and the maid sits down uneasily after being modest. The latter describes a university student who, dissatisfied with a mistress firing a maid, vents his anger by breaking another vase and compensating her with three dollars in national currency, because this was the price she set for the maid to compensate for breaking the vase. Both of these points illustrate what kind of person the author is, sympathizing with the plight of the maid.

"When Madam Returns" tells the story of a father who is a traitor, and his eldest daughter and son-in-law agree with him, but his wife, son, and youngest daughter object to this matter. The result is the departure of the three objectors. The son packed his luggage one morning, preparing to leave without his mother's knowledge. Unexpectedly, the mother came downstairs and said to him that the sound of packing luggage could wake anyone up, and also told him that she had bought three boat tickets, and she and her youngest sister would go with him. Before leaving, she lied to the eldest daughter, saying that she was escorting her son to retrieve the luggage, and also gave the maid a lot of money. The maid was baffled and asked the eldest lady, who told her to ask the madam "when Madam returns."

This play was written in the third year of the War of Resistance. If the environment had allowed it to be performed at that time, it would have aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience. National righteousness should always be promoted, but the era and demands of the current audience are different. Shallow as I am, I don't quite understand "Miaofeng Mountain," just like I don't understand Cao Yu's "Peking Man," but I like "Miaofeng Mountain." It contains the consistent style of the "Xilin One-Act Play Collection." The whimsical events and dialogues gave me a novel stimulus. The style of these two dramas is different from before. It seems that they have changed from gorgeous to plain, or rather, they are closer to realism, easy to understand, and approachable. Probably Mr. Ding felt the great push of the War of Resistance, heard and witnessed many moving events, and wrote this righteous drama with justice. At this time, he had no time to take care of his skills. He didn't want to use those little tricks anymore. He only felt a surging force urging him to write, and he wrote it down in one breath. When the play was about to be finished, he breathed a sigh of relief, and then he remembered the "Xilin style," so he gave us an unusual ending at the end.

After the play was over, Liang Lin stood up and buttoned his wife's raincoat. I shook hands with him to say goodbye, and took the opportunity to ask him a few questions about the script. He was quite bewildered, perhaps afraid that people would discover or notice who he was. This shows his humility. He is not the Oscar Wilde who wears lilies in his chest and swaggered through the market.

### Wild Cat (Novel)

— Chi Zhao

These days, after school, when I bring the three children home from school, Lan'er, who is only five years old and not yet in school, always has a lot of news to tell us. He pouts his little mouth and waves his little hands, saying:

"This morning, the mom downstairs bought two chicks!"

"Loquats cost seven hundred dollars a catty, and Auntie Ji in the front building bought a big basket!"

"Ah Ye ate two zongzi at noon today!"

"..."

His conclusion every time is: "Dad, let's buy them too!" At that time, his index finger was always in his little mouth, showing a gluttonous look.

Lan'er's words are of the greatest interest to his third and second brothers, and they listen to them the most attentively, but whenever Lan'er says, "Dad, let's buy them too!" the eldest brother always pulls his little hand and disturbs him, saying, "Tell your brother!"

Looking at the situation on the road and in the neighbors' homes, I also know that the Dragon Boat Festival is coming soon, but... when I think of that problem, I am always silent in the face of the children's innocent demands. Ren'er Xin is a twelve-year-old child, and growing up in a poor environment has created his melancholy character. Perhaps because he is older than his three younger brothers, he also seems to understand more about human relationships and the world. He is often the eighth one in the family to solve problems and disputes. However, whenever I think of the "precocious" character of the eldest son formed by suffering, I feel sorry for him.

It was the day before the Dragon Boat Festival, and it was late at night. My wife inspected the sleeping state of the four children. She breathed a sigh of relief and lay on the bed. At that time, I had finished grading the papers. She said:

"The day after tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival. These days, the children see people buying things to eat, and they stare at them longingly. It's quite pitiful. We should also buy some to celebrate the occasion."

"Hmm!" I was thinking.

"The second landlord downstairs bought a dou of glutinous rice and wrapped more than a hundred zongzi. The front building also bought five sheng. Other things like chickens and loquats have been bought. We should also buy two sheng of glutinous rice and two catties of loquats. Although we can't afford chicken, we should also buy two catties of fish and meat. And the children haven't eaten meat for a month or two. We should make them happy during the holidays. It's pitiful to just watch other people eat." My wife continued to say a lot.

Speaking of the children's pitifulness, what father doesn't understand the truth. And my family's four children, because they are usually accustomed to a situation where not every request is granted, are especially obedient. What they say and what they eat all follow their parents' instructions. They never cry or stomp their feet to ask for food or play. However, when I think that celebrating a festival like my wife said will cost the price of two dou of rice, and two dou of rice can support a family of six for ten days of congee and rice, I hesitated. I was even more silent. I thought that I was a poor teacher from a fallen scholar-official class. I only have tens of thousands of yuan in tuition fees per month, and I can't even support a month's living expenses, so where does this extra expense come from?

"You, what do you mean?" My wife urged me for an answer, as if impatient with the silence.

I sighed, got up, picked up a cigarette and smoked it. The sleeping postures of the four children came into view. I walked up to their bed and gently stroked them—their malnourished faces and limbs. I finally agreed to my wife's suggestion and said that the cost should not exceed 10,000 yuan.

Under the light, I saw a blush on my wife's overworked, thin, and sallow face, and her tightly furrowed brows also relaxed. She also said excitedly, as if forgetting a day's fatigue:

"When the festival comes, fish and meat will definitely be more expensive than usual. It's better to buy them tomorrow morning and cook them well, waiting to eat them on the day of the festival."

The next day, when the children got up, my wife told them what she was going to buy today. The youngest three children all clapped their little hands, but the eldest son was still unmoved, urging them to wash up. Lan'er didn't even wipe his face. He hurried out of the room to tell his little companion in the same room:

"We are buying fish, buying meat, buying loquats, and wrapping zongzi today." He said, with saliva splattering everywhere.

"What about the chicks? Are you buying them or not? We have chicks." The little girl downstairs asked him.

Lan'er hurried back, pulled on his wife's clothes, and said:

"Mom, are we buying chicks or not?" He waited with wide eyes for an answer.

"Buy, buy, we'll buy everything!" Before his wife could answer, the eldest son said angrily.

"Buy, buy, we'll buy everything!" Lan'er also grabbed the railing and said to the little girl downstairs.

When I came home from school, my wife had already wrapped the zongzi, simmered two bowls of braised pork, and there was also a section of salted fish. Needless to say, the loquats were also bought.

The braised pork was so cute, simmered in soy sauce until it was golden and shiny, each piece like a "mahjong tile," and a strong aroma aroused several pairs of little eyes to blink and twinkle at it.

It was time for dinner, and because the children couldn't forget it, they were only allowed to eat two pieces of braised pork first. Little faces were full of smiles, and Lan'er and the others only sucked on the meat and sent it to their rice, reluctant to swallow it.

"Today, the price of meat is 2,500 yuan per catty. It's worth more than a hundred dollars a piece. You guys taste it carefully." My wife said, and also revealed a proud smile. The eldest son stuck out his tongue.

"Last year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, when we used counterfeit money, it was only 1,500 yuan per catty. This year, it's up another thousand. In recent days, the price of all kinds of vegetables has gone up. It's difficult to eat even vegetable roots!" My wife said with emotion again.

After dinner, after washing and changing the children, my wife considered the problem of storing the fish and meat, because the weather was hot. If they were placed in the cupboard, they might rot, which would be a pity, so the result was to decide to put them on the table by the window, which was the most suitable place for ventilation.

The children were thinking about having good things to eat when they woke up the next day, and they were already sound asleep. My wife was busy all day, and she also seemed to have completed a major task today, and she was also fast asleep. I also seemed to have fulfilled my most basic responsibility, and I also slept peacefully, only being awakened once by the noisy cats fighting on the roof. I pushed my wife who was sleeping next to me, but she was as if she didn't know anything.

On the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival, when I hadn't woken up yet, I was awakened by the voices of my wife and children. I felt as if something had gone wrong.

"What's wrong? Why are you arguing so early in the morning?" I asked.

"Dad, Dad, the meat and fish were stolen by a wild cat," the children shouted.

"Mom put the fish and meat on the table last night, and the cat ate them all!" The eldest son also said with a complaining tone.

I got out of bed and saw that my wife was looking frustrated, and her eyes were much brighter. The section of salted fish that I was looking forward to was gone, and half of each of the two bowls of meat was gone. I couldn't help but be stunned.

"Eating so much, it must have been eaten by more than one dead cat." My wife muttered. "It's almost half of 2,500 yuan per catty that was eaten, and that section of fish also cost 2,500 yuan." My wife sighed.

I wanted to say that I had heard the cats fighting last night, but I was afraid that my wife and children would blame me, so I had to change my tone and comfort them, saying:

"It's okay, it's okay, it only ate half of it."

Afterwards, my wife and I discussed. She said that this matter could not be publicized to the co-residents and neighbors, because if the fish and meat were eaten by cats, it would be easy to just buy some more, but where could we afford to buy them again? If we didn't buy them, wouldn't we be laughed at? So it's better not to let people know about this matter and just tighten our stomachs and pretend to be decent. The three older children were still sensible, but they were afraid that Lan'er would let it slip, so my wife was scaring Lan'er, saying that he was not allowed to tell anyone about this kind of thing. In Lan'er's little heart, it was as if something big had happened at home, and he was only depressed all day long, and he didn't say anything to anyone.

Although I didn't agree with my wife's suggestion, I thought that I couldn't live alone, and I sympathized with my wife's situation, so I didn't say anything. It was only pitiful that the children were also taught to lie by my wife.

That day, we closed the door and ate dinner. My wife and I only listened silently to the sound of the neighbors and co-residents drinking and playing finger-guessing games. The children were still happy, because there was still meat left for the wild cat to eat, and there were loquats to eat, and there were...

### Letter

— Ren Quan

Friend!

Although it's only been a day, it feels like a century!

From the time we shook hands and said goodbye in front of the ×× Hall this morning, until now when I'm writing this at home under the quiet lamp, I feel like I've had a bewildered dream. It seems vague, but it is indeed real. Although it is real, it is as light and distant as a dream. Even though I know that this is an unavoidable fact that must be faced, I still like to savor it like reminiscing about a dream. Now I've come to a conclusion—I'm sitting alone under the lamp writing a letter, just like when we wrote a letter of peace to our parents on the first night we entered the dormitory a few years ago.

Did you sleep well last night? I was afraid you'd catch a cold. Although everyone forgot about the cold because of excitement, the night wind was carrying the autumn air. "The stars are not as they were last night, for whom do I stand in the wind and dew?" But who could give up this last night of reunion at our alma mater? Heaven also seemed to have specially arranged for us the most beautiful and moving night. The moon, which hadn't been seen for days, finally showed its face last night. And it also brought us the most caressing and gentle illumination, allowing us to bathe in its loving light, to make noise as we pleased, and to laugh to our hearts' content. The city sounds all around were dead silent. Only the wind sighed in the treetops. Our young laughter overflowed in the embrace of our alma mater, and it will echo forever. On every night of June 15th, it will become an eternal echo for a long time to come.

Finally, we saw a lunar eclipse again; this was a novel experience for many of us. But it was a coincidence that we saw this celestial phenomenon last night. When we watched the full moon being swallowed by the shadow, we all felt黯然. Is it going to be missing again so quickly? It made us think of the parting that was about to happen to us. We also shed tears sadly; for the friendship from the time we braided our pigtails until we graduated together, we shed tears at this beautiful universe. The bright tears will coalesce and illuminate the many, many days that await us. I used to have this sentence: "A man's tears are only shed for the mountains and rivers." Tonight, I feel that these tears are also worth shedding.

The stars moved, and we were still talking and laughing. Beautiful futures floated before everyone's eyes. In the highest and most beautiful hope, we established our confidence. Why can't we make tonight the most meaningful night in our future memories? Silently, we all made vows to take on the work of making this world a better place. Now we feel the existence of the great and the small. Although some of us have some very small grievances, from now on, I believe, they should all be gently released from the silent mutual understanding.

In a person's life, there are many serious and beautiful responsibilities; these responsibilities are unconsciously shouldered by us and unconsciously completed by us. Before, when we entered school, we didn't understand anything, and we only knew how to run and jump, laugh and make noise. However, unintentionally and invisibly, we have shouldered a serious and beautiful responsibility. We are for learning, for enriching ourselves, and for educating ourselves. Now a stage can be declared complete. The classmates who have been together for several years during the occupied period are about to part ways. Unconsciously, we have shouldered another serious and beautiful responsibility, which is mutual love and friendship. If we can be competent, we will complete one of the most valuable tasks in the universe. If countless people besides us can be competent, this world will become a more suitable place for humans to live.

Last night, I didn't sleep well at all. In the deep of night, I seemed to hear someone sobbing quietly. I was so annoyed that I had to repeatedly recite the verses in "Cherishing the Past" until I fell asleep drowsily. The night was too short.

Friend, we should always be together.

### Scribbles from the Sculpture Studio (II)

— Liu Shi

Types of Sculpture

There are many types of sculpture based on the material used—wood carving, stone carving, clay sculpture, terracotta, dry lacquer, bronze casting, ivory carving, iron pen carving, etc.

Wood carving and modeling are more common in the Orient than in the West, and the techniques are unique and tasteful, and the history is also long. In the Western method of wood carving, a clay model must first be sculpted, and then the clay model is turned into plaster, and then carved according to the model (the same is true for the stone carving production process). The Orient is different. For example, the wood-carved Buddhist statues in various temples and ancestral halls are mostly carved out of a whole piece of wood. Sometimes hands and feet are added separately. Although their shapes are not as realistic as those in the West, their simple, dignified, and solemn expressions are far beyond the reach of Western works. Modeling in the Orient, especially in China, also has an ancient method of using hemp cloth and lacquer. As far back as the Buddhist statues sculpted by Yang Hui of the Tang Dynasty in Jiaozhi, Suzhou, they are still as complete as new after nearly a thousand years. This is also something that Westerners cannot dream of, because modeling in the West is only used as a practice or a model for bronze casting, stone carving, and wood carving. The wood used for wood carving can be camphor, cypress, cherry, osmanthus, magnolia, or boxwood. In our country, ordinary devout men and women seek holiness and piety when carving Buddhist statues, and sometimes use sandalwood, but the number is very small. Camphor is not easily infested by insects, boxwood is easy to carve, cherry wood has beautiful patterns, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The authors also have their own preferences. In the Western Middle Ages, wood carvings were mostly used for temple decoration, and there are also many modern writers who are good at wood carving. Maillol can be regarded as one with a stronger interest. P. Gauguin also made many wood carvings in the style of natives in Tahiti, which were quite interesting.

Stone carvings were very common in ancient Egypt and Greece in the West. They mostly used white marble produced in Carrara, Italy, which has a fine, delicate, and lustrous texture, and the sculptures made from it are extremely beautiful. Modern writers have also made many of them, and Rodin also likes to use it. Stone carving was also popular in ancient China, but it gradually declined after the Song Dynasty. Although some people still advocated it in the Ming Dynasty, the number was very small. The stone figures and beasts in front of the Ming Mausoleum in Jinling, which still exist today, differ from those of the Tang Dynasty because they were influenced by Hungary.

Dry lacquer carving is made by mixing clay and sawdust with raw lacquer. The Jigong statue in Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou uses this method. It does not crack after many years and is extremely durable. In recent years, it has been adopted by the Japanese, but the Chinese do not pay attention to it.

Bronze casting, whether in the East or the West, was extremely prosperous in ancient times. Its production is as described above. A clay model must first be sculpted, then turned into plaster, then turned into a sand mold, and then molten metal is poured into it to form the final product. Gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead can all be used for it. Generally, bronze is more common, and the production process is very complicated.

Ivory carving was mostly used to carve statues of the Virgin Mary in the Western Middle Ages, and was also often used to carve statues of Guanyin in China during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Western and Chinese art resonated with each other in an invisible way.

Iron pen carving, because its carving knife is like a pen, is used to carve bamboo utensils. Many Orientals are good at this technique, and their interest is also stronger, perhaps because bamboo is produced there.

Terracotta is a type of sculpture made of clay and fired in a kiln. It has been quite popular in the West in recent years. Yixing in China also has it, but they are all made by craftsmen, so the taste is low.

Classifying sculpture by technique, there are three-dimensional carving, relief carving, intaglio carving, and line carving. Ordinary sculptures that can be viewed from all sides are called three-dimensional carvings. Relief carving and intaglio carving are a kind of product that mixes sculpture and painting. Like painting, it can only be viewed from one side. The difference is that in addition to giving people visual appreciation, it also has a sense of touch. Line carving, it is much better to say that it is painting than that it is sculpture, because it only uses different tools.

### Views on Love

— Yun

Zhongyuan Jun wrote a piece called "Mother" in the Chunqiu column of this newspaper. When I read it, it seemed that the words were filled with tears of extreme affection. When I finished speaking the last sentence, I felt a burst of unbearable sadness in my heart, and tears followed down. Of course! I also have the same maternal love as Zhongyuan Jun, but my mother has also left this world. However, I don't have the wonderful writing skills to describe it as vividly and movingly as Zhongyuan Jun. My view on love is that any kind of love in mankind cannot compare to the greatness of maternal love. Since ancient times, mothers have loved their children, and it can be said that there is nothing they will not do. True love is revealed, and everything is overwhelmed. Anyone can experience this, but there are few children in the world who love their mothers, and some even hate their mothers. Daughters are more obedient and considerate in comparison. You should know that if you don't love your mother, your children may not treat your wife as a mother in the future. Therefore, in a family, we must first transfer the love for our wives to the love for our mothers, first to repay them, which is only right and proper. Secondly, set an example, first for the wife to see, and then for the children to learn, isn't that right?

Between men and women, only the word "private" can be said. "Private" is a subjective view, not pure, and without true affection. To put it bluntly, it cannot escape mutual exploitation. There is no talk of affection, let alone love, so maternal love is the true and supreme love of mankind.

I hope that texts like "Mother" written by Zhongyuan Jun will be published more in the newspaper, so that those who do not understand the true meaning of maternal love can shift their vision on their views on love.

### Two Birds Flying Together (66)

— Zhao Qingge

Madam Mo couldn't help but console Second Madam Weng for a while. Fortunately, her own mood wasn't infected; she was still happy with the anticipation of infinite hope. She didn't fully understand what Shi Yulou had said earlier, nor did she need to. The only thing she cared about now was tomorrow's glory. She imagined that after Lihua went on stage tomorrow, the entire theater audience would applaud and cheer for Lihua. Then, the theater manager would give her a thumbs up and ask to sign a contract with her. From then on, Lihua would become the star of this theater; from then on, she could receive a fixed "salary" every month (the fixed remuneration for actors); from then on, her life would be carefree! Thinking of this, she couldn't help but smile as she prepared Lihua's new clothes for the New Year. She then brought Lihua before her and affectionately stroked her, saying:

"Xiaohua, you'll be ten years old tomorrow, and tomorrow is your first time on stage! Don't let Mom down! Sing well and perform attentively. In three days, your teacher said you can officially 'enter the sea' [begin a professional singing career]. In the future, when you earn money, Mom will let you eat well, dress well, and enjoy a lifetime of happiness."

Lihua didn't say a word, as if she hadn't heard Madam Mo's words.

"Child, don't be shy when you're on stage. With your teacher playing the huqin for you, just be like you're at home. Sing as you should sing, and perform as you should perform. Don't panic or be afraid at all," Madam Mo earnestly urged again.

Lihua remained silent as before, staring at the ceiling with an indifferent expression on her face.

Seeing that Lihua didn't speak, Madam Mo thought she was sleepy, so she urged her to go to bed.

"Go to sleep early and get up early tomorrow to wear your new clothes!" Madam Mo said.

Only then did Lihua "hum" and walk away.

In fact, Lihua wasn't sleepy at all; her mind was filled with chaotic thoughts. But she didn't feel particularly sad; she just felt strange! Strange that Madam Mo didn't use other methods to make her "earn money." She knew there were many ways to earn money, such as working as a servant for others; she could sweep the floor, wash dishes, and take care of children. She didn't think these were hardships. She could also go to a tailor shop to sew clothes and do rough needlework for people. She saw many young girls working there in the tailor shop. But Madam Mo refused to do that!! She only chose the path of earning money through singing! Shi Yulou had even said earlier that singing was to "relieve boredom" for people, which was clearly not a good thing. Even Shi Yulou resented this profession, but Madam Mo wanted her to do it. What's the logic? She didn't understand! But she didn't want to disobey Madam Mo. She had been beaten and suffered. Now that she had learned this profession, she could only do it! As for the matter of going on stage tomorrow, she only felt a sense of blankness. She remembered seeing Shi Yulou singing on stage; she and many other people were staring at Shi Yulou from the audience, and Shi Yulou seemed not to see them, just singing his songs. So, tomorrow she would also sing on stage, letting many people stare at her from the audience. Would she be shy? But even if she was shy, she had to sing! So she decided that she could only learn from Shi Yulou, pretending not to see so many people, and just sing her part.

"Singing is clearly something to make people happy, but that bad sister mistakenly took singing as a 'toy'!"

Lihua said to herself. She understood this awareness, and she couldn't help but laugh at Lihua's childishness in treating singing as a toy.
