### Harmonious Atmosphere at Shanghai Talks; Preliminary Understanding Reached; CCP Statement Does Not Affect Negotiations

[Report from this newspaper] Government and Political Consultative Conference representatives yesterday exchanged opinions for the first time with representatives from the CCP, Democratic League, Youth Party, and various prominent figures. The atmosphere was extremely harmonious, and the door to negotiations has already been opened. All parties expressed a willingness to discuss matters. After the broadcast from Yan'an was released, the representatives also reviewed it. They all agreed that both sides were seeking a ceasefire and restoration of peace, with essentially no difference in spirit. Even if there are differences, they are not significant. Furthermore, Yan'an's request to restore the military deployment as of January 13th can, in fact, be seen as a form of "counter-offer." Making a request is fundamentally different from a complete breakdown. According to what this reporter knows, yesterday's meeting yielded results that are quite reassuring to the nation. Among the government's eight proposals, three or four have already achieved preliminary understanding.

Yesterday morning, third-party representatives Zhang Junmai, Hu Zhengzhi, Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Yang Yongjun, Yu Jiaju, and others exchanged opinions with the three government representatives at Wu Tiecheng's residence on Haige Road. At noon, the third-party representatives hosted a banquet for the government and CCP representatives at Fan Garden, with Zhou Enlai, Li Weihan, and Chen Jiakang attending. At 5:00 PM, government representatives, along with representatives from various parties and factions, and prominent figures, all went to Zhou Enlai's residence on Sinan Road to continue the talks. At 7:30 PM, the government representatives hosted a banquet for all the representatives, again at Wu's residence.

During the exchange of opinions yesterday, the CCP reiterated the views broadcast from Yan'an. It was heard that a certain government representative, because the CCP was requesting the restoration of the military situation as of January 13th, said with a smile, "Then will you withdraw from the Northeast region?" However, as one representative present said, after months of separation, once reunited, they felt very close. Thus, the atmosphere at the meeting was filled with laughter and lively interest.

The CCP then presented "suggestions" regarding the method of negotiation (the CCP representative stated that this was merely a "suggestion" and not a "demand"). The CCP stated that there were three methods: (1) "Stop talking," which means first a ceasefire, then negotiations; (2) "Negotiate a ceasefire," which means first conducting preliminary discussions to discuss ceasefire measures, then a ceasefire, and then discussing other issues after the ceasefire; (3) "Negotiate and cease," which means first reaching an agreement and then a ceasefire. At the time, the representatives all felt that "stop talking" was practically impossible. "Negotiate and cease" would take too long. Thus, "negotiate a ceasefire" was the most appropriate. And once this "negotiate a ceasefire" approach is adopted, the first "negotiate" word should be kept relatively simple, with the time required as short as possible, so that the ceasefire can be achieved as soon as possible, and other details can be discussed after the ceasefire.

Lei Zhen Returns to Nanjing Tonight to Report on the Talks

However, regarding the scope of this first "negotiate" part, the opinions of the various parties differed slightly. Therefore, Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei will first study the content of these negotiations.

As for the views expressed by the government during yesterday's meeting, the government said that they came to specially invite the CCP and third-party representatives to Nanjing for negotiations. It is okay to exchange opinions in Shanghai first, but not as formal negotiations.

However, according to this reporter, the first part of "negotiate a ceasefire," the "negotiate" part, may begin in Shanghai immediately.

This morning, the representatives exchanged opinions freely, without any meetings. At noon, the Youth Party will host a banquet for the representatives. At 4:00 PM, the Democratic Socialist Party will hold a reception tea. At 5:00 PM, there will be a meeting at Lu's residence. In the evening, the CCP will host a banquet for the representatives.

Based on general observations, during yesterday's meeting, the representatives did not seem to view the broadcast from Yan'an with extreme tension. This is because the CCP had previously announced that if the National Army attacked Zhangjiakou, the CCP would consider it a complete split. However, yesterday Yan'an still made demands and did not declare a complete breakdown. Also, Lei Zhen may return to Nanjing tonight to report on the talks of the past two days.

According to Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, he said to the reporter that there are still military conflicts in various places. To have peace, there must be a ceasefire. To have a ceasefire with effective guarantees that it will not repeat past mistakes, there must be negotiations on effective ceasefire measures. Only then can comprehensive and lasting peace be achieved.

### Intermediate Figures in Nanjing Hope Both Sides Will Stop Setting Conditions

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The political center of gravity has recently shifted from Nanjing to Shanghai. Ambassador Stuart has also left Nanjing today. Therefore, apart from the activities of a few members of the Democratic League and social figures, there has been very little contact here. At 10:00 AM on the 18th, Mo Dehui, Miao Jiaming, and Qian Xinzhi visited Liang Shuming together. Communist Party member Wang Bingnan also arrived shortly after. Wang reported to Liang and others on the CCP's statement issued on the 17th. While they were talking, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department also arrived. Wang finished his report and then left. Peng visited Liang to explain the Democratic League's protest to the Central News Agency regarding its news reports, which it had previously submitted to the Central Propaganda Department. After Wang left, Liang and the other four immediately studied the Communist Party's statement. Liang and others also put forward their opinions, hoping that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would no longer set any conditions and that conditions should not be the premise for negotiations. Peng also agreed with this view, but Peng believed that the eight opinions in the government's communiqué were not conditions but procedures in progress. Peng then took his leave first, and the remaining four went to Mei Yuan New Village at 11:00 AM to visit Dong Biwu. Regarding the opinions they had just studied, they hoped that both sides would not set conditions for each other, nor insist on their opinions, and asked Dong to immediately convey this idea to Yan'an and Zhou Enlai in Shanghai. They did not leave until 12:00 PM. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Liang, Mo, Qian, and Miao went together again to President Sun Ke's private residence to convey this idea and hoped that Sun would convey it to the highest authorities. Sun also expressed his agreement, and they did not leave until 6:00 PM. Subsequently, after Liang returned to his residence, he notified people from the Third Force in Shanghai of this opinion via long-distance telephone. In addition, Sun Ke also sent a certain person as his personal representative, who took the night train to Shanghai at 10:00 PM, to maintain contact with people from the Third Force on behalf of Sun.

### If the Communist Party Hopes for Unification, It Should Accept the Chairman's Suggestions

New York Times Comments on the Chinese Situation

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, New York, 18th] The "New York Times" wrote today: "The reconciliation plan proposed by Chairman Chiang after the victory at Zhangjiakou can test whether the Chinese Communist Party is more Communist than Chinese, or more Chinese than Communist. What Chairman Chiang most desires is undoubtedly a unified China, but whether the Communist Party hopes for this is somewhat questionable. Some of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, like the Communists in countries outside the Soviet Union, are working to divide the country. But at the same time, there are many Chinese under Communist rule who possess the qualities of political democrats. If the Communist Party is most concerned with establishing a Communist regime in North China and the Northeast, then they will not pay attention to Chairman Chiang's eight suggestions. If they hope to form a unified China and advance democracy, then they may accept them. The question is whether they are more Communist than Chinese, or more Chinese than Communist."

### CCP Statement on Development

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to a dispatch from the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an on the 17th, A. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the following statement on the current situation today: "Since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, our party has been engaged in arduous efforts to cooperate with Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek to achieve domestic peace and promote democracy. To this end, we have repeatedly made concessions. In August of last year, our party's Chairman Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing for negotiations for more than 40 days and implemented the withdrawal of troops who contributed to the Anti-Japanese War from Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, southern Hunan, southern Hubei, and western Henan. This first concession resulted in the signing of the Memorandum of Talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Unfortunately, the day after the Memorandum of Talks was released, Chairman Chiang, having obtained US military assistance, issued the so-called 'bandit suppression' order, causing the tragic civil war to continue to spread across the country for as long as three months. Despite Chiang Kai-shek's breach of faith and the US government's injustice, our party continued its peace efforts, and on January 10 of this year, the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States jointly signed a ceasefire order, stipulating that all military conflicts and military movements throughout the country would cease after January 13. Chiang Kai-shek was also allowed to send five armies to the Northeast on the premise of a ceasefire. This was our party's second concession. On January 31, the Political Consultative Conference, composed of representatives of all major parties and social figures in China, unanimously passed five resolutions. At this point, our party made a third concession, the most important of which was the concession on the so-called old representatives of the National Assembly. At this time, the Nationalists in the Northeast, Jehol, Hubei, Guangdong, and other places had violated the ceasefire order and continued their military offensives. In Chongqing, the Jiaochangkou Massacre and the Xinhua Daily Massacre, which undermined the PCC resolutions, occurred. However, our party made a fourth concession and signed the extremely humiliating and self-demeaning military reorganization plan with the Kuomintang and the United States on February 25. However, the Kuomintang's military offensives, military movements, and political reactions intensified. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang openly demanded the overturning of the ceasefire order, the PCC resolutions, and the military reorganization plan, and US military aid to the Kuomintang was even greater than during the Hurley era. On March 27, the CCP made its fifth concession, allowing the Northeast to maintain its then-current state, which was no longer the state of January 13. However, although this agreement was also formally signed by the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States, the Nationalists immediately and completely destroyed it and launched a large-scale offensive in the Northeast, and the United States turned a blind eye to it. In June, the CCP made its sixth concession on various issues in the negotiations, but Chiang Kai-shek suddenly went through a US tourism agency and put forward five unreasonable demands, rendering all discussions completely ineffective. Since then, the Chiang army, with the continued massive assistance of the United States, has arbitrarily launched offensives throughout the country. In order to express its seventh concession, our party allowed participation in the informal five-person talks on reorganizing the government under the condition of guaranteeing a ceasefire. This minimum condition was also rejected by both the Chiang and US sides. In late September, the Chiang army began attacking Zhangjiakou. Our party, having reached the limit of its endurance, formally notified that if this offensive was not stopped, it would be a sign that the Chiang side was determined to break down completely. The joint reply from the Chiang and US sides was a final ultimatum with a ten-day deadline to accept Chiang Kai-shek's harsh demands. Our party made its eighth concession, only requesting that the Chiang side cancel the offensive against Zhangjiakou, and our party could participate in the three-person military talks and the five-person political talks. This proposal was ultimately rejected by both the Chiang and US sides, and the Chiang army occupied Zhangjiakou on the 11th of this month. All the above facts prove that what the Chiang and US sides are pursuing is only the surrender and elimination of the Chinese democratic movement, and that their military actions are固[certainly] for this purpose. All their so-called political solutions and peaceful mediation are also for this purpose, but to cover up and adjust military actions. As long as they do not abandon this goal, then every concession that our party makes with utmost sincerity and righteousness will not only fail to satisfy their desires but also make them think that this is a weakness that can be exploited in the Chinese people, which will instead encourage them to take every inch and force our party to leave the interests of the people and to completely eliminate our party and the Chinese democratic movement. Therefore, the Chiang side is now launching offensives everywhere throughout the country, conscripting soldiers and collecting grain, destroying national rights, civil rights, and people's livelihoods, and unilaterally issuing orders for the so-called National Assembly. The US side also firmly refuses to withdraw its troops and stop providing aid, indicating that they have no intention of peace and democracy. Under this dangerous situation, the people throughout the country hope that our party will uphold justice and turn the tide. Our party also vows to live up to the expectations of the people, to exhaust our wisdom and loyalty, and to fight to the end. Recently, some third-party figures have been making final efforts to save peace. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to deceive the people once again and achieve his own ambitions, deliberately puts on a peaceful posture and announced his eight conditions for peace on the 16th of this month. Our party believes that as long as Chiang Kai-shek is willing to implement a formal and effective peace under the pressure of the people, then our party can also forgive the past and renegotiate. However, in the past fourteen months, any solemn orders, promises, and guarantees could be arbitrarily torn up. Today's agreement will become waste paper tomorrow; today there are five or eight demands, and tomorrow there can be fifty or eighty demands. Our party, in order not to bear to make our suffering people accept this shameful deception again, has no other demands but only asks to restore faith first. What is the sacred standard of faith today? This is the ceasefire order personally signed by Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, and Marshall on January 10, and the PCC resolution unanimously passed by Chiang Kai-shek and all representatives on January 31. In order to express our final and greatest concession, our party solemnly declares that if all talks today are to have real results, the sacred validity of the ceasefire and PCC agreements must be recognized; that is, the restoration of the military positions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on January 13 must be recognized as the准[criterion] for all military negotiations; and the implementation of all PCC resolutions must be recognized as the准[criterion] for all political negotiations. Our party believes that Chiang Kai-shek and Marshall should value their own faith and personality, and there is no reason to overturn the sacred agreements they signed. As long as they have this minimum sincerity, our party will certainly continue to cooperate with them to the best of our ability in order to seek the real realization of peace and the real start of democracy. Our party believes that justice will ultimately prevail over everything. The Chinese people's struggle for peace and democracy will, no matter what difficulties and setbacks it goes through, eventually be able to restore the full validity of the ceasefire order and the PCC resolution. We are willing to encourage each other with all patriots and people of insight throughout the country."

Messenger of Peace Comes from Heaven A Record of Ambassador Stuart's Visit to Hangzhou Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng "Stuart" is a name that Chinese people have been familiar with for nearly fifty years, and the people of Hangzhou, China, are especially fond of this name. Because Stuart's parents came to Hangzhou, China, as missionaries, and Stuart was born in Hangzhou. Near the Jesus Church on Tianhanzhou Bridge now, there are still some elderly people who can clearly recall the kindness of the elder Stuart couple and how much the younger Stuart loved sports. And this younger Stuart has become a scholar, an educator, the American ambassador, and a messenger of peace for mankind.

Someone familiar with the Stuart family told me: "They moved from England to the United States and became American citizens, and then came to China. Mr. Stuart has the demeanor of a British gentleman, the vitality of an American, and the gentleness of a Chinese. But he does not have the false fatigue of the British, the impetuousness of the Americans, or the pedantry of the Chinese." Indeed, Mr. Stuart not only has the strengths of the Chinese, but he also deeply studies Chinese philosophy and loves China. In some ways, he has been influenced by thousands of years of Chinese culture. For example, when his mother passed away in Beiping, he insisted on accompanying the coffin to Hangzhou to be buried with his deceased father, and he would be sure to come and pay his respects every year.

Honorary Citizen of Hangzhou Mr. Stuart, when he was the president of Yenching University, students organized the Zhejiang Alumni Association. He would always attend their meetings and express many opinions. He called himself a "Hangzhou native," speaking a very good Hangzhou dialect. When he met Chinese people, he liked to talk in Chinese, and sometimes when he talked to Americans, he would also insert a few Chinese words. He can... read profound classical Chinese and write very good Chinese articles. If the American authorities could agree, we would warmly welcome Mr. Stuart to become a Chinese citizen, and a citizen of Hangzhou, China, because he especially understands Hangzhou deeply. He can memorize every street and every bridge. His childhood was almost entirely in Hangzhou. Now, although he has become the American ambassador, we should also invite him to be an honorary citizen of Hangzhou.

This Mr. Stuart, who himself admits to being a Hangzhou native, has been away from Hangzhou for more than a dozen years. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he always wanted to return to Hangzhou once. His second hometown, Hangzhou, is also eagerly awaiting his return. Every Hangzhou person also wants to see if Mr. Stuart has become thinner or fatter in recent years.

On this... October 18th, he really flew from Nanjing to Hangzhou. The officials and people of Hangzhou are preparing a warm welcome for this honorary citizen of Hangzhou. The purpose of his trip is purely to visit his parents' graves and to meet with his relatives and old friends to see if the beautiful lakes and mountains that he has been separated from for more than ten years are still well.

Rewarding the Pain of Longing This was a clear morning, and the morning glow formed a beautiful pattern. Many people were excitedly bathed in the morning light to welcome Ambassador Stuart, who grew up in Hangzhou. On the road from the Paizhipu Bridge Air Force Military Academy, cars followed one another, including the latest models of cars and the oldest types of trucks. The people on both sides of the road all knew that an important person was coming to Hangzhou. At 9:20, six or seven training planes flew back and forth in the sky. Their... were bathed in sunlight and sparkling. Many people waiting to welcome Ambassador Stuart were attracted by the flying planes.

At about 10 o'clock, the Ambassador's plane appeared, moving from far to near, from high to low, and gradually glided onto the runway. The propellers stopped moving, and the door of the plane opened. Ambassador Stuart appeared at the door of the plane. He was wearing a blue-gray suit and had a tall figure. Although he was a bit thinner, he was in good spirits. He slowly stepped down the stairs. After being introduced by Mr. Wang Kuaisheng, he shook hands with Chairman Shen Honglie, Secretary-General Lei Fazhang, Director Ruan Yicheng, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, Director of Education Hu Weike, reporters from our newspaper, and others who welcomed him. "Are you tired?" Almost everyone asked this question. "It's okay," "It's nothing!" This was Mr. Stuart's answer. Then, Miss Hu Rongshang, the daughter of Director of Education Hu, presented flowers. At this time, the Air Force Military Academy band played the national anthems of China and the United States, and more than 800 people stood in solemn silence. After the anthem was played, there were three more fanfare sounds, welcoming Mr. Stuart to inspect the honor guard of the Air Force Military Academy and the students of the military academy.

Those rows of heroic and high-spirited youth made Mr. Stuart have countless thoughts. Based on his memory and the current facts, China is finally on the road to progress. Although the speed of "walking" is relatively slow, it has not fallen back!

He nodded in salute to these many young air force officers. He stepped onto the prepared car and drove to the guest room on the left side of the Air Force School Auditorium for some breakfast, and then drove to the city of Hangzhou.

Directly... galloping, the people on both sides now knew that Mr. Stuart had arrived, so they really lined the streets to welcome him, and everyone... waved their hands to express their high respect. Mr. Stuart in the car nodded from time to time to the outside of the window, indicating that his pain of longing for many years had finally been rewarded.

In the afternoon, Mr. Stuart went to Jiulisong to sweep the graves. The Hangzhou Municipal Government had already prepared a garden for him, and Mr. Stuart prayed silently with great piety.

Three-Day Schedule in Hangzhou On the morning of the 19th, he will give a lecture at Zhijiang University and linger at Tianhanzhou Bridge, the place where he was born. At that time, I believe that many childhood shadows will be repeatedly shown in Mr. Stuart's mind. He will recall the children who played with him before and every plant and tree in his home. In the afternoon, he will attend the revival ceremony of the YMCA, which is presided over by Wang Kuaisheng, a student who has lived with him for more than 20 years. The 20th is Sunday. He will worship in the Lushantang of his father's memorial hall. In the afternoon, he will visit the famous scenic spots of Hangzhou. At four o'clock, a tea party will be held to welcome people from all walks of life to participate. On the morning of the 21st, he will go to... give a speech at the Qiaokongjun Military Academy, and then fly back to Nanjing by plane.

When Ambassador Stuart returns to his second hometown, we would certainly like to know the results of his recent efforts for peace in China, but he told reporters that he always maintained an optimistic view and was not at all pessimistic. We are really excited that a man of 72 years of age is still working tirelessly for peace in China. This makes us even more ashamed after our own gratitude.

We can tell Mr. Stuart that although the Northeast, North China, and Northern Jiangsu are full of smoke, Zhejiang is peaceful. (Sent from Hangzhou on the evening of the 18th)

Editorial Turmoil and Unrest in the Near East Since the request for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Dardanelles Straits was put forward, the sense of unease from Turkey to the Near East has been growing. Although the revision of the status of the Dardanelles Straits is still subject to international consultation, the proposal of this request has made the situation in the Near East tense. Reuters' correspondent in Turkey reported that the Soviet Union had taken large-scale military measures along the Turkish border, and Turkish Interior Minister Sukman, while inspecting the eastern provinces, said: "If we are attacked, all freedom-loving nations in the world will turn to our side, and the aggressive countries that dare to do what is wrong will suffer the same fate as Germany and Italy." It can be seen that the dynamics in the Near East are really worthy of the world's attention.

Another complex international issue in the Near East is Palestine. Since President Truman issued his statement supporting Jewish refugees returning to their homeland, it has aroused strong opposition from the local indigenous Arabs. President Truman's statement, even if its purpose was, as most observers say, to attract the votes of American Jews domestically, has stirred up anti-British and anti-American sentiment among Arabs abroad. According to a Reuters Damascus telegram on the 17th, Syrian Arabs are once again calling on Arab youth to arm themselves to defend the "Holy Land" because of the Palestinian issue, which shows that the emotions of the local people are already very激昂. How to resolve the Palestinian issue is less about the Jewish resettlement movement and more about the movement of the entire Arab nation in the Near East. The oil fields in the Near East are certainly worthy of the world's attention, but the importance of the Near East's strategic position in the world should not be ignored. It is a key area between "East" and "West," and controlling the Near East means controlling a major strategic stronghold in the world. Although the Near East is currently under the control of the so-called "Western countries," if the actions of the "Western countries" do not receive the support of the local people, the trends in the Near East are really worrying.

The Iranian issue is also deeply connected to the Near East issue. The subtle relationship between the "autonomous" movement of the people of Azerbaijan is self-evident. Under the Soviet Caucasian Federal Republic, there was originally the establishment of the Azerbaijani Republic. The "autonomous" movement of the people of Azerbaijan in northern Iran is undoubtedly supported by the Soviet Union. With the birth of this movement, we saw the emergence of a Kurdish ethnic autonomous movement in Iraq. Since the emergence of these "autonomous" movements, Iran and Iraq have had more troubles. Today, the situation in northern Iran remains the same, fortunately, the rebellion that appeared in southern Iran has now ended. According to a United Press International Tehran telegram on the 17th, the Iranian government published an official report stating: "The rebellion in southern Iran by indigenous people against the Iranian government has lasted for months and has now agreed to stop the rebellion. Both sides have agreed to increase the number of parliamentarians from Fars Province and extend the railway line to Fars Province. Amnesty the rebels and select provincial officials from residents of Fars Province." So, at least in southern Iran, the situation seems to have stabilized.

At the same time, it is worth noting British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement in Congress regarding the situation in Iran. He said: "The British government is very willing to establish good relations with the Iranian government. The British government wants to see Iran prosper, be strong, independent, and not be interfered with by outsiders. Soviet newspapers and Iranian broadcasts have repeatedly made major propaganda about unfounded rumors about British officials. The British government will try to inform the Iranian people of the truth... The British government hereby declares: British diplomats or consular officials in Iran have been ordered not to interfere in Iran's internal affairs, and the British government is very satisfied that British officials in Iran have not violated this instruction." At that time, Labour Party member Leiter stood up and asked Bevin: Can he be sure that other countries have not interfered in Iran's internal affairs? Bevin smiled and did not answer. It can be seen that the relationship regarding the situation in Iran is complex and subtle.

Of course, from a more distant perspective, the turmoil and unrest in the Near East is a microcosm of the turmoil and unrest in the world. However, since the beginning of modern history, the Near East has been a battleground for the great powers. The dream of the Berlin-Baghdad Railway promoted the outbreak of the First World War, and the traditional policy of "pushing eastward" promoted the Second World War. For the sake of lasting world peace, the turmoil and unrest in the Near East cannot be allowed to continue.

Land to the Tiller First Implemented in Pacification Zones Beneficial to Both Farmers and Landlords Xiao Zheng Talks About the Future of Land Reform [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The time for the reform of China's land system has matured. In order to understand the truth of this major reform, the reporter specially visited Xiao Feng, the chairman of the Chinese Land Administration Society, who told us that land reform is the foundation for establishing a new agricultural system in China and a prerequisite for industrialization. The association has appealed for years and has been praised by enlightened people from all walks of life. International scholars also agree that China must reform the feudal landlord system so that farmers can improve their lives, and China's economy can move towards prosperity and progress. After the restoration, the association, in view of various economic and political factors, believes that the time for implementing land reform has come, so it advocates taking immediate measures to implement land to the tiller. The highest leader of our party and the government have also praised this, but because the matter is of great importance and all preparations have not been perfected, it is only approved to be implemented first in the pacification zone. I was ordered to participate in drafting, and after multiple reviews, it has now been reviewed and approved by the National Defense Supreme Committee. In addition to setting out the land reform points in the administrative program of the pacification zone, a method for land disposal in the pacification zone has been specifically formulated as a guideline for implementation. When asked why this method was first implemented in the pacification zone, Xiao said that this does have its objective environment and value. Because the pacification zones, such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, northern Henan, and Hebei, Shandong, and the northeastern provinces, are the most famous wheat-growing areas in our country. It is best to operate on a large scale. This time, after the war, the population has decreased, especially the number of strong men who have sacrificed is very large, and the labor force is insufficient. Its innate conditions are not suitable for the tenant farming system. Therefore, according to this method, the promotion of land to the tiller is often very smooth. However, after farmers acquire land, they must first be persuaded to cooperate in management. Agricultural authorities and Farmers Bank must immediately prepare for ploughing cattle, agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizers for the spring ploughing next year. I have suggested to the Farmers Bank authorities that in addition to consulting with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to quickly transport tractors to each area and set up stations to rent them to cooperative farms, they should also order a large number of tractors and their ancillary agricultural implements from the United States for use by cooperative farms in each area. This land reform will transfer the land of landlords to farmers and enable farmers to operate the land they receive in cooperation, becoming modern new-style farms. Then China's new morning industry system can be started here. Because the areas that have been destroyed for a long time and the farmers in each area who have suffered a lot, the government really needs to make them get agricultural relief first and achieve economic prosperity as soon as possible. As for the landlords in each area, because of the implementation of this method, their land rights, which have been illegally distributed and have actually been lost, will be compensated again. The China Farmers Bank will provide land bonds with extremely solid credit. The land price can be recovered from the bank in installments every year, and there is no need to bear the burden of land tax again. Because according to this method, the land tax collected this time is transferred to the farmers who receive the land, so that landlords can invest in industries by recovering the land price in the future, becoming enterprises under the modern economic system, which is also beneficial to landlords. After Xiao explained that this method can take into account the interests of both the landlords and the farmers, he expressed his sincere expectations and ideals in a pleasant tone, hoping that the central and local agencies responsible for the promotion can understand the deep meaning of the central government's passage of this method, make proper plans for implementation, and make it effective quickly. Then, the promotion of this method to the country, so that the great cause of land reform can be fully realized, is what the national farmers pray for.

The Situation is Bright Urgent Relief is Planned Total Registration of Refugees in Northern Jiangsu More and More Refugees in Zhenjiang Request to Return Home [Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang News] The Su-Ning Branch recently determined that the situation in Northern Jiangsu is becoming clearer day by day. In order to carry out urgent relief quickly and accurately, it has specially formulated the "Guidelines for Relief and Inspection Work" and revised the "Refugee Registration Form" and "Flour Collection Certificate" styles. A general refugee registration will be held in various recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu on a regular basis. The personnel of the work team stations in various places sent by the headquarters of the China Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU) will form one unit, the Social Affairs Office, the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, and the local government will form one unit, and the Refugee Association and other groups will form one unit to organize a three-person group (that is, each group will send one person from the above three units) and divide them into several groups according to work needs to carry out the review work. The refugee standards are stipulated as follows: (1) Those who are displaced due to war, have a poor life, and have no job. (2) Those who are refugees with jobs but low income and whose direct relatives are three or more, and must be supplied with living expenses by them. After investigation, it is found that the total number of people in the household minus three, the rest can be given relief. (3) Public educators are not within the scope of relief, but if their income is low and their families are indeed refugees with a poor life, they can be handled in accordance with Item 2.

Bandit Cai's Troops Stirring County Magistrate Sets Out to Suppress [Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] The bandit Cai Haogong's troops, stationed near Guangfu Town in the third district of Suzhou, number about 200 people. They are equipped with a large number of light and heavy machine guns and rifles. Recently, they suddenly hoisted the false banner of the Democratic League, with the intention of expanding their power. At 7:00 PM on the 13th of this month, Cai personally led dozens of his troops to sneak into Tangcun Township in the Binhu area of the third district, inviting the township chiefs and Baozhang to do their best to incite them. They also set up mobile tax checkpoints at the important transportation hubs of Dachixiang and Yangshan Township on the Su-Xi Highway, levying tolls on passing trucks at 20,000 yuan per vehicle, euphemistically calling it a protection fee. In addition to ordering County Magistrate Lu to lead troops to suppress them nearby, the Clearing and Suppression District has also planned countermeasures.

He also induced the self-defense team to rebel and defect to the enemy. After the victory, the traitor Zhao actually mixed into the 17th Army Officer Training Corps and served as the captain of the squadron.

Suzhou Land Price Storm Interim County Council and Land Registration Office Turn Against Each Other [Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] Since the land prices in this county were hastily assessed by the Land Registration Office, people throughout the county believe that not only does it exceed the current value, but it is also ten times higher than the contract tax price approved by the provincial government two months ago. The levy of the rice land tax will inevitably greatly increase the burden on the people, and the post-robbery society cannot bear the burden. Therefore, the County Interim Council was previously requested to invite Zhang Zidao, Deputy Director of the Land Registration Office, and Special Commissioner Wu Zhongfan to hold a review meeting on the 15th, but the result was that the two sides broke up unhappily. On the 16th and 17th, the County Interim Council specially convened a meeting with the district office to solicit the opinions of all the township chiefs. All expressed that the valuation was too high and unanimously requested a more fair assessment. Therefore, on the morning of the 18th, it again invited the Land Registration Office to hold the second review meeting. The County Interim Council, based on public opinion, requested the Land Registration Office to re-evaluate the price. Deputy Director Zhang of the Land Registration Office replied: "The government authorizes the land administration agency to handle the valuation of land prices in full authority, which has nothing to do with the Interim County Council." The councilors, upon hearing this, believed that it was a disregard for public opinion and walked away in anger. A huge uproar occurred at the meeting. After much negotiation, it was finally decided that the Land Registration Office would provide evidence for the assessment of this valuation, and the Interim County Council would collect recent sales contracts, referring to each other to re-evaluate the new land price with the most accurate current value. The meeting ended at around 2:00 PM.

The Mayor Denies Postponing Conscription; Shanghai Will Implement Step-by-Step Once Central Government Issues Clear Orders; The Current Problem of Electricity Conservation Cannot Be Delayed

[Our Newspaper News] This reporter interviewed Mayor Wu at 5:00 PM on the 18th to inquire about various issues such as conscription and electricity shortages in the city. Mayor Wu replied as follows:

(1) Regarding the conscription issue, it is a decision made by the central government. Since Shanghai has been designated as a pilot area for implementing military service, it must be carried out. As for the rumors circulating that the city is postponing conscription, there is absolutely no basis for them. Shanghai is an integral part of the country, and it should take the lead in implementing government orders. Mayor Wu believes that implementing military service is a duty that all citizens should fulfill. Democratic countries such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have already implemented it. Therefore, after the city's civil affairs department receives instructions from the central government on implementing military service in Shanghai, preparations will be made step by step.

(2) Regarding the city's electricity shortage, Mayor Wu said that he felt extremely pained and disgusted by the waste of electricity. Many shops in the city keep their lights on at night, wasting a great deal of electricity. Mayor Wu must control this and use the electricity for factory production. Regarding how to conserve electricity, Mayor Wu offered principles: shops should aim to save 20%, and households 10%, while those using electricity within reasonable limits will not be restricted. Mayor Wu is very eager to realize any plan, and he hopes that the electricity conservation measures can be implemented starting from the first of next month. However, this plan still needs to be studied in detail by the Municipal Public Works Bureau before a final decision is made. Yesterday, Mayor Wu only stated: To increase production, electricity conservation measures must be implemented.

Census

(3) Mayor Wu has decided to personally investigate the city's household registration situation next month, accompanied by the Civil Affairs Department. He will conduct spot checks on household registrations in special districts, with the focus on household registration work and the cleanliness of each district, as Mayor Wu believes that to put the city's public security on track, household registration work must be done well first.

Streamlining Staff

(4) Regarding streamlining staff and implementing layoffs, Mayor Wu believes that it must be based on the decision of the Municipal Council, and the original staffing will be reduced by 15%. However, it is necessary to consider the current number of employees as the standard. If it is found that some staff members have not exceeded the staffing number and are extremely busy with their work, then there will be no possibility of further layoffs. If the number of people in various affiliated agencies exceeds the staffing number, then layoffs must be implemented to save expenses. The Personnel Department is currently investigating this.

Tuberculosis Prevention Committee Expands Organization

[Our Newspaper News] In order to utilize the medical equipment that the American Red Cross is about to donate to the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention Committee to promote tuberculosis prevention work, it has been decided to invite relevant organizations in the city and the Department of Health to jointly expand the organization into the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention United Committee.

Film Actor Suspected of Collaboration; Zhou Qi Still Not Summoned

[Our Newspaper News] Film actor Zhou Qi was previously accused by the city's Dazhong Evening News of having collaborated with the enemy. He filed a complaint with the local court accusing the newspaper of defamation. After the court's trial, the Dazhong Evening News was declared not guilty. On the other hand, the newspaper formally reported Zhou to the High Procuratorate, accusing him of being a traitor. Zhou failed to appear at the first inquiry and investigation. Zhou still did not appear at the second hearing and investigation yesterday morning. Only Hu Hanjun, the editor-in-chief of the Dazhong Evening News, appeared in court to provide evidence. The case was adjourned for further review.

Electricity Consumption in Zhabei Increasing Endlessly; Reasonable Restriction Measures Will Be Established; More Than 1,000 Electricity Meters Stolen

[Our Newspaper News] As winter approaches, electricity consumption is bound to increase, and the problem of electricity shortage in the city is becoming increasingly serious. This reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company yesterday. According to the conversation: After the victory, the Zhabei urban area has developed the fastest, and the amount of electricity consumption has increased endlessly, especially the increase in the past month is the highest. It is also said that the restriction measure of 90% or 80% of the electricity consumption in the previous month is not very fair, because users who waste electricity, even if they are 90% or 80%, still do not meet the original purpose of saving electricity, while users who have always been extremely economical with electricity will be greatly affected after 90% or 80%. Therefore, the company authorities are now planning to establish a fair and reasonable restriction measure based on the size of the user's electricity meter amperage. It is also learned that the trend of stealing electricity meters in the Zhabei urban area is very rampant. Since the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company took over, more than 1,000 large and small electricity meters have been stolen, resulting in considerable losses, and our country cannot manufacture them ourselves, so it is extremely difficult to replenish them. Therefore, the company authorities are feeling troubled by this.

Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Various Industries Crowded Together to Convene the National Assembly; Unanimous Approval of the Chairman's Eight Principles

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the industry associations of various industrial and commercial sectors in the city yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang to express their unanimous support for the government's promulgation of the National Assembly convocation order and the eight principles for handling the current situation: "To Chairman Chiang, Nanjing National Government: Recently, we read the government's promulgation of the National Assembly convocation order, adhering to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's testament of 'the world belongs to all,' in line with the republican system of government with sovereignty residing in the people. From this point on, more than ten years of arduous nurturing of political tutelage comes to an end. The government strives for the country, embodying the spirit of what the ancients called 'if the world belongs to all, there will be no uprisings.' This can clearly show the consensus and stabilize the inclination of both domestic and foreign political psychology. The factions of dissenting opinions lose their foundation, and the boundless future of China is truly built upon this. The associations hereby represent the city's industry and commerce in firmly supporting. Looking around the country, for the past year, wars have not ceased, and the people's livelihood has been withering. To have good politics, we must first seek lasting peace. Recently, we learned that Your Excellency announced eight principles for handling the current situation on the 16th of this month, using the spirit of moderation as the ultimate plan to end disputes. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor share the same sentiment and reason. We especially hope that benevolent words will be widely spread and bring about harmony. With the sincerity of seeking good governance, we express our unanimous approval and humbly request your consideration. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and all industrial and commercial associations respectfully submit."

Amidst Severe Housing Shortage, A Tragedy in Zhabei

Dai Jinji Copper and Tin Shop, No. 537, Datong Road, Zhabei, near the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, under the jurisdiction of the 14th District, belongs to Dai Fugeng from Taizhou, who borrowed capital of about 5 million yuan at high interest rates from relatives and friends to open a small shop, relying on it to maintain the lives of his family. On the 12th of this month, two former railway police officers from the Shanghai Railway Bureau went to warn him that the location belonged to the Railway Bureau. When Dai Baogen heard this, he thought that the housing shortage in Zhabei was severe, there was nowhere to move, the business would be forced to stop, the debts to relatives and friends could not be repaid, and the family's livelihood was on the verge of collapse, so he suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. He secretly prepared sleeping pills at around 9:00 PM, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, his family discovered it early and quickly sent him to Tongren Hospital for emergency treatment. It is said that he is out of danger.

Accused of Abusing Adopted Daughter; Court Hears Old Case

[Our Newspaper News] Xu Nigun, the former head of the puppet Economic Bureau, originally lived at No. 9, Daxing Lane, Julaiyuan Road. Before the victory, he relied on his power to try to buy the house at No. 8 next door but failed, thus forming a feud with Ms. Shi Yunfen, the owner of No. 8. In July of last year, after hearing tragic cries from the neighboring wall, he suspected that Shi Yunfen was abusing her 14-year-old adopted daughter, Ge Lian. Xu reported this to the puppet police station at the time, who transferred the case to the puppet procuratorate. Before this case could be concluded, the Japanese army surrendered, and Xu was arrested for treason. Later, the procuratorate investigated and prosecuted Shi after reviewing the case. The Eighth Criminal Court of the local court heard the case yesterday. Shi Yunfen and her adopted daughter, Ge Lian, appeared in court. Shi Yunfen testified that Ge Lian went to the noodle shop at No. 648, Changle Road, to work. She was accidentally scalded by a hot water bottle by the noodle shop owner, and she received daily medical treatment. Ge Lian yelled when the dressing was changed, which was not abuse. Ge Lian also testified that she had not been abused and wanted to return to her adoptive mother's home. The court ordered a retrial on the 25th.

Model Panda Dies in Regret, Unable to Enjoy the Beauty's Favor

[Our Newspaper News] The panda is dead.

She died in the middle of the night the day before yesterday. No one knows the exact time. The first person to discover that "Miss" had died was a worker named Chen Asi at the slaughterhouse. He had prepared bran and bean flour brought from Sichuan yesterday morning, wanting to ask the panda team to give "Miss" some breakfast. But "Miss" had already left this prosperous world and no longer needed to enjoy the earthly pleasures.

Director Wei Jingmeng of the International Propaganda Office and Captain Ke Ninghan, who escorted "Miss" to Shanghai, rushed to the slaughterhouse upon hearing the bad news. Their feelings were like a father mourning his beloved daughter, and the other was like a bridesmaid mourning the bride who died before her wedding. The sense of responsibility was mixed with the affection for a beautiful woman. Was it sadness? Was it sighing? Or was it annoyance?

The remains of "Miss" are temporarily stored in the cold storage room of the slaughterhouse. Going through two heavy iron doors, the reporters paid their last respects to "Miss." She lay quietly in a rectangular lead box, placed in a small room separated by wire mesh. The bloody carcasses of slaughtered pigs and cattle were her neighbors. Her limbs were stiff, her eyelids were not closed, and her eyes were still so black and so clear. Was she still thinking about her distant hometown, looking for the deep mountains and wilderness with lush bamboo? Was she trying to protest: She should not have died in such a cold guest room, she should not have been lying next to the corpses of pigs and cattle under the butcher's knife! The light was dim, and the cold air was piercing. Some of the warmth that we, the kind-hearted reporters, brought in caused the icicles on the ceiling to melt, and water dripped down, as if weeping sadly at the tragic fate of "Miss"!

How did the panda die? Was it because the wounds on her body when she was captured recurred? Was it because of the hardships and fatigue of the journey and the acclimatization? Or was it because the medicine for the wounds and the stench of the slaughterhouse damaged her spleen and stomach? In fact, no matter what, the fate of "Miss" had long been decided. Wasn't the experience of her predecessor "Miss United" enough to explain everything? Readers! It's like a person who loves freedom being imprisoned in a copper wall and iron wall. It's either madness or death, the only difference is sooner or later. "Miss"! Some people envied you for taking a plane and appearing on camera, and some people regretted that you didn't have time to cross the Pacific Ocean and go to the gold and dollar kingdom; but I say, you are blessed! You have escaped the torment, you have been freed from the pain, rest in peace!

The urgent telegram reporting the death has been sent to Mr. Peeval of the New York Zoo. The disposal of the panda's remains should be decided in a day or two.

Social Service Answers Readers' Legal Questions

Yi Jing, Tong Guojun asks: My friend, Mr. Mou, moved to the mainland with his service organization during the Anti-Japanese War. His family property in his hometown was sold by his second brother. His elder brother was kind and honest and did not dare to stop him. After the victory, Mr. Mou returned to his hometown and naturally could not recognize this illegal transaction. There are three questions, please answer.

(1) During the enemy-puppet period, contracts signed without a licensed person were illegal, and this contract has expired. Mr. Mou has also published a statement in the newspaper declaring it null and void, and the contracting party has never contacted Mr. Mou. Is this contract no longer in effect?

(2) The name of the contracting party of this contract was asked of the local enlightened town chief, but he did not recognize the person. The rent collector is the remnant of a famous traitor in the village during the enemy-puppet period. After checking the contract, it is found to be harsh and benefits him greatly. Therefore, before the expiration date, (Mr. Mou's sixth brother) repeatedly negotiated to recover it, but was rejected. Can we, in accordance with the rice price at the time, settle the losses of rent grain over the years based on the unreasonable contract? (Note: If there are any gains from this loss, they will be donated in full to the local primary school education fund).

(3) What procedures should be followed to settle the rent grain over the years?

(Lawyer Qin Liankui Answers) Regarding your friend's case, if the field sold by his second brother belongs to your friend, then the second brother's sale is legally invalid and does not affect your friend's property rights. The rent grain lost as a result can also be claimed for compensation. However, since your second brother is deceased and has no spouse or children, his brothers and sisters should be the heirs according to law. The other party also has the possibility of claiming compensation for the debts incurred by the second brother due to the sale. This is mentioned for your reference. As for how to settle the commemorative meeting, it should be fairly decided by the court. The relevant legal provisions of the precedent are as follows:

Court Explanation No. 3124 (June 24, 35th year of the Judicial Yuan's advisory to the Executive Yuan)

(Summary) The debt originally agreed upon by the parties in the occupied area to be paid in puppet currency should be settled in legal currency according to the ratio of puppet currency to legal currency stipulated by the government, but it does not hinder the application of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits after Recovery.

Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits after Recovery (promulgated by the National Government on December 18, 34th year)

(Article 12) After the establishment of a legal act, if the circumstances change so greatly due to reasons not attributable to the parties that it could not have been foreseen, and it is obviously unfair to maintain its original effect, the court should fairly decide to increase or decrease the commemorative meeting, or change other original effects.

(Article 13) The provisions of the preceding article apply mutatis mutandis to legal relationships arising not from legal acts.

Second Allocation of Yarn Completed; Third Plan Undecided; Mayor Wu Talks About Textile Management Policy; Focusing on the Development of Yarn and Cloth; Allocation Price Must Take into Account Factory Profits

[Our Newspaper News] The second group allocation of yarn by the Yarn Factory Joint Sales Committee was the last time yesterday. A total of 898 pieces were sold by private factories, and 633 pieces were sold by the Textile Construction Company. The selling price remained unchanged. The yarn sold by the Textile Construction Company is targeted at the dyeing and weaving industry, No. 1 to 265, 20-count Baoguang, and No. 267 to 311, 20-count Yangsi, No. 312 to 432, 42-count Shuiyue; the knitting industry, No. 1 to 110, 32-count Yanghe, No. 111 to 171, 32-count Funv; and the handkerchief industry, No. 1 to 43, 40-count Baoguang, and No. 44 to 73, 40-count Shuangniao. After the meeting, Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association, told reporters: The plan for the third group allocation of yarn has not yet been decided. Everything must wait until the Textile Industry Management Committee convenes a meeting next week before a decision can be made.

This reporter then visited the newly appointed director of the Textile Management Committee, Mayor Wu, who agreed to meet. When the reporter asked about the future plans of the Textile Management Committee and the date of the meeting, he humbly said: He is an amateur in the yarn and cloth industry and is very afraid that he will not be completely satisfied when he first takes office. However, if he is given a little time, he will do his best to eliminate the black market for yarn and cloth. Regarding the future regulations on the allocation price of yarn and cloth, in addition to considering its cost and legal profits, he will definitely consider the profits that can develop the industry. He said: Although my country's textile industry is said to have 5 million spindles, less than half of them are actually operating. Given the vastness of my country's territory and the size of its population, at least 10 million spindles are needed. Therefore, if the profit for developing the industry is not taken into account when determining the price of yarn and cloth, how can the textile industry develop? Regarding the entire yarn and cloth problem, he hopes to start with fair allocation in Shanghai and then gradually promote it to all parts of the country.

According to Mayor Wu, as of yesterday, the municipal government has only received one statistical report from the Towel and Blanket Industry Association. He said that the statistical data reported by several associations recently ordered by the municipal government often contain false information. For the amount of demand, most of the reports are exaggerated. The municipal government is determined to thoroughly investigate and crack down on this.

Sluggish Sales of Yarn and Cloth; Local and Foreign Market Prices Inverted

Yesterday, the yarn market was sluggish and very depressed because the market prices in various places turned upside down. The price of 400-pound standard 20-count yarn fell by 230,000 yuan again due to the end of the year. However, heavy-weight goods were absorbed by some gangs, and the special Double Horse brand remained stable and still managed to break through the 2.3 million yuan mark. Fine yarn was weak at first and then firm, finally trading at 2.31 million yuan. 16-count yarn was extremely sluggish and continued to fall by about 80,000 yuan. The double yarn was similar to yesterday. The yarn market has temporarily entered a volatile phase.

The cloth market has been declining in price for several days. Although there were slightly more buyers yesterday, the price still did not rise. Because the price in this city has exceeded the price in foreign cities, all gangs are holding a wait-and-see attitude because there is no profit to be made. Gangs in Yantai, Tianjin, and other places took the opportunity to sell off their goods before they were shipped, which could still make a profit. As a result, the price became even weaker. In the market, no one was interested in fine cloth, and there were few transactions for Four Gentlemen Serge. It is estimated that the asking price for Dragon Head brand is 86,000 yuan, and for Serge, 93,000 yuan. Given the current market situation, it will be difficult to improve for a while.

Government Bonds Gradually Rise

Yesterday's government bond trading saw some large players buying on the fifth floor and some selling on the seventh floor, showing a struggle. The Tong Bing bonds opened in the morning at slightly above 2,000 yuan and gradually rose from 2,000 yuan, reaching 2,300 yuan midway before encountering supply. They struggled within 2,150 yuan, and the result was 210 yuan better than the previous closing. A and B bonds rose slightly by 20 yuan, Tong Ding rose by 70 yuan, and Tong Wu also rose by 120 yuan.

Gold and Paper Money Firm

The black market price of gold yesterday was even more stable, with a narrow fluctuation. It opened in the morning at 2.215 million yuan, but it was very quiet, hovering around 2.21 million yuan. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank sold 100 taels at a price of 2.2 million yuan, which also had little impact. It once fell to 2.195 million yuan near noon, but still stood at about 2.2 million yuan at noon. The afternoon was even more stable. The next-day delivery price rose slightly, ending at 2.21 million yuan. The result was 5,000 yuan less than the previous closing. The exchange rate against the US dollar was about 539 yuan per ten taels. The price of gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars was the same as the previous day. The underground interest rate first loosened and then tightened, still ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 jiao.

Foreign currency was very quiet. The buying price of US dollars in the retail market was 3,500 yuan, but there were no purchases, and transactions were still difficult to start. The black market price has retreated to below 4,100 yuan. The afternoon was mediocre with little change, and the result was slightly lower than the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars were very stable, first low and then high, and the result was similar to the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still fixed at around 890 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,060 yuan to 1,080 yuan, and yarn and flower gangs made purchases. The British exchange rate was 14,000 yuan to 14,200 yuan, but there were not many transactions. The official exchange rate of the US dollar was not changed, and the transaction was still silent.

Lining Flourishing

Due to the limited production and inventory of woolen fabrics and the approaching winter sales season, supply is often unable to meet demand, and the market is trending upwards. Western suit linings, such as black carbon linings, French-style linings, gray soft linings, printed cotton cloth, sleeve linings, horsehair interlinings, silk-glossed feather yarn, satin backings, and bright satin, have all risen in price. In fact, even though the price has risen, there is a lack of spot goods, because the weaving volume of general factories is less than before due to environmental factors.

Reassessment of Raw Silk Prices May Be Held Next Week

[Our Newspaper News] Representatives from the Central Trust Bureau, the Central Bank of China Silk Corporation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs Commodity Inspection Bureau, and four other agencies held a meeting at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM and decided on the following prices for purchasing raw silk in the future: (Unit: 1,000 yuan, calculated per dan)

AA Grade 5,000
A Grade 4,550
B Grade 4,175
C Grade 3,975
D Grade 3,800
E Grade 3,600
F Grade 3,400

When reporters asked relevant people about their thoughts on this stipulated price, they replied: Spring silk may have a slight profit, while autumn silk will have a slight loss. It was said that there were two hours of discussion yesterday, and it is possible that a meeting will be held again next Tuesday to discuss it again.

Golden Needles Tighten

Recently, due to the small amount of golden needle vegetable available and the lack of activity in winter sales, dealers have gradually increased their purchases. Yesterday, some goods were released in the market, and the price has risen to 170,000 to 180,000 yuan.

Tongkang Money Shop in Jiyang Lane, Henan Road, has been stopped from exchanging due to a recent liquidity failure. The bill exchange has been sent out by the clearing house before 9:00 AM yesterday. The shop is proceeding with clearing debts and handling various follow-up matters. After the news of the shop's suspension of exchange spread, there were various rumors outside, some saying that it was caused by a failure in gold speculation. According to an employee of the shop: it was entirely due to liquidity issues. It is said that the shop is short of more than 200 million yuan this time.

Ship Goods Failed to Open; Rice Market Shows Strength Again

The rice market did not see a boom in both arrivals and sales. Registered orders amounted to only more than 6,000 piculs. Indica rice is in a firm position, but lower-grade goods are weak. The issue of laborers at Hexia has not yet been resolved, resulting in a failure to open the boats. Glutinous rice shops continued to be active. Du glutinous rice, sheep glutinous rice, and port glutinous rice all showed strength. High-grade customers were happy with the price of glutinous rice, but the price of medium-grade glutinous rice was low. White yuan glutinous rice was firm, and black yuan glutinous rice was very popular. The inventory of soybeans was still available, but it was still difficult to add color and break away from the sluggish situation. The arrival of wheat was still bleak. Sales of northern wheat declined, and southern wheat was also weak. The market was peaceful. There were very few transactions of mung beans, which were still depressed. Sales of red sorghum were also weak, falling by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame was still weak. The price of high-grade raw peanuts was stable, while the price of medium and lower-grade peanuts fell again by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

Export of Soybeans Still Under Preliminary Study

[Our Newspaper News] The Central Trust Bureau has made a preliminary study on the export of soybeans from Northeast China, but relevant people said that the matter is still far from being realized. The biggest difficulties for export are the lack of transportation tools and the high cost, which makes them unpopular overseas.

Caustic Soda Continues to Rise by 40,000

The price of caustic soda rose again yesterday, increasing by about 40,000 yuan per barrel. The previous rumor that a foreign company was distributing goods failed to materialize. The demand from local users and merchants was quite strong. According to people in the industry, the market price of caustic soda overseas has been rising continuously, making it difficult to expect the price to fall. It is currently the peak sales season, and the inventory is not large, so it is difficult to contain the rising trend. Siling's Australian imports were previously said to have arrived in small quantities, but there is no definite date yet. Merchants are vigorously seeking bleaching powder, and prices from all sides are not falling, so the price is bound to rise.

Brown Sugar Continues to Tighten

Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable. Brown sugar continued to be tight due to scarce goods. The association adjusted the spot price of medium-grade white sand to 135,000 yuan to 5,500 yuan, raw sand to 114,500 yuan, high-grade Shantou gang raised the price of green-infused sugar by 120,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan, Chong-infused green sugar by 118,000 yuan, totaling hundreds of packages. The Guangdong gang raised the price of green sugar slices from Shimen by 97,000 yuan, the Jian gang raised the price of Diaoqing by 110,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan, and the Yu gang raised the price of Gaoxing red sugar by 130,000 yuan, Zhongzhuang sugar by 127,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan, totaling 200 to 300 baskets.

Longs Close High; Hua Shares Rise and Fall Unevenly

Hua shares fluctuated quite a bit yesterday. There was still pressure from shorts in the middle, making it impossible to rally. The slight stability at the opening in the morning still could not last. The situation gradually weakened after 10:00 AM. Some overnight longs closed high, gradually falling back. The volume suddenly decreased in the middle of trading, so people's hearts were pessimistic, and the shorts were able to show their power, repeatedly lowering the price. Maya retreated to the 4,000 yuan mark, Yongsha to 733 yuan, Jingfu to 263 yuan, Xinguang to 269 yuan, and Qinzhen to 180 yuan before stabilizing. The situation slightly improved after 11:30 AM. Banks such as China General Commerce bought, so short covering gradually rose, allowing the price to rise. Near noon, the price rose again as people scrambled for profits, but it did not exceed the initial high price in the morning. Compared to the previous closing, the gains and losses of the hot shares were small. In the afternoon, the market immediately collapsed, and the rapid advance caused those who closed high to make a profit, and the profit-takers sold off one after another. After the high, the market gradually narrowed, causing panic among floating longs, and the situation was not very favorable. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the hot shares, Maya, Xinguang, and Qin, fell slightly, Yongsha rose slightly, Jingfu was flat, and Xinhe rose by slightly more than 1%. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang and Tongyi rose by half a percent, and Rongfeng Matches, Yonggong, Lianan, Wuhe, and Huafeng all rose slightly. Datong was flat, and there were no transactions for Zhongsi throughout the day. Xin Ya Cement and underwear fell slightly, and Jinglun rose by slightly more than half a percent. The total turnover in the front and rear markets was 1.181 million shares. Among the shares outside the market, except for slight declines in Commercial Press and Nanyang, the rest were flat.

Foreign shares were firm at first and then weak, with more transactions and a slightly more active situation. As a result, compared to the previous closing, United British Brewers rose by half a percent, while Yisha, Jardine Matheson, Wharf, Steel Industry, and Shipping were flat, and the paper industry fell slightly.

Central Bank's Policy Remains Unchanged; Does Not Compete with Ordinary Commercial Banks; The Focus of the Bank Affairs Meeting is on Reviewing Business

The third Bank Affairs Meeting held by the Central Bank in Nanjing opened on the 11th of this month and will be fully reviewed by today. It will close on the 20th. Currently, all parties attach great importance to the bank's meeting. According to the person in charge of the bank: The bank's business has been striving to advance the mission of the bank. (1) Regarding deposits, the bank does not compete with ordinary commercial banks in order to establish the central banking system, so all deposits are mainly from the industry. (2) Regarding loans, the bank provides loans to all industries and export industries that have normal needs. The recent industrial and commercial loans are one example, which is to handle so-called re-mortgage and rediscount, but in order to prevent speculation or misappropriation, ordinary loans are not handled.

Real Estate Is Not Mortgaged for the Time Being, Ordinary Loans Are Not Made

For the time being, ordinary loans are not made. Some people hope that loans do not require collateral or mortgage of real estate, but this is not possible under the current legal restrictions. (3) Regarding remittances, in order to avoid the concentration of floating capital in Shanghai, causing trouble, restrictions still have to be imposed on remittances from various places, but legitimate needs can still be taken care of. The total amount of monthly remittances is huge. Recently, in order to facilitate the allocation of commercial banks, the remittance rate is planned to be reduced to 70% as prescribed. (4) Regarding the export industry, the bank attaches great importance to it. In order to support exporters in developing international trade and strive for balance in international payments, three types of loans have been organized: the first is packing loans, which are handled when exporters transport export materials to Shanghai;

### West Lake's Beauty Remains, Hangzhou Warmly Welcomes the American Ambassador, All Officers and Students of the Aviation School Receive Inspection

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 18th] The various circles of Hangzhou City knew as early as ten days ago that Ambassador Stuart would return to his second hometown (Hangzhou) on the 18th of this month, so all preparations were made early. Yesterday morning, the weather was clear and warm as spring. At 7:00 AM, a special car to welcome the ambassador went to the Qiaotou Air Force Officer School airport to await his arrival. When our reporter's special car arrived at the Qiaotou Aviation School at 9:00 AM, the school's Education Director, Hu Weike, first explained all the preparations made for the ambassador's special plane to arrive at the airport. Then, Education Director Hu first invited Chairman Shen of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to walk to the airport to pre-inspect the school's officers and students and honor guard, totaling more than four thousand people.

After the pre-inspection was completed, Education Director Hu invited our reporter and Director Ruan of the Civil Affairs Department, Director Pi of the Construction Department, and others to take a photo in front of the plane. After the photo was taken, the C47 aircraft of the Development Center arrived over Hangzhou City. When the door opened, Ambassador Stuart took his hat and cane, and after getting off the plane, Hu's daughter, Hu Chang, presented flowers, and people's organizations presented welcome letters. Mr. Stuart repeatedly said, "Thank you." Then, after the band played the American and Chinese national anthems, Chairman Shen accompanied him to inspect the military appearance standing on the left side of the road.

Ambassador Stuart then had breakfast on the sofa and talked with Chairman Shen for ten minutes. The reporter sat in front of Mr. Stuart and Mr. Shen and faintly heard that the rhetoric of Mr. Stuart's Chinese was no less than that of scholars who study Chinese characters. Then, he drove into Hangzhou City. At twelve o'clock, he attended a banquet at the Foreign Affairs Reception Center hosted by the Municipal Government.

The lakes and mountains of Hangzhou are so beautiful that even Los Angeles cannot compare, truly a paradise on earth.

### Ambassador Answers Reporters' Questions: Came Specifically for Tomb Sweeping and the Youth Association Opening, Will Receive Honorary Citizenship of Hangzhou Today

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 18th] After Ambassador Stuart arrived in Hangzhou, he took a short rest at the Foreign Guest Reception Center. Reporters from various newspapers in Hangzhou requested the ambassador to make a statement. The ambassador answered the reporters' questions separately in a friendly and cordial Hangzhou dialect:

(Question) What are your thoughts on coming to Hangzhou this time? (Answer) I am very grateful for such a warm welcome from everyone today. This trip to Hangzhou is purely for tomb sweeping and attending the opening ceremony of the Youth Association. On the one hand, I hope to rest for a few days in this beautiful scenery.

(Question) What are the Ambassador's views on Chinese youth? (Answer) I hope that Chinese youth will continue to be enthusiastic about their country and work more for the country under the principles of the Three People's Principles. (Question) When the Ambassador was at Yenching University, he asked to join the Zhejiang Fellow Association, which shows the Ambassador's deep love for Zhejiang. This time, all circles in Hangzhou City have asked the Ambassador to be an honorary citizen of this city. I guess the Ambassador will definitely agree? (Answer) I am deeply grateful for such a warm welcome from the Mayor of Hangzhou City. (Question) The Ambassador was originally scheduled to return to Beijing on the 21st. I wonder if it is possible to stay in Hangzhou for a few more days? (Answer) I received a call from Shanghai yesterday asking me to go to Shanghai. Because I have decided to come to Hangzhou, this time of stealing time from a busy schedule is already too much and does not allow me to stay longer. (Question) Is inviting the Ambassador to Shanghai related to the recent negotiations? (Answer) Yes. (Question) In the Ambassador's view, is there more hope for this negotiation? (Answer) There is hope. Since I participated in the mediation, I have always felt that there is still hope for China's future. (Question) Can the Ambassador tell us the crux of the lack of success in repeated negotiations? (Answer) (Hesitating) It is inconvenient to say, for fear of causing misunderstandings on both sides. The reporters then took a photo with the ambassador on the steps.

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 18th] Mayor Zhou hosted a banquet for Ambassador Stuart at the Foreign Guest Reception Center this afternoon, inviting Ambassador Stuart's staff, Vice President Zhou Zhong, Chairman Shen, Director Zhang, Director Ruan, Education Director Hu, our reporter, and more than thirty others. During the banquet, Ambassador Stuart repeatedly toasted to the future of China and the United States. After the meal, Stuart met with our reporter alone and said: He has not returned to Hangzhou for ten years. Today, it is like meeting old acquaintances, the rivers and mountains are still the same, and the scenery is as beautiful as before, which is very comforting. The purpose of this visit is to worship the graves of my parents and brothers in Jiulimiao and take a short rest so that I can work hard for China's future again. The reporter then asked about the current state of the country. He replied: I intend to remain silent for the time being and will proceed after Shao Lizi and Wu Tiecheng return to Beijing. He personally remains optimistic about China's future. As for the matter of Ambassador Stuart becoming an honorary citizen of Hangzhou City, he said he felt very honored. Finally, he told the reporter that he had decided to fly to Beijing on the 21st to work hard for peace talks again. After the banquet ended at 2:05 PM, he took a short rest and then went to Jiulimiao to sweep the tombs. The cemetery is located between Yue Fei's tomb and Lingyin Temple. The tombstones are intact, but the walls are slightly damaged. Ambassador Stuart immediately entrusted someone to repair them as soon as possible. After the worship, he returned to the Foreign Guest Reception Center to attend a tea party for fellow Christians. In the evening, he attended a public banquet hosted by Chairman Shen, Chairman Zhang, and Hu Weifan, attended by more than forty heads of various agencies, and dispersed happily at nine o'clock.

### Black Market Price of Rayon Drops to 6-7 Million, But No Transactions Result

The price of rayon fell sharply yesterday. The morning market was quite chaotic, and prices varied. The price of 120 Tianqiao Bright Rayon in the afternoon was announced to be 3.45 million yuan, but no transactions were made at this price. It was 600,000 yuan lower than the previous day, and the semi-gloss and other types were more than 700,000 yuan lower. The price of 75 semi-gloss was originally short, but now it has been raised to be on par with 120 semi-gloss. Factory transactions were quite deserted. However, the price of CD grade was 100,000 yuan higher yesterday. The price of 44/42 D grade orders was 3.95 million yuan, and the price of 30 dry warp 5 dan was 2.85 million yuan, which was 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The sale of silk goods was very popular. The price of rayon goods fell due to the drop in raw material prices. The price of Minsheng Xinyan brocade was slightly lower by 2,000 yuan per piece, the price of Hua Jin crepe was slightly lower by 100 yuan per yard, and the rest were flat.

China Trust now sets to allocate 2,000 boxes to the silk weaving industry every month. 1,000 boxes will be allocated and sold this month. The first batch of allocated goods totaled 640 boxes and 08 packages the day before yesterday. The allocation and purchase orders have been sent to the Silk Weaving Association for distribution yesterday, and payment and delivery are limited to this morning.

There are still 360 boxes left for allocation this month, which can still be applied for by the silk weaving industry next Monday (purchase is available every Monday and Thursday). The original proposal to allocate to silk merchants has been temporarily cancelled because the market price has fallen sharply. The price per dan is only 3.2 million yuan and there are few inquiries, and the factories already have enough supply, so there is no need to purchase from the market.

In addition, there are requests for allocation and sale from other places besides Hangzhou, such as Shengze. The Bureau is currently conducting an investigation, and a decision may be made next week.

### Exchanging Textile Information, Sending Experts to Visit British Representatives, China Hopes for Three Things from Britain

[Report from our newspaper] The Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs dispatched experts Zhang Sili and Zhang Diaogong to Beijing by night train on the 16th to discuss with the textile industry representatives of the British Business Delegation. This trip also brought a memorandum, which described in detail the situation of China's textile equipment production and future needs, which will be handed over to the British representatives, and they will be asked to provide general information on the British textile industry. Official sources said: China needs Britain's assistance in three areas: (1) In terms of tools, emerging countries are competing and are actively replacing new machines, and plan to obtain a part from Japan; therefore, what China hopes from Britain is only the supply of various parts for textile machines. (2) In terms of raw materials, the quality of Indian cotton is not good, and China does not hope for it. What it currently expects to supply is Australian wool. (3) China is very willing to draw on the excellent technology and long-term accumulated experience of the British textile industry.

### Food and Transportation Industries Must Pay Business Tax

It ordered the local direct tax bureaus to collect business tax from this October for the manufacturing and sales of wheat, bean flour, sorghum flour, corn flour, and other food industries, as well as the transportation industry.

### American Cotton Plummets, Bulls Close Positions and Short Selling

[Also, New Orleans, 17th] Cotton futures closed down $2.50 to $10 per bale today.

According to Reuters, New York, part of the reason for the price drop was that bulls closed their positions to prevent losses, and another reason was that there was a lot of short selling in the market to seek to buy back at lower prices.

### Locally Made Imitation of Taiwan Red Tea, Yulong and Ruichang Both Buy In

Since the supply of B.O.P. marked Taiwan fine red tea has stopped, there is a strong demand for Indian tea. Local tea factories are putting imitations on the market. Currently, Chunyuan and other tea shops are packaging about 800 boxes for Yulong and Ruichang Foreign Firms. The price is 140,000 to 150,000 yuan per dan.

Stores on this street still have a hand in it, while customers from all over the country are in a sluggish state.

### Notice for Importing Radios, The Customs Clearance Procedures are Extremely Complicated

Recently, some passengers have been importing radios. Due to a lack of understanding of customs clearance procedures, the customs have often discovered and detained them. According to customs information, regarding passengers importing radios, they should first fill out an import declaration form (one white, one green, and one red verification form), then go to the Import Supervisor's Office on the second floor of this Customs House to submit the declaration form, and then go to the Valuation Department, Group 3 for valuation. After the valuation is completed, after obtaining the tax payment certificate, apply to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation at 872 Yokohama Bridge for a passport. After obtaining the passport, go to the tax collection office on the ground floor of this Customs House and pay the tax with the tax payment certificate. After paying the tax, hand over the first and second copies of the tax payment receipt and the passport to the Deputy General Affairs Counter of this Customs House to cancel the passport. After the cancellation is completed, the Deputy General Affairs Counter will send someone to the Import Release Office on the second floor of this Customs House to collect the release receipt before going to the Daguan Wharf to retrieve the radio.

### Kerosene and Diesel Rise Together

Recently, the price of gasoline at gas stations has increased by 150 yuan per gallon, and the retail price of five-gallon kerosene has also increased by 1,000 yuan. The retail price of diesel varies greatly, ranging from 320,000 to 360,000 yuan per ton in bulk. The price of barrelled diesel depends on the quality of the iron barrel. The price of the original new barrel is 26,000 yuan higher than the bulk price, and the price of the second-rate barrel is about 20,000 yuan. According to people in the industry, most of the sales to retail merchants are in small quantities. If the quantity is more than 20 or 30 tons, the transportation cost is relatively low, so the unit price is also reduced accordingly. The prices of retail kerosene at gas stations in this city have not yet been determined, so they are not sold temporarily.

### Local Paper Arrives in Shanghai

### Taxis Have Not Considered Raising Prices

There have been rumors in recent days that gasoline prices are rising, and taxis will also follow suit. Regarding gasoline, only the fees have been slightly increased, and the price of gasoline has not increased, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to a letter from the Taxi Industry Association of this city, the rumor that taxi prices will rise is also inaccurate. The original letter stated: "It is reported that 'the price of gasoline suddenly increased by 150 yuan per gallon yesterday morning, and it is heard that taxis will also follow suit. The association has scheduled a meeting to be held in the coming days.'" The association has not considered adjusting taxi prices or holding a meeting.

### Winning Streak Continues: Qunsheng Defeats Huasheng in First Battle; Tianjin Team Suffers a Setback with 52-41 Score; Too Many Points Lost in First Half, Impossible to Recover

[Our Report] The Qunsheng Basketball Team continues to maintain its winning streak. The strong Tianjin team, Huasheng, failed to break their line after a fierce battle of forty minutes last night and were defeated by Qunsheng with a score of 52-41. In the first half, Qunsheng took a significant lead of 36-13. There were approximately over four thousand spectators last night, and the atmosphere was lively and enthusiastic.

Qunsheng Controls the Game

Throughout the entire game, Qunsheng maintained control. Initially, it was close, with scores tied at 4-4, 5-5, and 7-7, but Qunsheng gradually pulled ahead. In the first quarter, the score was 15-9. In the second quarter, under Qunsheng's fierce attack, Huasheng's entire line collapsed and fell into chaos. Qunsheng took a lead of 36-13 in the first half, a difference of 23 points. In the second half, Huasheng gradually improved, while Qunsheng did not press too hard, and the score gradually narrowed. The third quarter ended with a score of 42-27, and the final result was 52-41.

Offense and Defense Both Show Differences

Qunsheng once again demonstrated their sharp and agile novel tactics last night. Huasheng failed to utilize their height advantage and frequently committed fouls. Under Qunsheng's lightning-fast attacks, Huasheng's entire line was flustered and chaotic. Their five-man zone defense provided Qunsheng with the best offensive opportunities. In the second half, they switched to man-to-man marking, and the situation gradually improved. However, they were on the defensive, and under Qunsheng's strict defense, they often struggled to get the ball into the basket. Their long shots, such as Wang Hongbin passing to Chuan Jinsheng, were indeed excellent performances, but they lacked opportunities to showcase their skills. Liu Xueqi, the top center in North China, failed to perform at all last night and was far below his usual standard.

Qunsheng Afraid of the Huge Momentum

Huasheng fielded Liu Xueqi, Wang Hongbin, Chuan Jinsheng, Wang Youcai, and Wang Kanruo, while Qunsheng fielded Chen Jinde, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui. After exchanging pennants, the game began. Chen Jinde scored four points with consecutive free throws, while Liu Xueqi and Wang Youcai showed excellent marksmanship, tying the score at 4-4. The score then became 5-5 and 7-7. Qunsheng's Wenhua and Wenzhang scored repeatedly, and the score steadily increased. Huasheng relied on Lai Hongbin scoring a goal, and the first quarter ended with Qunsheng leading 15-9. In the second quarter, Huasheng replaced Wang Youcai with Guo Jinming. Qunsheng seized the opportunity and scored, with Wenchang excelling on both sides, leading the team to 28-12. Huasheng replaced Wang Kanruo with Wang Youcai, but they were already far behind Qunsheng. The first half ended with 36-13, with Qunsheng taking a significant lead.

Huasheng Unable to Catch Up

After the break, the game resumed. Huasheng replaced Liu Xueqi with Yin Huanwen. Wang Hongbin and Wang Youcai each scored a point. Qunsheng called their first timeout. Huasheng was still active, and Jinsheng and Youcai scored repeatedly with long shots. The third quarter ended with 27-42, with the Tianjin team catching up by a few points. In the final quarter, Huasheng brought Liu Xueqi back into the game, replacing Yin Huanwen. Before long, Chuan Jinsheng fouled out with five fouls. Wang Hongbin scored two more impressive points. Qunsheng replaced Chen Jinde with Zhang Yuyi. Jinde scored under the basket, and Hongbin and Youcai scored with long shots, narrowing the score to 37-47. Qunsheng called a timeout. Chen Jinde replaced Cai Wenhua. At this point, the game was intense, and Yang Renhui, Wang Youcai, and Cai Wenzhang were all dismissed with five fouls. Soon, the regulation time expired, and Qunsheng defeated Huasheng with a score of 52-41.

The Ministry of Interior believes that household registration should be prepared and implemented in accordance with the new household registration laws and regulations, and therefore provides several key points: (1) Each county and city should complete the establishment of household administration agencies, the training of household registration personnel, the preparation of registration forms and books, and the preparation of publicity and survey investigations in the upper annual period of the 36th year. Household registration should then begin in the afternoon, and household statistics should be sent at the end of the year. (2) In order for each county and city to handle household registration in a proper manner and achieve tangible results, personnel should be dispatched to supervise and assess the districts. (3) All matters to be handled in the next year should be listed as central tasks, and the necessary expenses should be included in the estimated budget for the 36th year for the sake of implementation. It is reported that the municipal government has been notified by telegraph to take note and handle accordingly.

### Japanese Girl Saga Hiroko in a Conspiracy Drama of Japanese-Puppet Intermarriage

— Wu Boxiang

The Northeast Without Cherry Blossoms Unveils the Secrets of the Puppet Manchu Imperial Family

Saga Hiroko is the Japanese wife of Pujie, the younger brother of Puyi, the puppet Manchu emperor. The news of her being escorted from the Northeast to Shanghai has been published by the Central News Agency in various Shanghai newspapers. Having personally experienced this matter, I would like to write down what I have heard and known, so that the general readers can have a clear understanding of the puppet Manchu imperial family.

In the spring of 1937, the Japanese cherry blossoms were withering on the land of Northeast China, unable to bloom the so-called symbol of Japan. However, a major political conspiracy was rapidly being pushed forward in the cold spring of Changchun! On March 1st, the "Succession Law of the Manchu Empire Imperial Family" was promulgated, and on April 3rd, Pujie's wedding ceremony was suddenly announced in Tokyo. These two events were inextricably linked politically: First, Article 5 of the Succession Law stipulated that "If the emperor dies without descendants, his throne shall be succeeded by his younger brother and his descendants." It was well known that the puppet emperor Puyi could not have children. Therefore, it was undoubtedly certain that Pujie would succeed the puppet emperor after Puyi's death. However, Pujie's marriage partner happened to be a Japanese noblewoman. Therefore, Japanese politicians boasted about this political wedding ceremony as a way to strengthen Japanese-Manchu cooperation and implement Japanese-Manchu intermarriage. However, the compatriots in the Northeast were troubled by this grand wedding ceremony. More than forty years ago, the old drama of "Japanese-Korean Imperial Intermarriage" was about to be replayed in the Northeast. If Pujie's Japanese wife gave birth to a child who became the next generation of puppet emperor, then, just like the "Japanese-Korean Merger," Japan could legitimately annex the Northeast. The Japanese politicians and the Kwantung Army even selected Saga Hiroko as the female protagonist in this major political conspiracy. At the age of twenty-four, after graduating from Gakushuin, she was studying oil painting with Okada Saburo. Because she was a descendant of Fujiwara Kamatari, and her grandfather, Marquis Saga Kinkatsu, had served as the president of the House of Peers, she was an ideal female protagonist in all aspects. Therefore, through the matchmaking of Honjo Shigeru, the commander of the Kwantung Army, she married Pujie.

Her fate was destined to be unhappy and to suffer. The year after the wedding, rumors spread that she was pregnant and about to give birth. The Kwantung Army authorities began planning the future imperial family of the "Manchu Empire." Unfortunately, she gave birth to a girl. A year later, at the end of March 1939, she gave birth for the second time, and it was another girl. The Kwantung Army was suspicious and disappointed in her. Their solicitous attitude turned cold. She was still young, and she hoped to give birth to a boy for the third time to reverse her fate. She continued to hope so until Japan surrendered.

Saga Hiroko Recounts the Truth of the Marriage

A Japanese woman sacrificed by policy, she herself recounts the circumstances of her marriage to Pujie as follows:

"Among my relatives, there was a Marquis Nakayama who came to my house to ask for my photo, saying that he was introducing me to a suitable person to be my matchmaker. My family was an absolutely old-fashioned feudal family. Marriage arranged by parents was a matter of course. I had no room to object.

The daughter of Mr. Okata, the director of the gastroenterology hospital, was a good friend of the Third Princess. Because I knew Miss Okata, I got to know Puyi's younger sister, the Third Princess, and I learned more about Pujie. My parents said that he was a good young man, and it was difficult to find such a person even among Japanese young men. The sons of wealthy families often become纨绔子弟, and they hoped that I would not object to this marriage. At the same time, Mr. Shioya Atsushi of the Gakushuin (school for children of Japanese nobles) boys' department also praised him as an outstanding young man. I still remember that from that time on, we began to socialize. The first time we met was at my house, and my father (Marquis Saga Sanekatsu) was very happy. At that time, he ordered me to marry him. Because he had studied in Japan for a long time, he had completely learned Japanese customs, and he said that there was no imperial law in the Manchu Empire, and that he lived like an ordinary commoner, so I decided to marry him and become an ordinary Manchu wife in the future.

After that meeting, Pujie became a member of my family. My three younger sisters and brother treated him like their own elder brother. When he came, we would chat together or go for a walk together.

On April 3, 1937, the wedding ceremony was held at the Military Hall in Kudan, Tokyo. I remember that the initial matchmaker was Marquis Nakayama, but during the ceremony, General Honjo Shigeru (Commander of the Kwantung Army during the September 18 Incident) came forward as the introducer. At that time, the cabinet ministers of the Hayashi Cabinet, including the Prime Minister and all ministers, attended."

Post-Marriage Life Repeatedly Interfered with by the Japanese

She also said: "After the wedding, my husband Pujie went to the Chiba Infantry School to study. We had a residence in Momi River, near Chiba. He was a lieutenant in the army. Our life was like that of an ordinary middle-class person. We only hired one maid, and I still did the cooking myself. He went to school every day and took the train to school with ordinary students. Looking back now, I feel that life was very happy at that time. I was born in an old-fashioned Japanese noble family, and he grew up in an old-fashioned imperial family, so there was not much difference in customs, and I did not feel that there was much difficulty.

In October, we came to Manchuria. We held another banquet at the military hall in Changchun, which was considered a wedding ceremony in Manchuria. At that time, all the important figures of the Manchu State attended the ceremony. However, the Commander of the Kwantung Army at the time (Ueda Kenkichi) did not seem to be present. Then, we went to meet Emperor Puyi and also met his family in the palace.

Once I arrived in Northeast China, I felt that I was not free. It turned out that the Japanese in Northeast China and the Japanese in mainland Japan seemed to be two different races. The difference in attitude and spirit surprised and discouraged me. For example, Lieutenant Colonel Yoshioka (a special agent sent by the Kwantung Army to the puppet Manchu palace, then still a lieutenant colonel) interfered with every trivial matter in our family. I was angry and annoyed, but what could I do?

No. 117 Xiwantai Street in Changchun, a room the size of eight mats, was our residence. It was a military officer's residence of the Kwantung Army. Like the general Kwantung Army lieutenant colonels, we were assigned one building. The house was too small. Even my husband's study could not be separated. Without a private car, we hired only one servant and lived a hard life.

On February 26th, the fifth year of Kangde (1937), my eldest daughter Huie was born. As a mother, I was busy taking care of my child. Because the child was Chinese, I, as a Japanese mother, was confused about how to educate her and it was not easy to solve. Relying on my natural maternal love, I loved my child. In December, my husband was transferred to be the military attaché of the Manchu State Embassy in Japan. My family and I moved to Wakamatsu-cho, Ushigome-ku, Tokyo, and lived a free life for a whole year. On March 18, the sixth year of Kangde (1938), my second daughter was born in Tokyo. Two months before, my husband was ordered to be transferred to be the deputy director of the Fengtian Training School, so I, the parturient, came to China after recovering.

In the ninth year of Kangde (1941), my husband went to the Japanese Army War College to study. The family moved to Tokyo again and lived in Tanuki-ana-cho, Azabu-ku. (Tanuki-ana-cho is the location of embassies of various countries.) The following year, my eldest daughter Huie was seven years old and went to the Women's Gakushuin.

The war had reached a difficult climax. During the wartime life, we relied on rations, which were better than the average Japanese household in both quality and quantity.

In December, even the Army War College stopped classes. Except for my eldest daughter Huie, who stayed in Tokyo's Shitaya-ku due to schoolwork, entrusted to her maternal grandparents, we decided to leave dangerous Japan and come to Manchuria again. At that time, the traffic situation was all in a dangerous state, and we had to risk taking a plane. After arriving in Northeast China, I breathed a sigh of relief. Tokyo had terrible air raids, and it was much safer in Manchuria.

In fact, we were unwilling to live in China. In Japan, if we were commoners, we would live very freely, but once we arrived in Manchuria, we would be treated badly everywhere. The Japanese treated my Chinese husband, even though he was the emperor's brother, with arrogance. In August, Japan surrendered, and my husband left me until today."

### "Imperial Relatives and Nobility" Fleeing

Yet Still Ended Up "Unable to Escape"

On the night of August 10, 1945, the puppet Manchu palace was filled with unprecedented commotion and unease. People from the Kwantung Army came to say that the Soviet army had launched a war on the border, and Changchun would become the front line. So Saga Hiro, with her seven-year-old daughter Huisheng, followed Puyi, Hongqiu (the puppet empress), other imperial relatives, and "Palace Affairs Department" officials, a total of more than 200 people, and in the darkness mistakenly boarded a train to start fleeing to Tonghua. Lieutenant General Yoshioka and others were the escorts of this fleeing group, a mighty procession. A large number of real objects, luggage, and personnel from the puppet palace transferred trains at Siping Street and went straight to Tonghua because Tonghua was only over a hundred kilometers by train from Ji'an. The planned route was to escape to Korea via the upper reaches of the Yalu River railway at Ji'an. They imagined that the situation would not be so serious, so they got off the train at Dazhuzi, requisitioned a large number of civilian houses, and set up a temporary "Palace Affairs Department." The railway staff were all Japanese, the 800,000 Kwantung Army still existed, and the Japanese police were still the local authorities. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito's surrender edict was transmitted to Dazhuzi by radio waves. This fleeing group panicked. Yoshioka took Japanese military police and male members of the puppet imperial family with Puyi to Changchun to make a decision. Unexpectedly, Soviet military aircraft were waiting in Changchun, catching them all in one fell swoop and transporting them all to Soviet territory. Perhaps Dazhuzi was too remote to interest the Red Army. Saga Hiro, accompanied by Puyi's wife Hongqiu, concubine Li, and others, was safe and sound under the protection of the Japanese police.

On the 10th, snow had covered the northeast. This group of more than 200 despondent "imperial relatives" left Dazhuzi and fled to Tonghua. At that time, the CCP army appeared in Linjiang. Like fish escaping the net, they entered another net. After their property and luggage were inventoried, she lived with the Communist army. In half a year, the Communist army changed teams several times. Their fleeing "imperial relative" group had almost disintegrated. Eunuchs, maids, and attendants all went their separate ways. She took her child and came to Changchun with the Communist army on April 24 to see her former residence and inquire about her husband Pujie's news. As soon as Puyi's "Noble Consort Li" arrived in Changchun, she immediately returned to her family's pancake shop. Only six people were left in Saga Hiro's group, including Hongqiu. The Communist army took them to Jilin. The day after the Kuomintang planes appeared over Jilin, she fled to Yanji with the Communist army headquarters, separating from Hongqiu. In mid-May, they went from Yanji to Mudanjiang, and then to Jiamusi. There, she met many war criminals held by the Communist army, such as Okada, president of the puppet Xingye Bank, Xiao Teng, president of Mantuo, and Miura, president of the Red Cross. On July 2, she arrived in Harbin from Jiamusi, seemingly breaking away from her "imperial" connections and becoming an ordinary Japanese overseas resident, because she had changed her name to Hamaguchi Mikiko, and her seven-year-old daughter Huisheng had also changed her name to Hamaguchi Asako.

### Maid Betrays Her: Saga Captured

After Saga Hiro arrived in Harbin, she stayed at the Red Swastika Temple, where a maid, Kumamoto Masakimi, was introduced by the Japanese Overseas Residents Association to serve her. The local Japanese tried every means to protect her, because in the feudal eyes of the Japanese, it was a great honor to be able to show courtesy to a noble. On August 25, she moved from the Red Swastika Temple to the Mian's house in Daoli, Harbin, to live in seclusion.

In mid-August, the government and the CCP agreed to repatriate Japanese overseas residents in the Communist army area. From the Songhua River in the north to Lafa in the south, tens of thousands of Japanese were sent to Huludao in an endless stream. Saga, who had changed her name to Hamaguchi, disguised herself as a peasant woman, wearing old Japanese military uniforms, black glasses, and an old straw hat used by Japanese farmers, covering her forehead. On September 5, she mingled with a large group of Japanese overseas residents, left Harbin, crossed the Songhua River, was inspected by the Kuomintang army, and boarded a train to repatriate Japanese overseas residents back to their country, passing through Changchun and Shenyang. On September 10, she arrived in Jinzhou and was accommodated in the Xinmin District concentration camp, waiting for vaccinations.

It was not easy to arrest a Japanese woman among the tens of thousands of Japanese overseas residents being repatriated every day. Saga Hiro's name was not on the repatriation roster. Even if they compared each photo with the past, no one would have thought that the pitiful middle-aged peasant woman was the female protagonist who had once been responsible for great political conspiracies. Finally, she was found among the 50,000 to 60,000 Japanese overseas residents in the Jinzhou concentration camp. It turned out that her foolish maid, Kumamoto Masakimi, could not change her name or disguise herself. Finding the maid naturally meant finding her. Although the Japanese tried every means to protect her, on September 16, she finally arrived in Huludao with her daughter Huisheng.

Short in stature, 34 years old, with a slight hunchback, a pair of large eyes filled with melancholy, and often a nervous laugh. She could speak a not-very-accurate Beijing dialect. She said how pitiful Puyi was, and she also guessed that her husband Pujie was already dead. One daughter was in Tokyo, and one daughter was by her side. Perhaps the Japanese political schemers no longer wanted to use her? Her dream of becoming a future "Empress Dowager" was shattered. Moreover, marrying Pujie meant she was only a concubine (Pujie's former wife was Pu Shi Tang Jiao. After the September 18 Incident, she eloped with a large amount of wealth and broke off relations with Pujie.)

### The Puppet Manchu Imperial Family Tenaciously Clung to Puyi

The puppet emperor's full name should be Aisin Gioro Puyi. According to the meaning of the Manchu language, Aisin is gold, Gioro is the surname, and Puyi is the name, so "Gold Surname Puyi" is a more appropriate way to call the puppet Jin Puyi. He was the eldest son of Zai Feng, the second younger brother of Guangxu. In addition, there was Pujie, who was one year younger than him. It can be said that he had a group of siblings. Starting from the second princess (meaning the second daughter), there were six "imperial sisters." The second princess was married to Xiang Duigu, the grandson of Zheng Xiaoxu, a marriage that broke the rules because Zheng was from Fujian and was definitely not a Qiren (Bannerman). Because of the "imperial grace," Zheng worked in the puppet Manchu Foreign Ministry. The husband of the "third imperial sister," the third princess, was Runlin, the younger brother of the puppet empress Qiu Hong, who had hereditary mental illness. The "imperial son-in-law" of the "fourth imperial sister" was Zhao Guoqi. Like Runlin, after training at a Japanese military academy, he served as a military officer in the "Imperial Guard" protecting the "imperial family." The fifth princess married the Qiren Wan Xixi, who also never left Puyi's side and was responsible for protecting the puppet emperor. When victory came, Puyi fled to Tonghua, and they "attended by his side."

Forgotten and neglected by Puyi were his half-siblings born to his stepmother: Puyi Ren, who is now 29 years old, and the married sixth princess, and the seventh princess waiting to be married at the "Prince Chun's Mansion." They did not go to the Northeast to be ennobled and had been living a life of seclusion in Beiping.

### "Puppet Manchu Empress" Qiu Hong: The Before and After of Her Death in Prison

"It is reported that Puyi's first wife died in late August in Dunhua, Jilin. Note: Qiu Hong fled to Tonghua with Puyi before Japan's surrender. Later, after Puyi was taken to the Soviet Union, she was captured by the Communist army. When the Communist army entered Changchun, they also brought her to Changchun, then moved her to Yongji, and then escorted her to Yanji, where she was imprisoned. Qiu Hong was originally in poor health. Coupled with the dispersal of her attendants, she died of illness." (Northeast Press, Changchun News)

Qiu Hong is dead. After reading the above news, one can imagine how miserably Puyi's first wife, who had been called "empress" three times, died. She was the daughter of Rongyuan, the former Qing Zhili Northern Circuit Intendant, one year younger than Puyi, and would have been 40 years old this year. In 1922, when Puyi was 17 years old, the Forbidden City in Beiping held its last lively event. Under the guidance of his English teacher Reginald Johnston, Puyi wanted to Westernize everywhere, cutting off the long braid that symbolized the Qing Dynasty and specially taking an English name called "Henry," expressing his admiration for the English King Henry VIII. Therefore, his "empress" had to be given a Western name, called "Elizabeth." The rules of the court were one empress and one consort. At the same time as Qiu Hong, the Noble Consort Shou was married. She was a Qiren from the Erdet family. In November 1924, Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City and moved to his father's Prince Chun's Mansion by Shicha Lake. Qiu Hong was always by his side. Then, after Puyi was escorted to Tianjin by Japanese Minister Yoshizawa and lived in seclusion on Miyajima Street in the Japanese concession, Qiu Hong became addicted to opium due to illness and also discovered hereditary mental illness. She and Puyi were only nominally "emperor and empress." In October 1932, after Puyi was sent to Lushun by the Japanese ship Bijisan Maru, Kawashima Yoshiko, the daughter of Prince Su, first persuaded Qiu Hong to accept the glory of being the puppet Manchu empress. On March 1, 1934, Puyi ascended the throne as a puppet emperor in Changchun. As Puyi's first wife, Qiu Hong was also qualified to become the empress. However, Puyi did not like her. She had an unusual mental illness and was also a heavily addicted opium smoker. Puyi preferred a Manchu consort named "Tatara." According to a United Press report from Tokyo on August 19 by Central News Agency: "Puyi pounded the witness table and shouted loudly: 'My wife was poisoned to death by the Japanese. I know who did it, it was Lieutenant General Yoshioka.'" The reason for Puyi's outrage at the Tokyo Far East International Military Tribunal was the death of his beloved Tatara consort. The ridiculous Japanese warlords felt that Puyi did not accept marrying a Japanese wife, so they poisoned his Tatara consort. At the same time, they felt that it was necessary to maintain a one-empress, one-consort system. Lieutenant General Yoshioka selected the daughter of a pancake shop in Changchun as Puyi's "new consort."

Victory shattered the dream of the puppet Manchu imperial family. More than 200 fleeing "imperial relatives" arrived in Tonghua. Puyi and his male "imperial relatives" were taken to the Soviet Union. The future "Empress Dowager" Saga Hiro was brought to Shanghai. The puppet empress Qiu Hong was imprisoned in an iron cage in Dunhua and died of illness after being paraded. Only the "new consort" Li returned to Changchun and lived in her family's pancake shop.

### Let's Talk About Romance!

— Bao Wu

The sky is high and the air is crisp. Wouldn't it be nice to talk about romance!

Fat, thin, rustic, pretty—look, there are so many empresses! People's enthusiasm is so high! This is not a Hollywood movie scene; these are real people and events. Originally, after the end of the war, some people were busy with construction, and some people were busy with revitalizing industry. Naturally, some people would inevitably be busy electing empresses!

What are we busy with?

At least, we have been somewhat busy when queuing to buy movie tickets.

What a glorious sight! Let everyone shout long live romance.

However, let's get back to the point. Electing empresses and the like may not be entirely without reason. For example, fitness can certainly be promoted; and the idea that female bodies must be treated as taboo has no reason to continue to exist today.

In summary, I talked about romance as above.

### Sea Queen: Miss Jenny is pushed to be the "Sea Shell Queen" holding sea shells on the beach, smiling for a photo.

### "Baltimore" Camera Miss competition, organized by the Baltimore Association of Photographic Journalists, Miss Betty is measuring her figure, participating in the competition.

### Talking About Small Actions

— Hong Weifa

People's small actions are sometimes more worthy of attention than strange behaviors. Because from these small actions, we can glimpse people's inner intentions, so as not to be obscured by the release of smokescreens or the performances of disguises.

I read in the "Bin Tui Lu" the story of Wang Gen and others discussing dying for their principles:

"Wang Gen, Hu Guang, and Li Guan were all Jinshi in the second year of Jianwen and were awarded the title of compiler. Initially, Wang Gen was first, but because of his appearance, he was replaced by Hu Jing, who was Hu Guang. Wang Gen was second, and Guan was next. When Emperor Wen's army entered Jinchuan Gate, Xie Xu, Wu Pu, and Gen Jing lived together in the same house and all went to Pu's house to swear to die. Jin and Jing were both generous and clear about their intentions, but Gen cried silently, and Pu suddenly laughed. The three left. Pu's son, Xingbi, who was Kangzhai Xiansheng, was still young at the time and whispered: 'It would be a great thing if Uncle Hu could die!' Bo said: 'No, Uncle Wang will die!' Before he finished speaking, Jing was heard calling his servant through the wall: 'The outside is in chaos, be careful of the pigs, don't let them escape!' Pu looked at him and said: 'You can't bear to lose a pig, let alone your life!' A moment later, Gen was heard crying and drinking poison to death, while Jin and Jing both rushed to greet the emperor's horse."

I also read the story of Hong Chengchou's unfulfilled death for his principles in the "Xiao Ting Za Lu":

"When Emperor Wen recovered Hong Wenxiang, it was said that Fan Jianfeng, the magistrate of Fan, said that when Hong was captured, Emperor Wen ordered the late Wen Su Gong to persuade him. Hong scolded him endlessly, and Wen Su pacified him with good words. He then talked with him about ancient and modern events. At that time, there was dust accumulated in the beams falling on Hong's sleeves, and Hong repeatedly brushed it off. Wen Su hurriedly resigned and reported to Emperor Wen: 'Chengchou will not die! He still cherishes his worn clothes so much, let alone his body?' Later, Wen Nang indeed surrendered, as Gong had expected."

Calling the servant "be careful of the pigs, don't let them escape," and "repeatedly brushing off" the dust accumulated in the beams falling on his sleeves, these are all small actions. But discerning people can glimpse the other party's inner intentions from this. Sure enough, neither Hu Guang nor Hong Chengchou were able to die for their principles. Because Hu Guang's "generous and clear about their intentions" and Hong Chengchou's "scolding him endlessly" were just the release of smokescreens, or it could be said to be a performance of disguise. But even while they are performing, who is not a hero!

We have all seen plays. When performing a tragedy, the audience must be moved by the performance's realism to shed tears of sympathy. If there are some oversights in the actions, I am afraid that not only will they not earn people's tears, but they will also provoke people's contempt. Because from those negligent actions, it has already been clearly told that this is fake. The so-called "playing a fake role for real" means that even small actions cannot be overlooked. But it is difficult to say. To avoid neglecting even small actions, the inner intentions must be in sync with the actions. Otherwise, in some small actions, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be a discrepancy between body and mind. In this way, cold-eyed observers can glimpse their inner intentions and discover their true form, without having to wait until after the makeup is removed.

### The Life and Works of Literary Artists

— Hua Lin

Literary artists are different from entrepreneurs. One is the real world, and the other is the imaginary world. The works of literary artists are their lives, and the lives of entrepreneurs are their works. There are also literary artists who have the genius of entrepreneurs, and there are also entrepreneurs who have rich imagination and creativity, such as Alexander and Napoleon, who are both entrepreneurs and have artistic genius, such as Da Vinci and Goethe, who are both literary artists and have the ability to manufacture industry and manage government affairs!

The life and works of literary artists vary depending on each individual's genius. In terms of pure literature, the poorer and more painful the life of a literary artist, the richer and more outstanding their works often are! Some people say that "genius is madness." In fact, whether genius is madness cannot be based on his life, but only on whether the content of his works is harmonious and consistent. It should be known that the lives of literary artists are not necessarily harmonious with real life. To truly understand literary artists, one must understand them from their works. Life is often in contradiction and conflict. Aristotle said: "Great people are mostly in pain." Longbuso said: "Genius is mentally ill." Voltaire liked to drink coffee, Lyser liked to drink wine, and Maupassant liked to drink anesthetics. Chinese literati are also mostly like this. Literary artists often have quirks, so their lives are often extremely unharmonious and in conflict with reality! There is also a Chinese saying that poetry becomes more accomplished through poverty, just like the Dutch painting saint Rembrandt in his later years, who was poor and destitute, but his works became more brilliant! After Beethoven went deaf, he was able to compose the Ninth Symphony in his painful struggle. The Russian writer Dostoevsky experienced all the sufferings of the world and had "Crime and Punishment" published. It can be seen that "pain is sacred." For literary artists, pain can be said to be a place that Heaven uniquely bestows. Therefore, their lives may not be normal, and they may have many pathologies. But their lives are completely placed in their works. Only their works can recognize their true selves and recognize their genius. If we talk about the lives of literary artists, not everyone is necessarily harmonious and consistent with their works. Because of the conflict between ideal and reality, their lives are also much more complex and difficult.

Throughout history, many patriotic poets could not die in their hometowns, many writers who saved the world and pitied people could not be understood by their contemporaries, many geniuses and masterpieces were buried in the chaos of war, and many generous and tragic figures were victimized by a ruthless and cold society! The so-called creator is jealous of talent, and the tree that stands out in the forest will be destroyed by the wind, and the crane that stands out among the chickens will be insulted by the crowd. Literary artists living in this kind of society, people with wisdom and passion, will not be approved by the world. In other words, as I said before, "pain is precisely the place that Heaven uniquely bestows on literary writers." A true literary artist who does not have many scars on his red heart is very mediocre.

Pain not only purifies life, but also creates life, making his works richer and more sublime. Ordinary people are destroyed by the grinding of pain, while literary artists regard it as a rose crown of great reputation, with many thorns on it. The flower is dyed with blood, and only genius is happy to accept this special honor!

### Traces of Autumn Clouds

— Jiang Dachen

Is there any scene in the world more fleeting and uncertain than autumn clouds? They are bright and transparent, light as silk, and roll and disappear freely and suddenly. People can sit in front of a window, or lie on the grass, savoring the philosophy of white clouds and gray dogs, chanting: "Autumn clouds go without a trace, where is the previous period? Playful desires are unfamiliar, wine companions are desolate, not like when I was young!" (Liu Yong: Boyhood Travels)

Autumn is truly a season of reverie. It is sparse and delicate, bright and unadorned. It lures people to sink into the net of memories. It makes people rub their own joys, sorrows, warmth, coldness, sweetness, bitterness, and辛酸 in the burst of mixed feelings of regret and knowing smiles. Autumn is not like spring, which is full of vitality, with peach blossoms and green willows everywhere, and the sound of birds and the fragrance of flowers, full of hope for the future. It is not as magnificent as summer, with endless heat and brilliance like a tapestry painting. Autumn is the low point of vitality, the melancholy after the high-pitched melody; it is a good time for distant mountains like黛, tall wutong trees sparse, rain hitting plantain leaves, and the sound of crickets and birds on the horizon. If winter is an old man in his twilight years, with stiff hands and feet and approaching stagnation, then autumn is the charm of a young woman, the vastness of a strong heart, familiar with the divergence of the world's paths but unable to shake off the memories of past luxury; although the illusions are just beginning to wake up, it is really a bit at a loss.

People can think about how those friends of the idealists in "沙宁" (novel title) were surging and forging in the eight years of war. Some can naturally still stubbornly infiltrate people's hearts like high mountains and flowing water, but most of them have to be like a flash of lightning before a summer thunderstorm, no, it is better to say that they are like disappearing autumn clouds, although they are radiant, or brilliant as brocade, but ultimately they are like the illusion of a bubble.

Beside a city with pagoda shadows and mountain lights, he said goodbye to his close friend, entrusting thousands of trivialities; proceeding in a desolate village, in a pitch-black night. However, the lover of great ideals can only regard life as a poem, a passionate poem. He wants to live decently and die happily. He does not want to be cut with a dull knife, he despises that kind of humble and cautious hypocrite. Finally, in a season of disappearing autumn clouds, his close friend disappeared like autumn clouds.

People can also think about what it was like to be a wandering traveler in a mountain city bombed like rotten tofu, suffering from lonely homesickness, facing the illusion of autumn clouds, counting the wanderings of their own footsteps, and not remembering what true feelings they had spoken to those confidants that seemed true and false. Had they fallen into the pursuit of fame and fortune? Had they resigned themselves to following the crowd? This is the only quality worth upholding, and other than this, is there only emptiness left?

People can even more think about being trapped in a cage, facing that small window, envying the agility and vividness of autumn clouds, while they themselves tasted the cruelty that should not exist in the world on a night before and after the Double Ninth Festival, struggling with a dying breath under the iron boots, Japanese swords, wooden sticks, and cold water of their children.

Oh, you fleeting, uncertain, and suddenly changing autumn clouds! You are the symbol of life, the mystery of the universe. You seem to be laughing at our foolishness, or you seem to be pitying our infatuation. Our hearts are dazed, our nightmares are heavy, facing a vast fire, and unable to extinguish it with a wise heart. I say: what we lack: is precisely the freedom to stretch out like you, without being bound.

Oh, you fleeting, uncertain, and suddenly changing autumn clouds! Where shall I go to seek the traces of your past travels? I know that countless memories linger on your beautiful feathers.

Autumn clouds, autumn clouds, you give people warm comfort, you give people a cool breeze, you are the light of life, you are the soul of the universe.

### Mother and Child (Sculpture)

— Royer Bloche

### A Lament for the Panda

— Lan Ning

Nine months ago, you came into this world. Three months ago, you came into contact with human civilization. Just four days ago, you arrived in Shanghai, a so-called international city, but you couldn't endure it any longer and returned to your heavenly home, where you should have lived.

In the evening, seeing the news of your death, I was speechless, utterly speechless—

But the thoughts in my mind could not be controlled, rising and falling incessantly:

Miss, how fortunate were you to be born a rare species in the world! The moment you were born, your species determined your preciousness. Countless people were stirred by you, captivated by you. To capture you, three hunters were mistaken for besiegers by bandits, shot, and killed. University professors and experts ventured deep into barren lands for you, enduring hardship. News reporters tirelessly pursued your whereabouts, reporting on your daily life. Newspapers daily published special features and beautiful photographs of you. When you came, you traveled by plane, almost across most of China, accompanied by two American military officers. The travel expenses alone amounted to more than 690,000 yuan, and along the way, you were supplied with delicacies from your hometown.

However, how unfortunate were you that between you and the many people who loved and fawned over you, there was always this wooden cage, this iron chain. Did they really love you? Did they really care for you so much, fearing that you might be cold, hungry, or starving?

I have never been to the continuous, towering mountains of Wenchuan, but I can imagine you strolling with your mother along the streamside, peeling and eating the delicious, tender bamboo shoots when hungry, and drinking the clear spring water under the waterfall when thirsty. Peaceful, leisurely, it was such a harmonious life. But unfortunately, there are humans in the world. Even more unfortunately, humans love you, love you madly. Even to the point of killing your poor mother, in order to bring you to this so-called civilized world.

Clearly, from the day you left your hometown, you were listless and unhappy. You ate less and slept less. Were you missing your hometown? I imagine. —Were you missing your mother?

Moreover, upon arriving in this civilized world, you were housed on the top floor of a slaughterhouse. In the quiet of the night, the lights flickered. Alone in this wooden cage exposed to the cold wind, you heard the tragic cries of cattle and sheep before their execution below, you saw the patches of fresh red blood... Even humans have feelings, and you are a fellow creature with four legs, how could you not be affected!

Although cattle and sheep are subject to human slaughter, and you are subject to human adoration, your fates are ultimately the same!

Now, you have finally gone, and that's good too—a broken flower branch will wither sooner or later anyway. —May you return to your mother, may you rest in peace, may God bless your journey.

### Walking in the Wind and Rain

— Jiang Dun

(I)

How many times the wind and rain,

Have blown down leaf after leaf of yellow...

The first sigh,

Like the vast west wind,

Towards the distant

Cloudy sky...

Only remains,

A lonely heart,

Still like a bright red maple leaf,

Swaying in the wind and rain!

(II)

Don't ask me where I come from,

Or where I am going,

Look at my body covered in mottled mud,

And you will know that I am a traveler in the wind and rain.

The cold raindrops,

From my disheveled hair,

Flow over my burning chest,

Mixed with sweat, mixed with tears,

Nourishing the suffering land of my motherland that I have walked through!

I don't want to grab an umbrella,

Or borrow a nice raincoat,

I just want to leave my hard-working footprints,

On this muddy road!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 67

— Ye Jingfeng

The small chief was embarrassed. I thought this chief was not a bad person, so I asked him to explain what was going on. He hesitated for a long time before sighing, "To tell you two, we're just trying to make a living here, who wants to do this, it's really not human... You know there are spies on the train who take orders from others, if they don't report anything for a day, they lose two yuan and five. That's the truth. ...The three brothers were originally guards on the train, you saw it clearly. Those who make a living as spies all have powerful backers, if they are told to move, they can't just sit still, they have to move. ...”

"So, what's going on with getting off the train?" I asked him.

"The spy first wanted to cover up the train's reputation, and second, he wanted to find out what kind of people you are, maybe he even wanted to search your luggage, otherwise, he wouldn't have any material to report."

"So, why didn't he do it?"

"This," the small chief looked at Tiger Brother, "He saw that this little... little... little..." He couldn't say "little" anymore, calling him "little brother" he didn't dare, "little young master?" it wasn't appropriate, "little old master?" he couldn't say it either, "little ancestor," he was willing, but he was afraid he wouldn't accept it, he stammered for a moment, then suddenly his face lit up, "This 'little master,' 'yes!'" He finally got such an address, and couldn't help but praise himself with a "yes!" before continuing, "Seeing his high skills, fierce work, he must have come from somewhere. Don't look down on him for making a living as a spy, what does he rely on? It's still a few Jianghu secrets, a pair of eyes that see things clearly. ..." As he spoke, he swallowed another mouthful of saliva.

"Keep talking!" Tiger Brother was probably hungry again, his liver fire was very high.

"Yes, yes..." The chief seemed to want to bow, "He understood himself, so he threw the blame on the three guards, and each of them ran away."

"He probably has companions on the train, it can't be just him alone. So, why didn't he call a few more?"

"That's impossible... First, whoever starts the matter, gets the job, and earns two yuan and five. Secondly, since he saw that it was not easy to provoke, the other partners also have eyes, who would be willing to bump their heads against a nail?"

I saw that he was finished talking, and I didn't want to ask any further, so I asked him for a car. He put on that toothache-like smile again, saying that as long as we were willing to wait, he could rush to Shuangqiao Town to make a phone call and call a car from the city, maybe after waiting for more than an hour. As he spoke, he put away his smile and showed that cold look again.

"Shall we go for a stroll in Shuangqiao?" We left the police station, and Tiger Brother, carrying the bag, asked me as we walked.

I knew he wanted to eat something, so I thought for a moment and said, "If it's on the way, we might as well stroll around, otherwise, let's just walk along the highway, buy whatever we see to eat, okay?"

Tiger Brother raised his hand towards the east, winked, "Okay. There's a fork in the road ahead, and there are also a few houses, there must be food to sell."

After walking for more than a mile, we arrived at the fork in the road, and sure enough, there was a food shop, but those steamed buns looked very dirty, covered in flies. Tiger Brother rushed forward to ask the waiter inside if there were any seats. The waiter shook his head and stared at us attentively. Just then, the curtain in the inner room opened, and a middle-aged woman came out, with fair skin and a white complexion, but dressed like a villager, and very gentle. She looked at us, then walked up to us:

Free Talk

### Men and Women

— Shao Fu

A friend who swore never to marry, recently invited me to his wedding. Some people are speculating about the bride's magic, others say it's because he's reached that age. I am not a superstitious fatalist, but I quite believe in nature, between men and women, it is often impossible to jump out of the circle of their surrounding environment.

I remember these two famous sayings:

"A man without a woman is like walking in the dark."

"A woman without a man withers."

Who wants to walk in the dark for a lifetime? Who wants to wither for a lifetime? Here's a joke, a man said I embrace bachelorhood; a woman said I will never marry; someone interrupted and said: You two are like-minded, you can grow old together. Both men and women expressed their agreement, and asked this third party to be their wedding witness.

The word nature I mentioned earlier, if visualized, can also be called the Old Man Under the Moon. If you don't believe me, you can take any newly married couple as an example and study their various environmental relationships, and it will not be difficult to find clues. As for so-called unexpected good news, it is almost a rare occurrence.

Humans, although called the spirit of all things, are actually muddleheaded, and heaven and earth are ultimately limited, which is sad. Several single friends seem to be rebelling, regardless of success or failure, their fates are quite the same.

### Paris Bans Prostitution The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women Declares War on Prostitution

— Chai Fei

Paris is banning prostitution. Gaston, secretary-general of the French Prostitutes' Association, shrugged his shoulders and said, "The new ban is like the American one, well-intentioned, but ineffective. Prostitution is like wine, it can never be banned by a piece of paper. Girls become prostitutes voluntarily. In Paris, they earn more in one night than female shop assistants and maids earn in a month." His only responsibility is to collect taxes from prostitutes and submit them to the government. According to him, seven out of ten francs earned by a prostitute belong to the government. What kind of business can the government levy such a heavy tax on?

His arch-rival, Madame Richard, claims that the generous profits from prostitution are extracted by brothel owners. She refutes Gaston's claim that prostitution is voluntary, "The truth is this," she said, "Brothel owners employ many villains who entice women into prostitution. They use huge bribes to buy off doctors and scientists to publicize that prostitution is harmless to general social life if it can be controlled." She knows a brothel owner who lives in a country villa and never goes to the brothel that is his cash cow. Many other people who hold brothel stocks never set foot in the brothel, but on Sundays, they always go to church as usual to attend mass. She said, "Although the ban on prostitution has been enacted by law, brothel owners will still show their magic powers and continue their mysterious business."

Inside a Paris Brothel Paris brothels are generally divided into three classes. Those on the banks of the Saint-Martin Canal belong to the third class. Upon entering, it is like entering a maze. Once you get used to the smoke, you can see several women sitting and smoking, and men drinking. The customers are mostly black people and Arabs. The madam greets guests very kindly. She leads you to see the bar, the dining room, and the examination room. It is said that prostitutes are examined in the room once a week. She says, "This is really like a women's college. Our girls are forbidden to drink, and their lives are very disciplined." The overnight fee for this type of brothel is six dimes per night.

The customers of mid-range brothels are mostly civil servants and peddlers. The facilities are quite beautiful. If customers are willing, they can check the prostitute's body through a glass door. When checking, customers can see the prostitute, but the prostitute cannot see the customer. The room rent is five dimes per night, and the overnight fee is two dollars and fifty cents.

The luxury of high-end brothels is second to none in the world. For a visitor who has no actual interest in the brothel, the madam's attitude is very arrogant. Many rooms are closed to you. The bar is very luxurious, with carpets, a piano, and a music stage large enough to accommodate an orchestra. In addition, there are elevators and telephone switchboards.

Each room on the second floor is decorated with various bewitching pictures, exposing an orderly set of sins at a glance. One room is decorated like a fine sedan, with windows in the walls, landscape paintings hanging next to the windows, and the room rattling, giving people the sudden feeling of being on a journey. Some rooms have domes built of ice and snow like those of the Eskimos, some are like hunter's tents, and some are like seaside halls.

Here, the room rent is two US dollars per night, and the overnight fee is one hundred US dollars.

Pitiable Ill-Fated Beauties But no matter how enchanting and charming a prostitute is, her income is always pitiful. They are simply slaves of the brothel owners, and brothels are just human flesh markets!

Fortunately, the United Nations has a Commission on the Status of Women, which, under the leadership of Mrs. Roosevelt, is preparing to declare war on prostitution. One of her many tasks is to help women no longer make a living as prostitutes. Those who have already engaged in prostitution should use the education system to break free from the shackles of impurity and engage in legitimate occupations.

Although Paris has now explicitly banned prostitution, the danger lies in the future prevalence of private prostitution, and organizations such as the Prostitutes' Association will also come back to life. In this situation, someone asked Gaston how he would exercise his powers, and he could only smile and not answer.

### Jiang Taigong Is Not Here

— W·W

The execution of Jiang Gongmei, the corrupt official who robbed and embezzled, is truly a catastrophe for the corruption world! The original sentence was only imprisonment, but because Jiang Gongmei was not beautiful, public opinion demanded punishment, all saying he should be killed, and he ended up in such a fate. Young as he was, he dared to commit such a great transgression. Even if Jiang Taigong were here, he could not be reckless in everything. Those fools who have been following his example or are eager to try, can they still dare? Killing one to warn a hundred, we praise the authorities' decisiveness; further, we hope to kill a hundred to warn ten thousand, what harm would that do?

### I Am a "Marker"

— Zhi Hong

I have been a "marker" in the biggest billiard room in the city for more than a year.

I believe that few people care about or know about our lives. Because we are the Boy of upper-class gentlemen! We have to do fourteen hours of work for those wealthy customers every day, from nine in the morning to eleven at night.

Full, full, when others are on vacation, at their happiest time, we are the busiest and least happy. All day long, we hold a stick with a copper frame on the end—a "rest," used when the guest's hand is not long enough. Focused, enduring fatigue. Is the guest hitting red? White? Red goes into the pocket, white goes into the pocket. So we add the scores, three points, five points, seven points, ... The guest is playing a thirty-yuan or fifty-yuan game! We can't add a single point wrong, or we'll get slapped. Occasionally a billiard ball falls into the pocket without being seen, and the guest shouts loudly, "Marker! Pick up the ball!" Scaring you out of your wits.

Others have shifts, but we don't. When it's busy, everyone goes hungry. If you're lucky, the guest doesn't continue playing, and you rush to open the lunch box sent from home, already ice-cold.

If the billiard table opens up while you're eating, you have to put away your eating and add the scores, half-full and half-hungry.

The monthly salary is six thousand yuan, and we remit small accounts of ten thousand. We have never complained that it is too little. Because everyone is a child. Although whenever we take it home, the adults always say, "Tsk, you can't see the sun every day, and you only get six thousand yuan a month."

Yes, the boss only gives us six thousand yuan, we just take our strength and spirit and turn them into small accounts. We also have to be careful of unexpected disasters. One child dropped a billiard ball and had to pay several yuan and was also scolded. Once, a colleague accidentally broke a piece of glass while arranging the cloth, and had to pay for a month of small accounts. He cried until his eyes were red and swollen, so pitiful.

### New Tang Poetry

— Li Xun

Autumn sleep, unaware of dawn, everywhere I hear "theft," a sound of "corruption," how many "cases" have been "solved"?

The two-pronged material case, the grain loan case, have not yet been "solved," and small things like "wharf theft," and big things like "embezzlement by those in charge," are becoming more and more rampant, it can be said that there is no day without them, in the tune of "Spring Dawn," but also "whining without illness."

### A Fine Tale from the Military

— Holy

The 18th anniversary of the Army Military Academy, the principal presided over the ceremony in person, and the guards were students. In the evening, the principal issued a handwritten order: "After 9:00 PM, no officers or soldiers are allowed to enter the school, and they must be locked up in the detention room." Coincidentally, the director of education returned to school at 11:00 PM. The guards stopped the car and did not allow it to enter, because it was an order from the principal. The director of education could not enter. Later, he had to make a phone call elsewhere to report to the principal, and then the principal sent a telegram to the guard commander before he was allowed to pass. This kind of earnest law-abiding is truly worthy of special mention.

According to a National Army comrade who returned from the Northeast, on the front lines in the Northeast, sometimes the National and Communist armies were very close. During ceasefires, National Army soldiers would wave to Communist Army soldiers and say in Sichuan dialect, "Come over here!" Communist Army soldiers would answer in a low voice, "There are guns pointed at our asses behind us!"

During the Battle of Benxi River in the Northeast, Lin Biao (first class of Whampoa) sent a letter to Zhao Gongwu, the commander of the 53rd Army (third class of Whampoa), roughly saying: "Brother Gongwu, if your army cannot capture the Benxi River, then your elder brother and your little brothers will have no foothold in the Northeast; conversely, if you capture it within three days, I will lead all the Communist forces in the Northeast to surrender." Commander Zhao forwarded this letter to Commander Du, who immediately ordered the New Sixth Army to take action. As a result, in less than two days, the Benxi River was captured by the National Army. Commander Du then telegraphed Lin Biao to ask if his promise could be fulfilled. Lin replied in a telegram: "I was just joking with you, why take it so seriously!" Unexpectedly, Lin Biao's bragging was exposed!

"Cultural Exchange"

While the Ministry of Education is considering raising the level of English in universities, it is said that Hong Kong's education will also be reformed, the method is to convert all English schools into primary schools, and use Chinese and English equally in junior high schools; after one year of high school, Chinese and English will be divided into departments, if after graduating from the Chinese department in high school, you can transfer to universities in China, the English department has not been mentioned, probably most of them will be sent to London for "further study." This method was decided after the Hong Kong government and the Ministry of Education "established contact." The purpose is of course to "increase the close connection between Chinese and English culture." In fact? Our generation's English level can already be considered high enough, don't you see that the daughters of the dignified Director ××× are called "Catherine" and "Louise"? Now that the education authorities are planning to raise it again, probably our next generation will have no time to learn the countless Chinese characters in the "Thousand Character Classic" and "Hundred Family Surnames." Although the Hong Kong government knows that it is a small area, it does not want to lag behind others in "increasing cultural connections," fearing that Chinese people's English level will be too good and forget their own Chinese, so it particularly emphasizes Chinese teaching, and then sends them to China to "study" English, this shows international friendship, really great.

Crowd Psychology

Chinese people who read "Water Margin" will probably have two kinds of psychological reactions after reading it: one is that in a peaceful era, the reader's social environment is national security, people are prosperous, and each person's economic life does not feel a serious threat, even if some people like Cai Jing and Gao Qiu appear at that time, domineering and selfish, manipulating power and stealing power, messing around in the government, everyone can more or less silently forgive them, and think that the actions of the Liangshan rebels who rob homes and kill people are superfluous, and even annoying. The other is that in a chaotic era, the reader's social environment is political derailment, greed and corruption are rampant, especially when they feel in life that "why take everything as much as possible, and use it like mud and sand," they feel that those "Black Whirlwind" and "Leopard Head" figures are kind and lovable; at the moment when some corrupt officials and bureaucrats unscrupulously reach out to them, they can't wait to pounce on them like Li Kui and "bite off your flesh," but? The impossible result in fact increases their longing for the Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness. When "Desert Serenade" was screened, the scene where Dennis Morgan led hundreds of warriors on horseback down the mountain, robbing and killing the Burger and capturing Dabucha, the audience cheered for the bandits for completing the task of eliminating violence and bringing peace, isn't this a bright and shining mirror of the most realistic administration?

The Same Throughout History

Recently, rereading Romance of the Three Kingdoms, I found that Zhuge Liang has many small gimmicks, and the skills of coping with the world today, two or three thousand years later, are actually not without similarities. For example, in the Battle of Xinye, where Liu Bei was defeated, he relied on a mouth that could turn clouds and rain, inciting Sun Cao to fight each other, occupying Jingzhou without bloodshed, and as a result, he angered Zhou Yu to death; he even went to Caisang Port in a light carriage, prostrated himself on the ground, crying to death; those Jiangdong yokels, the idiots who were originally prepared to avenge their master, were also moved to put their swords back into their sheaths, and sighed: "Kong Ming is affectionate, Gong Jin is too short-tempered." Who knew that a sentence would become the "Treasure Mirror for Serving the World" for those adults and gentlemen who regard themselves as "noble and upright" and desperately want to "perfect the ancients and moderns." Usually, when they encounter two friends in difficult circumstances who come to them for help, even if they have a good relationship with the family, they often move enough to embarrass them with their status and airs, but once this friend dies in poverty and sorrow, they write elegiac couplets, send wreaths, and cry sadly at the memorial service: "We used to be friends who were like horns, sharing our liver and gallbladder!" People on the sidelines will naturally praise his enthusiasm a few times; so those filial sons and virtuous grandsons who feed their old mothers with coarse food and even abandon the lives of their dear mothers for the sake of their pampered wives, will specially invite celebrities to write "unfilial sins are profound" "showing this behavior," and wait with peace of mind for their parents to cross the crane to the west. Historians have painted a big picture of Zhuge Liang's various deceptions and schemes, so naturally today's society cannot but recognize the continuation of this historical tradition. Amitabha!
