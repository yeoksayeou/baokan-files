### Marshal and Ambassador Stuart Decide to Continue Efforts for Peace in China; Government to Express its Position on the Current Situation and the Anping Incident; President Song, US Ambassador, and Others to Return to Nanjing Today

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 10:30 AM on the 5th, holding a long talk for two hours. Special Envoy Marshall and his wife invited President Chiang and his wife, along with President Song Ziwen and his daughter, to dinner at his residence at 7:30 PM on the evening of the 5th, after which they watched a Hollywood movie together.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Marshall is scheduled to return to Nanjing around Wednesday or Thursday. Both he and Ambassador Stuart indicated that they will return to Kuling within a few days.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] According to reliable sources, Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have maintained a calm and fair attitude towards the Anping Incident since it occurred. They have also compiled reports based on reports from the U.S. military in North China and other sources, and submitted them to the Washington authorities. Instructions are expected to arrive within a few days. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart plan to issue a statement after arriving in Nanjing based on these instructions.

[Central News Agency, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] The U.S. Marines were ambushed by the Communist Party in Anping on the Tianjin-Beijing highway, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. So far, only the word "regret" has been received from the Communist Party. It is reported that Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are not deterred by this from their arduous journey to seek peace in China. They will continue to build upon the fragile foundation of negotiations prior to the Anping Incident, sparing no effort to achieve success. Marshal Marshall remains in Kuling, while the ambassador will fly to Nanjing on the 6th to realize this noble ideal.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart, at 5:00 PM on the 5th, paid a visit to President Chiang, accompanied by Mr. Fu Jingbo. This was the Ambassador's second meeting with President Chiang after climbing the mountain twice. The conversation lasted until 6:20 PM, covering the Anping Incident and the future of peace in China. The Ambassador is scheduled to descend the mountain and return to Nanjing on the morning of the 6th. According to Mr. Fu Jingbo, who told reporters that the Ambassador will stay in Nanjing for a few days and then return to Kuling.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] President Chiang summoned President Song Ziwen for a long talk at his residence at noon on the 5th, then had lunch with his wife, Madame Song, and Song's daughter. President Song is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 6th.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Minister of Information Peng Xuepei is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 6th with Advisor Bell. The originally scheduled reception for journalists in Kuling on the 7th, to announce the government's solemn attitude toward the current situation and the Anping Incident, will be moved to Nanjing.

[Central News Agency, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Foreign authorities here received news from Washington that the general reaction of American public opinion to the ambush of U.S. Marines by the CCP on the Tianjin-Beijing highway in Anping, threatening the White House to immediately withdraw its U.S. troops stationed in China, is a clumsy mistake. Opinion in Kuling believes that the Anping Incident symbolizes the CCP's threat to peace in China and the Far East. The most directly affected parties are President Truman's statement on China, General Marshall's mission in China, Ambassador Stuart's courageous actions, and the National Government's efforts to seek peace since July. However, both the Chinese and American governments must avoid emotional excitement regarding the Anping Incident, abandon appeasement, and continue to strive for their peace policy. On the one hand, they must be prepared for international pirate-like atrocities, and on the other hand, they must guide the CCP's illegal activities into legal channels, ensuring that the CCP's attempt to rebel comprehensively is impossible and that it cannot isolate itself from the nation.

### Admiral Kirk Flies to Qingdao; Details Anping Incident Before Leaving Shanghai Yesterday, Saying the Truth is Still Under Investigation

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 5th Dispatch] Admiral Kirk, accompanied by his wife and son, flew from Shanghai to Qingdao at 5:30 PM on the 5th.

[Our Newspaper Report] Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Fleet in China, left Shanghai yesterday afternoon for Qingdao. Before leaving, he hosted reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city at the Cathay Hotel, reporting on the "Anping Incident." He believed that the CCP's news agencies repeatedly accused the "U.S. Marines of attacking the 53rd Regiment of the Communist Army," which sufficiently proved who was responsible for the incident. At the beginning of his report, Admiral Kirk first pointed out that the U.S. military's mission in China was to assist in restoring a peaceful state in China. For this purpose, the U.S. Marines maintained regular traffic between Beijing and Tianjin, once every two weeks, to deliver supplies to the Beiping Military Mediation Department and the U.S. military there.

"In some areas along this highway," Kirk declared, "there has always been the presence of the Communist Army. The attack on the U.S. military supply convoy occurred when it was passing through that section of the road."

According to Admiral Kirk's detailed report on the Anping Incident, the main body of the convoy consisted of twelve trucks, each weighing 12.5 tons and fully loaded with military equipment and food, one truck from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), three U.S. military officers in another vehicle, and a lead convoy consisting of two jeeps and two one-ton scout cars, all equipped with automatic rifles and machine guns. At 12:20 PM on the 29th of last month, the lead convoy arrived near Anping and saw two oxcarts blocking the road. U.S. troops immediately got out of the vehicles to investigate the obstacles. At this moment, a hand grenade suddenly flew over, followed by five or six more. Colonel Kerwin, the U.S. officer in charge of the convoy, was killed instantly, one Marine was killed, and twelve were injured. One more Marine died from his injuries that evening.

At the same time as the hand grenade explosions, rifle fire was directed at the U.S. troops from both sides of the road. Machine guns were also firing from a village about 300 yards from the road. A fierce battle lasted for four hours. A white flag then appeared in the village. The U.S. military sent three people to investigate, but one of them was shot and killed. Fortunately, the attackers finally stopped firing and left.

Admiral Kirk estimated that the attacking force consisted of more than 300 people, most of whom were wearing gray Communist army uniforms and Japanese army caps left behind by the Japanese army. If there were any, at least three had been killed, and the number of wounded must have been higher.

Subsequently, the reporters asked questions. Based on Admiral Kirk's answers, the following can be summarized: (1) The U.S. Marines are still traveling back and forth on the highway between Beiping and Tianjin, transporting food and supplies. (2) The truth about the Anping Incident is still under investigation, but no protests have been lodged with Yan'an. (3) Except for the Northeast, the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war is almost complete. (4) The total number of U.S. Marines in China is between 22,000 and 23,000, but he did not comment on the rumors of an imminent withdrawal.

[Our City News] Admiral Kirk said that the Anping Incident involving the U.S. military was being handled by Special Envoy Marshall. He solemnly stated that if such an incident were to happen again in the future, the U.S. military would retaliate in self-defense. He also said that the U.S. military would not change its consistent position because of this. There are a total of sixteen U.S. warships in Qingdao, and eight have already been handed over to the Chinese Navy.

### U.S. Troops in Tianjin Attacked Again

[Reuters, Tianjin, 5th Dispatch] This morning, a U.S. officer was driving back to the East Barracks and was shot at when passing over the iron bridge. The U.S. Marines reportedly went to investigate and were ambushed on the way back. Many shots were fired, and the U.S. Marines took cover, so there were no deaths or injuries.

[Another Dispatch] This morning, machine gun fire was heard in the eastern district of Tianjin, believed to be beyond the Beining Railway.

### After the Anping Incident, National Army Has Garrisoned Xianghe; Local Communist Army Changed Unit Designations and Fled

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] The Communist army in Xianghe City, aware that the National Army would inevitably garrison the city after the unfortunate incidents in Da Xia Sha He, withdrew its entire army on the afternoon of the 3rd, and the political workers also withdrew at the same time. The requisitioned grain and fodder were all transported to Pinggu. The National Army then entered the city. The Beijing-Tianjin highway will thus be substantially secured. It is reported that in July, seven business-operated vehicles and vehicles from the Highway Bureau were seized by the Communist army on the Beijing-Tianjin highway. The Communist army claimed that all wheat or legal tender exceeding 100,000 yuan would be confiscated. Xiao Ke, commander of the Communist army's Ji-Re-Liao Military Region, protested to the U.S. through the CCP representatives at the Military Mediation Department regarding the Da Xia Sha He incident, claiming that U.S. troops had attacked the Communist army and providing four items as attachments: 1. U.S. troops dispatched armed U.S. soldiers to Xianghe three times in February and March to discuss repairing the Beijing-Tianjin highway with the Communist army. 2. On March 29, six armed U.S. soldiers shot and killed Yin Shizhong, staff officer of the 18th military sub-district of the Communist army, at Jiancun on the Beijing-Tianjin highway. 3. On April 1, five armed U.S. soldiers fired at the Communist army positions south of Matouzhen, Xianghe.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] News from transportation circles: More than 1,000 Communist troops attacked Yangcun Railway Station on the Beijing-Tianjin Railway at 10:00 PM last night. They retreated after a fierce battle of three hours. Although the Communist army from Xianghe withdrew, more than 3,000 Communist troops newly arrived from Jizhong have been deployed to Yangcun, Wuqing, and other places. It is reported that their purpose is to confront the National Army and ensure the Beijing-Tianjin transportation plan.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 4th Dispatch] It is widely believed that the Communist army's attack on the U.S. military on the Beijing-Tianjin highway has complex underlying motives. It is rumored that the U.S. military does not consider this incident closed. It is reported that the Communist army held an anti-American rally in Da Xia Sha He, the location of the incident, on the 25th. Four days later, the incident occurred. The Communist army unit involved in the incident was the 14th Regiment, which has now been reorganized into special task battalions and has fled Xianghe.

### Zhou Zhirou Arrives in Kuling; Reports to President on Dispatching Planes to Yan'an; Shows Photos to Reporters Explaining the Facts

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] General Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, arrived in Kuling at 6:00 PM today and stayed at Room 65 of the Xianyan Hotel at No. 94 Zhonglu. He then met with reporters from newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jiujiang at 6:30 PM, confirming that the Air Force had sent planes to Yan'an to bomb and destroy the detained plane. Zhou came to Kuling to report on this matter to President Chiang. He originally planned to stay for a few days, but due to pressing matters in Nanjing, he will return to Nanjing within a day or two. Zhou brought enlarged versions of photos taken at an altitude of 2,000 meters over the Yan'an airport after the plane was destroyed. He asked Minister Peng Xuepei to show them to the reporters at the Xianyan Hotel tonight to explain the facts. The photos were very clear. The Yan'an airport, with an 800-meter runway, was located in a small, desolate valley, and the detained plane was parked 200 meters away from the airport. Peng stated that the government's sole purpose in sending planes to Yan'an was to destroy the detained plane, so no other losses or injuries were caused except for the plane itself. The motive for destroying the plane was for the sake of a peaceful future, because the Communist Party had been constantly abusing the weapons it had taken from the enemy and puppets after the Japanese surrender, and oppressing the people. Chinese and foreign people in Kuling have agreed to this point, believing that this action was normal.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Regarding the "Bombing of Yan'an," the Communist Party will use this as a major propaganda point. Zhou Enlai is currently drafting a so-called "protest statement," which has not yet been completed. The method of delivery is also unknown.

### Minister Bai Returns to Nanjing; Completes Inspection in Henan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi flew to Xinxiang by special plane a few days ago and stayed for several days.

After reorganization, the quality and combat effectiveness of the National Army have improved, and their morale is high. They are particularly interested in technical training. Bai was very satisfied with the results of the inspection.

### Communist Army Offensive in Su-Lu-Wan Thwarted; National Army Advancing in Various Counties; Military Official Describes Recent Situation

[Qi Bao, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Due to the intense military conflict between the National Army and the Communist Army in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui, we interviewed a military official to clarify the situation. The following is a detailed account of the recent war situation in that area:

National Army's Right Wing Advances on Two Routes

The National Army's right wing in northern Jiangsu, after recapturing Haian on the evening of the 2nd, is now advancing north on two routes. One route is advancing beyond Xiyang directly towards Libao, and the other route is advancing beyond Wangjiazhuang towards Fuan, which will cooperate with the National Army in Qintong to directly attack Dongtai. The main force of the Communist Army's New 1st Division has retreated to the Anfeng Liangdu area, resisting the National Army advancing north from Haian. The Communist Army's 6th Division and the 55th, 57th, and 61st Regiments of Liu Peishan's 7th Column have all withdrawn to the Mojiazhuang area, which the National Army is sweeping up. The National Army in Taixian crossed the port and Zou Zhuang by waterway, and after a fierce battle in Fudu, finally recaptured the Communist stronghold of Laoge. The area is 72 li from Taixian and 18 li from Zou Zhuang, and has great military value, as it can attack Sanduo Er Gou Yi Gou to the west, threatening Gaoyou, and can cooperate with the National Army in Shenjia directly to capture Dongtai.

Dongtai and Xinghua May Fall Soon

It is reported that the National Army's vanguard, after clearing the Communist Army near Laoge, advanced north, attacking the Shiliting at the gateway to Xinghua (10 li from Xinghua), and pointed northwest to control Sanlangmiao. Another army moved west, seized Da Duozhuang Henggang. Therefore, the Communist armies in Xinghua and Dongtai are already besieged by the National Army and may fall soon. The highway from Nantong to Rugao is unobstructed, and the highway from Rugao to Taixian is being repaired day and night. The highway from Yangzhou to Yizheng has been thoroughly destroyed by the Communist Army, so it will take some time before traffic can resume. The Communist Army Headquarters in Huaiyin is trying to salvage the precarious situation in the south and has sent Zhang Yunyi, Deputy Commander of the New Fourth Army, to lead his troops south along the Grand Canal, reaching Shaobo and counterattacking Xiannvmiao. Part of the force landed in Sishui and headed along the highway to Xinghua and Dongtai to reinforce. It is expected that an unprecedented battle will break out south of Dongtai in the coming days.

National Army in Yangzhou Takes Advantage of Pursuit

The National Army in Yangzhou advanced along the Yang-Tian highway, recapturing Yangshouba and Sungongpu on the morning of the 3rd. Taking advantage of the situation, they pursued northwest and recaptured Dayiji on the 4th. Qinlan is already under the control of the National Army. The Yang-Tian highway will be open to traffic in due time. The Communist Army's Ganquan troops are currently gathering in the Gongdaoqiao Songjiaqiao area, all wearing civilian clothes, attempting to steal an attack on Yangzhou. The National Army in the Dayiji area and the National Army's left wing in northern Jiangsu, after capturing Xuyi and Tianchang, have advanced to Gaoyou and the Hongze Lake waterway. Part of the force crossed the river and entered Jiangba, pointing along the Hongze Lake Dam to Shunheji, which will cooperate with the National Army moving south from Suqian to encircle Siyang. The National Army advancing north from Suqian crossed Zhangzhuang and reached Shaodian, confronting the Communist Army across the Shuhe River. It will join forces with the National Army moving south from Xin'an and then jointly attack Shuyang, so that the Communist Army west of the Shuhe River, south of the Longhai Railway, east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and north of Suqian and Suining will be isolated.

Communist Army in Southern Shandong Attempts Reinforcement

After defeating eight regiments of the Communist Army, the National Army in Xuzhou is advancing southeast, starting to clear the Communist Army south of the Longhai Railway and gathering near Shuanggou. The Communist Army in Shandong Province has transferred more than 10,000 reinforcements from Feixian, Linyi, and Yixian, and is advancing along the Zaozhuang branch line, via the Taierzhuang Canal Station, to Shuyang, attempting to cooperate with the Communist Army in Guanyun to encircle Donghai and Xin'an, and maintain communications between Jiangsu and Shandong. In order to crush this Communist Army attempt, the National Army has transferred heavy troops from Xuzhou, advancing to Taierzhuang to cut off the canal highway at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong, so that the Communist Army moving south from Shandong will be blocked north of Taierzhuang, daring not to cross the line. The Communist Army has now fled to the Chexi Mountain Taohuaqiao area, still attempting to steal across the canal, cross the Longhai Railway, and reinforce northern Jiangsu.

Battle of Dangshan About to Break Out

Furthermore, the National Army in Dangshan, west of Xuzhou, is facing the main force of the Communist Army, and the battle is about to break out. The situation has reached an unprecedentedly tense stage. The Communist armies in Jining, Jiaxiang, Juye, Chengwu, and Heze counties in western Shandong are currently crossing Jinxiang, Dingtao, Chengw, and heading toward Shanxian, which will cooperate with the Communist armies in Yixian and Caoxian, as well as the Communist Army in Yongcheng in the豫境south of the Longhai Railway, to encircle Dangshan from all sides. Fierce battles are underway in Xiayi. There are now no fewer than 20,000 Communist troops gathered near Dangshan, including Yang Yong's eight regiments and Song Renqiong's more than 10,000 troops.

### Li and Wen Case to be Announced Today; Rumors in Kunming that Yang Lide Has Died

(2) Senior party, government, military, and educational personnel in Yunnan held a symposium in the provincial government on the evening of the 4th.

### Communist Army in Northeast Transports Reinforcements to Shandong

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 5th Dispatch] Military news: The two brigades belonging to Xiao Hua's Liaodong Military Region Communist Army in the Dandong, Fengcheng, Xiuyan, Zhuanghe, and Gaiping areas have recently been ordered to concentrate near Qingbangzi, about 60 li northeast of Zhuanghe, and are being transported in batches by sailboats from Zhuanghe and Zhiyuankou, southwest of Zhuanghe, to Yantai. The transportation continues unabated, seemingly to reinforce Shandong.

### Communist Troops Fiercely Attack the Outskirts of Xuzhou; Intense Fighting is Ongoing; Northern Jiangsu is Quiet, the Hai-Tai Highway Should Be Open to Traffic

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 5th] This morning, communist troops reinforced their forces and fiercely attacked the Shuanggou and Zhaoyangji area on the outskirts of Xuzhou. The battle was fierce. By noon, after the National Army counterattacked with their full strength, the communist offensive was thwarted. The battle is still ongoing.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Military sources report that when the National Army recovered Hai'an, several communist officers led more than 300 soldiers to surrender to us, bringing with them more than 30 light machine guns and many rifles, indicating the communist army's morale is low. Furthermore, in the intense battle of Xuzhou, the communist forces mobilized a total of 58,000 troops.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 5th] Today, this reporter accompanied Huang Baitao, commander of the reorganized 25th Division, Zhang Jichuan, magistrate of Jiangdu County, and others to inspect Yingtian Road after its recovery and to comfort the people. The highway was severely damaged by the communist troops, with a pit every ten steps. It was difficult to pass beyond Ganquan Mountain. Commander Huang and others convened the people in Ganquan Town to comfort them, explaining three points: (1) Old debts will not be settled; everyone should live and work in peace. (2) People returning from the city are not allowed to bully those in the countryside. (3) Those who were forced to serve the communist troops will not be investigated further. The people returned en masse after the National Army arrived. Everyone was moved to tears upon hearing this. The market is rapidly recovering.

[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 5th] The fighting here is quiet. A small number of militia harassed the vicinity of Qutang. The Hai-Tai Highway should be open to traffic within two days.

### The Communist Troops' Retreat Westward is a Pre-planned Scheme; They Should Be Ordered to Withdraw from Shaanxi Province; Liu Zhi and Zhu Shaozhou Issue Statements

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th] Regarding the westward retreat of the "Central Plains Military Region" troops of the Communist Army, and the repeated accusations from the Communist side against the National Army, Director Liu Zhi of the Pacification Headquarters here issued a statement to reporters, strongly refuting these accusations. He stated that in April, the Communist Party requested that the "Central Plains Military Region" Communist troops be moved to northern Jiangsu, citing a shortage of food in the area as the reason. The Wuhan Headquarters then borrowed 40 million yuan to purchase food, and the matter was settled. Unexpectedly, on May 2nd, the Communist representative, Mu Dingyi, claimed: "The 60,000 troops of the Central Plains Military Region under Li Xiannian are near Xuanhua Town and are being surrounded and attacked by 26 divisions of the government with 300,000 troops in four routes." Consequently, on the 7th of the same month, Minister Xu Yongchang, Communist representative Zhou Enlai, and American representative General Beedle Smith went to Xuanhua Town to inspect, and the result was that nothing of the sort had occurred, which is known to the world. At the same time as this southern incident, the situation in the Northeast was also well known. The Communist Party's request to move the "Central Plains Military Region" Communist troops to northern Jiangsu, which borders Shandong, was a base for communist disruption in the Northeast. It was a clear attempt to place these communist troops on a springboard to the Northeast, with the greatest conspiracy. The authorities refused their request because, on the one hand, they did not want to exacerbate the chaos in the Northeast, and on the other hand, they wished to implement military reorganization within the existing garrison areas according to Order No. 3. This painstaking effort was not understood by the Communist Party even after the situation in the Northeast gradually eased. On June 29th, the "Central Plains Military Region" Communist troops crossed the railway and retreated westward, poisoning the borders of Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan. Two points should be especially emphasized here. First, a month before this incident, Han Dongshan's troops of the "Central Plains Military Region" Communist Army had already retreated westward. The Hankou group held several rounds of consultations to urge the communists to return to their original garrison area, but to no avail, which clearly showed their unwillingness to abide by the agreement. Second, during this incident, the "Jianghan Military Region" Communist Army, originally stationed in the Qing'an area, and the communist troops pre-positioned near Xinyang, rose up in response and retreated westward together. This indicates a pre-planned operation. The "Central Plains Military Region" Communist troops initially requested to move to northern Jiangsu and ultimately retreated westward. At first hearing, it seems incomprehensible, but in reality, it is a consistent action, aiming to create widespread internal chaos. When they requested to move to northern Jiangsu, they intended to aggravate the turmoil in the Northeast, and then trigger a nationwide war. Now, their retreat towards the borders of Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan is aimed at attracting all the National Army in the Central Plains to this treacherous mountainous area, in order to achieve their ambition of launching internal chaos at any time. Although the circumstances and timing are different, their intentions to undermine peace are consistent. However, the communist troops attacked the National Army and local defense forces along the way, and for self-defense, they had to retaliate, resulting in casualties. Moreover, many subordinates of the Communist Party are extremely dissatisfied with their treacherous and treasonous acts and have voluntarily defected. Therefore, those who retreated to the areas of Shanyang and Zhushan on the border of Shaanxi and Hubei numbered less than 4,000 in total.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] Since the arrival of the Ninth and Thirty-second Groups in Xi'an, the mediation efforts have attracted much attention from all parties. This reporter visited Chairman Zhu Shaozhou on the 4th to inquire about this matter. Zhu stated that he had not yet met with the representatives of the groups, but regarding Li Xiannian's troops' incursion into Shaanxi, Zhu stated that since the Military Affairs Commission ordered Shaanxi Province in 1940 to designate Yan'an and ten other counties in northern Shaanxi as the food collection area for the Eighteenth Group Army, the remaining counties were not garrisoned by the Communist Army. During the War of Resistance, no inch of land in this province fell into enemy hands, and the National and Communist armies did not fight the enemy in the province, which is completely different from other provinces with so-called liberated areas. This time, Li's troops disobeyed orders and entered Shaanxi without authorization, disrupting peace, and there is no justification for it. The executive groups should notify Li Xiannian himself and his subordinates to leave Shaanxi within a time limit, in accordance with the provisions of the Political Consultative Conference's military reorganization plan, so that the people of Shaanxi will not suffer from their calamity. I have followed the Supreme Authority's intentions of seeking peace through compromise and have telegraphed all county magistrates to protect the people and await a resolution.

### Communist Troops Ravage Counties in Hubei and Anhui; Authorities are Preparing for Emergency Relief; Public Servants and Educators in Anhui Province Donate Salaries for Relief

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] Anlu, Yingcheng, Huang'an, Yingshan, Qingfu, and Lishan counties have been ravaged by the communist troops for the longest time and have suffered the most. Now that the communist troops have retreated westward, these counties have been recovered one after another. The central government, concerned about the suffering of the disaster victims, has ordered the authorities here to use the recovered supplies to quickly provide emergency relief to the disaster areas.

[Central News Agency, Hefei, 5th] After more than ten counties in northeastern Anhui were occupied by the communist troops, the people fled in large numbers. Currently, more than a million people are stranded in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and in Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places. The situation is extremely miserable. Various agencies and organizations in the provincial capital have decided to establish a refugee relief association and set up branches in various places to conduct fundraising. Public servants and educators throughout the province will donate salaries: five days' salary for those in senior positions, two days' salary for those in intermediate positions, and one day's salary for those in junior positions. The provincial government will first advance 50 million yuan for emergency relief.

### The Ministry of National Defense Executed Corrupt Naval Officer Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense executed corrupt naval officer Zhou Guangzu on the 5th. Zhou was 62 years old. In December 1945, he took advantage of his position to sell 312 barrels of heavy oil and 246 barrels of machine oil under his custody, obtaining more than two million yuan, which he spent. After a clear military trial, he was sentenced to death and deprived of public office for life.

### Aerial Observation of Northern Jiangsu; The Reality of Communist Troops Damming the River; Thousands of Miles of Flooded Land is Heartbreaking

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The actual situation of the communist troops damming the river in northern Jiangsu, according to the results obtained from aerial observation, is as follows: (1) Near the Grand Canal in Xin'an Town, southwest of Haizhou, a huge breach 30 meters wide was seen, with floodwaters pouring straight down. (2) The breach of the Houmu River north of Shuyang is very large. The river surface and the land are merged into one, with thousands of miles of flooded land. Only the small highland of Qinglong Mountain is exposed. Residents have brought their belongings to the only rooftops and are temporarily living there. (3) The breach at the Grand Canal station on the Longhai Line near Xuzhou is the same situation as above. (4) The water level in the area west of Gaoyou Lake near the northeastern corner of Tianchang is flooded, possibly due to a breach upstream, or due to flooding of the waters of Hongze Lake and Gaoyou Lake. However, the water is turbulent, houses are drifting, and it is heartbreaking to witness. If the water level continues to rise, the disaster will be even more unthinkable.

### Supplies Stored in Shanghai Warehouses; The UNRRA is Intensifying Clearance; The Problem of Inland Transport is Also Being Vigorously Improved

[Our Newspaper Report] A spokesman for the UNRRA stated that UNRRA has not yet received any notification regarding the cancellation of the order issued on July 9th to suspend the shipment of supplies to China. However, UNRRA has decided to clear the heavy machinery and building materials stored in the warehouses in this city. UNRRA personnel responsible for managing the docks and warehouses are working day and night to intensify their work. The factory where UNRRA assembles this machinery is also operating day and night. Most of this machinery is surplus military equipment that has been used, and it takes a lot of effort to repair. It is especially difficult when parts are incomplete, so they have to be manufactured themselves or even re-ordered from abroad. After the assembly is complete at UNRRA's machine factory inside Jinan University in Zhenru, it is very difficult to transport the machinery because of its huge weight.

Regarding the inland transport of supplies, the spokesman pointed out that in the past, UNRRA faced many technical difficulties in carrying out this work. Beforehand, they did not know when the cargo ship would arrive, and they often had no idea what kind of supplies were being loaded. Therefore, UNRRA has requested UNRRA Director Ruggardiyar to remedy this, and reforms are being vigorously sought here. UNRRA has now agreed to notify the UNRRA Washington office of all relevant information each time a shipment is made. All food, transportation equipment, and machinery are inspected by UNRRA personnel before shipment, and then a certificate guaranteeing the suitability of the goods is delivered to the UNRRA office in China, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past of damaged supplies and unusable machinery. In addition, in order to avoid congestion of supplies at Shanghai docks, UNRRA is considering using smaller ships so that unloading can also be done at smaller docks.

Flooding Disaster in Zhengyangguan, 100,000 Acres of Farmland Submerged

[Our Newspaper Zhengyangguan Correspondence] Since the beginning of summer, heavy rain has been pouring down, coupled with the overflowing of the Yellow River and simultaneous mountain torrents, causing the water level to rise sharply by fifteen to sixteen feet. The flooding is most severe in areas such as Fuyang, Yingshang, Huoqiu, Fengtai, Shouxian in northern Anhui, and Zhengyangguan, a point of communication between Huai and Ying.

Mr. Wang Wenzhong, a member of the Locust Control Work Team of the Anhui Special Envoy Branch of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Minguang from Bengbu to preside over and supervise the public in the work of eradicating locust nymphs. The work has already been launched and is being handled.

Ningbo: Proposal to the Central Government to Establish Siming County

The Siming Mountains, which are adjacent to the three counties of Yin (county), Fenghua, and Cixi in the sixth district and the four counties of Yuyao, Shangyu, Xinchang, and Sheng (county) in the third district, cover a vast area with overlapping mountains. Bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, and the people who suffer from their poison are innumerable. It is inconvenient for each county to govern. I sincerely fear that if this continues, the future of public security will be worrying. The provincial government previously proposed to open up another county to facilitate governance. It ordered the commissioners of the third and sixth districts to survey the situation and prepare a plan for review. Now, it has been approved by the Provincial Administrative Conference to decide to open up another county. It is recommended to the Central Government to name it Siming County. Before it is approved, a pacification agency may be established first, and the commissioners of the third and sixth districts have already been ordered to conduct a long-term survey and prepare a plan for review.

### Wang Jingwei's Eldest Son's Case of Joining the Enemy: Trial Opened Yesterday at the Nanjing High Court; Confessed to Joining the Enemy Due to "Father-Son Relationship"

Editorial

### The New Significance of Promoting Domestic Goods

In today's Shanghai market, which is flooded with imported goods, the national goods promotion parade and the promotion of domestic goods movement jointly organized by our newspaper and more than 40 major manufacturers are launched at this moment, and their significance is profound. Using domestic goods is originally the national duty of the people. This not only suffices to block the alarming annual trade deficit, but also suffices to support the development of our infant industry. We have had a movement to promote domestic goods not only since today, but our promotion of domestic goods today is in fact deeply urgent. Due to the unrest in the domestic situation and the influx of foreign goods, China's domestic goods production industry is facing an unprecedented crisis. Today, our promotion of domestic goods is not only to awaken us to the habit of using domestic goods, but also to awaken us to pay attention to the current crisis in our country, to think of ways to resolve these crises, and to enable our infant industry to develop healthily. In other words, today our promotion of domestic goods is not entirely aimed at promoting the consumption of domestic goods, but more at improving the production of domestic goods.

To improve the production of our domestic goods, in a negative sense, we must eliminate all factors that hinder the improvement of domestic goods production. In a positive sense, we must create all the favorable conditions that enable the production of domestic goods to be improved. Under the extremely unfavorable conditions of numerous obstacles to domestic goods production, the shrinking and stagnation of the domestic goods production industry may lead our entire infant national industry to extinction. By that time, it may be too late for us to promote domestic goods again. Therefore, today we promote domestic goods, we must especially create a good and healthy environment for the domestic goods production industry so that it can grow and develop.

Indeed, the various obstacles that stand in the way of today's domestic goods production industry are mainly inseparable from the survival of the entire Chinese nation. The communist party's separation and rebellion have made it impossible for domestic transportation to recover smoothly, which affects the circulation of commercial goods. The unrest in the local areas has also reduced the consumption of domestic goods. In addition, the instability of currency values ​​and the massive dumping of foreign goods have all made the domestic goods production industry face serious difficulties. The resolution of these crises must be sought in the clarification of the overall situation. Only when the overall situation in China can be bright and stable can China's domestic goods production industry be bright and stable. Therefore, when we call for the resolution of the crisis in the domestic goods production industry, the first thing we think of is the communist party's military problem. Because of the communist party's obstruction, transportation has not recovered and a unified situation has not been achieved. As a result, the government has not been able to fundamentally resolve the current economic crisis, such as the consolidation of the monetary system, etc., so that domestic economic life can gradually become stable. We can understand why the government has not been able to take any active measures to fundamentally resolve the current economic crisis.

However, understanding that the government has not been able to take any active measures to fundamentally resolve the current economic crisis does not exonerate the government from its responsibilities. Some of the current crises are indeed related to the overall situation, but some crises indicate that the government lacks a firm policy and that the government's measures are inappropriate. In the latter case, we see that the imported goods, especially luxury consumer goods, that flood the domestic market are sufficient to indicate that the government does not have a policy to protect domestic industry, resulting in cheap and high-quality imported goods flooding the market. Today, when we promote domestic goods, the first thing we want to ask the government is to clearly define a policy to protect domestic industry and make good use of it. At present, in order to protect our infant industry, our international trade must not be completely left to its freedom, and strict control should be adopted. The government has already used tariff policies to prohibit the import of certain luxury goods, but some non-essential goods that are not listed as luxury goods are now flooding in large quantities, and even with the addition of tariffs and freight, they are still lower than the cost of domestically produced goods. Under such circumstances, how can domestic goods industry not suffocate to death? Due to the excessively high domestic production costs, the crackdown on this type of imported goods can no longer be completely carried out using tariff policies. In the case of ad valorem taxation, because the price of the goods themselves is low, even with the addition of high import taxes with a crackdown meaning, they are still cheaper than domestic goods, resulting in the failure to achieve the practical effect of the crackdown. We cannot allow this situation to develop naturally for a long time.

Secondly, what makes our production industry feel difficult is the excessively high bank discount interest, which makes it impossible for them to breathe. The operation of the production business, from the purchase of raw materials to the sale of finished products, requires the turnover of working capital in every aspect. In the current situation where the discount interest is one or even two jiao or more, how can the production business not feel shrunken? In supporting our domestic goods production industry, we hope that the government can effectively crack down on usury so that they can lend necessary funds at lower interest rates, so that the production business can gradually become lively.

All of the above, such as the crackdown on usury and the control of import trade, are originally things that the government should do. In the current stage where the domestic situation has not yet been clarified, if we want to rectify the current economic crisis, get to the root of the problem, and make thorough improvements, it may not be allowed by the situation. However, measures to treat the symptoms cannot be delayed. Leaving a little vitality for the domestic goods production industry is leaving a little vitality for the national economy.

### Regulations Committee Engaged in Heated Debate; Voting System Still Undecided; British Compromise Plan Rejected by Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 5th Broadcasting: If no decision can be made on the voting issue at the meeting this afternoon, the Chairman of the Regulations Committee, Spaak, will allow another meeting to be held tonight. All representatives feel that procedural issues must be resolved quickly in order to start the main work of the peace conference. In today's debate, the Soviet Union and its supporting countries demanded a two-thirds voting method, but the British amendment, which provides that some issues be passed by two-thirds and others by a majority, is likely to be accepted in the end.

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 5th Broadcasting: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today rejected the British compromise plan on the voting issue, believing that this violated the resolution of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He believes that it is necessary to follow the two-thirds majority principle, but proposed that the delegations of various countries have the right to make recommendations to the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

[Our Newspaper] London, 5th Broadcasting: At the Regulations Committee, the New Zealand representative, Jordan, gave a sarcastic speech, saying: "If the conference adopts a two-thirds majority voting system, then the great powers do not have to talk about democracy, because this voting system is enough to prevent the conference from achieving anything. If this method is adopted, then we might as well pack our bags and go home." The representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland followed the representatives of Yugoslavia in making speeches, supporting the two-thirds voting system, but the representatives of New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands, Australia, and Brazil all expressed their opposition. The British representative put forward a compromise amendment, which was seconded by the US representative. If Molotov insists on the original proposal, he is likely to fail. Bernaldez asked the four major powers to hold a foreign ministers' conference at the same time to consider the draft treaty recommendations at the peace conference immediately to avoid delays.

[Reuters] Paris, 4th: Regarding the majority voting issue, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt has expressed his opposition to the compromise plan put forward by the United Kingdom. Mr. Evatt told Reuters that this is tantamount to giving the four major powers a veto power. In other words, motions that are not agreed to by the four major powers cannot be accepted by the conference. This is the main veto power, and there is another veto power caused by the two-thirds majority rule, that is, if seven or eight countries unite, they can prevent the conference from amending the draft treaty. This is absolutely unacceptable.

[Reuters] Paris, 4th: The Paris Conference is about to enter its second week, and the issue of "majority voting" is still an obstacle to substantive discussion. Invitations for 21 countries to invite five former enemy countries to attend and state their opinions may also be issued next week. Representatives from the five countries are already in Paris, but the chief representatives are still waiting for formal invitations in their home countries. Albania, Egypt, Luxembourg, Mexico, Cuba, and other countries have also requested to participate in the peace conference. It is not yet known whether they will be able to get their wish. Most of the peace conference representatives believe that it would be good to allow Albania and other five countries to attend and state their opinions, but they should not be formal member states of the peace conference. Some believe that the Soviet Union should also attend to state its opinions on the Austrian-Italian border. The disputes that may arise regarding the content of the treaty include the issue of Trieste and the Italian colonies. Representatives of Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus have already hinted at this in the conference. Regarding the distribution of the Italian fleet, the naval experts of the four major powers still have no final agreement. They have classified the Italian ships into three levels, A, B, and C, but how to distribute them to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union cannot yet be resolved. The Soviet Union suggested using a lottery method, which was opposed by the United Kingdom. It is expected that this matter will be sent back to the Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion.

### Small Country Representatives Criticized One After Another; Bernath Defended; Listed Points of Disagreement in Draft Treaty, Said All Countries Have Opportunity to Make Recommendations

[Associated Press] Paris, 4th: Some representatives have criticized the Paris Peace Conference as a formalistic meeting. US Secretary of State Bernath made a brief defense on this point at a press conference tonight and listed 26 issues in the draft treaty that the four major powers have not agreed on, which need to be decided by the peace conference.

[Reuters] Paris, 4th: Authoritative sources say: Bernath said that the 17 small countries will have the opportunity to make recommendations on the 32 issues that the four foreign ministers have not resolved, including (1) the determination of the Italian-Yugoslav border and the Trieste issue, (2) the status of the Trieste regime, (3) Italian reparations to countries other than the Soviet Union, (4) the issue of free navigation on the Danube, (5) the border issue in the Bulgarian treaty.

[French News Agency] Paris, 4th: US Secretary of State Bernath told reporters from our agency that the peace conference has made progress in the first week, which has exceeded our expectations, especially the Regulations Committee has achieved significant results. Representatives of various countries have publicly expressed their opinions. The main goal of this peace conference is to allow representatives of various countries to express their opinions as much as possible. Therefore, I believe that the four major powers should give priority to the other 17 countries in expressing their opinions on the draft treaty, because they did not participate in the drafting of the treaty. Only in this way can it be considered equal. I want to make the Luxembourg Palace an open forum where all participating countries can express their opinions. I do not want the world to say that this peace conference is another conference of the four major powers, but a conference of the 21 countries, or even a conference of the 17 countries. I am also happy to say that the United States will fully support all the recommendations passed by the conference with a two-thirds majority to ensure their implementation. I requested that the chairmen of the five committees drafting the treaty be filled by representatives from countries other than the four major powers, which is also the reason. In short, we should always provide convenience to small and medium-sized countries, no matter what. Some people think that it is a mistake to replace the plenary meeting with a small group committee to discuss the treaty. The final recommendations adopted by the conference must be approved by the plenary meeting.

### Internationalization of Trieste; Drafting of Management Regulations

Experts from Four Countries Dream Different Dreams

[United Press] Paris, 4th: After the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union decided to make Trieste an international port, they sent experts to organize a committee to draft the port's management regulations. According to reliable sources, experts from the four countries are sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams and will submit different reports to the peace conference. Soviet experts support Yugoslavia's request to be in charge of management matters. Experts from France, Britain, and the United States advocate that since Trieste has been designated as an international port, the chairman of the port government should be borne by a country that is politically neutral. At the same time, people in Trieste are now speculating whether the port will actually live up to its name and become a center for merchants and travelers, or degenerate into a "ghost area." Most of the Allied soldiers and civilians also believe that it is either one or the other, and the key lies in whether it is handled properly.

### Cuba Requests to Participate in the Peace Conference

[Associated Press] Paris, 4th: It was learned here today that Cuba has formally requested the four major powers to allow it to participate in the 21-nation peace conference. Cuban Minister Ayala submitted a note signed by Cuban Foreign Minister Alvarez to the representatives of the four major powers, stating that Cuba had declared war on the Axis powers and had signed the United Nations Declaration, so it should be allowed to participate in the meeting. Cuba is the second Latin American country to request participation in the peace conference. Mexico made the request before the peace conference convened, but no decision has been made yet.

### United Nations General Assembly to Convene Next Month; Preparations Underway; Provisional Agenda Sent to Member States

[Reuters, New York, 4th] The United Nations General Assembly will be held in Lake Success starting September 23rd, with the session potentially lasting six to seven weeks. During this time, the various committees will hold between 300 and 400 meetings. A special committee, chaired by UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie's assistant, Cordier, is currently preparing the work plan for the General Assembly. It holds meetings six days a week, including evening sessions, and will make recommendations on the meeting content for the General Assembly and its various committees. All of this will be publicly broadcast by newspapers and radio. In the first week, the heads of delegations from various countries will deliver speeches to the General Assembly, after which the six main committees will separately discuss the agenda drafted by the General Committee. Finally, each committee will submit reports and resolutions to the General Assembly for discussion in plenary session.

[United States Information Service, New York, 4th] The United Nations Headquarters has just released the provisional agenda for the General Assembly, which has now been sent to the 51 member states. The key points of the provisional agenda include consideration of Security Council recommendations, the admission of new member states, discussion of Australia's proposal to reconsider the voting method of the Security Council, consideration of India's proposal to discuss the treatment of people of Indian origin in South Africa. According to the provisional agenda, after the opening ceremony of the General Assembly, the report of the Nominations Committee will follow, electing the staff of the General Assembly and discussing the provisional agenda. The Secretary-General will then report on the rules of procedure and proposed changes, followed by the Secretary-General's report on the working situation of the United Nations organization, which will then be followed by the report of the Security Council. After the General Assembly discusses the issue of admitting new member states, it will then elect three non-permanent members of the Security Council and six members of the Economic and Social Council. This will be followed by discussions on trust territory agreements, the permanent location of the United Nations Headquarters, administrative and budgetary issues, and the obligations of member states. Following that will be the report of the United Nations, outlining the global grain shortage, the economic reconstruction of war-torn areas, and the resettlement of refugees. The General Assembly will then consider various agreements with designated agencies and discuss the transfer of former League of Nations institutions to the United Nations. Finally, the General Assembly will discuss treaty registration, as well as the Indian and Australian proposals, and the proposed 1946-47 United Nations budget. At the same time, United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has prepared a detailed report to be submitted to the General Assembly, outlining the progress of the United Nations, stating that although the progress of the United Nations may not be entirely satisfactory, there is no reason for disappointment. He said that the United Nations is based on a major assumption, namely that the permanent members of the Security Council will reach agreement on major issues. Lie also said, "The veto" illustrates the obligation of the permanent members to reach agreement on their own.

### Former "Millard's Review" Editorial Writer Powell Testifies; Far East Tribunal Discovers Secret Japanese Documents Proving the Foreign Ministry Knew About the Conspiracy to Invade China

[Gaizosha, Tokyo, 5th] The Far East International Tribunal heard testimony today from Powell, the last witness to the Northeast Incident and former editorial writer for the "Millard's Review" and the "Chicago Tribune," describing the situation at the time of the September 18th Incident. He stated that in 1931, in order to report on the situation of the Northeast Incident, he and a group of American journalists arrived in Shenyang on September 23rd, at which time the city was completely occupied by the Japanese army, and Doihara had been appointed "Acting Mayor of Shenyang." When meeting with Doihara, piles of railway wreckage were visible in front of the Japanese army headquarters, which was quite shocking. Doihara explained that this railway wreckage was from the bombing of the Liutiao Lake section of the South Manchuria Railway and showed photographs of the area, showing that the area had been cleaned up, the damaged location had been replaced with new rails, and two sleepers had also been replaced. Upon closer inspection, there was no evidence to be found. Fifty to one hundred meters away from the bombed railway track, there were three bodies of Chinese soldiers, who were said to have been attempting to escape after bombing the railway, but there were no bloodstains on the bodies. While in Shenyang, he had purchased many photographs of groups of Japanese people wearing ordinary clothes, with armbands, holding guns. The armbands read "Zaikōgunjin," meaning reservists. According to US consular officials and foreigners, several days before the incident, many people were wearing these armbands. The deputy manager of the Far East of Standard Oil indicated to me a Japanese military camp and what appeared to be a warehouse, saying that the building contained heavy artillery and heavy artillery shells, which were brought in under the guise of mining machinery. At the time, when reporters sent telegrams, they had to present their press passes. Initially, there were no obstructions, but later there were some restrictions, and they were monitored by military police. Although he had not personally witnessed the atrocities of the Japanese in the Northeast, there were frequent reports, one of which was published in "Millard's Review," in which the Japanese, on the pretext that the village was hiding Russian guerrillas, killed as many as 3,000 people in a certain village in the Northeast. Because the area was blockaded by the Japanese army, it was impossible to go there to investigate, but according to Chinese and foreign missionaries, this was indeed the case. Powell then went on to describe General Ma Zhanshan, saying that he had met Ma twice. After the battle of Jiangqiao, Ma burned bridges to prevent the Japanese army from advancing, retreating towards Qiqihar, and then retreating along the Hinggan Mountains towards Aigun. As a result of negotiations with Doihara, General Ma Zhanshan had taken up the post of Minister of the Army of the puppet Manchukuo, but upon returning to Shanghai, he sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, saying that he had accepted the post of Minister of the Army of the puppet Manchukuo and had accepted five million yuan in gold bars from the Japanese army, but that he had delayed negotiations with Doihara and had entered Soviet territory from Aigun, moving westward, and had rejoined the National Army. He is still a loyal Chinese and is currently in Baotou, etc.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] The International Tribunal discovered secret Japanese documents, revealing that the Japanese Foreign Ministry had prior knowledge of the invasion plan, while claiming ignorance to the outside world. This document proves that Japan had deliberately seized foreign capital to operate businesses in China, in order to supply Japan's war machine. The Japanese Navy, which often publicly condemned the Army's hostile actions in China, also proved to have actively participated in the invasion as early as 1936. The Japanese Cabinet's southward advance policy also proved to have started in 1936, not 1940.

### Unprecedented Earthquake in Central America

[News Agency, New York, 4th] The seismological observatories of Fordham University in New York State and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena detected yesterday afternoon at 5:57 PM Greenwich Standard Time (11:51 PM Shanghai time) "the most severe earthquake in history, the magnitude of which caused the recording paper to run out." Experts believe that the epicenter of the earthquake was in the Caribbean Sea, near the coast of Venezuela. If it had been closer to densely populated areas, the loss of life and other damage would have been enormous. The earthquake had not completely stopped until 12:30 AM this morning. A California scientist said that this earthquake "was not as severe as the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906."

### International Christian Conference Opens Yesterday in Cambridge, England; Sixty Delegates from Various Countries Attend

[Associated Press, Cambridge, England, 4th] The International Christian Conference opened today, lasting for four days. Dulles, an advisor to the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, served as chairman and delivered a speech stating that although the world's moral and spiritual strength is insufficient, a just and lasting peace can still be achieved. He also asked the sixty attending delegates to discuss the extremely tense situation between the Soviet Union and Western countries, saying that even if no conclusion is reached, it is not a problem. This urgent situation did not begin today and should not be daunting. The situation between major powers is often very tense, but it has always been hidden, and now it is being fully vented. Although Dulles advocated that the meeting should be open to the public, there would still be several closed meetings.

[Associated Press, London, 4th] Eight Christian churches issued a declaration today, advocating unified action with the Catholic Church on world issues, to establish a certain degree of satisfactory understanding at the highest level, which roughly refers to the World Council of Churches and the Roman Curia. This proposal was announced by the Secretary-General of the United Christian Council, Kirk. All churches support this plan.

### Visiting the TVA in Knoxville, Visiting the Former Residence of the Great Writer Mark Twain (Part 2)

— Our Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

I regret that I did not encounter such an experience on my way to Tennessee. Like everyone else, the white people's train was quiet and orderly. As the train entered Kentucky, it gradually entered the mountainous area. Because there were many upward slopes, the train speed was very slow. From Kentucky to Tennessee, my impression of this route was no different from the mountainous areas of southwestern China. The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina are just like our Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang; however, they are in the southeast, and we are in the southwest. The Kentucky-Tennessee section of the Southern Railway Company is like our Guizhou-Guangxi Railway and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and also like the Beichuan Railway near Beipei. The train climbed up the hillside, winding through the mountain valleys, like a porter carrying a heavy load. Presumably, when it was built in the past, it was built to accommodate the mountains, with fewer tunnels, so it was not built like the Swiss mountain railway, mostly made up of tunnels and bridges. From Kentucky to Tennessee, I saw three large mountain tunnels and two small mountain tunnels. The large mountain tunnels only took two minutes to pass through. Every time the train passed through a mountain tunnel, the windows were covered with a gas like water droplets. I don't know if this gas is the so-called "miasma" of the southwestern mountains of China? The further south I went, the hotter the climate became. I changed trains twice in "Oak Ridge," a small town in central Tennessee, and turned east. Two hours later, I arrived in Knoxville, the central hub of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).

Knoxville is a typical small American town. Before the TVA, the population was only about 10,000. Now, Knoxville's population has exceeded 150,000. Many retired army and navy officers and soldiers asked for peacetime jobs, and the government introduced them to the TVA. Most of the enterprises in the United States are privately owned, and state-owned enterprises are very, very few. The TVA is a pioneering initiative of a large state-owned enterprise in the United States, and therefore, it has become the best place for the wartime government to settle veterans. Next door to the TVA's general office is the veteran registration office. Tennessee is surrounded by mountains, and Knoxville is a small plain between the mountains, like Tongliang and Hechuan in Sichuan. The capital of Tennessee is Nashville, and the state university of Tennessee is in Knoxville. The state university is famous for its agriculture. One of the three directors of the TVA, Harcourt Morgan, is the former president of the University of Tennessee and a well-known agricultural expert in the United States. Few Chinese students study in the southern United States. Mr. Dunford of the registration office of the University of Tennessee told me that a long time ago, there were Chinese students studying at the university. Now there is one female student and one male student named Zhang studying at the University of Tennessee. Mr. Zhang works at the TVA, specializing in learning about the TVA's water conservancy projects. Overseas Chinese are all over the United States, and Knoxville is no exception. Lao George, from Kaiping, Guangdong, owns a large laundry here and employs many Americans.

There are about ten overseas Chinese in the entire city of Knoxville. One of them has even opened a bookstore specializing in Western books. But, in any case, the Americans here are still unfamiliar with China. As I walked on the four or five main streets of Knoxville, I was often stared at by many unfamiliar eyes. The southern United States is relatively conservative, and their knowledge of overseas is not as "well-informed" as that of the north. Also, Southerners speak with a strong accent. It's still English, but it's harder to understand. The day after I arrived in Knoxville, I met Ms. Foster, a female reporter from the "Knoxville News Sentinel." She asked me, "Do you find the Southern accent hard to understand when you come to Tennessee?" I said yes. She said, "Even Americans from Chicago and New York often make many jokes because of language misunderstandings, let alone you are not American!" The newspaper was interested in China's plan to build the Yangtze River water conservancy project. The Knoxville "News Sentinel" published news and interviews about my arrival in Knoxville and also published my photo. Mr. Berthe, a judge of the Supreme Court of Belgium, who arrived the day before me, was also sent to inspect the TVA. The newspaper wanted to take a photo of him, but he said, "According to Belgian law, judges' photos are not allowed to be published." The next day, the newspaper used his words as the title of the news. There are two major newspapers in Knoxville, the "News Sentinel" is one of them, and the other is the "Knoxville Journal." The "News Sentinel" is one of the important local newspapers of the Howard Group. Originally, the "News" and the "Sentinel" were separate newspapers. The "Sentinel" was founded as early as 1886 and has been published for sixty years. The history of the "News" is relatively short. In 1941, the two newspapers officially merged. Currently, there are 175 employees in the entire newspaper, and about 30 in the editorial and interviewing department. I met their editor-in-chief, Mr. Miller, and photographer Mr. Anderson. The other newspaper is the "Knoxville Journal," with the headline on the cover: "The largest newspaper in the Tennessee Valley." It is known for its many photos. There is a full page of editorials every day. On the editorial page, there are different "wise sayings and ancient precepts" every day, many of which are excerpts from the Bible. Because my time was very short, I have not yet visited the Journal. In the southern United States, the weather is so hot in summer that it is suffocating. I live in a "Park Hotel" near the TVA's headquarters.

Mr. Schaeffer, who is in charge of receiving me at the TVA News Department, first asked me, "Is there a fan in the hotel room?" The TVA has new guests from various countries coming to visit almost every day. Therefore, the organizational structure of its "News Department" (or Consultation Department, Publicity Department, etc.) is large. Whenever a visitor or inspector comes, they prepare various materials and arrange the itinerary and program of the visit. They are experienced and methodical in doing this work. I stayed at the TVA for ten days. From the first day I met Mr. Henley, the deputy director of the News Department, my time was arranged as tightly as a middle school student attending class. When to go to the dam? When to watch a movie? (Movies about the TVA), and even when to go to the library to see reference books, were all arranged very tightly. The ten days were not an "enjoyable" inspection, but simply "training"! But no matter what, this kind of training life is lovely. Mr. Berthe, a Belgian judge, was the only classmate who "received training" with me. He often joked with the TVA staff, "It's enough to see, the TVA is so powerful!"

### Twenty-Six Military Traitors Executed by Firing Squad; Wan Lilang and Others; Betrayed Mid-Way, Served in Puppet Posts, and Committed All Kinds of Evil; Female Prisoner Chen Lu Swayed Before Execution

(Report from this newspaper) Wan Lilang, the director of the puppet political security bureau, Chu Yapeng, the deputy director of the puppet investigation and statistics department, and Huang Xi, the director of the military affairs department of the puppet military and political department, and twenty-three other military traitors who served the enemy and puppets during the enemy-puppet period, were escorted from the Shanghai Temporary Prison to the Songhu Garrison Command yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM to verify their identities before being tied to the Song Park execution ground and executed by firing squad.

Wan Lilang and others were originally underground workers of our military organs, but later they were lured by profit and betrayed us midway, selling themselves to the enemy. After serving in puppet posts, they repeatedly sabotaged our great cause of resisting Japan, harmed our workers, and even oppressed the people, committing all kinds of evil deeds. Their crimes are too numerous to mention. After the victory, they were successively captured by the relevant authorities and sentenced to death. The sentences were presented to Chairman Chiang for approval before execution.

Misunderstanding and False Alarm

Yesterday, when the prisoners were escorted to the garrison headquarters, they did not yet know that their last day had come and were calm, and some even carried replacement clothes and held folding fans. When they were being tied up, a reporter from a certain newspaper approached to get a closer look, and the soldiers mistakenly thought he was one of the prisoners. Ropes were put around his neck, but he shouted that he was a news reporter and was released. The plaza of the garrison headquarters was heavily guarded. When the prisoners were being identified and driven onto the prison truck, Chen Lu, one of the female prisoners, swayed and was dragged onto the truck by soldiers. Two trucks carrying the execution soldiers drove to the execution ground. The garrison headquarters also sent Section Chief Xu of the Military Law Department and Deputy Director Xu Zhongfen of the Shanghai Temporary Prison to the scene to supervise the execution. The list of all executed personnel is as follows: (1) First, the pseudo-positions provided and held by the colleagues are as follows:

### Heatwave Hits Shanghai: Three Expected in August

[Reported by this newspaper] The weather is getting hotter and hotter. Yesterday, there was no wind at all. Even the tables and chairs indoors felt like they had just been baked by the stove, not to mention the parched and withered pedestrians on the street.

The temperature the day before yesterday was 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, while yesterday it was 99.7 degrees. Father Long Xiangqi of the Xujiahui Observatory said: This heatwave is still normal. There will be a total of three heatwaves in August. The first is around August 4th, the second is on the 12th, and the third is on the 28th. Father Long has been engaged in meteorological research in Shanghai for decades. He said that in some years, July is the hottest month, but in other years, August is the hottest, as is the case this year. However, one thing is noteworthy: when it is hot in July, the days are hot, and the nights are also very hot. But after August 15th, although the days are hot, the nights become much cooler.

### The Garrison Command Cracks Down on a Counterfeit Money Manufacturing Organization: Confiscates Billions of Yuan in Counterfeit Money: Ten People Arrested in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Other Three Locations: Gunfight at Nanxiang: Printing Plates Engraved by Famous Masters

At the end of last month, Feng Zhongda, section chief of the Garrison Command's Inspection Office, and deputy section chief Sheng Changfu, accidentally discovered a type of 2,000-yuan banknote of the Central Bank's 1945 edition. They immediately began an investigation and determined that the organization had branches in Suzhou, Nanxiang, and Shanghai. Sheng led a team to Suzhou on the morning of July 28th. After three days of investigation, they learned the location of the counterfeit money manufacturing organization. On the 30th, he returned to Shanghai to report and discuss the results. On August 3rd, Section Chief Feng and Deputy Section Chief Sheng personally led more than ten officers. Feng was responsible for the arrest work in Suzhou, while Sheng was responsible for the work in Nanxiang. Other officers were sent to Shanghai to wait for news from Suzhou and Nanxiang. Feng went to Suzhou on the 3rd. After deploying troops, they took action and arrested six principal offenders in Suzhou within half an hour. At the same time, two principal offenders were also arrested in Nanxiang on the same day. After Feng completed the work in Suzhou, he urgently telegraphed the personnel in Shanghai, instructing them to search for the secrets of the counterfeit money organization in the city, and immediately led personnel to Shanghai. As a result, the Shanghai branch was also cracked down, and two principal offenders were arrested. The ten principal offenders arrested in the three locations were escorted to the Garrison Command for legal action. However, several accomplices in Nanxiang are still at large and are being actively pursued. According to Section Chief Feng, counterfeiting money disrupts finance and is extremely harmful. He said he was pleased to report the case was solved within 36 short hours. As a result of the efforts of the department's personnel, more than 1.1 million yuan of counterfeit money was seized in the three locations, along with a large number of printing plates and machinery. After being printed, the counterfeit money had already been used in the Beijing-Shanghai area, Changzhou, and Nanxiang, totaling more than 3.1 million yuan. The unprinted counterfeit money was as high as five feet, totaling hundreds of millions of yuan. If the case had not been cracked yesterday, this money would have been printed and mixed into the market. The engraving work for the counterfeit money printing plates was done by the hand of a first-class national engraving master (whose name is expected to be released today). Before the war, the gift certificates of various banks in the city and the printing plates of the puppet Central Reserve Bank notes during the occupation were all done by this person. Therefore, the printing of this counterfeit money, only the number of the banknote and the seal of the president are slightly blurred (not done by this person), and the rest of the printing is almost indistinguishable, making it extremely difficult to identify. The printing of the counterfeit money is divided into four plates, which have now all been seized. The internal organization of the counterfeit money organization is divided into (1) printing, (2) selling, and (3) using. As for the more than 30 million yuan of counterfeit money already used in the Beijing-Shanghai area, it was decided to find a way to recover it. In addition to printing counterfeit 2,000-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank's 1945 edition, the counterfeit money organization was also testing the color separation of 50-yuan Customs Gold Unit notes. This was also cracked down. Therefore, if the counterfeit money organization had not been cracked down one month later, the impact on the national financial community would have been self-evident.

Details of the Case Cracking

[Another Report] The Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command cracked down on a large-scale counterfeit money printing organization of the Central Bank in Nanxiang on the 4th of this month. The full truth of the case is explored below: In recent months, counterfeit 2,000-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank have been discovered in the Beijing-Shanghai area, appearing repeatedly and difficult to distinguish from the real thing. The Garrison Command dispatched a large number of personnel to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places for investigation, starting last month. After receiving a tip-off last month, Director Tao, under the instruction of Commander Xuan, ordered section chief Feng Zhongda (former commander of the Reconnaissance and Prevention Brigade) to assign personnel to work in Suzhou. Section Chief Feng ordered Deputy Section Chief Sheng Changfu to lead section chief Lu Zhengzhang, deputy section chief Li Zui, Zhou Jiaqi, Zhuang Yongji, and others to gather and go to Suzhou at 6:00 AM on July 29th. After opening room 321 at the Lexiang Hotel, they immediately planned the investigation and deployment strategy in the morning.

Based on the information provided by the original informant, it was known that the case was closely related to Zhang Jianliang, who lived at 117 Jingde Road, Suzhou. The original informant secretly identified Zhang and Yu Delong, who came with Zhang, by their facial features at the Red Star Tea House. Personnel were then dispatched to follow them, and they were seen going to Zheng Wenhuan's house at 48 Bifengfang. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, Zhang was seen with another man surnamed Qin at room 306 of the Lexiang Hotel. Zhou Jiaqi was sent to open another room, 304, to secretly monitor their actions. That night, they searched the room in conjunction with the local police局 and learned that the man surnamed Qin was named Rongchang, 36 years old, from Wuxi, and worked as a butcher in the meat market on Caishi Street in Shanghai (his room was guaranteed by Zhu Axiang, the owner of the Fulu Shou Caifan Restaurant in Suzhou). Since Qin and Zhang had dealings with each other, they were clearly one of the people involved in this case. That evening, the investigators took a bath at the Qingquan Bathhouse and learned from the tea room that Qin Rongchang, Zhu Axiang, and Zhang Jianliang were very close. At this point in the investigation, action steps were taken. On the morning of August 3rd, Section Chief Feng from Shanghai personally led chief members Si Baochun and Ling, and others to Suzhou to make arrangements. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, Zhang Jianliang was arrested at the Red Star Tea House. According to his confession, his accomplices were Zhu Axiang, Zheng Bohuan (also known as Wenhuan), Che Lanru, Han Boxun, Yu Delong, and others, who were jointly using and selling counterfeit money. They then separately arrested the offenders. Under further interrogation, it was learned that Qin Rongchang, who had come with Zhang Jianliang, was indeed one of the main offenders in this case. It was discovered that Qin had returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Lu Zhengzhang returned to Shanghai first thing on the morning of the 4th and arrested Qin at 57 Diandang Lane, Fangxie Road, Nanshi.

According to Qin's confession, Bao Mouzhu was an important figure in this case and often sipped tea at the Datong Tea House. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, Vice-Section Chief Shi Weipu and others were dispatched to the Datong Tea House and arrested Bao. Bao confessed that the counterfeit money printing organization was located at Zhaijiazhai, No. 3 Bridge, Nanxiang. At 7:00 PM that evening, a large number of personnel were ordered to be led by Bao to the destination. Unexpectedly, the people in the counterfeit money printing organization dared to open fire to resist arrest, and a gunfight broke out between the two sides. As a result, Zhang Jinsheng and Huang Rongquan were arrested, and a wooden pistol, 18 bullets, and printing orders were seized. The two offenders and the seized items were escorted back to Shanghai at 9:00 PM. At 11:00 PM that afternoon, Qin and others went to the house of key offender Bao Jiasheng at 30 Yongshun Lane, Huaji Road, Hongkou, and seized on the spot one large and one small printing press, one pack of transparent paper, one pack of pigment, three copper plates, two triangular feet, and one pack of wax, which were all taken to the office.

The offenders arrested in the three locations in this case are as follows: Those arrested in Suzhou are: Zhu Axiang, from Wuxi (selling counterfeit money); Zhang Jianliang, from Suzhou (promoting counterfeit money); Zheng Bohuan, from Wuxi (manufacturing counterfeit money); Che Lanru, from Shanghai (receiving and using counterfeit money); Yu Delong, from Yixing (using counterfeit money); Han Boxun (Korean) (suspect). Those arrested in Shanghai are: Qin Rongchang, from Wuxi (the initiator of the counterfeit money printing in Suzhou); Bao Jiasheng, from Ningbo (in charge of raising counterfeit money copper plates). Those arrested in Nanxiang are: Zhang Jinsheng, from Wuxi (printing worker); Huang Rongquan, from Zhenhai (printing worker).

[Reported by this newspaper from Suzhou on the 5th] Recently, many counterfeit banknotes have been discovered in the market, all of which are 2,000-yuan lotus green, and the imitation is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The Songhu Garrison Command received a tip-off that there was a counterfeit money promotion organization in Suzhou and sent Colonel Feng Zhongda of the Inspection Office and many officers to Suzhou on the 3rd. Based on the clues, they successively arrested Che Lanru, chief physician of Jianhua Hospital, Han Qiao Han Boxun, Zhang Jianmin, Yu Depang, Chen Wenhuan, Zhu Axiang, and other six people. 940,000 yuan of brand-new counterfeit banknotes were seized from the offenders. All the witnesses were escorted to Shanghai on the 4th for interrogation.

### Dance Star Guan Minli Participates in the Election

[Reported by this newspaper]

The elections for "Miss Shanghai" and various groups of "Stars" and "Queens" are rapidly unfolding with enthusiastic support from all walks of life. At the same time, the responsible authorities of the Shanghai Fundraising Association of the Subei Refugee Relief Association made a solemn statement, stating that the motivation for this activity is entirely to provide relief to the disaster victims and is by no means a frivolous pastime. The fundraising target is 200,000,000 yuan. If all walks of life can uphold the spirit of human mutual assistance and the ancient precepts of disaster relief and neighborly love and enthusiastically participate and contribute to the cause, then this number can certainly be exceeded. Considering the severity of the disaster in Hunan and Henan, which is no less than that in Subei, the association has decided to allocate all the amount exceeding the target to Hunan, Henan, and other places.

According to the reporter, red dance star Miss Guan Minli (pictured) has already registered to participate in the dance girl group election. Miss Guan is 25 years old, from Wuxi, and is 5 feet 1 inch tall. Before the War of Resistance, she was a red star in dance halls such as Datong, Xianle, and Paramount. After the war, she went to Hong Kong, then to Guilin. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, she secretly came to Shanghai and joined the Metropolitan Dance Hall as a dance girl. Her residence also served as a liaison office for underground workers. Later, it was discovered by the enemy and puppets, and she left Shanghai again for Hong Kong, only returning to Shanghai last month. It is said that Miss Guan is scheduled to join the New Xianlin Dance Hall on the 8th.

Regarding the incident of the Metropolitan Dance Hall manager embezzling the donation of dance girl Li Zhenzhen (previously mistakenly reported to be serving in MGM), the Shanghai Fundraising Association of the Subei Refugee Relief Association sent someone to inquire about the truth from Mr. Rong, who purchased dance tickets for the original donation on that day. According to him, he only raised 300,000 yuan with a few friends on the night of the charity dance, and he did not purchase 1,000,000 yuan worth of tickets. Mr. Rong also wrote a statement in his own hand and handed it over to the association as evidence, and Li Zhenzhen has also denied the matter.

### Two Ships of the French Postal Company Bring in a Large Amount of Vietnamese Rice

[Reported by this newspaper] The French Postal Shipping Company has resumed shipping between China and Vietnam. The first cargo ship, Yingguangan, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month, carrying 25,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. The details have already been reported in previous newspapers. It is learned that the cargo on the ship has now been unloaded and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Vietnam today. The second ship, Auguste Bavier, also arrived at port at 3:00 PM on the 4th. In addition to carrying foreign rice, the ship had eleven passengers, including two Westerners and nine Chinese. The ship will return to Vietnam in mid-month. The Venipico Spake, managed by the foreign department of Jardine Matheson, brought coal from Pearl Harbor to China this time. It was originally scheduled to unload in Qingdao, but the hull was slightly damaged when passing through the Wusongkou, so it entered the port for repairs. The work has now been completed and is scheduled to leave for Qingdao today. The Si Fan Er Deng, managed by Shunheng Foreign Firm, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around the 9th, bringing a large amount of railway materials from the United States.

### Railway Bureau Security Has Been Actively Strengthened

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Two-Way Railway Administration, whom the reporter recently interviewed, the derailment of the Beijing-Shanghai passenger train in Zhoujing Lane on the 10th of last month was caused by the track spikes being pried off. Following this, two hand grenades were found in the postal compartment of the 9th passenger train at Nanjing Station on the 17th of last month. Based on the above two facts, it is clear that the rioters have planned to sabotage the trains on the two routes. The Railway Bureau has now actively strengthened the security of the railway.

### Minister Chen Attends Symposium of Principals of Municipal Middle Schools and Delivers Instructions

[Report from Our Newspaper] Principals of public and private middle schools in Shanghai held a symposium yesterday at the auditorium of Aurora University. Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, at the invitation of the Municipal Education Bureau, attended and delivered instructions yesterday morning at 10:00 AM.

After an introductory speech by Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Municipal Education Bureau, Minister Chen rose to speak amidst warm applause. First, he briefly reviewed the work of the Ministry of Education in the past and then expressed his views on education, stating: Education should be coordinated with politics and should be centered on the Three Principles of the People, so that every citizen has the opportunity to receive education. Chinese education has always been centered on morality, with wisdom, benevolence, and courage combined to form morality. Chen also said: These three are the universal virtues, and the way to practice them is one. What is one? Sincerity. Sincerity is faith, wisdom, universal love, and strength. Where sincerity leads, even metal and stone will open. The task of education is to promote human compassion. Today's education, which cannot cultivate the virtue of loving others and cannot create ambitious youth, needs to be reformed. Chen also said: The first purpose of education is "control," the second purpose is "nurturing," and the third purpose is "safeguarding." Whether the future of the country is promising depends on whether the students of the future work hard, are disciplined, and have faith and strength. Education is omnipotent, depending on our aspirations. We should train students according to the inherent virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, so that future education will have a more great and brighter future. Chen's spirits were particularly good yesterday, and despite his high fever, he spoke fluently for as long as two hours. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

### Small Stories from National Central University

— Yi Shui

The school resumed operations, and National Central University received priority. Starting on April 15th, the students boarded ships one after another and returned to Nanjing in batches. So far, six batches have arrived, totaling about 2,000 people, living in the Sipailou campus. The Sipailou, which had been quiet for a while, is gradually becoming lively.

The National Central University students who have returned to Nanjing are mostly engaged in work to pass the long summer vacation and earn some money. Some are helping the school, and some are working as civil servants in government agencies, earning tens of thousands of yuan a month, which is a small supplement to living expenses.

The National Central University Student Union, in order to provide students with spiritual food, has opened a reading room in a large room next to the Student Union office, with newspapers from all over the world readily available. Whenever they are free after meals, everyone goes to read the newspapers, and they are all delighted.

The YMCA has launched a student work self-help program, and many National Central University students have participated. Some are conducting social surveys, and some are helping with typing. They work 72 hours a month, earning 400 yuan per hour, for a total of 28,800 yuan per month.

When the students were in Shapingba, they used to sit in teahouses when they had nothing to do. Nanjing does not have such facilities, so when they have nothing to do, they can only lie in bed and sleep or read novels.

Mr. Luo Zongluo, the president of National Taiwan University and the director of the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Academia Sinica, described it in detail in the month, especially praising the equipment of the agricultural and medical colleges.

Before the war, National Central University had very few teachers and students, but now it has increased three or four times. The original classrooms and dormitories are not enough. In order to solve this difficulty, the school authorities have contracted with merchants to build seven dormitories. The bidding has been completed, and construction is underway. It is estimated that the project will be completed in 100 clear days. It is rumored that the construction costs a total of 2 billion yuan, but the official has not released the exact amount.

After the dormitories are built, National Central University [unclear character] will start school, which is estimated to be around the beginning of December. (Sent July 27th)

### Recent News from Academia Sinica: Over a Hundred Researchers Already Working in Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, Director Wang Zhongji (Jiaji) of Academia Sinica told reporters that the institute's facilities had been largely destroyed by fire during the war. However, the seven institutes of mathematics, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, psychology, and medicine are now operating at the original site of the Japanese Natural Science Research Institute in front of Maple Bridge. The buildings there are spacious, the environment is beautiful, and all the arrangements are quite magnificent, truly a good place for scholars to conduct research with a clear mind. Currently, over a hundred researchers have returned to their positions and are busy sorting and categorizing the large instruments that have been taken over. Formal research work has not yet begun. In addition, there are over a hundred researchers in the capital at the five institutes of astronomy, meteorology, geology, history, linguistics, and sociology. In the future, most of the institutes in Shanghai will be concentrated in the capital. The Maple Bridge site will only house a medical research institute. The institute's research work will be carried out in cooperation with various university graduate schools. However, detailed plans will be decided upon after the completion of the restoration and the holding of a council meeting. The institute's current monthly operating expenses are only 90 million yuan, which is a severe financial strain. The institute regularly publishes journals from the institutes of zoology, psychology, meteorology, geology, history, linguistics, and sociology. The research papers of other institutes are also often published in foreign academic journals. Hua Luogeng, the famous mathematician who recently returned from the Soviet Union, is also a researcher at the institute.

### Zhejiang's Education Funds Extremely Difficult

Shaoxing Opera Stage Donation to Subsidize, Jiaxing Raising Small Chickens for Sale

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou] The difficulty of funding education in Zhejiang Province can be said to have reached an extreme. Those in charge truly feel like "a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." Recently, local authorities have been finding ways to remedy the situation themselves. Otherwise, under the slogan of "education first," the results will be far inferior to what they were before. It is reported that in Shaoxing, since the victory, theatrical performances in villages and towns to thank the gods have been very popular. The council believes that using the county's opera stage donation, which is a part of the local entertainment donation, to subsidize the education funds of local elementary schools is very appropriate. The plan has now been decided and will be submitted to the county for approval before it can be implemented. At the same time, Min Hanzhang, a councilor from Yunshang Township in Jiaxing, in response to the call for raising education funds, came up with a more unconventional method: initiating the raising of small chickens by distributing them to households for temporary care. After they grow up, all of them will be sold, and the proceeds will be used entirely for the education fund. It is reported that more than 1,000 chickens have already been raised, and it is estimated that they will be fully grown in the winter, yielding a price of over 8 million yuan.

### Overseas Chinese Qunsheng Basketball Team Returns Home from Expedition, Encountering Danger on the Xiamen Sea, Steamer "Endeavour" Hits Reef Near Dongshan, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends Rescue Ships, Danger Averted

The overseas Chinese Qunsheng Basketball Team from the Philippines returned home from their expedition, passing through Xiamen to Shanghai. The news has already been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, Cai Dawen, the team's representative in Shanghai, stated: "The Qunsheng team boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's 'Endeavour' steamer on the 25th to sail to Xiamen. On the evening of the 28th, they arrived near Dongshan, at the Mangshan sea. It was expected that they would reach their destination on the 29th. Unexpectedly, at 2 a.m. the next morning, the 'Endeavour' unfortunately hit a reef. The bow of the ship was breached by three square feet, and seawater rushed in. All the passengers on board were panicked, especially the women and children, who were crying. The order was disrupted. Fortunately, the entire Qunsheng team helped maintain order and were responsible for transporting the women and children ashore. After attempting to find a way to rescue the team with the help of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the danger was averted," etc. Qian Xucang, chairman of the Shanghai Sports Association Basketball Committee, considering that the team encountered danger on their way home from their expedition but fortunately were safe, will send a telegram to the team in Xiamen today to express his condolences.

### Tonight's Group A Volleyball Match: Soviet Union vs. Huayan

The women's match between Nanxing and Huayan is really a battle related to ranking. Among the women's teams, besides the three outstanding teams of Youdui, Wuben, and Youlian, the fourth place should be contested by the remaining teams. In terms of experience, Huayan may win. If Nanxing can produce a surprise victory, it may not be able to overwhelm Huayan. Today, the two women's teams will fight fiercely to compete for ranking, and it is worth watching.

The final match is the men's Group A match between the Soviet Union and Huayan, which is considered to be one of the highlights of this year's competition. Huayan has just defeated Yuegang a few days ago and is eyeing the championship. In a friendly match, Huayan had defeated the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union attaches great importance to the volleyball championship. Yuegang has already been defeated by Huayan, so this battle is somewhat of a final. This battle is a wonderful battle in this year's Group A, and there is no doubt about it. The schedule is as follows:

Red Team—World (B2) 5:30 PM

### Qu Yaokang Fetes Li Huitang, Thiel Doux Flies to Hong Kong

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Huitang, the "King of Football," who led the South China Football Team to Shanghai to hold charity football matches, has been in Shanghai for nearly twenty days since his arrival. Besides a two-day trip to Beijing, he has been practicing tennis on Zhaozhujiao Road every day in Shanghai. Last night, Qu Yaokang, a person enthusiastic about sports, hosted a special banquet for Li Huitang at Huibinlou. Among those invited to accompany him were the former famous football coach, the Westerner Li Silian, Chen Hanming, Ke Lasha, and tennis players Li Guofan, Wang Lido, and others, eight or nine people in total. During the banquet, the host and guests talked freely about major events in the sports world. At around 9:00 PM, after taking a group photo, they dispersed.

[Another Report] The famous Italian goalkeeper Thiel Doux has recently decided to go to Hong Kong to join the Oriental Association. If a plane ticket can be arranged today, he may fly to Hong Kong with Feng Jingxiang this afternoon. Therefore, at Qu's banquet last night, he repeatedly asked Li Huitang to take care of Thiel Doux after returning to Hong Kong, because he had never been to South China and was unfamiliar with the people and place. It is natural to need someone familiar to take care of him. As for when Li Huitang himself will leave Shanghai, various parties are very concerned. Last night, the reporter asked if he would stay in Shanghai for a while. According to him, "Besides entrusting someone to buy a plane ticket, I will probably stay in Shanghai for another two or three days. There are some personal matters that have not been completed and need to be dealt with urgently. As soon as they are completed, I will immediately move to return to the south."

The City Government previously stipulated employee guarantee rules and guarantee rules for personnel managing property. As some parts were not applicable, they have been merged and revised into employee guarantee rules, effective from August 1st.

New employees will be handled in accordance with the revised rules.

### Eighth District People's Representative Assembly Requests Filling in Zhaojiabang

People's representatives of the Eighth District (Xujiahui) believe that the section of Zhaojiabang within the district, from the Xujiahui Tianzhu Bridge to Tushanwan, has poor drainage of sewage and is detrimental to sanitation. Two options, dredging and filling, have been proposed and submitted to the municipal authorities for approval.

### 21st District Promotes Mass Literacy Movement

On the 2nd of this month, the Culture Section of the 21st District Office (Jiangwan) convened a forum with various bao chiefs and principals of public and private elementary schools at the district office to discuss ways to promote mass literacy education. The district office instructed the bao offices to widely publicize and urge the jia chiefs to persuade households to enroll. When necessary, the bao and jia offices may use a lottery method to order enrollment.

### Questions and Answers on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)

(26) Question: Residents of villages and towns often report several families as one household to reduce taxes, and one family as several households to avoid conscription. Furthermore, there are places where civil servants and military dependents gather. If the number of bao and jia is increased according to the organization, the selection of bao and jia chiefs will also be a problem. How should this be resolved?

Answer: Refer to Articles 45 and 53 of the Outline of the Organization of Counties at All Levels and the County Baojia Household Registration Compilation Method to strictly compile the baojia household registration to meet the statutory number. Public temples, boat households, and specially compiled temporary households are attached to ordinary households and are not subject to number restrictions. As for the selection of bao and jia chiefs, the principle is to select fair gentry from the local area as much as possible.

(27) Question: Are "going elsewhere" and "moving out" the same thing, or is there a distinction?

Answer: "Going elsewhere" and "moving out" should be two different things. "Going elsewhere" refers to being temporarily absent from the survey location at the time of the survey. "Moving out" refers to leaving the survey location for a long period of time. "Going elsewhere" is still part of the permanent population within the original household registration, while "moving out" is part of the permanent population within the current household. Therefore, although "moving out" is "going elsewhere," "going elsewhere" is not necessarily "moving out." Furthermore, according to Article 3 of the Temporary Household Registration Regulations, "moving out" should be changed to "moving away."

(28) Question: What type of household registration should cooperatives be classified under?

Answer: Cooperative public welfare associations, unlike ordinary shops for profit, should be classified as public households in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 4 of the County Baojia Household Registration Compilation Method, which refers to other public places.

(29) Question: How should the surname of someone who inherits two family lines be registered?

Answer: Article 985 of the Civil Code stipulates that a person with a spouse may not remarry, and Article 237 of the Criminal Code further stipulates that a person who remarries shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years. Therefore, the matter of inheriting two lines, if it occurred before the implementation of the Family Law of the Civil Code, should not violate Articles 4 and 5 of the Household Registration Law, which state that "no one may have two household registrations or dependent registrations at the same time," and Article 1 of the Regulations on Restrictions on the Use of Names, which states that "the name of a citizen of the Republic of China is limited to one and is registered on the household registration book as the real name." One place may be designated as the household registration or dependent registration, and one real name may be used. Two household registrations or dependent registrations cannot be held at the same time, and two real names cannot be used. The circumstances of combining two family lines should be noted in the remarks column of the application form for investigation. If it occurred after the implementation of the Family Law of the Civil Code, it is legally invalid and will not result in two names or two household registrations or dependent registrations in the household registration.

### District Briefs

Ni Canhui, the deputy district chief of the 22nd District (Jiangwan), has submitted a resignation which has been approved. Xu Zhongtian, the chief secretary of the district, has been appointed by the Municipal Government to fill the vacant deputy district chief position.

Su Huimin and Zhang Rengui, district people's representatives of the 54th bao of the 4th district, held a jia chief discussion meeting at the bao office at 3 PM on the 4th.

The 13th District Office (Putuo) implemented free vaccination against smallpox. After consulting with the 5th District Health Center, nine districts were divided, and vaccination for residents of various bao was implemented from July 25th, which was completed yesterday.

The 2nd District Office is recruiting one clerk. Anyone who can write official documents well, has a secondary education, is of good character, and has no bad habits, regardless of gender, may apply at the 2nd District Office, located on the first floor of the Laozha Police Substation at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Tianjin Road, on the 6th and 7th of this month.

The bao cadres of the 7th District Office (Changre) held their 8th work review meeting at the office at 3 PM on July 31st. Furthermore, the position of cadre of the District People's Representative Assembly in the same district is held concurrently by the Chief Secretary of the District Office, Qian. It is reported that the first District People's Representative Assembly will be held on the 10th and 11th of this month at No. 200 Talastor Road.

### American Merchants Prepare to Receive Incoming Raw Material Orders, Resulting in Difficulties for Foreign Firms and Brokers

[Report from our newspaper] The market for dye raw materials for dye factories has been extremely weak recently. The number of tea deals has decreased significantly compared to before. New brands of American sulfide dyes, NK and HK, have arrived. Their quality is slightly lower than 693 and 692, and the price is also lower. Currently, HK sells for around 900,000, and NK sells for around 1,100,000, but there are few inquiries. Indigo has also arrived, but has not yet been sold. Because this type of dye has not yet been launched on the market, manufacturers dare not purchase new brands of dye. Sulfide alkali has arrived in the greatest quantities, and the price has already fallen to around 35,000. Traders are unwilling to lower the price further due to cost considerations, while manufacturers are mostly aware of the large number of orders arriving and are still waiting for prices to drop further. According to experienced raw material traders, many of those who place orders with foreign countries are unplanned. There are many households, and they value secrecy. When the goods arrive at the port, those with limited capital are eager to sell, so the price drops to the bottom. According to their estimates, the current market prices for sulfide alkali and insurance powder are already close to cost. If the price drops further, it will result in losses. No one is willing to do it unless they can withstand the pressure of heavy profits. They also say that some foreign firms are indeed honest in handling orders, but there are also unscrupulous traders who take advantage of the situation. When goods are scarce and prices are high, the goods delivered to designated customers are not the entire amount. Furthermore, when orders are placed, the customers pay a certain percentage of the price to the foreign firm, but the foreign firm has a separate contract with the foreign merchant and does not need to pay the full amount.

Profits from Hedging are Considerable

Therefore, the excess down payment can be invested for profit. When goods arrive from abroad, the procedure involves a letter of credit system. The foreign firm must unload the goods at the dock before preparing funds to collect the warehouse receipt. The designated customer must pay the foreign firm the full amount of the goods upon receiving notification. The firm is informed when the cargo ship is about to arrive at the port. Currently, there is insufficient space at the docks, and customs procedures are cumbersome. It often takes a month from the time the ship arrives at the port to the time it is unloaded. The interest earned during this period is also considerable. Furthermore, the docks are currently unstable, warehouses are scarce, and miscellaneous fees are endless. Large customers may be able to handle it themselves, but small customers and ordinary factories often entrust foreign firms to handle it on their behalf. The complexity of the calculations and the incompleteness of the documents create opportunities for foreign firms to make money. It is said that a certain foreign firm has earned three to four hundred thousand US dollars this year due to these various factors. Under this heavy layer of exploitation, it has become extremely difficult for designated customers to make money. Currently, people in the industry are afraid and hope for change. According to various sources, few new orders are being placed recently. However, those with access to information point out that the goods arriving in the future will be directly sold by American merchants, and the quantity may increase. Upon investigation, the largest American pigment company in the Far East is the恒信 Foreign Firm, while soda ash has historically been sold in bulk by the British卜內門 Foreign Firm. There was news that恒信 would resume operations long ago, but it has not yet materialized. People in the industry have repeatedly spread rumors that a certain Zhou, who was formerly a comprador for the德孚 Foreign Firm, will take the position of comprador for 恒信. When asked to people close to the firm, they said there was no confirmed news. The 南星 Foreign Firm is also a large-scale American pigment firm. People in the industry also spread rumors that its former comprador, Wang, is also seeking opportunities.

Merchants Headache Due to Evasion and Exploitation

According to those close to customs, there has been a lot of smuggling recently. At the docks and warehouses, some people have pointed out that the original goods are missing weight. Therefore, those in charge are quite anxious and have requested the assistance of the municipal chamber of commerce. However, the chamber of commerce has politely declined due to insufficient manpower. Currently, everyone in the market has a headache regarding the warehouse receipts for goods leaving the浦東 warehouses. The reason is due to this. According to those familiar with the situation, there is currently insufficient space at the浦西 docks, and those occupied by government agencies are not helpful for commercial use. Therefore,浦東 warehouses are making triple the profits. When people holding receipts go to pick up goods, if they find that the weight is missing, neither the seller of the receipt nor the warehouse is responsible. Furthermore, the cost of the barges exceeds the cost of shipping across the Pacific Ocean from the United States. Taking the aforementioned sulfide alkali as an example, it is currently sold for 35,000 yuan, while the barge fee alone costs several thousand yuan, not including dock tips.

### Public Bond Trading is Scarce

Publicly priced transactions are even rarer. Speculative buying is more active. Unconsolidated丙 bonds are not as lively as detached bonds. Unconsolidated丙 bonds continue to struggle between 680 yuan and 700 yuan, lacking momentum for change. As a result, they fell 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. 甲 and 乙 bonds are relatively stable. 丁 bonds rose slightly by 10 yuan, while 戊 bonds fell back by 50 yuan.

### 謙泰豫 Bank Opens, Receives Over 3 Billion in Deposits

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai branch of 謙泰豫 Bank moved into its new location at 561 Hankou Road last month and opened yesterday. On that day, it received deposits totaling over 3 billion yuan. The bank's head office was established in Chongqing more than 20 years ago. It currently has branches in Chongqing, Jiangjin, Baisha, Luxian, and other places. Branches are currently being planned in Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places.

### Striving for Market, Exchanging Goods, Significance of Textile Exports, Overseas Chinese Have Strong Need for Domestic Goods

[Report from our newspaper] According to a person in charge of the China Textile Construction Company, the company's recent proposal to the government to lift the ban on textile exports is mainly aimed at seizing the opportunity to lay the foundation for the sale of Chinese textiles in the Southeast Asian market. It is said that the significance of this matter can be divided into three aspects: (1) From the international perspective, a large number of American cottons have recently been shipped to Japan one after another. The Japanese textile industry has already started 3.5 million to 4 million spindles. It is currently actively promoting trade to Southeast Asia. The United Kingdom is also actively reorganizing textile mills in India in order to mass produce and expand the Southeast Asian market. Therefore, from the perspective of international market competition, it is imperative to strive for the Southeast Asian market at this time. (2) In general terms, the domestic market's need for textiles must be taken into account. However, the domestic market's need is mostly for coarse yarn. If a portion of fine yarn above 32 counts and fine cloth below 12 pounds can be reasonably distributed to foreign markets, it will not affect domestic market prices and will stimulate production. At the same time, the sale of textiles to Southeast Asia will consider barter exchange methods in order to easily obtain urgently needed food sugar, rubber, rice, coal, gasoline, ramie, wood, and other materials. This will undoubtedly help the entire Chinese economy. (3) In specific terms, leaders of overseas Chinese in Java and Siam recently intend to purchase various fine yarns and colored fabrics from the Textile Construction Authority, totaling 120,000 pounds, and hope to ship them out by mid-month. Therefore, it is hoped that the ban on textile exports can be lifted before the deadline so that exports can be made on schedule. From the perspective of Textile Construction, this can be said to be a win-win situation. (甲) The enemy-owned textile mills taken over by Textile Construction are mostly equipped with machines mainly for spinning fine yarn, so this can be fully utilized. (乙) Textile Construction's future business should focus on developing the foreign market as its primary objective. It is now heard that government authorities believe that lifting the ban on textile exports is deeply and significantly related to China's international trade, and may consider discussing it with the Supreme National Defense Council for the record.

### Allotted Sugar Sold on the Black Market, Authorities are Planning to Improve Measures, Sugar Firms May also be Allotted

The平價 sugar in this city has been distributed by the Taiwan Sugar Company in the seventh phase. The retail stores throughout the city began selling on the second of this month. The eighth phase is currently being verified, and the ninth phase will be registered this Wednesday. A total of 11,456 packages were distributed in the seventh phase, priced at 740 yuan per catty, and the retail price was set at 860 yuan. However, because the black market price is twice as high as the allotted price, and the price in other cities is even higher, merchants transfer the allotted sugar to the black market in various ways, so citizens still cannot purchase it. It is heard that the allotment method will be changed, and the Taiwan Sugar Company and the Social Affairs Bureau are discussing it. According to Taiwan Sugar Company General Manager Shen Zhennan, the purpose of changing the 平價 sugar allotment to retail merchants this time was to suppress sugar prices and facilitate the citizens of the city. The company agrees to try it from a supply perspective. Now that the phenomenon of being unable to buy it has occurred, the benefits have fallen into the hands of a few people, which is truly contrary to the original intention of the authorities. According to the Sugar Industry Association, it is hoped that the Social Affairs Bureau will improve the measures and still directly allot to sugar merchants. The authorities have taken this into consideration.

### Mountain Villagers Have No Profit to be Made, Source of Bamboo is Scarce

[Report from our newspaper] Xixi塢 in the west of Xiao邑 is famous for its production of bamboo and wood. The general residents mostly rely on the abundance of bamboo and wood in the mountains for their livelihoods. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the bamboo trade plummeted, and the people's economy was extremely depleted. After eight years of war, although all the毛竹 have been accumulated for a long time, the export of毛竹 this year has been even more reduced than before. Because the cost is too high, each head of bamboo is estimated to weigh slightly less than 900 catties, plus cutting, dragging, bunching, and transportation costs, plus a tax of 270 yuan per head, for a total cost of more than 14,000 yuan per head (not including round-trip travel expenses). With insufficient capital, they can only sell it to traders in the nearby Meixi鎭. According to the current market price of bamboo, each head is only sold for 15,000 to 16,000 yuan, with no profit to be made. Furthermore, the traders' payment for goods often requires a term of one or two months. The mountain villagers bear too much interest and are all taking a passive attitude.

### Coincidentally, Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Hit, 章 is affected by傅, Chinese Stocks and French Merchants Support Enemies, Foreign Stocks are Desolate

Chinese stocks had no support. Although they wanted to revive midway, they were still weak at the closing. Major accounts were indifferent and sought supply 蛟 to balance. Rongfeng Yarn Factory owner Zhang was summoned as a suspected traitor, and there was no lack of sympathy for the fall of a rabbit. The mid-way fell from high to盘跌.

The medium and small stocks, which were relatively cold, continued to fall slightly. The veteran stocks continued to be oversupplied and fell a little further. Xinguangrong has caught up with Jingfu and is on par with it. The foreign stock market was deserted and lifeless. French merchant J.C. Dupuy had 3,000 shares of Yisha. Because he had supported the enemy, he was wanted by the authorities after the victory. However, he has not yet been captured, and all of the French traitor's stocks have been sold and transferred to the market. Recently, some people holding stocks have registered with the company authorities and discovered that the stocks belong to the French traitor and are in the column of enemy property, which has caused problems. Holders have sought to sell them, but buyers are hesitant. Some believe that until the exact number of stocks is investigated and cleared, the foreign stock market's transactions may be suspended. Yisha opened in the morning at 8,500 yuan, with selling but no buying. When it retreated to the 8,000 yuan mark, only a few hundred shares were traded. The rest had no transaction.

### Northeast Peace Negotiations

— This newspaper's August 1st airmail dispatch. Northeast Special Correspondent Han Qingtao

In August, on the Northeast Great Plains, sorghum grows taller than people, enough to conceal people and livestock. This is when the "green screen" that everyone often hears about rises.

When the Green Screen Rises

The green screen presents a significant threat to the summer life of the people of Northeast China, because the continuous large fields of sorghum are precisely the areas where bandits hide and emerge. Travelers in the countryside inquire of each other whether the road is "clear."

Today, the situation is different. What lies before us is a problem that is even more harmful than the banditry of the past: "war." The green screen is conducive to one side conducting sabotage or providing the best tactical advantage, so everyone seems to have a heavy weight pressing on their hearts.

The situation, the news, is constantly spinning in a circle of worry and joy, or joy and worry, never finding a boundary or a normal place. How can emotions calm down?

Coming "To Learn"

On July 11th and 14th, Lin Biao did not go to Changchun to attend the "Du-Lin Meeting" as invited, which caused great frustration. On the 21st, Li Lisan flew to Changchun on behalf of Lin Biao to visit important political figures. Then on the 25th, he flew to Shenyang, seemingly bringing some hope.

On the 26th, Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Command, received Li Lisan for the first time at the Command Headquarters, accompanied by Cai Zonglian, Director of the Changchun Forward Branch of the Military Mediation Department. The conversation lasted three hours. After the meeting, Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang answered reporters' questions, saying, "Commander Du and Mr. Li drank tea, smoked cigarettes, and talked about everything under the sun." Leaving reporters baffled.

On the 27th, Li Lisan paid his respects to Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters. What they talked about is unknown. What is known is that Li Lisan could not discuss the Northeast issue with Director Xiong as the subject, nor did he put forward a practical plan for the overall peace of the Northeast. Li Lisan repeatedly stated that this trip was "to learn."

In Commander Du's Private Residence

At noon on the 28th, Commander Du received Li Lisan for the second time. In order to know the truth of this matter, the reporter, under the scorching sun, rushed to Chongde Street in the southwest corner of Shenyang City and entered a conspicuous small green-tiled building. The owner of this house was originally a Korean prince, and now it is General Du Yuming, who commands the Northeast National Army. The two or three small reception rooms inside have hosted important figures traveling between Beijing and Shenyang, Northeast gentry, and celebrities from all walks of life, solving countless problems concerning the Northeast.

It was a Sunday. Two jeeps were parked at the entrance. Outside the reception room door was another jeep, flying the American flag, with a beautiful female driver sitting on top, leisurely watching the curling smoke. A patch of rocks and small trees were silent, everything displaying an atmosphere of tranquility.

Inside, in the large reception room on the right, sat three figures arguing over positions and perceptions. One was Commander Du Yuming, another was Dong Chenglie, the government representative of the Military Mediation, and the third was Lin Biao's representative, Li Lisan.

When the clock in the reception room struck ten, the three figures began to talk, discussing two issues. The first was to abide by the January 10th agreement, with the government accepting sovereignty over the Northeast and avoiding conflict. The second was to restore transportation and repair the large railway bridge across the First Songhua River, which had been destroyed by the Communist forces.

Li Lisan said, "At this time, repairing the Songhua River railway bridge is a step towards military strategic offensive preparedness, and there is no other explanation." Commander Du said, "Repairing the bridge is for peace, for the national economy and people's livelihood, and for the opening of the China Changchun Railway. After the bridge is repaired, troops will never be transported across it. At the same time, I can say that if the National Army attacks, they can cross the river from anywhere, without relying solely on the railway bridge."

Regarding the first point, Li Lisan said, "Receiving the Northeast does not necessarily require the government to dispatch batches of receiving personnel. This can avoid conflict." Commander Du said, "It is in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance to maintain the authority of the government. As long as the Communist forces do not disturb the National Army, the National Army will never overstep the boundaries."

During the conversation, the voices of both sides rose and fell. Li Lisan constantly emitted the laughter that Chinese people make when discussing matters, and also kept saying, "A joke, a joke, that's really a joke!" The Hunan accent constantly had a "striving for the upper hand," "overwhelming the other party" attitude.

Clang, the clock struck one. The opinions of Du and Li still maintained a distant gap. Although Dong Chenglie sometimes interjected a word or two in the middle, or supplemented some opinions, in the end, nothing of substance was gained. Finally, the conversation was declared over.

The Songhua River "Peace Bridge"

On the evening of the 28th, Commander Du, in order to fulfill his duty as host, hosted a banquet for Li Lisan on the third floor of the Command Headquarters, and invited Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang, Director Cai Zonglian, the Communist members of the three-person team, and the American representative, Colonel Norman, etc., totaling more than twenty people. It can be said that the atmosphere was "lively and cheerful" and "harmonious and friendly."

After three rounds of wine and five courses of dishes, everyone talked about the bridge repair issue again. Li Lisan said, "I received a telegram from Commander Lin saying that the Songhua River railway bridge has already been mostly repaired by your side. My intention is that during the negotiation period, it is best not to repair it temporarily." Commander Du repeatedly guaranteed that repairing the bridge had no military significance, and solemnly declared, "If the Communist side has sincerity and faith, Chinese peace can definitely be achieved from the Northeast negotiations." Li Lisan again expressed disagreement with Commander Du's opinion. Commander Du then said with a smile, "We can use a public opinion poll!" Which aroused a burst of laughter from those present!

American Colonel Norman spoke, and the English translation was a suggestion to establish a neutral zone on the bridge. Commander Du said, "The bridge is in the hands of the National Army, so there should be no problem with the repair. After the repair, I guarantee that the National Army will never attack. Otherwise, the executive group can send personnel to be stationed on the bridge." Colonel Norman smiled and agreed. Commander Du asked, "Would you be willing to go?" Colonel Norman replied with a smile, "I am willing to go!"

Openness, frankness, and straightforwardness filled the entire scene. Li was also greatly moved and had the words to accept Commander Du's bridge repair method. However, the next day, Li expressed to the Central News Agency reporters that he had not said, "Finally, Li accepted Commander Du's bridge repair method." He said he said this: "Since that is the case, I am willing to do my best to avoid the expansion of the incident, telegraph Commander Lin for a decision, and submit it to the Changchun Executive Branch for resolution." On the eve of Li Lisan's departure from Shenyang—at half past four in the afternoon of the 29th, Provisional Headquarters representative Gong Qiaomin, Changchun Forward Branch Director of the Military Mediation Cai Zonglian, and Li Lisan tentatively discussed the issue of both sides releasing prisoners of war. The Provisional Headquarters advocated the complete release of both sides. Li said that Lin Biao had not authorized him, so he could not make a full negotiation. As a result, it was limited to the exchange of opinions between the two sides.

Regarding the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in the Communist-controlled areas, it is generally expected to proceed gradually, because this matter had already been agreed upon by Lin Biao through the mediation of the Executive Group before Li Lisan left Harbin. But how to proceed technically? When can it possibly begin? It must be after Li Lisan returns to Harbin and reports what was discussed in Shenyang to Lin Biao before the Communist side can formally provide an answer.

The power supply in Shenyang is far too poor. The issue of transmitting electricity from Xiaofengman to Shenyang was agreed upon by Lin Biao at the same time as the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in the Communist-controlled areas. Now, after the coordination of Mayor Dong Wenqi and Li Lisan, a solution has been reached technically, that is, the dispatched engineering personnel must all wear armbands with the words "Line Repair Engineering Team" separately printed by the municipal government and the three-person team. In addition, they must also have identity certificates and accompany the liaison personnel sent by the Communist side to carry out the repair of the damaged lines between Meihekou and Nanzamu. They departed from Shenyang on August 1st. Some people say, "This is beneficial to the Communist side, because the Xiaofengman power source is in the hands of the National Army, and only one section of the line passes through the Communist area. They can also obtain electricity through this."

On the morning of the 30th, Li Lisan flew to Changchun, followed by a flight to Harbin to report back. He spent five full days in Shenyang, merely exchanging views on the principles of various issues with military and political authorities. Because the distance in opinions was still far, no concrete results were obtained. Was Li Lisan's trip worthwhile? Was it entirely to "learn"? What did both sides gain? This is for everyone to experience for themselves!

A memorial service was held on the 25th. Provincial Chairman Liu personally attended the ceremony. The emotional Chairman Liu even cried bitterly and was almost unable to [illegible]. All the people present at the sacrifice were also deeply moved, and the entire hall cried. Chairman Liu personally asked Provincial Party Committee Chairman Chen and Provincial Security Deputy Commander Liu Yizhou, Police Chief Qi [illegible], etc., to [illegible] methods for arresting the murderer, and instructed all responsible personnel to strictly investigate and ensure capture, without allowing them to escape, and immediately [illegible] Deputy Commander Liu to take charge of the matter. There were also telegrams from the central government, ordering the arrest of [illegible] the murderer.

Deputy Commander Liu, who is in charge of handling this case, is a very suitable person. During the 30-year sports event, the Luoyang [illegible] kidnapping and assassination case, [illegible] sitting alone in a quiet room, thinking deeply [illegible] often for three to five hours, and he would eventually be able to see through the mechanisms. Therefore, solving the Zhang case is only a matter of time. However, the general public hopes that it can be solved quickly to [illegible] people's hearts and restore the locality!

The press in Kaifeng was particularly shocked, unanimously believing this was a despicable and shameful act. However, we always hope that on the one hand, the case will be solved quickly, and on the other hand, there should be measures to mend the fold after the sheep has been lost. The security deployment is really too lacking in meticulousness!

### The Mystery of Zhang Yanmao's Assassination

— Kaifeng 27th Dispatch. Liu Ji

The Kunming Li and Wen case has not yet been settled, and the assassination case of Zhang Yanmao, Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Department, suddenly occurred in Kaifeng, Such lawlessness is truly shocking the entire country. The authorities should immediately seek effective prevention methods so that similar incidents do not happen again. Otherwise, society will become increasingly shaken and uneasy.

The Zhang case is quite unexpected by the general public, because Zhang is sincere, modest, calm, and taciturn. He has always served in the central government, so he is unlikely to offend anyone. Nor have we heard that he has any grievances with the local people. On the morning of the 23rd, the reporter was chatting with thirty-two friends in the room when suddenly a friend walked in and said, "Secretary-General Zhang has been assassinated!" As soon as the words were uttered, everyone was shocked! Based on what was said above about Zhang's life, this is truly too bizarre!

It is said that on the morning of the 23rd, Zhang, as usual, took his own eight-horsepower rickshaw to the Provincial Party Department to work. While passing through the corner of Yanshou Temple Street, two people riding bicycles, wearing newly made grass-green uniforms and pistols in holsters, suddenly chased after Zhang, repeatedly shouting to stop. The rickshaw puller mistakenly thought they were friends, so he stopped. Zhang also got out of the car, with one foot on the ground and one foot still in the carriage. One of the two people immediately took out a gun and fired a shot at Zhang's head, which missed. The other person then fired several shots in succession, hitting three shots. Zhang died on the spot. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two people rode away on their bicycles!

Although Yanshou Temple Street is located in a remote area, it is still within the city. Moreover, a police post is set up at the street corner where the incident occurred. Yet, in broad daylight, the murderers were allowed to escape freely. It is unknown what the police post is responsible for. It is said that the police officer did not know what happened at the time, and only learned about it afterwards. He then quickly returned to his station to report. By the time the news was sent out and people rushed to the scene of the incident, Zhang's family and friends were weeping bitterly over the body. The security officials were also unable to devise any methods for arresting the perpetrators. The provincial leaders also came to visit one after another, but everyone had no good ideas. The main reason is that this matter is too bizarre and it is simply impossible to find any clues!

After the Zhang case occurred, people were panicking, and the gate control of various agencies became more stringent as a result. According to general discussion on the causes of this case, there are two types, (1) political and (2) vendetta. But what exactly is going on? No conclusion has been reached to this day, because everyone infers that Zhang is unlikely to have any enemies. As for political reasons, that is hard to say. However, from the situation of the murderer, we can know that there was a detailed plan and preparation beforehand, and there are planners and instigators behind the scenes. This can be determined.

### Typhoon Musings

— Zheng Zizheng

The term typhoon originally came from the Cantonese word for strong wind. This type of strong wind is a tropical anti-clockwise cyclone. Its formation is due to the collision of the northeast trade winds and the southwest monsoon, which creates a vortex of airflow. Therefore, typhoons often form at the interface between equatorial air masses and subtropical air masses. In the typhoon formation zone, solar radiation is strong, convection is very strong, and both temperature and humidity are high. The tropical storm formed by this air mass allows the typhoon center to store a high degree of potential energy. Based on the experience of the past thirty-four years, the typhoon formation area generally occurs west of Guam and north of Yap Island, but with slight seasonal variations. In early summer, the latitude of its occurrence is slightly more southern. In midsummer, the latitude of its occurrence turns more northern. The movement of typhoons is first eastward and then westward, and after reaching the turning point, it changes to the northeast. Although its path has no rules, it generally forms a parabolic line. Typhoons that strike the Chinese coast mostly occur in July. In the past thirty years, there have been sixty-five times. In August there are only forty-eight times. September has twenty times, and June only ten times. Before June and after September, the typhoon's strength [illegible] and the Chinese coast [illegible]. The paths typhoons [illegible] often take to strike China can be roughly divided into two. 1. From the east of the Philippine Islands, advance northwestward across northern Luzon Island to the South China Sea, turning to strike southern China. In early summer and autumn, its path often follows this route. 2. From the northeast of Luzon Island, move northwestward or north-northwestward through the southern Ryukyu Islands, crossing Taiwan or skimming over Taipei and attacking the southeastern coast of China. Checking the number of typhoons landing on the Chinese coast, 70 percent landed between Zhenhai and Hong Kong. More specifically, typhoons landing south of 25 degrees north latitude account for 68 percent, and those landing north of 25 degrees north latitude account for only 32 percent. After a typhoon lands, the wind force is greatly reduced, but there are also cases where it [illegible] continues to support its power and enters the Yellow Sea to reach Korea, or crosses the Yangtze River and peeks into North China, but the number is quite small. The extent of a typhoon's northward power, in terms of its number, is that more than 60 percent do not exceed 40 degrees north latitude. The average speed of a typhoon's movement is fifteen miles per hour, but its maximum speed can reach forty miles per hour. In the East China Sea, the typhoon's movement is relatively slow, at thirteen or fourteen miles per hour. In the Yellow Sea, the movement is faster, at about eighteen or nineteen miles. When the typhoon's direction of movement is about to change, its movement is particularly slow. After turning, the speed of movement often increases by half as much as before turning. From formation to disappearance, typhoons seen in the Far East in recent years can last up to twenty-six days, but most average only six or seven days. The typhoon's wind force only feels tight and rainy when approaching the center of the wind by one hundred miles. When a typhoon comes, there are strong winds and heavy rains. [Illegible] One year, on July 11, a typhoon passed over northern Luzon, and rainfall reached 46 inches in 24 hours, breaking the world record for torrential rain. On July 19, 1926, a typhoon struck Hong Kong, with rainfall reaching 21 inches in one day. There were as many as nine rain disasters caused by typhoons in the southeastern coast area from the beginning of the Republic to 1932. Among the disasters caused by this type of typhoon, the wind disaster in Shantou on August 2, 1922, was the most tragic. This time, the death toll reached more than 60,000 people. Losses are estimated to have exceeded 70 million yuan in that year. According to past records, only sixteen typhoons have landed between Shanghai and Zhenhai successively. The threat of typhoons received near Shanghai is much less than in Wenzhou and points south. Currently, in addition to weather reports provided on time by ships stationed in the ocean and island meteorological stations, whenever a new typhoon is discovered, meteorological reconnaissance aircraft are dispatched at any time to determine its location. Currently, only Guam and Manila have this type of flight reconnaissance atmospheric equipment. If China develops its shipping and establishes its navy, this type of equipment to assist in weather reconnaissance is essential. Although there are no accurate statistics on the annual typhoon losses suffered by people along the Chinese coast, it is estimated to be considerable. As for the hardships felt by boatmen and fishermen in general, whose livelihoods are dependent on the sea, they are even more profound. Shanghai is an international commercial port, and ships coming and going from various countries need meteorological reports. The [illegible] government authorities should pay attention to and assist in promoting the progress of meteorological construction. This will not only be convenient for commercial navigation. Fishermen and boatmen will also benefit greatly.

### Switzerland: An International Summer Capital

Lushan has become China's summer capital today, with its secluded forests, flowing springs around the houses. Living in the mountains, one truly does not know that there is still a hot summer in the world. But the world's summer capital is Switzerland. Not only does it have a mild climate and four seasons like spring, but some mountain tops are covered with snow all year round. Even in the noon of July and August when the sun is overhead, it will still make people feel slightly cold. Before the war, every summer, thousands upon thousands of travelers came to this small country by air and land to escape the heat. This has always been a considerable income for the Swiss government. During the war years, everyone was fighting hand-to-hand on the line of life and death, and Switzerland was naturally much deserted. Now, with the victory of the war, the scenic mountains and waters of Switzerland will restore their former glory.

Switzerland is mostly mountainous, with the Alps running across the entire country, accounting for almost three-fifths of its entire territory. The first time you arrive in Switzerland [illegible] a place is like a rockery scene, [illegible] ups and downs, creating a spectacular sight. Some peaks soar into the clouds, looking down on the lower world; others undulate continuously, like waves on the sea, chasing each other; among these high and low peaks, there are [illegible] countless towns and villages of all sizes.

The scenery of Switzerland is also like the situation in the southern and northern sections of the Alps, full of many distinct landscapes. Even one village is different from another, and one town is different from another. Some places seem to be entirely Arctic landscapes, barren and without vegetation, but after walking for only a few hours, you will discover another world, a southern-style plateau with olive trees, pine trees, and corn growing in a lush, pleasing green. One place is cold [illegible], while another is warm like spring. Switzerland is truly an enchanting place! Its air seems to always have a clear freshness.

Interestingly, this is also the case in terms of architecture. In Switzerland, you can see quaint old-fashioned wooden houses, wooden sun decks, and brightly colored walls everywhere, but at the same time, you can also see towering French-style marble buildings standing side by side on the road.

Speaking of this, we must of course especially mention the federal capital of Switzerland, Geneva, and its world-famous Lake Geneva, which almost every tourist visits. Lake Geneva is surrounded by mountains on all sides, with beautiful scenery, which goes without saying. By the lake (actually, it should be said in the lake), there is also a very historic prison called "Chillon Castle." It is built in the lake, surrounded by water on all sides. Some [illegible] rooms [illegible] are even built underwater, forming a crystal palace of bronze walls and iron walls. The shimmering [illegible] water beats [illegible] outside, and all day long there is only a thin line of light, which penetrates in from the small window of the iron railing. Outside is a world of beautiful mountains and clear waters, while inside is a tragic and bleak life that is forever isolated from all of this. How can this scene not make people sad! A patriot who worked hard for Switzerland's independence was once arrested and imprisoned in this "Chillon Castle" for twenty-five years. Byron, a famous poet of the 19th century in England, traveled here and wrote a short poem that was famous throughout Europe, praising this castle. Since then, this prison, which stands in the lake and has long been eroded by wind and rain, has become a symbol of freedom and independence for oppressed people around the world. (Jun Mo)

### Two Inappropriate Aspects of the Study Abroad Examination

Editor: I am one of the participants in the Ministry of Education's publicly funded study abroad examination this time. I deeply admire the meticulous planning and serious, strict invigilation of the Shanghai Education Bureau beforehand, as well as the orderly examination process without any irregularities, as your newspaper described as "a phenomenon unique to those handling examinations in various places." However, the Ministry of Education seems to lack deliberation in the formulation of regulations and test questions, thus losing the principle of fairness. Therefore, I raise two points for your newspaper to consider for discussion among all parties: (1) The countries to which students are being sent this time are divided into eleven countries, including England, America, Canada, Australia, France, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, and Sweden. Among them, apart from England, America, Canada, and Australia, the other countries have their own common languages and writing systems. However, the Ministry of Education stipulates this time that anyone who is not proficient in the language of the country they are applying to can use English instead. If the students are not familiar with the language of the country they are going to, how can they listen to lectures, read, and even pursue further studies after going abroad? (2) The test questions for specialized subjects this time are all in English, which leads to the phenomenon that some people who are not proficient in English, and have no intention of going to England or America, cannot understand the meaning of the questions. Moreover, each country has its own unique characteristics, and there are unique perspectives in these areas. Even specialized terms and the symbols used are not entirely the same. Students usually browse books in the language they are familiar with, but now they are all changed to English, how can they express their true talents and learning, and obtain fair competition? I only hope that the authorities will improve this. (Examinee)

### Proposal to Organize a Universal Education Guidance Class

Editor:

No one would deny that psychological construction is an effective remedy for saving morality from decline. The implementation of this construction relies on "universal education." The educational undertakings in this city have always been known as developed, but compared with the population and the number of schools, they are still not proportional. Therefore, I suggest to those enthusiastic about education: establish a "Universal Education Guidance Class." As for the method, it is proposed to use educational talents among public and education personnel. Those who are willing to be tutors for the "Universal Education Class" (or semi-voluntary tutors); any industrial and commercial organizations that can automatically recruit apprentices and workers, with more than 20 people, can apply to the nearest "Universal Education Class" in accordance with the regulations. After passing the review, a tutor will be assigned to teach (the applicant will pay a small amount of travel expenses each month, or it will be completely voluntary). The class time is more suitable after work. In the past, when I was the principal of the Yongping Yixiao Day and Night School in Caojiadu, I once established a "Universal Education Class." At that time, a small number of factories and merchants came to apply, and public officials were also recruited to serve as tutors. The trial run was somewhat successful. This time, if initiated by advanced figures in the education field, and with the sponsorship of the education authorities, assigning personnel for guidance, organizing in districts, so that young people who dropped out of school midway can have the opportunity to study after work, it will surely have a significant effect for the country and society. (Reader Chen Jiping)

### Repetition of Lane and Alley Names

Reporter: I live on Gongping Road in Tilanqiao. There are two Gongping Li and one Gongping Fang on this road. One Gongping Li and Gongping Fang are adjacent to each other, and the other Gongping Li is separated by two roads, which is not too far away. There are also two number 35 addresses in Gongping Fang, without any A or B distinctions. The postmen delivering letters and the guests visiting friends are confused every day. Who should be asked to correct this? I think the police station and the district office should quickly correct this when compiling household registration and Baojia. (Zhanyuan)

### Business Expenses Not Yet Determined

Editor: In the "Reader Opinions" column on July 31, "What is a Business Expense?" it was stated that the Xiang Bao chief of Xinzhong Township, Xueyanqiao, Wujin, had already determined to levy a field donation this summer. Now, according to insiders, there is no such thing as a field donation. Under orders, military grain was purchased, but it has now been exempted from collection by the central government, and the military wheat that had been collected has been returned separately. As for the business expenses, they include three types of expenses: district office administrative expenses, township office operating expenses, and education subsidy expenses. It was resolved by the Wujin Eighth District Office District Affairs Meeting on June 15 to levy them at the same time as the military grain. Among them, the district expenses and education expenses require a levy of eight market catties of wheat per mu (about four and a half liters) to be able to supplement them. Now, it is proposed to levy five liters of wheat per mu, so the operating expenses of the township office are less than half a liter, and the income is very little. Even with frugality, there are still concerns about insufficient expenditure, so how can we talk about extravagant spending? At present, whether this business expense can be collected is still a problem. I am afraid that fellow villagers abroad do not understand the truth, so I hope to disclose it to dispel public doubts. (Yin Xiang)

### Sheltering Drug-Addicted Beggars on the Streets

It has been almost a year since the victory. Although the government has strictly prohibited drugs, there are still many drug-addicted beggars entrenched in some alleys and lanes of this city, haggard and tattered. This city is an international metropolis, which hinders the appearance of the city and causes criticism. However, it is believed that most of these beggars lack education, are willing to degenerate, and are addicted to this bad habit. It is hoped that the municipal government authorities will thoroughly eradicate drug traffickers and intensify strict handling on one hand, and shelter drug-addicted beggars on the streets and provide them with rehabilitation on the other hand. Then, teach them skills so that they can have a way to make a living. (Jinlong, Beihai Road)

### How is Business Tax Calculated?

To whom it may concern: Our small laundry shop had a total business income of 438,300 yuan in the spring. Calculated according to 15 per thousand, only 6,574.5 yuan of tax was paid. However, on July 30, we received a payment notice from the Direct Tax Bureau, requiring a tax payment of 75,000 yuan, which is very different from the previous number. How is it calculated? The bureau should provide detailed answers to taxpayers. (Da Yu Laundry Shop, Xiamen Road)

### Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places

Editor:

We know the harm of cigarettes. Although it is not as obvious as alcohol, because cigarettes contain nicotine, it is easy to get poisoned after smoking too much. After the victory, we feel that cigarettes are more rampant than before the war, but the "No Smoking" signs in tram cars have been painted over with white paint, and it is even harder to see anyone opposing smoking. So foreign cigarettes are in everyone's hands! We hope that the authorities will ban smoking in public places and on vehicles, just like in the New Life Movement era. (Yao Guoji, Xu Yuyan)

### Special Law on Leases

Editor: In the past, tenants were protected by special laws. For the sake of low rents, they rented one house in the east and another in the west, which was actually more than they needed. But for the sake of low rent, they would not give up the lease, and they could also transfer it, getting a huge amount of money. I don't know why, but the Jiangsu Provincial Government is still sticking to the old ways, issuing a special law on leases, restricting low rents and landlords from refusing to lease and forcing repairs to rented houses. It should be known that restricting low rents will make landlords unwilling to lease because they cannot get considerable interest. The more the property rights of landlords are not protected, the more landlords dare not lease, how can the housing shortage be solved? Since it is not wartime, there is no reason to deprive and restrict, which also violates the law. I wonder what you think, gentlemen? (Xu Ganhan)

### Tanggu New Port After the Takeover

— Special Correspondent Li Shaolin, Tianjin Shipping News, 29th of This Month

After the victory, we took over Tanggu New Port from the enemy. Intelligent people all believe that it is far more worthy of attention than some enemy and puppet factories, or some warehouses of enemy materials, because this is a construction that thoroughly cures Tianjin's throat disease and is related to the trade and transportation of the entire North China. Since last November, we have taken over this port, which has already been operated on to eradicate Tianjin's throat disease but whose surgery has not yet been completed. The initial management organization was the Tanggu New Port Engineering Office under the Tianjin-Beiping District Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications. In April, the Engineering Office was abolished, and the Tanggu New Port Engineering Office directly under the Ministry of Communications was established. The work is being promoted little by little there, but at present they can only do some sorting work. The plan to complete the entire construction is still under study.

(1) A Glimpse of the Past

The reason why Tianjin's throat disease was formed is that Dagukou is blocked by a famous Dagukou Bar, commonly known as Daguba. Five large rivers in Hebei Province converge in Tianjin and flow to Tanggu through the Hai River. There, the flat terrain reduces the flow of the river, and the sediment is deposited, thus forming the bar. This sand blocks the throat, so that ships with a draft of only ten feet or so cannot enter, and the annual throughput of Tianjin City has not exceeded 1.5 million tons for many years. Leaving aside the Japanese's purpose, they established the Tanggu New Port Temporary Office in June of the 28th year of the Republic of China to investigate the port situation. In October of the 29th year, they prescribed the right medicine and started large-scale construction of the New Port on the north bank of the Hai River estuary. The Japanese's initial plan was to make this new port have an annual throughput of 27 million tons, but they finally reduced the plan to 8 million tons.

Before talking about the situation after our takeover, it is worth looking at the Japanese's plan. The New Port is located on the north bank of the Hai River estuary, fifteen miles east of Tanggu. The main project in their plan is the construction of the north and south breakwaters. The south breakwater is 17 kilometers long and parallel to the Hai River. Its main function is to prevent wind and also to prevent the sediment carried by the Hai River from flowing into the port. The function of the north breakwater is to prevent the wind and waves from the northeast and northwest. Between the two breakwaters, a 200-meter-wide channel is dug and maintained at a depth of six meters, connecting it to the Hai River. At the same time, a ship lock 180 meters long and 21 meters wide is built. After this plan is completed, ships with a draft of less than 16 feet can also reach Tianjin directly through the channel with the regulation of the ship lock during low tide, without having to pass through the Dagukou Bar. Regarding the construction of the wharf, the original plan was to fill the base eastward from the east of the ship lock, north of the channel, and then build four wharves and a pier wharf. Ships with a draft of 16 feet to 20 feet can dock at any time during low tide.

(2) Current Situation

The Japanese started construction in October of the 29th year and completed 50% of the north and south breakwater projects, 90% of the first wharf, 60% of the second wharf, 80% of the ship lock project, two coal loaders, and the channel has been widened to 130 feet and the depth is about 5 meters by the time we won the victory. The subsequent processing and regular dredging depends on how we do it. Many experts who observed the New Port believe that those half-completed works should be completed as soon as possible to have utilization value, otherwise the previous efforts will be in vain. In response to this reality, the New Port Engineering Office plans to complete the ancillary works of the ship lock first. In addition to the ship lock itself, this includes four tasks: (1) Dredging the depth of that channel to six meters, (2) Expanding the ship's water supply facilities, (3) Expanding the electrical lighting equipment, (4) Adding navigation markers. The person in charge said: As long as there is money, it can be rushed to completion within four months.

The current work of the New Port Engineering Office, in addition to sorting out those messy materials scattered everywhere, is handling two major events: salvaging ships and restoring the mechanical factory. To date, four tugboats have been salvaged. Regarding repairs, one pump-type dredger, three tugboats, and one water supply ship have been repaired. Under repair are two pump-type dredgers, one grab-type dredger, and three tugboats. The mechanical factory was restored in May. All ship repair work is directed by the mechanical factory, and most of the parts needed for the ship lock have also been manufactured by the factory. The person in charge of the New Port Engineering Office has agreed with the chief engineer from Nanjing and has stirred up a group of engineering experts from various places. Building a port is an examination and an opportunity for expression. It is time to see our construction.

(3) New Port Plan

What kind of new port do we want? Colonel Dodd, the American advisor to the National Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, drafted an improvement plan. The main parts of this plan are five points: (1) Complete and strengthen the breakwaters, using large pieces of stone weighing five to ten tons in the deep water parts. (2) Complete and deepen the channel so that ships with a draft of less than 20 feet can enter the port. (3) Complete the construction of the ship lock. (4) Complete the construction of the first and second wharves. (5) Complete the loading and unloading equipment, and necessary railway, highway, lighting, water supply, and other equipment. The entire project is based on an annual throughput of 2 million tons. The budget for the project is 50 billion yuan.

(4) Three Opinions

Mr. Xue Zhuobin, Chief Engineer of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, proposed an engineering plan for an annual throughput of 1.5 million tons after inspecting the port. He advocated first digging the channel to a depth of six meters and a width of 130 feet, which is enough, and there is no need to widen it to 200 feet, but he believed that a mooring area 700 meters long and 300 meters wide should be dug opposite the first wharf, south of the channel and in the middle of the south breakwater, and set up nine sets of large and small buoys so that it can moor seven ships of about 3,000 tons and two ships of about 10,000 tons, using barges to assist in loading and unloading. In addition, it is necessary to complete the ship lock and the necessary equipment on the shore, and it is not planned to process the breakwater. The engineering cost of this plan is 19 billion yuan. The New Port Engineering Office also has its own plan, hoping to have an annual throughput of 8 million tons. In addition to completing those half-completed projects taken over, it is also preparing to complete the third, fourth and pier wharves. Based on the prices in May, it requires an engineering cost of 99 billion yuan and takes three and a half years. The above three plans are being jointly considered.

People who come back from the New Port are touched by the encounter of this construction when they see those buildings waiting to be rescued and those materials scattered everywhere. It has been almost a year since the victory, and it will be eight or nine months since it was taken over, and it is suffering from hunger like a refugee. The unstable sea is taking advantage of the unstable situation, eroding those dilapidated long dykes day and night. Who can let the sea calm down?

### Our Fleet in Havana

— Havana, Pearl Harbor Shipping News, July 9, Qiuping

The main reason is that it is too far away from the motherland. The environment does not require a overseas Chinese child to study the language and writing of the motherland, and teachers are also a problem. In Havana, overseas Chinese who are slightly familiar with the writing of the motherland are rare, and even fewer can speak Mandarin.

Then he invited us to his home. This is an affluent and respected family of overseas Chinese. A portrait of President Chiang Kai-shek hangs in the living room, and on the other side are pictures of Guan Yu, Guan Ping, and Zhou Cang. Two pots of fresh flowers are placed on the corridor. This is like a clean and elegant family commonly seen in China.

His mother is a middle-aged woman who likes to wear cheongsams and speaks elegantly. She greeted us thoughtfully. She hopes that her beloved son will soon be able to return to the motherland, receive higher education in the motherland, and be able to serve the motherland.

"Our generation has not contributed enough to the motherland. The next generation should dedicate themselves to the motherland," she said with a smile and humility in Cantonese, expressing her inner wish.

This is the sincere love of the entire overseas Chinese for the motherland, and time has not made them (or her) forget the motherland. They are children of China, and their hearts still belong to China. He did not forget us! How can we forget them?

In the evening, the teacher accompanied us to the Hualai Restaurant for a hearty and delicious authentic Chinese meal. Since going abroad, watching Chinese operas and going to Chinese restaurants has become the only hobby, perhaps because exiles miss their homes. After the meal, we argued with him about paying, but his sincerity and hospitality finally won us over. However, the restaurant owner also refused to accept his payment, saying that it was the duty and right of every overseas Chinese to entertain the navy of the motherland. After such an unexpected treat, we dared not go to overseas Chinese restaurants again. Even if we wanted to buy some sundries, we would first look carefully to see if there were any words "Welcome Chinese Navy" at the door.

### Cuban President Inspects Marching Troops

The program for the twelfth was the Cuban President's inspection of the marching troops and participation in the unveiling ceremony of the Overseas Chinese Monument.

The marching soldiers were transported by ten brand-new transport vehicles to gather in the Chinese district. The front of the team was the Cuban Navy Band, the rear was the Chinese Band, and the middle was the flag guard, led by a motorcycle police team. From the Chinese district in a crowded alley, they passed through the city center and marched all the way to the Presidential Palace. Following closely behind the Chinese band were the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Overseas Chinese Delegation, elementary school students, and overseas Chinese women. The orderly and long marching team was unprecedented in Havana in recent years. Everywhere the team went, traffic was blocked, the music was majestic, the steps were sonorous, raising their heads, sticking out their chests, looking straight ahead, teams connected one after another, as if connected by a thread, applause and praise chased the team, resounding throughout the beautiful Havana.

As the team approached the Presidential Palace, the crowd watching on both streets became more crowded. The motorcycle security team, with wheels and black leather boots shining in the sun, honked their horns and patrolled back and forth along the sidewalk. People crowded down on the sidewalk and were squeezed back again.

When the team passed the Presidential Palace, the officer leading the team gave the command to "Look to the right."

Cuban President Grau and the First Lady of Cuba on the balcony nodded in response, accompanied by Minister Li and Commander Lin of the Chinese Fleet. On the square in front of the mansion, the ancient Navy Band played one majestic and exciting military music after another.

When the flag guard passed by, the band changed to the Chinese national anthem. The President and the accompanying officers stood at attention and saluted the national flag, and the surrounding crowd quickly took off their hats and stood in silence, paying their respects, holding their breath, only hearing the sound of the waves hitting the Atlantic coast and the military music, lingering in people's hearts, making people feel majestic and solemn.

The crowd followed the team, bypassing the seaside road to the Overseas Chinese Monument. It was already noon, and sweat dripped from the edge of their inner shirts, but our heads were always held high. We are a young team, we are trained.

Perhaps because of our youth, our will is not inferior to others.

First, Minister Li and the Cuban president delivered speeches one after another, praising the special merits of the overseas Chinese in the Cuban independence movement, the development of Sino-Cuban friendly relations, and the significance of the Chinese Navy's visit.

In the long Spanish speech, I heard many words such as "China and Cuba," "war," and "victory." The content of the speech was told to me afterwards by an overseas Chinese.

On the 13th, the escort destroyers Taikang and Taiping were open to the public. People from China and the West came and went in an endless stream at the San Francisco Wharf. The queue waiting to visit stretched from the berth to the gate, and there was also a crowd squeezing in the center of the street trying to get in to visit.

My Cantonese classmate Deng and I accompanied a group of young overseas Chinese and three Cuban female students to visit the wharf, but we couldn't get in. Fortunately, in a moment, a small launch from the ship came to wait for the transportation of food, so we boarded the launch and circled the port to board the flagship. Overseas Chinese representatives maintained order at the dock, and sentries on the ship indicated the tour route. The tour area was limited to the deck and bridge.

Deng explained the nouns and functions of each part to the overseas Chinese in Cantonese. I accompanied the three Cuban students to visit each gun position. Because I was a gunner, I explained the range, operation, and effectiveness of each gun in detail in English, from three-inch guns, four-centimeter machine guns, two-centimeter anti-aircraft machine guns to the depth charges at the stern.

When we came down from the ship, the crowd outside the gate had not decreased. We walked along the embankment and took a few photos with the ships anchored in the port as the background. They told us about the situation at the University of Cuba, and we described some of our life at sea. Along with the sound of the waves, we sang until the evening, when the white sails brought in the sunset, and the setting sun teased the sea to blush.

Classical Dance in America

Female students at Cornell University in the United States learn dance outside of class, and their activities are almost indistinguishable from dance clubs. This dance is called "A Woman's Walk," which depicts the posture of the wife of an American fisherman in ancient times (the colonial era) waiting for her husband to return from overseas.

### Chinese Chamber of Commerce Holds a Ball

At ten o'clock in the evening, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a ball to entertain the fleet officers. The Kuomintang and Zhi Gong Party branches also separately held cocktail dance parties to entertain the soldiers.

With diligent hospitality and affectionate smiles, tonight's attendees were even more crowded than last night. Embroidered Spanish-style long skirts brushed against white trousers as couples leaned close and silently waltzed.

The sound of yesterday's turbulent waves was drowned out by laughter. Tomorrow seemed so far away. How many people found interpretations of love in tender gazes? Words and writings were so powerless!

At the ball, through the introduction of the editor of the Zhi Gong Party's Jianming Public Report, I met a Cuban lady of nobility. Her elegant demeanor and fluent conversation made her seem like a sociable noblewoman at a Parisian banquet. She was the secretary of the Cuban Women's Federation and expressed with grace that it was an unparalleled honor to attend the welcome dance party for the Chinese Navy. She also said that she studied space abroad in university, and then explained that this seemed to be a common situation of insufficient progress worldwide, which was precisely the reason she took on the role of secretary of the Women's Federation.

Inside, light and lively Spanish music swelled. Outside, pairs of figures sat together, smiling, nodding, their eyes in conversation. In the quiet, beautiful night of the port city, unspoken feelings rippled across the night sky.

A burst of enthusiastic applause greeted the arrival of Minister Li and Commander Lin, escorted by Zhu Jia Zhao, the chairman of the Zhi Gong Hall. The music did not stop, throwing laughter and attention towards them. Staff Officer Xu began to sing "When Will You Return?" Its gentle lyrics, like autumn rain, sprinkled on the hearts of the young.

After the song ended, the young people began to busy themselves, exchanging gifts and keeping contact information. Tomorrow, the waves will carry us further away, but the memory will always be vivid.

"Farewell, Havana, the beautiful resort of Central America, farewell, beautiful ladies (Seuovta Bonita), sons and daughters of China!"

The sound of engines cut through the lingering farewells, and waving handkerchiefs disappeared into the dawn. Gazing at the white buildings rising and falling in the waves, someone on the deck softly sang "Accidentally": "I am a cloud in the sky, occasionally projected onto your rippling heart. You don't need to be surprised, nor do you need to be happy, in this instant, I disappear without a trace. You and I meet on the dark sea, you have your direction, I have mine. Whether you remember or you forget, it is best to forget, in this encounter, the light we mutually release."

(I) Escaping the Difficulties

The fact that the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory in Pukou has been able to survive to this day and work for the reconstruction of our country was unimaginable before the end of the War of Resistance. This factory has escaped destruction three times. The first time was during the Battle of Shanghai, with enemy planes bombing it a total of four times. However, due to the enemy's poor technology, the main parts of the factory were not damaged. The second time was when the factory staff evacuated on December 20th, 1937. Due to the urgency, they only took away some valuable parts and did not carry out large-scale destruction. The third possible destruction was on the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance; to be precise, after the establishment of the Hwa-Shih Super Fortress base in April 1944. According to a friend of the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory, at that time, the American Embassy officially sent someone to meet Mr. Fan Xudong, requesting various photos of the factory for reference in implementing strategic bombing. Mr. Fan generously sent all the photos and painfully expressed to people that he would rebuild an ammonia factory after the war instead of restoring the old factory because he could not bear to see the tragic state of rubble. Later, the U.S. Air Force had been over the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory, and they must have recognized the target, but they only fired a row of machine guns at the gas plant without dropping any bombs. Thus, the Yongli factory escaped destruction again. In less than a few months, the enemy surrendered unconditionally. Due to the regulations for accepting the surrender, they were responsible for safekeeping and did not dare to destroy it at will. The Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory was finally returned intact. A few days ago, two foreign experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) came to visit the ammonia factory. Afterwards, they told people that they had inspected industries all over China, including Taiwan. The speed of resuming work after the takeover and the enthusiasm of the staff were unmatched by any other factory except Yongli. At the same time, the factory's scale and modern equipment also made the ammonia factory second to none. Today, the author is on the scene and has witnessed the factory's grand scale and the staff's high enthusiasm. He also deeply feels that this factory is truly the elite of Chinese industry. Its existence is truly due to the blessing of fate, otherwise, with the current financial difficulties of the national treasury, wanting to assist industrialists in running such a large-scale factory, one does not know when it could be successfully done!

(II) Purpose of Establishing the Factory

The purpose of establishing the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory was national defense first, and the people's livelihood second. After the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), the Central District had established a national policy of self-reliance as the basis for self-strengthening and repentance. The ammonia factory was also a product of this national policy, although in nature it was a private industrial enterprise. In 1933, the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek) summoned Mr. Fan Xudong to discuss the grand plan of building the factory. This outstanding industrialist expressed at the time that he was willing to do his best for the country, but the capital required for the ammonia factory was enormous. In terms of fundraising, government assistance was needed. Secondly, he strongly disagreed with joint government-business operation and advocated government supervision and private management. These two requests were immediately adopted at the time. The decision to locate it in Pukou was also the intention of the authorities. The reason was nothing more than proximity to the capital for easy supervision, and also to facilitate visits from foreign guests, so that they would have an unforgettable impression of the determination of the new China to build. In 1934, the factory construction officially began. At that time, the Yongli Company issued corporate bonds worth 15 million yuan, with the government guaranteeing the principal and interest, and underwritten by major banks. In terms of technical design, it was presided over by American engineers. A friend of Yongli told me that this was a very specialized job. At that time, there were only three countries that built ammonium sulfate factories—China, Japan, and the Soviet Union. China's factory was in Pukou, Japan's factory was in Dalian (twice the size of ours), and the Soviet Union's factory was in Europe. And those responsible for the design were all these American technicians. In the following two years, the Yongli staff worked with the greatest enthusiasm. Due to their efforts, China's factory was the first to succeed. In February 1937, the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory officially started operation.

Before the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident), the products of the Yongli Ammonia Factory were ammonia, not sulfuric acid or nitric acid, because they did not want to compete with the small and medium-sized factories in the country. At that time, they were worried about the sales of ammonia because the goods of the British company Brunner Mond & Co. had always controlled the market. But facts proved that these were unnecessary worries. At that time, Yongli signed contracts with Guangdong and Fujian provinces, undertaking the sales of all the factory's products. Jiangsu, where the factory was located, could not buy Yongli's fertilizer. After a considerable period of time, it was proven that the quality of Yongli's goods was better than imported goods. First, imported goods traveled across the ocean, and were easily affected by moisture. Second, the nitrogen content of Yongli's goods was 0.8% higher than imported goods. Therefore, the reputation of the ammonia factory was established, and even with a daily output of 150 tons, it was still in short supply. When the War of Resistance broke out, the ammonia factory immediately became a national defense industry, producing more than 100 tons of sulfuric acid and nitric acid daily, supplying military needs. At that time, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent a commissioner to be stationed in the factory for liaison purposes. What was regrettable was that Yongli's service to the War of Resistance was very short. On November 20th, 1937, as the military situation deteriorated, the factory staff were ordered to evacuate completely. I once asked a friend of Yongli: Why didn't they thoroughly destroy the factory or move away the main parts so that they could build a factory in the rear? Their explanation was: In terms of thorough destruction, the evacuation was too hasty. At that time, in order to supply military needs, production continued until the last day. At the same time, the factory's scale was very large, and thorough destruction required sufficient time and technical preparation, which was not allowed by the situation at the time. As for moving the machines, it was even out of the question at that time. Because the ammonia factory's machines were too large and too heavy, for example, one synthesizer of the compressor part was cast from a mixed steel and weighed 108 tons. When this machine was shipped from the United States, the largest crane on the Shanghai wharf could only lift 50 tons of goods. It was Yongli Company who made a 100-ton crane themselves that solved the problem. In times of war emergency, transportation was impossible. And at that time, the conditions of Yangtze River transportation made moving the factory impossible. Regarding the first reason, I am ashamed to say that I have no engineering expertise and dare not express an opinion. Regarding the second reason, after seeing the scale of the ammonia factory and thinking about the situation of the factories moving to Sichuan in the rear, I believe that it was indeed unavoidable. It was certainly an unpleasant thing for the factory to be used by the enemy. However, after the victory, the country was able to completely recover a large-scale modern factory. From an industrialization point of view, it can be considered a gratifying thing. People who visit this factory are probably bound to have this feeling!

After the Yongli Ammonia Factory fell into enemy hands, the enemy attached considerable importance to it and actively used it. A group of Japanese engineers with very good standards participated in the work, and the dismantled parts were also repaired using Japanese methods. To this day, the Japanese-made hand-cranked centrifuge still remains in the ammonia factory as a souvenir of the enemy's occupation. The nitric acid factory's machines in the ammonia factory were dismantled by the enemy and transported to mainland Japan, because these machines were particularly sophisticated and their quality exceeded the enemy's own equipment. After Japan surrendered, these machines have been discovered. Yongli has now petitioned the government to forward the case to General MacArthur's headquarters to find a way to transport them back. At the same time, Yongli Ammonia Factory has opened a clear list of the losses during the war. In the future, it hopes to obtain a portion from the Japanese compensation amount and plans to send personnel to Japan to assist in the negotiations. This is a very reasonable request and should be supported by the government and society. However, judging from the Allied Headquarters' attitude towards Japan, it is questionable whether the compensation request can be achieved.

During the period of enemy occupation, the production volume of the ammonia factory was significantly reduced because the Yongli staff had dismantled some valuable parts when they evacuated. The enemy used the factory but did not cherish it. The reason was that the enemy knew that they could not occupy Central China for a long time and regard it as their own property, so they could not intentionally maintain and develop it. Therefore, the depreciation and loss rate of the ammonia factory in the past eight years has been particularly high. From January of this year, a full six months was used for repairs. The sulfuric acid factory only shipped goods on the 25th of last month. The high-pressure department is currently being tested, and full resumption of work should be around the 15th of next month. In each factory, traces of repairs can be seen everywhere.

(III) Opening Up a Path

The Yongli Ammonia Factory has been moving towards the road to revival due to the enthusiasm and efforts of all the factory staff. However, due to the destruction of eight years, the vitality has been greatly damaged. According to a senior staff member, the daily production of sulfuric acid is about 60 tons. According to an engineering staff member, the maximum daily production of ammonia can reach 80 tons. According to responsible persons, the sales prospects are optimistic. The ammonia goods have not yet been released, but there are already many people placing orders. Taiwan needs fertilizer for fields in one year.

The biggest problem in Yongli's production now is the supply of raw materials, that is, coal is too difficult. They said that the ammonia factory needs to use more than 7,000 tons of coal per month, which is a considerable amount today. Because the Zhongfu Coal Mine and Zaozhuang Coal Mine are in the hands of the Communist army, coal from other regions cannot be supplied regularly for a long time. They had to seek it abroad. They ordered 8,000 tons of coal in Canada, and the price was more than 200,000 yuan per ton, plus freight and other expenses, costing more than 2 billion. Before starting work, Yongli Ammonia Factory's expenses were huge, and it could not be maintained without national subsidies. Recently, the Four Joint Treasury approved a loan of 3 billion yuan, 2 billion was released by the Bank of China, and the remaining 1 billion yuan was loaned by the Bank of Communications. This is a considerable industrial loan, and Yongli colleagues also admit that the country treats them differently. As for President Chiang himself, he also cares about Yongli from time to time. After returning to Nanjing, when summoning the military commander of the area, he frequently inquired about Yongli's recent situation and expressed his willingness to visit.

High prices are really a big obstacle to industrial production. In the ammonia factory, I saw magnetic cans for sulfuric acid, about two feet high and less than one foot in diameter, but their properties are special and not eroded by concentrated acid. They said that they cost more than 40,000 yuan per can, and you can't buy them even if you have the money! Wuhu's sand is also a necessity. There, one cubic meter costs 90,000 yuan, which is really shocking. The insurance period for the Yongli Ammonia Factory's machines has expired. They are now using them carefully, fearing that something will happen, but at this stage, there is no question of re-equipping. I asked them: Do you hope to borrow money from the country again? The answer was that borrowing money is not a solution because the interest is too high. They hope to open up sales channels, which is the real way out. They deeply expressed their heartache about the current situation and transportation conditions, believing that they can strangle industry!

(IV) Equipment in the Factory

The Yongli Ammonia Factory is located in Xiejiadian, Pukou, about forty miles away from Xiaguan, and can be reached by boat in forty minutes downstream. The factory site covers an area of more than 1,000 acres and includes various important parts such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, ammonia, high-pressure, gas, foundry, repair, civil engineering, and water refining plants. The distance between each plant is very large, which is a major reason for the lack of major losses from air raids. There are currently more than 200 employees and about 1,500 workers in the factory. In addition, there are two American engineers, in the name of consultants, one of whom is an old friend of Mr. Fan Xudong and has worked in the Yongli Company for more than ten years. Although the design of the ammonia factory was presided over by American engineers, the machines are not entirely American goods. The standard for purchasing them is entirely based on quality and characteristics. Therefore, within one factory, there are machines produced in four or five countries. In the high-pressure department, I saw the synthesizer from the United States and the compressor from Germany, as well as goods from Sweden and the United Kingdom. The engineering staff in the factory told me that even though it has been eight years, if this factory were moved to a foreign country, it would still be a new factory in terms of machinery and equipment, and its products would not be inferior to others.

One of the characteristics of this factory is stability. The workers have not had any labor disputes. The reasons for this are, first, the treatment is reasonable, and wages are adjusted according to the index at any time; however, the biggest reason is that the welfare is well-managed, and technical workers can be assigned family dormitories. I visited the single workers' dormitory, and the building, light, and air in the rooms are probably better than the residences of some public school staff in Nanjing. As for the welfare of the staff, it is certainly managed even better. Yongli's staff has never shared dividends, and the treatment is not as good as state-owned enterprises, but it can make the staff work with peace of mind and not be tempted to move to other places. Well-managed welfare has a great relationship. Another important reason is that Mr. Fan Xudong's personality is noble and his leadership is effective. He was the cohesive force for uniting Yongli when he was alive, and the staff of Yongli still miss him today. This old industrialist expressed during the War of Resistance that he wanted to build a factory with a daily output of 1,300 tons of acid after the war. He believed that this production number was most suitable for China's needs. On the eve of the victory, President Chiang summoned him several times, hoping that he could run ten more modern factories for the country and asked him to prepare more. His early death was a loss to the Yongli factory and a loss to society. According to my intuition, Mr. Fan's memories are still Yongli's cohesive force and driving force today.

There is a hospital in the factory. The green walls are very pleasing to the eye and give people a quiet feeling. There is a primary school for the children of the employees to attend school for free, and it also enrolls the children of poor people nearby for free. The factory also has a farm, which is used for experiments. The fertilizer produced in the factory is first tested on this farm to test its power.

(V) Business Prospects

The overall business prospects of Yongli are very bright and optimistic. One reason is the soundness of its own conditions, and the second is that it has established international and domestic credibility, making it easier to obtain sympathy and assistance for both maintenance and development. From the United States, they have already obtained a loan of 16 million US dollars. The purpose is to designate the development of the alkali industry. Yongli is preparing to use this as capital to build ten new factories, focusing on Zhuzhou, Hunan, purchasing 3,000 acres of land to build seven new factories, and placing the remaining three factories and today's ammonia factory in one place. Yongli has a very sound business policy that is worth referring to by our country's industrial circles: their shareholders never share dividends, and if there are profits, they are used to expand the business. This kind of entrepreneurial spirit with a long-term vision is commendable. We study the history of China and Japan and find that Japan's industrial development was about the same time as ours, but today, the degree of industrialization in the two countries is very different. The reasons are certainly not just one end, but the lack of entrepreneurial spirit is indeed our major weakness. During the First World War, the textile industries of both countries had unprecedented prosperity, but Japanese textile mills set aside a particularly large public reserve fund, while Chinese textile mills focused on sharing dividends. As a result, when the trend of recession came, Japanese factories were still able to stand their ground, while Chinese factories collapsed at the first sign of trouble. Therefore, Yongli's style of valuing business over profit is worth greatly advocating in China.

When Mr. Fan Xudong was alive, the management of Yongli's business was based on people-oriented rather than law-oriented. There were no rigid written laws, but they were used freely and everything could be done. The responsibilities of each part of the company were not absolutely clearly defined, and there were no fixed rules for the appointment and protection of staff. However, under the guidance of Mr. Fan's selfless spirit, the internal personnel of the company were coordinated and full of vitality. Now that Mr. Fan has passed away, the need for the rule of law has begun to be felt. Yongli's business already has a grand scale and a long history. To carry it forward, it is not enough to rely solely on good traditions; systematization is the guarantee of success.

Social Service

### Father's Day "Scholarship" Collective Donations Are More Effective

The owner of the Jialin Loan Fund advocates raising more education and upbringing fees for the Xie family's children.

The main task of the Father's Day Promotion Committee this year is to raise scholarships. The more donations, the more impoverished children will benefit. The number of people responding in the past few days has been quite enthusiastic, but the amount of pledged donations is still limited. It is hoped that those who are well-fed and clothed will generously donate and that those who are enthusiastic about helping students will do their best to solicit donations. Whether they donate money or effort, their efforts to help students are equally effective. Speaking of commemorating fathers, since it is everyone's wish, wouldn't it be more worthy of fathers to donate a little money to help the orphaned and distressed youth? Not only should everyone think this way, but if every group, such as lines of shops and companies, commercial firms, factories, hometown associations, clubs... cooperated with the power of the majority, wouldn't it be easy to achieve? Therefore, I hope that donating scholarships for Father's Day must use the collective power to easily achieve results. I heard that the association plans to help 500 primary and secondary school students, requiring at least 50 million yuan, and hopes to achieve the goal in a short period of time.

The owner of the Jialin Loan Fund came to the museum in person yesterday. He was deeply moved by the proposal of the promotion committee to provide 1 million yuan for the education expenses of General Xie Jinyuan's children. He proposed that our newspaper set up a special column on the education fund for General Xie's children so that readers can donate according to their abilities with a spirit of self-motivation. He first donated 100,000 yuan as an initiative. With the approval of the authorities of our newspaper, we will follow Mr. Zhu's wishes. All readers who donate and designate it for the education expenses of General Xie's children can state it incidentally. Our newspaper will notify the promotion committee after collecting the donations, regardless of the amount, and handle it separately. It is indeed a good thing to commemorate Father's Day and help the descendants of the soldiers who resisted Japan. It is hoped that readers will pay attention to it.

### Reader Responses - Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Mr. Wu Shizeng asks the editor: I am a poor civil servant with a family of six to support. To make matters worse, my wife is suffering from an inexplicable ailment. Last month, she suddenly started vomiting and experiencing constipation. A traditional Chinese medicine practitioner diagnosed it as dampness obstructing the stomach and intestines, while a Western doctor diagnosed it as a gastrointestinal disease. After taking medication, she improved slightly, but to this day, her menstruation has not returned, she continues to vomit, feels discomfort in her chest when eating, often regurgitates acidic fluids, and has irregular bowel movements. She has become as thin as a rail. If this continues, I fear I will not be able to find a solution. If I were to seek further medical treatment, my financial resources would be insufficient. I have long admired your newspaper for benefiting the people and for employing medical consultants. I humbly submit this request, hoping you can provide guidance. I would be eternally grateful.

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] Your wife should first have her urine tested to determine if she is pregnant, and then have her stool examined to confirm what type of gastrointestinal disease she has.

(2) Zhou Xiaoyin asks: I read your newspaper, "Shen Bao," and found that the consultants provide many detailed solutions to readers' problems, benefiting humanity greatly and gaining widespread admiration. I have two questions and would like to request your assistance in answering them. In recent years, I have been deeply engrossed in medicine in my spare time, but I lack a good teacher and rely solely on self-study. However, this is only due to my personal interest and not a plan to practice medicine on others. I previously took a correspondence course in medicine from Mr. Zhang Zongxi and benefited greatly. Now that Mr. Zhang is no longer in Shanghai, I am relying on self-study. Knowing your enthusiasm for society, I implore you to provide more guidance.

Various medical communities worldwide have relied heavily on Sulfanilamide for saving lives, truly a boon for humanity. It has many derivatives, such as Sulfapyridine, Sulfathiazole, and others. Even Diafaguanai Ding has specific effects. However, I am unsure of the specific effects of Diafada Jing and Diafa Milajing, which are currently available in the market. Which types of bacteria are they most effective against? I implore you to provide detailed information on the efficacy of Diafada Jing and Diafa Milajing, which I will never forget. Also, please recommend relevant Chinese books, newspapers, and publications (medical category).

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] Sulfadiazine is extremely effective in killing gonococci, staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci, and other bacteria. Its efficacy is similar to Sulfathiazole, but its toxicity is lower. Sulfameazine has similar efficacy, but its toxicity to the human body is even lower. Some readily available periodical Chinese medical publications include the Chinese Medical Journal and Social Hygiene.

(3) Qian Tingxi asks: Last winter night, I was robbed and fled in panic. Unfortunately, I fell from the roof and was injured. Although I have recovered, the doctor did not examine whether my reproductive organs were injured. Therefore, even though I am physically healed, I have completely lost my sexual desire and urinate more frequently. This has been going on for half a year. I am concerned about the potential impact on the issue of inheritance. I dare to humbly ask the following questions for your guidance: (1) What is the reason for the loss of sexual desire? (2) Can it be cured, and what are the methods? (3) If left untreated, is there any hope for improvement?

[Dr. Zhang Shenming answers] Your condition is likely caused by nerve damage to the sexual organs due to the fall. A thorough examination is required before treatment can begin.

### Jialin Scholarship Association Continues to Support the Orphan and Widow Fund

Advocating for Continued Support to Help People in Need

Having read in your column, "Appeal to All Sectors to Donate to the Qingxia Elderly Orphan and Poor Relief Fund," I learned that the remaining funds are only 130,000 yuan, while the needs of the applicants are very great. Our organization also hopes that the relief fund will continue to be held to meet urgent needs. Therefore, we are sending an additional check for 100,000 yuan to be included in the management of the fund. Shen Bao Social Service Column Jialin Scholarship Office, August 3.

### How to Handle Children of Divorced Parents?

— Not Yet 成 (Cheng)

My younger brother came back from a friend's house and told me, "The little sister in that family said to me, 'None of you men are any good.'"

It's a terrible thing for a little girl of just over six years old to utter such words as "None of you men are any good!" It's not just terrible that she said the words, but that she even has such an extreme view in her mind!

Where does this view come from? I firmly believe it comes from her mother. I know the details of her family situation. This child's mother is the passive party in the divorce. After the divorce, the child is raised by the mother. Moreover, I once heard her mother say with my own ears, "There are no good men!"

Divorce, when a couple absolutely cannot continue living together, is an enlightened, correct, and wise decision. However, we believe that the reasons for divorce are often due to incompatibility in the sexual lives of the couple, often with a third party involved, and rarely without some sexual issues. To put it plainly, it is caused by one of the spouses having found someone else they love. The one who has found someone else becomes cold, even disgusted, towards their original spouse, which inevitably leads to jealousy and so-called "green-eyed monster" in the other spouse. Disgust, jealousy, and some unimportant factors add up to arguments, which is the "incompatible views," and "difficult to grow old together" mentioned above. Therefore, in a divorce, there must be one party who is proactive and another who is passive. - Here, "proactive" does not refer to the one who says "Let's get a divorce" first, and "passive" does not refer to the one who says "Fine, let's get a divorce." Here, the proactive party refers to the one who truly caused the divorce - the proactive party only feels that the previous one could not satisfy them, that this new one must be the best, and that they will be completely satisfied when they become a couple - in reality, this is rarely the case, but that is what they think at the time. What about the passive party, the one who is abandoned? Their first feelings are sadness, disappointment, and jealousy! ... These feelings trigger the "lost dream," the memories of past tenderness, sweet talk, and sweetness flood the brain, and they feel that their spouse is unreliable, that everything before was just a scam! And so, from the depths of their heart, a kind of uncontrollable emotion erupts: hatred. They hate not only their fate, but also their own foolishness and stupidity, their spouse's lover, and especially their own spouse! Hatred needs to be vented! The strong will devote themselves to their careers or start a dissolute life, while the weak will begin to sink: chanting Buddhist scriptures, believing in Jesus... or even committing suicide. There are also some who find an object: their own child. (If the child is left with them.) This is especially common with women. They tell the child things that make them hate their husband. It's still alright if the child is older, but if the child is still young, it's terrible! The child's spirit and mind are immediately injured, not just slightly, but with a lifelong mental disability if not treated early.

Objectively speaking, divorce is ultimately an unfortunate thing. But we cannot, and should not, allow the aftermath of this misfortune to strike or kill their children even more heavily! - Like the girl mentioned above, she may distrust men for the rest of her life and even develop abnormal ideas about remaining single!

So, how should we handle the children of divorced parents?

We believe that the love of parents for their children is the most precious thing. A child who does not receive or lacks the love of their parents - especially maternal love - is the most unfortunate person in the world. Their spirit and mind rarely have no defects or abnormalities. Therefore, we do not advocate completely cutting off contact between the child and their parents! But we also do not advocate treating the child as a compensation item, the solution, "Alright, you are too sad, I'll give you the child." We cannot sacrifice the child for our own satisfaction in taking a step back, we would rather sacrifice ourselves to ensure the child's well-being! The psychology of the abandoned is always abnormal. Abnormal psychology produces abnormal love and abnormal education. The result of the child suffering from these influences is a sickness - the above is one example. Based on this, we do not agree with giving the child to the abandoned party.

If the proactive party in the divorce is the woman, this is suitable. Not only has her psychology not changed significantly, but she also continues to love her child. And her "new husband" will never object in order to please his beloved wife. Even if she has other children, it will still be the same, because these are all children she gave birth to herself.

However, if the proactive party in the divorce is the man, should we give the child to the man? We dare not say. A father rarely gives full consideration to his children after remarrying, and the stepmother, who has more contact with the child, only has a nominal relationship with the child. She will not love the child, especially after she has her own children! Discrimination and inequality are common occurrences! These things will cause the child, especially a male child, to develop a similar view to the one mentioned above: "Women are terrible, because Mom was like that." So, who should we give the child to?

Mr. S said: It's best to give the child to a childless widow to raise. This might be a possible solution, but there aren't that many widows, nor is it that convenient. Moreover, widow should only be a temporary title, it should not be a person's lifelong pronoun! She should remarry.

The handling of children of divorced parents is an extremely important matter! It should never be decided casually, just based on "mutual agreement" of who should raise them! Because the child's future is too seriously affected! We need to find the most ideal solution. Do advanced readers also have valuable insights?

### He Loves Mom More - The Miss Dix Advice Column

— Gang Ren (Steel Man)

Dear Miss Dix:

A woman who has just become a bride should be extremely happy, and I am no exception, except for the one thing I am telling you now.

My husband's mother died not long before our marriage. He told me about this, saying that if his mother hadn't died, he would only want to be with his mother and never marry. He even said: He loves his mother much more than he loves me!

It is this that makes me feel sad, because I should hope that I occupy the first position in his heart. Therefore, can you tell me what I should do?

Sincerely, Rand Shang (Rand Up)

Mrs. Rand:

You should be able to use some common sense to stop yourself from creating worry and feeling sad. If it weren't for your husband's steadfast love for his dead mother, you would not have a worse thing in your life to give you something to chew on, you'd be bored quickly.

But I think your husband's comparison of his love for his mother and his love for you is just as wrong and almost foolish as your constant complaint that your husband loves his mom more. Because a man shouldn't compare his love for his mother and his love for his wife; because these are completely two different things, different in both form and nature.

Before his mother died, your husband would have decided not to marry because he hadn't met a woman he felt he loved more deeply.

Therefore, if you can go along the path he wants to take, he will soon feel that his mother's love is not completely satisfying and that he needs a woman's caress.

His stubbornness about his love has become a kind of "disease plagued by demons," just because his mother has died. He overestimates his mother as being so great, so idealized. Therefore, you must never argue with him incessantly over this, showing jealousy or disgust, and should use a more proper method to guide your husband onto the path he should be on. So, you should happily and wisely accept the current situation.

This acceptance is without loss and does not make you lose anything; also, it is more foolish than anything else to continue to create worry for yourself at any time and in any place.

Happily and delightfully give your husband consideration and caresses! Your husband will soon change his prejudice of "seemingly sacred and inviolable ideal love" and return to normal!

### The Unpaid Worker

— Xin (New)

For days, I have been reading Mr. Zhou Shoujuan's "Remembering My Deceased Wife, Fengjun," which has given me a deep feeling. In every corner of China, I don't know how many people like Fengjun continue to work hard and take on complaints, arranging comfortable daily routines for their husbands, enabling them to devote their entire spirit to society and step by step climb to a lofty position. They also do their utmost to educate the country's second generation, creating new talents for the future of the country. They have no name, do not compete for profit, sacrifice personal enjoyment, and just silently, silently, tirelessly, and faithfully serve their families, giving their all and dying only after exhausting their efforts.

As the saying goes, "Establish a home and start a career," which precisely illustrates that starting a career requires the help of a wife. However, society oppresses the status of housewives very low. Even with the women's movement fully underway now, housewives are still being neglected, and some men who don't know the immensity of heaven and earth say that housewives are parasites. I think that if all the housewives in China were to stage a general strike, I wonder if the men would still be able to comfortably and peacefully go to their offices?

Recently, the administrative authorities in Taiwan issued an order prohibiting the family members of civil servants from riding in government cars. It's unimaginable that housewives are so despised. It's said to be for saving government gasoline. But what if the people sitting in the car are unrelated male friends of the civil servant? Does that mean men sitting in the car will reduce gasoline consumption?

Housewives work diligently all day, but society doesn't give them a second glance. Their only hope is to work hard to make their husband's career flourish. By the time their husband has a government car to ride in, he will at least be a senior official or a head of a department. If this were in England, they could have bought several cars themselves long ago. But Chinese official salaries are so meager that it's probably impossible to even hire a maid to share the labor. It's rare to be able to ride in a government car, but even that is prohibited by the government. My husband does not have the qualification to have a government car assigned to him, but I hope that the government will respect these unpaid housewives, at least until the country has universally established nurseries, as they are the sole protectors of the second generation. — Sent from Taipei

Spring and Autumn (Chronicle)

### Glass Slippers (Novel)

— Chi Zhao

Zheng Xia, that nineteen-year-old girl, after graduating from the ×× Church School, came to the Document Section of the ×× Bureau as a staff member in early spring this year.

Although there were quite a few female staff in the ×× Bureau, none of them could attract attention like her. Before she had been at the bureau for three months, she had already become "a household name," and sometimes even became the subject of discussion among her colleagues.

Although she was a staff member, she only did typing work. She wasn't the only female typist, but she was more idle than the others. When she was free, she would chat about everything under the sun. With her around, the cold and lonely office was like a water lily blooming in winter. It was said that she would sometimes sit on the section chief's desk and laugh with her waist bent. She had a personal connection with the section chief, so he introduced her to play a supporting role.

She had dimples, Parisian-style red lips, bright eyes, and a height of four feet seven inches, weighing one hundred and sixteen pounds. Her mother also liked to dress her up, which was said to be the reason why she was so likable.

On the first Monday morning of early summer, Zheng Xia walked to the bureau as usual. As soon as she stepped into the gate, the sound of crisp "click-clack-click" footsteps on the cement floor made people think of the rhythm of a foxtrot on the dance floor. She raised her head, straightened her chest, and walked into the document section, slightly lifting her upper lip to reveal neat teeth, as a greeting to her colleagues.

The office began to come alive, and everyone put their official business on the table, chatting for a while first.

"Miss Zheng, you're wearing new shoes today without reporting it to everyone, you should be fined," said Xiao Chen, who was quick-mouthed and quick-eyed, discovering it during the chat.

Zheng Xia just pursed her lips, turned her head and smiled, and her dimples reappeared.

"Oh! They're American goods, glass slippers!" Lao Qin, who shared a desk with Xiao Chen and sat opposite him, seemed to have seen a miracle.

This news caused a sensation throughout the office. The women cast envious glances, and the men took the opportunity to admire her. Zheng Xia was surrounded by men and women.

"I've heard of them, but I'm only seeing them today."

"I think this is the first pair discovered here."

"You don't read the newspapers, the newspapers say that ×× wore the first pair."

"I thought they were transparent, but now they look just like ordinary ones."

"..."

The tea boy came in and said that the section chief had arrived and was accompanied by the director, which stopped the floating air and made everyone return to their seats and quietly grab their official business to handle.

Hearing that the director had come, Zheng Xia felt that she had nothing to do, so she cleverly grabbed another document from Miss Pan to type.

The director, with a cigar in his mouth, walked in with a smiling section chief. The staff stood up and nodded as a sign of respect, then lowered their heads to work. In the rather quiet atmosphere, only the sound of typewriters and the movement of Zheng Xia's glass slippers, more like a ticking sound, made her feel several gazes shooting at her, making her usually accustomed posture seem clumsy.

After the director's cigar smoke circled the entire room, he said, "Section Chief Guan, I currently need a typist there, just pick one from your section!"

"Yes, yes, Miss Pan is the most hardworking, so let's transfer her to the director's office!" The section chief, with his left hand behind his back, bent over, pointing at Miss Pan with his right hand.

Miss Pan, who wore glasses, was surprised and delighted, and leaned forward to stand up, but the director did not respond, but silently stroked his cheek, grabbed his chin, and his eyes darted elsewhere.

"Oh! I forgot, Miss Zheng is also very good, let Miss Zheng go to the director's office." Seeing the director's eyes on Zheng Xia, the section chief cleverly changed his words.

"That's how it's done!" The director spat out a mouthful of thick smoke and left.

"Yes, yes, yes," the section chief felt a sour feeling rising in his nose.

Xiao Chen and Lao Qin squeezed their eyes and exchanged a knowing look, but Miss Pan's face flushed red, not knowing what to do, and in the end, she sat down and continued typing with her head down.

The next day, Zheng Xia stepped into the gate of ×× Bureau, and the click-clack-click sound echoed on the escalator, and she walked towards the director's office.

"The glass slippers have been promoted!" The colleagues whispered, and from then on, Zheng Xia had an elegant nickname of "Glass Slippers."

She walked to the door of the office, carefully lightened her footsteps, knocked on the door and went in. She saw that the director was already there, smoking a cigar. She felt embarrassed and her face flushed red. She looked down at her watch.

"Director, good morning." She stood in front of the director's desk, bending over slightly.

"It's really early, it's not even office hours yet!" Hearing the director's gentle tone, her uneasy heart calmed down.

"Miss Zheng, please sit down, let's talk first."

She sat on the chair next to the desk, but only sat half of her buttocks. The director sprayed a puff of smoke into the air, put the cigarette butt in the ashtray and said:

"Miss Zheng, where did you study?"

"I went to ×× School."

"Was it co-educational?" The director's expression seemed a little nervous. "No, it was a girls' school." She cleverly emphasized the word "girls."

"Good, good, have you worked there before?"

"No."

"This is good too. Good, Miss Zheng, just help me here, this is your desk," the director pointed to her.

"Thank you, Director!" Zheng Xia felt relaxed again, and her two dimples reappeared. With a click-clack-click sound, she walked to her desk. The director greedily watched her back, "Well-deserved reputation," flickering in his mind.

Zheng Xia sat in the director's office for three days and handled many complex official and private matters. These days, her mother dressed her up even more neatly, and she always remembered the words her mother had told her, but she felt that the opportunity to mature had not yet arrived.

It was Friday, I think. The afternoon office hours were over, and the other staff had slipped away, but Zheng Xia's typing work today was busier than usual, so she couldn't go back, and the director was sitting there without leaving, as if waiting for her official business to be completed that day. After he handed it in, he breathed a sigh of relief and looked at his watch, it was almost seven o'clock.

"You did it very well, but it was hard on Miss Zheng, good, for the merit award, I'll take Miss Zheng out to dinner," the director said, looking at the official documents and glancing at her.

Click-clack-click, the sound of Zheng Xia and the director walking down the escalator of ×× Bureau, dudu dudu, the car drove towards the downtown area.

After dinner, the director and Zheng Xia appeared in ×× Ballroom, because he had learned that she could "bounce" during dinner, which made the director even happier.

"The Whistle in the Dark," this jazz score that had been played in the ballroom for more than ten years, was now being replayed. Under the dim lights, the dance floor was crowded with couples, and he and she were one of them.

Gently, she leaned against his chest, and her nose only smelled the stench of cigars. He hugged her tightly, and she felt his heart pounding rapidly. The shyness of a young girl could not help but push him away slightly.

"Are you having fun dancing?" he said greedily.

"Uh," dimples reappeared on her face, but her chest was further away from him.

"Oh, you also said just now, what does your father do?"

"My dad 'measures roads' for the city government," she smiled, revealing neat teeth.

"You're really clever, and you can talk," he also spewed out the smell of stinky smoke from his mouth, causing her to turn her back.

"Please help me, Director, find a job for my dad."

"What does your father want to do?"

"Investigation Section Chief," she said, leaning against his chest, a heat warming his whole body.

"Hmm!" He only made a heavy tone in contemplation.

"Director, will you help?" She moved her chest away from him again.

"Hmm! Hmm! Okay, let's do it this way!" They danced even more vigorously.

On Saturday, ×× Bureau had a partial change. Hu Dayue, the original investigation section chief, was promoted to commissioner, and Zheng Shide was appointed as the section chief.

After getting off work, Zheng Xia click-clack-click walked home, revealing the dimples on her face. She first told her parents the news of the appointment, saying that Dad could go to work on Monday, which made her mother exclaim:

"Good girl, you finally found a way out for Dad, and it's not in vain that Mom and Dad raised you and loved you."

Her dad was silent at first, feeling guilty in his heart, but when he pondered the benefits of that position, he couldn't help but show a smile against his will.

Then, Zheng Xia was busy dressing up again, saying that the director was taking her to dinner again tonight, which made her dad blush and put away his smile, but Mom helped her pack.

Zheng Xia didn't come home until Sunday morning. She only nodded when she met her parents, and the room suddenly showed an unharmonious atmosphere. Dad's face was gloomy, and Mom was speechless. In the end, Mom pushed her into the room. When she got into the room, her virgin heart, which had not yet been extinguished, made her hatefully take off the glass slippers and still keep them far away. As if regretting, as if shy, she lay on the bed and sobbed.

### Paul Bourget (Part 1)

— Xi Shou

Paul Bourget was born on September 2, 1852, in Amiens, Somme, France. His father, Justin Bourget, was a Bachelor of Science, his grandfather was a civil engineer, and his great-grandfather was a farmer. On the maternal side, his mother was from Lorraine, and her bloodline clearly had German ancestry. At the time of his birth, his father was a mathematics teacher at Somme High School, and later successively transferred to Strasbourg, Clermont, and Clermont-Ferrand, where he served as a professor at the Faculty of Science. Bourget's education began in Clermont-Ferrand. Later, his father became the principal of Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris, and he also transferred to this high school to study. From the age of five or six, he began to read the works of Shakespeare and Scott, and at the age of fifteen he read two volumes of poetry by Alfred de Musset, and all of Balzac's novels, as well as part of Stendhal's novels. He graduated from high school in 1872 and entered the University of Paris to study Greek philology. After leaving university, he worked as a private tutor, and began his literary life at that time. In 1894, he succeeded Maxima du Camp as the president of the Académie Française, until his death in Paris on December 25, 1935, at the age of eighty-three.

Bourget, like most men of letters, began his literary life with poetry. His earliest works were collections of philosophical poetry with strong classical colors (Poesie philosophique), including: By the Sea (Au bord de la mer 1875), Restless Life (La vie inquiete 1875), Edel (Edel 1878) and Confessions (Les aveux 1882). These collections of poems were influenced by Musset, Sully Prudhomme, Baudelaire, and the contemporary (around 1875) French perception of English Lake Poets. In terms of poetic value, these poems are not very high, their greater value lies in psychology. In these collections of poems, Bourget tried his best to combine his admiration for Byron and Barbey d’Aurevilly, and his personal interest in applying delicate analysis to modern life. The titles of the first two collections of poems, By the Sea and Restless Life, clearly express this duality, showing his desire to discover a deep psychological foundation beneath the most adorned upper class society. Because the power of the mind and the passion for knowledge dominated his heart, poetry was not very suitable for him. He was a disciple of Taine and Fustel de Coulanges; in addition to enjoying Stendhal's psychological novels, he gradually focused on psychological analysis, publishing some critical research articles between 1883 and 1886. His essays, Contemporary Psychological Essays (Essais de psycholog·contemporaine 1883) and New Essays (Nouveaux Essais 1885), were an excellent harvest in the critical world at that time. He selected more than a dozen modern French writers, such as Baudelaire, Renan, Flaubert, Stendhal, Taine, Dumas fils, Leconte de Lisle, the Goncourt brothers, etc., to study the trends of modern people's psychology, and the state of the feelings of a generation; the method was rigorous, the content was accurate, and it could accurately point out the direction of the spiritual world at the end of the nineteenth century. This book has new evaluations and unique insights, so Bourget became known as a critic, but his true talent was not revealed by this. While continuing to write critical essays such as Studies and Portraits (Etudes et portraits 1888), he also moved the same research into novels and dramas, thus producing Cruel Enigma (Cruelle Enigme 1885), A Crime of Love (Un crim d'amour 1886), Lies (Mensonges 1888), etc. In these works, he was only looking for his personal expression. The spirit of psychological analysis that he could not fully express in his poems and essays began to develop greatly in novels. In these novels, the talents of psychologists and poets are expressed simultaneously.

### Idealism and Realism: Where is Chinese Painting Heading?

— Shi Liangfu

Painting is a visual art. Its initial creation stems from the inspiration people gain from the beauty of objects, using artistic techniques to express it as a personal form of entertainment. There is no so-called theoretical philosophical basis. This is especially true for Chinese painting, which has been budding, growing, flourishing, and continuing to exist. Although it also has many schools like Western painting, it does not categorize and set its creative standards entirely based on its starting points, like Western painting. Instead, it is distinguished based on the similarity of its expressions.

As Chinese painting has developed to this day, the situation seems to be somewhat different. Due to the influence of war on this generation of young painters—on the battlefield, in occupied areas, and in the rear—some paintings reflecting the tragic and heroic realities have emerged. As a result, some people are advocating realism, treating it in the same way as Western painting. They believe that Chinese painting should also emphasize the depiction of real life, like Japanese Ukiyo-e. At the same time, within this wave of discussion, some are also shouting: "Art is the embodiment of the spirit, especially Chinese painting, which takes 'Qi Yun Sheng Dong' (spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality) as its highest pursuit. Its style, strength, bone structure, form, and vitality are all expressions of romanticism. Therefore, Chinese painting should be based on idealism as its theoretical foundation." As a result, contemporary Chinese painting has inevitably been drawn into the vortex of the two major theories of realism and idealism.

So, who is the fundamental for Chinese painting theory: realism or idealism? Here, from a third-party perspective, let's make a brief analysis of the two viewpoints:

Advocates of realism believe that human spiritual abilities and cognitive abilities develop historically, and that various spiritual abilities take objective reality as their object. Especially painting, which is a visual art, creates a type, summarizing the essential and characteristic elements of a certain objective reality, and then synthesizing and concretizing it to form a type that can represent that kind of reality. It lies in expressing the typical character within the typical situation. Furthermore, because art is objective, and this objectivity determines subjectivity, artists only need to faithfully imitate nature, and appreciators can naturally grasp the nature being imitated and have the same interest as the creator. The root of this interest lies in the nature of reality itself. That is to say, the reason art is art lies in imitating the "truth" of nature. Therefore, visual art starts with realism as its theoretical basis.

Conversely, advocates of idealism believe that the task of art is not purely to reflect reality, but to create beauty through the self's spirit. Since it is the creation of beauty, it is a product of the spirit. Products of the spirit are neither produced by nature nor are they objective things. Therefore, there is no so-called objectivity in art. Appreciators can have the same interest as the creator due to the resonance of beautiful emotions. It is the spirit moving the spirit. In other words, the reason art is art lies in the beautiful emotions and aesthetic experience. This kind of beautiful emotion produces different expressive techniques. These different techniques are the different inspirations of the painters. Because of the differences in inspiration, painters cannot faithfully depict things in the same way like cameras. Therefore, this kind of beautiful inspiration and aesthetic experience are the starting points of painting.

In summary, we know that the conclusions of the two are: "Do not impose preconceived notions on reality, depict reality as it is, and such a creative attitude is realism." "Impose preconceived notions on reality, and then judge or abandon reality, and such a creative attitude is called idealism."

So, to which school does the tradition and current situation of Chinese painting belong? What is its theoretical starting point? We believe that although our ancestors in the art world have never mentioned the eight characters of idealism and realism in their art theories, we can easily find some theoretical basis in the Six Principles and in fragmented art theories. The Six Principles of Xie He of the Southern Qi Dynasty are the eternal constitution of Chinese painting. From copying and transferring, arranging positions, depicting colors according to types, depicting forms according to objects, using the brush with bone method, to achieving spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality, the arrangement of these six principles is equivalent to the ranking of the work's value. Spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality is praised as the ultimate in Chinese painting. The expression of this kind of spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality can be said to be the expression of subjective art. Just as Zhang Yanyuan commented on Wu Daozi, he said: "Guarding his spirit, focusing on the one, combining the skill of creation, borrowing Wu Sheng's brush, the so-called intention precedes the brush, the painting exhausts the intention. Using ink brush and ruler is dead brushwork. Guarding his spirit and focusing on the one is truthfulness. What is the point of a wall full of dead paintings? A single stroke of a true brush shows its vitality. When one thinks and wields the brush, if one thinks of it as painting, then one becomes obsessed with painting. If the intention is not on the painting, then one achieves it. It does not stagnate in the hand, does not congeal in the heart, and is naturally so. Even when bending a bow, extending a blade, erecting pillars, or constructing beams, how can ink brush and ruler be involved?" This means that painting should not only be confined to traces, but also should not be confused by brushstrokes. Furthermore, Dong Yougou said, "Hills and valleys are formed in the mind, and when one understands, one expresses them in painting. Therefore, objects leave traces, and scenes arise with vision, almost in harmony with heaven." These two statements advocate first gaining from reality and then abandoning it, and then expressing freely, so that the spirit, essence, and interest will naturally flow out. In addition, Su Dongpo said, "To discuss painting in terms of formal likeness is to be neighbors with children." Ni Yunlin said, "What I call painting is just a casual stroke, not seeking formal likeness, just to amuse myself." Yan Yuan also said, "If one gets the formal likeness, then one loses the spiritual consonance; if one has all the colors, then one loses the brushwork." Du Gongbu criticized and satirized Han Gan's lifelike paintings of "horses"! He wrote a poem: "The disciple Han Gan entered the studio early and could also paint horses in all their special features. Han only paints flesh but not bones, how can he bear to let the Hua Liu (a famous horse) lose its spirit?" From the tone of these representative writers, one can get a glimpse of the theory of Chinese painting—mostly emphasizing spiritual likeness over formal likeness.

However, does the emphasis on spiritual likeness in Chinese painting completely obliterate reality like the Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists? Not at all! Let's take the "Six Principles" as an example: in the Six Principles, spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality, and using the brush with bone method are subjective and spiritual, while depicting forms according to objects and depicting colors according to types are objective and realistic. Arranging positions is subjective and spiritual, while copying and transferring are objective and realistic. Secondly, Dai Wenjie said, "Painting must have seven conditions: one, refined emotions; two, harmony between brush and hand; three, pure colors and ink; four, new travels in mountains and waters (or new seeing of famous works); five, the person requesting the painting is a good connoisseur; six, inspiration; seven, skill should be in the state of neither unfamiliar nor overly familiar. Only when the seven conditions are met can a good composition be created." Furthermore, the six strengths, six essentials, eight styles, three faults, and twelve avoidances in painting methods all serve as warnings to painters that they should pay attention to the interrelationship of creation in the heavens and on earth, and that a certain period and a certain region cannot be confused (such as no willows on high mountains, no pine trees on beaches, etc.). From these perspectives, although Chinese painting is somewhat biased towards subjective idealism, it does not completely obliterate reality, but rather attaches considerable importance to reality. Mr. Jiang Xizeng said, "According to the principle of painting, it is nothing more than the harmony of spirit and form. The two cannot be neglected. If there is form without spirit, then the form is a dead thing. If there is spirit without form, then the spirit has nothing to rely on, that is, there is no way to express it. The Chinese painting theory of spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality can be said to coincide with this. The so-called 'learn from creation externally, and obtain from the mind internally' is also." This also illustrates the inseparability of the subjective and the objective, and that matter and spirit complement each other and are mutually causal. Therefore, the creation of a genius artist not only does not violate the typicality of objective reality through subjective action, but also strengthens the typicality of objective reality. This is something that realists cannot deny.

The above is our citation and analysis of the two. Here, I will further discuss my opinion on this issue: The production of Chinese painting differs from that of Europe due to our "nationality," "locality," "production tools," "creative methods," and the connection between Chinese culture (especially poetry, calligraphy, etc.) and philosophical thought with painting, which differs from that of Western countries. Therefore, Chinese painting and Western painting cannot be mentioned in the same breath or spoken of on the same day. Let's comment on the works of writers who currently advocate becoming closer to realism: Yesterday, the YMCA in the city of Baxianqiao held an exhibition of Situ Qiao's disaster paintings. Except for three or four pieces of misty rivers and mountains, all the works depict the tragic living conditions of the victims in the disaster area. It can be said that they completely reflect objective reality, exposing the ugly reality and the cruel reality, and express extreme dissatisfaction with reality. In terms of its effect, it is undeniable that it has a sharp stimulating effect. All viewers who enter the exhibition feel pity and sadness. However, in terms of the intrinsic value of art itself, it cannot be regarded as a great and successful work, because the ugliness of its content covers up the beauty of its technique, causing people to feel disgust with reality, and it cannot evoke an incomparably comfortable sense of "beauty." If this is the case, then what is the purpose of artistic creation? If it is said to be used as a political tool or a means of arousing emotions, wouldn't the scenes taken by a camera be more real and more moving? Although its content and tone, composition, decoration, and style are all traditional national forms, viewers can only regard it as a quick sketch or caricature of Western painting, and cannot regard it as a representative work of the New Chinese Painting Movement.

Not long ago, Mr. Cai Yuanpei advocated "replacing religion with aesthetic education," believing that religion still cannot break away from the words "profit and harm" in action, and only art can beautify life and moral life. If all mankind replaced religion with aesthetic education, the world would be unified. Therefore, I believe that art should not be used as a political tool or a means of arousing emotions, but should use its beauty to comfort life and beautify life.

The Chinese nation is a peace-loving and indifferent nation, rich in the habit of containing and assimilating. Especially in painting, it can best express its latent and rich national spirit, a kind of plain and innocent sentiment, which makes people feel relaxed, calm, and detached from the world at first glance. Therefore, reacting to objective reality and exposing the ugly straight state of life are not what Chinese painting seeks. From these perspectives, we can say that the revival movement of Chinese painting cannot take realism as its theoretical starting point, and absolute idealism cannot grasp this revival movement either. The true theoretical basis is still the harmony of the subjective and the objective, not absolutely belonging to either side.

### School Scarcity

— Shao Fu

Yesterday, this newspaper published a news feature on page four entitled "Difficulty in Taking Entrance Exams." The education authorities are not unaware of this situation, and perhaps know it even more deeply than we do. However, knowing is one thing, and actively seeking solutions is another. Therefore, I am willing to tirelessly make an urgent appeal to the authorities on behalf of these out-of-school youths who are wandering and hesitating without access to schools.

Several of the better schools (including those with good curriculum, good management, or good facilities) are either not enrolling or have extremely limited enrollment quotas. During this period, the parents of many students are truly distraught over this issue, seeking favors and pleading everywhere. I have written several letters and made several phone calls for friends.

At first, when friends asked me to do this, I politely declined. I said, "If your son's grades are good, he will naturally have the ability to pass the exam. I cannot help you by speaking on behalf of someone who is cheating, and even if speaking on behalf of someone is effective, it is not a good thing for your son, because it plants a thought of taking private gain as public in his pure mind. Human relations and relationships have manipulated society, and our generation has already suffered from it. How can we allow it to continue to spread?" My friend agreed with my theory, but he said, "I know that using this method is unreasonable and harmful to my own children, but I can't help it. Please ask, if there are two or three thousand applicants and only two or three hundred are admitted, often less than one-tenth, my child is not the most outstanding, but I am confident that he is above average, but if he encounters the same exam scores, it is very likely that he will fail without asking for favors because of the quota. " I could not deny the reason for my friend's reply, so I could not help but write a letter of request for my friend. This phenomenon is too sad. It seems that only the phrase "drinking poison to quench thirst" can be compared.

There are so many seekers of education and so few schools, and the lives of teachers are so poor that they cannot eat their fill and keep warm, and the mission of education is shouldering such a heavy responsibility to build the country. Who is to blame for a series of contradictions and the most tragic and ridiculous situation?

In a nutshell, there is too little education funding.

### Fortune Telling and Face Reading

— Tong Fang

There are many fortune tellers and physiognomists in our country who add the beautiful title of "philosopher" to their names, as if it is not enough to show their skills without calling themselves "philosophical fortune telling." To say that "fortune tellers" (whether this term can be established is of course still a question) are "philosophers" is really a "gimmick" as Shanghai people say. May I ask, which of the great philosophers of ancient and modern times could predict fate or read faces? If Socrates, Kant, Hegel, and Engels knew how to predict fate, they would be as busy as Yuan Shushan, a true genius in Shanghai, and would have no time to think and write?

In fact, the art of fortune telling and physiognomy is not as mysterious as most people imagine, nor is it so full of philosophical flavor. (Of course, modern philosophy has been incorporated into the field of science.) Modern European and American psychologists have found psychological basis for the principles of fortune telling and physiognomy, especially in the research of physiognomy, which makes more use of scientific methods. The German science of handwriting analysis, the American science of facial morphology, and the French science of emotional response have already raised the banner of revolution for traditional physiognomy, and the future development is unlimited.

In the past, Chinese fortune-telling techniques could at most be said to be based on historical experience, and there were many far-fetched places that were not convincing. The emerging physiognomy that is researched based on psychological principles is completely different. The history of their development is still short, and it is certainly not possible to say that they have completely approached scientific methods, but the future trend will certainly enable physiognomy to occupy an important position in the scientific field.

German psychologist Dr. Lansing wrote a thick "Science of Handwriting Analysis" based on his more than 20 years of teaching experience. In 1940, Lansing determined from the handwriting of Hitler and Goebbels that they would surely die in the war. There was also a famous female star, Natalie Lehman, who published her signature style in the newspaper, and Lansing determined that this star would surely divorce once and be abandoned again, which was later proven. The research of handwriting analysis has recently spread from Germany and France to the United States, and many scholars have emerged. In recent years, scientific physiognomy has made great progress in the United Kingdom, and experts have published specialized reports on their research. This includes palm reading, toe reading, face reading, hair and skin reading, belt reading, etc. American psychologists have gathered together, and their research in this area is also booming. Now, let's just talk about the research of face reading.

American psychologist Hollingworth deduces various different personalities from the emotional responses of a group of people to determine their future and see what kind of work their abilities are best suited to do in order to achieve success. This is the first step in the research of scientific physiognomy. In fact, studying the different emotional responses of each person to measure their personality does not contain the meaning of determining whether fate is good or bad. Professor Bolling uses seven different tests to measure the correlation between facial morphology and emotions, temperament, success expectations, perseverance, thought, and physique, gradually approaching the questions that face reading needs to answer. According to the research of most psychologists, this kind of test is considered very reliable. He and his students have been hired by several industrial organizations and large stores in New York. When recruiting new employees, they are asked to express their opinions after observing various different facial morphologies as a reference for recruitment. Bolling also compiled a special book based on his ten years of observation and investigation experience and the records of thousands of subjects, called "Facial Morphology and Luck," pointing out the facial morphologies of some lucky people, some mediocre people, and some unlucky people. His disciple, Feller, continued to conduct scientific research on the relationship between body shape and personality, preferences, and destiny, and made many valuable discoveries. The institute of physiognomy he founded has received a lot of support from psychologists. Students from the University of Wisconsin, the University of Michigan, Cornell University, and the University of California have joined the research there. Professor Fulnell of Yale University has recently focused on the study of handprints, but his research is different from the handprint science studied by criminologists. He wants to discover the correlation between various different handprints and people's emotions, personalities, preferences, and other factors. According to him, the thickness of the handprints is quite related to a person's fate, and the thickness and hardness of the palm can be used as an important factor in measuring whether a person's future is happy or not.

Professor Compong, who was originally a professor of anthropology at Harvard University, has been extremely interested in the "psychological type" divided by the Institute of Psychology for several years. His thesis "Type and Intelligence" has long attracted general attention. Now, he is committed to scientific physiognomy, which is changing with each passing day, and wants to discover its connection with happiness from the "psychological type" and create a "type physiognomy" separately. He also wants to study the "blood type" valued by physicians, because if the fate of a person can be measured from the type, and then the analysis of the "blood type" can be added, perhaps more accurate results can be obtained.

Psychologists use various tests to understand a person's emotions, personality, interests, intelligence, etc., which is also of great help to scientific physiognomy. However, according to Guan Xin and another psychologist, the method of testing is still direct and can be used for psychological research, but it seems to take more steps to intuitively measure a person's appearance and be able to understand him and predict his future. Therefore, the scientific face reading technique that is researched and established based on psychology can only use the results of the test as a reference, but does not need to go through the testing procedure again.

Someone asked Feller: If physiognomy is truly established on science, then a person's future can be determined by his facial morphology, which seems to place too much emphasis on the idea of ​​"determinism." Can the changes in the environment and human efforts not transfer a person's fate?

Feller's answer is very correct. He said: "Fate is not absolute, but relative. What scientific physiognomy wants to study is the 'general trend,' just as psychologists study people's emotions and personality. It can let us know what a person's general psychological state is like, but it does not affirm that it is permanently fixed and will continue like this forever. At the same time, based on the psychological principles of physiognomy, it can make people more deeply recognize the meaning of 'individual differences' and 'special intelligence,' so that everyone can move in the direction where academic career may develop the most."

In short, the emerging scientific physiognomy established based on psychological principles is a fresh and cutting-edge discipline. We hope that more of this knowledge can be introduced to China. In today's complex society, in addition to adhering to what the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said, "You must know yourself," we should also understand others with an appropriate attitude. This is quite related to the adaptation of life between individuals.

### Unable to Resist a Smile

— Tian Yi

Hungary's currency is inflated and banknotes are worthless. Therefore, the Hungarian government issued a new currency called the Florint, with each new currency being worth 40 million old pengos. In fact, I think it would be better if the Hungarian government did not issue a new currency.

Now, let me tell you the advantage below:

If a businessman goes to Hungary, he will definitely talk about this when talking to them:

"Brother, how much money do you have in the bank?"

"Not much, only 100 million yuan"

"What? How much?"

"100 million yuan."

"Ah! Congratulations, congratulations, so may I ask how much do you make every day?"

At this time, the businessman wanted to smoke, so the Hungarian hurriedly took out a 1 million yuan banknote to light it, so the businessman hurriedly said:

"Brother, that's a 1 million yuan bill!"

"It's nothing, it's nothing!"

### For the Sake of Life

— Youfu

There's a photo studio on Tibet Road that I often visit for photos. Each time I go, I always see a boy around ten years old working very busily. I couldn't help but develop an interest in him, hoping to have a conversation and learn about his background, but I never had a good opportunity, which I always regretted.

This afternoon, I went there again. As soon as I arrived at the photo studio, I saw the boy again. I directly said to him, "I need my photos for application, please urge them! Are they ready?" He smiled and said, "Let me go take a look!" In a moment, he ran back and said to me, "The photos will be ready soon, please wait a moment." In less than five minutes, he brought the photos. I thanked him very much for being so efficient.

As these impressions were still swirling in my mind, I remembered my original thought. So I looked around, and besides a female employee, there was no one else. I thought this was a golden opportunity and immediately started chatting with him.

I saw him sitting on the sofa, reading a yellow magazine. I asked him, "Can you read?" He replied, "I don't know many characters." Then, I asked him a series of questions about his background, and he answered them one by one. After hearing his story, I felt very sad. It was as if he wasn't speaking, but groaning. Yes, he was groaning about the lament of a photo studio apprentice.

He is only sixteen years old and from Pudong. Before the war, his family had a good environment. After the war, his father died and no one could continue the business, so the store had to close. His mother is old and relies on his father's savings to survive. For eight years, they have been barely eking out a living. In 1943, he graduated from elementary school but couldn't continue his education due to economic constraints. After the victory, prices slightly dropped, then greatly rose, making it difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, he had to reluctantly leave his elderly mother and become an apprentice at the photo studio. For three meals a day, he works all day long. Regardless of strong winds, heavy snow, or scorching sun, he must obey his boss's orders and work. Every day from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM, he has no rest during this time. Speaking of his salary, it's truly laughable. Besides providing food, he only receives 5,000 yuan. He started with 5,000 yuan and still gets 5,000 yuan now. I really don't understand how they survive.

He also told me that he loves to look at paintings and read books, but he has absolutely no free time to do so. Finally, he said very pessimistically, "I am an uneducated person, so I can only be a beast of burden for the rest of my life. That's just my fate! "For the sake of life, what can one say?

This is a social problem. Nowadays, tens of thousands of children and young people are forced to drop out of school and live miserable lives because of the pressures of survival. I believe there are many people who are even more miserable than this apprentice!

### Don't Just Use Your Mouth, Use Your Eyes More Often

— Lingren

Many years ago, in a theater in Chicago, USA, there was a speaker. During his speech, only the stage lights were on, and the lights in the audience were all off. At first, he heard a lot of noise from the audience, but after a while, the noise decreased. He thought his speech was having a good effect, so he spoke more energetically and with more animation. Half an hour passed, and the noise gradually decreased. An hour passed, and there was almost no sound from the audience. After an hour and a half, he finished his speech and the lights were turned on. Only then did he realize that the audience had all slipped away. However, miraculously, he saw one person remaining in the front row. He was surprised and asked the person why he didn't leave with the others. The person replied, "Because after you finish speaking, it's my turn."

### How Ruthless! Eating the Blood of Dancers and Profiteering from the Refugees

— Chongzheng

The urgent problem that needs to be solved is rescuing the three million refugees from Northern Jiangsu. Now, various regions are responding to this great charitable relief movement. Even the dancers who lead a life of embracing for survival are generously holding charity dances for disaster relief.

However, some people have come up with extremely despicable ideas and used extremely ruthless means in such a solemn act of charity, eating the blood of dancers and profiteering from the refugees. Their behavior is hateful, and their hearts are deserving of punishment.

According to reports, a dancer named Li Zhenzhen in a certain dance hall had a customer buy her dance tickets for one million yuan, but the dance hall manager deducted 700,000 yuan from it. I feel that 700,000 yuan is a small matter, but with the lives of three million people at stake, this gentleman is too ruthless.

In fact, the dancers themselves are forced to smile for a living. Their income is the crystallization of their bodies and souls, and they are also exploited by the big bosses. They themselves are already miserable enough. But today, they resolutely give up a day's earnings to participate in the charity dance, donating the money earned from forcing smiles to the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. Unexpectedly, this manager deducted 700,000 yuan from the one million yuan earned by a dancer. After taking advantage of this opportunity, I wonder how he can sleep peacefully at night?

### An Old Man's Heart (Part 2)

— Wang Pingling

Why have the Chinese people fallen into such a state? I can only find such an unsatisfactory answer, which is "the trend of the times, nothing can be done about it." Today, the three million refugees in Northern Jiangsu refuse to participate in the "struggle" under the call of Zhu and Mao, which is to go against the trend, to be counter-revolutionary, to be non-revolutionary. Their displacement and death in ditches, the countless innocent children who are starving and dying of disease, in the eyes of those progressive elements who have climbed to the forefront of the times, who are standing at the forefront, and washing away the "revolution," are they worthy of death? Therefore, Mr. Yuan's hunger strike telegram, Mr. Huang Yanpei's "conscience words," and Dr. Hu Shi's sympathy for the refugees in Northern Jiangsu will not receive good criticism from a group of progressive elements and revolutionaries. I predict that Mr. Yanpei will inevitably be criticized by his allies in his noble alliance! As for the heads of Mr. Yuan and Dr. Hu, including this small district, I dare to say that they have already made several hats for them, such as "corrupt, stubborn, declining, unprogressive, used by the government, unversed in the times..." etc., etc.

The Chinese people also have a special characteristic, which is that they only seek to satisfy their own desires, and they never care about the lives and deaths of others. At this moment, in the "barren land" of culture, such cruel facts are still prevalent, that is, when a boat capsizes and sinks, and countless drowning people are calling for help, those lucky ones who row many wooden boats and come downstream, only care about robbing things, and usually ignore them. If there are refugees who can swim and desperately climb onto their rudders, these lucky ones will still desperately beat them into the water. According to those lucky ones, "The drowning of these people is because the drowning ghosts are asking for replacements, it's all destined, they should die. If you save their lives, the drowning ghosts will replace them." Such a cruel mentality cannot be sympathized with by civilization; but cultured people also often commit the same cruel mentality, turning a blind eye to the imminent death of the three million refugees in Northern Jiangsu, ignoring them. To this day, we only hear a few words of conscience from Mr. Huang Yanpei, Dr. Hu's light sigh, and Mr. Yuan's hunger strike telegram, which is just one example.

Mr. Yuan! You are already seventy-one years old this year! In such a terrible country as China, to live to your old age is truly a "human treasure" worth celebrating! Alas! Respectable "old man's heart!"

This small district has always been independent, discerning right and wrong, and seeking justice. Knowing that in this era, it is not the way to "protect oneself wisely," I cannot help but often feel reminiscent of Emperor Xian of Han's words: "I also don't know when my life will end!"

A Collection of Brief Comments

### The Full Rong Case Detective Secrets Revealed

— Wulingren

It is reported that there was malpractice in the dance hall, and a dance hall girl named Li Zhenzhen had one million yuan in dance tickets, which was deducted by the dance hall manager for 700,000. Therefore, the Dance Hall Industry Association stated that it would thoroughly investigate. Of course, the general public is very resentful of this manager's "ruthlessness." Jin believes that the dance hall authorities are also too negligent. Why didn't they ask her to hold a grand "swearing-in" ceremony at the beginning of her employment?

The Garrison Headquarters has publicly released the entire process of solving the kidnapping case of Rong Desheng. The report is tens of thousands of words long, and many newspapers are sparing no effort to publish it, even at the expense of valuable space. This was not an easy task to accomplish in the concession era before the war. It seems that even cases more valuable than Rong Desheng's kidnapping have never had such a public and detailed report after the entire case was concluded. Was it that the foreigners deliberately buried the merits of the many Chinese officers who contributed, or did they look down on the press? Or did they think that it was inappropriate to publicly divulge the secrets of detective skills, so as not to increase the difficulty of solving the next case?

British Miss Samoskir wants to lick her fingers after eating chocolate, according to her, the only reason is that it is currently rare to taste this flavor. From the perspective of Shanghai ladies, they only feel that Miss Sa is too shabby and "poor." Isn't it true that Shanghai has plenty of foreign candies that can be bought along the way and are very cheap, so even the beggar Li Zhongsheng eats a tea-gray empty stomach?

The authorities are said to have raised the housing rent standard, calculated as 1,000 times the rent in 1937. At the same time, there is also the saying that rents will be allowed to increase. Residential houses will increase by 500 times the amount in 1937, and commercial houses will increase by 1,000 times. Many people who already have residences are clamoring that they "can't afford it," but there are also many people who think they "can afford it" but have no place to live.
