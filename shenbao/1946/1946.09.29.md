### The Prospect of Peace Talks Gradually Becomes Clear; It is Heard that Chairman Chiang Has Accepted Marshall's Suggestion; The Two Subcommittee Meetings May Be Held Simultaneously

[This newspaper, Nanjing, telephone call at 3:00 AM this morning] Chairman Chiang has always adhered to peaceful and democratic methods in resolving national affairs, and will continue to follow this approach in the future in order to achieve peace. It is heard that the Chairman has accepted the suggestions of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, to hold the three-person military meeting and the five-person political meeting concurrently. Since the Chairman's return to Nanjing, Marshall and Stuart have successively paid visits on the 7th and conducted in-depth discussions separately. After further consultations between Marshall and Stuart on the 8th, a decision was made that the meetings could be held as early as the 9th, provided that the CCP side has no objections.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] By the afternoon of the 8th, the peace talks gradually showed signs of progress. Although Zhou Enlai was still in Shanghai and had not returned, his reply to Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart had arrived in Nanjing. The relevant parties kept its contents secret. At 5:10 PM, CCP representative Dong Biwu, accompanied by Wang Bingnan, went to the US Embassy, personally handed Zhou's reply to Ambassador Stuart, and discussed the ceasefire issue. He left at 6:10 PM. This reporter happened to be at the embassy and immediately approached to inquire about Zhou Enlai's return date. Dong told him that Zhou had sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart, avoiding answering the question of Zhou's return date. Five minutes later, the Ambassador went out. Both the Ambassador and Dong Biwu seemed pleased, as if a clear path had been found. At 6:30 PM, Wang Bingnan returned alone to see Special Envoy Marshall to explain the matter.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] Ambassador Stuart had a deep discussion with his personal advisor, Pu Jingbo, last night regarding the progress of the peace talks. He visited Special Envoy Marshall at 9:30 AM on the 8th, talking for about an hour. After returning to the embassy, he received Pi Zonggan, a military aide of the National Government, and Shen Changhuan, a secretary of the National Government.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] Relevant personnel involved in the peace talks had frequent contact on the 8th. At 11:00 AM, Shen Changhuan, a secretary of the National Government, was ordered to go to the US Embassy to meet with Ambassador Stuart and his personal advisor, Fu Jingbo.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] According to information from the CCP delegation, Dong Biwu is the representative authorized to contact the US side and the government on behalf of the CCP during Zhou Enlai's absence from Nanjing. Zhou has been away from Nanjing for several days, and it is the first time that Dong has appeared as a representative today. Therefore, many believe that Dong Biwu may take Zhou Enlai's position and replace him. However, the spokesperson for the CCP delegation stated tonight that Zhou Enlai has not withdrawn from the negotiations. Regarding the current form of peace talks, the spokesperson stated that the three-person military meeting is a legitimate and suitable mechanism for discussing military issues. Therefore, the CCP has proposed convening the three-person meeting. However, if the government believes that there are other appropriate mechanisms to discuss military matters, the CCP can consider it. But so far, the CCP has not received such opinions. According to reliable sources, the situation may change, but the mediators deeply hope that Zhou Enlai will return to Nanjing as soon as possible, as Zhou is a representative of both the three-person meeting and the five-person meeting, and he is skilled at convening meetings and handling issues.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] Conner, a news officer at the US Embassy, said on the 8th: Ambassador Stuart visited Special Envoy Marshall on the 8th and had discussions, but the content is unknown. Regarding rumors that Marshall and Stuart have made new suggestions to Chairman Chiang, he knew nothing about it. When asked by reporters whether the CCP has replied to the joint letter from Marshall and Stuart, Conner said: He knew for sure that Marshall and Stuart had sent a joint letter to Zhou Enlai, but he did not know its contents and whether the CCP had replied. When asked by reporters whether there were new signs of optimism about the future of negotiations, now that Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing and Zhou Enlai is expected to return soon, Conner smiled but did not answer, and did not criticize the claim by some parties that the situation was serious.

### The Battle for Zhangyuan is About to Begin; The National Army Entering Chahar from Eastern Sui is Progressing Rapidly; Closing in on the Important Communist Army Stronghold of Nanhouchang

[This newspaper, Beiping, 8th dispatch] According to relevant sources, the National Army entering Chahar from Eastern Sui is progressing rapidly on multiple routes. The troops that recovered Shangdu Shangyi have approached the important Communist Army stronghold of Nanhouchang and a fierce battle may take place there with the Communist Army. Nanhouchang is 150 li away from Zhangjiakou. After the National Army recovers the area, it can divide into two routes, one heading towards Zhangyuan and the other crossing the mountains towards Chaigoubao, joining forces with the National Army on the northern route to approach Zhangjiakou.

[This newspaper, Guihua, 7th dispatch] According to reliable sources, Shangyi has been recovered by the Twelfth War Zone, and the great battle to attack Zhangyuan is about to begin. The Communist Army in the countryside of Liangcheng and Helin counties in Eastern Sui has gradually been cleared, and the two sides are currently facing each other at Shahu Pass. There are still a few local Communist forces in the mountains within Liangcheng, which can be eliminated soon. The western section of the Ping-Sui Railway from Datong to Baotou will be open to traffic in one or two days. Currently, only a bridge a few miles east of Fengzhen has not been repaired. The construction of this bridge is not very large and is expected to be completed on the evening of the 7th or the morning of the 8th. With the completion of this bridge, the entire western section of the Ping-Sui Railway will be open to traffic.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 8th dispatch] The war in Zhangjiakou is about to begin, but important news will definitely be available in three to five days. Confident generals claim that Zhangjiakou can be taken within a week, as it is estimated that the Communist Army can only mobilize two brigades of Xiao Ke, one division and six brigades of Nie Rongzhen. The National Army can deploy three armies on the eastern front of the Ping-Sui Railway alone, making it easy to recover Zhangjiakou in one fell swoop. The work of the Chahar Provincial Government, which has been displaced in Beiping, to return to the province has reached an intense stage. Near Shunyi in eastern Hebei, the Communist Army has been dispersed, but large groups of Communist Army with three to four thousand people have been discovered in Jianchangying and Fengrun north of Lulong. The authorities are sending troops to clear them. Although the Communist Army in eastern Hebei has withdrawn from the cities, they still appear erratically, so the entire military constraint is extremely large. The North China troops are currently adjusting their positions. The 94th Army, which was originally garrisoning the Beining area, will move west to Beiping, and the defense tasks left behind will be taken over by a certain elite army from the Xin-Zun-Hai area. The 92nd Army, which was originally stationed in Beiping, has new tasks.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 8th dispatch] It is reported that the National Army in Northern Rehe has crossed the Weichang and its northern mountain areas and reached the grassland area.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th dispatch] According to military news, the Communist Army recently transferred six brigades from Yan'an to the east, and the vanguard troops have arrived near Kechengzhen, which belongs to Puxian County.

### Li Zongren's Talk

[This newspaper, Beiping, 8th dispatch] Director Li said at a reception for reporters tonight that the situation in Chahar Province will soon become clear. When reporters asked about the timing, Li replied that it would be in the near future. Chief of Staff Wang also denied that the actions of the National Army in eastern Chahar had crossed Kangzhuang. He also denied the claim that the National Army in Northern Rehe had crossed Weichang. Commander Sun said that the National Army completely controls 65 counties in Hebei Province, and the Communist Army still controls 14 county towns.

### Communist Army in Lianshui Fights Like Cornered Beasts; The National Army on the Hai-Tai Line Has Recovered Huangqiao; Communist Army Generals Hold a Meeting in Yancheng

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 8th dispatch] Fierce battles are taking place within Lianshui, with intertwined positions and intense fighting. The Communist Army is trying to fight like cornered beasts to cover its troops in the Funing area as they retreat towards Southern Shandong. The National Army is blocking them. The war in that area is expected to be resolved within a week.

[This newspaper, Taixian, 28th dispatch] On the Taixing front, the National Army, in order to clear the remaining Communist forces north of the Hai-Tai Line, recovered Huangqiao the day before yesterday. The Communist Army retreated along both sides of the Ru-Huang Highway, and the National Army swept them away in separate directions. Transportation between Ru and Huang will not be difficult to restore. The Communist Army between Gaoyou and Lianshui used the means of breaching dikes to hinder the National Army's advance, but the National Army has already cut off the communication between the two places. The Communist Army entrenched in the two places is clearly isolated.

[This newspaper, Taixian, 27th dispatch] Senior Communist Army generals Xu Xiangqian, Su Yu, Guan Wenyue, Liu Jiping, and others held a military conference in Yancheng on the 22nd of this month to discuss future strategies. It was decided that if positional warfare fails again, they would abandon urban strongholds and implement rural guerrilla warfare, and act in accordance with the predetermined strategy of "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy is tired, we advance." In addition, they decided to step up all riot and massacre activities.

[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 28th dispatch] The Communist Army in Shaobo transferred three regiments from Yancheng and Funing on the 6th and actively increased defensive works in an attempt to make a final stand.

### The Corruption and Degeneration of the Communist Army is Exposed by He Long

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th dispatch] The CCP Jin-Sui Border Region held a "Cadre Mobilization Conference" in Xingxian County on September 6th. It is reported that Communist Army Commander He Long's speech exposed the Communist Army cadres' corruption and degeneration, wavering will, and anti-internal strife sentiments. The general idea was: So many people don't even read the newspaper. What they can hear and see is playing the erhu, playing poker, building opera stages, and building houses. It's a scene of peace. If we want to continue fighting, we must start up our machine. Although the machine is very good, it is very rusty. The most serious phenomenon at present is corruption and waste. The Adjutant's Office of the Headquarters opened a shop. The people in the shop hooked up with a few prostitutes. They wear silk clothes, while some old people still wear fur coats in the summer. More than 50 old people in Caijiaya gave 120 dan of public grain. The burden on the old people is extremely heavy, but we don't know how to cherish it. The grain bureau ruined 900 dan at once. Corruption has become a trend in the financial and commercial departments and agencies. One corruption is hundreds of thousands or millions. Just talking about the things that the chief of the Materials Section of the Health Department embezzled is enough for his wife, children, nanny, and other seven people to squander for five years. The special commissioner's office specially built a theater in Xingxian County for watching operas, which cost 300 dan of millet. In order to make themselves spacious and convenient, they occupied more cave dwellings of the old people, so that the old people had no place to live, and three generations (grandfather, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter) rested together. Speaking of the production of agencies, they have occupied many of the old people's water fields. A few wells in Caijiaya have been occupied by the public. Speaking of the lives of ordinary cadres, everyone is idle and playing the erhu, playing poker, and playing mahjong. Are you all old masters? Some people still have wrong ideas about peace today. They want to make peace quickly and go to big cities. They ask people how the negotiations are going, thinking of Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, or even Zhangjiakou, considering themselves as a big talent and despising the Jin-Sui Border Region. These people have no conscience. We must plan for a long-term war, and we must resolutely continue to fight.

### Communist Army Generals Start Internal Strife; Demand Severe Punishment for Nie Rongzhen

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th dispatch] The Communist Army's failed siege of Datong this time, and the widespread military defeat in eastern Hebei, Rehe, and Chahar and Sui, has caused friction and differences of opinion among its internal major generals. Zhu De recently arrived in Zhangjiakou from Yan'an and convened his important generals for a symposium. Nie Rongzhen's siege of Datong this time,调出 the powerful troops in the Rehe territory, causing the loss of Chengde, was the biggest mistake. The generals unanimously demanded that responsibility be investigated and that Nie Rongzhen be severely punished.

### Clayton Meets with Reporters; Explains US Policy Towards China; Hopes That Our Country Can Resolve Political Disputes Satisfactorily

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th dispatch] US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton told reporters today that the United States still has the hope that China's internal political disputes can be resolved satisfactorily, and said: The United States is following a policy based on this hope and, circumstances permitting, with the greatest patience and consideration. Clayton made this statement in response to a reporter's question as to whether the State Department had received any news that would restore the general atmosphere of optimism, that is, news that a ceasefire could be achieved within China. Clayton replied: No. The reporter asked this question because the United Press Nanjing newsletter reported that Marshall had an hour-long meeting with President Chiang at the President's residence and that the government invited Zhou Enlai to return to Beijing to reopen the talks. The official atmosphere in Nanjing was quite optimistic.

[United Press, New York, 7th dispatch] A Wall Street journal published an editorial today entitled "Look at China," which stated that the important part of Stalin's statement was not that he was unwilling to fight for things that could be obtained by other methods, but rather that he implied what the Soviet Union must fight for. "He clearly stated that the presence of US troops in China is enough to threaten peace. From this, it can be inferred that the Soviet Union has not achieved its territorial goals in the East, but actually wants to achieve them. If the United States continues to maintain its position of interfering in China, disputes may arise as a result. We believe that the Washington administration and the American people should think deeply about this matter and plan a policy as soon as possible to avoid formulating policies under coercion."

### Members of the Wartime Assets Investigation Committee Question the Case of Selling Surplus Materials to China

[United Press, Washington, 27th dispatch] The Senate's Wartime Assets Investigation Conference held a meeting today. Members of the Investigation Committee questioned Connor, the senior official in charge of the liquidation of foreign assets, and his assistant Lane about the sale of 800 million yuan of surplus materials to China. Lane said that China will pay the United States 275 million US dollars, with 150 million US dollars used to offset China's debt to the United States, and 25 million US dollars used to cover the transportation costs of surplus materials from the Pacific to China.

[French News Agency, Washington, 27th dispatch] Senator Fulbright recently inquired Major General Connor about the issue of the disposal of all surplus materials in the United States, saying: The United States allows China to use US aircraft and Air Force personnel to train Chinese pilots. Is the purpose to defend the Western Hemisphere's military aid to China bill, which has not yet been approved by Congress? Does the US government intend to start implementing the military aid to China plan before Congress approves it? Major General Connor immediately replied that, as of now, the assistance provided by the United States to China is limited to the materials that are currently in China, because the National Government led by Chairman Chiang is the only Chinese government recognized by the United States.

### Elders of the Diplomatic and Legal Circles Discuss the Issue of US Military Withdrawal

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] A few people in Shanghai recently launched a so-called "Week of Responding to the US Military's Withdrawal from China Movement." For this matter, the reporter specially visited Wang Chonghui, Yan Huiqing, Wang Zhengting, Zuo Shunsheng, Zheng Yuxiu and other elders of the diplomatic and legal circles and social celebrities to inquire about their opinions. Summarizing the talks of the gentlemen, they believe that the US military's stationing in China was with the consent of our government to assist in the work of repatriating remains. Once the mission is completed, they should withdraw on their own, which is not enough to constitute diplomatic discussion material. We believe that in order to maintain world peace, it is best not to form the Soviet Union's two major camps in the world, so as not to threaten peace.

### Enthusiastic Discussion Lasts Three Hours; Legislative Yuan Passes Conscription Law; Women of Eligible Age May Receive Military Education

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Legislative Yuan convened its 308th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th. Seventy-one committee members attended, including Ding Mo, He Sui, Wei Tingsheng, Liu Keshu, Chen Changheng, Jian Guansan, and Liu Guanxun. President Sun chaired the meeting. At the beginning, the entire assembly observed a three-minute silence to mourn the recent passing of deceased committee member Ling Yue and deceased committee member Peng Yangguang. Subsequently, the following agenda items were discussed: (1) The report from the Criminal Law Committee of the Yuan, in conjunction with the Legal System Committee, regarding the examination of the draft regulations for handling cases of traitors in the northeastern provinces and cities. A resolution was passed, stating that, based on the examination report, there was no need to formulate separate regulations. (2) The report from the Military Affairs Committee of the Yuan, in conjunction with the Legal System Committee, regarding the examination of the revised draft of the Conscription Law. During the discussion of this item, Xu Siping, Director of the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, was present to answer questions and explain the content. The draft was discussed clause by clause, with heated debate lasting three hours. A resolution was finally passed, approving the revisions. The full text consists of 35 articles, divided into ten chapters. Article 1 stipulates that "All male citizens of the Republic of China have the obligation to serve in the military according to law." Military service includes officer service, non-commissioned officer service, and soldier service. Service begins on January 1st of the year following the attainment of age 18 and continues until December 31st of the year of attaining age 45, when discharge occurs. Military service is divided into three categories: active duty service, reserve service, and national guard service. The first two categories are further divided into active duty and reserve duty. National guard service is divided into three types: initial service, Type A, and Type B. Comprehensive regulations are in place regarding service management, conscription, mobilization, rights, obligations, and penalties. Article 33 stipulates that women of eligible age may receive appropriate military auxiliary service education during peacetime and may be conscripted for military auxiliary service during wartime. Furthermore, the original regulations stipulated only four conditions for postponing mobilization and conscription for reserve and national guard service. After many argued that graduates of normal schools who have served as primary school teachers for more than one year should also be eligible for postponement, this was also approved. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.

Resolution to Abolish Wartime Land Requisition Tax Regulations

The meeting resumed at 2:30 PM, and the following matters were discussed: (1) The Legal System Committee reported on its examination of the draft regulations for the Haihe Engineering Bureau's organization. A resolution was passed approving the revised draft. (2) The Legal System Committee of the Yuan reported on its examination of the draft regulations for the organization of the Central Biochemical Manufacturing and Experimental Institute. A resolution was passed approving the revised draft with amendments. (3) The Criminal Law Committee of the Yuan, in conjunction with the Economic Committee and the Finance Committee, reported on its examination of the draft regulations for revising and increasing the standards for wartime fines. A resolution was passed approving the revised draft with amendments. According to the new regulations, for fines imposed under the Criminal Law or other laws, the original amount will be increased up to one hundred times. For those who can commute a fine or be sentenced to labor, each day will be calculated as between 300 and 1,000 yuan. For those who are fined administratively, the original amount will be increased up to fifty times. If, according to Article 5 of the Administrative Execution Law, increasing the fine is still insufficient, the original amount may be increased up to fifty times. (4) The Finance Committee of the Yuan, in conjunction with the Land Law Committee, reported on its review of the proposal to abolish the Wartime Land Requisition Tax Regulations. A resolution was passed that, according to the review, the regulations should be abolished. The meeting adjourned at 5:50 PM.

Resolution to Submit the Kowloon and Hong Kong Phased Recovery Case for Review

[This Newspaper Nanjing Report, 28th] During the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 28th, committee members Chen Anren and others proposed that the Yuan petition the National Government to order the diplomatic authorities to negotiate with Britain, based on the spirit of the Sino-British New Treaty, for the phased recovery of Kowloon and Hong Kong, in order to protect national sovereignty and enhance Sino-British friendship. This proposal was sent for review. A proposal to exempt export taxes, along with a draft export trade regulation, was not passed. The original proposal specified the following categories of goods for permitted export: (1) Rice, grains, wheat, flour, miscellaneous grains, and their finished products. (2) Salt. (3) All kinds of live wild birds and beasts. (4) Fowl with feathers, fowl skin with feathers, and wild bird feathers with a small amount of fowl skin. (5) Machine-woven cotton yarn and cloth. (6) Raw hides, tanned hides. (7) Fuel. (8) Iron, tin, mercury, and iron-tin ore, etc. Committee members spoke enthusiastically, believing that food and raw materials should not be exported, and that fuel was still in short supply and should be prohibited from export. They argued that if such regulations were passed, the people would inevitably suffer from hunger and cold, and that encouraging the import of all finished goods would cause prices to continue to rise. At the same time, questions were raised about the reasons for exempting import duties on items such as American cars, which were considered incomprehensible. As the import tariff regulations had not yet been finalized, it was resolved to send the matter to the Finance and Economic Committee for review together. Finally, Jian Guansan, Zhang Fengjiu, Liu Zhiping, and others made a temporary motion to "draft measures for accommodating unemployed high school graduates and request approval from the National Defense Conference," but it was not discussed due to the lateness of the hour.

### Alas, Great Spoils of Victory Transformed into Useless Objects; Many Captured Vehicles Received in Hunan Are Dismantled

Qiu Ao Discusses Impressions of Visiting Hunan

[This Newspaper Hankou Report, 27th] Qiu Ao, the head of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Investigation Team, arrived in Hankou at 4:00 PM today. He met with reporters that evening to discuss his experiences and impressions from the investigation in Hunan. Qiu pointed out that one important characteristic of the corruption in Hunan's takeover process was that there were very few scholars in long gowns, but rather many soldiers in military uniforms. These takeover personnel were mostly subordinates of the former Fourth Front Army. As the troops had been transferred and deployed elsewhere, not only had the people left, but little remained, making it impossible to conduct a thorough investigation in a short period of time. He could only express his deepest regret. He then provided explanations of the cases that had already been handled: (A) The most frequent reports concerned captured vehicles. The main culprit was Shen Dake, Deputy Director of the Sichuan-Hunan Highway Bureau. He had received a total of 3,438 captured vehicles, 19,186 gallons of gasoline, and 107 tons of auto parts in Changsha. These captured military vehicles were not officially allocated to various agencies until April and May of this year. However, many important parts had been removed. In 677 vehicles, the entire engine had been completely removed, and each vehicle was missing an average of three tires. The 500 vehicles stored in Yueyang were even completely dismantled, turning the great spoils of victory into useless objects, which was truly heartbreaking. Furthermore, it was found that the official had falsely reported the number of vehicles, concealed materials and tools, and sold captured vehicles without authorization. More than 130 vehicles had already been found to have been purchased privately by businesses in addition to government agencies. He was suspected of embezzlement and corruption, and the case had been transferred to the judicial authorities for investigation and legal action. (B) Military supplies that could still be investigated were originally stored in four mixed warehouses in Changsha, Yueyang, Hengyang, and Xiangtan. These warehouses had been transferred to the Hunan Supply Office. Spot checks of the goods in each warehouse revealed that some rowing machines, printing presses, and other communication equipment had been damaged and placed in piles. Recommendations had been made to the central government to allocate these items for use in Hunan. (C) In the economic sector, in addition to reporting that Wei Yong and Yin Xing, executives of a bank, had concealed property and secretly absconded, it was also discovered that the former Fourth Front Army had received 513 dan of contraband salt from traitors, and the former 18th Army had received 50,000 shi dan of enemy salt, neither of which had been handed over to the Supply Office. These matters were being reported for review. There were two more significant cases in Changsha and Yueyang, but because the individuals and the stolen goods were at large, the court was investigating, and it was not appropriate to disclose the details at this time.

### Editorial: The Return of the Greek King

King George II of Greece left England by plane on the 27th to return to Greece and regain his throne. After World War I, the Greek king fled in 1924 when Greece declared a republic. After 11 years of wandering, he returned to the throne after a successful plebiscite. During World War II, Greece was defeated, and the king fled again. On September 1st of this year, a plebiscite showed that 75% of the population favored restoration. Now he has returned to the throne for the second time.

In the midst of the democratic tide of the 20th century, the majority of the Greek people actually rejected democracy and wanted a monarch. This is not because they do not love freedom, nor is it because they have a special affection for George II. Rather, it is the development of the international situation that forces them to make a choice between monarchy and democracy, or, to put it bluntly, between the two major blocs of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union.

Geographically, Greece is the gateway to the Balkan Peninsula and the most important key to the Aegean Sea. If the Soviet Union wants to control the Middle East and the Balkans, it must first secure the Dardanelles Strait in Turkey and second, the Aegean Sea in Greece. However, the people and governments of both countries do not sympathize with the Soviet Union. Their own strength is not enough to resist Soviet oppression. They have to rely on foreign aid, and the most reliable foreign aid is undoubtedly Britain. Because Britain's influence in the Middle East is not as great as before, and the countries of the Balkan Peninsula have completely embraced the Soviet Union, Britain has to help Turkey and Greece for its own interests. As for the United States, it has consistently supported Britain both during and after the war, and has always taken a consistent approach to the Soviet Union. Therefore, Turkey and Greece can get help from the United States by getting help from Britain.

Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris saw this situation clearly long ago and has always been friendly to Britain. British troops have been stationed in Greece for two years without withdrawing, and the Greek government's army has also been constantly supplied with British arms. As for King George, he fled first to Cairo and then to London, where he enjoyed a harmonious relationship with the British government and people. If Greece does not want to be a vassal of the Soviet Union, and the Greek people do not want to accept the Soviet Union's "new-style democracy," which is the dictatorship of the Communist Party, their only way out is to court Britain diplomatically. King George II and Prime Minister Tsaldaris are of course the most appropriate representatives of this diplomatic line. Under these circumstances, 75% of the Greek voters also expressed their welcome to George II's return to the throne.

However, the Greek Communist Party is heartbroken by George II's victory. They tried their best to disrupt the plebiscite, but the government's strict precautions prevented them from succeeding. They immediately declared the election invalid and filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council against Britain. At the same time, they obtained arms from the Soviet vassal Albania and Yugoslavia and launched a civil war in the northern mountains. Although the Greek government forces are now in the majority, it is still very difficult to eliminate them completely because the Communist Party has foreign aid.

Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris issued a written statement to foreign journalists on the 25th, saying, in brief: "The war has been transferred from abroad to Greece in order to use the chaotic situation to obtain an outlet to the Aegean Sea. This is obvious. A foreign power is using its veto power in the United Nations Security Council to prevent the organization of an international investigation team to inspect the Greek border." At the same time, in London, a spokesman for the Greek embassy also said: "The fierce fighting in the northern mountainous areas of Greece is caused by saboteurs infiltrating from Albania and Yugoslavia." In addition, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated: "If the Greek police and army fail to fulfill their duties, then British troops will ultimately come out to maintain order." These three statements can explain the actual situation in Greece now and Britain's clear attitude. Even with King George II's return to the country this time, his reign is not very peaceful.

We believe that since the world's five great powers are now all extolling democracy, they should not interfere in the internal affairs and diplomacy of any country in the world. The majority of people in a country should have full power to decide their own political system and choose their true friends in the international community. Domestic minority political groups should also use democratic means, legal procedures, and open stances to win the trust of the people. Foreign countries should not interfere unreasonably, and opposition parties should not resort to begging for foreign aid and launching civil wars. Now that the majority of the people in Greece, more than 75%, have already made a legitimate expression, Albania and Yugoslavia have no reason to continue to support the minority and disturb the peace of the majority of the Greek people. As for the Greek Communist Party, it should not go against the will of the people and use force to seize power. Not to mention that under the current situation, the seizure will not succeed, even if it succeeds, it will eventually collapse because the majority of the people in the country refuse to support it.

[Our Correspondent] Athens, Paris, 8th (Radio Broadcast): Escorted by a guard of honor, King George II traveled from Phaleron Port.

Princess Irene and Princess Helena of Greece, attended by Mrs. Tsaermi and court ladies, stood temporarily in the cathedral's front cloister. Archbishop Damaskinos, resplendent in golden embroidered vestments, his white beard reaching his chest, slowly walked towards the cloister, holding a gold-embossed copy of the Holy Gospel. He presented it to the King, who ceremoniously kissed it. Also appearing in the cloister were resistance leaders from Crete, Macedonia, and Thessaloniki. Prominent figures from various Greek ministries, leaders of the army and navy, diplomatic corps and the heads of Allied missions, as well as representatives from organizations like the League of Red Cross Societies, gathered in the hall to offer their congratulations. Meanwhile, in the steep mountains of northern and central Greece, the fires of civil war continued to rage.

I take this opportunity to bid farewell to the people and government of your nation, and to express my heartfelt thanks for their generous hospitality over the past five years."

### Peace Conference Committee Passes Italy-Yugoslavia Border Line: Yugoslav Representative Threatens to Refuse Signing Peace Treaty, Trieste Communists Hold Large-Scale Demonstration

[Our Correspondent] Paris, 8th (Radio Broadcast): Yugoslavia had previously stated that it would refuse to sign the peace treaty with Italy unless it obtained the entire Venezia Giulia peninsula. The Peace Conference's Political Committee on Italy today passed, by a vote of twelve to five, the Four Powers' proposal using the "French Line" as the Italy-Yugoslavia border, with three abstentions. The Yugoslav representative's opposition was unsuccessful, and the Yugoslav representative threatened on the spot to refuse to sign the peace treaty and to have Yugoslav troops refuse to withdraw from Trieste. The Soviet bloc countries supported them. According to the "French Line," the peninsula would be divided in two, with three-quarters annexed to Yugoslavia, and the remaining one-quarter narrow strip designated to Italy, surrounding the free port of Trieste.

[Our Correspondent] Paris, 8th (Radio Broadcast): Trieste – The question of the status of the free zone of the Port of Trieste continues to cause discontent among the people of Venezia Giulia.

Similar demonstrations occurred in Gorizia, where police intervention was ineffective.

### Britain and the United States Propose New Suggestion to Convene Danube River Conference to Establish International Control System: Soviet Union Opposes, Attempting to Monopolize Shipping

[United Press, Paris, 27th] Britain recently presented a new proposal at the Paris Peace Conference, advocating for the convening of an international conference to discuss the Danube River issue. The conference should be attended by countries along the Danube River and the major powers and should establish an organization for the international control of the Danube River. It is reported that the United States has expressed support for this proposal, but the Soviet Union opposes this view, advocating that the countries along the Danube River should exclusively control the Danube River, excluding other major powers from controlling the river. The Soviet Union considers itself one of the countries along the Danube River.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, New York, 8th] Today, at the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the Soviet representative accused the United States of directly interfering in the internal affairs of countries related to Danube River navigation and condemned the U.S. occupying forces for detaining Czechoslovakian ships and refusing to return them, attempting to exert pressure on the two countries in order to achieve its goals in Southeastern Europe. Previously, representatives of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia suggested to the Economic and Social Council that the United States should return 214 ships detained by the U.S. authorities in the U.S. occupied zones of Germany and Austria. U.S. representative Winant immediately proposed to the Council that the Soviet Union, the United States, and Southeastern European countries hold a meeting in Vienna by November 1 to resolve the current obstacles to restoring international navigation on the Danube River. The Soviet representative then made this explosive statement, directly accusing the United States of attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries.

### Joint Defense of Straits Rejected by Turkey: Soviet Union Launches Propaganda Offensive, Accusing Turkey of Being Manipulated by Britain and the United States

[Associated Press, London, 28th] The Soviet Union announced today that Turkey, in its note of August 24, "did not refute" the accusation that it had allowed the Axis powers to use the Dardanelles Strait, which is under Turkish administration, for war purposes. TASS reported that the Soviet government formally announced that Turkey had rejected two Soviet proposals: one for the Black Sea countries to conclude a treaty to replace the Montreux Convention, and the other for a joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the straits, on the grounds that this would "contradict Turkish sovereignty."

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th] Last night, Soviet radio broadcast an appeal to the Turkish people, accusing Turkish reactionaries of being manipulated by British and American imperialism. It stated that Turkish newspapers and radio stations ignore Marshal Stalin's call for peace and continue to portray the international situation as extremely bleak. This strategy is intended to conceal the domestic situation and willingly be manipulated by foreign imperialists. These imperialists are attempting to gain ground in Turkey. In addition to obtaining various bases near the Turkish Straits, Britain has also dispatched more than 5,000 experts to Turkish military academies to carry out activities.

### Issue of Repatriation of Japanese Nationals from Soviet Territory: U.S. and Soviet Representatives to Resume Negotiations

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] A spokesperson for General MacArthur's headquarters recently announced that General MacArthur will conduct negotiations with Soviet General Derevyanko, the Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, regarding the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and civilians from Soviet territory. General Derevyanko informed headquarters that he had been ordered by his government to be responsible for commencing negotiations with General MacArthur. Negotiations for the repatriation of Japanese nationals were previously held in June but were terminated in July due to a deadlock. At that time, General Derevyanko stated that he was only responsible for discussing the repatriation of Japanese nationals from northern Korea and certain regions of the three eastern provinces of China. The hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners detained in the Soviet Union proper were not within the scope of discussion. However, the current negotiations will include all Japanese prisoners in the Soviet Union proper, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. It is reported that General Derevyanko's representatives and General MacArthur's representatives will soon begin discussing the details of the negotiations. According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union plans to repatriate Japanese nationals from ports in eastern Siberia starting in October, at a rate of 10,000 to 15,000 per month, and from ports in southern Sakhalin, at a rate of 7,000 to 10,000 per month.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] The Japanese Parliament will convene today and propose a resolution calling for the accelerated repatriation of Japanese military personnel and civilians in Soviet territory. Female staff members from various parties will support this resolution and deliver speeches.

### Paris Indian Government Representatives Hold Secret Negotiations with Soviet Union

[Our Correspondent] Paris, 8th (Radio Broadcast): Representatives of the Indian Provisional Government are holding secret negotiations with Soviet representatives in Paris. Due to the confidential nature of the matter, the content of the talks has not been announced. British representatives are very concerned about this. The Indian representatives are scheduled to return home tomorrow to report to Nehru.

[Reuters, Moscow, 27th] "Izvestia" commented on the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government, stating that Britain asked Nehru to form the Indian Provisional Government in order to shift the responsibility for the country's economic crisis and ethnic strife onto the shoulders of the Congress Party. This move can be seen as a concession by the British to the Indian national movement. The members of the Indian government are different from the executive members of the Indian Governor, but since the leaders of the Congress Party have accepted the responsibility of governing, they will have to accept considerable limitations on their original demands. As the new government is not responsible to the Indian legislature, and the British army has not expressed any intention of withdrawing from India, and the British side has reaffirmed that the previous constitutional status remains unchanged, this is Britain's trick to exchange small favors for large benefits.

### A Comparison of the Paris Peace Conferences of 1919 and 1946 (Part 2)

— Lu Yu

(4) Differences in Organization

In terms of organizational structure, there are four major differences between the previous peace conference and this one. I will elaborate on them separately: First, the subordinate system of the peace conference - as mentioned earlier, the 1919 peace conference was vested with full power to handle the Treaty of Versailles with Germany. Therefore, the peace conference at that time was a supreme power organ, with no higher-level agency above it. This peace conference is only of an advisory nature. Above it is the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. Most of the proposals discussed by the peace conference are proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, and the resolutions passed by the peace conference still need to be finally reviewed by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. Second, the relationship between the peace conference and international peace organizations - when the previous peace conference opened, the League of Nations had not yet been established. The League of Nations was a product of the Treaty of Versailles passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Therefore, there was a peace conference first, and then the League of Nations. When this peace conference was convened, the United Nations already existed and had already begun its activities. The design of the United Nations was far before the end of the war, so its creation has nothing to do with the peace conference. Third, the internal organization of the peace conference - the internal organizational structure of the previous peace conference can be described in four words: "a conference within a conference." Above the plenary session (attended by all participating countries) was the "Council of Ten" (composed of the US President and Secretary of State and the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan). Above the "Council of Ten" was the "Council of Four" (composed of the leaders of the US, Britain, France, and Italy). After Italian representative Orlando angrily left Paris over the Fiume issue, the "Council of Four" was changed to the "Council of Three." These three heads of state were US President Wilson, British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and French Prime Minister Clemenceau. This council was the agency with the power to "have the last word" in the peace conference and was held in extreme secrecy. In addition, the daily affairs and review work of the peace conference were the responsibility of the designated 58 subcommittees. The organizational structure of this peace conference is much simpler than that of the 1919 peace conference. It is divided into only three parts: the plenary session, the subcommittees, and the secretariat. The plenary session decides on various issues and submits them to the relevant subcommittees for research. The subcommittees then submit reports on the issues submitted by the plenary session and provide various opinions for the plenary session to adopt. The number of subcommittees is also far fewer than the number established by the previous peace conference, with only nine: (1) Political Committee for the Treaty with Italy, (2) Political Committee for the Treaty with Romania, (3) Political Committee for the Treaty with Bulgaria, (4) Political Committee for the Treaty with Hungary, (5) Political Committee for the Treaty with Finland, (6) Economic Committee for the Treaty with Italy, (7) Economic Committee for the Treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, (8) Military Committee for the Treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, (9) Legal Committee. In addition to the above-mentioned nine special committees, the conference also established an integrated committee, with the participation of all member states, whose task was to coordinate the work of other committees. However, although this peace conference does not have the phenomenon of "a conference within a conference," it has the characteristic of "a conference outside the conference," which is the aforementioned Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. Fourth, the attitude of the peace conference towards the defeated countries - the attitude of the 1919 peace conference towards the defeated country - Germany - was extremely severe. It was not allowed to attend the meeting and speak, and it was forced to accept the treaty unconditionally. This peace conference is different. It invited the five former enemy countries - Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland - to attend the plenary session and subcommittees of the peace conference and allowed them to express their opinions orally or submit requests in writing. This attitude of treating the defeated countries with leniency is worthy of praise. This change may be due to the fact that today is an era of democracy, and a treaty monopolized by the victorious countries may be criticized by democratic and freedom-loving people around the world, or it may be because the current international situation is more tense and subtle than in 1919, and the major powers are trying to use or win over the former enemy countries to increase the power of their own group.

### Endangering the Livelihoods of the Southeastern Half of the Country: Chuan Shishuo Sentenced to Death: Heard the Verdict with Tears in His Eyes, Wife and Daughters Faced Him in Sorrow: Li Zulie Sentenced to Five Years in Prison

[Our Correspondent] Chuan Shishuo, one of the top figures in the puppet government, was sentenced to death by the High Court yesterday, deprived of all civil rights for life. In summary, the defendant initially participated in the establishment of the puppet national government due to weak will and then served as the puppet Minister of Railways and Construction. Later, as the puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province, he implemented the "Rural Clearing Campaign," endangering the livelihoods of the southeastern half of the country. In summary, his actions were unforgivable, so he was sentenced to death as a warning to others. Chuan was wearing a gray robe and leather shoes, his spirits were failing, and his face changed when he heard the verdict. He almost shed tears. The presiding judge explained the main points of the verdict, stating that the defendant's entire property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of his family, would be confiscated. The presiding judge informed him that if he did not agree with the verdict, he could apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial within ten days of receiving the verdict, otherwise the court would request it on his behalf. Fu did not say much, only requesting the court to allow him to speak with his family for a few words in a broken, tearful voice. The presiding judge replied that today's time was tight, and he could meet them in prison another day. After saying that, he was ordered to be taken back into custody. His wife and daughters followed behind him, tearful and miserable. His daughter even whispered "Dad," and Chuan looked at them with tearful eyes, filled with endless sadness.

In addition, Li Fulai, deputy manager of the Shanghai branch of the puppet Bank of China and chairman of the Fulai Money Exchange, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for five years, and his entire property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of his family, was confiscated. When Li heard the verdict, he immediately asked the court, "Is the sentence for the crime of disrupting the financial system? Or another crime?" The presiding judge replied, "Conspiring with an enemy country to plot to revolt against one's own country." After the court allowed him to speak with his family for a few words, he was taken back to prison by the bailiffs.

### Another Puppet Government Bigwig, Chen Chunpu, Case Concluded: Claims During "Governorship" He Was Merely "House Sitting," Clever Arguments Too Late to Regret

[Our Correspondent] After Chuan Shishuo was sentenced to death by the High Court yesterday, on the same day, another puppet government bigwig, Chen Chunpu, had his case concluded by the High Court, with the verdict scheduled for October 4.

Chen is currently 47 years old, from Xinhui, Guangdong. He is related to the inner circle of Wang Jingwei and is the leader of the "Public House Faction." He was originally a member of the Kuomintang and served in various party and government agencies for a long time. Later, he became the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and the director of the Overseas Chinese Education Office. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Wang Jingwei colluded with the Japanese invaders, betrayed the country and sought peace. Chen defected in secret and left Chongqing in December of the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. Later, Wang Jingwei negotiated a "Basic Peace Program" with the enemy invaders in Shanghai and prepared to organize a puppet government. Chen was summoned to serve as his private secretary, following him closely. After the negotiations were concluded, they jointly usurped Nanjing, established a puppet regime under the wings of the Japanese invaders and Wang Jingwei. In March of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], he took office as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Executive Yuan, concurrently serving as the Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Political Committee and the Executive Committee member and Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Central Executive Committee. In October of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was transferred to the Minister of the Puppet Construction Department. In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he concurrently served as the Minister of the Puppet Central Party Department's Organization Department. In April of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he was transferred to the Governor of Guangdong Province and concurrently served as the Director of the Puppet Guangdong Pacification Office. He was dismissed in February of the 34th year of the Republic [1945] and appointed as a member of the Puppet National Government until the victory. After the victory, he was arrested and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office.

Chen, dressed in a blue-gray long gown and wearing rimless glasses, defended himself on several points: (1) In December of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], he accompanied Wang's children to Hong Kong to study and was not colluding in advance to betray the country by leaving Chongqing first. (2) He did not know anything about the published "Yan Telegram". He only learned about it in the newspapers in Hong Kong afterward. (3) As Wang's private secretary, he only managed the affairs within the official residence. The political telegrams and document exchanges were handled by another confidential secretary. (4) He did not participate in the "Nanjing Talks", "Xu Island Talks", signing the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty", "Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty", publishing the "Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Declaration", or the "Declaration of War against Britain and the United States". He never followed Wang on his many trips to Japan. As for whether the defendant participated in the "Qingdao Talks" and "Nanjing Talks", Tao Xisheng and Gao Zongwu can be questioned to provide proof. (5) The positions of Puppet Deputy Secretary-General and other positions were mostly nominal. All matters were handled by the Puppet Secretary-General. (6) During his tenure in the Puppet Construction Department, he never signed any clauses that lost sovereignty. On the contrary, he built water conservancy projects, such as projects. (7) His time as the puppet Governor of Guangdong Province was only eight months, and it was all "house sitting" in nature, similar to a puppet. However, he worked hard to suppress food prices, improve people's livelihoods, and the price of rice in Guangdong was the lowest in the occupied areas at that time. (8) Over the years, he has strictly prohibited gambling, eradicated opium seedlings, organized winter relief, and subsidized charitable undertakings, all of which he believes are beneficial to the country and the people, and he also raised more than 4 million in patriotic bonds before leaving Chongqing. (9) The term "Public House Faction" was coined by the Japanese to create division. In reality, it does not exist. He also stated two points: (1) In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], he lost his party membership because he did not participate in the general registration of party members. (2) On September 17 of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he declared to the Central Statistics Bureau that he had lost his footing for a while. He was determined to resign and only held an empty title of Puppet National Government member.

### Xie Xiao Requests Mercy, Leave Some Reputation

On the same day, several other cases were investigated: Xie Xiaochu, general manager of Zhonghua Chemical Company, was accused of serving as the chairman of the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Trade Association and a standing committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday, Ye Xuesong, Fang Zifan, Wu Wenqing, Shen Songxi, and others were summoned to testify. When questioned, the defendant claimed that in order to maintain his industry, he organized the trade association, otherwise he would not be allowed to operate. This was all out of necessity, as evidenced by the acquittal of the former chairman of the Shanghai Wooden Clothes Trade Association. He now only hopes that the court will show mercy and leave him some reputation so that he can do something again when he gets out, otherwise he will not be able to survive. The court hearing was adjourned for further questioning.

In addition, Fan Qizhu Yongnian was accused of using hardware and grain to support the enemy. Wang Zhenchuan, who once served as the chief of the Suzhou Tax Bureau's branch office, was also investigated once, and the court hearing was adjourned for further questioning.

### City Council Petition Delegation to Nanjing Seeks Opinions from Industry and Commerce Yesterday's Meeting Gathered More Than 100 People The National Federation of Industry and Commerce Will Be Established in Shanghai

Luo Qinghua, standing director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, is about to represent the City Council to petition the government, requesting the government to provide practical relief and support to the Shanghai industry and commerce, which is on the verge of collapse. He especially invited people from the industry and commerce community in the city to express their opinions at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, so as to forward them to the authorities for reference. More than 100 celebrities from the industry and commerce community attended. Mr. Luo first delivered a speech, stating that the future of Shanghai industry and commerce is precarious. Two months ago, the Chamber of Commerce organized an industry and commerce petition led by Mr. Liu to go to Nanjing to petition the central government, but it did not achieve the main point. In mid-August, the government adjusted the exchange rate, intending to support industry and commerce, but because the industry and commerce community is deeply and heavily troubled, this measure is not enough. It is expected that there will be major changes in China's political economy in one or two months, because the National Assembly is scheduled to be convened on November 12 of this year. The government is determined to implement constitutional government and return power to the people. At that time, it is expected that a new economic policy will be established, which will help the development of industry and commerce. The Shanghai City Council has many suggestions on the government's economic and financial policies, and it has also decided to recommend eleven councilors to represent the city to petition in Nanjing. The petition delegation is scheduled to depart on the 30th, and will meet with the Chairman and make specific suggestions to the competent authorities, in order to save the industry and commerce, which is as dangerous as eggs piled up. Then, Mr. Luo presented a report on the preparation of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, and predicted that the headquarters of the association would be established in Shanghai in the future. At that time, Shanghai's position in the national industry and commerce will be even more important. Finally, he asked the participants to express their opinions. Shou Jingwei, director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, first stood up and gave a brief report on the situation of the previous industry and commerce petition delegation, and congratulated the success of this City Council petition delegation. Then, Pan Shihao, Yu Huancheng, Xie Hengcong and others made speeches one after another. Mr. Pan predicted that this petition by the City Council representing public opinion will be more fruitful than the previous one. He said that the Chairman is now in Nanjing, and the Chairman loves the country and the people, and values public opinion most. He is expected to adopt many specific suggestions from public opinion institutions. Mr. Yu strongly stated that the government should firmly support industry and commerce and encourage production, and said that the biggest pain of the industry and commerce community recently is being oppressed by high interest rates. Under the current situation of "currency inflation and credit tightening", they cannot breathe, which has led to high prices and industrial and commercial decline. To save this situation, it is necessary to "tighten the currency and expand credit". His words were very insightful, and the whole audience responded with warm applause. The meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m.

### The First Group of the Investigation Team The Work Report Will Be Published Soon The Naval Headquarters Occupies School Buildings Negotiations for Relocation Have Not Yet Yielded Results

[Our Newspaper News] The first group of the investigation team for receiving and handling enemy and puppet materials in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is about to end and will publish a work report. Due to insufficient personnel, short time, and the fact that the investigation period was quite a long time from the receiving period, and the records were incomplete, the work could not be completed thoroughly. Group Leader Zhang told this reporter his thoughts on the work of the investigation team, saying: Investigation work is about getting to the bottom of things, but there is a bottom below the bottom, and there is a seabed outside the riverbed. The authorities' misguided policies, disorganized organization, and slow handling are the "riverbed" found by the investigation team; while the lack of political ideas and weak legal concepts of the administrators are the "seabed". Only those with ideas have faith and can earnestly fulfill the Three Principles of the People. Having a legal concept will prevent illegal behavior. The greatest significance of the work of the investigation team is to correct the policies of the administrative authorities and change the social atmosphere.

[Another News] The Naval Headquarters occupies the Dagong Vocational School at the intersection of Ye Road and Jumen Road. The investigation team has sent a letter to negotiate, but it has not received a reply. The investigation team has now sent another letter to the headquarters, urging them to move out quickly and return the school to its original owner. In addition, the investigation team is reviewing the original manifest of the Zhanghua Woolen Mill received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Yesterday's inquiry revealed that only the original receiving manifest was obtained, and the original manifest handed over by the enemy has not yet been found.

After the victory, the defendant was captured by the investigation office of the Third War Zone Commander-in-Chief and transferred to the military tribunal.

Kuhuo Shinohara is extremely sinful

Kuhuo Shinohara served in the Japanese Shanghai Gendarmerie Water Unit. On March 26, 34th year of the Republic of China, he arrested the victim Chai Zhenyou and took him to the team for interrogation. He was detained for four days and tortured nine times, bleeding all over. He was also ordered to kneel naked on the terrazzo floor and beaten and kicked violently with bamboo and leather boots. After the victory, the criminal was captured and concentrated in Shanghai. The victim reported to the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War Suffering Comrades Association, and the National Defense War Criminal Management Office detained him and transferred him to the military tribunal.

Korean Zhang Xiqiu assisted the enemy in implementing puppet politics

Zhang Xiqiu initially opened a brothel in Xiamen in the 28th year of the Republic of China. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, he changed to operating transportation ships and colluded with Nagasaki, the captain of the enemy's naval police team headquarters. In addition to providing intelligence, he also jointly organized the Xingya Company with others in May of the 35th year of the Republic of China. The defendant invested 4 million puppet Central Reserve notes and served as a director. The company transported rice, sugar, and other items from Zhangzhou Shikou and other places to Xiamen, and most of them were sold to the trading unions under the control of the invaders.

### A Russian Killed His Wife Lied That He Was Assassinated Time Inconsistent Kitchen Knife Showed Clues Several Points Enough to Prove Botched the Case and Detained for Interrogation

[Our Newspaper News] Durminov, a Russian, 38 years old, lived on the third floor of No. 69 Zhaozhu Road. He used to be a Western detective in the French Patrol. After the victory, he was a military police officer in the U.S. Army Corps, and is now a construction broker. His wife, Inusova, 45 years old, has been married for nine years. Their relationship is weak and quarrels often occur. At about 3:30 p.m. yesterday, Durminov suddenly went to the Changshu Road Police Station to report that his wife, Inusova, had been assassinated and killed. The head of the Zhao Branch Bureau, Wang Duanhong, the chief of the criminal section, and member Da Cheng rushed to investigate. They saw the deceased lying in a pool of blood on the floor of the pavilion, with a knife in the head, a knife in the left back of the neck, and a knife in the left eyebrow corner. The trachea had been cut. Not long after, the Foreign Affairs Section of the General Bureau also sent personnel to the scene, and Quan Tao, the chief clerk of the District Procuratorate, also led a forensic doctor to conduct an examination. After a long period of research by the police, they discovered that the husband was highly suspected: (1) According to his statement, he went out at 9 a.m., but according to a Westerner across the street, he was still pacing in the room at 10:30 a.m. (2) At about 10 a.m., a Russian living with him heard a cry for help downstairs. He ordered Ama to come down to ask what was going on, and the agent replied that nothing was wrong. (3) The night before last, they had an argument over keeping a cat, and the quarrel could be heard outdoors. A careful examination revealed that the blood on the floor had congealed into blood clots, which was definitely not the case if the murder had occurred in the afternoon. Later, a kitchen knife used in the murder was found in the drawer in the bathroom. Although it was extremely sharp, there was no blood stain, and there was a water stain, indicating that it had been washed after use. The furniture, tables, and chairs in the room were messy. Based on the above points, Durminov was undoubtedly the murderer of his wife. Later, the agent Minov was taken back to the police station for strict interrogation. At the same time, someone was sent to investigate his mistress. It has been found that there are clues, and it will not be difficult to get to the bottom of the matter.

### The Murder Case at the Guoguang Dyeing and Weaving Factory All Six Murderers Have Been Arrested The Dismissal of Workers Led to Hatred and Turned into a Tragedy

[Our Newspaper News] At midnight on the 17th, the workers of the Guoguang Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 659 Meizhou Road, Yangshupu, Yu Zhongfu, Yu Zhonggui, Cheng Yuhong, and Yu Zhongfu's son Yunxiong, were returning home when they were ambushed by six thugs who had been ambushed at the Baijia Garden of Qiqihar Road Zhangjiabang Guangyu Elementary School West First Wasteland. The thugs blocked the way, stabbed them with knives, causing Yu Zhonggui to die on the spot, and Yu Zhongfu and Cheng Yuhong were seriously injured. The newspaper has reported this. The next morning, the Xunlin Road Police Station reported the case, and Chief Zhou ordered Chief Liu Ziyuan to arrest the murderers and solve the case within a time limit. Members Wu Wenfa and others searched everywhere and arrested the main culprits in the case, Ji Linhua and Tao Jingen (also known as Wenbiao) from Tongzhou, and four accomplices at No. 3 Languifang, Lanzhou Road. They also found a sharp new kitchen knife and a Boy Scout knife in the clothes box and took them back to the police station for interrogation. According to the confession: The factory dismissed 24 workers on the 15th, and Ji Linhua was also among them. Cheng Yuhong was the foreman, and a week before the incident, he had introduced Yu Zhonggui and others to work in the factory. The factory suspected that Cheng had instigated the layoffs. Tao worked at the Zheng Guanghe Soda Factory and was a fellow villager with Cheng. He had previously asked Cheng to introduce him to work, but it was unsuccessful. On the afternoon of the 15th, Ji Linhua and Tao Jingen met on the road, talked about Cheng Yuhong's character, and both expressed dissatisfaction, so they had the idea of killing Cheng. So, on that day, they went to the Jishun Knife Shop on Hankou Road, Hubei Road and bought a new Boy Scout knife. On the 17th, they went to the Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 640 East Changzhi Road and selected a kitchen knife. That night, they gathered four accomplices and waited at the scene of the incident, resulting in the tragic death of one person and the injury of two others. The case is now awaiting the completion of the interrogation and will be handed over to the judicial authorities for prosecution. It is also reported that Yu Zhongfu and Cheng Yuhong, who had their abdomens broken and intestines flowing out, are still receiving treatment at the Shanghai East Hospital, but their lives are no longer in danger.

### Rayon Yarn and Gauze Prices Soar. Minister Wang Discusses Measures to Suppress Prices.

Necessary Steps Will Be Taken If Necessary. About 5,000 Bales of Yarn Are Shipped South Each Month (Equivalent in Cloth)

[Reported by Our Newspaper] After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs attended and presided over the regular board meeting of the Textile Construction Company in the afternoon at 3:00 PM. After the meeting, he met with reporters and said: The recent soaring of yarn prices is not right, and the government is determined to find ways to suppress them. Although the cost of imported raw cotton has increased since the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, the domestic inventory is very substantial, so it should not have a major impact. In the past month, the joint distribution committee of national and private yarn mills has been able to fulfill its duties in the joint distribution of cotton yarn. However, after the Mid-Autumn Festival, due to the soaring of the US dollar in Shanghai and the booming sales of cloth, the black market price of yarn has also gradually increased, forcing the joint distribution committee to moderately increase the selling price. However, it is still hoped that the mills will show more sacrifice spirit and support the government's determination to suppress prices, and jointly maintain affordable yarn prices. At the same time, it is hoped that industry and commerce will provide more assistance to the government's price stabilization policy. Otherwise, the government will have to take necessary steps. He said: The Textile Industry Management Committee meeting to be held today will discuss measures to suppress yarn prices with private yarn mills. As for the management measures for the shipment of yarn and cloth to the south, they are currently awaiting promulgation after being approved by the Executive Yuan. According to investigations and statistics, the amount of yarn and cloth shipped to the south is expected to be 3,000 bales of yarn and 2,000 bales of cloth (equivalent) per month, totaling 5,000 bales. Therefore, the amount is very limited, and the shipment will not affect yarn prices in this city. Regarding the purchase of new cotton loans, the Four Joint Offices have already approved the loan pledge method, which shows the government's determination to provide support. The collective system will not be used for the procurement method for now, but it is hoped that the purchase price will be consistent. Minister Wang also expressed great concern about the continuous rise in the price of rayon in this city, but said that once Japanese rayon arrives in Shanghai, the market price can be suppressed, and speculators will eventually suffer the consequences. He has confirmed that Ouyang Lun will be appointed as the director of the Industry and Commerce Supervision Office, which is expected to be established next month. Minister Wang is scheduled to return to Nanjing by evening train tonight.

### Yarn Prices Jump by 500,000, and Cotton Cloth Also Soars, Rising Nearly 10,000 Yuan

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The violent rise in yarn prices yesterday was the only seen since the victory. At the beginning of the morning, 20-count yarn immediately rose by 200,000 yuan. However, buyers were not discouraged and absorbed it at a higher price. In no time, it rose another 100,000 yuan. The rise in fine yarn and 42-count double-strand yarn was even more severe. Under the competition of merchants and weaving factories, it also jumped by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) Autumn sales are booming, and there is a shortage of spot goods. (2) The distribution quotas of Textile Construction and private mills are very limited and are futures, so actual users suffer from the fact that distant water cannot quench the immediate thirst, and they have to search for spot goods in the market. (3) The shipment of yarn and cloth to the south is about to open, and Guangdong merchants are resuming purchases. (4) The turnover of Yingkou and Tianjin in the north is rising sharply and cannot be stopped. (5) Hot money is mixed into the yarn and cloth market, buying and hoarding at a higher price, so that futures warehouse receipts flow into the hands of these people, and the chips become even more scarce. (6) The flexible increase in the distribution price of the Joint Distribution Committee and the rise in the price of the yarn market are mutually causal. In short, spot goods are exhausted, and demand exceeds supply. To suppress yarn prices, apart from the large-scale supply of spot goods, it is really a waste of time to rely solely on the distribution of futures. In summary, the initial price of 20-count double-strand yarn was 2 million, and the final price was 2.22 million. The prices of other brands such as Ren Zhong, Tian Nu, Jin Ji, and Da Fa were similar. The price of 42-count yarn was 3.2 million to 3.35 million yuan, which was 300,000 to 500,000 yuan higher than yesterday's price. The cloth market was originally stable, and the opening price in the morning was similar to the previous day. Near noon, due to the aggressive advance of the northern merchants in white goods and the surge in yarn prices, the market was moved to absorb, and the price rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to the morning. The initial price of unlicensed colored balls in the morning was 80,000, and the price at noon was 88,000. Xin Yang He rose from 82,000 to 92,000. Shuiyue Shilin rose from more than 120,000 yuan to nearly 140,000 yuan. Yuan Biji increased by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, totaling 104,000 yuan for Jinlian Miaowu and 108,000 yuan for Sijunzi Baiyin. In general, the market is still expected to rise.

### Off-Exchange Trading: Small Foreign Stocks Rise Slightly, Public Bonds Trading Scarce

Small foreign stocks rose slightly, while large stocks, except for Jardine Matheson, remained flat. Ewo Yarns fell slightly from 9,300 yuan to 9,000 yuan, and British-American Tobacco rose slightly from 10,300 yuan to 10,600 yuan. As a result, the closing prices were generally flat compared to the previous day. Ewo Yarns, Steel, and Ewo Beer rose slightly, British-American Tobacco fell slightly, and Jardine Matheson, Paper, and Shipping each rose by more than half a percent. Public bond trading remained scarce, and the market was still slightly affected by the small amount of funds released by the financial community. It lacked the momentum to rise. Unified C opened at 1,830 yuan, and the low price was no more than 1,800 yuan. It once rose to 1,900 yuan in the middle of the day, and finally hovered around 1,850 yuan, resulting in a rise of 30 yuan compared to the previous closing. A and B rose by 50 yuan, D rose by 20 yuan, and Unified E also rose by 20 yuan. The transaction volume was no more than 3 million yuan in face value.

### Excellent Results of German Cotton, Purchase Price Increased by 20-30%

This spring, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry negotiated with the Joint Office to import 225 tons of American purebred German cotton seeds, which were handed over to the Shanghai Cotton Production Improvement Office for management and distribution to Jiangsu, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces in the Yangtze River Basin for supervised planting. According to reports from all parties, due to its pure and good breeding, vigorous growth, and abundant yield, the new cotton samples of this year have been transported to Shanghai for inspection. The lint is soft, even, and white, and the fibers are fine and long, with an average length of more than one and a quarter inches, and the longest reaching one and three-eighths inches, which is excellent. Shanghai yarn mills are competing to purchase it, and the purchase price of German cotton has been agreed upon by both parties to be 20% higher than the market price of seed cotton and 30% higher than the price of lint cotton as an incentive. A large amount of this high-quality new cotton will arrive in the Shanghai market in mid-next month.

### Tea Production Loan, Total Amount is 10 Billion, Monthly Interest Rate Agreed to be 3%

### Rayon Price Increase Not Yet Over, Factory-Processed Silk and Satin Goods Follow Suit

The rayon price increase has not yet subsided. At the Guangyou on the 120th Sky Bridge yesterday morning, the opening price was 5.2 million yuan, and the maximum was shouted to 400,000 yuan, but it eventually fell due to the high price and lack of interest. Transactions were made as low as 120,000 yuan, and the closing price in the morning was 5.1 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to a small amount of absorption by actual sales users, it was revived, raising the price to 300,000 yuan, which was more than 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day. 75% semi-gloss, with a lot of goods and sluggish sales, the price was not good. Factory-processed transactions were very lively, and the selling price was uniformly raised. 78-80% uniformity B-grade was 4.025 million yuan yesterday, and ordinary goods were also 3.9 million to 3.95 million yuan, which was about 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Silk and satin goods, especially bedding fabrics, were the most popular, and the price was more than 100,000 yuan higher yesterday. The prices of other goods generally increased.

### White Coal Rises Slightly

Due to the news that the Coal Business United Business Office will distribute Hongji lump coal, coal merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is gradually loosening. The prices of all goods have increased slightly.

### Flour Price Not to Exceed 14,000

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Because flour is a daily necessity for citizens, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has stipulated that the price of each bag is 14,000 yuan and warned the Flour Industry Association not to raise the price without authorization. However, in recent days, the retail price of flour from Lao Che Pai, Pao Che Pai, and Bing Chuan Pai has risen to 16,000 to 17,000 yuan per bag.

At the same time, according to a New York dispatch, U.S. officials consider Soviet claims that red, green, and brown cotton can be sold well in the market to be exaggerated. It is claimed that the U.S. grown brown and green cotton varieties have no commercial value because the fiber quality of naturally colored cotton is poor and it fades easily.

### Rationing of Taiwanese Rice Continues; Xian and Geng Rice Show Slight Decline

Yesterday, the rice market calmed as the weather cleared up. High-grade Xian rice dropped 1,000 yuan, while mid- to low-grade varieties fell by over 1,000 yuan. Bai Yuan rice remained sluggish. Newly harvested Geng rice prices stabilized initially, then weakened, while aged Geng rice continued to decline. Rationing of Taiwanese rice continued with 7,050 bags allocated in the southern city at a price of 53,000 yuan per bag. Flour prices remained firm, and bran prices were stable. Wheat from both northern and southern ports remained stagnant with limited transactions, falling by a further 300-400 yuan. Soybeans continued their trend of high prices followed by declines. The supply of broad beans became increasingly scarce with limited stock in the producing regions, leading to continued price increases of 2,000-3,000 yuan. Corn prices were flat, and red sorghum remained similar. Raw peanuts from the southern ports remained unchanged, and the market was temporarily stable. Oil prices were under pressure due to continued arrivals from Qingdao, with raw oil prices falling by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil also weakened, and rapeseed oil followed suit, dropping by 500-600 yuan. Soybean cake weakened by 100 yuan.

### Speculative Funds Focus on Chinese Stocks; Market Sentiment Improves

Chinese stocks opened higher this morning due to the scrutiny of gold and foreign currency transactions, leading to an influx of speculative funds. All stocks opened higher. Yong Yarn soared by half a percent due to speculation. However, this rise was considered too rapid, and prices retreated after opening, triggering selling pressure. Fortunately, diverse buyers continued to arrive. The trading floor helped absorb large volumes of distressed shares, providing support despite unfavorable conditions. Many securities firms sold Yong Yarn to purchase American Asia stocks. As a result, American Asia performed better than Yong Yarn, bolstered by silk yarn prices. Except for Qinxing, which fell to its previous closing price, other stocks declined but remained significantly higher than their previous closings, alleviating the dire situation. Buying interest intensified after 11:00 AM, leading to a rebound. The two leading stocks spurred each other on, generating significant excitement. The three smaller hot stocks were neglected and underperformed. Near noon, the hot stocks rose before quickly falling, with the three smaller stocks falling faster. Near closing, the market became choppy. Yong Yarn closed up just over half a percent, while American Asia was down slightly. The three smaller hot stocks saw minimal gains. Among the cold stocks, cement prices remained flat, while Tongyi, Xinyi, Rongfeng, Huafeng, and Wushe Silk Company each rose by about half a percent. Other stocks saw limited gains, with Datong and Li'an rising by one percent. The total trading volume was over 13.58 million shares. Off-exchange stocks saw only slight gains.

### Rationing of Cotton and Sugar; Divided into No. 1 and No. 2 Grades; Approximately 20,000 Bags

[Our Report] Taiwan Sugar Corporation will begin rationing the first shipment of cotton sugar (refined white sugar) from Taiwan since the victory starting this week, divided into No. 1 and No. 2 grades. No. 1 grade costs 180,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), and No. 2 grade costs 150,000 yuan. It is reported that there are approximately 20,000 bags in stock, with each bag weighing 120 jin (approximately 60 kg).

### China Sugar Warehouse Receipts; Have Fallen Below Rationing Price

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained weak, continuing to decline. The current price for the association's allocated spot goods was only 130,000 yuan, the same as the rationing price. This incurs additional expenses and interest. If the goods were purchased previously, losses would amount to 10,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts fell below the current rationing price by 4,000 yuan, reaching only 126,000 yuan. Raw sugar was priced at 115,000 yuan, down slightly. Jian's group offered 60-70 bags of Diaoging sugar at a price of 100,800 yuan. It is reported that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is scheduled to auction off sugar from vehicles next Monday. A full carload of white sugar is valued at 180,000 yuan, and a half carload is valued at 160,000 yuan, indicating that the market price is moving towards a more stable value.

### Taiwan Dollar at 1:35 Ratio; Approved by the Executive Yuan

[Taiwan Air News] After the Taiwan Provincial Government decided on an exchange rate of one Taiwan dollar to 40 legal tender, it has not yet been approved by the central government, causing inconvenience for currency exchange. After repeated statements of reasons by the Chief Executive's Office, the Executive Yuan has approved a fixed ratio of 1:35. The Bank of Taiwan has already listed this exchange rate.

### Audit Comes to an End; Gold and Foreign Currency Rise Slowly

Yesterday, due to the weekend, speculators entered the market, and the situation gradually improved. The opening price was 2,158,000 yuan. During the opening session, there was a struggle around 2,160,000 yuan. Ultimately, the central bank supplied gold, and prices briefly fell to 2,150,000 yuan. After 10:00 AM, the central bank allocated 40 bars at a price of 2,155,000 yuan. Subsequently, buyers became more active. As the audit neared completion, sentiment stabilized, and prices gradually rebounded. Due to the weekend, the US dollar also showed signs of recovery. As a result, buyers were more enthusiastic. Near noon, the price rose to 2,185,000 yuan. Despite the high price, gold was still available. At noon, prices fell back to 2,170,000 yuan. There was little trading in the afternoon. Spot transactions rose slightly to over 2,180,000 yuan. Gold jewelry was listed at 230,000 yuan. Silver bullion and silver dollars were stable. Underground interest rates remained between 1.3 and 1.8 jiao.

All foreign exchange rates rose slightly. Although there were no transactions in US dollars, the British pound rose from 12,800 yuan to over 13,000 yuan. Indian rupees were initially sold at 960 yuan in the morning, but later, there was demand but no supply at 970 yuan. Due to the reduction of telegrams, the Hong Kong dollar fell to 126.5 yuan. It initially jumped to 795 yuan in the morning. At noon, it closed with a buying price of 800 yuan. Due to the weekend, sellers were scarce, and speculators were hesitant to take action, contributing to this situation. The US dollar was initially flat and then strengthened. After opening around 3,950 yuan in the morning, it retreated from 3,970 yuan to 3,920 yuan. After 10:00 AM, buying interest gradually increased. The morning session reached a high of 4,030 yuan, and prices were slightly flat at noon. Buyers remained enthusiastic in the afternoon, pushing prices close to 4,050 yuan. The final result was an increase of 90 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollar bills were also boosted, with transactions occurring between 780 yuan and 800 yuan, a gain of 15 yuan.

### The Theme of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"

— Tao Xiong

"Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" depicts the corruption of the Qing imperial system, the autocracy of Empress Dowager Cixi, the weakness of Emperor Guangxu, and the despotism, baseness, and shamelessness of Li Lianying. It allows us to see that the loss of sovereignty and national humiliation of China in the last hundred years, as well as the bold aggression of imperialists, were all caused by these three people!

If Emperor Guangxu had not been so weak and had been a decisive person, China would not have been reduced to its current state, and Japanese imperialists would not have dared to have the idea of annexing China.

If Empress Dowager Cixi had not been so autocratic, and had not based everything on personal considerations, but had instead prioritized the nation and its people, allowing Emperor Guangxu to fight Japan, and resolving the matter in Korea, Japan would not have dared to despise China so much! Then, the modern history of China would not be so terrible as it is now!

Although Li Lianying was an eunuch, he relied on the Empress Dowager Cixi's favor, used family law to coerce Emperor Guangxu, and used his power to suppress various ministers. He openly engaged in bribery, collected illegal fees, falsely conveyed imperial edicts, and fabricated victory reports. When the matter was exposed and reported, Emperor Guangxu wanted to execute him as a warning to others, but Empress Dowager Cixi lightly dismissed the matter, preventing it from being mentioned again. This made Li Lianying even more despotic and unscrupulous. Therefore, it became a situation where "peace negotiations originated from the Empress Dowager's intentions, and the eunuch Li Lianying actually manipulated them." If he had been a loyal eunuch, the modern history of China would certainly be different, and it would definitely be better than it is now!

"Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" is a drama, and even more a modern history. It tells us that the autocracy and incompetence of a few people can plunge an entire nation into decline and make the people of the entire country live in pain and shame!

### Lighting and Color

— Wen Quan

Lighting has already become the original mission of illumination. Its new tasks in the theater are: to depict the beautiful rhythm of nature (poetry), to present the artistic conception of the spiritual activities hidden in music, to complete the function of set movement, the appreciation of color, the aesthetic sense of three-dimensionality, and the physical balance. It also has to create the flow of the whole play's atmosphere and the brewing of character transformation. It is a soul work of great difficulty. No wonder Adolphe Appia said: Light is the life of the modern stage. Terence Gray said: One-third of the drama's expression depends on the vivid use of light to achieve it.

The shape and color of all objects are known by the reflection of the objects. Especially color, it can express its own color because it leaves the color it cannot absorb, and then reflects it. To put it more concretely, for example, when white light is projected onto a leaf, the leaf absorbs the other six pigments in the white light and reflects the green color that it cannot absorb, thus becoming green. Similarly, a blue film absorbs the six pigments in white light other than blue, so the white light passing through this film becomes blue. This is the simplest color property. In addition, the combination of light color and dyeing will produce a third mixed color (as previously discussed in a special topic). This is the main reason why lighting is taking a new artistic stage. If this main reason cannot exert more diverse and changeable wisdom, the artistic value of lighting will return to destruction.

To express the three-dimensional and architectural movement of the drama, the first thing to pay attention to is its light source. The light in nature is the most perfect color light to express three-dimensionality. But the desire of art is often to surpass nature. So, in addition to the reasonable light and shadow of the object, we ask it to lengthen or shorten, and we ask that certain light and shadows be dyed with complementary colors. Here I would like to give a great ideal: in the scene of the "Macbeth" magic cave, when those witches are frying bloody things in front of the red fire, several dark green (the complementary color of red) giant magic shadows are reflected on the background of the dark ocher giant claw-like leaves, how moving this picture should be. All lighting art expresses the atmosphere, mood, and even the artistic conception of the soul, the movement of the scenery, etc.

In addition to the most basic imitation of nature or the changing color of the set, the use of color light should further complete the three-dimensional and external physical force and the impact of the inner dramatic force by projecting shadows. It should also be able to be like the finishing touch. Unify the form and color of the drama with powerful color touches, and create the spirituality of the drama. Those active modeling, spatial perspective, vivid illusion, and harmony of the picture are just the intuition of junior apprentices, and are not worth mentioning as the end point.

Drama is composed of the encounters of countless living things picked from the living world. The souls, emotions, and experiences of actors with life travel personally through the encounters of the characters, and cooperate with the stage technicians to complete the dramatic art created in the script. For actors, creating living art with living people is of course easier than creating living art with inanimate scenery and lighting. Conversely, it is precisely because it is difficult that its artistic value is increased. Apia discovered the hypnotic effect of lighting in Wagner's music dramas, so he used all the knowledge in color (the hint and symbolic power of color hue and brightness) to make all the backgrounds, such as forests and rocks, move in harmony with the action. This was a surprising discovery at first, but now it has become inevitable knowledge. We know that when the sun sets and the afterglow fills the sky, it will give us a slow and pleasant flow. Another example is a black night. After a flash of lightning, it will give us an uneasy and trembling feeling. Isn't this power given by color light? In addition, in hypnotism, making people stare at a rotating and bright light disk will gradually lose rational activity. At this time, he will let us pour anything into his brain, and he will honestly trust it, and follow the joy, anger, sorrow, and joy of the plot to complete the educational function of the drama.

Light is the mother of color, and color is the element of light. This element has had its urgent, stable value and emotion in human history. If you want to directly hit the audience's senses, avoid the audience's prejudices and psychological processes, color light is more powerful than white light. It is easier to arouse people's anger and easier to break into the highest artistic realm.

### Life and Art

— Gao Heng

Life is the cradle of art!

Life is the treasure house of artists!

Artists must deeply excavate this treasure house. In this way, his works of art will be vivid and real; his artistic life will be able to progress and achieve success; drama is a synthesis of art, that is, the architectural expression in art. In other words, it is the most powerful and sharp link in art.

A poem sings the heart's song of the world, an essay expresses the injustice of society, a novel tells the twists and turns of the world, a piece of music plays the lament of mankind, a painting depicts the ugliness of the universe, and a scene of drama must bring the spirit of poetry, essays, novels, music, and paintings to the stage, and give praise and criticism to the grief, injustice, ugliness, truth, kindness, and beauty between human society. This is the confluence of art! It is also the torrent of life!

What is expressed in drama is nothing more than war, love..., these are all aspects of human life. Life is a struggle. Under the conditions of each person's pursuit of survival, various struggles occur. You have to struggle with love, struggle with war, struggle with money, struggle with bread, struggle with cold, struggle with desire, struggle with others, and also struggle with your own inner self. This is man! This is human life! This is the various forms of life! It is also the various aspects expressed in art!

Therefore, an artist, especially a dramatic artist, must go deep into all levels and corners of human beings, observe, experience, analyze, and study from various different angles, and then use your correct thoughts and passionate emotions to reflect on your art. In this way, your art can truly achieve "the reflection of life."

If you want to be a dramatic artist, you must go to the bustling streets, the desolate countryside; high-rise buildings, thatched huts, the mansions of the rich, the residences of the poor; the delicate pavilions of young ladies, the corners of beggars' walls; you even have to go to the gambling dens where you call out numbers and shout, and take a look at the brothels where colors are unshielded. You also have to make friends with doctors and lawyers, and you also have to chat with fortune tellers and character testers... This is life! This is knowledge! This is the material of drama! This is the nourishment of dramatists! You must firmly grasp it! You must firmly embrace it!

This is not enough, you must live with them in this crowd, breathe their breath, experience their pain, understand their thoughts, exchange their emotions, go deep into the depths of their souls, love what they love, hate what they hate, enjoy their joy, and grieve their sorrow; only in this way can you be in tune with them, understand them thoroughly; however, you must also carefully pay attention to appropriately control your emotions and reason.

A dramatist cannot be a patient, he should be like a brilliant doctor. He diagnoses the diseases of society, understands the suffering of the people, prescribes the right medicine for the disease, and publishes his diagnosis report to mankind. Only in this way can he prevent the spread of diseases and restore the health of patients, and human society can benefit practically.

Therefore, you must improve your life, enrich your life, go deep into the hearts and minds of the people, and bravely go to the furnace of life. This is an inexhaustible treasure!

Dramatists, you must first live in the hearts of the people, and then the people will live in your art.

### The Poplars in the Tale of the Holy City

### Characters in "Of Mice and Men"

— Wu Yonggang

Xia Zhibing, Ying Shijie, and Li Ruolan are classmates and close friends. Zhibing and Shijie both love Ruolan. Ruolan is Zhibing's cousin who grew up with him. The memories of childhood life make Zhibing deeply love Ruolan, but also deepen his pain, because he has a contradictory character; he is brave and upright like Don Quixote, and hesitant and hesitant like Hamlet. He grieves for his poverty and arrogant personality, and also compares his poverty and arrogant personality to Cyrano's big nose, because the big nose is a burden on Cyrano's love, so he also hides his love in his heart, letting Shijie gain Ruolan's love, but he can't get rid of his contradictory, tangled mood, and has the sadness common to young intellectuals from the petty bourgeoisie.

Shijie is a contrasting character. He has a noble family background, handsome appearance, and cheerful personality. He dares to say and do anything, and only seeks to achieve his goals by any means, even to the point of building his own happiness on the pain of others.

Ruolan is an innocent girl who enjoys everyone's love for her. In her heart, she doesn't know what sorrows there are in the world.

The three of them played the Western classic play "Cyrano de Bergerac" together at school. Zhibing played Cyrano de Bergerac, Ruolan played Roxane, and Zhibing also announced the news of Shijie and Ruolan's engagement. This made his own heart even sadder and more painful. Finally, an inspiration freed him from the pain of love. He wanted to do a little bit of human responsibility and do a little bit of human work. He believed that if the Chinese nation could not be liberated from imperialism, there would never be a chance for free survival. He missed his hometown in the Northeast, which had fallen under the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism. So, he must do something for his hometown, must fight against rat-like people, and even eliminate them! But in the end, he still guarded Ruolan, and both heroically sacrificed for the nation!

Spring and Autumn

### Viewing the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting from Past Dynasties

— Dingshan

Among Pang Xuzhai's exhibits, Ni Yunlin's "Yuan Hui Du Shi" scroll is the highlight, and also the highlight of the entire exhibition. He Shizun's cat and rock painting is dated to the Song dynasty. Dai Jin's imitation of Yan Wengui's landscape is also exquisite. If Li Cheng and Guo Xi are concerned, the old collector has many fine pieces hidden away, and he shows people Ye Gong's dragon instead. Why?

Wang Zhongming is the mainstay of the exhibition's initiators. His family has Huang Zijiu's "Nine Peaks and Clouds," which is enough to be the crown of the Yuan Four Masters, but he keeps it hidden. He only exhibited Ma Wenbi's "Poetic Scene of Muyun," Yao Shou's "Bamboo and Birds," Wen Zhengming's "Preserving Chrysanthemums," and Hua Qiuyue's "Willow and Swallows" - three paintings, leaving people with a sense of incompleteness. However, they are all fine pieces.

Zhang Congyu has a rich collection and exhibited a lot of pieces. Chu Mu's "Guan Ting" with Mi Yuanzhang's inscription can be considered a superb original work. Wu Zhonggui's "Bamboo and Stone," Chen Qiushui's landscape made for Yan Sizhai, and Ma Wenbi's "Spring Water Building Boats" are all fine works by Yuan artists. However, Ni Yunlin's works are not exhibited outside of Yu Shan's Lin Yu, causing Pang Xuzhai's "Yuan Hui Du Shi" to stand alone and dominate the time. Is it that Congyu treasures this divine piece so much that he does not want to easily show it to others?

Wu Hufan exhibited Shi Tao's "Panoramic View of the Yangtze River" scroll, a monumental work.

Wang Nanping's collection of Mi Youren's "Xiao Xiang Wonderful Views" and Zhou Xiangyun's old collection are equally outstanding. Among Mi's cloud mountains seen in the world, these are likely the only ones. Although both scrolls are damaged, Wang's scroll is better. Zhou's scroll can still be exquisitely repaired. If a good restorer can be found, it will surely shine brightly. Does Nanping have intentions regarding Mi's meritorious deeds?

Feng Chaoran has Fan Kuan's "Northern Peak Gang," Tan Hechang has Ma Yuan's "Treading Song Picture," Wu Hufan has Zhao Boju's "Immortal Mountain Pavilion," and Zhang Congyu has Zhao Yong's "Autumn Stream Quiet Fishing." These are the true dragon and elephant among the Song paintings in this exhibition.

Wu Ziyie has Gu Dingzhi's "Ink Bamboo" scroll, which is the most scholarly of Gu's bamboo paintings. It is a pity that there are official seals everywhere, all from the hands of painting merchants. He also exhibited Dong Qichang's landscape scroll, which is also a good collaboration.

Ding Huikang has Ma Yuan's "Treading Snow to Seek Plums," which is also a genuine piece, but inferior to "Treading Song Picture." He also has Shi Xi's "Green Mountain Piercing Clouds" scroll, which he recently acquired for 2.4 million, making it a divine work of Shi Xi.

The Four Wangs and Wu Yun occupy the most space. Yanke considers his own "Lu Xiang Shu Tang" scroll to be a masterpiece. Lianzhou's Xu Bangyuan scroll is both exquisite and long. For Shigu, there is my imitation of the landscape of Meihua Temple, and Wang Jiqian's "Mountain Residence Talking About Taoism." For Nongtai, there is my imitation of Ni Gaoshi's landscape, and Pang Xuzhai's "Four Wonders of Landscape." For Yushan, there is Pang Xuzhai's "Lake and Sky Spring Colors" and Wang Nanping's "Wellside Summer." For Nantian, there is my "Withered Tree and Bamboo Stone" and Xiang Shu Tang's "Fish Algae."

### Kim Dong-xin's Self-Portrait

— Zhou Shushan

The inscriptions on paintings by the Qing dynasty artist Kim Dong-xin have long been treasured by the world, and he wrote quite a few inscriptions for self-portraits as well. Now, I have again seen one of his self-portraits from when he was seventy-three years old. It was originally painted as a gift for his friend Ding Gan-shen, and was later included in the "Collection of Famous Figures" by the Xiling Seal Art Society. Both the inscription and the painting are truly precious items.

This self-portrait depicts him with a beautiful beard and thick neck, without a hat and wearing loose clothing, a short braid hanging down his back, and leaning on a walking stick. His eyes look forward, as if he is walking slowly, and the length of the stick exceeds half his height, resembling a fishing rod. The portrait is both unrestrained and detached, resembling a wild old man. The painting is even more simple, ancient, and lush, brimming with untamed interest. It truly does not disgrace the name of a master. I have also seen the first page of the "Dongxin Guang Sheng Collection," which also features a print of another portrait of him in his later years, similar to this self-portrait at age seventy-three, but it was later re-painted by Ding Wen-wei based on a painting by Ren Wei-chang. Furthermore, Gao Xiang (also known as Xi Tang), one of the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou," painted a portrait of him at the age of forty-seven, which is also considered a masterpiece.

Kim Dong-xin's given name was Nong, his courtesy name was Shoumen. He was a native of Qiantang during the Qing dynasty. In the early years of the Qianlong era, he was recommended for the Hongbo Examination but did not take it. Instead, he made a living through poetry, literature, calligraphy, and painting in Yangzhou, and thus became one of the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou." He authored the "Dongxin Collection," and his miscellaneous writings are also numerous. Regarding the inscription on this self-portrait, he wrote:

"In painting a likeness with a single dab of rice, during the Jin dynasty there was Gu Kaizhi, who painted Pei Kai, and during the Southern Qi dynasty there was Xie He, who captured the spirit of Pu Su. During the Tang dynasty, Wang Wei painted a portrait of Meng Haoran at the Prefectural Governor's pavilion, and during the Song dynasty, Zhi Wang painted a portrait of Zhang Jiuling, Zhu Bao-yi painted a portrait of Zhang Guo, Li Fang painted a portrait of the Layman of Fragrant Mountain, Song Lin Shao-yun painted a portrait of Mr. Xijia on the road to Mount Hua, Li Shi-huo painted a portrait of the Old Man of Banshan riding a donkey, He Chong painted a portrait of the Layman Su Dongpo, and Zhang Datong painted a small portrait of the Old Man of Shangu on Mount Mowei. These are all masterpieces of portraiture. However, there has never been anyone who painted a portrait of himself, except as recorded in the 'Yunji Qiqian,' that during the Da Zhong era of the Tang dynasty, a Daoist priest named Wu used a mirror and brush to paint his own likeness. Therefore, I have used the ink wash white drawing method to paint a portrait of myself, an old man of three dynasties, at the age of seventy-three. I have painted the folds of the clothing and the features of the face with a single brush stroke, with Lu Tanwei as my model. After the painting is completed, I will send it far away to my old friend Ding Dun-ding in my hometown, a recluse. Recluse, you have not seen me for nearly five years. Can you not miss me? One day, when I return to the Jiang River, I will join you, staff in hand, reciting poetry and competing in wit, proving that my aging appearance has not lost its mountain forest air. Inscribed by Kim Nong on the day of the Beginning of Autumn in the intercalary sixth month of the twenty-fourth year of Qianlong, at the Nine-Joint Sweet Flag Studio of the monk Zeng Zhi in Guangling."

At this time, this old man was already past seventy years old, yet he was still residing at a monk's assembly in Yangzhou. One can imagine his tranquil and lofty sentiments. However, he could not forget his own aging, and often thought of his hometown and his old friends. This is probably a common human emotion. On the left corner of the painting is a small square seal that reads "Seal of Ding Jingshen," indicating his collection. However, I do not know if the original still exists in the world today.

The style of Mr. Dongxin can generally be seen in his poetry, literature, calligraphy, and painting, and the abundance of his talent can also be seen in these. He was truly skilled in seal script calligraphy, and his works in his later years reached the same state of simplicity as his paintings, and therefore both were treasured by others.

### Picture of Spring Scenery on Lakes and Sky (Collected by [Name])

### The Trend of Collecting in Shanghai

— Pan Boying

Today in Shanghai, there is a laughable and dangerous trend among those who collect ancient calligraphy and paintings. This bad trend is to not collect silk paintings, but only paper paintings, and to want "fresh and spicy" paper paintings. The so-called "fresh and spicy" means that the paintings have been carefully preserved and circulated, and although they are old paintings, they feel like new to the touch, so new that it is intense.

There is no need to talk about the fact that most paintings from the Tang and Five Dynasties periods are silk paintings. Even when it comes to Song and Yuan paintings, almost all of Emperor Huizong of Song's paintings that have been passed down are silk paintings. Wang Jinqing used silk when imitating ancient works, but used paper for original compositions (in today's terms, creations of his own). Zhao Ziang and Qian Shunju both used silk and paper together. Only after Huang Heshanqiao and Ni Yunlin did paper paintings become more common. However, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, due to advances in technology, the silk became even finer. Many painters from these two dynasties used silk. People in the Ming Dynasty even expanded the use of silk fabrics. In addition to silk, they also liked to use silk twill. Wu Meicun once described the pleasure of writing on silk twill in his poems. Therefore, among the masterpieces that have been passed down from ancient times, silk paintings account for half. If we follow the standard of Shanghai collectors who admire paper paintings today, wouldn't we be abandoning half of the famous works of calligraphy and painting out of thin air?

We admit that paper paintings have a longer lifespan than silk paintings, and paper paintings are easier to collect and open (opening a painting and then rolling it up is not something that an inexperienced person can do. If it is not done well, it will damage the painting). Both are less likely to be damaged than silk paintings. This may be the reason why Shanghai collectors want to collect paper paintings today. However, I believe that this is precisely the reason why we should not not collect silk paintings. My friend Xie Zhiliu once made a wonderful analogy for the difference between silk and paper. Zhiliu said that silk and paper are like a pair of sons in calligraphy and painting. The silk son is weak, and the paper son is strong. A strong son is of course much better. But there are also many good weak sons. I have never heard of a good son being kicked out of the house because he is weak. This analogy is extremely clear. I believe that precisely because silk paintings are not easy to preserve and famous works are being damaged day by day, collectors should make an extra effort to seek out fine silk paintings and preserve them carefully, in order to remedy the inherent defects of silk paintings. If we push the boat along with the tide and refrain from collecting them together, then the fate of silk paintings will be even more dire.

We infer that Shanghai collectors are tending towards paper paintings, and are all tending towards "fresh and spicy" paper paintings, and we cannot help but have a pessimistic explanation for this mentality. These collectors are not collecting for the sake of collecting, but for the sake of making money. Their collection of calligraphy and paintings is equivalent to hoarding goods. Therefore, they are only willing to spend money on collecting the easiest to sell and the least likely to be damaged. Whether they are true connoisseurs or nouveau riche, they are willing to pay money to buy "fresh and spicy" paper paintings, so the tastes of collectors are tending towards this path. Under the principle that economics determines everything, we also forgive this kind of mentality. However, if this bad mentality becomes a trend today, and it becomes more and more intense, then famous silk paintings will disappear from the world. Now Shanghai is the only center in China where cultural relics are gathered. At a time when the country is scarred and all the arts are lost, this trend in Shanghai will quickly spread to other places. Because Shanghai, which is the richest place, does not collect silk paintings, other places will not collect them either.

Most people who can collect calligraphy and paintings are people who have spare money. Even if they are entrepreneurs or various businessmen, they at least have some interest in calligraphy and painting. Therefore, I would like to advise these people to focus more on their interests. Since you are playing with calligraphy and painting, don't try to make money from calligraphy and painting anymore. The elegance of some salt merchants in the past has been passed down as a joke. But at least they didn't make money from the "elegance" they were playing with. There may not necessarily be a difference between ancient and modern people. Why be laughed at by salt merchants? In this way, the cultural purpose can be achieved incidentally. More silk painting masterpieces can be preserved if they can be collected together. (At the same time, you will definitely not lose money). If not, there will inevitably be outstanding artists among the descendants of these collectors in the future. If they want to find a few silk paintings, they will not know that they have long been destroyed by their fathers and grandfathers!

Therefore, we say very sadly that this is a laughable and dangerous trend.

However, we still believe that there are still many true connoisseurs in Shanghai. They will definitely not discriminate between silk and paper when collecting calligraphy and paintings. They will definitely put their interest in appreciation and their cultural purpose before their "business eye." At the same time, the senior elders of society and the backbone of culture and education will definitely be able to fulfill their leadership responsibilities. If we can prevent this trend from getting worse, and gradually promote it to a path of active development, that would be good.

When the social atmosphere is going downhill, it is always unpleasant to hear someone say something unpleasant. The trend of collecting should also be like this. However, this matter is too important, and there are too few people willing to say such things now, so I dare to make an appeal. Whether you know I am guilty or not, I can only leave it to Hongda's understanding.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 47

— Ye Jingfeng

After returning to the station from Ding Yuan, I received a message from Mr. W saying that Song Zheyuan had officially ordered the entire 29th Army to mobilize for war. (This order, if it had been issued twenty days earlier, or even ten days, or five days earlier, would have been much more certain. Although it would not have been possible to drive all the Japanese invaders out of the country, at least it could have given them a fatal blow.) In the midst of my busy schedule, I mentioned Ding Yuan's matter to Mr. W again. Mr. W said, "It's best to ask him to go to Beiping first. Several senior generals of the 29th Army are here," and said that he could definitely be responsible for the introduction. I also explained Ding Yuan's illness and his request, and asked if he could introduce him to Zhang Zizhong, Feng Zhian, or any division commander, and just issue an appointment order. Mr. W said, "Try to handle it as soon as possible. I will let you know as soon as I have news." I immediately wrote a note with this message and sent it to Ding Yuan.

Before midnight, there were occasionally one or two cannon shots and a few sporadic machine gun sounds. After twelve o'clock, it was completely quiet, so quiet that it was a little unsettling. Because I was very busy with intelligence work these two days, and I also had to arrange for my men to scout the nearby areas, I could only rest in pieces, so I was exhausted. Perhaps because of excessive fatigue, and because the atmospheric pressure was very low, it was a bit stuffy. At the same time, I was still thinking about the war situation and Ding Yuan's matter, so I tossed and turned on the sleeping platform. I had just fallen asleep with great difficulty, but was suddenly awakened by a loud bang. It sounded like a very large shell had exploded, and even the earthen bed jumped. Number 04 was in the room at this time, waiting for news. Seeing that I had been awakened by the loud noise, he quickly said, "It's okay. The Japanese have been firing for five minutes. It must be a shell exploding... But it's very close to here." As he was saying this, someone came in from outside to report: "A bomb has fallen under Tushan Ridge, near the corner of the power plant."

"A bomb?" I was still a little drowsy. "Why didn't I hear a plane?"

"There was one, but it's already far away... Very high altitude."

I was very surprised. According to Japanese intelligence, they were clearly saying that they would attack at dawn on the 28th. Why did it start in the middle of the night? Maybe the plan has changed? Who knew that when I looked at the clock, it was already 5:07. Because the sky was cloudy, it wasn't as bright as usual. Only then did I realize that although I felt like I had only dozed off for a short while, I had already slept for more than four hours.

At this time, the artillery fire, light and heavy machine guns, and rifles on both sides in the Wanping area were ten times more intense than before. This was because the Japanese had repeatedly provoked in the past, and our side had only responded slightly because they had not received orders from the commander. This time, however, there was a clear order to resist the war, so of course they attacked with all their might. Although the Japanese had dispatched planes to assist in the battle, and there were also tanks charging on the ground, they were no match for the anger that our army had been holding back for more than twenty days. Once it was vented, it was incomparably fierce.

From the start of the war at five o'clock to six o'clock, the radio constantly broadcast good news. The three external affairs officers that we had sent out also returned one after another to report that our side was winning in the Wanping area. At 6:30, Beiping Radio, based on battlefield telephone calls, confirmed that our side had recovered Fengtai, Chenjiazhuang, Huangtupo, and other places. At seven o'clock, our army in Nanyuan captured two Japanese tanks, and suicide squads used explosives to destroy several Japanese giant tanks, curbing the enemy's momentum of charging and breaking through the lines. At 9:30, Zhang Zizhong's troops recovered Langfang, shot down a Japanese plane, intercepted three tanks outside Tongzhou, destroyed two, and killed hundreds of enemies.

Based on the secret intelligence I had gathered over the past ten days or so, I was extremely clear about the strength and formations of both the enemy and our side. I knew that once the great war started, our army would definitely be unable to stop the enemy's advance, because the comparison of numbers was ten to two against us; the comparison of military equipment was that the enemy's was new and ours was old, and we lacked everything. Not to mention airplanes and tanks, our side had nothing, and we even lacked anti-aircraft guns and mortars to resist airplanes and tanks. The only weapon we had to resist the enemy was a sense of justice that was carried out in one breath. This sense of justice could also be said to be a sense of grief and indignation at the enemy's unprovoked invasion, or it could be said to be a spirit of righteousness to protect the motherland and not allow the mountains and rivers to fall under the hooves of beasts. In any case, I knew that the war situation would not last long.

### Backdoor Transactions

— Shaofu

I have discussed the recent surge in the price of US dollars, believing that it was entirely caused by speculation. Sure enough, according to the results of an investigation by a reporter from this newspaper yesterday, Li Lixia, director of the Financial Institutions Inspection Department of the Central Bank, stated that the daily business figures reported by some money shops engaged in foreign currency trading differed greatly from the daily exchange volume of each shop at the clearing house. Among them, the Santai and Yuxing money shops are the most suspected. The Central Bank has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate, and if the circumstances are serious, they will be dealt with according to the law.

We believe that this thorough investigation will definitely uncover serious circumstances.

Speculation is already commonplace. There are many such things in Shanghai, both large and small. But what is strange is that the Santai money shop involved in this case is the protagonist in the Central Bank gold case three months ago. It has already been suspended from business. Although the front door has been sealed, it is engaged in backdoor transactions. There are dozens of telephones for talking about business. It has reached such a scale, and the trading activities have been going on for more than a day. Why was it only discovered that it was engaged in backdoor transactions until this time when the price of US dollars surged? This is really puzzling.

It is too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost, but if it is not mended again, it is inevitable that more sheep will escape. We hope that the authorities will get to the root of the problem and thoroughly investigate this time. Otherwise, maybe gold or rice will experience another big turnaround in a week or two.

### Hardoon Garden to be Converted into a Park

— Zhengfan

"The central district needs a park!" This slogan has been shouted for a long time. Because of the racecourse problem, many people advocate converting it into a park, and this slogan has been shouted even more vigorously. This can't help but make people think of the "Great View Garden on the Sea" famous throughout the country - Hardoon Garden. It occupies three hundred mu of land in the central district, and the garden gate is closed all year round, allowing the pavilions and towers in the garden to gradually collapse and the vegetation to become overgrown. This is really too "wasteful" and "selfish." The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has negotiated with the person in charge of the garden several times to rent it and open it as a park for citizens to play in. It is said that the heirs of Hardoon have expressed their strong approval. After the renovation is completed, it can be opened. In this way, residents in the central district can obtain an excellent place for recreation, and Hardoon Garden will also lose its "mystery."

The reason why Hardoon Garden is called the "Great View Garden on the Sea" is of course due to the beauty of the pavilions, towers, ponds, and rocks. Because it has always refused to open to the public, the situation in the garden is not well known to outsiders. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the rebel Wang Yitang lived in the garden and wrote an article "Record of Ailiyuan," which described it in great detail, such as the Begonia Boat, the Zhilan Studio, the Huangnie Mountain House, the Jiyeting Pavilion, the Tingfeng Pavilion, the Willow Bay, the Xuwu Bridge, the Guanyuting Pavilion, the Menbiting Pavilion, the Dieyin Corridor, the Donggui Xuan, the Shipiao, the Kunlunyuan, the Yinquan, the Jiusi Hall, the Xiaoyingzhou, the Yucui Pavilion, the Beidongtian, the Shiping Terrace, the Jiangxue Sea, and the Hongmiao Village... There are as many as hundreds of such names, making people feel even more eager to take a look as soon as possible. At the end of the text, Wang rebel wrote: "The garden owner is very hospitable, and guests feel at home. The famous gardens and scenic spots, the fish and birds are friendly to people, and it is not a small help to take a break from hard work." It is all written with a bit of smugness.

Hardoon Garden, in the historical sense, is closely related to the prosperity of Shanghai. When the Jewish Hardoon roamed to Shanghai, Shanghai was not yet the "Ten Mile Foreign Concession." Due to the昏庸 corruption of the Manchu Qing government, various countries bought land and opened concessions, and the market gradually prospered, and Hardoon's real estate business made a lot of money. Half of the tall buildings on Nanjing Road are Hardoon's property: Hardoon Building, Jialu Building, Cishu Building, and countless "Ci" and "Ni" character head lilong buildings are all. After making money, I naturally wanted to enjoy the blessings, so I hired many experts, spent a lot of effort, spent millions of dollars, and spent three years to complete this Hardoon Garden.

There are Hidden Affairs in the Garden

The strange stories and romantic scraps in Hardoon Garden have always been the focus of attention of Shanghai people. A certain celebrity collected the hidden affairs in the garden and compiled a novel for publication. Later, the book was bought up and out of print. In short, the situation is like Jiao Da's criticism of the Rongguo Mansion in Dream of the Red Chamber.

In the early years of the Republic of China, a university was actually run in the garden, with a strange name - "Huisheng Mingzhi University." It recruited male and female students, and all the expenses for the students were provided by the garden. However, the school spirit was stubborn and old-fashioned, the school rules were extremely strict, and those who entered the school had to follow the rules on time and be vegetarians for a year. Most of the students were forced to run away by climbing over the wall. Soon after, the students rose up in opposition, launching a student movement, and the school was disbanded. Later, the so-called "Huayan Fire School" was established, which was purely monastic education.

Hardoon's wife, Madam Luo Jialing, was a devout Buddhist, so she built a nunnery in Ailiyuan to worship Buddha, just like a temple. She also adopted many monks and nuns, and the "bald heads" were all over the place, as if there was another world. Luo Jialing herself did not have any children, but she loved to adopt adopted sons and daughters. The male and female high-achieving students of that "Cangsheng Mingzhi University" were often asked to kneel before her, and there were no less than a hundred people in total. After Luo Jialing's "driving back to Penglai," the adopted children fought over the inheritance, and the lawsuits were endless.

I Hope It Will Be Realized Soon

Getting back to the main topic: The suggestion to turn Hardoon Garden into a park was made after Madam Luo Jialing's death in the 30th year of the Republic of China (before that, no one dared to make the suggestion, and it was useless to make the suggestion). The English-language Continental Daily specially wrote an editorial "Making Hardoon Garden a Park," suggesting that the "Shanghai Municipal Council" take immediate action to acquire the property for use as a park, and suggested that investment be made to issue bonds to fund the purchase. Unfortunately, there was no sound or smell of it later. Some people also advocated opening a commercial field in Hardoon Garden, and the proceeds would be used for relief work, but there was no follow-up.

Now that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has a plan to convert Hardoon Garden into a park, the opening of this "Great View Garden on the Sea" is no problem. We urgently wish in advance that this private enjoyment den will soon be transformed into a public paradise for millions of citizens!

### Soul, Come Back!

— Deyun

When I was a child, I was often frightened and became ill, which troubled my mother, who would "call back my soul" for me at night. I remember, I remember deeply: this is great maternal love.

But I believe that at that time, I did not lose anything. But today, whenever I search my heart in the middle of the night, I begin to believe: I have indeed lost my kind soul.

Indeed, years of social life have merged me into the dirty currents of the sea of people. Oh, God, where has my beautiful and pure soul gone?

I want to light a stick of incense in this autumn night, like my mother did. I want to sincerely and silently pray that the pure soul that was forced to be lost will return to my heart!

### Desire

— A

The simplification of spiritual desires allows a person to have a lifelong sustenance and a destination for life; but the intricate complexity of material desires is an eternal source of pain.

### Three Days of American Life

— Cheng Zhi

For a year, American goods have flooded the market. Whether it is food, supplies, or clothing, they are all strange and beautiful, making people envious and lovable. Although they are cheap and good, a poor boy like me would not dare to have such extravagant thoughts. But being able to stroll down the road and visit companies, taking the opportunity to look at the various luxurious and magnificent American equipment in the windows, is already quite satisfying.

This time, thanks to the blessing of the American army and the generosity of the Materials Supply Bureau, I was able to get three days' worth of surplus food from the American army at a low price for public and religious personnel. Although I felt that 9,000 yuan was still a pain, I thought that this would not only allow me to taste the American flavor, but also to enjoy three days of American life. Why not do it? So I paid the money generously and waited for the arrival of the day of distribution.

The day before yesterday morning, I received nine bags of things from the distribution point. I was very happy. Moreover, it is said that this batch is still from 1945, so the mildew situation that was rumored would certainly not happen.

A Variety of Things

At 12:00 noon, I started my three days of American life. I carefully opened a bag labeled "D" from the drawer and carefully took out the things inside one by one, carefully observing them. Of course, there were many colors, including biscuits, cheese, lemon powder, sugar cubes, cigarettes, matches, candy, gummy bears, and coffee candy. So I spread the cheese on the biscuits and ate them, then had a big spoonful of coffee candy, then a glass of lemonade, and a cigarette. After work started in the afternoon, I could still eat some candy in my spare time. Although I felt a little sweet and greasy, I was quite satisfied.

Not Very Comfortable

For dinner, the first course was beef soup made with powder and biscuits, followed by canned meatloaf, and finally chocolate candy and gummy bears. This stuff was too sweet and I was not interested, but I still forced myself to finish it. After dinner, I started reading as usual. But it seemed that not long after, my stomach was singing the empty city plan. The amount of food I ate today was of course less than usual, but the aspects were much better. I also opened a book about human nutrition and checked it. Of course, it was not bad. These foods were all complete with vitamin A, B, C, D, fat, carbohydrates, sugars, proteins, etc. This must have been designed by American nutrition experts. As long as the nutrition is sufficient, it doesn't matter if there is less food. Moreover, experts from various countries have always thought that Chinese people eat too much. After considering this, I went to bed calmly, but my stomach was rumbling and I couldn't sleep.

I got up at dawn the next morning. After washing up, I immediately started breakfast. The ham and eggs were not bad, but the rest was biscuits, candy, and other things that I hated. I could still force myself to eat the biscuits because I was hungry, but I could only politely decline the candy. Today, I don't know if it was because I was not in good spirits, but the work that I usually did without any effort seemed to be troublesome now.

No Blessing to Enjoy

Today's interest was far less than yesterday's. When I found out that the bag still had the same things as yesterday, I was even more unhappy. However, when I saw my colleagues cheering and celebrating, I was embarrassed to say that it was not delicious, and I was even more afraid that they would laugh at me for not being blessed to enjoy it. So I had to reluctantly do it, pretending to be very happy and eating the things. During the day, I felt nauseous and wanted to vomit, and there was an indescribable discomfort in my stomach!

The colleague sitting across from me saw that I was listless and, out of kindness, asked for leave for me and sent me back to the dormitory to rest.

When I woke up, the moon was already hanging on the willow branches. I thought to myself that I had not eaten yet, so I had to get out of bed and stagger to the desk, intending to open the box for supper. My eyes stared blankly at the biscuits and candy, and I had no appetite at all. Suddenly, I rushed downstairs and gave all the bags of things to the handyman Jin Gen. In his constant thanks, I had already stepped into a small noodle shop outside the dormitory, and a bowl of plain noodles immediately made me feel much better.

At this point, I was deeply convinced that I was an ordinary person who was not blessed to enjoy American life, and that I was not qualified to talk about vitamins, fats, and proteins.

### Amusing Anecdotes of Ma Zhanshan

— Jinxia

Someone Claims to Be General Ma's Father

Yesterday, this newspaper's "News Personalities" discussed Ma Zhanshan. Here is an additional piece of historical material to supplement the account.

In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China [1936], the general encountered an amusing incident that, like his fame, caused a sensation throughout the country:

Beyond All Reason

It turns out that after General Ma returned from the Northeast at that time, he resided in the British Concession of Tianjin at No. 46 Road, living a secluded life, uninterested in worldly affairs. Suddenly, in July of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China [1935], an old man named Ma Rong from Fengrun came to Tianjin and petitioned the court, requesting confirmation that General Ma Zhanshan was his lost son. Because of improper jurisdiction (the plaintiff was from Fengrun and should have first petitioned the local court), the prosecutor did not accept the case. Unexpectedly, in July of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China [1936], Ma Rong came to Tianjin again, crying and making a scene in front of the General's residence, attempting to forcibly claim General Ma as his son. General Ma, finding that several attempts to dissuade him were ineffective and that reason was useless, filed a lawsuit in the Tianjin District Court's Criminal Division, accusing Ma Rong of defamation. At the same time, he also requested the Civil Division to confirm that there was no father-son relationship with Ma Rong.

Court Investigation

During the court investigation, according to Ma Rong's confession, his son was lost at the age of seven, and he was the same age, same name, same surname, same province, and same county as General Ma. He had two sons in total, the eldest son named Ma Zhanshan, and the younger son named Ma Shoushan. The eldest son had a "tethering post" (i.e., a wart) near his ear, and he requested identification to reunite father and son.

General Ma stated that although his ancestral home was Fengrun, Hebei, his family had lived in Huaide County, Liaoning Province, for generations. His biological father, Ma Chun, died of illness in Huaide on September 26 of the sixth year of the Republic of China [1917]. Zhang Dianjiu and Bao Tailai, who assisted with the funeral on that day, were called to court to testify. Furthermore, the General was born in the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign [1885], while Ma Rong's lost son's birthday was the eighth day of the twelfth month of the tenth year of the Guangxu reign [1884]. The court further ordered a forensic examination, which confirmed that the General had no "tethering post" near his ear.

Blood Drop Identification

Ma Rong requested "blood drop identification," but the judge believed that it was not in accordance with the law. According to modern medicine, blood drops are not sufficient to prove a blood relationship.

The court ruled: "There is no father-son relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant." The amusing drama that spread throughout the country came to an end.
