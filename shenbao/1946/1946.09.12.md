Although the Ping-Gu section has not been opened, the Pinggu District Railway Bureau has prepared materials and plans to begin surveying work on the 15th. According to railway bureau personnel, although this section is light rail, it is also standard gauge, so it will not affect future joint transportation with other railways. Furthermore, in order to prevent the National Army from resupplying, the Communist army destroyed two sections of the bridge between Zhangxin and Shunyi on the Ping-Gu line with landmines at 1:00 AM this morning.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 10th] The National Army recovered strongholds such as Langhushan and Dingjunshan in the suburbs of Jining City on the afternoon of the 10th, and a portion of the troops broke into the city.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] According to information from relevant agencies here, the situation in Datong continues to improve. Following the recovery of strongholds north of the city, two-thirds of the lost strongholds on the east, west, and south sides have also been recovered.

Rumors of the Communist Army Withdrawing from Harbin and Moving the Headquarters to Jiamusi

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] The Northeast is generally calm, with only conflicts in the Benxi area. However, this silence is unlikely to last, and officials speculate that Lin Biao will launch an offensive to contain the westward movement of the National Army. The Communist side is also publicizing that the National Army is deploying an offensive, claiming that the New Sixth Army has been transferred south to the Liaoyang, Anshan, and Haicheng areas to take action. The 71st Army is gathering in the Liaoyuan and Faku areas, preparing to sweep the western Manchuria. The New First Army is gathering in the Changchun, Yongji, and southern bank of the Songhua River areas, actively repairing the Songhua River railway bridge, preparing to take Harbin to the north.

[United Press, Beiping, 11th] According to an urgent telegram published here today, the Communist army has begun a general retreat from Harbin. According to the North China Daily and the Beiping Daily, Lin Biao, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Communist Army, who has been directing military operations in Harbin for the past few months, has begun to move his headquarters to Jiamusi, 200 miles northeast of Harbin and 75 miles southwest of the Siberian border.

### Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Journalists; The Government Hopes to Restore Peace and Tranquility; If the Chinese Communists Can Sincerely Cooperate, Conflicts Can Be Stopped

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Information Department held a press conference for foreign journalists at 3:00 PM on the 11th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The main questions are recorded below: Question: If the unofficial five-person group reaches an agreement on the number of seats allocated to the National Government Committee, can the government: (1) issue a nationwide ceasefire order, (2) or does the government still insist that the Chinese Communists must withdraw from northern Jiangsu?

Minister Peng replied: Not long ago, the government requested the Chinese Communists to withdraw from northern Jiangsu, the Jiaoji Railway, and other places. At that time, the Chinese Communists requested that the government be reorganized first. Now the government agrees to discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee, and the Chinese Communists are again requesting that the above conditions be lifted first. The government is unwilling to fall into this cycle of contradictions. It is feared that merely issuing an order by the government will not achieve the results expected by the five people. For example, the government has issued orders many times, but has failed to lift the siege of Datong. If the Chinese Communists truly and sincerely cooperate with the government, I believe that conflicts can be stopped. The government does not advocate solving the Chinese Communist problem by force. What the government earnestly hopes for is the restoration of peace and order so that it can devote itself to the construction of the country as soon as possible. Once construction begins, the hungry masses controlled by the Chinese Communists will obtain employment and return to their normal lives. If they lose their tools of disturbance, they will become peaceful citizens. It does not matter if some of them still believe in Marxism or totalitarianism, as these ideas were seen in the writings of various philosophers during the Zhou and Qin dynasties 25 centuries ago, and no one in China fears these old doctrines. Question: What is the current military situation?

Minister Peng replied: There is no change in the Rugao area of northern Jiangsu. In the Suqian area, the National Army has entered east of the Grand Canal. Datong is still in the hands of the National Army. It is reported that Fu Zuoyi's reinforcement army has arrived in Fengzhen. Gubeikou has been recovered, and the Ping-Gu railway will be open to traffic soon.

### Under the Armed Surveillance of the Communist Side, Forcing the Team to Leave Chengde, The American Team Leader Reports on the Evacuation Process

[United Press, Beiping, 11th] Colonel Rozmai, the American team leader of the 11th Executive Team of the Military Mediation Department, told reporters today: The Communist army arrested the 11th Team, forced them to leave Chengde, and traveled along the winding roads of Jehol Province under armed surveillance, during which they were strafed by National Army aircraft. When a Communist army officer ordered the team to leave Chengde, "I stated that I was departing under protest, and I believe that I have been arrested. I had no choice but to depart because I was facing force, and I was only able to depart under armed surveillance." Rozmai's report is completely different from the previous reports on the experiences of the 11th Team. Rozmai also revealed that the four Communist Party members who died in the air raid were not members of the team. Communist Party sources previously reported that the four were members of the team, which is not true. These four were a Communist army truck driver, a cook, and two soldiers. The only team member who died was Staff Sergeant Li Qingfu of the National Army. Rozmai also detailed that after the American Sergeant Hogan was burned, he tried to seek help but was blocked by the Communist army. He stated to the Communist army that he had been ordered by the Military Mediation Department to stay in Chengde, but before he could telegraph the Military Mediation Department, the Communist army forced him to evacuate with them, and "Communist armed soldiers ordered me to shut down the radio." At that time, the National Army was 40 miles from Chengde. He also submitted a written protest to the local Communist army commander, opposing the order to force the team to evacuate. In addition, Colonel Min Shiji, a member of the National Government side of the team, told reporters: "We left the city entirely under armed pressure. Communist armed personnel went to the team's office and forced us to depart. I told the Communist army that they had to issue an arrest warrant before I would leave the city, and the Communist army actually said, 'Okay, we arrest you.'" Colonel Wang Xiaotian, a member of the Communist Party side of the team, also met with reporters and said that the words of Rozmai and Min were "completely wrong." Rozmai did protest, but the Communist army asked the team to leave the city for the team's own safety. During the transition period when one army was withdrawing and another army was entering, chaos was inevitable in the city, and the Communist army was deeply concerned about the safety of the team. Rozmai recounted that the team members suffered hardships along the way from Chengde to Duolun on the border between Chahar and Jehol. He also stated that when two National Army planes strafed the team members, they could not tell them that the strafing target was the executive team. Rozmai continued: The team members were in a Communist electric truck, carrying four barrels of gasoline and hand grenades. When they were 13 miles south of Weichang, a P51 fighter plane came over the mountain peak and immediately pounced on the truck. Everyone in the car except the driver and a cook immediately jumped out. The truck was hit by machine gun bullets and exploded. At that time, the plane was only 600 feet above the ground, flying diagonally to avoid being hit by the explosion. After the team arrived in Duolun, the attitude of the Communist army completely changed, providing trucks and sending the team to Zhangjiakou on the 10th of this month.

### The Rural Areas Along the Nanxun Highway Are Desolate

Today, our newspaper's reporter took the special train of the reporter group to inspect the Nanxun Highway. Along the war-torn De'an, Zhanggongdu, and Wanjialing areas, the land along the highway for up to 200 li is left barren due to the lack of manpower and plowing cattle, making it impossible to use.

### The Government Has Not Issued an Attack Order, There Is Really No Need to Guarantee a Ceasefire, The President's Opinion Is Conveyed to Mr. Zhou by Special Envoy Marshall

[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan said on the 11th that President Chiang Kai-shek has refused to give a ceasefire guarantee, but has put forward a counter-proposal that the Communist Party cannot accept. President Chiang Kai-shek's opinion was conveyed to Mr. Zhou Enlai by General Marshall on the 11th. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Zhou had a long talk on the 11th, but Ambassador Stuart did not attend, and no date was set for the next consultation afterwards. Mr. Wang said: The situation is still serious, and it has not yet been decided whether the Communist Party will refuse to participate in the five-person group talks. According to previous claims by the Communist Party, they would not participate in the five-person group unless President Chiang Kai-shek issued a ceasefire order. When asked whether the Communist Party was prepared to make concessions to salvage the situation, Mr. Wang replied with "I". As for the content of President Chiang Kai-shek's counter-proposal, Mr. Wang believes that "now is not the time to disclose it." However, according to other sources who told a United Press reporter, President Chiang Kai-shek's proposal includes two points: (1) Regarding the ceasefire guarantee: This guarantee is really unnecessary, because the government has not issued any attack order. If the Communist Party stops attacking government troops, then a ceasefire is a certain result. (2) Regarding the five demands for the Communist army to withdraw from the area: This matter can be resolved by the reorganized National Government Committee. When asked whether General Marshall had ever put forward a compromise plan in today's meeting, Mr. Wang declared: "There is no compromise to be made on the war issue." He also said: Zhou Enlai has full authority to handle peace negotiations, and the demand for a ceasefire guarantee that he put forward is fully supported by the highest authorities in Yan'an.

### The Political Situation Remains Deadlocked, Special Envoy Marshall Receives Zhou Enlai for a Long Talk, Decided to Continue to Promote Peace with Ambassador Stuart

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Zhou Enlai visited Special Envoy Marshall at 10:30 AM on the 11th, and did not leave until 2:15 PM. Afterwards, according to a spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, the main topic discussed today was still the ceasefire issue, and no guarantee was obtained. Therefore, the current situation is extremely serious. As for what measures will be taken under the so-called serious situation of the Communist Party, it is not yet known. Immediately, the reporter went to the American Embassy to meet Fu Jingbo and asked about the prospects for peace talks after Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing. Fu said that as long as everyone can be patient and deal with it with a philosophical attitude, peace is always hopeful. As for the details of Mr. Zhou's meeting with Special Envoy Marshall on the 11th, Ambassador Stuart said that many issues are under discussion and it is not yet time to announce them, and there is no concrete news that can be reported. As for the proposal made by the ambassador to solve the problem politically and to form an informal five-person group meeting, it was not discussed today. According to Fu, old conditions are interpreted in new ways, but the goal is always to find a peaceful way to solve the problem. As for the question of the two sides approaching each other, it is believed that if everyone removes the heart of suspicion and replaces it with trust, they can definitely get closer. This is a belief, and if this belief is held, even if it is extremely hard, it will be done. The ambassador is a devout religious man, and Special Envoy Marshall is a world-renowned military scientist. They will promote this kind of peace with the greatest confidence. Someone then asked whether the ambassador would formulate a compromise opinion if the Communist Party insisted on solving the ceasefire issue first and the government advocated a political solution. Fu replied, "I believe it will be possible in the future." It is also said that Mr. Fu visited President Song at the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM, while Ambassador Stuart stayed in the hall in the afternoon to discuss hall affairs and did not receive any guests. As for whether Mr. Zhou will visit the ambassador or Special Envoy Marshall again on the 12th, it is not yet known. The negotiations have reached today's stage, and it is like a snail climbing a wall, the destination is still very far away.

### Establishment of Wuxi Command Post by Beijing Garrison Headquarters to Ensure Security in Southern Region and Expansion of Jurisdiction to Clear Out Scattered Bandits

[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 11th] Amidst the advancing situation in Northern Jiangsu, the lurking bandits and roaming malcontent elements in the Jiangnan area are taking the opportunity to stir up trouble in our rear. For the sake of stability, the Capital Garrison Headquarters has established a command post in Wuxi, initially named the Taihu Lake Area Bandit Suppression Command. Due to new missions beyond bandit suppression in the lake area, it has been renamed the Wuxi Command Post, directly under the Garrison Headquarters. Lieutenant General Chen Daqing remains the Director, and Major General Mao Sen remains the Chief of Staff. Its jurisdiction includes the Jiangnan area, as well as Yangzhong and the Zhejiang-Anhui border area, with full authority to handle the clearing operations. The Command Post is divided into four clearing zones and joint defense zones. Commanders with excellent military knowledge and experience are appointed to each. The clearing zones are the Taihu Lake area, the Yangcheng Lake area, the Maoshan area, and the Pu-Jian area. The joint defense zones include Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, and other areas. County magistrates within the jurisdiction are responsible for supervising the clearing operations.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] To strengthen security in the Capital Region, the Capital Garrison Headquarters has established twenty-seven inspection posts, stationed in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Suzhou, and other places. The request is currently awaiting approval from the Chairman. The posts are expected to be formally established by the end of this month at the latest. Furthermore, the Nanjing Municipal Government will establish a Military Affairs Section on October 1st, and units in the suburbs have been ordered to complete the organization of the populace by the 15th to ensure local security.

[Our Changshu Correspondence] The five-county joint defense conference of Changshu, Kunshan, Wuxi, Wujin, and Danyang has decided to establish a command post in Wuxi. The joint defense measures are as follows: Ships in the Yangtze River should be prohibited from docking on the south bank to prevent bandits from sneaking south. At the same time, reception centers should be established to provide an opportunity for repentance for those who surrender. After the meeting, County Magistrate Pan visited Wuxi to discuss joint defense matters between Wuxi and Kunshan with County Magistrate Xu. He returned to Changshu on the afternoon of the 8th to oversee defense matters.

### Severe Transportation Problems; Sea, Land, and Air All Unable to Reach Full Capacity; Contentions Over Cargo Transported from Shanghai

[United Press Local Dispatch] Transportation problems are a major obstacle to China's recovery. Shanghai was once an important entrepôt before the war, with imported goods transported to the interior. Today, Shanghai is congested with American goods, but even a year after the peace, the amount of these goods transported to the interior and major cities in North China remains minimal. Although sea, air, and rail facilities are developing, they are of little help. The stagnation of inland transportation is due to the CCP's destruction of railway lines, but the sea and air routes are not hindered. Water transport could be a major transportation route. Before the war, most inland port transport was handled by Chinese, British, and Japanese ships. The Japanese have now been overthrown, and British and other foreign ships are prohibited from carrying passengers and cargo in Chinese ports. Therefore, only Chinese ships currently handle waterway traffic. Many Chinese ships were lost or destroyed during the war, and today most ships are leased or purchased from the United States. However, these ships are absolutely insufficient to reach full transportation capacity. One can see this from the empty shelves in stores in North China. Some importers and exporters believe that more ships can be obtained from the United States to expand transportation capacity.

Incongruous Situations

Amidst these transportation inconveniences, the following incongruous situations are often found: A British ship sailed from Shanghai to Qingdao last month with a large portion of its cabin space empty. The ship could accommodate 250 passengers in its cabins and on deck, but it only had one lonely passenger. The ship was not allowed to load passengers and cargo in Chinese ports, only relief supplies. The next day, the ship sailed to Tianjin, and some uninvited Chinese passengers boarded the ship. They had no tickets and no documents. The crew told them that they could not carry passengers and asked them to go ashore, but they ignored them. Chinese police and soldiers came aboard to investigate, but they were unable to do anything. The ship finally set sail with ten free passengers. On the other hand, a Chinese ship also sailed to Qingdao at the same time. Its passenger capacity was 250, but it carried 900 passengers. According to passengers, the conditions on board were very difficult and did not meet world maritime standards. Few passengers had the opportunity to get a cabin, and 90% slept on deck, covering themselves with tarpaulins when it rained. A woman traveling to North China with two children brought her own food and a camp bed and also slept on deck. The prices in the ship's restaurant were higher than those on the Shanghai black market. According to the woman, "We were treated like coolies, so I will return to Shanghai by air."

Trouble with Land and Air Transport

Air transport itself is efficient and punctual, but after the American C-46, C-47, and C-54 aircraft were converted into passenger planes, only a portion of passengers were given priority. Ordinary passengers still had to book weeks in advance. Luggage space was limited, and official procedures were cumbersome, including filling out forms, finding guarantors, and obtaining police permits. Railway facilities, except for a few American-made streamlined trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line, often suffer from delays, so passengers often miss their luggage. Furthermore, the trains are crowded and seats are cramped. Therefore, the easiest and most profitable remedy is shipping. A businessman in Tianjin entertained a reporter in his magnificent new office, which had everything except goods. He analyzed the entire problem: "It's a simple math problem. Adding a few foreign ships, adding some efficiency, reducing some restrictions, and reducing some red tape would be enough."

### Hubei Province Decides to Build Zhongzheng Museum

### Difficulties in Smooth Transportation Hinder Recovery Efforts

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The recovery of transportation is still very difficult. Air transport is managed by the Executive Yuan, but the number of seats is limited. Five hundred people in Chongqing are registered and waiting to fly to Nanjing, and two thousand people are waiting to fly to Ping. Water transport ships are designated by the Ministry of Communications, and the shipping companies are responsible for transporting goods. However, the ships are often requisitioned for military service after sailing east, or they must also transport grain when sailing east, so the number of people stranded in Chongqing is very high. In addition, land transport is coordinated by the Highway Administration, but the recent fighting in eastern Henan has partially interrupted the Longhai Railway, so the recovery situation is very serious.

### Air Force Headquarters to Transport Relief Supplies to Western Yunnan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Due to the remote location of the UNRRA Yunnan Office and the difficulty of transportation, it is not easy to transport relief supplies. The Air Force Headquarters has agreed to assist and transport materials from Shanghai to Yunnan free of charge, which will begin soon.

### British Trade Delegation Scheduled to Depart for China Next Week; Head of Delegation, Sir Bowers, Describes Mission

Ambassador Hosts Farewell Banquet

[Reuters London Dispatch, 10th] Sir Bowers, head of the British trade delegation scheduled to depart for China next week, said at a luncheon at the Chinese Embassy today that the mission could be divided into two parts: exploratory and explanatory. After arriving in China, they will find out what the Chinese people need from Britain and discover what Chinese goods can be exported. He hoped that the results of this trip would further strengthen trade relations between China and Britain and promote friendship between the two countries. Chinese Ambassador Zheng Tianxi pointed out that there is a centuries-old history of mutual trust between China and Britain, which is a capital that cannot be estimated in gold or pounds. The British delegation's visit to China proves the British government's emphasis on Sino-British trade. Zheng believes that the difficulties caused by the war must first be overcome before satisfactory trade can be restored. He said that the development of trade should not only consider the capacity of the Chinese market but also remember mutual goodwill. He felt that the British trade delegation represented various industries that were of interest to the Chinese people and that their departure at this time was very timely.

Mr. Ma Gang, Director of Overseas Trade of the British Government, continued to speak, emphasizing that this trade delegation represents the government, entrepreneurs, and workers. The trade delegation will stay in China for two or three months, visiting major industrial and commercial centers for investigation, and submit a report to the government after returning home.

### British Ambassador to Host Reception Today

[Local Dispatch] British Ambassador Sir Steven and his wife visited General Edgerton, Director of UNRRA, yesterday morning for discussions. After attending a banquet hosted by the Customs Commissioner, they participated in a scientific symposium. This afternoon, from 4:30 to 6:30 pm, the Ambassador and his wife will hold a cocktail party on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel to entertain guests from all walks of life. The British Chamber of Commerce will host a banquet in the evening. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai next week and return to Nanjing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Li Jun, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters on the 11th that regarding the British Ambassador's response to reporters in Shanghai, hoping that China would abolish visa procedures for foreign nationals traveling and moving within the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already received notes from the envoys of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries suggesting this, and had consulted with the Ministry of Interior on May 29th of this year. They decided in principle to open up, adopting only entry and exit visas for foreign officials coming to China, and retaining the inland visa procedures for ordinary expatriates (merchants and travelers). This is because the special situation caused by China's War of Resistance has not yet been completely eliminated, and it is necessary for the safety of expatriates and the country. This case has recently been co-signed by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, and National Defense and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.

### Wu Jingxiong Delivers Speech: China and Vatican Both Seek Peace, Believes Foundation for Cooperation Can Be Enhanced

[Local Dispatch] Dr. Wu Jingxiong, China's newly appointed Minister to the Holy See, told reporters at his residence yesterday that the Vatican is an organization that transcends political blocs. Its entire system is based on social justice, originating from "benevolence," so it vigorously opposes aggression and advocates for peace. China is also a peace-loving country, and the spiritual connection between them is very close. There are currently 400 million Catholics in the world, and China's population is exactly the same. Their strength in promoting future world peace is very strong. China advocates building the country with the "kingly way," and the Pope advocates replacing struggle with coordination in the reconstruction of social order. Their views coincide, and he believes that the foundation for cooperation will be further enhanced in the future. After China won its final victory after eight years of resistance, the Pope praised Chairman Chiang's wise leadership, calling him "the savior of China" (Generalissimo is a savior of China). After the victory, he especially hopes to complete the great task of national construction under peaceful unification as soon as possible. Wu continued, "Minister Xie Shoukang has worked hard for many years to connect China with the Vatican and has established good diplomatic relations. Recently, Xie was awarded the Grand Cross Medal by the Vatican, which shows that the Pope attaches great importance to him. I feel that I am thin on talent and fresh on ability, but I will only follow Chairman Chiang's instructions and continue to work on the diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican in the past to seek enhancement." When reporters asked for his opinion on the domestic situation, Wu said, "As long as 400 million people are of one mind and one heart, and work hard to build the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, all problems can be solved, because Chairman Chiang is the most democratic leader, and his open-mindedness is something that ordinary people cannot imagine." When reporters asked about his departure date, he said, "I will decide after visiting Chairman Chiang."

Assemblymen severely criticized the salt administration, saying that the Salt Affairs Bureau is unwilling to develop the effectiveness of salt and only limits its production, putting the cart before the horse, which is a backward policy.

### UNRRA Funds Dwindling; Procedures for Shipping Goods to China Next Year Undetermined

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 10th] According to informed sources, the procedures for shipping goods to China in the first quarter of 1947, as planned by the UNRRA Central Committee in July last year, should be decided by the end of September, but as of now, UNRRA has not prepared to formulate these procedures. It is said that due to the seamen's strike and the resignation of several important UNRRA officials due to the upcoming end of affairs in Europe, the internal situation of the General Office is extremely chaotic. It is believed that UNRRA will not make any statements on the issue of China's relief program for 1947 until the end of this month. At the same time, a Chinese official expressed pessimism about the amount of relief supplies that China could obtain in the spring of 1947, because the reserve funds that UNRRA could use would be dwindling.

### Wu Ching-hsiung, Legal Genius

— Special Compilation by the Newspaper Archives

Wu Ching-hsiung was often referred to as a genius in Chinese legal circles. At the age of twenty-six, he became a renowned professor at the Soochow University Law School, and his book "Jurisprudence" was adopted as a textbook in many universities in the United States. At twenty-eight, he became the youngest, yet most prominent, judge in the newly recovered Provisional Court of Shanghai. He was one of the leading experts in the Legislative Yuan and the drafter of the first constitution of the Republic of China, the "May 5th Draft Constitution."

Behind a pair of tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses lay a pair of deep, scholarly eyes. His lips were often tightly closed, revealing his will and wisdom. This legal scholar, who is not yet fifty years old this year, was recently appointed as our country's envoy to the Vatican. Since the Pope elevated Tian Gengxin to Cardinal not long ago, the relationship between the Vatican and China has become increasingly close. However, the relationship between the church and the state is not only diplomatic but also religious and cultural. Wu Ching-hsiung is naturally the most suitable person to choose as such an envoy.

He has a glorious early history. At the age of twenty-two, he graduated with first-class honors from the then prestigious Soochow University Law School. At the age of twenty-three, he obtained a doctorate in law from the University of Michigan in the United States. Because of his outstanding academic performance, he was sent to France to study at the University of Paris. The following year, he went to the University of Berlin in Germany for research. At the age of twenty-six, he became a renowned professor at the Soochow University Law School.

At that time, Ding Wenjiang and Xu Weizhen were handling the recovery of the Provisional Court. Wu published an article in a magazine, putting forward his opinions on the Provisional Court. Xu read it and greatly admired him, so he appointed him as one of the judges of the Civil Court. Xu was the president of the Provisional Court at that time, but the two of them had never met before. On the day of the establishment, Wu took office and went to see the president. When the two met, they had to ask each other's name first, which made everyone laugh.

Wu later rose to become the president of the Provisional Court. In 1929, he was invited by Harvard University to go to the United States to lecture. This young president, who was only thirty-one years old, looked like a young man just out of school. Before leaving the country, he went to the Dollar Steamship Company to book a cabin and signed John C. H. wu in the name column. The foreigner in the steamship company looked him up and down and asked, "So you are the son of President Wu of the Provisional Court, going to the United States to study?"

In 1933, Wu was invited by President Sun Ke to serve as a member of the Legislative Yuan. Since then, he has been participating in the country's legislative work. His greatest contribution is naturally the drafting of the "May 5th Draft Constitution." This constitution was drafted based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of the separation of five powers and with reference to the characteristics of the constitutions of European and American countries. Some amendments were proposed in the Political Consultative Conference, but undoubtedly, this is still the only blueprint for the Constitution of China. Wu is extremely accomplished in English. Before the war, he ran a large-scale English publication "T'ien Hsia Monthly" in Shanghai. In one issue, he wrote an article comparing the artistic conception in Tang poetry with the poetry of 19th-century England. His beautiful writing made everyone see that he was a person with extremely high attainments in English literature.

Not long ago, I heard people in Chongqing say that Wu was instructed by Chairman Chiang to translate the Bible with reference to English, French, and Latin. He began writing on November 1, 1942, and completed the manuscript on October 31, 1944. Among them, the twenty-seven books of the New Testament and one book of Psalms were personally reviewed and revised by Chairman Chiang. "The Translation of the Psalms" will be published by the Commercial Press within the month. This is really the beginning of translating the classics in Chinese classical Chinese, and it is an immortal contribution to culture and religion.

Editorial

### How Will the Municipal Council Proceed in the Future?

The first meeting of the first Shanghai Municipal Council has been going on for three days as of yesterday, with six general meetings held. Although it seems very lively in the newspapers, it is generally still in the stage of reports and inquiries, and has not yet discussed proposals that are truly related to the welfare and burden of the citizens. The three or four million citizens are watching the future direction of the council with "ten thousand eyes staring," not just ten eyes seeing and ten fingers pointing. Councilors, you were very enthusiastic during the election, and you should think about why you wanted to run for election when you attend the meeting. If the first meeting of the council cannot come up with several proposals that are hoped for by the public, how will it face the citizens?

According to the general impression of reporters over the past three days, the council hall began to gradually feel like a "parliament" yesterday. In the previous two days, it seemed a little too polite and a little too solemn. We are not suggesting that ink boxes must fly and tables must be slapped in the council hall, but the council hall is not just a place for everyone to congratulate, compliment, and exchange greetings. The tension of inquiries and replies, and the debates of support and opposition, as seen yesterday, can show that the demeanor and spirit of democratic politics will be cultivated and successful in these scenes. We have long pointed out that the biggest task of the Municipal Council this time is to establish a model of a Chinese local council in Shanghai, this international metropolis. To achieve this goal, the Municipal Council must not be afraid of "publicity" and "debate," seek the truth and never violate the regulations, not obliterate minority opinions and still obey the decisions of the majority, and be able to argue red-faced in the meeting hall and shake hands and laugh as if nothing had happened after the meeting. Only in this way can it be like a council, and only in this way can China join the ranks of democratic countries. If councilors, like some people who advocate democracy, leave the meeting in a huff once their opinions are not passed, they will never see democracy.

Secondly, "no taxation without representation" is the earliest golden rule of British democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, the most important responsibility of the Municipal Council is to pass the municipal budget and review the municipal final accounts. We believe that it is better for the Municipal Council to meticulously and realistically pass a reasonable budget based on the future direction of municipal facilities than to decide on hundreds of trivial decorative proposals. The budget can not only show the income and expenditure of municipal finance but can also serve as a guide for all government administration. Only matters stipulated in the budget can be handled; those deleted should not be handled. The final accounts and the previous revenue and expenditure estimates can show whether the government's work for the citizens is legal in terms of revenue and wasteful in terms of expenditure. It should be known that every penny of government expenditure is a drop of fat and blood of the citizens. The draft general budget for the second half of this year has been submitted to the Municipal Council; this is the only major case. According to the explanation, the income and expenditure are insufficient, and an additional 33.327 billion yuan in new donations and taxes must be listed to cope with the expenditure. We still do not know what new donations and taxes the government will add, or whether these donations and taxes will be borne equally by every citizen, or heavily taxed on those who made fortunes during the national crisis, made victory fortunes, and received property. In particular, we do not know what municipal facilities will be used to benefit the citizens after the new donations and taxes are added. Therefore, we can only reserve criticism at this time; but the council should be clear about the importance of its responsibility when examining and discussing this major case. Have the government's administrative guidelines and work plans been clarified? Has the Municipal Council passed these guidelines and plans first? Have the past revenue and expenditure estimates and expenditure final accounts been reviewed? Do the councilors have materials for reference on the budget final accounts of the former two concession-era public works bureaus and the pre-war government budget final accounts? Have the councilors widely solicited opinions on what municipal affairs the general public urgently expects the government to handle? All of these are important keys to discussing the budget. There are many social elites, accounting experts, and representatives from the people in the council, and it is expected that they will not fail the expectations of millions of citizens.

A New Page in the Relationship Between Our Country and the Vatican

The Executive Yuan passed a resolution at its 758th meeting the other day to appoint Wu Ching-hsiung as the envoy to the Vatican. This is a new page in the diplomatic relationship between our country and the Vatican. It is noted that the establishment of diplomatic relations between our country and the Vatican coincided with the emergency of the international situation after the Pearl Harbor incident and was a major achievement of our wartime diplomacy. In the spring of 1942, our government appointed Xie Shoukang as our first envoy to the Vatican. After Xie took office, he made many contributions to promoting the relationship between our country and the Vatican, and finally, during his tenure, the first cardinal of Chinese nationality was appointed, and the church system in China was established. At that time, due to wartime relations, the Vatican was unable to send diplomatic envoys to China; now the Vatican has appointed its first envoy to China, and our country is also sending a legal scholar of international renown to the Vatican at this time. Thus, our country and the Vatican have established normal diplomatic relations. Wu, as a Catholic and an internationally renowned legal scholar, will be able to perform his duties satisfactorily.

The Vatican City is a small place, but envoys from all countries gather there; even in the United States, President Truman has a personal representative, Ambassador Taylor, stationed there. This is because the Pope is the highest moral authority in the world, and the spiritual love of 400 million Catholics around the world is entrusted to him. All his words and deeds are enough to affect the overall situation of the world. Today's world is in the aftermath of a great war, and the reconstruction of the post-war order lies in ensuring lasting peace. The Pope, as the highest moral authority, can have a direct or indirect impact on the reconstruction of world peace. Our government's appointment of our country's top scholar as envoy to the Vatican shows how much the government values the relationship between our country and the Vatican.

Since Catholicism was reintroduced to China during the late Ming Dynasty, it has made great contributions to promoting the exchange of Chinese and Western cultures. In modern times, the number of believers has exceeded four million, and priests are all over the country. Although the percentage of the total population is not high, it is still an important force. The doctrines it upholds encompass Confucianism and Taoism and are very close to the principles of self-cultivation and family management. Its spirit of dealing with the world emphasizes perseverance and simplicity, which is in line with the "practical and solid" advocated by our Chairman. Now the country is in the process of building a nation, and the most important thing in building a nation is the establishment of moral order, which our Chairman has repeatedly emphasized at all costs. Since our government attaches great importance to the relationship between our country and the Vatican, we hope that Catholics across the country can understand the government's good intentions, put the spirit of Catholic doctrines into practice, and establish a new atmosphere for the country. To reverse the current immoral trend of "rampant human desires," we need the infusion of the Catholic spirit. The nation and the country have high hopes for Catholics. May Catholics do well!

Pan-Asian Conference

According to a report by Agence France-Presse from New Delhi, India, Prime Minister Nehru of the Indian Interim Government will invite Asian countries to hold a Pan-Asian Conference in India next year. The transmission of this news is quite abrupt. Since we have not yet received official confirmation, we do not want to comment on the convening of the Pan-Asian Conference in India. However, since the name of the Pan-Asian Conference has been put forward, we would like to express some opinions here.

In principle, if this regional Pan-Asian Conference follows the example of the Pan-American Conference and does not conflict with the United Nations' institutions, it may make a great contribution to the maintenance of security and order, and we can naturally agree with it. However, the convening of the Pan-American Conference has historical and other relationships existing between them; the situation in Asia and the Americas does not seem to be the same. If we want to follow the old rules of the Pan-American Conference, it seems that it will take a lot of discussion between the initiators and the hosts. Furthermore, the so-called Pan-Asian Conference may also take a posture similar to the so-called Pan-Arab, or it may be a people's conference without the participation of government representatives.

But no matter what form it takes, from a practical political point of view, it is questionable whether the convening of the so-called Pan-Asian Conference at this time is a wise move. Judging from the existing signs, the time for the convening of this Pan-Asian Conference at this time is not yet ripe. Most of the people in Asia have just been liberated from the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" advocated by the Japanese warlords. They have suffered deeply, both spiritually and physically, from the "Pan-Asian" doctrine that has been poisoned. Although this is Japanese-style "Pan-Asian" doctrine, since the "Pan-Asian" tune has been trampled by the Japanese warlords for a while, we must first do some purification work. Otherwise, if we inadvertently repeat the old tune, it will only evoke painful memories for the people. Furthermore, given the current international situation, the convening of this Pan-Asian Conference is likely to be sacrificed as a "sacrifice." From the standpoint of the Chinese people, the convening of the Pan-Asian Conference at this time is still under consideration. Therefore, we believe that a person as intelligent and talented as Nehru should still consider this relatively major issue.

### White House Convenes Military Leaders' Conference to Discuss Unified Command of the Three Armed Forces: Prelude to the US Government's Military Reorganization

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, President Truman held a meeting at the White House last night with Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower, and Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz, which is a sign of the unified command of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. It is heard that the President intends to stipulate a formula to eliminate friction among the commanders of various departments. Regarding this matter, the President will sign two decrees. The first decree stipulates the establishment of a unified National Defense Committee, with the President as the chairman. The second decree stipulates the establishment of a committee to protect the nation's important resources and raw materials that can be used for combat. This committee will ensure that the nation's war capabilities are expanded to the maximum extent. According to the first decree, before the complete unified command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the supreme commanders of each department should maintain considerable independence. As for the National Resources Committee, it will be responsible for implementing the President's recent order regarding the ten-year resource storage plan. This plan stipulates that the US will purchase essential national defense raw materials that it currently lacks from the world market at a cost of 4 billion US dollars over the next ten years. At the same time, British Chief of Staff Montgomery will come to the US from Canada for a visit. The US decision on unified command will inevitably have an impact on British military affairs.

[United Press, Jackson, Mississippi, 10th Dispatch] US Senator Eastland issued a warning today, stating that unless our country stops all forms of appeasement and adopts an open and strong diplomatic policy, war with the Soviet Union cannot be avoided. He said that although there is no immediate danger of war with the Soviet Union at present, the Soviet Union's plan to support communism throughout the world is becoming increasingly clear.

The United States is Determined to Break the Soviet Line

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] The US State Department once resolved to break the Soviet line. The following is part of the reason, from which we can see the crux of the US-Soviet dispute: (1) The Atlantic Charter has been recognized by the Soviet Union, which does not stipulate giving territory to any country, but the Soviet Union has acquired the Karelian Isthmus from Finland, Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Romania, and slightly acquired the land east of Poland, and acquired Ruthenia from Czechoslovakia. Poland and Czechoslovakia are both United Nations countries, but the Soviet Union has not taken them into consideration. With the exception of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States have not acquired land from other countries.

### War Between the US and the Soviet Union Can Be Avoided Only Through Goodwill and Understanding

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th Dispatch] Recent developments in Europe and other places have increased the amount of war talk in Washington, and hardly a day goes by without some columnists issuing warnings about a "second Pearl Harbor" or a "pincer attack" on Alaska. However, according to the opinions of American women leaders, all rumors about war are the natural result of mutual suspicion and fear. According to Ms. Dickinson, president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, who recently returned from the Soviet Union, Soviet people admit that only friendship and goodwill towards the American people can avoid war. Although Ms. Dickinson does not like the Soviet way of life at all, she believes that there is no reason why the US and the Soviet Union cannot get along in a friendly manner.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 10th Dispatch] At today's meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the Chinese representative proposed establishing a subcommittee to study economic development issues to raise the economic standards of certain countries. The current living standards of these countries may become one of the causes of war.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 10th Dispatch] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie recently suggested to the Economic and Social Council that a temporary committee be established to draft a set of regulations that clearly stipulate the legal status of international refugee relief agencies.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th Dispatch] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky declared today in the Security Council that the Council should immediately eliminate the threat to peace posed by Greek policy. Communists in most countries have contributed greatly to the victory of World War II. It is inappropriate for Spain, Portugal, and Greece to adopt Hitler's anti-communist policies. The Soviet Union intends to establish friendly countries around its borders, and this move is not an expansionist movement.

### Greece Decides to Outlaw the Communist Party

### Nuremberg Tribunal Scheduled to Pronounce Verdict at the End of the Month; Rejects Television Broadcast

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 11th Dispatch] The Nuremberg International Tribunal has concluded the trial of 21 German war criminals and is scheduled to pronounce the verdict at the end of the month. Someone proposed broadcasting the verdict to the world on television, but the court rejected this proposal on the grounds that it would detract from the dignity of the court. However, loudspeakers will be installed to allow the public to hear the verdict.

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 10th Dispatch] The judges of the Nuremberg Tribunal are meeting day and night to complete the verdicts of the 22 Nazi defendants before September 23.

### South Africa Announces Abandonment of Demands for Reparations from Italy

[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 11th (Broadcast): The Economic Committee for Italy of the peace conference met today. The South African representative took a surprising action, announcing the abandonment of South Africa's demands for reparations from Italy. It is said that Italy made many contributions and significant sacrifices after joining the Allied forces and should be consoled. Also, France today submitted a document to the committee, pointing out that Italian troops had caused significant losses in France, valued at 23.5 billion US dollars, but formal reparation demands have not yet been made. In addition, Norway is demanding 20 million yuan in reparations from Italy, Egypt is demanding 10 million pounds, Mexico is demanding 5.4 million yuan and 43 million lire, and Iraq is demanding 1.6 million dinars (Iraqi currency).

### Romanian Political Committee Approves Term for Soviet Troops in Romania

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] The Romanian Political Committee today unanimously approved the plan of the four foreign ministers, allowing Soviet troops to remain in Romania for a period equal to the Soviet occupation period in Austria. The committee disregarded the Soviet Union's fierce opposition and passed, by a vote of seven to five, the British proposal that Romania should especially respect the property and interests of Jews within its borders. The British proposal did not specifically name Jews, but only suggested that the property of foreigners in Romania should be respected regardless of race, gender, language, or religion.

### Second Day of the London Conference: Future of Palestine Bleak; Arabs and Jews Still Insisting on Preconceived Notions

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 11th (Broadcast): The Palestine problem conference continued in London today. The Arab representative delivered an important speech, saying, "Palestine should belong to the Arabs. Palestine has no connection with the Jews. The Jewish problem is a very broad issue in the world and requires multi-faceted cooperation to be resolved." The representatives then held secret talks. The public meeting will continue tomorrow.

[Reuters, London, 11th] On the first day of the Palestine conference, Prime Minister Attlee and Colonial Secretary Hall still personally attended. Syrian representative al-Khouri spoke on the spot, strongly arguing against allowing the land of Palestine to be used as a residence for other ethnic groups. The Arab countries firmly oppose the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. Al-Khouri's words were the Arab countries' formal response to the opening speech made by Attlee. The representatives unanimously opposed the partition plan, which is completely contrary to the position of Kutscher of the Jewish Agency. Therefore, the possibility that the British and Arab representatives would discuss the partition plan in the meeting so that the Jewish representatives could attend later seems to have been completely eliminated.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Kutscher, the US representative of the Jewish Agency, said today that the Jewish Agency's failure to participate in the first meeting of the London Conference was a matter of principle, not a tactic. When I met Foreign Secretary Bevin in Paris, I asked him to hold private negotiations with the Jewish and Arab groups as preparation for the London Conference, but Bevin refused. The Jewish Agency believes that being willing to discuss the partition plan is a major concession on our part. The Arab representatives did not make concessions but attended the meeting with an uncompromising plan.

### Human Rights Court Case Rejected

[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 11th (Broadcast): The Legal Committee of the peace conference today rejected the Australian representative's proposal to establish a human rights court in the peace treaty to protect minorities in former enemy countries, considering it outside the scope of the peace conference's work. The vote was fourteen to two, with five abstentions. It is generally believed that this issue should be referred to the United Nations Economic and Social Council for discussion.

### US Airmen's Loss of Life: South Agrees to Compensation

But the case has not been fully resolved

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Undersecretary of State Clayton said to reporters today that regarding the two incidents of Yugoslavia shooting down US planes, Yugoslavia has temporarily agreed to provide compensation for the loss of life of the five pilots, but it still refuses to compensate for the loss of the planes. If the compensation issue can be resolved satisfactorily, the United States is willing to close the case, but negotiations are still a long way off. Clayton did not announce the amount of compensation requested by the United States. According to diplomatic circles, it is less than 400,000 US dollars. Clayton also reiterated the State Department's statement that the government does not intend to prevent the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration from transporting relief supplies to Yugoslavia because of the plane incidents.

### British Cabinet Begins Reorganization

Meeting of US Maritime Union Members Before the Strike

(Special Photograph from the New York Times for Our Newspaper)

### New York Port Seamen Resume Work as a Result of the Mayor's Support

[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 11th (Broadcast from New York): The New York port seamen's strike, which lasted nearly a week, has resumed work with the intervention of New York Mayor O'Dwyer. It is reported that the New York mayor has promised to support the union's insistence that the Wage Stabilization Board should withdraw its order.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 10th] American shipping workers have been on strike for five days, and there is still no sign of a resolution. This strike has paralyzed American maritime commerce and seriously disrupted domestic shipping. The New York freight workers' strike, which has lasted a week, also has a distant resolution date, and countless residents of New York are bound to feel a shortage of food. The hope of ending the national shipping strike rests on the meeting held by the Wage Stabilization Board on the 10th. The heads of the unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor insist that the strike can be ended only if the Wage Stabilization Board withdraws its previous resolution. However, the situation today is serious and complex. Twenty-five thousand Valley freight workers are also on strike. Unless their wage demands are met, they will block all freight to New York City. The freight workers' strike has also affected newspapers in various places, as newspaper offices feel a shortage of paper. All morning newspapers have therefore suspended publication, except for the Daily News, because it has a large supply of paper. Labor leaders feel that workers are being squeezed by rising prices and short wages and believe that rising prices must be stopped to avoid a spreading strike.

### Japanese Seamen Also Stage a General Strike

National Railway Employees Prepare to Support

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 10th] The Japanese Seamen's Union issued a strike order yesterday, and the long-brewing general strike of Japanese seamen has finally been realized. As of August 1, the total number of Japanese ships was 625, with a total tonnage of 1,068,693 tons. Among them, 564 ships are currently sailing, including those repatriating Japanese prisoners of war, totaling 960,057 tons. The total number of Japanese seamen is about 86,000, and members of the Seamen's Union account for about 70%, or 54,000 people. It is difficult to predict the number of ships currently on strike nationwide, but it is estimated that those belonging to the Ship Allocation Association reach about 67,000 tons.

### Wilde Testifies in the International Court: Japanese Army Atrocities in Singapore: More Than 8,000 Overseas Chinese Killed in One Year

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Colonel Wilde, a British officer who was once captured by the Japanese, testified in the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal this morning, describing the Japanese army's massacre of overseas Chinese and mistreatment of prisoners of war in Singapore. It is said that on February 22, 1942, I went to see Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Sugita to protest that the Japanese army often shot more than 100 overseas Chinese without cause and forced British prisoners to bury them. Sugita replied that the overseas Chinese who were killed were all bad people and that bad people would be executed at any time and anywhere. I investigated that at least 8,000 or more overseas Chinese were killed by the Japanese army in one year. Although the Japanese army declared that it would always protect the safety of non-combatants, it did not fulfill it in fact. He also described the tragic massacre when Japanese infantry rushed into the Alexandra military hospital in Singapore on February 13, 1942. It is said that the Japanese army rampaged through the hospital, killing everyone they met, and even patients and doctors who were undergoing surgery were not spared. Many people wearing Red Cross badges were also stabbed or shot. A total of 20 medical officers, 60 patrolmen, and 20 recovered soldiers died. The witness said that a Japanese officer shot the Red Cross flag on the roof of the hospital with a gun, and several Japanese soldiers ordered the wounded on the sickbeds to stand up and shoot or stab them. Wilde continued to describe the inhuman life of the 50,000 prisoners of war in the Singapore concentration camp and the Japanese army's insults and abuse of them. All Allied officers and soldiers, regardless of rank, had to salute even the lowest-ranking Japanese soldiers.

### Jinnah Appeals for Avoidance of Civil War

[Report from Our Newspaper] New Delhi, 11th (Broadcast): The situation in Bombay and other places is improving today. Although there are still minor conflicts, there are no casualties. The Governor-General of India invited Jinnah to meet with him. Jinnah issued a statement today, reiterating his opposition to any bloodshed or armed action.

[United Press, Bombay, 11th] Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League, said that India is on the verge of a devastating civil war. The recent bloody riots are a sign of an approaching all-out civil war. It can only be avoided through frank and rapid diplomatic negotiations. Jinnah reiterated his willingness to participate in the "peace conference" in London to "restart the resolution of the Indian problem."

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 11th] The Punjab Provincial Muslim League has decided to hold a meeting in Lahore on the 16th to determine the final details of the "direct action" plan. But first, cancel the extreme resistance action. If it is ineffective, continue with direct action.

[Reuters, Bombay, 10th] The police commissioner has ordered the extension of the curfew in the riot areas. Today is a Hindu festival, and the authorities have stepped up preparations again. However, the situation in the city is still stable.

### Japanese Inflation

Banknote Issuance Exceeds 60 Billion Mark

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 11th] As of the 9th, the amount of Japanese banknotes issued had reached 60.1711 million yen. It is believed that the highest record of the old banknote issuance amount of 61.8 billion yen will be broken around the 20th of this month. In the future, due to the reconstruction of the new price system, the implementation of this year's budget, and the release of reconstruction financial funds, inflation will increase. Although there is the collection of property tax, it is expected to approach the 100 billion yen mark by the end of this year.

### Unprecedented Heat in the Red Sea

[Reuters, On Board Ship in the Red Sea, 11th] When the British team took the Stirling Castle to Australia, the temperature in the sunlight in the Red Sea reached 138 degrees Fahrenheit, and 110 degrees in the shade. The ship's staff said that the temperature in the Red Sea had never been hotter than this. The passengers felt as hot as in a Turkish bath, and their weight had decreased.

### The Senate Held the Fifth and Sixth Meetings Yesterday; Review of Proposals Begins Today; Senators Question Senior Officials of the Land Administration Bureau for Dereliction of Duty and Corruption, Creating a Heated and Tense Atmosphere Throughout the Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper] The fifth and sixth meetings of the City Senate were held yesterday in the morning and afternoon, respectively. The meeting began at 9:15 am, with 150 senators present and 10 people in attendance. As of yesterday, the secretariat had received a total of 352 proposals and 5 motions from the mayor. In the morning, Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, reported on the general situation of policy implementation. Subsequently, the Speaker proposed inquiry methods. In addition to written inquiries, verbal inquiries should first be written on a slip and submitted to the Speaker, and inquiries should be made in the order of the number reported from the speaker's platform, with a focus on general inquiries. Eight senators raised questions to Director Zhu, among which the case of dereliction of duty and corruption of senior officials of the Land Administration Bureau raised by Tao Baichuan created the most tense atmosphere. The assembly then discussed the issue of appointing representatives to participate in the investigation team again. Although opinions were divided and the discussion was heated, it was finally resolved to make a decision after the head of the team, Zhang Zhiben, returned to Shanghai.

In the afternoon, Director Gu of the Finance Bureau reported on financial policy implementation. After Director Gu's report, Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau responded to the verbal inquiries raised by the senators the day before. At 4:00 pm, Speaker Pan temporarily excused himself to attend the weekend symposium for scientists to entertain British Ambassador Stevenson, and Deputy Speaker Xu Jichang took his place. After Director Zhang finished answering, nine senators raised verbal inquiries to the Finance Bureau, which Director Gu answered one by one. Subsequently, the Speaker reported the location of today's review committee meeting, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm.

Today, the General Assembly will hold the first and second review meetings in three separate locations by ten review committees.

### Zhu Ping Reports on Land Administration: More Than 80,000 Land Registrations; Urges Implementation of Land Policy

Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, reported on the city's land administration work, especially emphasizing the relationship between land administration work and local autonomy, repeatedly citing Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament. He said: Regarding land administration work, on the one hand, it is political because the elements of a country are land, people, and sovereignty. On the other hand, it is also economic, because land, labor, and capital are indispensable for production, so land administration work is extremely complicated.

Land administration work is closely related to local autonomy work. "Autonomy must begin with land administration." The Outline of National Reconstruction states: To implement land administration, land value tax must be levied. The economic strength of local autonomy can rely on income from land administration. Currently, land tax and land survey are being actively carried out, and the rice will be used for autonomous funding. The current central tasks are land consolidation, land registration, land liquidation, land value assessment, and implementation of land value tax. The work in the past three months is briefly reported as follows:

Land registration is quite complicated. The processing principles are divided into four points: 1. Simplify procedures. 2. Shorten the time. 3. Reduce fees. 4. Severely punish extortion. Some of the above points have been completed. For example, title deeds can be used for financial circulation. However, registration review must involve verification of the title deed. However, delivering it to the Land Administration Bureau hinders turnover, so most landowners are unwilling to register. To reduce difficulties, a photo system was adopted. When verifying the title deed, submit two photos in addition to the original document. The original certificate is returned first, and the photos are retained. Regarding transfer registration, as long as the new registration is completed, it can be completed within one day. Registration fees have also been suspended, but land registration procedures are indeed too complicated, and things are also too complex. In the past, the French Concession handled land registration from 1910, but it was not completed until before the war. The former Public Concession took even longer. The Shanghai Municipal Government only handled more than 160,000 land registrations from 1927 to 1937. As for the land applied for in the past three months, there are more than 80,000 pieces, and more than 500 pieces have been completed.

In the Concession era, foreigners were given title deeds when they bought land. However, for some title deeds, although the household name is a foreigner, the property rights have long belonged to Chinese people, and in the past, Chinese people often bought land in the name of foreigners. After the victory, when sorting out title deeds, foreigners said that the household name was a foreigner and should belong to foreigners. This matter has a great impact on our country's sovereignty. After Mayor Wu's many compromises, a solution was reached. All property rights of countries whose names are Chinese belong to Chinese people.

Public Land Clearance The city's public land is very chaotic because there have been many changes during the concession and puppet organization era. Now all the files and archives of public land have been collected completely. The current problem is how to clear it and how to take it over. 民應應應　　　　應應。It is reasonable to return the land requisitioned from the people by the enemy and puppets, but it is very difficult because some of it has been used for national defense, such as airports. Farmland should have been returned earlier, but it is also difficult because some of it was taken over by the central government. Regarding the issue of the demarcation of provincial and municipal boundaries, the boundaries of this city were decided by the central government in 1927. Currently, it has not been completely taken over because the Soviet government has not agreed. The central government must send personnel to negotiate. Regarding land value tax, we are actively preparing, and the central government ordered that it must be implemented this year.

There are two principles for the housing shortage problem: 1. Deal with the current situation and strengthen lease management. 2. Encourage construction. New houses are exempt from land value tax for two years and house donation for one year, and rent is not restricted.

Finally, report on the land policy. After Wallace came to China to investigate, he believed that the prerequisite for China's industrialization was to implement land reform, and the tiller must have his own land. Stuart also said: To achieve China's peaceful reunification, land reform must be implemented. In fact, this was said by Sun Yat-sen decades ago, and now is the urgent stage where it must be done. Although Shanghai is a commercial and industrial area, it also has more than one million acres of farmland. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country. To implement the country's most important facilities, it still needs to start in Shanghai. As long as all the virtuous senators have the determination, if there is a decision on this, we have a way in administrative technology, and any difficulties are not worth mentioning.

### The Question of Whether to Participate in the Investigation Team: A FierCE Debate Ensues, Opinions Among Councilors Differ, Original Proposal Retained

Regarding the question of whether the Municipal Council should send representatives to participate in the investigation team, a lively debate arose the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, after the Director of the Land Bureau finished answering inquiries, Speaker Pan announced the continuation of the discussion on this issue. Councilors spoke enthusiastically and passionately. Some advocated for participation, some opposed it, some advocated for conditional participation, some advocated for forming a separate receiving investigation team, and some advocated for inviting the investigation team to the assembly to report before deciding on a stance. However, in the end, it was decided to temporarily retain the case, and the Speaker would cable Zhang, the head of the team, to return to Shanghai within three days to clarify everything before further discussion.

Before discussing the main topic, the Secretary-General reported the results of inquiries to the investigation team on two points: First, the investigation team's work in Shanghai would last a total of fifty days, from July 24th to September 13th. Extending the investigation time would probably be impossible. Second, the participation of council members would only be of an assisting nature, and the number of people could not be increased.

After the report, Feng Youzhen took the stage to speak. He said, "This issue needs to be considered calmly. Regarding the council forming its own investigation team, I am afraid it is inappropriate, because the council is a legislative body, not a supervisory body. In fact, it cannot independently carry out the investigation and receipt of materials, because it is not within its scope of authority. Speaking of refusing to participate, it may be unavoidable to disappoint the more than four million citizens of Shanghai. The Municipal Council originally represents the more than four million citizens, and what the citizens are most dissatisfied with is the receiving work, so the Municipal Council should investigate whenever it has the opportunity, doing its duty for one day. Otherwise, the citizens will say that the council is abandoning its responsibility. But after participating, it is to actively investigate, with the council announcing to the citizens and asking them to assist in reporting. Secondly, after participating, the council should still maintain its independent status. Moreover, three representatives should be sent: one lawyer, one accountant, and one from the press." Feng also nominated Zhan Wenhu as the press representative.

After that, Ma Junshuo expressed his opinion: "The investigation team is organized by the central government, and local groups cannot change it, and it will end on September 13th. Therefore, we will form another Shanghai District Receiving Committee to contact the public and implement a long-term and thorough investigation. This committee is of a voluntary nature, with one director and eleven members, from whom one person will be selected to participate in the investigation team, becoming a bridge between the people and the investigation team." At this time, Speaker Pan issued a statement saying: "What is being discussed now is the question of whether to participate or not. As for the organization of an investigation committee, that is another matter, and will not be discussed for the time being."

Others who spoke in favor of participation included Wang Jian'e. He said, "Because the government does not trust the dispatched officials, it organized the investigation team. We should participate and supervise the investigation team. However, in addition to participating, we should also set up another organization." Zhu Taiyao also favored participation. He said, "The steps for participation should be considered. First, we must understand the past work of the investigation team, and at the same time, we must extend the investigation time."

Huang Zhensheng said, "Since the investigation team has sent a letter inviting us, whether to participate or not is up to the assembly to decide. Shanghai has the most materials received from the occupied areas, and what has been received is all the people's hard-earned money. The investigation team should report to the assembly on its achievements in Shanghai."

Lu Shidao opposed participation. He said, "We cannot be decorative pieces. Participating is a waste of time and will not yield any results. Moreover, in fact, the investigation team will end on the 13th, which is only forty-eight hours away. What can be investigated in these forty-eight hours? The citizens deeply hate the corruption in the receiving process. They hope for a clear and complete result, so we must set up another investigation agency."

Tao Baichuan, who first expressed opposition and expressed explosive opinions, said, "I personally did not participate in the work of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, so I oppose participation, not for personal convenience. However, councilors present who have participated in the work of the management bureau should recuse themselves when discussing this issue. In addition, the investigation team officially started the investigation work on August 11th, and they should have notified us when this assembly was formally established on August 13th. Now they have gone to Hangzhou, and the work is about to end, and then they come to notify us, which seems to be completely insincere. Although we do not have a legal basis to form our own investigation team, others do not have a legal basis to oppose our organization."

At this time, Lu Yinchu moved to stop the discussion, which was passed without objection. However, before the vote, Zhang Zhihan proposed: "It may be better to temporarily retain this case, and the Speaker should cable Zhang, the head of the team, to return to Shanghai within three days to clarify everything before putting it to a vote, because it is not yet known whether the investigation team will definitely end in forty-eight hours."

The result of the vote was passed with one hundred votes.

According to a certain councilor's prediction: in the future, those who support participation may be in the majority. What will happen in the end, let's wait and see!

### Hospitals Only Ask for Money When Admitting Patients: Ways to Improve Include Increasing Beds and Promoting Medical Ethics: Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei Responds to Councilors' Inquiries

Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei verbally responded to the inquiries of councilors the day before yesterday as follows: (1) In addition to the 150 million yuan for the epidemic prevention department, an additional budget of 400 million yuan has been added, and over 200 million yuan has already been received and spent. Some people have criticized the epidemic prevention work in the suburbs as not being diligent enough, but because epidemic prevention is an urgent measure, it is based on pathology, with a distinction between what is important and what is not. In addition, insufficient manpower is also a fact. Fundamentally, the issue of permanent epidemic prevention work is still a matter of insufficient funding. Regarding the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases, we are currently in contact with the Executive Yuan to establish an express treatment center to treat them with penicillin. In addition, we plan to establish vaccination stations. (2) Regarding environmental sanitation, the main difficulty in clearing garbage is the lack of tools. We have now purchased 40 trucks from the Executive Yuan, but it is still not enough. Regarding the issue of contracting out the removal of night soil, in principle, it is of course better to do it ourselves. This matter is still under consideration. There are problems with requisitioning land for the construction of public toilets. Only two have been built so far. Of the total budget of 100 million yuan, 50 million yuan has been allocated in advance to build 150 night soil carts. Regarding pharmaceutical management, we will try our best to increase the number of beds, increase the number of free and semi-free places, and vigorously rectify the tendency of some hospitals to only ask for money when admitting patients, and strive to promote medical ethics. Zhang finally declared: The Health Bureau will start compiling statistics on births, deaths, and causes of death from January 1st next year.

### Each Committee of Review to Begin Reviewing Proposals Today

[This newspaper report] The Municipal Council will hold meetings of each committee of review for proposals today. The council specially hosted a banquet yesterday at 6:00 PM at the Yiyuan to invite the conveners of the ten committees and the secretaries of each committee to discuss relevant review matters. As suggested by Councilor Zhao Dihua, the majority passed a motion to have the Ninth Committee review the municipal budget and final accounts, and the Tenth Committee review proposals and policy reports related to finance and land. It is also proposed to first discuss the five motions submitted by the mayor (all related to finance, taxation, etc.). Zhou Feicheng, the convener of the Sixth Committee, resigned due to official business and was replaced by Feng Youzhen. Xu Shihao and Feng Youzhen, the conveners of the Tenth Committee, resigned and were replaced by Zhu Fuju and Wu Zhengxuan. These changes will be submitted to the assembly for approval. Reporters are allowed to attend the committee reviews, but they must abide by the conveners' decisions if they believe that a certain proposal should not be published in advance.

The review meetings will be held from approximately 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The locations are divided into three places: the First Committee at Pubo Road, the Fifth District Office, the Fourth Committee at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the other eight committees still at the Yiyuan.

The list of secretaries invited to attend each committee is as follows: First Committee: Li Xuexun, Second Committee: Wang Zhijing, Third Committee: Mei Jianyin, Fourth Committee: Xie Yanqing, Fifth Committee: Zhang Zhongfu, Sixth Committee: Li Caiqing, Seventh Committee: Lei Kenan, Eighth Committee: Cheng Qizhou, Ninth Committee: Chen Kecheng, Tenth Committee: Wang Bing.

### Total Final Accounts of Revenue and Expenditure for the Autonomous Portion of This City in the 34th Year

[This newspaper report] It is reported that the total final accounts of the autonomous portion of this city for the 34th year are for the four and a half months of revenue and expenditure from the date of establishment on August 16th of the 34th year to the end of December. The final accounts have already been compiled within the prescribed time limit. The total amount of the final accounts of revenue and expenditure is 1,849,507,550 yuan each. The item of final revenue includes 487,653,822 yuan of central government subsidies.

### Municipal Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan Reports: To Run Shanghai Well, Monthly Expenses Must Increase by 6 Billion Yuan. Current Tax Revenue Is Still in an Unreasonable Stage

The meeting was announced to be opened at 3:15 PM. After the Secretary-General reported on the number of attendees and the brief situation of the morning meeting, Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan began his report. Mr. Gu's speech was divided into two aspects: revenue and expenditure situation and the collection system:

(1) Revenue and expenditure situation: In the first half of the year, the city's local revenue was over 14.59 billion yuan, and expenditure was over 20.72 billion yuan, a shortfall of over 6.13 billion yuan, all of which was compensated by central government subsidies. Generally speaking, the city's local revenue has been progressing month by month. The reasons are that, first, the result of rising prices; second, the result of rectifying tax collection. Because prices rise, tax revenue naturally increases. However, prices have only increased by more than two times in the past six months, while tax revenue has increased by more than six times. The net increase is entirely due to the effectiveness of rectifying tax collection. The revenue and expenditure in June had even reached a balance, but because the salaries of civil servants were adjusted at the end of the month and paid out in July, there was another shortfall. Through hard work in July and August, August was close to balance again, but because the salaries of civil servants were adjusted again, it was difficult to make up for it from September onwards. The repeated adjustments of the salaries of central government employees and teachers, although providing some relief to those who have suffered hardships for a long time, are a huge burden on the government's finances.

(2) Collection system: 1. House tax: The house tax registers for districts such as Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and former extraterritorial roads were scattered and incomplete when they were taken over last year and must be re-surveyed. Preparations are currently underway. The house tax collection procedures have now been simplified so that taxpayers can pay anywhere without having to be designated to a specific area. The summer house tax was collected in July, and the clothing fees for the security corps and epidemic prevention funds were collected together, all for one season only. 2. Entertainment tax was reduced to 40% from August 1st. The banquet tax implements the official bill and hall register stamping method, first by having stores automatically declare and pay, and then conducting random checks and implementing on-site collection if there is any inaccuracy. 3. The central government originally stipulated that the land tax should be collected in kind. Because this city has more difficulties, it has been approved to collect it in legal tender. The originally stipulated amount of 9.2 dou (a unit of dry measure) is now being requested to be paid at 40% to show extra sympathy for the hardships of farmers. 5. Regarding the license tax, there is a dispute over the interpretation of the law for the business license tax, and there are also problems with the calculation standards. Repeated requests have been made to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. The license tax for use was originally based on the vehicle tax rate before the reform. Now, due to rising prices, it has been revised to collect five times the amount in the second half of the year. 6. The slaughter tax officially established a collection office in July to unify the collection in the urban and suburban areas.

Mr. Gu, when discussing the future of finance, stated that a sound financial system is based on a sound system on the one hand and a sound budget on the other.

The biggest shortcoming at present is that a sound financial system has never been established, and the distribution of tax revenue is still in an unreasonable state. Because over 70% of the income comes from banquet tax and entertainment tax, but this type of tax is a regulatory tax on behavior, the so-called "discouraging through taxation." The more effective the execution, the less the income, and the more difficult the collection, the higher the cost, and there are seasonal fluctuations. It is extremely unsuitable for long-term municipal construction projects. According to the previous concession era, 40% of the income was house tax, 30% was land tax, and over 10% was license tax. Taking the city tax revenue of the United States as an example, real estate tax accounts for over 92%. Therefore, house tax is the most reasonable, universal, and fair source of tax revenue. Currently, house tax revenue in this city only accounts for 4% in the first half of the year. In July and August, due to the increase in other types of tax revenue, it has been reduced to 2%. The land tax is still in the active preparation stage. The license tax, such as rickshaws, only collects 2,000 yuan per vehicle, and the total percentage is even smaller. This unreasonable phenomenon must be reformed.

The total amount of the estimated budget for the second half of the year is 84.7 billion yuan. At first glance, the numbers seem quite alarming, but if calculated at 5,000 times, it only amounts to over 16 million yuan before the war. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the total budget of the three administrative institutions in this city was over 47 million yuan. Therefore, compared, it cannot be considered high. The only question is whether the citizens have the ability to bear it. The current population is more than double that of before the war, although economic strength has been greatly reduced, but as long as each person bears 36% of the pre-war burden, the budget target can be achieved. As for how to open up new sources of tax revenue, four proposals have been submitted this time. If only maintaining the current state of the municipal government's work is to be satisfied, then an increase of 3.5 billion yuan per month is required to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. If we go a step further and hope that the municipal government can carry out construction and truly run Shanghai well, then an increase of 6 billion yuan per month is required. In short, I hope that the council can review in detail to achieve a reasonable result. In addition, regarding enhancing work efficiency, I have always been law-abiding and set an example. If subordinates have illegal behavior, I hope they will be reported at any time with their names.

### Finance Bureau Director Answers Questions

The main content and Director Gu's answers to the oral inquiries made to the Finance Bureau Director by Ji Hao, Gong Xia, Tao Baichuan, Li Wenjie, and other nine people are summarized as follows:

(1) Question: How can the situation of evasion of banquet tax be improved? Answer: Frankly speaking, it is difficult to investigate. The best way is to hope that citizens must obtain invoices from restaurants after dining. On the one hand, severely punish those who are found to be evading taxes. Punish them once for the total sales amount of one day. Alternatively, use the method of sending people to sit and check, and calculate the monthly tax amount based on the sales amount for two to three days.

(2) Question: What is the standard for house tax collection? It seems to be too high and encourages landlords to increase rents? Answer: The current house tax continues to use the standard of the Public Works Department and is collected at twice the amount. The Public Works Department investigated the standard for collecting house rent very thoroughly based on various factors. As for the house tax exceeding the rent, this is because the current fixed rent method is used, which will not have an impact.

(3) Question: The starting point for the banquet tax is indeed too low. Can the Finance Bureau raise it? Answer: Several dozens of civilian cafeterias are currently exempt from banquet tax. In addition, it is stipulated that set meals are not taxed. The price of a set meal was originally set at 1,300 yuan, and it is now planned to be raised to 1,440 yuan. The catering industry, on the other hand, has requested an increase to 1,600 yuan, which is currently under consideration.

(4) Question: What is the situation of revenue and expenditure for the Baojia (mutual security system)? Answer: The total revenue is over 300 million yuan, and over 270 million yuan has been spent. It is currently temporarily stored by this bureau.

In addition, Tao Baichuan's question was more in the nature of a suggestion. He believes that the review of the municipal government's budget for the second half of the year will be one of the most important tasks of the council and must be approached cautiously and rigorously. He advocates that all councilors should first conduct a review of principles, and then hand it over to a subcommittee for detailed study. Li Wenjie echoed his opinion and hoped that the municipal government would report in detail the policy guidelines and work plans for the second half of the year. Director Gu believes that these two suggestions are very valuable and stated that if the assembly implements a review of principles, he is willing to attend and listen to explain and supplement.

Tao Baichuan, who has been the most enthusiastic in questioning these days.

### Most Councilors Oppose the Issue of Restoring Horse Racing

[This newspaper report] In order to make up for financial revenue, the municipal government of this city submitted a motion to the Municipal Council through the mayor, proposing to open the horse racing track on Nanjing Road in this city and restore horse racing to increase tax revenue. Before this case was formally submitted to the assembly for discussion, the councilors had already expressed their objections one after another. According to inquiries from reporters to several councilors, the opinions varied, but according to a certain councilor, 80 to 90 percent of all councilors expressed opposition to this point.

The councilors Zhao Dihua, Zhao Junhao, Zhou Feicheng, Lu Huimin, Zhang Zhongyuan, etc., who opposed horse racing, put forward roughly the same reasons, stating that horse racing has a tendency to promote gambling. If horse racing can be held, then other similar gambling activities can follow suit. Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao suggested that the horse racing track be converted into a Shanghai Cultural City, which would include three parts: (1) the council site (because it is the highest body of public opinion), (2) cultural groups such as the Education Association, Journalists Association, Art Association, Library, Museum, Revolutionary History Exhibition Hall, etc., and (3) converting the racecourse into the Roosevelt Sports Field. It is heard that Councilors Feng and Zhao will submit a formal proposal to the assembly for discussion and will formulate methods for recovery.

Tong Daoyun's opinion is to convert the horse racing track into a gymnasium so that Shanghai has a large gathering place. At the same time, Jing'an Temple Road can directly connect to Ma Huo Road. Opening this road can also create another road, and traffic difficulties can be solved in part. Jin Hongxiang believes that horse racing has no relationship with productive enterprises. It seems unnecessary to hold it at a time when industry and commerce are in urgent need of development. Shen Ding said: The city's tax revenue relies entirely on banquet and entertainment taxes. Mayor Wu and Director Gu also believe that it is unsound and needs to be improved. If horse racing can increase tax revenue, then is this tax a sound tax? It is worth considering. Shi Zhifu said: Horse racing is not only similar to gambling, but the behind-the-scenes hosts, horse owners, and jockeys are inevitably linked in some cases. If horse tickets are sold and lottery tickets are drawn, there may be monopoly phenomena. Secondly, Shanghai has become the largest city in China, and horse racing in this prosperous area is somewhat inappropriate for the environment, but some of the buildings are worth preserving. Ma Junshuo stated that the horse racing track should be taken back as the site of the council and should not be held during this period of industrial and commercial decline. Tao Baichuan's opinion is: Two points must be studied first regarding this issue: (1) How to raise the 30 billion yuan shortfall in the budget for the second half of the year in Muben? (2) How much tax can be collected from horse racing, and how much help can it provide to municipal expenses? If the amount of the shortfall cannot be reduced, and the method of raising funds is to increase the burden on the general public, then it is better to have the rich bear the horse racing tax. But even so, I still don't approve of horse racing. The hall should be used for entertainment and cultural activities. I also don't approve of dog racing, because horse racing is not as time-consuming as dog racing, and gambling is the main business.

Regarding those who principally support it: Xu Xueyu put forward two points: (1) He does not oppose horse racing. Horse racing should not be regarded as gambling, but should be regarded as a sport. The location should be in the suburbs, and the time should be on holidays. (2) He does not approve of it being held at the horse racing track. The hall should be taken back as a public place. Luo Qinghua supports holding it in Jiangwan, and the original site should be converted into a sports field or a park. Yan Esheng said: Some businesses such as brothels can currently exist and pay taxes, so horse racing can also collect taxes and increase revenue. Shui Xiangyun and Zhu Fuju meant: Shanghai is an international city, and horse racing can also exercise the body. If it is not mainly for gambling, it may as well be held, but it should be set up in the suburbs.

### Nanjing Merchants Flee to Shanghai After Committing Crimes: Issuing Bad Checks One After Another, They Are Apprehended

[This newspaper report] Yang Limo (from Shaoxing), the general manager of the Jinling Leather Wallet Company in Nanjing's Confucius Temple, and Li Fengqi (from Wuxi), the deputy manager, founded the Jinling Department Store on July 1, with capital of 144 million yuan. They also opened a Shanghai branch at No. 33-34, Manfu Building, Hankou Road in this city. Due to its large scale, it attracted deposits of over 300 million yuan. On August 31, Yang and Li fled to Shanghai with the company's seals and private seals because they had issued bad checks and were unable to make up for them. At the same time, senior employees Wang Ruhui, Chen Jiafen, and Zhou Along also fled. Huang Yuzhi, the shareholder and assistant manager of the company, reported to the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters to send personnel to the company to move the goods and equipment. On the one hand, he sent personnel to come to Shanghai with Huang to investigate the whereabouts of Yang and Li. On the 9th, he reported to the Laozha Sub-bureau. Jiang Shangpei, the chief of the criminal section, ordered the police to search for information everywhere. He learned that Chen Jiafen was hiding at No. 63, Xieqiao Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and immediately went to the address to arrest Chen. Not long after, Zhou Along arrived and was captured as well. They were taken to the bureau for strict interrogation. However, they all denied knowing the whereabouts of Yang and Li. In order to catch them, the sub-bureau first allowed Chen and Zhou to be released on bail and set a time limit for investigating the whereabouts of Yang and Li. On the one hand, the police were sent to guard at No. 63, Xieqiao Lane. On the 10th, a phone call suddenly came, revealing that Yang was living at No. 1404, Disiwei Road, in the Xin Wuweizhai Dim Sum Shop. The bureau did not show any signs and waited until about 3:00 AM the next morning. Section member Feng Xiushan led the police to rush there. After knocking on the back door for a long time, the shop firmly refused to open. The police officers then lurked in the lane to observe their movements. After more than an hour, they caught sight of someone on the upper floor flipping over the Gao Tou Gang Yi (a high stool). Fearing that there was someone below, they tiptoed down and hid next to the stove in the kitchen. The police officers immediately stepped forward to arrest him, and learned that it was Yang. Yang also confessed that Li Fengqi and Pan were hiding at No. 15, Gengqing Lane, Xinzha Road. They continued to pursue and arrest them, and took them to the bureau for interrogation. They confessed without denial. Yesterday, the guarantor who guaranteed Zhou Along suddenly falsely claimed to the Laozha Police Bureau that Zhou had already committed suicide in anger because he could not find Yang and Li, and presented a handkerchief with a suicide note written in pencil on it. Upon receiving the report, the police bureau sent personnel to the guarantor's residence to investigate and saw that Zhou Along was still there. He was arrested again, and the handkerchief was presented to the case for verification.

### Corrupt and Neglectful Officials of the Land Administration Bureau Dismissed and Released on Bail Pending Trial; Director Zhu Ascends the Stage Three Times to Answer Inquiries; Impersonating a Township Representative, Zhou Songqian Sent to Court

After Director Zhu finished his report, the oral inquiries began. The questions posed by Councilor Tao Baichuan were the most heated and intense. Mr. Tao asked: According to reports, senior officials of the Land Administration Bureau are selling their positions and engaging in corruption, involving tens of millions of dollars. Many people are implicated. Has the Land Administration Bureau investigated this matter thoroughly, and what is the progress? Director Zhu replied that there were indeed cases of fraud. As early as April of this year, the Land Administration Bureau, in response to the request of the people of Gaoqiao District in Pudong, returned more than 600 mu of farmland that had been forcibly occupied by the enemy. At that time, the Land Administration Bureau decided to recover 20,000 yuan per mu, but the township representative in charge of the matter actually collected 80,000 yuan per mu. This person lived in Shanghai and falsely claimed to be a township representative. He has now been handed over to the court and is awaiting the court's decision. As for whether Land Administration Bureau officials are involved, it is still under investigation. As of now, there is no factual evidence. The responsible section chief has been dismissed and released on bail pending trial. However, Mr. Tao was not satisfied with the above reply and continued to inquire: Who was dismissed? Why was he dismissed? Why was he released on bail instead of being sent to court? Is it true that tens of millions of dollars were embezzled? Who else is involved? What is the progress of the investigation? Director Zhu replied: After the investigation, the person in charge should have been sent to court, but because no conclusive evidence was obtained, he was temporarily released on bail. Because the township representative was an imposter, the person in charge should be held responsible for negligence in failing to investigate, so he was dismissed. The case is currently under investigation by the court, and if the court believes it needs to be prosecuted, it will definitely be strictly handled. However, several councilors, including Lu Yinchu, were still not satisfied with the above supplementary reply and insisted that Director Zhu announce the names of the dismissed personnel and the amount of embezzlement. At this time, the atmosphere at the meeting became very tense, and Director Zhu ascended the stage three times to answer, saying: The dismissed section chief of the Land Administration Bureau is called Zhang Jiliang, the staff member is called Huang Qiren, and the person who impersonated the township representative is Zhou Songqian. As for the amount of embezzlement, it is still under investigation and cannot be reported, as it is not known how much money was collected from the farmers. This matter should originally be investigated by the court, but the Land Administration Bureau is also actively sending people to investigate, and once there are results, it will definitely be announced.

Other oral inquiries and Director Zhu's replies are briefly described below. Zhang Zhongyuan asked to whom does the property rights of the Racecourse belong, and what is the nationality of the owner? Director Zhu replied: The situation of the Racecourse is being investigated by the Finance Bureau, but the Land Administration Bureau also knows a little about it. The Racecourse has a long history and covers an area of more than 500 mu. The racetrack and the surrounding 100 mu belong to the Racecourse Association. About 400 mu inside the racetrack belong to the Sports Association. There is also a small portion of private property and tombs. As for the property rights of the Racecourse, they have not been registered and belong to the "Dao Qi" (an old kind of land deed). However, the government also has the right to requisition it if it wants to, because the Racecourse only has the right to lease and does not have ownership.

Regarding the issue of re-evaluating land prices, the central government has already issued a complete regulation. It is decided by the Evaluation Committee. The land appreciation tax is determined according to the price index. Because the increase in land prices is actually the result of the depreciation of the legal currency, not the appreciation of the land itself, it would be unreasonable to levy the land appreciation tax. Therefore, before the currency system is stable, the collection will be postponed. Unless someone buys it for 60 million today and sells it for 70 million tomorrow, then the land appreciation tax will be levied. Land illegally disposed of by puppet organizations is invalid, even if it is purchased in good faith. This is stipulated by central laws. However, we are currently requesting instructions from the central government to see if there are any other compensation measures.

Regarding the handling of real estate by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, there is always contact with the Land Administration Bureau, and a small group has been formed in conjunction with the Central Trust Bureau to consult with each other. The Housing Management Committee is jointly organized by the Provisional Council, the Court, the Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Garrison Command, and the relevant bureaus of the Municipal Government. A total of more than 3,600 cases have been received, and more than 1,800 cases have been mediated. It can be said that considerable achievements have been made. In addition to mediation, rental rates have also been assessed. Currently, new rules are being submitted for approval to grant the Housing Management Committee the power of adjudication. As for banning key money, although it is an established policy, it is an economic problem and cannot be fundamentally solved by political forces. Regarding the "land price appraisal from price tax," although it is Sun Yat-sen's will, the Legislative Yuan has added land valuation methods to supplement it. How to enable tillers to own their land is being planned and drafted by the central government.

### Zhang Wei Prepares to Secretly Visit Night Soil Boats; Zhu Ping is Questioned to Get to the Bottom of Things; Highlights from the Meeting

More and more councilors are arriving late. Yesterday afternoon at three o'clock, there were very few people in the meeting place. When the meeting was announced at a quarter past three, there were only 96 people signed in.

The original brewed tea, one cup per guest, was changed to ordinary black tea the day before yesterday afternoon, and yesterday it was restored to the original brewed tea.

Yesterday morning, when discussing whether to participate in the investigation team, Tao Baichuan sometimes put his fountain pen in his nostril and sometimes took it out to write quickly.

Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan wore a navy blue top and white canvas trousers, looking very refined. When reporting, he called himself "Chunfan," but the last time, he called himself "this member."

Director Gu's Suzhou dialect was still clear and crisp, but when explaining the banquet tax, when he said "eat at a restaurant," the "eat" sounded like "go to court."

When answering inquiries, Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei mentioned that some night soil boats dump the night soil in the Huangpu River halfway. He said, "I am preparing to disguise myself and investigate."

Director Zhang also said: "The charging standards in hospitals depend on the patient's identity. Wealthy people are not happy if the fees are too low."

Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping was asked to come to the stage three times to explain the bureau's corruption case. In the end, he was forced to reveal the names of the corrupt officials, which looked quite embarrassing.

Starting yesterday, it was stipulated that councilors must speak at the microphone on the podium when making oral inquiries, and this was strictly enforced. One time, Tao Baichuan stood up and said, "I have a simple opinion. Can I express it from my seat?" In the end, Zhu Neng got his wish.

When councilors go to the podium to speak, they put on their coats. After speaking, they return to their seats and take them off, which is quite busy.

The afternoon meeting was extended twice, the first time by half an hour, and the second time by another 20 minutes. Acting Chairman Xu Jilao said, "It cannot exceed one minute more," but as a result, Director Gu answered inquiries until six o'clock before stopping. Director Pang Jing of the Health Bureau put on his coat and left first.

### Flood Prevention Projects in This City are Being Actively Implemented in Various Districts; Clearing Ditches and Pipes to Improve Drainage Efficiency; Dredging Rivers and Harbors to Open More Drainage Outlets

[This newspaper] At 1:30 p.m. yesterday, the Public Works Bureau hosted the local press in the Municipal Government's conference room. Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, Director Xu Yifang of the Drainage Engineering Department, Deputy Director Yu Haoming, Chief Engineer Gu Kangle, Specialist Qian Weifan, and Director Zhu Xubai of the Municipal Government's Information Office attended, along with more than 50 reporters from various newspapers. Director Zhao first reported on the bureau's general work and three major problems: 1. Flood prevention; 2. Construction of affordable housing; 3. Connecting the north-south trunk roads. The main difficulty with the first two problems lies in the shortage of funds. The difficulty with the third problem is based on the fact that before the war, the city was divided into three spheres of influence (the former British and French Concessions and the Municipal Government). While east-west traffic is very smooth, north-south traffic is blocked. Therefore, according to the Public Works Bureau's plan, it was originally intended to widen Xizang Road and Zhejiang Road, but there were many objections to demolishing the houses along the road, which prevented the plan from being implemented.

Waterlogging Problem Long Unresolved

After Director Zhao finished his report, Director Xu Yifang of the Drainage Engineering Department reported on the detailed situation of the current flood control on the roads. He said that the waterlogging problem has always been a serious problem in Shanghai. The former British Concession authorities had made some efforts, but failed to solve it. After the Public Works Bureau took over, it is feared that it will not be able to find a thorough solution in two or three years. After discussion by the bureau's engineers, it was believed that the main causes of waterlogging are: (1) The diameter of the drains is too small, resulting in slow flow and easy siltation. (2) The terrain of the city is too low, and the outlets of the rainwater drains either have no tide gates, or the tide gates are damaged, causing tidal water to backflow and flood the road surface. (3) The rivers and harbors at the outlets of the rainwater drains have not been dredged, and the construction of houses in western Shanghai during the enemy and puppet period lacked management, filling in the river channels and hindering the discharge of rainwater. (4) Citizens are not aware of public health and dump garbage into the rivers and harbors, which easily causes siltation.

Flood Prevention Measures Target the Root Cause

After understanding the causes of waterlogging, the Public Works Bureau decided to take targeted flood prevention measures. In recent years, the work has focused on the following: (A) Clearing drains and pipes to improve drainage efficiency. (B) Dredging rivers and harbors to facilitate discharge. (C) Reconstructing and enlarging bottleneck drains to smooth the water flow. (D) Repairing tide gates, dams, and pumping stations to prevent tidal backflow and pump out rainwater. (E) Raising particularly low road surfaces to prevent rainwater from flowing down the road surface and pooling. (F) Opening more drainage outlets and significantly enlarging them to increase drainage capacity. The above flood prevention projects are all being actively carried out.

90% of West Shanghai's Rivers and Harbors Completed

Currently, 97% of the rivers and harbors in the western Shanghai area have been completed. Only a section near Dapu Bridge remains, which is being excavated with a dredger and will be completed within two weeks. In addition, the motive for repairing tide gates, dams, and pumping stations is that the city's terrain is low-lying. To prevent tidal backflow from overflowing the road surface, tide gates or sluice gates were originally installed, but due to years of disrepair, they leaked severely. A total of 164 tide gates have been rebuilt and completed. The purpose of the sluice gate and pumping station project is to prevent tidal backflow. During heavy rains, the pumps are also activated to pump out rainwater. Currently, three pumping stations are under construction: the Jiahama River, the Rihui Port, and the Caojiadu No. 1 River at the entrance to the Suzhou River, each pumping 60,000 gallons of water per minute.

Road Surface Raised, No More Waterlogging

In addition, the section of Kangding Road west of Yanping Road in the city has a particularly low-lying terrain. After the road surface was raised, there is no more waterlogging. Currently, the sections of Fanyu Road are being raised. The above flood prevention work has proven its effectiveness after the rainstorm on the evening of August 31. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the rainfall that day was the highest in the past 15 years, but the degree of waterlogging was not very serious, and the water receded relatively quickly.

Director Xu concluded: Drainage engineering is to the city as the foundation is to a house, because it has a great impact on transportation and sanitation. Due to the limitations of the city's terrain and the current state of the drainage system, it is truly a long-term and arduous task, but the Public Works Bureau will definitely go all out.

### Wen Lantina Case to be Announced This Morning

[This newspaper] It is heard that the High Court concluded the case of Wen Lantina's suspected treason on the 5th of this month, and the verdict will be announced this morning at 9:30 in the Criminal Division One of the High Court in Tilanqiao.

In addition, the cases of Liu Xun, the puppet captain of the Wu Xing County Security Brigade, Wu Binglin, the puppet Baozhang (local leader), Gui Ronghai, the translator for the enemy gendarmerie, and Gao A'er, the foreman, who are suspected of being traitors, will also be announced at the same time.

High Court Tried Many Cases Yesterday

[This newspaper] Zhang Jinzhang, who once served as the deputy chairman of the puppet Shanghai Gaoqiao Town Maintenance Association, was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being a traitor. The High Court concluded the trial yesterday and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 17th of this month. In addition, Lu Falang, the translator for the enemy gendarmerie, will also be sentenced on the same day.

Gu Huanzhang, the owner of the Xiang Sheng Leather Factory in this city, was arrested after the victory because he served as the chairman of the puppet Shanghai Leather Industry Association during the enemy and puppet occupation period. After the High Court concluded the trial, the verdict was originally scheduled to be announced yesterday morning, but because evidence was still needed for investigation, it was ordered to reopen the debate.

Le Jiajun, an investigator of the Fifth Section of the puppet Shanghai Economic Bureau, was accused of extorting 40,000 yuan in puppet currency from the Yi Chang Silk Store on Shanxi Road in this city while in office, together with Luo Jinghe, the puppet section chief. After the victory, he was reported by someone and sentenced to five years in prison by the High Court. The defendant refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court in Nanjing, which ordered a retrial. The defendant claimed that the 40,000 yuan was not extorted but was a festival gift voluntarily offered by the store. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court reopened the trial and summoned Zhang Zhichang to testify. The case was adjourned for retrial.

In addition, Hu Guangrong, a detective from the puppet Shanghai West Hongkou Police Station, abused his power and extorted money. Yesterday, Yang Hongshi and others were summoned to court to testify. Ren Musheng, Lin Zeyuan, Li Xiangsheng, Li Zhetang, and Wang Runhe, intelligence officers of the enemy gendarmerie, jointly framed innocent people. Zeng Zhangshi, Li Yangshi, and Ren Xiongshi were summoned to court to inquire. In addition, the defendant in the Shen Wenda case did not appear. After investigation in the Jin Yulin case, all the above cases were ordered to be retried at a later date.

### The Subsidence Phenomenon in Shanghai is Nothing to Worry About

[This newspaper] Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau said at yesterday's press conference that when he took office, Mr. Clark, the former director of the Public Works Department of the former Municipal Council, told him that Shanghai has a subsidence phenomenon. According to geographical trends, coastal land is prone to this phenomenon, which is not dangerous. The direct impact on citizens is the waterlogging problem. As for the subsidence of skyscrapers such as the Park Hotel, it is also due to the city's geological conditions. If the subsidence is even, there is nothing to worry about.

### The Estates of Three Traitors to be Auctioned Off

[This newspaper] The entire estates of Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, and Miao Bin, three traitors, have been transferred by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau to the Central Trust Bureau. They will be publicly auctioned off after clearing, valuation, and sorting. As for the hidden properties of the three traitors, the Administration Bureau's traitor property team is actively continuing the investigation and will issue a public notice in the near future to encourage confidential reports and denunciations. The confidential reporting method is the same as before. However, since the three traitors are executed criminals, their hidden properties will be auctioned off immediately after they are found. The confidential reporting bonus (10% of the total value) can also be received immediately.

### Street Vendors on Avenue Pétain (now Jinan Road) Are Also Being Eliminated; Vendors Request Preservation from the Municipal Government and Police Bureau

[This newspaper] Jinan Road (formerly Avenue Pétain) in this city has always been a famous concentration of street vendors, with more than 200 stalls selling furniture and household goods. Some vendors have been setting up stalls there since the early years of the Republic of China. Recently, the Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to eliminate street vendors throughout the city, and Avenue Pétain was also affected. The vendors there believe that Avenue Pétain is not a major transportation route, no cars ever pass through it, and the rickshaws and handcarts that come and go are all customers who buy goods, so they do not hinder traffic. Moreover, because it is located in a remote area, there are very few pedestrians, so it does not affect the city's appearance. Furthermore, the goods sold by the vendors are furniture and miscellaneous items, not general "American goods," and there are no smuggled goods. Therefore, they have submitted a document to the Municipal Government Police Bureau requesting the preservation of the stalls on this road.

### Elimination is Determined; Vendors' Petition is in Vain

[This newspaper] According to the Municipal Police Bureau, the elimination of street vendors must be thoroughly implemented, because the mayor is very determined on this matter. Therefore, the vendors' petition to the mayor the other day, requesting a concentrated area and continued permission to operate, is purely a waste of time, because the elimination is an established policy of the Municipal Government and will absolutely not be changed due to collective petitions.

### Jiang Tingfu's Talk of Resignation Formally Denied by UNRRA

[This newspaper] Director Jiang Tingfu of the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) has been resting at home due to illness since hosting a review meeting on UNRRA's work in Nanjing a few days ago. According to the doctor, Mr. Jiang needs to continue to rest for a few more days before he can go to the office. During the review meeting, Mr. Jiang made a very frank statement when mentioning the criticisms of UNRRA from various parties, saying, "In order to seek their own interests, the shipping companies in our country do not hesitate to disregard the millions of starving refugees. This is one of the most disappointing events of this year." Mr. Jiang also reiterated that the 432 billion yuan in disaster relief funds allocated by the government is based on UNRRA's budget, but UNRRA has not received a penny so far, and all expenses still have to rely on loans and the sale of materials. Mr. Jiang also expressed his willingness to resign in order to go to the United States to lecture. Recently, there have been rumors in the city about Mr. Jiang's talk of resignation, which may be related to his words. Yesterday afternoon, a UNRRA spokesman formally denied this, but the general public is still watching closely.

### Good News for Public School Employees: Meal Boxes Begin Distribution; Edible Even If Moldy

It is learned that the Municipal Distribution Office for Public School Employees has decided that the first distribution of goods will be KD meal boxes, each with a value of 9,000 yuan. These samples have been displayed at 200 Fuzhou Road. The K-style meal box includes eight or nine kinds of food. The D-style meal box is mainly chocolate, and its components include seven nutrients such as milk, oatmeal, and vitamin B. They are all the most nutritious rations jointly supplied to the US military by various American factories. The second phase of distributed items is cotton cloth, which has been approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau for the 128th time. The price has also been determined and is cheaper than the market price. Four people share one bolt. According to the person in charge of the office, the 20 printed flower tickets attached to the purchase certificate, the red "Tian" tickets, are specifically for purchasing KD meal boxes and must be purchased with a ticket. The "Di" tickets are specifically for distributing cotton cloth. Those who receive these printed flower tickets should keep them safe. If they are lost, they will not be reissued. It is also learned that the office has a contract with the Materials Supply Bureau. All daily necessities that can be supplied to public school employees will be allocated by the office as much as possible. In order to facilitate public school employees to select and purchase items, the office will establish a retail department and purchase a variety of daily necessities from the Supply Bureau, and distribute one type of printed flower ticket per month. It is also learned that there may be a very small number of moldy D-type meal boxes in the first distribution. The office sent them to the Health and Chemical Testing Institute for inspection, and it was reported that the moldy D-type meal boxes can still be eaten after boiling. It is hoped that recipients will pay attention. Group A will begin distribution today.

### Haiyue Wheel Already Out of Danger; Haixia Wheel to Sail to Hankou Again

[This newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyue Wheel encountered wind on the Haikou sea off Hainan Island last Sunday and was in danger. According to news from the bureau yesterday, the typhoon in Hainan Island has dissipated, and the Haiyue Wheel has also escaped danger. It is heard that the ship suffered heavy losses, with two anchors lost and the hull damaged. There was slight water ingress in each cabin. Efforts are now being made to seal the flooded areas, and it is planned to sail to Hong Kong for repairs. In addition, the company's Haixia Wheel, which has been under repair for several months to add passenger seats, has now been completed and is scheduled to sail to Keelung next week. It is heard that the ship must carry several technical personnel from the National Resources Commission to Okinawa. Therefore, for the first voyage, it will first go to Okinawa and then sail to Keelung. The Haixia Wheel, which was assigned to the Philippine route, once sailed to Tianjin. After returning to Shanghai a few days ago, it prepared all the procedures for going to the Philippines. It was learned yesterday that public school employees from North China in Shanghai urgently want to return north. In order to take care of the public school employees, the bureau ordered the Haixia Wheel to sail to Tianjin again on the 14th. The next time, it will be decided to sail to the Philippines.

Strike Affects Ships Returning to the United States

[This newspaper] The American seafarers' strike has a significant impact. The SS General Heintzelman, an American President Lines ship, is scheduled to leave Shanghai today to return to the United States but will not stop at San Francisco for the time being. The Fenwick Reeve, managed by Shuntong Shipping Company, will also leave the dock today and sail to New York, without stopping at San Francisco. In addition, the SS Kina, managed by Danish merchant Bao Long Yanghang, was originally scheduled to sail to the United States in the coming days. Due to the American seafarers' strike, the ship will no longer sail to the United States and will return to Europe.

### Tong Shida Expresses: Train Tickets Will Definitely Not Increase in Price

[This newspaper] Tong Shida, the station master of Shanghai North Station, told reporters yesterday that although postal rates have been partially adjusted after the exchange rate adjustment, train ticket prices will definitely not increase. It has been just one year since the North Station was taken over. The first three months were the most difficult, but now it is gradually getting on track. Only the number of vehicles is insufficient. There is no shortage of coal for trains at present. There are also plans to restore the South Station, but it is feared that it will be difficult to realize in the short term. As for the locomotives transported by UNRRA, they require diesel. If they are to be used, oil pools must be added to each station, so they cannot be used.

### Great American Radio Obeys Our Laws; Will Automatically Close or be Operated by Chinese

[This newspaper] Since the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was ordered to ban illegally established radio stations in this city, all sectors have been concerned about the disposal of foreign radio stations in this city. The reporter visited Mr. Yu Bingjian, the director of the Telecommunications Bureau, yesterday and inquired about this matter. According to him, the American radio station XMHA has sent personnel to the bureau to express its willingness to obey the laws of our government and will automatically stop broadcasting if necessary. The Great American Radio Station played a significant role in our country's resistance against Japan after the Japanese occupied this city, relying on the protection of the old concession. It is heard that there is a plan to have the radio station sold and operated by Chinese. As for other radio stations such as the Soviet Broadcasting Station, although they have been notified, a decision on their disposal must be made after the Ministry of Communications consults with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and goes through diplomatic procedures.

### More Than 200 Newspapers and Periodicals Approved for Registration in This City

[This newspaper] The creation and re-publication of newspapers, magazines, and news agencies must be submitted to the central government for approval and registration and given a certificate before they can be issued. More than 200 newspapers and periodicals in this city have applied for registration and been approved by the central government, and have been notified by the Social Affairs Bureau. In the future, if newspapers and periodicals do not apply for registration and issue them without authorization, the competent authorities will strictly ban them.

It is hoped that readers in this area will arrive on time to receive their gifts.

### Using Counterfeit Money, Resulting in Prosecution

Claiming Ignorance During Trial

[This newspaper] The District Court opened a trial yesterday morning for a case of using counterfeit money. On July 20 of this year, a customer came to the Fang Zijin Gold Store at 659 Dongchangzhi Road to buy two gold bracelets. Yue Junting, a staff member of the store, negotiated with the customer. The customer paid 300,000 yuan in new banknotes and 200,000 yuan in banknotes of other versions from the Central Bank. Afterwards, the store discovered that the 300,000 yuan in new banknotes was counterfeit, but did not report it to the police for destruction. Instead, Yue took 80,000 yuan of it to Ningbo for use, and the remaining 220,000 yuan was kept in the store for mixed use. On the 23rd of the same month, Shu Zhangshi, a woman from Ningbo living at 81 Tongchun Lane, Gongping Road, came to redeem gold jewelry worth a total of 153,500 yuan. The store paid her 150,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes and another 3,500 yuan. Because Shu Zhangshi owed Zhu Deyu, who lived at 4 Lane 252 Huishan Road, 150,000 yuan, she paid the counterfeit banknotes to Zhu. Zhu deposited 100,000 yuan of it into the Juxingcheng Bank and 50,000 yuan into the Baohua Money Exchange on Tianjin Road. The money exchange discovered it and returned it. Zhu negotiated with Shu Zhangshi and went to the Fang Zijin Gold Store to question them. While they were arguing, they were discovered by the police on the road, who took them to the police station and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation. It was believed that Yue Junting had intentionally used counterfeit money, and that Shu Zhangshi and Zhu Deyu had paid out all the money after receiving it, and were suspected of knowing that it was counterfeit money and using it to avoid losses. Therefore, they were prosecuted together according to law. During the trial yesterday, all the defendants claimed that they did not know it was counterfeit money and hired lawyers to defend them. After the judge questioned them, he ordered a retrial at a later date.

### Affected by the War in Northern Jiangsu, Half of the Pig Dealers Closed Down; Current Arrivals for Lending Have Greatly Decreased, Relying Only on Xuzhou and Zhang Huang Port, Ren Port and a Few Other Places

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The source of fresh pigs in this city, with its largest producing area in Huaiyin, Northern Jiangsu, etc., since the goods from Huaiyin were interrupted due to the war, the new port of Jiangbei County, which was originally an export area for fresh pigs, has also recently been obstructed by the Communist army's extortion and harassment. Therefore, the arrival of goods in Shanghai has gradually become scarce. Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Xin Xiaokang, Hong Wenjiang, Xu Yunquan and other business leaders of the pig industry. According to them, the current prospects of the industry are becoming increasingly bleak and the situation is very serious. If this continues, there may be a total collapse. The trade association originally had more than 70 member firms, but due to the impact of the war in northern Jiangsu, by the Mid-Autumn Festival, Dayuan, Tongchang, Tianxin, Yifeng, and Juda and others have closed down and liquidated. Rentai, Baoxing, Wanda, Shengcheng, Sanhe Heji, Tongtai, and Shengyuan Yihe and others have temporarily suspended operations. In addition, there are also many who have not stopped operating but have no goods to supply the market. Therefore, the current actual number of members is only more than 30. The reasons are: (1) The source is cut off due to the war in northern Jiangsu, (2) Losses due to high interest rates, (3) If the loan for pigs is obstructed midway, they refuse to repay it on the pretext, (4) Frequent inspections by military police along the way cause delays, and the death of pigs also makes the dealers hesitate. Recently, fresh pigs have been transported by land from Bengbu to Shanghai by train from Nanjing, with a slight arrival of goods. In terms of waterways, only a small number of pig boats from Zhang Huang Port and Ren Port, two small ports in Jiangbei, have arrived to supply the market, maintaining the meat consumption of millions of people in Shanghai. We are now trying our best to reduce obstacles and unblock the source, in order to make a final struggle and reverse the decline.

### Suspected of Theft by a Staff Member of the New New Company

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The New Cheng Police Sub-bureau received a tip-off on the 8th, saying that goods of unknown origin were hidden at No. 17, Lane 52, Huangpo Road. Song Bingzheng, the chief of the Criminal Division, ordered police chief Jiang Run and others to drive to investigate. According to the second landlord of the house, the front building where the goods were placed was rented by Wan Qiting (from Qidong, 32 years old), who lived at No. 13 in this lane. Wan worked in the hardware department of the New New Company. The investigating police officer immediately went to the New New Company to meet Manager Xiao and explained the purpose of the visit. Manager Xiao summoned Wan to the scene and took him to the bureau for interrogation. According to Wan's confession, his colleagues in the company organized a Xin Yuan Company in 1933, and all goods had invoices. However, after careful examination of the invoices, most of them were filled out by Wan himself. The rest of the invoices had no business registration proof. Also, a suitcase was deposited by a friend, who claimed that it was all clothes. However, after opening it, it was found to contain more than a dozen pieces of silk fabric, towels, socks, and other items. The sub-bureau preliminarily determined that there was a suspicion of theft, and applied to the District Prosecutor's Office for a seven-day detention to continue the investigation.

### 30,000 Overseas Chinese in Hawaii, Most of Whom Have Thriving Careers and High Status; There are Also Overseas Chinese Councilors in the Provincial Assembly; A Brief Talk by Mei Jingzhou, Consul General in Honolulu

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, I met Mr. Mei Jingzhou, the Consul General in Honolulu, who had recently returned to China. Because Mr. Mei has always been in Hawaii, my first question was: "Was Mr. Mei in Honolulu when the Pearl Harbor Incident happened?"

Mr. Mei waved his fan and said with a smile: "The Pearl Harbor Incident? I almost lost my life in this bombing!" He then told me that before the Pearl Harbor Incident, the sky over Honolulu had been filled with many American planes constantly flying around, busy with various air combat exercises. So when Japanese planes entered the sky, everyone thought they were American planes. Even when Pearl Harbor was bombed, everyone didn't know. It wasn't until they saw the big headlines on the extra that they knew that Japan had started. There were very few Japanese planes bombing in Honolulu, so the losses were relatively minor. However, an incendiary bomb exploded only 300 feet away from the Chinese Consulate. Fortunately, it landed in the woods, so there were no casualties. But the original intention of the Japanese planes was probably to deliberately bomb the Chinese Consulate. Speaking of this, Mr. Mei laughed: "Because they really hate me. I have always been dedicated to refuting the absurd and arrogant remarks of the Japanese. My name has long been on the blacklist in Tokyo."

I said, "What was the situation of the American military's preparations at that time?"

Mr. Mei's answer was: The Americans did have preparations, but they didn't expect the Japanese to act so quickly. Among the six islands of Hawaii, the total number of Japanese residents was 150,000, accounting for nearly 40% of the total population of 500,000. The Japanese consulate employed more than 100 special agents. Various information about the American military in the Hawaiian Islands had already been collected in great detail, so the bombing targets were quite accurate. In contrast, American counterintelligence work was somewhat inferior.

As for the number of overseas Chinese in Hawaii, Mr. Mei said that there were about 30,000 in total, of which 25,000 were born in Hawaii, so they had dual citizenship of both China and the United States. 80% of these 30,000 overseas Chinese are from Guangdong, especially from Zhongshan, Guangdong. Most of them have received higher education, and their businesses are very developed. They have a high reputation in the local area. There are now two banks run by overseas Chinese in Hawaii, and many trust companies. There are even more engaged in various other businesses.

The residents of Hawaii are now engaged in a movement to upgrade Hawaii's status from a "colony" to a "state." Although the plan to change to a "state" has not yet been realized, Hawaii already has its own provincial assembly. Among the overseas Chinese, there are two senators and six representatives in the provincial assembly. In the Honolulu city government, one overseas Chinese serves as an accountant, another serves as an auditor, and three overseas Chinese serve as councilors, all of whom are in quite important positions. In addition, there are 37 overseas Chinese doctors, 35 dentists, and 150 teachers (teaching in American schools). There are also two Chinese newspapers.

In mid-June of this year, several overseas Chinese in Hawaii jointly established Trans-Pacific Airline, which specializes in flying between the six major islands of Hawaii. When it was founded, the capital was only 500,000 US dollars, and there were only three or four twin-engine aircraft. But recently, in less than three months, the capital has increased to 10 million US dollars, and the number of aircraft has increased to 25, most of which are large four-engine passenger planes. Currently, Trans-Pacific Airline's passenger planes have eight flights every day. They very much hope to extend the routes to various ports in the motherland, but they don't know if the government will allow them to come. Mr. Mei said with emotion, "The efforts of these overseas Chinese are really admirable. If they can be allowed to assist in the development of China's air transport business, it will definitely make a great contribution to China. Although China now has several airlines, there are really still too few planes. Even for overseas Chinese who return home to visit relatives, they often don't have much difficulty taking a plane when they come back, but it is not easy to buy plane tickets when they want to go back to the United States. If we promote private aviation, we can encourage them to return to China for inspection and arouse their interest in investment."

Overseas Chinese did make great contributions during the Anti-Japanese War, and they were very enthusiastic in buying government bonds, donating money, and saving the country. However, the savings bonds have caused them considerable disappointment because the value of these bonds is now too low. But it is said that the government has now taken concrete steps to convert them into US dollars according to the exchange rate on the date when the overseas Chinese purchased the savings bonds, and then repay them according to the US dollar amount. Mr. Mei believes that this matter will definitely win the praise of many overseas Chinese, and, for the sake of the future, the government's doing so may not be a loss.

Mei Guang-sheng is from Taishan, Guangdong, and studied in the United States at an early age. During the European War, he served as the secretary of the Chinese Labor Youth Association in France. In 1929, he served as a member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1930, he served as the secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Cuba. In 1931, he served as the Consul in Havana, and in the same year, he was transferred to Honolulu as Consul. In 1934, he was promoted to Consul General in Honolulu, and has been in Honolulu for 15 years. Because he is extremely popular among the overseas Chinese, the overseas Chinese specially purchased land and donated a magnificent mansion for the Consulate General. During the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Mei was probably the one who most strongly criticized the Japanese invaders abroad. He recently plans to go to Guangzhou to see his relatives and old friends whom he has not seen for 17 years.

### Scientists Take on Important Tasks in China's Nation-Building Work, Said British Ambassador at Scientists' Weekend Forum Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Scientists' Weekend Forum was held at the World Society yesterday. Attendees included Li Shizeng, Pan Gongzhan, and Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, among others. British Ambassador Sir Steven was invited to attend. Li Shizeng delivered a speech first, stating that the person in charge of the association was originally Mr. Wu Zhihui, but due to his old age and slight discomfort, he could not attend. The connection between Chinese and British culture has a long history, and the fact that so many Chinese people can speak English today proves this. Cultural communication between countries is essential for mutual understanding on the road to peace. The outbreak of the recent war was based on this foundation, developing into an active anti-aggression movement. All parties assisted in the war, and the result was victory. It is hoped that this spirit will continue to be upheld and carried forward.

Now there is a New Treaty Foundation for Sino-British Friendship

Pan Gongzhan then spoke, saying: Shanghai is a major historical center for Sino-British cultural contact. I deeply know the importance of the Sino-British cultural connection, so even during the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting, I specifically asked for leave to attend. During the war, China and Britain fought side by side and finally won. Now, Sino-British friendship has a new foundation, and it will surely become more intimate in the future. The British Ambassador is new to China, and if there is an opportunity to travel to various places in the future, he will know that China is truly a country that loves friends. I believe the Ambassador will feel happy. Shanghai is an international city, and its future development still needs the assistance of friendly countries. Later, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei said: If Chinese and British students can exchange more with each other, it will definitely be more beneficial to the friendship between the two countries. Mr. Cai often discussed this matter with Wells and Shaw when he was alive.

Amidst applause from the entire audience, the British Ambassador stood up and said: After many years of war, China is now in the development stage, and it urgently needs the assistance of the best minds in its nation-building work. Scientists have a particularly important task in this great work. If they want to succeed in their efforts, I believe that all experts must contribute their knowledge and ideas. Therefore, I feel that this meeting will definitely have a significant impact on China's future science and technology.

International Exchange of Ideas Contributes Greatly to China

The Ambassador went on to comment on the importance of exchanging ideas with other countries, pointing out that such exchanges are beneficial to all parties involved. In this regard, Western countries can contribute a lot to China, especially in the latest developments in science, technology, and industry. During the war, Britain made amazing developments in technology and scientific methods. Britain and British scientists are eager to offer their knowledge to you and provide assistance. The Ambassador then mentioned the great efforts made by Dr. Needham and Chinese and British researchers during the war. They assisted Chinese scientists in the free areas of China during the long war against Japan. Although Dr. Needham has returned to the UK, British scientists are still willing to assist in China's nation-building work. The Ambassador also reminded the audience that the Sino-British Cultural Committee is actively carrying out its work. In addition to providing scientific equipment and scientific and engineering periodicals to Chinese academic institutions, the Ambassador knew that the committee is also eager to assist in the excellent work of Chinese scientists.

In conclusion, Ambassador Shi said: I dare to assure you that because the British have also suffered from the ravages of war, they can well understand the arduous task of economic and social recovery that China is currently facing. We know your difficulties and hereby wish you success.

Time differences as small as one-thirtieth of a billionth of a second can be accurately measured.

### The Executive Yuan Allocates Funds to Set Up a Primary School for the Children of its Employees

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing] The Sajiawan Jinchuanmen area is home to many agencies such as the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Food. After the restoration, there were many children of employees, but there was no primary school, which made it very inconvenient for children to attend school.

He said: The trend of government strengthening its control over economic activities is not necessarily a dangerous thing, "as long as the people retain the power to decide who is the person who makes the country successful, and change the organization of the country when they think it is appropriate." Dr. Pei Fei explained: "This means that we must have truly free choices, not pre-arranged elections. And truly free choices can only be realized with truly free criticism. Truly free choices have evolved into several things, which is the guarantee that the English-speaking people won in the first two revolutions. These things are freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of publication, whether in meetings, books, or newspapers. With these freedoms, we don't have to be afraid of the greater power of the state."

### Basketball Game - Liu Zhenyuan's Basketball Skills Seem Divinely Aided - The Air Force Team Beat Dahua Yesterday

Leading All the Way with a Score of 51 to 39

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Nanjing Air Force basketball team's second game in Shanghai was held at 8 pm last night at the City Sports Center against the Dahua team. There were more spectators than in the first game, as many Air Force personnel came to watch. They were all able to purchase tickets in accordance with the regulations, which is a virtue. As a result of the game, the Air Force won the first half with 27 to 17, and the overall result was 51 to 39. Watching the Air Force's performance, there has been more progress than in the first game.

Air Force Progress

The progress is mainly in three aspects: (1) The method of marking people is not as close as in the first game, which caused fouls. It can be said that they are now at a distance of one hand and one person from the enemy's basket. (2) The reduction of long shots means more time to maintain possession of the ball, so there are also more attacks under the basket. (3) They know how to consume time. In fact, with the electric clock next to them, any player can look at the time and deal with the corresponding offense and defense. Dahua played like a scattered sand, allowing the Air Force to exert its maximum. Overall, the Air Force has been able to know how to improve, and with its excellent personal skills, it will definitely achieve better results after the third game against the Shantou team.

Game Highlights

The referees were Jin Botao and Yi Hegao. After the start, the Air Force took advantage of Dahua's unfamiliarity and launched a desperate attack. Qin Xunze scored the first goal, and the momentum became even stronger. Liu Zhenyuan's shots seemed divinely aided. Near the basket, he went straight in and was successful every time. Dahua relied on Xu Wenkui's long shots and Yang Yuanlong's follow-up, trailing behind. But the difference was always four or five balls. In the first half, the visitors led with 29 to 19. The situation remained the same in the second half. Although there were frequent personnel changes on both sides, the situation remained the same until the end of the game. The visitors finally defeated Dahua with 51 to 39.

### Women's Volleyball Finals, Second Act: Wuben Meets Youlian

Tonight at 7:45 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium

[Our Reporter] As the women's and Group B volleyball teams enter the final stages of competition, each strong team is preparing themselves with full of energy. Today from 7 PM, there will be one Group B semi-final match and the second act of the women's group's round robin among the three strongest teams. In the Group B semi-final, Soviet Union B will face Shenguang. The winner will compete against Huayan Hua for the overall championship. In terms of strength, the Soviet Union team is generally more balanced than Shenguang. Shenguang's defense is not very good, especially in the third row second corner, which is vulnerable to strong attacks. Therefore, unless Shenguang's defense improves, they may be defeated.

In the second act of the women's group's round robin among the three strongest teams, Wuben will face Youlian. Youlian lost to their opponents in the first match, so they will strive to improve this time. In addition, they lost to Wuben in the last league match, so this is their chance for revenge. However, this reporter met Ling Qishen of Wuben yesterday, who said that because Shen Yuwen has returned to his hometown and Mu Duoyun is injured, they will continue to use veterans Zhang Biru and Li Po. With the team's familiarity, experience, and veteran players, they cannot be underestimated. It is reported that the team will wear new uniforms today, which will be a refreshing sight for the fans. The order of play today is as follows:

Shenguang - Soviet Union B (Group B Semi-Final) 7:00 PM
Wuben - Youlian (Women's Final) 7:45 PM

(Wuben) Front Row: Li Po, Wang Shan, Zhang Biru; Second Row: Zhang Minyu, Wang Wuli, Kuang Shaotao; Third Row: Xiao Jieying, Wang Jinfeng, Cheng Hongsheng.

### City Rechecks Census: Fourteen Regulations Stipulated, to Begin After Training of Household Registration Personnel Ends

The Municipal Government Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday sent a letter to each district office stating: "The date for the centralized training of household registration personnel in this city has been determined by this bureau, and we have sent a letter for your reference and compliance. The main purpose of this centralized training is to enable household registration personnel at all levels to understand household registration laws and regulations and to correctly process the initial household registration record. Therefore, household registration personnel at all levels should deeply understand this purpose, not be reluctant to receive training, and actively prepare for the record work. In addition to the previously issued 'Regulations on Matters to be Noted in Establishing Household Registration Books After the Household Census in Shanghai,' the following fourteen key points are hereby stipulated:

(1) It has been a long time since the household census was conducted in this city, and there have been many changes in the population. Therefore, a careful recheck of the population before recording is essential.

(2) The household recheck in each district shall begin three days after the end of the training. On the day after the end of the training, the district office shall supervise each Bao to separately convene Jia chiefs to instruct them on the recheck method and the requirements for filling out the forms. (The method for filling out the forms must follow the "Instructions for Filling Out Forms for the Household Recheck Before Household Registration and Recording" compiled by the Second Section of this bureau).

(3) The household recheck work shall be carried out by the Bao chief and the staff of the Bao office, supervised by all the Jia chiefs, with the principle of completing it in one day, and no later than two days.

(4) The standard date for the household recheck in each district is stipulated as follows: A. September 17th for the 1st to 5th districts. B. September 24th for the 6th to 14th districts. C. September 29th for the 15th to 21st districts. D. October 3rd for the 22nd to 32nd districts.

(5) The household recheck shall be based on the actual household situation as of the standard date for the household recheck. The household census forms originally stored in the district office shall be used as the basis for the recheck.

(6) The initial household registration and recording shall still be handled centrally in the district office in accordance with the regulations. During the recording process, two people shall work as a team, one recording the household registration book and the floating population registration book, and the other recording the migration registration book and statistical slips.

(7) The household registration book and statistical slips shall be recorded based on the household census form corrected by the "standard date for the household recheck".

(8) If the information recorded on the household census form does not match the actual household situation during the household recheck, the household census form shall be corrected immediately. If there is an increase in the number of households, another household census form shall be filled out and inserted. If there is no blank census form, it can be replaced with a migration application form and still inserted into the household census form. If a household has moved out, it shall be cancelled on the original form, and there is no need to fill out a "List of Households Moving Out" or a "List of Corrections to the Household Recheck."

(9) After a household has been rechecked, regardless of whether there are any corrections or additions, the head of the household shall affix his/her name chop to the original seal of the head of the household to show caution.

(10) During the household recheck, the head of each household shall be notified that if there are any matters such as migration in, migration out, birth, marriage, divorce, adoption, recognition, or death after the recheck, an application for registration shall be made in accordance with the law.

(11) After the household recheck, the district office shall immediately supervise each Bao to carry out the recording and, at the same time, instruct the Jia chiefs to check whether there have been any changes in the household situation within each Jia and to urge each household to apply for various registrations at any time.

(12) After the household recheck, all application forms for various registrations shall be submitted by the Jia chiefs to the Bao office for verification and transfer on a daily basis. The original household census forms stored in this bureau shall be issued to each Jia for safekeeping and use when the duplicate of the household registration book is sent to the bureau.

(13) After the household recheck, the household census form before the recording and the household registration book, migration registration book, and floating population registration book after the recording must be kept absolutely accurate. Even during the recording period, the Jia and Bao chiefs shall transfer various application forms to the district office on a daily basis, and the director of the household registration section of the district office shall be responsible for supervising the staff of each Bao to register them on a daily basis. (Households that have already been recorded shall be registered in various registration books immediately, and households that have not yet been recorded shall be registered immediately after the recording).

(14) The initial household registration, recording, and statistical slip recording work shall be completed within one and a half months in principle. At most, it shall not exceed two months."

### Pre-War Orders: Fixed Clients Requesting Delivery According to Contracts, American Chamber of Commerce Expresses Its Attitude After Research

[Our Reporter] The Five Continents Trading Company in this city placed dozens of orders with American export firms and manufacturers on behalf of customers before the war. Due to the disruption of the war, the goods have not been delivered. Now that peace has returned and business is as usual, many customers are requesting delivery according to the contracts and are unwilling to take back their deposits. The company has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to write to the Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy to inquire about the handling of such matters and whether there are any formal methods for delivering goods according to the contracts. It is now known that the Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy has transferred the matter to the American Chamber of Commerce for research and reply. After careful consideration, the Chamber has stated its attitude towards pre-war contracts as follows:

### Responsibilities of the Seller to be Determined According to the Contract

(1) If the contract signed by the buyer and seller contains the customary clauses such as "Neither party shall be liable for unforeseen events, natural disasters, or man-made disasters," then the contract should be invalidated due to the outbreak of the war. However, if the buyer has prepaid a deposit and the goods are specified to be shipped from an American port, and the price includes freight and insurance, then the ownership of the goods has not been transferred to the buyer, and the latter can claim back the deposit, and the seller is responsible for returning it.

(2) If the buyer prepays the entire amount of the goods and the original contract stipulates delivery on board the ship, then regardless of whether the clause "Neither party shall be liable for unforeseen events, natural disasters, or man-made disasters" is included, the ownership of the goods has been transferred to the buyer. If the goods are still in the seller's possession during the war, the buyer may incur unnecessary or even total losses due to bearing storage fees and other expenses, or due to damage to the goods. Therefore, to avoid such losses, the seller may have an obligation to sell the goods at the best market price. However, the seller is only an unpaid agent and has only a slight duty to take care of the委托货品. Unless there is excessive negligence, he cannot be held liable. If the goods are sold at a good price, the seller becomes the custodian of the proceeds and should handle them in accordance with the US Government's Frozen Chinese Assets Amendment Act No. 8389. In addition, it should be noted whether the goods are manufactured specifically for the buyer, or arranged separately, with attached logos and packaging treatment. If there are no such logos or they cannot be identified, then ownership has not yet been transferred to the buyer. Even if the seller is responsible for the amount paid by the buyer, the amount should still be handled in accordance with the aforementioned Frozen Assets Act.

(3) If the contract does not contain the clause "Neither party shall be liable for unforeseen events, natural disasters, or man-made disasters," then the seller should fulfill the original contract. There is no express provision in the law that war invalidates all contracts between the people of enemy countries. As for the right to sue in accordance with the contract, it cannot be exercised temporarily. However, the statement that the original contract should be performed may only be limited to cases involving property rights at the time of the outbreak of the war. Generally speaking, contracts concluded by people from opposing countries are bound to involve mutual exchanges, which may lead to aiding the enemy, so they should be cancelled. As far as contracts between residents of Shanghai and the United States are concerned, since Shanghai was occupied by the enemy, local residents should be regarded as enemy nationals. Therefore, strictly speaking, the contracts between Shanghai importers and American sellers should be handled in the same way as contracts between enemy countries.

(4) If the contract in dispute does not involve goods, and the goods are lost in transit due to the outbreak of war after the seller delivers them to the transportation vehicle, then unless the buyer can prove that the seller was negligent in selecting the transportation vehicle, the losses incurred should be recovered from the goods insurer. As to whether compensation can be cancelled, it depends on whether the cargo was insured for war risk.

(5) According to our Chamber, we have read Mr. 克伍夫's book on law, in which the issue of international contracts arising from war (Chapters 19 to 21 of Volume 6) does not elaborate on the key points, but only comments on legal lawsuits between German and Allied merchants. If a lawsuit is filed due to a contract issue, the "Statute of Limitations" cannot be used as a defense. This law is invalid during wartime. The above sections are answered to your association members about resolving the pre-war contract New York questions.

### Rehearsal Procedures Not Yet Skilled, Stock Exchange Decides to Postpone Opening Auction, To Facilitate Brokers, Market Board Records Will Be Improved

[Our Reporter] The Stock Exchange continued its trading, settlement, and reconciliation procedures yesterday morning and afternoon. The morning rehearsal of trading went well because of the simpler nature. Due to the failure of the previous day, yesterday's rehearsal of settlement and reconciliation was conducted in groups. Each group consisted of twelve people, and Yang Yinpu, the assistant manager of the Stock Exchange, personally supervised the training. The process took only one and a half hours, and all accounts were reconciled. The Stock Exchange authorities believe that the rehearsal process has improved significantly compared to the previous day. It is reported that group rehearsals of settlement and reconciliation procedures will continue throughout the day yesterday to achieve proficiency. Brokers also reportedly feel the same way. Therefore, the scheduled opening auction date of the 12th will be postponed.

In addition, the Stock Exchange authorities have now decided to accept some suggestions from brokers and make improvements: (1) The distance between the eastern and western corridors and the blackboard is too great, and the handwriting is difficult to read. It has now been decided to double the size of the handwriting. The transaction price will be written temporarily, and the bid and ask prices may be added in the future if needed. (2) To facilitate brokers, blackboards will also be set up in each trading hub to display the transaction and bid and ask prices of each stock.

The Stock Exchange recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting instructions on two points: (1) Please promulgate the transaction tax collection methods as soon as possible. (2) Please provide instructions on the regulations for substitutes for margin deposits.

In addition, some of the 20 securities approved for listing are undergoing registration changes, and temporary receipts are being issued for the stocks. It is reported that the Stock Exchange, in consideration of the actual difficulties, has temporarily allowed the pre-arranged transfer of these temporary receipts.

### Listed Prices and Allotments Remain Unchanged, Cotton Yarn Sales Already Saturated, Yarn Numbers Applied For Either Not Allotted or Reduced by Half, All Processing Factories Allotted According to the Number Applied For

[Our Reporter] The yarn market yesterday was not as strong as before. In addition to the usual sales by the Textile and Construction Company, the private yarn mills' joint allotment association also dumped a large amount of cotton yarn. Customers were unable to absorb it due to continuous purchases in recent days, and the Guangdong merchants' buying appetite was temporarily saturated. The local yarn numbers reportedly had a universal opportunity to be allotted, and they were also waiting and watching. Therefore, the yarn prices in the early market only remained strong for 16-count yarn, which was as high as 20,000 yuan, and 10-count yarn was also firm. The rest all fell. 42-count Blue Phoenix, the Shanghai warehouse bill price was quoted at 2.38 million, but the Wusong pier bill was only trading at 2.33 million. 32-count Blue Phoenix, packaged at 1.69 million. 32-count Xiantao cone tube, 1.6 million. 20-count Blue Phoenix, then quoted at 1.34 million. The number of transactions was not enthusiastic. The Textile and Construction Company opened 24 types of 42-count and other brands yesterday, and the prices remained the same, but the number firms were not allotted at all. 42-count Sunlight was allotted to the knitting industry (from No. 241 to No. 303), 32-count Five-Star was allotted to dyeing and weaving, and 20-count Magpie was allotted to towels, underwear, dyeing and weaving, and handkerchiefs (from No. 1 to No. 240). The yarn allotted by the private yarn mills' joint allotment association did not specify prices when it was listed at 11:00 AM. General factory numbers said that yarn prices might need to be adjusted. In addition, after the private mills opened yarn, they had to advance funds for more than half a month before they could get the actual goods, so those who requested purchases were very few. After the private mills announced the allotment prices at 5:00 PM, 20-count Fengnian was still at 1.16 million, 20-count Colorful Ball 1.16 million, 32-count Blue Phoenix 1.56 million, and 42-count Blue Phoenix 1.9 million, for a total of 2,050 pieces. It was also reported that all processing factories that requested purchases were allotted according to the number applied for, while yarn numbers were allotted half the amount. According to people in the industry, if the Textile and Construction Company can implement this allotment method continuously without interruption, then the decline in yarn prices is inevitable.

(Cotton Cloth Allotment Too Small, Black Market Still Difficult to Eliminate) The cloth market was slightly flat yesterday. Blue V-character, because cotton cloth merchants from No. 1 to No. 149, only opened one package per house, and the rest were returned, so the market price still had those who added 6,000 to 6,500 yuan to collect. Serge old goods, has not been opened twice, the price is still standing at 63,000 yuan. The Textile and Construction Company's quoted price for 12-pound unbranded fine cloth fell by 500 yuan, and few cotton cloth numbers applied to purchase this product, because those who opened it last time mostly sold it at reduced prices and there was no profit to be made, so they were all at a loss. As for the Blue V-character cloth applied for by the dyeing and weaving factories, each factory was allotted 40 pieces, and the unbranded fine cloth was allotted according to the order. However, in general, the market is upward-looking, and if the Textile and Construction Company wants to eliminate the black market, it is still not enough to open the goods, because things are valued when they are scarce. Since there are few allotments, the black market is inevitable.

### Chinese Stocks Initially High, Then Low, Foreign Stocks Stagnant Throughout

The over-the-counter trading of Chinese stocks was slightly affected because the Stock Exchange could not resume trading quickly. After opening, it gradually fell back, initially high and then low, with small stocks being the most sluggish in the middle. However, it rebounded slightly near the close, and unpopular stocks were also passively dragged down slightly. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Meyer, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qin Xing, and other stocks fell by about half a percentage point. Among the less popular stocks, medium-sized stocks fell slightly, and small stocks rebounded by half a percentage point to one percentage point. The veteran stocks saw minimal gains and losses.

Foreign stocks continued to be weak, but there were not many transactions, and the process was stagnant. Except for Steel Industry and Xiangtai, the rest of the stocks all fell slightly, and the trend was difficult to change drastically. As a result, compared with the previous close, Xiangtai rose slightly, Steel Industry remained flat, and the rest all fell slightly.

### After Tianjin Banned Coal Exports, Prices for White Coal are Chaotic

Since the ban on exports of white coal blocks from Tianjin, arrivals have decreased sharply. Holders of goods treat them as treasures, and the quoted prices have risen frequently. However, because the quoted prices are too high, it is difficult for buyers to approach, so the entire market transaction is very idle.

### Bond Market Sentiment Fluctuates

The volume of public bond transactions increased sharply, and large investors' psychology fluctuated, entering and exiting frequently. The C-type unified bond immediately retreated to 2,100 yuan in the morning, and after opening, it fell as low as 2,040 yuan before rising together. It had risen to 2,230 yuan in the middle of the session, but near noon, it was liquidated by many parties and fell back to 2,050 yuan. It struggled around 2,150 yuan near the close. As a result, it fell by 200 yuan compared with the previous close. The A, B, and D types were the same, and the E-type unified bond fell by 100 yuan.

### Authorities Adopt Stabilization Policy, Food Crisis Has Passed, Taiwanese Rice Arrives in Force and No Longer Dependent on Foreign Rice

[Our Reporter] I interviewed Ji Mingqi, the section chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. According to him, the food crisis in this city has passed, and it will enter a better state in the future. Mayor Wu humbly stated at the Municipal Council the other day that the rice policy had failed, but in reality, he only meant that the promotion of brown rice policy had failed. The most serious period of the food crisis in this city was in late June. According to the survey on June 24, the city's rice industry only had 12,840 石 of rice in stock, which was estimated to only supply the city for a few days, and the source was extremely scarce. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau had no choice but to adopt a distribution policy to regulate it. In order to achieve universal supply, regardless of the size of the rice store, after being certified by the industry association, they could apply for distribution, with a limit of 10 bags. This was out of factual necessity. Afterwards, the source of foreign rice was open, and the rice ordered from other places also arrived at the port one after another. The amount of rice in the hands of the bureau was relatively abundant, so it issued a sales method. All rice numbers were allowed to apply freely. Supply was provided as much as possible, and the rice price was stabilized. From July 4 to September 4. The bureau sold a total of 82,014 石 and 9 斗 of various grains. According to Ji Section Chief, the current amount of rice in stock is extremely large and can be supplied without restriction. Regarding rice prices, the government hopes to cooperate with general prices, not to rise high, nor to fall sharply, because high rises affect people's livelihood, and sharp falls are harmful to the countryside. Mayor Wu has a principle of hoping that the medium rice price will not exceed 46,000 yuan. Ji Section Chief also said that Taiwan's rice production is very abundant, with three harvests a year. In addition to supplying Taiwan's people with food. A large amount can also be exported. If Taiwanese rice is imported into this city, then the people of this city will no longer have to rely on foreign rice for food. The first batch of Taiwanese rice arrived at the port today. In the future, it will also arrive in a steady stream. It is also learned that: if the rice source is smooth and the rice price is too low, the government also plans to buy it.

### Gold Price Rebounds, US Dollar Steady

Yesterday's raw gold was still stable. It opened at 2.143 million in the morning. After opening, it started from 2.146 million, and the situation was uncertain. It first retreated to 2.135 million, and the Central Bank distributed 116 bars at this price. After 10:00 AM, the situation eased, and it gradually rebounded to 2.15 million, with a slight pressure. Near noon, it retreated to 2.133 million again. Those with ample funds absorbed it slightly. At noon, it rebounded to above 2.15 million again. Then, after the transaction of the next day continued to rise to above 2.16 million, and then it settled slightly. As a result, it rebounded 23,000 compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold was 29,000, pure silver was flat, and silver yuan fell slightly. The shadow interest rate was not loose, and the interest rate ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 角.

The foreign currency US dollar was still stable. It opened at 3,420 yuan for sale in the morning. It retreated to 3,390 yuan in the middle. It was still stable between 3,400 yuan and 3,420 yuan at noon. There was a lack of special changes. It was still struggling in the original place in the afternoon. As a result, it had no honor or disgrace compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar initially flat and then stable. As a result, it also rose by 10 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rate was also the same. It was around 680 yuan at first, and it rose slightly to around 690 yuan near noon. Indian exchange rate was 830 yuan to 840 yuan at first, and then 820 yuan to 830 yuan. British exchange rate was 1,105 yuan for supply, and US exchange rate was around the listed price.

### City Chamber of Commerce Again Cables Request: Business Tax Collected Based on Tiered System; Flexible Provisions in Tax Law Originally Allow for Adjustment; Revision of Detailed Regulations Does Not Require Legislative Procedure

[Our Newspaper Report] The City Chamber of Commerce, regarding the matter of business tax being collected based on tiered system by industry, recently sent another cable to the Ministry of Finance with suggestions. The original cable stated roughly: Upon investigation, based on suggestions from various industries under the association, regarding the request to collect business tax based on tiered system by industry, your ministry's approval contained the statement; the request to determine tax tiers based on industry classification is still acceptable and should be kept for reference when the Business Tax Law is amended in the future. Upon investigation, the Business Tax Law was just amended and promulgated on April 16th of this year. Since it involves legislative procedures, repeated requests for modification are not easy. Your ministry's approval, stating "amended in the future," is difficult to predict in terms of time. However, the urgent need for reasonable adjustment of business tax rates for various industries is a matter of utmost urgency. Article 4, Category 1 of this Business Tax Law, which uses the total business income as the standard, levies 1% to 3%. Although the tax law does not have tiered measures, the range of 1% to 3% leaves room for tiered collection. Currently, business taxes in various provinces and cities are collected by local governments according to the revised financial revenue and expenditure system, allowing local governments to adapt to local conditions and stipulate regulations in separate chapters. However, Article 14 of the Detailed Regulations for the Implementation of the Business Tax Law, promulgated on August 16th, states that other industries shall uniformly levy 1.5% of their total business income. The original flexible provisions of Article 4, Category 1 of the Business Tax Law, which allowed provinces and cities to determine tiered collection, are now subject to the rigid provisions of the detailed regulations. The uniform approach prevents provinces and cities from formulating separate chapters to achieve flexibility and maximize benefits, which contradicts the original intention of your ministry's approval, which stated that it was still acceptable. The revision of the Detailed Regulations for the Implementation of the Business Tax Law is easier to handle than the Business Tax Law, which requires legislative procedures. It is suggested that your ministry submit a request to the Executive Yuan to revise Article 14 of the Detailed Regulations to allow provinces and cities to determine the business tax rate on a tiered basis within the statutory range of Article 4 of the Business Tax Law when drafting separate chapters for the collection of business tax. Then your ministry's approval No. 1815, which stated that it was "still acceptable," can be implemented without going through the legislative procedures of amending the Business Tax Law, which seems easier to handle and can comfort the merchants' hopes earlier. We sincerely hope that your ministry will immediately adopt and implement it.

### Modern International Organization Theory and Method

— Ping Fan

G. Delisle Burns believes that modern civilization, from economic, political, and cultural perspectives, relies entirely on continuous communication between nations to form a close-knit organization. However, the understanding of this new state of economic life is still stuck in old patterns. Many people still believe that culture is a local product; the application of the League of Nations system cannot escape the scope of old-fashioned diplomacy. This is because countries have not developed an "international mentality." Therefore, he wrote a book, "Modern International Organization Theory and Method," to create an "international mentality," which has recently been translated into Chinese and is sold by the Commercial Press.

It first talks about the economic aspect: the higher the modern standard of living, the greater the usefulness of the international organization of goods supply; at least in terms of economic function, national borders may be abolished. Secondly, from a cultural perspective: the development of science and art depends on frequent contact with other countries. Although the roots of modern culture in various places are still national and racial, its brilliant flowers must be international. Thirdly, from a political perspective: modern countries cannot fulfill their responsibilities to their own people without cooperating with other countries; the administrative organs of each country, such as commerce, industry, transportation, finance, health, and education, must cooperate with similar organs in other countries. Therefore, the art of governance is decreasing in terms of defense and increasing in terms of international organization. The concept of defense inevitably leads any country that considers itself good to regard expanding its territory as the best way to defend itself. As long as this concept of defending other countries' governments as necessary for any country exists, potential enemies will inevitably exist. As long as there is suspicion of a certain country's government as a potential enemy, it will poison all international communication and prevent the modernization of the State system. The modern country is fundamentally "a part of a single government occupying the globe"—therefore, each government is purely a tool for its people to help the people of other countries; detective work and other war preparations have become obsolete concepts.

According to Burns' argument, the currently popular principles of sovereignty and nationalism naturally cannot stand at all. If the people of all countries can develop such a trusting international mentality, the "world state" that idealists desire will not be difficult to achieve. What war is there? Not only can disarmament be implemented immediately, but even international police do not need to be organized on a large scale. Wouldn't that be a great fortune for mankind? Unfortunately, the facts tell us the complete opposite!

Just from an economic point of view, since the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century, capital has increased with productivity. The domestic market is not enough to supply its development and has to seek markets abroad, and "world communication" has also developed with it. Then, the countries that have risen up are unwilling to endure this kind of economic aggression, so they advocate nationalism to resist it. Those whose forces are evenly matched use nationalism to compete for hegemony. As a result, the economics of nationalism arose in response to the times after the orthodox free economy. As the economic struggle intensified, the political struggle also intensified, and the idea that war is a political tool became a creed for politicians for a time. As a result, the First World War broke out. After the war, the great powers not only did not regret the disaster, but the so-called "balance of power" and "armed peace" remained the core of international politics. Wilson's highly proclaimed Fourteen Points were not actually implemented at all; and the so-called "economic nationalism" was regarded as the golden rule of economic policy. The League of Nations is just a tool for the great powers to use each other; those who do not want to be used form another bloc to fight against each other. As a result, the Second World War broke out again. As many as seventy countries were drawn into the whirlpool of war, with 40 to 50 million military and civilian casualties, and more than 100 billion U.S. dollars spent. The disaster was far greater than the first. After such a catastrophe, logically, we should correct our past mistakes. But did the great powers abide by the Atlantic Charter announced in August 1942? Were the promises of non-expansion, non-unilateral alteration of territory, and non-interference in internal affairs fulfilled? The organization of the United Nations seems to be more advanced than the League of Nations on the surface, but what is the difference between the veto power of the five powers and the provision of unanimous resolutions by the Executive Council of the League of Nations? Aren't the frictions and conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union even more superficial than those between Britain and France in those years? Isn't the old tune of "balance of power" and "armed peace" sung in the nineteenth century still popular there? The number of national defense budgets is much larger than in the League of Nations era; no one even mentions the high-sounding tune of disarmament!

Under such international circumstances, what science, art, and education cannot but be used as a means of selfish nationalism or class struggle. It goes without saying that Germany, which claims to be the "ruling nation," what about other countries that pride themselves on being civilized and advanced, who do not regard promoting their own culture as their responsibility? Therefore, in addition to political aggression and economic aggression, there is also so-called cultural aggression. Now, the socialist country group led by the Soviet Union and the democratic country group led by the United States of America are preventing cultural aggression from each other, like epidemic prevention. Although the Soviet Union has joined the United Nations, it refused to participate in the Agricultural and Food Conference of the UN Committee, what are we talking about cultural exchange and cultural cooperation!

Why are there such different views on the same kind of "world communication"? Why do some think it can promote international peace, while others think it can promote international war? Why is it that international peace is still a fantasy, while promoting international war has become a reality? In the final analysis, it still has to be attributed to the traditional Western view of life. The traditional Western view of life is a thoroughly struggle-based view of life. This view of life should be applied to politics, which is power politics. Today, politics dominates everything, and economics and culture cannot but be its appendages. Even religion is sometimes used by it as a means. The result of power politics is nothing but war. The slogan of war is always said to be for sovereignty and for the nation-state. The "principle of sovereignty," which is the essence of nationalism, is a hypothesis from the European Renaissance. Like Huang Feihu in "Investiture of the Gods" and Sun Wukong, the Monkey King in "Journey to the West," there was no such monster originally, but later someone used propaganda, and temples were built and worshiped everywhere; and the East Mountain Emperor City God Temple is still listed in the sacrificial canon, and the county magistrate has to kowtow and burn incense to it every month? In the eyes of the enlightened, it is really absurd and ridiculous, almost making people laugh. However, everyone says so, and everyone worships it, who will believe you if you say it is fake?

Even Burns himself, according to this book, cannot but be deeply constrained by Western social thought. Because the social thought formed by the Western view of life is purely utilitarian; they believe that nothing that is not worth competing for because it is not profitable cannot arouse interest. Therefore, his argument for world peace based on "world communication" treats the economies, cultures, and politics of various countries as having "exchange value." This theory based on "exchange value" still cannot avoid the petty bourgeois thought of calculating private interests. Everyone knows that people who rush to be the first to seek profit will become estranged when their interests are exhausted, or even harm each other; such international friends cannot be relied on. Even if everything goes according to his wishes and an ordinary "international mentality" is created, I am afraid it will still not be able to promote international peace; I am afraid that the more international communication there is, the faster and more international wars will be! Because the life philosophy of fighting for power and profit is not fundamentally corrected, war is unavoidable. Only by using the Confucian "view of life of benevolence and righteousness" to cultivate an "international mentality" and correct this mistake can the "single government system occupying the globe" be realized, and world peace can have the final guarantee. The theory of benevolence and righteousness: just looking at the surface, it seems to be somewhat aimless; in fact, "righteousness is the root of profit," and there is no result that is not beneficial! It is a pity that such a noble-minded person as Burns still cannot but circle within the old utilitarian paradigm, and does not know that persuading peace with the theory of benevolence and righteousness is more far-reaching and effective. However, when the world is talking about struggle, and is talking about it in a dizzy state, Burns' book is undoubtedly a rare and valuable clearing agent.

### Review of "Middle School Music Teaching Materials"

— Zhang Dinghe

Published by the Music Education Association, Distributed by China Bookstore, Fuzhou Road

For many years, many friends who teach music in middle schools have often asked me to recommend books and music teaching materials. Because no new teaching materials have been published in the rear in recent years, I have only selected some songs for them sporadically. I myself also feel that this method of introduction is really unsystematic, and it also lacks various teaching materials other than songs. I have been thinking in my heart that there should be a complete set of teaching materials to remedy the shortage of teaching materials. I myself also have the intention to try to compile one, but: (1) my learning is shallow, and (2) I lack reference books, so I put it aside.

I didn't expect that the gentlemen of the Music Education Association had already had this idea without prior consultation, and they started to compile this "Middle School Music Teaching Materials" six years ago. I only recently got the news, and immediately borrowed the original manuscript from the editors. After reading it, I felt that these three volumes of teaching materials (divided into upper, middle, and lower volumes) are the most ideal teaching materials. I believe that not long after publication, the music level of Chinese secondary schools will definitely be greatly improved, and it will meet the standard. Indirectly, Chinese music education will also be affected by this book to be popularized and improved.

So, where are the advantages of these teaching materials?

Simply put: it emphasizes equally on music theory, singing, and appreciation. The order of the songs is based on the difficulty of the music, and even more on the order of the seasons and the era of the composers, so that students can make progress imperceptibly. That is to say: imperceptibly, they can have a clear memory of the history of music, the form of music, and the composers and their styles of each era. Moreover, the songs selected in this book have beautiful melodies, complete structures, and appropriate ranges. The lyrics, melodies, and rhythms are all very suitable.

It is quite difficult to use the above advantages as the principle of editing. But these authors did it, and they did it. They wrote it seriously based on many years of teaching experience (for this reason, even if it is only a few faint sentences in the material, they have also referred to many books, and even some come from lengthy biographies.) The original manuscript has been revised and reorganized many times, and now it is about to be published, which cannot but make people admire. They have a serious scholarly attitude, and if you see these teaching materials, you will definitely feel the same.

In these three books, you have no way to see the names of any of the editors. Although the translators and authors of many lyrics were translated or written by someone among the editors, they all used "editor" to come forward. And I heard that in the original manuscript there were many songs that were the works of the editors, but now they are purely editing from the objective attitude of music education, and all those songs have been cancelled. These are all explanations of their serious scholarly attitude. However, I still want to expose it a bit: one of the editors is Mr. Qian Renkang. If you have ever browsed through the book "Music Theory and Composition" (originally written by Prestonware Orem) translated by Jin Shiting and published by Zhonghua Book Company, you will find that the translator's name has some of the same relationship as Mr. Qian's name. That book was printed ten years ago, which shows that Mr. Qian's serious scholarly attitude has always been consistent. Using this attitude to edit teaching materials, students will also be greatly influenced imperceptibly.

However, this set of teaching materials has a shortcoming, that is, the font of the printing plate is too small, which is harmful to students' eyesight. It is hoped that a larger font can be used in the future.

However, in any case, this "Middle School Music Teaching Materials" is a book that is very worthy of recommendation. Because: it not only completed my "try to compile one" for me personally (this is in terms of me personally), but also not only remedied the regret of the shortage of teaching materials in schools, and it is also a powerful new force in the entire Chinese music education.

"Those who study for the imperial examinations read various scriptures, only arranging them for use as materials for current essays, without any interference with themselves. Therefore, what they temporarily use to advance themselves are all the dregs of the ancients, and what they obtain throughout their lives to do things are all the innate habits. It is truly what is called 'books are books, and I am I,' what is the difference from those who do not study?" (Reading Records)
— Xue Jingxuan

"When discussing learning with people, one must also follow the limits of what people can reach. If a tree has these buds, just use this water to irrigate them; when the buds grow longer, add more water. From the size of a handful to the size of an embrace, the merit of irrigation can be followed to the extent that one can reach. If there is a bucket of water for small buds, try to pour it all out, it will rot them." (Records of Practice)
— Wang Yangming

"Whenever people use effort to read books, whether examining names and objects or studying righteousness and reason, when it is complicated and difficult to understand, or when thoughts are exhausted, put down the books and walk around in an open space. Suddenly, thoughts are triggered, and you suddenly understand. There is an unpredicted and natural solution. This is a wonderful way to explore the truth. Or when you are determined to work hard behind closed doors for three winters and two summers, and your belly is full of poems, books, righteousness, and reason, but you come out to walk around for a day or two, you really feel that the water is flowing, the flowers are blooming, the clouds are moving, and the birds are flying. The whole sky is a lively scene. This is the realm that Mencius called life. You don't know whether your hands are dancing or your feet are dancing." (Thoughts on Learning the Great Learning)

### An Overview of the Patent System

— Zhang Mudan Review

Written by Qin Hongji, Published by Commercial Press, Chongqing Edition, September 1945

The modern patent system was established in the British Monopoly Act (1623), and it has only been more than 300 years now. Among various systems, it is relatively new. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the government has repeatedly promulgated various regulations to encourage industrial technology, but it has never established an invention patent management agency. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the lack of materials, in order to seek self-sufficiency and increase the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, the encouragement of industrial technology has been closely watched by government leaders and social elites. It is sincerely believed that the progress of industry depends on the exchange of technology between countries. In industrially backward countries, in order to catch up, it is appropriate to use the patent system to strengthen the absorption of the latest inventions from abroad. In May 1944, the National Government officially promulgated the Patent Law, hoping to implement it within one or two years after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. However, the patent system is still a new creation in China, and important issues such as (1) the theory of the patent system (2) the main points of China's Patent Law (3) how inventors should apply for patents and how to ensure their rights and interests (4) how manufacturing plants should make good use of patent rights, etc., are not fully understood by many technical experts. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the implementation of the Patent Law is imminent, and contact between China's industrial and commercial circles and European and American factories is frequent, and there is often the possibility of involving patent issues. In the past, there was no kind of publication in China that could meet this need, and Mr. Qin Hongji's book just made up for this shortcoming.

The author is an engineer who has served as a senior technical officer in the Ministry of Economy and has been in charge of administrative work for many years, making him the most suitable candidate for compiling this book. The original manuscript was also rewarded by the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education in accordance with the "Regulations on Rewarding Works, Inventions, and Works of Art." Chapters 1 to 2 of the book provide a general description of the origin and evolution of the patent system, as well as the evolution of China's patent system. Chapters 3 to 6 discuss in detail the inventions that can be patented, as well as the nature of inventions, new types, and new patterns. Chapters 7 to 9 describe the main points of applying for patents and the examination procedures of patent agencies. Chapters 10 to 14 discuss the validity, infringement, implementation, and the distribution of rights and interests between labor and capital. Chapters 15 to 17 describe the content of the "International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property," as well as the current laws and regulations of important industrial countries.

This book was published in Chongqing, and it may be available in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places now. After reading it, the author can make four statements: (1) The whole book is carefully selected and rich in materials. Some domestic statistics and explanations have not been publicly published. The foreign precedents and court rulings cited are not easy to find. The sources are noted at the end of the chapter for reference. (2) The whole book uses an objective attitude. Regarding the interpretation of laws, the original text of "precedents" or "explanations" is used as much as possible, without making empty statements. (3) The specifications required for applying for a patent are extremely important, regardless of the policy adopted by the country, whether it is the examination principle or the inventor's rights principle. The original book is summarized and can be called complete, but if more actual examples can be cited, it will be more beneficial to general industrial and commercial readers. (4) Although China's Patent Law has been promulgated, it has not yet been implemented. The original book only explains the current laws and regulations separately regarding the application procedures. In the future, the implementing regulations of the Patent Law and the organizational law of the Patent Office and other relevant laws and regulations will be successively promulgated, and some parts of the original book need to be supplemented urgently. It is heard that the author has left the administrative work and has been hired as an engineer. It is still hoped that he will revise it again in the next edition to make it complete.

Spring and Autumn

### Kunqu Opera "Visiting Su"

— Zhao Jingshen

—Exposing the Plagiarism of the Ancients

I learned Kunqu Opera to play the roles of young male and ugly female. Someone recommended "Visiting Su" from "The Story of the Red Pear," saying that this play was good to listen to. After I learned it, the role of "I" was indeed not bad, the tunes were smooth and pleasing to the ear, so I often hummed the tunes in it:

(Yichun Ling) A nature for romance, an intestines of cloud and rain, naturally mad about flowers and willows. The new lyrics are delicate, and the pretty name is worthy of competing with Qiu Niang. Su Xiaoxiao is equally talented and beautiful, and Lü Shuangshuang is no less romantic. Risking getting drunk with beautiful women in brocade zithers, green screens, and red curtains.

(Previous Tune) Wei Niang's face, a magistrate's intestines, secret feelings of the heart, snuggling up to each other since buying [her]. (Excerpt)

(Previous Tune) Just because of the beauty of her face and the jade appearance, facing death, they invasively invite her to seek the phoenix. (Excerpt)

(Putian Le) Just hoping to stir up clouds and rain in Wushan's barrier. (Excerpt)

(Jin Jidao) Mistakenly identified as King Xiang of Chu. (Excerpt)

I accidentally flipped through Volume 4 of the "Yongxi Yuefu" and saw the suite by an anonymous author from the Yuan or early Ming Dynasty. Only then did I realize that Xu Fuzuo's "Visiting Su" was actually copied from this suite. I hereby record it in full, and mark the identical words and sentences with black circles on both sides:

(Dian Jiangchun) Moon-lit windows and cloud-like doors, green screens and red curtains. In the brothel, there is a delicate red makeup, the beauty of which is truly worthy of appreciation.

(Hunjiang Long) In the lane of Wo-ke, the pretty name occupies the brothel. Songs are sung about gold threads, dances are watched with rainbow skirts, talent and beauty surpass Su Xiaoxiao, romance is no less than Lü Shuangshuang. Listening to the gentle singing, it is like flowers understanding speech, like jade producing fragrance.

(Shan Ronglu) Apricot faces and peach cheeks with palace-style makeup, walking on silk socks as cool as ripples, truly a song of spring breeze by Du Wei Niang. Looking at this shy flower and closing moon charming appearance, I cannot understand the illusion of stirring up clouds and rain. Arrange a false sincerity, use some clever tricks, hide the deception of the young men and the瞒天谎, the appearance is very dignified.

(Tianxia Le) Doesn't that bother the intestines of the Suzhou magistrate, Sima should not be commonplace. If King Xiang of Chu saw it, he would also have a laborious dream. How can he withstand her touching green eyebrows, her soul-stirring cloud-like hair, let alone her captivating smile.

(Jinzhan'er) Leaning against the east wall, close to the west wing, talented scholars and beautiful women are often close to each other. How can the secret feelings of the heart be forgotten?引惹的崔生频觅浆,逼临的韩寿偷香,因此上楼迟风月所,留恋在雨云儿鄕。

(Tail Sound) In the heart, I think, I'm afraid I can't say that the face of the year is just fragrant, I'm just afraid that people's hearts will not last long. Look for the painted pavilion and orchid hall early, but the phoenix has flown away. How can you not consider it? Looking back at the starry rain temples, you will miss the floating clouds covering the moon, and the flowers will wither in the violent wind, in which the bees and butterflies sell their good spring?

Approximately, Xu Fuzuo's "The Story of the Red Pear" likes to plagiarize other people's works. "The Pavilion Meeting" uses a lot of the second act of Zhang Shouqing's "Red Pear Flower Zaju" from the Yuan Dynasty. "The Flower Woman" plagiarizes even more from the third act of "Red Pear Flower."

### Memories of Plum Blossoms

— Xie Zi

My love for plum blossoms is, undeniably, a kind of deep attachment. When I was little, I didn't pay much attention to plum blossoms, only feeling that they had a clear, cold fragrance that made one yearn for them. We used to live in a remote county, and outside my bedroom window there happened to be two ancient plum trees. Sometimes, just as the sky was beginning to brighten, the snow on the ground would illuminate the window panes with a white glow; yet on the white window paper were dark shadows, just like plum blossoms painted with light ink. At this time, half-dreaming and half-awake, I would only feel a rush of clear, cold fragrance that intoxicated me, as if reality was mixed with dreams.

Three years ago, when I was twenty, I happened to buy a collection of poems by Lin Bu. This collection also had a clear, cold style, like plum blossoms. Among them, there were especially many poems praising plum blossoms, and I read these poems over and over until I could recite them. I felt that Lin Bu's love for plum blossoms was also a kind of deep attachment, perhaps because Lin Bu's love was too delicate, too profound, and he couldn't find a girl in this world who could understand him, so he took plum blossoms as his wife and cranes as his children. Although he was a noble hermit, he was so deeply infatuated. He often told the plum blossoms his foolish thoughts, loved them, praised them, to the point of being unable to control himself. The plum blossom, having found such a confidant, should have added a touch of redness to its pure white petals.

Perhaps it was because I was influenced by something, but I also began to love plum blossoms; although my personality was not as noble and elegant as Lin Bu's, emotionally, I was also sentimental. I recited Lin Bu's poems again and again, feeling a kind of secret, secluded emotion that made one intoxicated. A kind of longing grew in my heart, loving plum blossoms, thinking about plum blossoms, and finally encountering plum blossoms.

That autumn, at university, I met a beautiful girl—beautiful in her purity, beautiful in her elegance, beautiful in her pitiableness. Her name was Mei (Plum), perhaps she was the soul of the plum blossom? I will never forget the bewilderment I felt the first time I saw her. Her even features, her slender figure, and her gentle, pure spirit combined to create a perfect, yet not very practical person. At least in this bustling world, she could be called a miracle. I couldn't help but feel the pent-up enthusiasm in my heart, and I said to myself: "Now you have truly encountered plum blossoms, these plum blossoms will not wither, not only in your heart, but also before your eyes, how should you cherish this beautiful moment!" This beautiful moment truly arrived: endless love, countless dreams. But it was only a short year, this kind of delicate love was suffocating, so suffocating that I couldn't breathe.

Perhaps because of this, and also because of my devotion to beauty, I left Mei, leaving her with tears in my eyes. I became a pitiful martyr for beauty! After that, I continued to live in the bustling world, encountering many beautiful girls, just like encountering many beautiful flowers, but no matter what, I would not love them, I could no longer love, my love had already been buried with the memory of plum blossoms. From then on, I would always use tears to irrigate it, irrigate this beautiful flower—perhaps a plum blossom woven from emotion and imagination!

But why am I so stubborn! In this world of ten thousand purples and thousands of reds, I only love plum blossoms, and after being touched by this tragic memory, all the plum blossoms seem to me to be able to understand my words.

However, my heart has changed a little, not changed, but suppressed. I have already decided to be an ordinary person, putting all my energy into my career, to make myself forget everything. Or else I will go to places of entertainment to walk around, to seek stimulation, to seek anesthesia. But no matter how depraved my life becomes, this memory of plum blossoms must still be "placed in a crystal bottle, held with both hands."

A few days ago, a relative mentioned Mei again, it turned out they knew each other. She only knew that Mei was a beautiful girl who used to be my classmate. She hoped that we would meet again. She said it so calmly, but she didn't know how much pain it stirred up in my heart. Years of living against my will have buried all my pain and joy, and I don't want any new fluctuations. I can't think, I dare not think, how should I think? If we still have a day of reunion, facing each other!

I can only steel my heart to prevent this possible happiness, perhaps possible pain! Let this memory of plum blossoms keep its clarity in my heart! After the washing of the years, after the destruction of wind, frost, rain, and snow, it is still so vivid, so profound. This source of mystery will never dry up. I am willing to do my best to create a crystal world for plum blossoms, where there is no pain, no annoyance. The plum blossoms there are tinted with red, and the sunshine shining on the plum blossoms is eternal.

### Tears

— Jiang Huai

Tears run through my intertwined years, repeatedly soaking my own sorrows and some joyous laughter…

Often in the deep night, deep thought draws my tearful gaze to the tears of the sky outside the window. The leaden, dust-laden mood also shifts to the vastness of the spirit! Especially when the dripping rain of starless, eternal nights repeatedly plucks at the hidden tear stains, in the resonance, it often touches off two new streams.

Perhaps friends always see me plunging into the springs of tears with a weak posture; but I am unwilling to have them inquire about my release of these bitter juices. (Although there is also a hint of grape flavor…) I would rather savor the taste alone in solitude.

But I can similarly dig out some of life's truths. Tears are to life as the earth's summer heat is washed clean and cool by a torrential rain; the lotus leaves in the pond, before the sudden clearing, are cleansed to be refreshing. I believe: in the sins, cruelty, ambition, tyranny, and grimacing faces of this world, their tears will not naturally flow. And a truly unadorned tear can be used to examine one's own life, like a small grass flower accepting the dew's moisture to welcome the morning sun and strengthen its vitality!

When I see an innocent child with two small lanterns hanging on their pure face; a decrepit saintly mother flickering with her compassionate light; a group of homeless people silently pleading with unconsoleable crystal beads for their lives, and those soldiers shedding loyal and brave nectar; the strivers silently enduring all the frustrations in tears… Ah! Although they are all less than the reality of blood and the strength of iron, they are far beyond those shameless smiles!…

Tears—let them flow naturally! Rely on this innate instinct to wash one's own hands at the pillow, the desk, the deep mountains and great marshes, then drip them on the stubborn instep, then pick them up and cherish them in the plate of one's life. In the deep dark tunnel, in the night, in the boundless, gloomy earth, look at the shining light, illuminating your path forward!

### Autumn Talk

— Jiang Shangqing

Another year has passed easily, and it is once again the cool autumn season of falling wutong leaves; as I have gotten older, I have become particularly concerned about the seasons. When I was a child, every early autumn, I would follow some wild children to catch crickets by the walls and corners of the house, patrolling the wilderness every night, the lamplight and people's faces still seem like yesterday when I think about them. My father was a muddleheaded bug who drank all day and didn't care about anything else. Every autumn evening, with drunken eyes, he would point to the sky, saying that one was Uranus, Neptune, and that one was the Milky Way, and then sigh about his own old age, which was now full of emptiness and loneliness like autumn.

According to Chinese poets, autumn symbolizes middle age, with wind howling, trees bare, and yellow leaves falling, a desolate scene that is indeed different from spring and summer. Historically, sensitive poets, living in this kind of situation, although grieving over their own lives, could only say "silently seeing off spring"; moreover, after "tearful eyes questioning the flowers, the falling red flies past the swing," how could they chew on "last night the west wind withered the green trees, alone I climbed the high building to gaze at the end of the sky"? So all that was left was: "lifting the curtain to face the west wind, people are thinner than yellow flowers"; moreover, how many lovelorn men and women have watched spring turn into summer, summer turn into autumn, thinking of home, cherishing the past, people are not made of wood or stone, who can be without emotion, so they do not hesitate to: "my clothes grow wider, I do not regret it, for her I grow haggard."

Xin Youan has a poem "Ugly Slave," describing the psychology of young people and middle-aged people, called: "Young people do not know the taste of sorrow, love to go upstairs, love to go upstairs; to write new words and force sorrow. Now I know the taste of sorrow, wanting to speak but stopping, wanting to speak but stopping; but I say it's a good autumn because it's cool," generally autumn gives people more fantasy and less warmth: the red leaves are dotted, like the tears of those who leave, so the toiling people and thinking wives hum the lines "Today I have become a friend of phoenixes, only then do I know that red leaves are good matchmakers," and cannot help but feel heartbroken. In fact, autumn comes and autumn goes, and it doesn't care about people's idle affairs, but people stubbornly ask the flowers about their tears and sow their emotions with sorrow; "if heaven has feelings, heaven should grow old" God is heartless, but people's faces in the mirror have changed to full temples of frost.

Seeing the autumn clouds like gauze, changing unpredictably, a white sail hanging on the tree tops at the edge of the sky, sailing into the yellow leaves, there is a lonely old man, leaning on a cane on the plank bridge; the water flows eastward, and people will pass away to the west. In the distance, there is a middle-aged woman, drying clothes in the west building, watching a pair of water gulls up and down, leaning on the railing and thinking, I don't know what she is thinking. Farther away: a desolate scene, the wind blowing the grass low, cattle and sheep dotted, jumping and chasing in the slanting sunset. Everyone has experienced this scene more or less. Looking back like a dream, occasionally thinking about it, it really makes people want it so much, love it so much, hate it so much, feel sorrow so much.

"Who planted banana trees outside the window, rustling in the morning, rustling in the evening" When a person's emotions are so overwhelmed that they cannot be vented, they often cannot help but complain about various things; but in reality, it is often: "It is your heart that is too bored, planting banana trees and complaining about banana trees."

Holding the pen in confusion, thinking about the years of drifting about, I always feel disappointed like looking for red flowers in autumn. "Autumn wind is rogue, the traveler has no clothes" Autumn after all gives people desolate memories.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 36

You might retort to the writer: "Of this long legend you are writing now, at least five or six tenths are about reports of our counter-espionage work, is there not even one character in there who is 'still working'? Even if some have already changed positions, with the other side being so petty, contemptible, and treacherous, and actively operating, organizing, and preparing under various disguises; when the time comes, they will surely 'do it again,' 'punish,' 'annihilate,' aren't they paying attention to these people?"

Regarding this, I can clearly report to you; some of the characters I have written about have made regrettable and honorable sacrifices; some, to put it more mysteriously, are impossible for the Japanese devils to discover; and for some, there are detailed records of each of them in the important secret books of the Japanese devils, and the important demonic stars of those international "war criminals" also know them, and some have even had more than a cup of wine with them, but these characters, perhaps to put it a bit exaggeratedly, they truly have the subtlety of divine dragons and the unpredictability of ghosts and gods. If the Japanese devils want to do anything to them, I'm afraid they can't do it.

However, there are many "continued" related actions, not to mention me, I'm afraid anyone would find it inconvenient to write about, and there is no need to write about them. For example, part of what Mr. W is talking about here in Yaoqun is indeed unnecessary to write about. Only a few principles on the oath might as well be published; after Mr. W explained the nature of the oath and the personnel organization, he continued:

"...In addition to these outlines, we also have a "three haves" doctrine: first, do not be greedy for credit; second, do not be afraid of sacrifice, but do not make unnecessary sacrifices; third, do not waver. The so-called unwavering has a broader meaning; in short, it is to always uphold justice, and under any harsh circumstances, "wealth and honor cannot corrupt... power and force cannot subdue." Incidentally, there is also an important condition; that is "integrity"..."

Speaking of this, Mr. W couldn't help but sigh, turned around, and told me a story about "integrity":

It was before the July 7th Incident, when the Japanese devils formally provoked the war, they wanted to occupy North China without bloodshed, so they implemented Matsuoka's bankrupt household doctrine of "armed smuggling." Our counter-espionage organization quickly sent a group of comrades to confront those ruffian merchants. Among them, there was a young comrade who had always worked diligently and had very high aspirations.

For a long period of time, this young man was able to stick to his post. Later, he received a letter from home saying that his mother was seriously ill, and medicine and nutrition all required money. You know, our secret service comrades, although they were doing the work of beheading and shedding blood, were just like soldiers, with graded salaries, and very meager.

This comrade, just when he was at a loss, happened to catch a batch of smuggled goods. According to his usual behavior, he could resist everything and implement "handling official business officially." But when he was in this urgent need of money and short of money, he actually succumbed, accepted several hundred yuan in activity fees, and let the smuggled goods go. This matter can be said to be absolutely "unknown to gods and ghosts"; because the secret service organization completely took the principle of trust for each comrade.

This young comrade, in terms of self-confidence; he believed that it was absolutely "only this once, no exceptions." Who knew that this kind of thing, once an exception was made, no matter how big or small the exception was, it was like digging a gap in a dam, and it was impossible to avoid a flood, as the saying goes "do it long enough and you will make a mistake"; so this comrade was caught and shot.

### Municipal Council

— Shao Fu

Today is the fourth day of the council meeting. As a citizen, I can say that I am very satisfied with our representatives for the past three days, because our representatives have truly done their best to speak without reservation. It is especially worth mentioning that two councilors were originally members of the Political Council, but they were willing to resign from the Political Council and serve as councilors for the local area. This spirit of starting from basic work is enough to set an example for future local autonomy, and it is something that should be praised.

The Greater Shanghai area is vast, with a large population and a complex environment. There are many works to be done and reforms to be made. Especially after eight years of enemy and puppet occupation, it is truly a complex and chaotic situation. Although the municipal authorities are determined to move forward, their eyes and ears may not be able to see everything, and their methods may be lacking. Having a municipal council is like having two ears on a car, either making proposals or asking questions, even if they are passionate and angry, with stern faces and sharp words, even if they are tit-for-tat and aggressive: but they are definitely not enemies or rivals deliberately making trouble. If they are oversensitive and think that so-and-so has a personal grudge against me, or so-and-so is unhappy because of something... then they are鑽入牛角尖 (lit. drilling into a bull's horn, meaning getting into a dead end), only bureaucrats would think that way.

Shanghai is a big city, and the cooperation between the municipal council and the municipal government should have a demonstrative effect for the whole country. We certainly trust our representatives to express our opinions completely and without reservation, but we also hope that what we propose will not be perfunctory by the municipal government, but will be sincerely considered and implemented.

There are still nine days left in the session of the municipal council, and fruitful results can be expected. I would like to offer my advance congratulations.

### Lay Down the Cleaver and Become a Buddha on the Spot: A Bandit Achieves Enlightenment

— Chong Zhen

The major bandit Yang ×× has revolted, and we have some feelings about it. Recalling the name of Yang ××, it was not well known in the past. Because he was a traitor and a bandit, and now he has revolted; therefore, we have gradually come to know him again, and it turns out that he is a role who is accustomed to doing tricks.

His trilogy is: traitor, bandit, revolt. During the enemy puppet era, the name of Yang Si Taiye was almost known to everyone in the corners of Jiangnan, and he was extremely popular for a time. He successively served as the chief of staff of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Security Headquarters, and the puppet county magistrate of Wujiang and Wuxi, etc. At that time, he was powerful and did whatever he wanted. The people in his jurisdiction all hated him to the bone.

The arrival of victory was also his doomsday. Yang ×× knew that things were not good, and it was difficult to escape the law. Therefore, he changed his body and continued to do the things of a gangster, scurrying into Taihu Lake and becoming a bandit leader. After Yang entered Taihu Lake, he recruited soldiers and horses, and gathered bandits, about five hundred people and fourteen ships, entrenched near Pingtai Mountain, set up the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army Headquarters" flag, and appointed himself commander-in-chief, still acting as the local emperor. He looted the surrounding villages, so that the order in several counties near Taihu Lake, such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujiang, and Yixing, was unstable and the security was difficult.

The authorities were extremely concerned about this matter. Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo General has ordered Commander Li Mo'an of the First Pacification District to suppress the bandits within a time limit in order to prevent the bandit scourge. After Yang the bandit heard about it, he knew that there was no room for him to stand, so he actually revolted in a proper manner.

In fact, his set of tricks is known to everyone. Being a traitor is to willingly sell out the country. If caught, he would be shot. He had no choice but to "enter" Taihu Lake and temporarily avoid it. When everyone's eyes were turned away, and they thought he was a bandit, he was very happy, and of course he took this opportunity to revolt. Not only was the crime of banditry cancelled, but even the old debt of being a traitor was written off.

Today, although he is confessing that he has always kept himself behind closed doors and has never entered the lake as a bandit, and is willing to engage in pacification work under the leadership of the government, how beautiful he speaks, better than listening to a clear song.

His three sets of tricks are: being a traitor is willingly selling out the country, being a bandit is a bridge to escape the crime of being a traitor, and revolting is achieving enlightenment.

We dare not say that even the opportunity to reform is denied, but to lay down the cleaver and achieve enlightenment all at once is a bit "that"!

### Stock Exchange

— Xing Xin

The name of the exchange varies from country to country. In the old days, our country called it "Maoqian Company." In the laws of the Republic of China, it was officially named "Exchange."

The first exchange established in China was the Beijing Stock Exchange, which opened on August 1, 1918. This was the first exchange in Shanghai.

The Shanghai exchange business was most developed in the summer and autumn of 1921, with more than 140 companies, but they all perished within a few months, which is known as the "Tenth Year Turmoil."

Before the war, Shanghai's five major exchanges were securities, gold, yarn, flour, and miscellaneous grains, with securities and yarn trading being the most prosperous.

In my old and stubborn brain, the stock exchange is deeply engraved as a speculative place, and the employees are speculative friends.

It is said that speculation is absolutely different from gambling. Speculators use experience, knowledge, and judgment to determine gains and losses; while gambling aims to take advantage of luck.

The prosperity of Shanghai's consumer market largely depends on the support of speculators.

Some people estimate that the ratio of speculators who fail in the stock exchange to those who start from the stock exchange is exactly the same as the ratio of legal tender to counterfeit money, two hundred to one.

The Shaohai Securities Exchange opened recently. Some people say that the establishment of a capital market is worth celebrating; others say, be careful of fire!

### Hong Kong Tram

— Housheng

——He Youzhi Shi

Anyone who has been to Hong Kong will feel the convenience and comfort of the Hong Kong tram, and it also has a sense of beauty. It is perpetually clad in a green, brand-new coat, with two floors, tall, like a box, gliding lightly beneath the mountains and along the coast.

The number of trams in Hong Kong can truly be described as closely packed. Morning, day, evening, no matter what time it is, when you leave home and walk to the station, there is always a tram parked there, waiting for you to ride. Passengers will not have the phenomenon of rushing to be first. For a past tram, there will never be any lingering or regretful feelings, because when the first one leaves, in less than a minute, the second one will follow, and there will never be a long wait or inability to get on.

On the tram, although there are doors, they are not closed, and no passenger will stand on the platform or lose their footing while driving. Therefore, passengers can enter and exit freely, and do not have to wait for the ticket seller to open the door when they arrive at the station. In the morning, you can see wealthy mistresses dressed neatly, carrying baskets full of fish, meat, vegetables, standing leisurely holding the pillars inside the tram. Although the small vegetable market is only as far from home as Sincere Company is from Dah Sun Company, the mistresses will never give up this convenient means of transportation.

Every tram is not overcrowded. The first-class upper level is often sparsely populated with one person, mostly foreigners and upper-class Chinese. Ordinary people do not sit in first class, it is better to say that it is to save a little money than to say that it is inconvenient to go up and down the stairs. However, in the evening, there are still many leisurely people sitting in the front row of first class, taking a ride, enjoying the cool breeze, and looking at the city scenery. This can be said to be a cheap, good, and unsurpassed entertainment.

The population density of Hong Kong is much greater than that of Shanghai. However, taking the tram in Hong Kong is such a convenient and enjoyable thing, while in Shanghai it is such a troublesome and painful thing. In a word, it is only a matter of more or fewer vehicles.

### On Transportation

A Record of Commander Ji's Conversation

For half a year, Shanghai's transportation has been in chaos.

To say something to excuse the authorities, in fact, the authorities are not ignoring this issue, but in this extremely complex Shanghai, the number of vehicles of all kinds is increasing day by day, and it is not easy to seek a sweeping solution in a short period of time! Moreover, the generation of a method is always difficult to reach a special class.

On the 22nd of last month, Commander Ji, when attending the Shanghai Alumni Association's dinner, mentioned the Shanghai transportation problem.

Commander Ji said: "Today, I advise all of you as a classmate. For the vehicles in Shanghai (including cars, trucks, jeeps, etc.), I have issued an order to all subordinate agencies that all vehicles must have a permit. After this order was issued, the first to comply were the vehicles of the US military throughout the city. Not one of them is without a permit. However, on the contrary, it is our own military vehicles, jeeps, etc. that cannot be fully complied with. I only hope that those of you who are present, if you have a vehicle and do not have a permit, should apply for the permit as soon as possible, otherwise, you cannot blame me when you are caught in the future!"

Recently, the measures decided by Mayor Wu's meeting to improve traffic have been strictly implemented since September 9th. Vehicles that violate the rules three times will have their licenses revoked. These days, the traffic on the roads seems to be a little better. At any time, if you want to cross the road, you will feel in your mind that the traffic order has changed.

But here, what we urgently hope for is: everyone abides by the traffic regulations, and does not take pride in acting outside the rules! Otherwise, under any circumstances, there is no hope for Shanghai's transportation!

### A Military Man Turned Politician: Zhang Qun Travels to the US for Cancer Treatment

— Gan Lai

Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 9th. At 8:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, he hastily departed from Shanghai Jiangwan Airport on a special plane to the United States. It is said that Mr. Zhang's trip abroad is to treat toxic cancer under his left jaw. This cancer developed a year ago, initially causing no pain or discomfort, but recently it has become slightly bothersome. After diagnosis by a Western doctor, it was identified as toxic cancer. Mr. Zhang followed the advice and went to the United States for medical treatment. Taking this opportunity, the author will discuss the life stories of this "military man turned politician."

Studying in Japan

Zhang, whose courtesy name is Yuejun, is from Huayang, Sichuan, and was born in the 13th year of the Guangxu Emperor. After graduating from the Baoding Military Rapid Training School, he enrolled in the Tokyo Japanese Army Officer School. It was during this time that he participated in the Tongmenghui, an organization of students studying in Japan. During the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to Shanghai from Japan with Chairman Chiang, serving as a section chief in the Shanghai Military Governor's Office and as the commander of the 23rd Division. In the 6th year of the Republic (1917), he served as a military advisor in the Grand Marshal's Office and in the military government. From the 8th to the 9th year of the Republic (1919-1920), he managed police affairs in Sichuan Province. From the 13th to the 14th year of the Republic (1924-1925), he was responsible for reorganizing police affairs in Henan Province. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the chief advisor to the Commander-in-Chief and presided over the affairs of the Nanchang Headquarters. Subsequently, he served as a member of the Military Affairs Commission. In March of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), he was appointed as the director of the Shanghai Arsenal. In October, he was reassigned as the Deputy Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Military Administration and concurrently as the Director of the Arsenal Administration and the President of Tongji University. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. On April 1st of the same year, he became the Mayor of Shanghai, resigning in January of the 21st year of the Republic (1932). Subsequently, he served as the Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government until today.

During His Tenure as Mayor of Shanghai

During Mr. Zhang's tenure as Mayor of Shanghai, local tabloids published news that Mr. Zhang had been shot at, resulting in the injury of his bodyguard. Mr. Zhang dismissed it with a smile. In fact, Mr. Zhang has always acted impartially throughout his life, believing that he had not offended anyone, so he never hired a bodyguard. When Mr. Zhang first arrived in Shanghai, he rented a small house on Rue Lupan. A friend, Mr. Zheng, advised him to move to a better residence. Mr. Zhang replied that his health was not good and he could not afford to buy a house. Mr. Zheng offered to sell his own house on Avenue Albert, agreeing on a price of 20,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, three months passed, and Mr. Zhang was still penniless and unable to pay. Later, it was changed to installment payments, and the purchase of the house was finally settled.

There is also a well-known anecdote about Mr. Zhang and Chairman Chiang: When Martyr Chen Ying Shi served as the Military Governor of Shanghai, Chairman Chiang and Mr. Zhang were both subordinates. One winter night, Mr. Zhang entered Chairman Chiang's office to discuss an important military secret. The matter was complex and mysterious, and neither could immediately decide. They lowered their heads and pondered, remaining silent for a long time. The biting north wind was piercingly cold, and the two sat facing each other, stiff as wooden chickens. As Chiang Kai-shek had not replied, Zhang Qun also did not speak further and waited until the break of dawn.

Regarding Mr. Zhang's trip to the United States for medical treatment, some speculate that he is carrying a major mission, but relevant parties have indicated that this is not true.
