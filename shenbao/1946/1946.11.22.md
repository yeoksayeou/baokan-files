In accordance with Article 2 of the National Assembly Presidium Election Regulations, the Assembly Presidium was elected. Representatives arrived one after another around 2 PM. The atmosphere inside and outside the venue was filled with greetings, laughter, and excitement. All the Assembly staff were mobilized, doubling their efforts. The chrysanthemums on display were completely replaced in the morning, dazzlingly vibrant. The atmosphere of the Assembly was completely refreshed, tense, and enthusiastic, unprecedented since the opening. At 3:12 PM, the first bell rang, and the representatives took their seats. Chairman Chiang also entered the venue with his wife. Subsequently, Hong Lanyou reported that the total number of representatives was 2050, with the appointment of 1660 representatives already announced. As of the start of the meeting, 1548 had registered, and 1467 were present, sufficient to meet the legal quorum. At 3:20 PM, Sun Fo continued to serve as the temporary chairman, presiding over the meeting. First, the rapporteur read the minutes of the second preparatory meeting, followed by Hong Lanyou reporting on the election process and list of elected candidates for the Presidium. Hong began by stating: "The Presidium candidates from each unit were all elected yesterday. As for the re-elections of some representatives and those who voluntarily gave up their elected positions, they have been successively filled by those with the most votes. A total of 179 candidates were elected from 53 electoral units." He continued, "Representative Chiang Kai-shek was elected as a candidate from the Nanjing electoral unit. The National Assembly Chiang Committee, considering that Representative Chiang had already been elected by the Kuomintang, sent a letter to the Nanjing electoral unit requesting a re-election. The reply stated that after careful consideration, they firmly requested Representative Chiang as a candidate for the Nanjing area, and Representative Chiang accepted, giving up the position elected by the Kuomintang." Finally, he read the entire list.

Chairman Chiang and His Wife Personally Voted at the Ballot Box

After Hong finished speaking, he read a temporary motion from Zhu Jingnong and 126 others, "Proposing to reserve seats in the Presidium for the Communist Party and the Democratic League to demonstrate the spirit of peace and democracy of the Assembly." It was unanimously passed with applause, reserving five seats for the Communist Presidium and four for the Democratic League. Subsequently, Yang Dizhong, a representative of the indigenous people of Guizhou, moved to confirm and add seats for candidates of ethnic minorities to the Presidium. Zhu Jingnong and more than ten representatives of various indigenous groups from the Southwest, including Ma Qingweng and Shi Hagui, spoke in succession, and the debate was extremely fierce. Finally, Hong Lanyou, on behalf of the chairman, announced that Representative Zhang Dao Fan had been elected as a Presidium candidate in the Kuomintang unit and voluntarily gave up the seat elected in Guizhou, which was filled by Yang Dizhong, a representative of the indigenous people of Guizhou. A dispute was resolved after much debate. At 4:20 PM, Chairman Sun Fo announced: "The election begins," and asked the journalists and non-staff members in the venue to leave to facilitate a headcount. Subsequently, Hong reported on the voting instructions, requesting each representative to secretly select 46 people from the list of 55 printed on the ballot (excluding the seats reserved for the Communist Party and the Democratic League) and read the list of the 64 voting supervisors designated by the Chairman. Subsequently, ballots were distributed, and each representative left individually after voting. Chairman Chiang and his wife personally deposited their ballots into Ballot Box No. 2 in front of the speaker's platform next to their seats at 4:55 PM. At 5:00 PM, they stepped out of the venue, rested briefly in the lounge behind the auditorium, and then returned to their residence by car.

It is not yet known whether he will stay in Peiping for a while.

### Incumbent Civil Servants May Not Be Dismissed Without Cause

The Executive Yuan Issues a Circular to All Provinces and Cities for Compliance

[Central News Agency, This City] It is a common practice in all countries that administrative officials do not advance or retreat with political officials. The Executive Yuan, based on the proposal of the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Transportation, the Water Conservancy Commission, and the Ministry of Personnel for the protection of incumbent civil servants, resolved to forward it to the Ministry of Personnel for reference in the formulation of the Protection Law. Before the promulgation of the Protection Law, the National Government is requested to reiterate the previous orders issued to protect administrative officials and instruct all agencies to strictly comply. If there are any violations of laws and regulations, the Control Yuan should impeach and punish according to law. Before the enactment of the Civil Servants Protection Law, it has long been clearly stipulated that administrative officials of all agencies do not advance or retreat with political officials, and civil servants appointed according to law may not be dismissed without cause. The Executive Yuan has issued a circular to all provinces and cities. It is heard that this instruction has arrived in Shanghai. After receiving the order, the municipal government immediately instructed its subordinate agencies to comply.

### The Democratic Socialist Party's Meeting of Cadres in Peiping and Tianjin Passes a Resolution to Participate in the National Assembly, Provided that the Government Implements the Party's Proposals

[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 21st] Forty-one senior cadres of the Democratic Socialist Party in Peiping and Tianjin held a joint meeting at Tang Xiangming's residence on the afternoon of the 21st and decided to support participation in the National Assembly. The two important resolutions were: (1) To support Mr. Zhang Junli's conditions to Chairman Chiang and participate in the National Assembly under those conditions. (2) If the government cannot implement the conditions proposed by the Democratic Socialist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party may withdraw from the National Assembly at any time. Most of the government's attendees at the National Assembly still hope that the Democratic Socialist Party can continue to maintain its third-party stance in order to prepare for a second mediation. The opinions on participating in the National Assembly were very divided in the Peiping Democratic Socialist Party, but after Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi made extensive contacts and explained in detail the intentions of the Democratic Socialist Party members in Nanjing and Shanghai, the two resolutions above were passed on the 21st by a majority of thirty-two to nine. However, the debate was still fierce during the discussion. The meeting started at 3 PM and the vote was taken at 6 PM. Zhang Dongsun did not attend the meeting on the 21st and still insisted on his attitude of not participating. Another member of the Central Standing Committee, Liang Qiushui, also sent a letter to the meeting, stating that he personally would not participate in the National Assembly. Sun and Ye have successfully completed their mission to the north and will fly to Nanjing with Wan Renqian on the morning of the 22nd to report to Zhang Junli. At the meeting on the 21st, no specific decisions were made on the number of seats and election methods for the Northern Democratic Socialist Party. A general opinion will continue to be discussed on the 22nd, hoping that the representatives will be generated from the bottom up. In addition, it was heard that someone mentioned at the meeting that the Youth Party has one hundred representatives, and the Democratic Socialist Party is even more important than the Youth Party, and the number of representatives should also be expanded, and it is hoped that this requirement can be realized.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The Democratic Socialist Party's letter to the Presidium was submitted to Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, on the 20th for forwarding to the Chairman. The Chairman's reply has not yet been sent out. According to Jiang Yuntian, it will be announced as soon as the Chairman's reply arrives, so that people across the country can understand. As for the content of the letter, it is not yet known. The Democratic Socialist Party is still waiting for Zhang and others to arrive in Nanjing before it can determine the list to be submitted to the National Assembly.

(3) The members of the Northern Democratic Socialist Party have a significant influence on the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly.

[Our Correspondent, Exceptionally Huge Day] It is widely rumored here that Chief of Staff Chen Cheng and Director Li Zongren will fly to Nanjing on the 23rd.

### Legislative Yuan Changes to Meeting Today to Review the Constitution Draft Amendment

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The Legislative Yuan originally scheduled to open a joint review meeting of the five committees at 4:30 PM on the 21st to review the "Amendment to the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China" passed by the Central Standing Committee on the 20th and submitted to the Yuan to complete the legislative process. However, because most legislators were also National Assembly representatives, they attended the National Assembly Presidium election in the afternoon of the 21st and could not attend in time. The review meeting did not reach the legal quorum, so it was temporarily changed to 9:30 AM on the 22nd. It is heard that according to the legislative process, after the amendment is passed by the joint review meeting, it must be passed by the plenary meeting of the Legislative Yuan to complete the procedure. However, since it is a joint meeting of the five committees, if the members believe that there is no need to hold a plenary meeting, it can also be regarded as completing the legislative process.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The Amendment to the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China was passed by the Central Standing Committee on the 20th. This is sufficient to show the government's respect for the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and its determination to realize democracy. Some people are quite worried about whether the case can be smoothly passed by the Legislative Yuan. A reporter visited an authoritative observer on the 21st, who said: In the past, the Central Standing Committee or the National Defense Council only decided on the principles of various laws, and then handed them over to the Legislative Yuan for drafting. This time, the Central Standing Committee passed the amendment, which was based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and revised and researched by the government representatives of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Review Committee, and then revised and researched again by the representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and local notables to form a revised draft. Therefore, when it was submitted to the Central Standing Committee yesterday, it was already a bill, not a principle, which is different from the previous procedure. According to the law of power organs, after the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Council pass a bill, the Legislative Yuan only completes the legislative procedure. Even if the Legislative Yuan has some disputes over the bill, there will be no changes. Outsiders believe that there will be some disputes in the Legislative Yuan, but this is unlikely to happen, this is one. It is also learned that after an hour of discussion by the Central Standing Committee, some members expressed different opinions, some advocated discussing it article by article, and some advocated deciding on the principles first. Later, because the President gave some instructions, the final discussion result was that the amendment had been carefully studied and there was no need to make any changes, so the original proposal was submitted for approval, this is two. Based on the above two points, even if the Legislative Yuan discusses the case, it will not extend the time very much, so there is no need to worry. When the amendment is submitted to the National Assembly in the future, it is believed that the Kuomintang will definitely find a way to promote its members to pass it in general in the National Assembly. From a legal point of view, neither the Kuomintang nor the National Government should forcibly dictate how the National Assembly should act. Therefore, if the National Assembly representatives have better opinions on the constitutional issue in terms of national and ethnic interests, they can of course provide them. At the same time, according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, even better opinions can be put forward for research. The rumor that the government guarantees that it can pass the bill in the National Assembly is also not true.

### Minister Bai Tells Our Reporter; Opening of the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee; The Issue of Relief and Reintegration Funding is Decided

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Minister Bai Chongxi told our reporter that the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee closed in the afternoon of the 21st. As a result of the meetings in recent days, all matters related to the recovery of the pacification zone have been thoroughly studied, and the most important issues are relief and reintegration. The funding issue has been decided. In principle, each province will consult with the relevant ministries and departments such as finance, food, water conservancy, and health regarding the needs and finances of the pacification zone under its jurisdiction to determine specific plans and budgets. After approval by the central government, funds will be allocated quickly to carry out the work.

### Yan'an Orders the Communist Armies Inside and Outside the Pass to Prepare for a Large-Scale Offensive; Continuous Cannon Fire Along the Songhua River

[Our Correspondent, Tianjin, 21st] Relevant parties here recently received confidential information that Yan'an issued an order on the 18th for the Communist Armies inside and outside the Pass to launch a large-scale offensive against the National Army before December 25th.

[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 21st] Reporters learned from various sources that a dramatic change will occur again in the Yan'an situation. Officials said that the Communist Army is making major movements everywhere and is preparing. The Communist side has the same accusation against the National Army. However, their opinions differ on where the future focus will be. Observers said that the Communist Party may abandon its base in northern Shaanxi and transform northern Manchuria into a new world. They also said that Yan'an has begun to evacuate. The internal situation in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi is becoming increasingly tense, especially in Shanxi. The Communist Army is actively fighting for favorable strongholds in the Lishi, Zhongyang, Linfen, Yonghe, and Xi County areas on the Shaanxi-Shanxi border. The northern section of the Pinghan Railway in Hebei has returned to a stalemate after a large-scale battle on the 18th with each side deploying 30,000 troops.

[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 21st] Relevant agencies have learned that the situation in the Northeast is gradually becoming tense, and contacts in various places are becoming more frequent. Lin Biao's request to withdraw the Northeast Communist Zone Group has further stimulated this situation. Currently, the Northeast Communist Army is approximately 200,000, with approximately 100,000 scattered throughout Manchuria. The main forces are stationed in Taodouyouzhao and Baichengzi. Eight days ago, the Communist side stopped all passenger and freight transportation, and the main force gradually moved south. Outside the Songhua River, the sound of artillery fire is heard every day.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 21st] Since Zhou Enlai, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, left Nanjing and returned to Yan'an, Yan'an, Dalian, and Harbin have gradually become the centers of the war. Large-scale war preparations seem to have begun in North and Northeast China. Ten more members of the Communist Party of the Military Mediation Headquarters left Peiping by plane today to go to Yan'an. The number of peace representatives left by the Communist Party in Peiping has been reduced to about thirty. Telegrams from Changchun and Shenyang are constantly reporting frequent troop movements by the National Army and the Communist Army in the Dalian and Songhua River defense lines.

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 21st] Communist Party representatives of the Military Mediation Teams in various parts of the Northeast began to concentrate in Changchun on the 21st. There are eight military mediation teams in the Northeast, numbered 27, 28, 29, 30, 33 to 36. They withdrew from areas such as Anshan and Hailong. Li Chuli, the Communist Party representative of the 27th Team in Shenyang, flew to Changchun on the 21st and is said to be waiting for orders in Changchun. If the second withdrawal order arrives, the Communist Party representatives will fly to Harbin. The Communist Army in various places in the Northeast is busy preparing for war, and the National Army is also making defensive preparations. Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, went to Changchun on the 19th. Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Yingpan, who had just arrived in Shenyang, went to Anguang on the 20th. The New 22nd Division will be transferred to Changchun to strengthen the defense of Changchun City. Division Commander Li Tao is currently guarding Haicheng. In addition, the military mediation teams in the Communist Army areas include the Shuangcheng, Qiqihar, and Lafa Frontline teams. The places that Lin Biao referred to as not being able to guarantee safety are these locations.

### Fragments of the National Assembly Presidium Re-election: Chairman Chiang Receives the Most Votes, Mr. Wu Jingheng Announces First; President Dai Faints on the Spot, Alarming the Entire Venue

— Our Reporter Pu Dejie

Three minutes before the meeting, Chairman Chiang, in military attire and holding a cane, entered the venue from the left door with his wife. Chen Lifu casually followed behind, but upon hearing about President Dai's fainting, he rushed to the entrance. Seeing that there was no major problem, he returned to his seat after informing the Chairman and attended the meeting.

Bai Chongxi arrived five minutes before the meeting. When he passed Zeng Qi's seat, they had a cheerful chat. Once he sat down in his seat in the first row, he became the target of news reporters. Chen Cheng, on the other hand, sat in the middle of the middle, talking quietly with his neighbors, inconspicuous and safe.

Miao Jiaming, with a full head of silver hair and gold-rimmed glasses, greeted acquaintances with kindness and sincerity. He walked to the podium, chatted briefly with the active Liu Hengjing, and then sat peacefully in the third row on the left.

President Dai was unwell, and when he entered, he walked weakly, supported by attendants. Before the meeting, he could not hold on and suddenly fainted. He was immediately helped out, got into a car, and returned to his residence to rest. The venue was briefly disturbed, and reporters rushed to the entrance to inquire.

Among the Kuomintang representatives, Chairman Chiang was selected as a candidate for the Presidium. The Nanjing district also unanimously selected Chairman Chiang. The Chairman's intention was to have Nanjing City re-elect, but the representatives of Nanjing City said that the capital is a place where people from all over the country gather, and the national leader should be selected. They decided not to re-elect and firmly requested Chairman Chiang to be a candidate for the Nanjing district, which won a big applause. After consultation by the preparatory committee, Chairman Chiang expressed his acceptance, and the audience applauded again.

For border residents to participate as Presidium candidates, Yang Dizhong, a representative of ethnic minorities in Guizhou, took the lead, causing a heated debate. Some said that it should be based on the election law and names should not be arbitrarily filled in. Some said that 25 million ethnic minorities should not be denied the opportunity to participate in the Presidium. Some said that they resolutely opposed adding units, and some said that they would withdraw if ethnic minorities in the border areas were not valued. The atmosphere was enthusiastic and tense. As a result, Secretary-General Hong reported that Guizhou representative Zhang Daofan had already been elected among the Kuomintang representatives. The elected position in the Guizhou district was abandoned and replaced by Yang Dizhong, so everyone was happy. A blackboard was erected on the left side of the podium, with three large chalk characters written on it: "Yang Dizhong", asking the representatives to correct it during the election.

Shi Qigui, a representative of ethnic minorities from Hunan, spoke, fighting for a seat for a border resident in the Presidium, but he was interrupted by the Chairman's frequent ringing of the bell and a power outage before he finished speaking. He reluctantly walked down from the podium.

During the heated debate, speeches were given very enthusiastically, replacing those who followed the order, depriving the latter of chances. When Hong Lanyou was ordered to report, someone with number 1855 loudly said: "I asked to speak a long time ago, why not let me speak?" Someone replied: "Don't speak." Hong turned around and asked Sun Ke, and then said: "There is still a report." The report resolved the problem, stopping the dispute, and number 1855 did not want to speak anymore.

A representative asked: "Why was Mr. Zhang Ji's candidacy for the Presidium cancelled?" Hong Lanyou said: "I just read it, I'm afraid this representative didn't hear it." "That's not right, it was published in yesterday's evening newspaper, but not in today's daily newspaper. It was read out just now. Why is it so casual to cancel and add?" Hong said: "Mr. Zhang was elected in both the Kuomintang and Hebei district units, so he gave up the Kuomintang aspect. The secretariat of the preparatory committee dared not add anything casually. The news published in the newspapers is not officially released. Everything should be based on the official report." Everyone spoke clearly and harmoniously, and the whole audience applauded silently.

Among the representatives were two big men, one was "Shandong's big man" Yan Guofu, and the other was Huang Zhengqing, the "Arhat" from Tar Temple.

One hundred and thirty-six students from the political school (including two female students) were invited to the meeting as vote counters, all in black cotton uniforms, with green staff passes and temporary venue passes attached to their symbols. They entered in a line, left in a line, and worked silently.

At 4:20 PM, the election began. All reporters were asked to leave the venue in order to count the number of people. For a while, the boxes and lounges were full of reporters. Some said, "It's not allowed." Some said, "Facts require it, it doesn't matter." Some said, "It's the old rule, the Political Consultative Conference is also like this."

The election campaign was heated before the meeting. During the election, the representatives held a pen in one hand and flipped through several different lists in the other, leaning over their small desks, earnestly circling on the ballot papers, like elementary school students taking an exam, flipping through cheat sheets on one side and doing multiple-choice questions on the other, working extremely hard.

At 5:00 PM, the reporters had eaten too many refreshments in the lounge and couldn't help but run out after finishing their conversations. Just as the Chairman and his wife finished voting and walked out of the venue, walking and smiling and nodding, "Good, good." Behind them was a large group of representatives who had finished voting, squeezing out of the boxes. The venue was full of representatives. Chen Lifu and Sun Ke were talking very seriously on the stage. Jiang Biwei, with double buns and a red coat, carrying a black glass handbag, went on stage to receive the inspector's badge. Some representatives were walking out, and some were still sitting in their seats.

After the election, the reporters began to enter. Chen Lifu was first surrounded, talking until the entrance of the Great Hall before breaking through the encirclement and getting into a car at 5:45 PM. In the venue, Hubei representative Deng Yulin was protesting why the votes were not counted publicly in the Great Hall. Hong Lanyou said: "There are too many votes, it's not easy to divide them into groups in the Great Hall. The Political Consultative Conference also counted the votes outside the venue. Fortunately, the ballot boxes are sealed, and there are also vote-supervising representatives. Reporters can visit at will, so it is still public."

There were a total of twelve ballot boxes, three upstairs and nine downstairs. In front of each stood a staff member of the assembly. The lids were sealed with the seal of the assembly, and the mouths were sealed by the four chief vote counters. The first one taken out of the venue was ballot box number three.

The vote counting was done in the conference room on the second floor. The mercury lamps were bright, and the representatives, staff, reporters, and photographers were extremely busy. The chief officials Wu Wangji, Yang Yifeng, Chen Yuke, and Cai Jinying commanded and reported very energetically. Sixty vote counters were divided into fifteen groups. After opening the ballot boxes, they received the ballots separately and worked actively. First, they verified the ballots. The first group to hand in the ballots, a total of ninety-six, completed the vote verification at 8:15 PM. It was counted that 1,467 representatives were elected, 1,446 ballots were issued, 14 abstained, and the total number of votes cast was 1,433, including 34 invalid ballots. The valid ballots, 1,399, were then distributed to each group to start counting and writing ballots. The room was full of the sound of "votes, votes," and the work was very intense. At 9:15 PM, the fifth group was the first to open the votes. As a result, at 2:15 AM on the 22nd, the first president produced was Wu Jingheng, with 802 votes. The person with the most votes was Chairman Chiang, with 1,371 votes. When it was calculated, everyone present applauded together.

The four chief vote counters took turns eating only after the vote counting started. Wu Wangji stood up at 9:00 PM to eat and said: "I can't handle it, it's too troublesome, I'm starving, I'm starving."

The deputy director of the assembly's news group, handsome, young, capable, and enthusiastic to help others, hastily ate a bowl of rice at 8:00 PM and then distributed mimeographed news releases to reporters everywhere: "Here you go." The reporters said: "Thank you, thank you, you are busy enough."

Before the vote counting, the reporters counted 1,467 votes, with 46 people per vote, for a total of 67,482 names. It was estimated that it would take an average of four seconds per name, requiring 75 hours. Dividing it into 15 groups would require five hours, which was the fastest speed. As a result, the vote counting started at 8:30 PM, and the calculation was completed at 10:35 PM on the 22nd. Although the actual number of votes was 69 less than the statistics, it took more than six hours.

At 2:35 AM, the vote counting was completed. The staff, who were extremely tired, and the group of reporters who had waited for most of the night, were surprisingly energetic. After sealing the ballots, everyone said: "Oh, thank God, we have finished a major event, go to sleep quickly, there will be a meeting tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock, it's terrible." (End)

Compatriots across the country: Today is the Seventh National Defense Day. We have just passed the one-year anniversary of victory and restoration, and we are now advancing in national construction and military construction. We are holding this commemoration on this holiday to review the past and learn from our mistakes, strive for innovation, and seek perfection to achieve the ultimate goal. Regarding National Defense construction, the future is both important and huge. In the past, our country was invaded by enemies because our National Defense forces were not fully developed. Although we have achieved victory now, in order to ensure the permanent security of the country and maintain collective world peace, it is necessary to make active efforts in National Defense construction. National Defense is the center of National Defense. In wartime, it will exert its functions and effectiveness. In peacetime, there should be rigorous training and excellent preparation to accumulate self-defense forces and establish self-reliance. Moreover, since the application of atomic energy, National Defense technology has been constantly changing, and it is especially necessary to catch up quickly and make achievements. Then, ensuring security and maintaining peace can be truly effective. Recalling the period of the War of Resistance, the enemy attacked us with its superior air force, and the people's lives and property suffered painful sacrifices. Fortunately, our air force generals and National Defense personnel resisted with great difficulty. All major and small cities also had their reconnaissance and protection organizations, which were able to reduce damage, stabilize people's hearts, and stabilize our front lines. This spirit of generosity, loyalty, and courage is seen by the whole world and is commendable. In the future, we should continue to maintain it and not let it be abandoned, so that we can cope with emergencies one day. However, with the rapid progress of science in the future, if a war breaks out in the world, its form will be very different from the past, and its tragic and brutal nature will be a hundred times greater than in the past. We cannot rely solely on passive protection. We must enrich active National Defense facilities and create a central force for solid National Defense. On the existing foundation, we must cooperate with the country's economy and the progress of National Defense industry to seek the development of air force power. On the one hand, we must strive for scientific research and use the latest defense methods to fundamentally eliminate air strike damage, so that we can survive in the modern world. In addition, how to strengthen public propaganda, popularize National Defense knowledge, how to enrich National Defense equipment, and improve National Defense organizations, so that everyone knows and is aware of danger and is familiar with the strategy of preventing fires before they start, is something that the government and the people should work together to achieve. We have always been known for our love of peace, and we have the responsibility to promote world peace. We never want any country to suffer war again and make the people suffer again. However, National Defense preparation is what a country relies on for its security, and it is also a guarantee for consolidating world peace. We must be prepared for danger in times of peace, and plan thoroughly and in detail to achieve the goal of perfection, so that we can be prepared and avoid being despised. This is not only the end of National Defense. I hope that people across the country will pay attention to it, and the entire National Defense construction should also be planned and completed together by everyone. Let us encourage each other.

### Malaysian Overseas Chinese Face Discrimination: Rubber Industry Suffers Severe Losses: Chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce Files a Complaint

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 20th] Due to mismanagement and discrimination by local governments and the British Ministry of Trade, Chinese businessmen operating rubber businesses in Malaya have suffered serious losses since August. Li Guangqian, chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and a rubber industry tycoon, stated in a letter to Askolly, chairman of the United Rubber Planters Association of London, that the procurement system of the Trade Bureau in August and September was extremely unfair. Even if not intentional, in fact, there has been discrimination, which has been detrimental to local rubber producers and sellers. The Trade Department's reason is that it lacks transportation, so it has not been able to purchase rubber in Malaya. However, Li said: Any businessman in the local business community believes that if the Trade Department can express its willingness to abide by its promise to purchase local rubber, any amount of rubber can be transported to London. As far as I know, one company, unfortunately, lost a quarter of its capital, while another company lost more than 500,000 yuan. He suggested that tens of thousands of pounds originally allocated to Malaya for war expenses before Japan surrendered should be allocated for local reconstruction.

### International Wool Conference: Purpose and Results: Zhang Tianze Discusses His Attendance

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] A Central News Agency reporter met today with Zhang Tianze, director of the International Trade Company of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who represented our country at the International Wool Conference. Zhang told the reporter about the purpose and results of the meeting. He said: This conference lasted six days, from November 11th to 16th. Participants were representatives from 13 countries that produce or consume wool. Its purpose was to discuss methods to avoid market stagnation due to the large amount of wool stockpiled by various countries. The United Kingdom alone has more than 3 billion pounds of wool in storage, and the total amount worldwide is about 5 billion pounds. It is estimated that the amount of stored wool is sufficient for 8 to 13 years of consumption. Therefore, the conference decided to organize an international research group to discuss various details in the future. Zhang said when talking about the situation of wool in our country: Although China is not an important wool-producing country compared to other countries, since Chinese wool is mainly used for carpets, it is expected that the world's demand for carpet wool will increase significantly after the war. China is also unable to occupy an important position among refined wool consuming countries because the domestic wool textile industry is still in the initial stage of development. However, China is currently determined to develop the wool textile industry and increase the production of wool yarn and flannel to meet domestic consumption. Hankou, Shanghai, as well as Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Peiping will become important centers of China's textile industry. Zhang said: He had reported to the conference that China's comprehensive development of the wool textile industry will take many years, and it will be an important responsibility for the consumption of refined wool in the world. In order to accelerate the development of the wool textile industry, China welcomes foreign technology and investment in machinery and equipment.

### Friendly Treaty Signed with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Nationals of Both Countries to Enjoy Most-Favored-Nation Treatment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Diplomatic circles report: A friendly treaty between our country and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was signed in Jeddah on the 16th of this month. It has been noted that many of our Muslim citizens travel to Mecca, the Islamic holy land within Saudi Arabia, each year for the Hajj pilgrimage. However, due to the absence of a treaty between the two countries, their stay in Saudi Arabia has been inconvenient. In particular, if a pilgrim dies in Saudi Arabia, their estate is managed by the Saudi government and cannot be transferred to the deceased's heirs, resulting in substantial losses. Since June of the 31st year [of the Republic], the two countries have been in contact to establish a friendly treaty, with negotiations ongoing until an agreed draft was finalized and formally signed. It has been learned that in addition to standard provisions on dispatching envoys and establishing consulates, the treaty specifies the following two points: (1) Nationals of either contracting party residing or traveling within the territory of the other contracting party shall enjoy most-favored-nation treatment regarding the protection of their persons and property; (2) In the event of the death of a national of either contracting party within the territory of the other contracting party, if there is no legal guardian for their estate, it shall be handed over to the nearest consular official of their home country for transfer to the deceased's legal heirs. The treaty shall come into effect upon the exchange of instruments of ratification. In the future, the friendly relations between the two countries will undoubtedly be further enhanced as a result.

### Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Suffering Deeply: Frequent Robberies Ignored by Officials; Over 10,000 Killed in Conflicts Between French and Vietnamese Troops

[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 21st] The 600,000 overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam have recently been struggling to survive under near-constant robbery and terror. According to Mr. Chen Zhao-cheng, Chairman of the Annam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, who returned here to attend the inaugural meeting of the South Seas Overseas Chinese Economic Development Corporation: In Saigon, the economic center of Vietnam, the 400,000 overseas Chinese living in the suburbs universally regard sunset as an ominous symbol, as large-scale armed robberies commonly occur every night after 8:00 PM. Often, dozens or even hundreds of thugs set up machine guns at both ends of the street and ransack homes without restraint until dawn. Initially, wealthy overseas Chinese were targeted for extortion, but later, both rich and poor suffered the same fate, with even furniture and clothing being cleared out. French and Vietnamese officials turn a blind eye, and even when overseas Chinese report incidents to the police, they are ignored. Mr. Chen left Vietnam on October 27th to attend the National Federation of Commerce and Industry meeting in the capital and flew to Xiamen on the 19th of this month to attend the inaugural meeting of the Economic Development Corporation. He reports that in the areas of Qi Huong City, Binh Phuoc City and Dang Village in Vietnam, Chinese suffered terribly as French troops burned villages and massacred more than ten thousand overseas Chinese in the conflicts between the French and Vietnamese. The situation was especially bad in Phu Tho Village, an industrial area where many overseas Chinese were involved in the leather industry. When a French soldier was killed by a Vietnamese citizen, the area was surrounded by French troops, and countless overseas Chinese were brutally killed. Houses and factories were destroyed. The devastation was even worse than in occupied areas during wartime. Therefore, the overseas Chinese in Vietnam now hope that the government will negotiate with the French authorities to fulfill the Sino-French New Treaty signed last November, guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again, and compensate the overseas Chinese for their losses.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 21st] As French and Vietnamese authorities were negotiating to cease all hostilities, clashes between French and Vietnamese troops occurred in the city of Haiphong on the 20th. According to initial reports received here, the clashes began at the Cai Market when Vietnamese forces opened fire first, killing three French soldiers who were unable to resist. The conflict quickly spread throughout the city, and traffic between Hanoi and Haiphong has been completely cut off. It is reported that the clashes were triggered by disagreements between French and Vietnamese authorities over customs duties in Haiphong. As of the time of this dispatch, the conflict in Haiphong has not yet ceased.

### Some Traitorous Han Chinese Cause Trouble in the Beijing Prison; Traitor Zhou Fo-hai and Others Riot in Jail; Traitor Li Shao-tang Falls Ill and Requests Medical Release

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] A bizarre prison riot occurred at the Tiger Street Prison in the capital on the 20th. Traitor Zhou Fo-hai led the inmates in a protest to prison officials. The incident stemmed from the fact that the traitor Li Shao-tang, who is in custody, was suffering from bladder inflammation and had been unable to urinate for two days. His family requested his release for medical treatment, but the request had not yet been approved. A group of inmates expressed their dissatisfaction, with the traitor Zhou leading the disturbance. Prosecutor Gong went to investigate, and the traitor Zhou stated, "Law is law," "Humanity is humanity," "Execution is execution," "Medical treatment is medical treatment," and delivered a passionate speech. The traitor Zhou Quan-sun, who had already been sentenced to death, also chimed in. After the prosecutor explained the situation, the inmates calmed down. The High Court is currently reviewing the matter.

### Traitors Zhou, Pan, Li, and Others Prepare to Apply for Retrial

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] After the traitor Zhou Fo-hai was sentenced to death, his wife, Yang She-hui, commissioned lawyer Yang Jia-lin on the 20th to review Zhou Fo-hai's case file at the Capital High Court in preparation for filing an application for retrial. The traitor Pan Yu-gui, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, has also commissioned lawyers Ye Zai-hang and Yang Jia-lin to prepare an application for retrial. The prosecutor in Pan's case believes that the sentence was too lenient and is also preparing to apply for retrial. After the traitor Xia Yuan-zhi was acquitted, the prosecutor has also submitted an application for retrial to the High Court. In addition, the Supreme Court sent traitor Li Sheng-wu's case back for retrial, and his wife has hired lawyer Dai Xiu-zan to defend him in the retrial.

### Editorial: A Comparison of Facts

Since the CCP representative Zhou Enlai returned to Yan'an, the negotiations between the KMT and the CCP have come to an end. In order to fully demonstrate the spirit of "doing its utmost," the government, on the one hand, has been enacting a practical and feasible democratic constitution through the National Assembly and, on the other hand, has been actively consulting on the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan. The Standing Committee of the Central Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council also passed the draft National Government Organization Law on the 20th. The number of members of the Government Committee is set at 40, and the Executive Yuan is expanded to 38 ministries and commissions. The candidates for ministers of each ministry and chairmen of each commission have also been internally determined in order. It is hoped that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference will be fully implemented, and it is hoped that the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly will not present any problems. The political situation in recent days seems to have become clearer, giving the general public, who long for peace and democracy, a sense that the future of the political situation is very promising. However, on the CCP side, its conscience is blinded by the private interests of one party, and it does not think much about the future of the country and the nation. It is still there, doing everything possible to launch a propaganda offensive, on the one hand attempting to undermine the National Assembly in completing its sacred duty of drafting a constitution, and on the other hand fantasizing that the National Army is attacking Yan'an. It wants to give people at home and abroad who do not understand the truth the impression that the entire China has been shrouded in the shadow of civil war and that there is no hope of becoming a strong, democratic, and unified China. It is not worth mentioning that a few foreigners may believe it because they do not understand the inside story of Chinese politics; but there are still some newspapers in the country that are willing to promote the CCP's propaganda offensive and claim to be "impartial public opinion." It really makes our people unable to understand.

The so-called facts speak louder than words. Let us list the facts of what the government and the CCP have done in the past month and make a comparison. The right and wrong, black and white, will be clear and self-evident. In the process of more than a year of negotiations, the government has always held a spirit of tolerance and is willing to compromise for the sake of completeness, but repeated compromises have not achieved "completeness." Even when the peace talks reached the end of the road, the government still put the country first and demonstrated the spirit of "doing its utmost" everywhere. All actions are based on public opinion. Because the people yearn for peace, the government automatically and unconditionally ordered a ceasefire; and because the people seek democracy, the government has long had the determination to return power to the people, so it decided to convene the National Assembly and draft a practical and feasible democratic constitution to lay the foundation for the rule of law and democracy in our country. On the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, the government had reached the point where it could no longer tolerate or compromise. However, at the request of the third party, the government postponed the meeting by three days. The government did not care about the CCP's shouts, abuses, and ridicule. It completely handled national affairs with a selfless and impartial mind. It was open and honest and there was really nothing to criticize or criticize.

Looking back at the CCP, when the battle in Zhangjiakou was urgent, it demanded peace and shouted loudly for "unconditional ceasefire." After the government truly issued a ceasefire order, the CCP bandits and spies refused to issue a ceasefire order at the same time and opposed the government's issuance of a ceasefire order. It even took advantage of the National Army's "guarding the original defense" to launch a large-scale counterattack on all fronts. The recurrence of the war in Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, and even northern Jiangsu was entirely due to the CCP's adoption of an offensive strategy. Similarly, the CCP demanded democracy and repeatedly insisted on convening the National Assembly to draft a constitution and demanded the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan to establish a united national government; but when the government was about to reorganize the government and convene the National Assembly, the CCP's argument suddenly changed, first arguing about the number of government committee members and the exercise of veto power; later, it simply refused to submit the list of National Assembly representatives, so that the National Assembly, which was scheduled to open on May 5, could not be held as scheduled, and a new constitution could not be produced; later, the government decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12. The CCP has always expressed opposition, and no matter how much the government compromises and asks the CCP to participate, the CCP's attitude is stubborn and it will never participate under any conditions. Now the National Assembly has opened, the government still reserves its seats and hopes that it will wake up and submit a list of representatives at any time to participate in the National Assembly. However, the CCP is still obsessed and doing everything possible to undermine the success of the National Assembly, using all means. In its verbal propaganda, it calls the National Assembly "illegal" and declares that it will not recognize the future constitution; at the same time, in fact, it is hindering others from participating in the National Assembly. Now the CCP has gone a step further and is publicizing at home and abroad that the National Army is attacking Yan'an, trying to put the responsibility for the breakdown of peace talks and the outbreak of war entirely on the government.

In short, after reading the above comparison of facts, we know that no one except those with ulterior motives will believe the CCP's claim that the National Army is attacking Yan'an. The CCP's propaganda offensive is obviously going to fall "flat" again; but after reading the CCP's recent "frequent mobilizations" in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, although the CCP claims to be "evacuating," it can also be seen that the CCP's propaganda offensive will be the prelude to its launch of a military offensive. The CCP's approach is only disappointing and tantamount to cutting itself off from the people of the country; we really feel sorry for the CCP. In fact, there are many enlightened people in the CCP, why must they take this step!

### The Promotion of Racial Equality

——The Passage of the Egyptian Proposal

With the collapse of Fascism, the theory of superior nations is no longer valued. According to recent research by anthropologists, while there are differences in intelligence and foolishness among individuals in the world, there are no differences in superiority or inferiority between nations. According to a special cable from the CCP's New York correspondent on the 19th, the United Nations General Assembly held its first vote of 54 countries and unanimously passed the resolution proposed by Egypt, asking all governments to immediately stop religious and racial persecution and discrimination. Although the Egyptian proposal did not list facts or contribute concrete methods, the passage of this proposal, as the Indian representative said, is "a major step in affirming that all human beings are completely equal, regardless of whether they are white, black, or yellow."

Since there is no superiority or inferiority among races, they should enjoy equal treatment. Using the myth of a superior nation to bully the weak and the few is the style of European imperialism in the 19th century, and it is also the tyranny of the Fascist group. Although Fascism has failed, racial discrimination has not been completely eliminated. For example, the Union of South Africa has 60 laws restricting the freedom of Indians within its borders. Public buses, trains, post offices, and parks must be separated from Europeans everywhere. Two million Europeans can elect 150 parliamentary representatives, while 250,000 Indians can only elect three representatives, and the representatives must be Europeans. Another example is the Republic of the Philippines, since its establishment, has passed three types of bills regarding retailers, laborers, and market vendors, depriving overseas Chinese of the opportunity to survive, and refusing overseas Chinese from entering the Philippines. The military and police can arrest them at will, and the Ministry of the Interior even has a Chinatown plan. Actions such as this racial discrimination fundamentally violate the spirit of democracy.

The spirit of democracy should be freedom, equality, and fraternity. The policy of racial discrimination restricts freedom, cancels equality, and fundamentally does not talk about fraternity. Therefore, the Union of South Africa and the Republic of the Philippines cannot be considered true democratic countries. When the Egyptian proposal was passed, it was unanimously passed, and the only opponent was South African Prime Minister Smuts. Smuts recently also suggested to the United Nations Trusteeship Council that he wanted to annex Southwest Africa, and declared that if the United Nations Trusteeship Council did not pass it, he would take direct action. Smuts' undemocratic performance and imperialist style in the Union of South Africa will certainly be subject to the criticism and sanctions of world opinion. As for the Philippine representative, since he agreed to this proposal, he should no longer impose unfair oppression on overseas Chinese within the country in the future, and bills such as those regarding retailers, laborers, and market vendors can be avoided.

Europe has gone through a long period of religious wars, and today religious discrimination has long become a thing of the past. However, because of the different races, they often believe in different religions. Even within the same race, there may be different religious beliefs. Because of different religions, it often leads to fierce conflicts. This situation is particularly evident in India. The conflict between India and Islam has killed and injured tens of thousands of people to date. Even after the leader of the Muslims joined the provisional government, he could not stop the bloody fighting in various places. As for the Indians, because of religion, they are divided into five strictly different classes, among which the untouchable class is the most oppressed and never has the opportunity to turn over. These religious discriminations are the main factors causing internal disputes in India.

In the thousands of years of Chinese history, one thing that is worth our pride is that there has been no religious war. Although Confucian philosophy has been supported by successive governments, other religions have also coexisted. As for race, the Chinese sages, whether Confucian, Buddhist, or Taoist, all have the spirit of fraternity, equality, and freedom, and never advocate any discrimination. In the past, China was able to maintain a vast empire and preserve a long-standing culture, all thanks to this broad tolerance and a healthy outlook on life and the universe. Our chief representative Gu Weijun specially quoted Confucius's famous saying "All within the four seas are brothers" at the United Nations General Assembly, which won applause from the entire audience at the time. Professor Pei Fei from the United States gave a lecture at Tongji University in Shanghai a month ago, and also pointed out the relationship between Einstein's world and Confucius's world. The former world studies "people and things," while the latter world studies "people and people." According to Professor Pei Fei's view, the most serious problem in the world today is to study the relationship between "people and people." Human beings must live in harmony and must have the spirit of freedom, equality, and fraternity. The proposal of the Egyptian representative is the voice of human justice, and the unanimous agreement of 53 countries is also a harbinger of harmonious coexistence among human beings.

### Poor Sales and Rampant Usury: A Wave of Business Bankruptcies in Suzhou; Even Established Old Shops of Decades Struggle to Survive

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] In recent days, a wave of business bankruptcies has swept through Suzhou like a sudden surge, and it is unstoppable. Specifically, more than ten shops, including Jinbu Qianzhuang, Xiehu Pihuo Hang, and Jiucheng Shan Hang, all long-established businesses with decades of operation, have closed down one after another. The losses are all over 100 million yuan, and people from all walks of life are worried about the future of commerce. On the 21st, our newspaper reporter paid a special visit to the person in charge of the County Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the statistics of business bankruptcies in the past two months and the causes of the problems. According to reports, from July to the end of September, the total number of business bankruptcies in this county has exceeded 460, including five gold and silver shops, four mountain goods shops, two automobile shops, four edible oil shops, nine oil and wine shops, five tea shops, five new medicine shops, five tea snack shops, eight Shaoxing wine shops, four foundry shops, seven wood shops, Guokeng steel shops, ten tung oilseed cake shops, twenty-eight cloth shops, three native cloth shops, three lime brick and tile shops, firewood shops, four transportation shops, eleven vegetable and rice restaurants, six preserved meat shops, 160 grain shops, 161 flour shops, and five flour mills that are also planning to close down. From October to the present, according to unofficial statistics, there are still more than 100 businesses from various industries that have closed down one after another. There are four main causes: (1) scarcity of raw materials, (2) poor sales, (3) high wages, and (4) usurious exploitation. There are also other minor factors, such as excessive taxation, which have also contributed to the accelerated collapse. At present, business people generally hope that the government can provide widespread low-interest loans to treat the symptoms and quickly plan for smooth transportation to treat the root cause. With both symptomatic and root causes treated, there may be a glimmer of hope for commercial and economic recovery.

### Several County Magistrates in Jiangsu Province Penalized

For failing to conduct a proper review of public office candidates

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] The Jiangsu Provincial Government had previously ordered the counties under its jurisdiction to complete the review of public office candidates by the end of October in order to establish civil-constitutional organizations at all levels and begin elections. Since the deadline has passed for many days, only more than ten counties, including Jiangning and Wuxian, have complied. Such continued delays will indefinitely postpone the establishment of public opinion organizations. A disciplinary order has been issued to show vigilance, with Zhang Meng-tao, the county magistrate of Zhenjiang County, Sun Dan-xin, the county magistrate of Wujin County, Zhang Ding, the county magistrate of Gaochun County, and Xu Zhu-yi, the county magistrate of Jiading County, each receiving a demerit.

### Zhejiang Highway Leasing: Bidding to be Organized by Region

The Fuyang-Xindeng Line has already opened to traffic yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou News] The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Transportation has been ordered to be reorganized into a bureau by the end of the year, subordinate to the Department of Construction, to manage highway construction and transportation affairs throughout the province.

In addition, the highway between Fuyang and Xindeng has been completed, and the test run was good. It was decided to resume traffic on the 21st, with two round trips per day.

### Public Trial of Sack Smuggling Case Held the Day Before Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi News] During the victory celebration last year, eight sack shops, including Demao on Beitang Jiyu Street, used armed force to smuggle 200,000 sacks from the enemy companies Mitsui and Sanmeng. Later, neighbor Zhu Yu-lin reported it to the local court, and the investigation involved Shen Dun-hui and Zhang Zai-hao, investigators from the Enemy Property Handling Bureau. Subsequently, the prosecutor's office summoned the owners of the eight sack shops and Shen and Zhang to the court for interrogation. Due to the seriousness of the suspicion, they were all released on bail. After investigation, the prosecutor believed that the eight shop owners had committed the crime of illegally occupying stolen goods, and the two investigators Shen and Zhang had committed the crime of assisting in illegal occupation. The prosecutor then filed a public prosecution with the criminal court of the same court. The 20th was the date for the first public trial of the case. The plaintiff Zhu Yu-lin, the witness Yuan Fu-nan, and the ten defendants, including Zhu Yu-lin, all complied with the summons and appeared in court to await trial. Judge Wu Shu-tang opened the court for trial. As a result, due to the complexity of the case, it still needs to be adjourned for continued questioning. The plaintiff and witnesses were all ordered to return, and the defendants were still released on bail awaiting trial.

### Ningbo Farmers' Association Demands Abolition of Sewage Contracting

[Our Newspaper, Ningbo News] The sewage of this county's urban area has always been handled by contractors. Over the years, the contractors have only sought to enrich themselves, disregarding public health, causing constant complaints from the local community. Local public organizations have repeatedly petitioned for improvements. It is now learned that the contractor's contract for this year expires at the end of this month. It is rumored that the contractors are secretly trying to continue the contract, and the County Health Affairs Committee also seems agreeable. The County Farmers' Association learned of this matter and held a special meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss it. It was resolved that contracting out to merchants would increase the burden on farmers, and the association expressed its opposition, demanding the abolition of the contractor system and its replacement by farmer operation. Chairman Hu was appointed to negotiate with the county government, along with Director Chen Yinglie.

### Anhui Province Tax Collection Situation: Disaster-Stricken Counties Granted Separate Reductions, Few Payments Made, Intensified Supervision Urged

[Our Newspaper, Hefei News] Our reporter recently learned the following about the collection of land tax in Anhui Province this year: (1) The total provincial tax quota is 12,972,395 silver dollars. According to the rate of three dou of grain collected per silver dollar, plus one dou of requisitioned military grain and nine sheng of provincial and county public grain, a total of 5,688,841 shi of grain (referring to rice) should be collected. Due to the late determination of the collection rate and the severe bandit and flood disasters in northeastern Anhui, as of the 10th of this month, the reported amount collected by various counties was only over 200,000 shi, far from the required amount. (2) Due to the disasters in Xuyi, Tianchang, Sixian, Lingbi, Fengyang, and Suxian counties in northeastern Anhui, the central government has approved temporary postponement of tax collection, totaling a reduction of over 600,000 shi of grain. (3) According to the collection situation in previous years, there are always cases of escaped, deceased, and impoverished households that cannot be collected, accounting for about 20% of the total tax amount. This year will likely be no exception, with an estimated reduction of 900,000 shi of grain. (4) This year, the area affected by floods and insect plagues in the province is very wide. In addition to northeastern Anhui, there are also Quanjiao, Hexian, Shucheng, Wujiang, Tongcheng, Taihu, Susong, Tongling, Qingyang, Jixi, Qimen, Dangtu, Langxi, Guangde, and Taiping counties, with an estimated reduction of 800,000 shi of grain. (5) The excessive collections in the 33rd year and the pre-borrowed military grain in the 34th year should be deducted from the new tax of this year to return to the people, approximately reducing the grain amount by over 400,000 shi. (6) After deducting the above-mentioned reduced grain amounts, the actual collection this year can reach over 2.9 million shi. (7) In this province, there are 19 districts including Yuexi, Zhide, Jingde, Ningguo, and Shouxian that use legal tender to offset grain collection. Among these 19 districts, either the whole district uses legal tender to offset, or a portion of the district does. The amount offset is equivalent to over 290,000 shi of grain. (8) The central government has set a deadline of the end of December to collect everything. With the deadline approaching, the Provincial Field and Grain Department has dispatched all staff to various districts to supervise the collection. The provincial government will also organize three roving supervision teams (headed by directors or committee members from various provincial departments) to set out for regional supervision and order each district to organize supervision teams, dividing responsibilities to ensure collective completion by the deadline, in order to achieve full collection on time. (9) To prevent corruption by grain administration personnel in various districts, supervisory committees are to be organized by district councils, party groups, and local impartial gentry to prevent problems from the outset.

### Jiaxing Conscription Begins Delivery

[Our Newspaper, Jiaxing News] This county's conscription quota for this year is 555 men. The county magistrate has ordered the townships to complete the conscription within a limited time. The townships have now sent volunteers to the county for inspection. As of the 19th, over 300 have passed the inspection. The first batch of recruits, one company of 196 men, is scheduled to be delivered on the 30th and will be received by a team from the Jiaxing Garrison District Command.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin News] Cheng County was ordered to conscript, but still has a shortfall of 280 able-bodied men. The Wuxi Garrison District Command has repeatedly urged delivery, but the quota has not yet been met. The Garrison District Command believes that this matter concerns the entire conscription policy, so on the 20th, it specially sent the third section chief, Zang Xingwu, to Cheng to oversee the process, extending the deadline to the 25th.

### Inside Story of the Popular Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (標會) in Shanghai

Reading the newspaper, I saw that the Municipal Council's Police Affairs Committee held its fourth meeting on the 16th of this month to discuss the prohibition of rotating savings and credit associations (標會). The councilors' opinions on the prohibition of 標會 were not fully detailed. The councilors come from the people, but unfortunately, they are somewhat out of touch with the people's hardships. It must be known that the harm of 標會 is worse than that of flower societies (花會), and the number of victims is in the tens of thousands. It is too late to try to crack down on it; prevention is better than cure. I, a humble member of the common people and a civil servant, often go into the community and have a more intimate understanding of the situation. I would like to outline the situation of 標會 in this city. These are facts recognized by millions of citizens, and they are absolutely true. I hope that the councilors of the Police Affairs Committee will take decisive action to eliminate this harm to the people. The lesson of Zhang Wu Po in Hankou is not far away; please do not dismiss this as alarmist talk.

(1) Idlers Solicit Association, Heavy Interest Exaction Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the practice of 標會 in this city has become extremely popular. A class of unemployed idlers has arisen, relying on their evil influence to forcibly solicit association and act as the head of the association (會首), turning the collected association funds into high-interest loans (俗稱 印子錢). For example, if an association has 100 members, each person contributes 100,000 yuan for the first payment, totaling 10 million yuan. The head of the association receives this initial income and lends it to others, earning at least 3 jiao and at most 6 jiao of interest per yuan per month. In short, at least 3 million yuan of illegal profit can be earned per 10 million yuan. 標會 are held once a month, and only 100,000 yuan needs to be paid each time. This kind of business with no capital is easy to do, so idlers who used to lack food and clothing have suddenly become nouveau riche, living in luxury and splendor, envied by everyone. Not only are poor civil servants unable to keep up, but even wealthy families sigh that they cannot match it.

(2) Absconding with Funds, Utterly Devoid of Conscience Since the practice of 標會 has become popular for a time, where there are great profits, the masses follow suit. You solicit my association, and I solicit yours, becoming association principals (寶主) in turn, continuously and endlessly. In teahouses and restaurants, one only hears the sound of 標會. The authorities have never stopped it. The amount of 標會 funds is surprisingly large. Because idlers who win the funds can profit from high-interest loans, they are willing to bid high. Therefore, each idler, according to their ability, pulls together to become an association head, with each person having at most ten-odd associations and participating in at least dozens of other people's associations. By collecting the initial association fee (頭會) and the bidded funds (標會), they absorb cash in astonishing amounts. Once their goal is achieved, they develop bad intentions and announce the collapse of the association (倒會). These people have neither permanent jobs nor permanent property, so they take everything they have and flee.

(3) Women of Good Families Suffer the Most Since the huge fraud case of Zhang Wu Po in Hankou, the idler-organized 標會 in this city have begun to waver. From August of this year to the present, every association formed by idlers has collapsed. There is some interaction among the idlers, and the debts from the collapsed associations can be offset. The most miserable are the women of ordinary families, who usually scrimp and save, even borrowing money to participate in the association. Once the association collapses, a lifetime of hard work is lost. When you ask them for money, they say that even banks are closing and shops must shut down, let alone small 標會. When you report to the authorities, the officials say, "Who told you to join the association? We don't care." As a result, the victims have nowhere to cry for help, and some have committed suicide out of grief and indignation. Moreover, these idlers are all shameless people. Once they see that the government doesn't care, they naturally become bolder. At first, they would go out to avoid the storm, but later, they would come out in the open. What can you do to them? They also hide their property and pretend to be poor, and you can't do anything to them!

(4) Treat the Symptoms Urgently, Severely Punish the Association Heads "A life for a life, debt must be repaid," as the ancient saying goes, still holds true today. Rogues use their evil influence to defraud people of their wealth, exact heavy interest, and do not have to risk their lives to seize huge sums of money. Their methods are ruthless and more harmful than bandits who rob with open fire! Prohibiting 標會 can only prevent problems before they occur. Now, accept reports from the people, immediately detain the rogue association heads, severely punish them according to the crime of robbery, and order them to hand over the hidden property to compensate the victims. At the same time, strictly prohibit 標會, so that both the root and the symptoms are treated (ordinary citizens who are forced to solicit associations due to poor turnover are an exception). If we only discuss banning 標會 and ignore the existing associations, it would be like dropping a pot and not caring about it. Why bother trying to lock the stable door after the horse has bolted? Therefore, treating the symptoms now is urgently needed.

Finally, police authorities and councilor gentlemen, please have great compassion and use the power of a thunderbolt to take back the people's wealth from the hands of the thugs? (Citizen Xu Wu)

### A Tragedy of an Old Father Being Killed

I am from Gugao Town, Fifth District, Taixian County, Northern Jiangsu. Since the bandits and communists occupied the area, my family has been impoverished. In May of this year, they divided all of our fields and property. The people in my family fled to relatives' homes to take refuge. (I was originally the principal of the Songjiang County Central School, but later, because my wife fled, I could not maintain a living, so I came to Shanghai to work in a private school.) Today, I received a terrible message that the bandits and communists shot my loyal and cowardly 50-year-old father for no reason! My father, Gu Guilin, is a well-known honest man in the village. Dividing his property was not enough; they had to shoot my father. Such a policy of the communists is utterly devoid of conscience. Please publish this actual situation to seek justice for this bloody injustice. (Gu Rubo)

### Mine Workers' Contract Expired Last Night, US Coal Mines Prepare for General Strike, Labor Federation Expresses Determination to Back Them, Army Ordered to Coal Mining Areas to Maintain Order

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The 400,000 coal miners in the United States are scheduled to begin their second major strike at midnight today. Now that the deadline has passed by one minute, Miners Union leader Lewis still insists on his principle of "no contract, no work" and has shown no signs of retreating. According to officials, the strike will reduce industrial production and force factories with no coal storage to shut down.

[Reuters, New York, 21st] President Truman, who is currently on vacation, has ordered Attorney General Clark to issue a subpoena to Lewis after the miners went on strike at midnight yesterday because their leader Lewis refused to withdraw his notice of termination of the contract, accusing him of contempt of court and sentencing him accordingly. Whether the miners will actually go on strike will only be determined when the day shift begins work at 11 a.m. this morning (7 p.m. Shanghai time), as night shift workers account for only a very small proportion.

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] Miners Union President Lewis refused to comply with the government's strike ban today, so a general strike is brewing in the nation's bituminous coal mines, with 132,550 miners already on strike. According to Lewis's announcement, the miners' contract expires at midnight today, at which time 400,000 miners nationwide will be affected. Government authorities met today, but it is not yet known whether Lewis will be arrested and imprisoned or whether other measures will be taken. Some government officials are deeply concerned that Lewis's imprisonment will incite a general demonstration by the union.

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] The Department of the Army is prepared to send troops to the coal mines within hours at the request of the Secretary of the Interior. This action by the army is likely to be a police task.

[Agence France-Presse, Atlantic City, 20th] Regarding the US government's attitude towards Miners Union President Lewis, US Labor Federation President Green commented that even if the government uses bayonets or imprisonment to intimidate workers, it will not be able to make the miners produce a ton of coal. Any attempt to use force against the miners will only arouse sympathy for the strike from other unions affiliated with the Labor Federation. It is improper for the government not to submit the current dispute to the Department of Labor or the Arbitration Board for resolution. It has been announced that the Congress of Industrial Organizations has declared that its affiliated unions are pledged to support the miners. The two major labor groups in the United States have joined hands to support Lewis in an effort to crush the government's attempt to prevent the coal mine strike, as can be seen from this. According to well-informed sources, the US government has begun to fight the unions to the end.

### Foreign Troops Issue Reopened, US Representative Connally's Sharp Words, Rebuttal to Molotov's Speech

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 21st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin is expected to reply to Molotov's request yesterday to investigate foreign troops in the Political Committee of the General Assembly today. A spokesman for the US delegation said that although the United States is willing to report the number of foreign troops, it does not include the number of naval and air force troops. However, both Britain and the United States believe that if the Military Staff Committee needs information, then this information should include reports on all foreign troops, including garrisons.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 20th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suddenly appeared at the Political Committee of the General Assembly today, expressing his views on the issue of troops stationed in non-enemy countries. He pointed out that under certain circumstances, the stationing of foreign troops in non-enemy countries is a method of interfering in the internal affairs of that country. He believes that Allied troops should not be stationed in Allied countries unless it is necessary to maintain transportation. He further pointed out that although Soviet troops have withdrawn from China, Norway, Yugoslavia, and Iran, British and American troops are still stationed in non-enemy countries in Europe, Asia, and South America. Molotov then suggested that the General Assembly ask the Security Council to request the member states of the United Nations to submit the following reports within one month: (1) In which non-enemy territories do member states have troops stationed, and how many? (2) In which former enemy territories do member states have troops stationed, and how many? (3) Where are the garrisons and naval defenses that member states have previously and recently established located? Molotov said that there are still a small number of Soviet troops in Poland to maintain transportation lines to Germany, and that Soviet troops in northern Korea are stationed in accordance with agreements with Allied countries. In contrast, British and American troops are still stationed in various parts of Europe, Asia, and South America long after the war has ended, and their air bases are even more densely distributed around the world, and some countries feel particularly interested in the two poles. The Soviet government suggested to the Security Council within eight days that member states submit reports on the stationing of troops in non-enemy territories. The Soviet Union is willing to fulfill this obligation and hopes that other countries will also agree to seek the common interests of the world.

US Representative Connally then spoke, solemnly denying that the stationing of US troops in other countries has caused unease. He stated that the number of US troops stationed abroad was 5 million at the end of the war, but has now been reduced to 800,000. Connally, only two chairs away from Molotov, slammed the table at the end of his speech and said, "We want the world to know where our troops are stationed, because wherever our troops are stationed, there is no threat to world peace. They carry the white flag of promoting a peaceful and united agreement to improve international welfare." Connally also demanded that the investigation of stationed troops should include all troops in the world. He said that soldiers carrying bayonets, whether in their own country or in a foreign country, are a threat to peace. Finally, British representative Cadogan expressed his opinion, "I believe that the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet representative is limited to armed forces stationed abroad, which is not sufficient. Therefore, I propose establishing a Staff Committee to collect all information on this issue."

### Four Foreign Ministers Continue to Discuss the Trieste Issue

Italy Prepared for Direct Negotiations

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 20th] The four foreign ministers met today to continue studying the French draft on the status of Trieste, agreeing that the Governor of Trieste has special privileges in diplomatic policy and legal issues. The meeting adopted the Soviet proposal to establish a free port in Trieste and decided that the constitution of Trieste does not need to be approved by the Security Council. Before adjourning, the thorny issue of Trieste's economic system was studied, and discussions will continue tomorrow.

### The Northern Border of Greece: Fierce Fighting Continues, Guerrillas Appear to Receive Foreign Support

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 21st] The Greek intelligence officer stationed in the United States issued last night the official report of his government regarding the border conflict, stating briefly that, from September 9th to November 19th of this year, Greek territory was attacked by guerrillas a total of 33 times. This kind of aggression is an undeclared war and endangers peace. The guerrilla thugs come from the two countries of South Bulgaria and Albania, perhaps with the tacit consent of those governments.

[Reuters, Athens, 20th] Authoritative sources claim: The Greek government intends to appeal directly to the UN General Assembly regarding foreign interference in the Greek civil war, according to Article 14 of the United Nations Charter, and does not intend to directly negotiate with Yugoslavia, Bulgaria or Albania in advance. It is understood that the rebel army making trouble in Greece comes from the Lialun area on the southern border of Greece, and they invaded a village in Macedonia again yesterday. Fierce fighting at Skrach is still ongoing. General Fantoulis, commander of the Greek Third Army, who is supervising the battle there, has ordered the establishment of large artillery teams at the Greek border outposts, especially in the Douralen area, to prevent new offensives from that direction.

### Investigation Report on Japanese Reparations: Two Accompanying Statements by Pauley; Actual Situation Awaits Adjustment by Implementing Agencies; Labor Compensation and Repeated Compensation Are Both Opposed

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] According to State Department sources today: The final report submitted by Edwin Pauley, the special envoy for investigating Japanese reparations, to President Truman is still under review by the White House. It is said that Pauley stated several points in the report: (1) The mission of the investigation was to determine the policy on Japanese reparations. In order to fulfill this mission, the investigation team focused only on collecting information on various broad categories of the Japanese economy and studying those most relevant to reparations. These property inventories and their records were either provided directly by the Japanese side or by MacArthur's headquarters. No review was added to the details, so once implemented, there will inevitably be some inconsistencies between the actual situation of comprehensive reparations and the detailed plans. This will be the responsibility of the reparations implementing agency to adjust. For example, deciding on the demilitarization of Japan and comprehensive reparations as principles, but without sufficient input to continue manufacturing goods for export, Japanese industry will not be able to operate. When deciding on reparations policies, arrangements can be made in advance, but it is difficult to pre-specify every detail. Regarding this level of detail, Japan must be ordered to report in detail in the future, and if there are any false reports or concealment, appropriate penalties should be imposed. (2) Pauley opposes labor compensation and repeated compensation. The countries demanding compensation already have a surplus of labor. If Japan sends out workers again, it will greatly affect the level of labor and living standards in Asian countries, which urgently need to be raised. As for repeated compensation, it is bound to first develop Japanese industry, fattening the hen, and then continuously taking eggs. In this way, after the compensation is paid off continuously, Japan can retain its surplus industry, convert it for military use, and compete in foreign markets, threatening the industrialization of neighboring countries. It is extremely dangerous to nurture future problems, and it is necessary to prevent them in advance.

### Japanese Land Reform Implemented Yesterday

One-Fifth of the Nation's Tenant Farmers Can Farm Their Own Land

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 21st] The Japanese Land Reform Law was implemented today. Land problem expert Yekinskit from MacArthur's headquarters made a statement, saying: The Japanese government submitted a farmland reform plan to the headquarters on March 15th of this year, but it was rejected due to the following shortcomings: (1) It was excessive for landlords to be allowed to retain five cho-bu (12.25 acres), which would leave 60% of the existing tenant farmers' land unaffected; (2) There were no countermeasures against excessively high rents; (3) The stipulated implementation period of five years was too long and unnecessary; (4) Entrusting the implementation of the reform to local officials would inevitably lead to bias in favor of landlords' interests and unfairness. However, the amended reform law has made great progress and is a far-reaching measure to alleviate the long-standing poverty and insecurity of Japanese farmers. Land ownership will see widespread distribution, and one-fifth of Japanese tenant farmers will be able to farm their own land. There are thorough measures to prevent illegal activities.

### India Strictly Enforces Tobacco Ban

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 20th Dispatch] The Indian government has decided to completely ban the smoking of opium in India. The exception is for those who are currently addicted to opium, who may continue to smoke it for the rest of their lives, provided they have a certificate from a examining doctor during this period. Some provinces that are absolutely prohibited from smoking opium are not affected by this decision. Seventy-five princely states in India have already or are in the process of absolutely prohibiting opium smoking within the state. According to the 1912 Hague Convention, the Indian government should implement a policy of prohibiting opium smoking.

### "Without Air Defense, There is No National Defense": Party, Government, and Military Leaders Gave Warning Speeches at Yesterday's Air Defense Festival Commemorative Meeting; Families of Fallen Airmen Speechless with Grief

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the 7th Air Defense Festival. At 9:00 AM, an air raid siren was sounded, and at the same time, the Air Defense Festival Commemorative Meeting was held at the Great Light Grand Theater, with Guo Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Cao Jun, Gu Chunfan, Zhu Ping, Li Ximou, Xu Caicheng, Wang Shenshan, and others as the presidium. More than a thousand people attended, including family members of air defense personnel, family members of fallen compatriots, representatives from various agencies, and guests. Mayor Wu, as chairman, briefly stated: Holding the Air Defense Festival here today, I feel deeply moved. Recalling my time in Chongqing, witnessing the fierce bombing by enemy planes, I felt extremely angry and deeply realized that to defend our territory, we must have a strong air force. After this long war of attrition, the motherland's vitality has not yet recovered, and expanding the air force cannot be achieved overnight, so we should at least prepare for passive air defense. Shanghai is located on the coast and has a dense population. If an air raid occurs, the consequences would be disastrous. For the sake of preparedness, future buildings in this city must be coordinated with air defense facilities, such as building underground tunnels. Therefore, at this time and in this place, commemorating the Air Defense Festival should especially remind citizens of the saying "Think of danger in times of safety" and "Preparedness ensures no calamity." We must strengthen our attention and vigilance towards air defense. Fang Zhi then delivered a speech, briefly stating: In modern times, with the development of science and technology in various countries, the international distance is becoming shorter and shorter. During our country's eight years of resistance against Japan, we suffered heavy losses from enemy air raids, and we began to realize the importance of air defense. "Without air defense, there is no national defense." Although the war has ended, we must pay attention to air defense for self-defense. Wu Zhi then delivered a speech, saying that after World War I, the air force has been fully utilized and has made great strides. The power of the bombing of Iwo Jima and Nagasaki is proof of this. Therefore, to talk about national defense, we must first talk about air defense. Before the invaders are eradicated, no one can guarantee that there will be no war in the world, so strengthening air defense is extremely urgent. Finally, Wang Weimin, commander of the Air Force Supply Department, made three points: (1) Citizens must receive air defense training; (2) They must have sufficient knowledge of the use of air defense tools; (3) Citizens must receive organizational training, and the air defense organization must be strict. The meeting ended at about 11:00 AM with music.

In addition, Ms. Zhang Ruizhi, a family member of an air force martyr, requested to express her opinions at the closing of the meeting, but she was unable to do so due to being overwhelmed with emotion. After the meeting, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and others hosted a tea party for the 24 families of air force martyrs who died in Shanghai during the war. Family members of air force martyrs raised the following points: (1) Children's education expenses; (2) Housing issues; (3) Living expenses; (4) The remains of the martyrs cannot be transported back to their hometowns. Mayor Wu promised to convene relevant agencies to discuss these issues and report them to the Air Force Headquarters for condolence. The relief items collected from all parties for the meeting are currently being collected by the local association. Once collected, they will be sent directly to the families of the fallen martyrs. In addition, in order to promote aviation and national construction and increase people's aviation knowledge, the Air Force Supply Command has placed a 100 kg bomb in each of the four locations: the Bund, the Great World, Cade Road, and in front of Jing'an Temple for citizens to visit. At 9:30 AM, the Aviation Commission also sent planes to scatter air defense leaflets in the city.

### American Businessmen's Feelings About the New Trade Regulations: Whether It Will Be Effective Depends on Whether the Methods Can Be Followed; Hope to Support Exporters

[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently interviewed an authoritative American exporter in this city to ask for his views on the recently promulgated revised trade regulations. He said: In principle, the regulations are very sound, especially in the point of economizing on China's foreign exchange, which is particularly necessary. However, whether the regulations can be effectively implemented depends on whether everyone can abide by the regulations. If the regulations can be implemented in an impartial spirit, they will definitely be a stabilizing factor for China's economy. Let's take a few examples to illustrate this. In the past, legitimate importing firms operated their businesses steadily. However, speculators, enjoying the same import rights, sold all kinds of imported goods at high prices. This was most evident in goods such as automobiles and milk powder. Legitimate importing firms, although subject to allocation quotas, maintained the lowest possible prices for various imported goods in order to maintain their current minimum operating expenses. However, the prices set by speculators were often three or four times the reasonable sales price. If the revised trade regulations cannot limit the allocation of imported goods to stable importing firms, then similar situations will continue to occur.

However, the new regulations seem to have completely forgotten about exporters. China should encourage exports at present. Exporters are currently unable to profit from export businesses due to high domestic costs. The government should especially plan to assist stable exporters. The foreign exchange earned by exporters must be converted to the government at the official rate, and the actual return for each US dollar converted is only 75 cents. However, the purchasing power of legal tender in this city is purely based on its black market price. Therefore, the difference between the black market and the official exchange rate invisibly causes exporters to lose 25% of the value of their conversions. This loss is bound to be borne by overseas buyers, which increases the cost of exports invisibly. How can they make a profit if they want to be profitable? Currently, most exporters in this city have fallen into a state of semi-shutdown, and staff has been reduced to the minimum number. Some stable exporters have even completely ceased operations. If the authorities allow stable exporters to import goods of equal value to the foreign exchange they convert to designated banks, it would be of great help. This move would have two important meanings: (1) Exporters can still maintain their business from import income; (2) In some cases, even though exporters' export businesses are losing money, they are still willing to continue operating in the hope of offsetting this export loss with the profits earned from imports.

### The Case of Demolishing Houses Protruding into Main Roads: The Public Works Bureau Plans to Come up with Alternative Solutions

The Public Works Committee of the former Municipal Senate suggested to the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau to demolish the houses next to bottleneck roads in the central district to facilitate traffic. It has been more than a month, but the Public Works Bureau has been reluctant to act rashly, considering that although this move would benefit pedestrians, it would cause great damage to the homeowners. In the current situation where everything is waiting to be rebuilt, there should be detailed consideration. It is understood that the bureau still intends to do so because it was assigned by the Senate, in order not to violate the will of the public opinion organ. However, it is now planned that for buildings next to bottleneck roads that are more than 20 years old, a portion will be demolished and a portion will be retained. Residents or businesses can demolish the protruding portion. If the new house was built within 20 years, or if there is no remaining space to live in after demolition, it will be temporarily retained. The suggestion will be sent to the Public Works Committee of the Senate for approval before implementation.

### The U.S. Side Begins to Take Back Blood Plasma, Nearly 40,000 Units Stored in 19 Warehouses, Will Still Use Pharmaceuticals to Compensate Lida Trading Company

[Our Newspaper] After the blood plasma problem was satisfactorily resolved the day before yesterday, the inventory stored in the various warehouses of Lida International Trading Company began to be taken back by the U.S. side yesterday afternoon. The reporter drove to Ruifeng Warehouse on Tianzhutang Street at about 1:00 PM and saw more than 20 U.S. Navy personnel and several giant trucks parked in the open space inside the fence. Soon, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson of the U.S. Surplus Property Disposal Committee, Schmidt from the Public Information Group, and representatives from the U.S. Consulate General, the U.S. Navy, and the person in charge of Lida Trading Company arrived one after another. The blood plasma was stored in the fourth-floor warehouse, and eight laborers hired by the company moved it downstairs, and then the U.S. Navy loaded it onto trucks. The blood plasma packaging is a rectangular cardboard box, measuring 2.6 cubic feet, weighing 73 pounds, with the words "Normal Human Plasma, 12 Dried Packages" printed on the box.

There are a total of 218 boxes in this warehouse, each box containing 12 packages of 500cc units, totaling more than 2,600 units. All of them were signed for receipt by Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, loaded onto trucks, and driven to the naval warehouse for storage. Then they continued to extract from other warehouses of Lida Trading Company.

According to the person in charge of Lida Trading Company, there are a total of more than 39,000 units of blood plasma stored in 19 warehouses. Therefore, the U.S. side may not be able to clear all of them in half a day yesterday. As for the physical objects used as payment, they are mostly pharmaceuticals, which the company will choose after the U.S. side provides a list of items.

At the same time, the committee has informed the U.S. Navy and the Consulate General of this matter, and the U.S. Consulate General has informed the Chinese authorities, and the national authorities are now taking appropriate action."

### A Madman Playing with Fire Burns Himself to Death; Three Fires in Pudong and the South City

[Our Newspaper] At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Yang Gengsheng, a resident of No. 36 Tiedianqiao, near Qichangzhan in Pudong, who was suffering from madness, caused a fire by playing with a kerosene lamp, which ignited the house. The fire was fierce for two hours. Later, the Pudong Fire Department drove to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was extinguished at 4:00 AM. It is estimated that the roof was burned into charcoal, and the hands and feet have been reduced to ashes.

The Danda Printing Company at No. 15 Hongyefang, Lujiabang Road, in the South City, overturned its kerosene stove at about 5:45 PM yesterday, causing smoke to penetrate the roof, which spread to the floor of No. 18 next door.

### Insurance Policies with Stamp Tax Duplication, Insurance Industry Asks for Amendment, Ministry of Finance Agrees to Consider; Luo Beichen Talks After Going to Nanjing for Instructions

[Our Newspaper] Luo Beichen, chairman of the National Federation of Insurance Commerce, recently went to Nanjing to consult the Direct Taxation Department and the Counselor's Office of the Ministry of Finance on the issue of affixing stamps to insurance policies. He told reporters: "The current issue of affixing stamps to insurance policies is mainly one of tax duplication. As far as insurance policies are concerned, the proportional taxation of insurance policies and contracts in our country is a duplication. We are now requesting that insurance policies be affixed with stamps according to ordinary contracts, while insurance premium receipts be affixed with stamps according to the proportional taxation method, to show fairness. Secondly, as far as reinsurance documents are concerned, the original insurer has already affixed the full amount of stamps, and if reinsurance documents are affixed with stamps again, it would be even more of a duplication. In addition, for term insurance, stamps should be calculated and affixed on a daily basis. For non-fixed-term transportation insurance policies, stamps should be affixed for a period of 15 days (because according to the average estimate of the insurance industry, the date consumed by various transportation lines in China is mostly within 15 days), but usually they are affixed for a full year, so the premium income for insurance businesses with short terms is often insufficient to cover the cost of affixing stamps. If the above points can be improved, there will be no loss to the government's tax revenue, and for the insurance industry, it will remove a 'heavy burden.' It is heard that the authorities of the Ministry of Finance believe that there is considerable reason for the points raised by Luo and have agreed to consider making amendments."

### Legal Interpretation Regarding UNRRA Personnel's Smuggling and Tax Evasion Case

[Our Newspaper] At the beginning of this month, UNRRA personnel Kaiyi brought a large number of goods on a ship from the Philippines to Shanghai in an attempt to smuggle and evade taxes and was detained by the police bureau and handed over to the district prosecutor's office. However, the district court, in view of the fact that the basic agreement signed between our country and UNRRA stated that "UNRRA personnel, when performing official duties, are exempt from any form of legal summons for actions within the scope of their duties," and that on October 17th of this year, the Shanghai District Court ruled against the acceptance of a case against Hayes, the general manager of UNRRA's Zhenru Machinery Factory, for allegedly excavating and occupying a burial site, based on the agreement, the district court consulted the Ministry of Justice on whether to accept the Kaiyi smuggling and tax evasion case. Yesterday, the Ministry of Justice's interpretation order arrived, giving two points of instruction regarding this case: (1) UNRRA personnel's crimes, except for actions related to their duties, cannot enjoy extraterritoriality; (2) The Provisional Regulations on Punishing Smuggling and Evasion of Customs Duties promulgated by the National Government on July 4th of the 25th year of the Republic of China are no longer applicable, and smuggling and tax evasion should be handled in accordance with the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations. If the case meets the provisions of Articles 1 and 3, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, the court may still accept it.

### Xin Nianyang Specialize in Stealing Mailbags and Letters; Impersonating to Commit Fraud

[Report from our newspaper] Huang Yinsheng (33 years old, from Suzhou, residing at 505 Henan Middle Road) and his friend Zhong Shusheng (27 years old, residing at 102, Lane 759, Tiantong Road), along with Huang's apprentice Jin Shuren (age and origin unknown), colluded to commit fraud. Huang specialized in stealing letters from mailbags when postmen parked their vehicles. He then approached Tan Yulin of the Hualian Cigarette Shop at 1224 Zhongzheng East Road, using the content of the letters to concoct counterfeit medicine, which Zhong Shusheng and Jin Shuren delivered, defrauding him of 150,000 legal tender. The second victim was Fan Wentian, 45 years old, from Tianjin, residing at 85 Lianyungang Road, who was also defrauded of 94,000 yuan on September 20th using letters. The third victim was Li Rongzi (female), 42 years old, residing at 8, Lane 5, Fanshili, Muming Road, who was defrauded of 96,000 yuan. The fourth victim was Jiang Dingyuan, residing at 24, Lane 505, Chengdu Road, who was defrauded of 96,000 yuan. The total amount defrauded in the four incidents was 496,000 legal tender. At 10 PM on the 14th, Huang attempted the same trick again, stealing letters from a mailbag placed by a postman next to the Qingxuguan wall at 721 Zhongzheng East Road. This was witnessed by a volunteer policeman No. 1925, who apprehended him and took him to the Postal Bureau on Carter Road. Inspector Xu Zuiyi, Lin Decheng, and the victim postman No. 726 sent him to the Xincheng Branch for interrogation, where he confessed the above. The police then dispatched staff members Weng Yongquan and Pan Zhipeng to arrest his accomplices Zhong Shusheng and Jin Shuren. They confessed to helping out, claiming they only received 40,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan respectively. After preliminary examination, the facts were confirmed, and they will be transferred to the judicial authorities for trial in the coming days.

### Talking about Fire Prevention in the Fire Season; Shanghai's Equipment is Nationally Ranked First; Day and Night Alertness and Swift Action; Full Departure Within Half a Minute

[Report from our newspaper] Fire, this mysterious thing, is the driving force of all power. Without it, from personal daily life to the industrial construction of a country, everything would become impossible. Since the ancient times when Suiren discovered "fire," it has brought immeasurable benefits and help to people, but the disasters of fire have also followed. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Do not underestimate that single spark; it can destroy a family, a village, a city. It can turn billions of dollars of property into ashes in an instant, and it can make tens of thousands of people homeless.

People living in cities see robbery and kidnapping cases in the newspapers every day, only knowing that a certain family has been robbed of so many jewels and property, or that someone has spent hundreds of thousands of US dollars on ransom, and think that the amount of loss is considerable, but they know that the loss from fire is truly terrifying! According to the statistics of the authorities, from the time of receiving the property last year to the present, the losses from various criminal cases, including theft, kidnapping, robbery, and various crimes, amounted to more than 2 billion yuan, while the losses from fire alarms amounted to more than 3 billion yuan, exceeding it by about one-third!

Furthermore, robbery and theft mean that the materials still exist, but fire will destroy the materials. Usually, we only know that the police protect our lives and property, but we do not know that the fire brigade occupies an even more important position, because only it can "eliminate" and "prevent" fire, greatly reducing the power of fire.

The world's first fire brigade was in London, the capital of England. As early as the beginning of the 19th century, several insurance companies, in order to prevent fire damage to customers who had purchased fire insurance, established a small fire-fighting organization within the company. This was the beginning of the fire brigade. Later, after the Great Fire of London, the municipal authorities, fearing the lessons of the past, formed a fire brigade with public funds. At this time, countries around the world, seeing the importance of the fire brigade, formed them one after another.

The first fire brigade in our country began with the Beijing Police Department, and later other places also established them one after another. However, limited by technology and funding, compared with foreign fire-fighting organizations, it was like a newborn baby. The more comprehensive one is the fire brigade of the current Shanghai Police Bureau, which is second to none in China and is a model for the whole country. In order to understand the detailed organizational situation, the reporter made a visit to Section Chief Ye of the Second Section of the brigade.

Fire Control Room

There are a total of seven fire brigades in Shanghai, and the one at the intersection of Henan Road is the most comprehensive. After any fire alarm occurs in this city, it is immediately transferred to the fire control room, which is located on the second floor of the Municipal Government Building, where two people work day and night. Every minute, every second, they sit in front of the phone number 15183, ready to serve people at any time. Their only hope is that when the unfortunate people frantically ask the fire brigade for help, they hope that they can maintain the last bit of calm and must report the name of the street where the fire occurred, as well as the intersection and house number in detail. If the fire location is in an apartment, it is even more necessary to report the floor and room number clearly. The most ideal thing is to report the type of building, such as a building, bungalow, store, or factory. This is of great help to the work of the fire brigade, such as the allocation of fire trucks. It can directly help the fire scene to be rescued early.

Always Ready to Go

The life of a firefighter, in the eyes of ordinary people, is undoubtedly extraordinarily tense. They spend all day in the fire brigade, always ready to go. As long as the alarm rings, they can all be dispatched within 30 seconds. If the fire alarm is in the middle of the night, they will immediately jump out of bed, step out of the window, and slide down the copper pole to the floor below. Because their dormitory is upstairs, in order to save the time of walking up the stairs, each window has a copper pole, and every well-trained firefighter can rely on this to go up and down freely. The firefighters' clothes are all placed on the fire truck, so they all put on their clothes after getting into the truck.

Mostly Due to Negligence

Fire is certainly terrible, but it can be prevented. Because most fires are caused by people's negligence. To prevent fires, you must first know how fires occur.

The biggest causes of fire are nothing more than the following three categories: (1) Human error: due to laziness and neglect, people do not pay attention or be careful on weekdays. (2) Human intent - deliberate fraud and revenge, spies, etc., deliberately arson. (3) Spontaneous combustion - due to the sunlight during the day, the friction of machines, lightning, and other factors, flammable materials ignite spontaneously.

Except for categories (2) and (3), most fires are due to people's negligence.

Winter is the "fire season." After the beginning of winter, the weather gradually becomes cold, the climate becomes dry, and the wind will be stronger. Every household lights a fire to keep warm, and the chance of fire is even greater. But let the reporter repeat again, "fire" can be prevented, as long as you are careful and cautious on weekdays!

### Yu Qiaqing's Coffin Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow; Grand Funeral to be Held the Day After Tomorrow Morning

[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure from Zhenhai living in Shanghai and the owner of the Sanbei Shipping Company, passed away in the wartime capital during the War of Resistance. His coffin is now being transported back to Shanghai. The company dispatched the Ruitai ship to Yichang to transport it. The ship carrying the coffin departed from Yichang on the 6th. After arriving in Wuhan, it was publicly mourned by various groups and a funeral was held. It departed from Wuhan on the 14th. Public mourning ceremonies were held in Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, and other places. It is learned that the coffin-transporting ship passed Zhenjiang and headed east at 1 PM yesterday, anchored in Jiangyin last night, and set sail for Shanghai this morning. It is expected to arrive at Wusongkou around the evening, anchored at Songkou overnight, and will enter the port tomorrow morning (the 23rd). It is estimated that it will dock at Pier 13 at 2 PM tomorrow (the 23rd). All levels of staff of Sanbei Company will go to the pier to greet it at that time, and a public mourning ceremony will be held on the ship that night. The coffin will remain on the ship for another night, and the funeral will be held at 8 AM on the 24th. At 2 PM, ten groups will hold a public mourning ceremony and a memorial service. According to news from the preparatory office, more than a thousand pieces of elegiac couplets, scrolls, and banners have been received from all walks of life. During the funeral, various groups will donate ceremonial guards. The route of the funeral procession has been slightly changed because the Ningbo Fellow Association has prepared a grand roadside memorial ceremony. The coffin will be carried ashore from the ship at 8 AM, passing Nanjing Road westward, to Lloyd Road northward, Zhifu Road westward, Xizang Road southward, passing the Fellow Association all the way south, to the intersection of Xizang South Road and Linsen East Road, turning into Minguo Road to the Siming Guildhall. A colorful memorial arch has been set up at Pier 13 on the Bund yesterday to welcome the coffin.

### Old Man Qiaqing's Life

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Yu Qiaqing's coffin is being transported from the wartime capital to Shanghai and will enter the port tomorrow.

Almost everyone in Shanghai knows about this famous figure of the sea. In Yu Qiaqing's later years, people generally respectfully called him "Old Man Qiaqing," while some who liked to joke behind his back still called him "Brother A'de." However, the title of "Brother A'de" did not contain any disrespect. On the contrary, it seemed to have a more intimate meaning. In fact, Yu Qiaqing's career was indeed very admirable.

Yu Qiaqing was originally from Longshan Township, Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province. Because Longshan is north of the three counties of Zhenhai, Cixi, and Yuyao, it is also known as Sanbei. Like many famous people, he also came from a poor background. At the age of fifteen, he went to Shanghai to work as an apprentice in a paint shop. This paint shop, since Mr. Yu entered the door, actually became more and more prosperous, earning a lot of profits. Later, others wore them and made up the story, and a myth was widely circulated.

Barefoot God of Wealth Starts as an Apprentice

It is said that the boss of the paint shop dreamed of a barefoot god of wealth sending in gold ingots the night before Yu Qiaqing entered the shop. The next day, when Mr. Yu entered the shop, it happened to be raining heavily. He was afraid that his shoes would get wet, so he took them off and held them in his hands, entering the door barefoot, but accidentally fell upside down. However, the shop owner not only did not blame him but thought it was a dream omen coming true, and the "living gold ingot" entered the door, so he gave him great preferential treatment, and Mr. Yu has been rising step by step and making a fortune ever since.

In fact, the factors of Mr. Yu's success were probably still in his diligence and eagerness to learn. At that time, he was an apprentice on the one hand and went to night school to study English on the other hand, so from the age of twenty-six, he left the paint shop and successively served as compradors in several foreign banks, gradually laying an economic foundation.

Although he was a comprador, he was not like the general comprador class, who only knew how to fawn on foreigners and exploit his compatriots. He was enthusiastic, insightful, and had nationalistic ideas. At that time, several sensational incidents occurred in Shanghai that caused disputes with foreigners, and Yu Qiaqing used great efforts to win back a lot of honor and rights for the Chinese people.

Strive to Win Rights and Interests from Foreigners

The first incident was in the 24th year of Guangxu, when the French sent troops to invade the cemetery of the Ningbo Guildhall, which aroused the anger of the people of Ningbo in the whole city and caused a strike that lasted for half a year. Later, thanks to the efforts of Yu Qiaqing and others, the French Concession Council gave up its original intention.

In the 31st year of Guangxu, 1904 in the Gregorian calendar, a so-called "big disturbance in the court" occurred in Shanghai. The cause was a dispute between Jin Gongbo, the presiding judge of the Mixed Court, and Mr. Twyman, the British vice-consul, over the detention of a female suspect in human trafficking. At that time, Jin Gongbo ruled that she should be temporarily detained in the women's prison, while Mr. Twyman insisted that she be imprisoned in the western prison. The western policeman on duty not only refused to obey Jin's ruling but also closed the gate of the court and held a club, intending to attack Jin. The people in the audience were very dissatisfied, and the news spread, and all walks of life felt injustice, which led to a strike. Some ignorant people were even so angry that they surrounded and burned the police station. Therefore, the concession authorities made a large number of arrests, and all the policemen in the world went on strike, and the chaotic situation was unprecedented. At that time, the Qing officials had no results in negotiations, so they only asked four gentry and merchants to come out to mediate, and Yu Qiaqing was one of them. However, the other three soon gave up halfway because of difficulties, and only Mr. Yu still persisted in arguing and negotiating with the Public Works Department in a non-arrogant and humble manner. Finally, the British side was forced to submit, fulfilling the conditions of removing Mr. Twyman from the post of juror, apologizing to the Chinese government, revoking the punishment of the policeman who insulted the Chinese official, and releasing the arrested civilians. Then Yu Qiaqing, together with the Daotai at that time and the presiding judge of the Mixed Court, went door to door along Nanjing Road to persuade the shops to open, and at the same time, Chinese and Western policemen resumed their posts, and a storm finally subsided.

In addition, he initiated the Chinese Merchants' Association to strive for Chinese municipal power and ran the Chinese Merchants' Gymnastics Association to strive for Chinese self-defense power. The former later obtained the quota of Chinese directors of the Public Works Department, while the latter established the Chinese team of the later International Volunteer Corps.

Indispensable Contribution to the Success of the Northern Expedition

Yu Qiaqing also made an indispensable contribution to the success of the Northern Expedition. At that time, when the revolutionary army advanced into Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Mr. Yu provided huge sums of money to support them and organized a goods exchange with the party members, making a great contribution economically.

His personal career was also thriving. The Siming Bank and the Ningbo and Shaoxing Steam Navigation Company, although under the pressure of foreign forces, finally relied on his perseverance and painstaking management, and their scale gradually took shape. Later, he established the Sanbei Company with his own funds and actively developed the shipping industry. He himself served as the president and chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Local Association, and was the de facto authority in Shanghai's financial and shipping circles.

In the mid-term of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yu Qiaqing left Shanghai for the mainland. At that time, there were many unfavorable rumors about him in the society. No one dared to say for sure what the truth of this matter was. However, no matter what, Mr. Yu, as an old man in his seventies, was able to continue to engage in commercial activities in the mountainous mainland and contribute to the government's circulation of materials. This kind of spirit is still moving, so when his remains were transported back to Shanghai, we still felt infinite mourning.

### Wang Zhuchen Embezzles Enemy Property: District Attorney's Office Files Public Prosecution; Defendant's Statements Untrue and Unreliable

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Wang Guichen's suspected embezzlement of enemy assets, namely the German company Wuyang Firm's automobile materials, has been under investigation by the District Attorney's Office since it was transferred by the Investigation Team for over two months. The investigation has now concluded, and a public prosecution has been filed. The original indictment is as follows: Wang Zhuchen, male, 28 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at No. 122 Shuntian Village, Chengdu Road, currently in custody. The defendant was originally a mechanical engineer in our country's air force, holding the rank of colonel and serving as factory director in air transport. In the winter of the year before the victory, he came to Shanghai under the pretense of attending his father's funeral and has resided here ever since. Initially, he made a living repairing and selling old bicycles at home. Later, he partnered with Qian Ziqiu, Zhu Qingyun, and others to establish the Fuzhong Company on Chuangong Road, specializing in automobile business (after the victory). They set up an office on Broadway Road No. 25. Later, the business was taken over by the defendant alone. After that, Yan Huiyuan, a classmate of the defendant from Germany, returned to China, and he and Yan and her husband, Yu Wei, jointly established the Xinyou Company. Through Yu's introduction, he met Li Jilan, the former Songhu

Garrison Commander. The Xinyou Company then moved to No. 2 Beihaining Road, the former Nagashima Firm, and voluntarily became a contracted automobile repair shop for the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. They repaired vehicles for the headquarters without charging labor fees, while materials were either provided by the headquarters or purchased on their behalf (see item 3 of the contract). The repair of vehicles was based on notifications from the Transportation Department of the headquarters (see item 5 of the contract). The No. 2 Beihaining Road factory originally contained materials left by Nagashima (detailed in the Nagashima Received Materials Inventory). Starting from August 1st of last year, it was reported that the materials were

moved without authorization. A portion was consigned for sale to the Russian Roseublum Automobile Company, and a portion was stored at the Central Machine Factory on Wuding Road. Wu Tianxiang secretly reported this to the Investigation Team for Handling Enemy and Puppet Assets, and the case was transferred for investigation. During questioning, the defendant admitted to moving the materials but claimed that the reported quantity was incorrect. He also claimed that the old cars and spare parts left over after repairs were the price paid by the garrison headquarters for

free repairs. Therefore, the materials he moved were his to dispose of freely. He also stated that their only evidence was the contract with the garrison headquarters. Therefore, whether the defendant is suspected of embezzlement depends on whether the ownership of the materials belonged to the defendant. Evidence No. 12, submitted by the defendant, is the seven-point contract, not a contract signed by both parties. There is no approval document for the submitted application for implementing the contract that can be used as reference. Evidence Nos. 4 to 8, except for No. 6, which mentions "inspecting old

automobile parts and estimating repair work," none of them indicate that the remaining materials after repairing the old cars of the garrison headquarters were allocated to the defendant. The defendant's side has no clear records or calculations of how much material was used to repair the 20 vehicles of the headquarters, how much material was received when moving into the Haining Road

house, and how many old cars were allocated by the headquarters. After sending a letter to the garrison headquarters to check the records, it was found that apart from using the Haining Road house as a contracted military automobile factory, the rest

had no record. The witness Yu Enbiao, presented by the defendant, testified in court that he was only a classmate of the defendant and knew nothing about the Nagashima matter, so he could not provide any support. Li Jinbiao, the director of the transportation department of the garrison headquarters, provided a written testimony, stating that the garrison headquarters had sent a Ford sedan (No. 15042), a small Ford sedan, and a Chrysler sedan to the factory for repair. The Chrysler sedan was approved for return to the owner, Su Chailin, and the repair fee of

over two million yuan had been paid in full. It is unlikely that such a small number of vehicles would warrant a large amount (five truckloads) of material as payment. Therefore, the defendant's statement is untrue and unreliable. He is suspected of the crime of embezzlement under Article 315, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. (As for Liu Zhongli's accusation against Ying Han, Yu Qingjian, and others regarding Wang Zhuchen's embezzlement of enemy assets, it is already on file as Case No. 4201, Series A, Investigation, Year 35, and should not be discussed in this case.) Therefore, in accordance with Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed. Prosecutor Yu Xin.

### Wu Yiming and Zhang Yichang Each Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court yesterday announced the verdicts in two cases of suspected collaborators: (1) Wu Yiming, secretary of the puppet Suzhou Maintenance Committee, sentenced to five years of imprisonment. (2) Zhang Yichang, intelligence agent for the enemy naval intelligence agency in Manila, sentenced to three years of imprisonment.

### Yan Qingxiang Appears in Court Ailing, Sighs and Wipes Away Tears

The case of Yan Qingxiang, general manager of the Suzhou Su Yarn Factory, being suspected of being a traitor, was previously investigated by the High Court multiple times. It was originally scheduled to be concluded by a collegiate panel yesterday morning, but because he was coughing up blood in prison and could not speak much, it was temporarily changed to an investigation hearing, and only Tang Shoumin, chairman of the puppet Commercial Control Association, and Ge Liangchou, chairman of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce, were brought to court to inquire about the puppet Cotton Control Committee. Yan was

carried from prison to the courtroom on a wooden-framed canvas reclining chair, wearing a blue cloth robe covered with a blanket, a black velvet hat, and a gray

scarf around his neck. His eyes were dull, his face

yellow, and he sighed softly from time to time, wiping away tears with a towel. A forensic doctor accompanied

him to court and reported his condition to the presiding judge, stating: Yan Qingxiang suffers from lung disease, with blood in his sputum. He coughed up blood in prison on October 31st, and the bleeding stopped on November 10th. But afterwards, the coughing up of blood has intensified and has not stopped until now, and the temperature is quite high. It is feared that speaking too much will cause him to cough up blood again, so please postpone the questioning. The forensic doctor also brought a

jar containing sputum and blood. After a short wait, Yan was carried back to prison.

### Not a Single Female Star Summoned: Disappointed Spectators; Xu Xinfu, Liu Zhonghao, and Shi Tingpan Released on Bail Separately; Li Lihua and Others Not in Shanghai, Submit Applications for Postponement

[Our Newspaper's Report] Of the second batch of suspected collaborators in the film and theater industry summoned by the Investigation Division of the Municipal High Court, only director Xu Xinfu, Jin Du Theater Manager Liu Zhonghao, and Hu Guang Theater Manager Shi Tingpan reported yesterday. Many people went to the court hoping to catch a glimpse of the stars, but because not a single female star appeared, their efforts were in vain. Shi reported first at 9:10 a.m., and soon after, Xu and Liu arrived together. They sat inside the bailiff's room chatting. Zheng Ping, Mei Xi's wife, brought the subpoena to the court on behalf of Mei, who is not in Shanghai. The bailiff told her that criminal cases cannot be represented and that she should submit a written application. Zheng hurried out and completed a written application, but because the application form and procedures were not in compliance, it was

returned, and she was instructed to submit it in the afternoon. Zhang Puhai also submitted a written statement due to illness, stating that he could not appear. Li Lihua, Bian Yuying, and others claimed that they were not in Shanghai and also submitted written applications for postponement. At 10:30 a.m., the prosecutor began the hearing in the courtroom on the sixth floor, first summoning Shi Tingpan for questioning. At 11:10 a.m., Liu Zhonghao was summoned, followed by Xu Xinfu. The questioning ended at 12:30 p.m., and they were released on bail separately, with instructions to appear when summoned.

### Change of Head of General Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)

[Our Newspaper's Report] Lan Chunchi, the head of the General Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), has requested to resign due to the embezzlement of public funds by Wu Suiren, the section chief of the disbursement section of the department, for private high-interest lending, feeling a deep sense of mismanagement.

### Underground Banks: Two Already Sealed; Several Provincial Banks Establish Offices; Procedures Not in Compliance

[Our Newspaper's Report] The crackdown on usury in the city is currently underway. The Social Affairs Bureau has now discovered that several out-of-town money houses have set up communication offices in the city without authorization and are lending money at high interest rates. The bureau has taken action based on the severity of the circumstances, and two of them have already been sealed. According to sources who spoke to reporters, those engaged in usury have a variety of tricks. Some operate under the guise of shops, while others have no name and operate with just a telephone in a room. As for interest rates, they are currently around two cents per dollar. Due to the current economic downturn, the number of bad debts is increasing, and the black market often adopts the method of lending against collateral. This time, the Ministry of Finance and the Social Affairs Bureau are determined to crack down on usury. The methods used are to strictly examine the accounts of the money lending industry and analyze them in detail to detect the activities of illegal lenders, and to encourage whistleblowing, because the existence of "underground money houses" is seriously detrimental to legitimate money lending businesses. It is hoped that legitimate businessmen will not hesitate to report them. The interbank lending rate among money houses is as high as 16.5%, which also contributes to the rise of black market usury. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau recently discovered that several provincial banks have established offices in the city to handle lending business, but the procedures are not in compliance. The offices are now separately requesting instructions from the provincial bank authorities.

### Ling Guangyan Retried for Opening Comfort Women Stations

Ling Guangyan graduated from Chizhi University in his early years and studied in France. Later, he went to Japan to study commercial law and married a Japanese woman. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the puppet organization and served in various military and political positions, including a puppet major general brigade commander, for as long as six years. He also opened the "Dafa Company" in Suzhou and established "Comfort Stations," as evidenced by a commemorative photo of the opening banquet on April 27, 1938. This photo was voluntarily sent to the High Court by people from other provinces. The photo shows Ling with the Pen Military Propaganda Team and dozens of enemy men and women, with the inscription "In the land of Suzhou's singing and dancing, a beautiful day dawns; cherry blossoms and plum blossoms bloom together, and the garden is a family." Later, Ling was sentenced to twelve years by the High Court, but the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. Yesterday afternoon, the witnesses were summoned for investigation, and the hearing was adjourned to another date.

### Three Giant Cranes to be Built on Qiuxin Wharf

[Our Newspaper's Report] The UNRRA Machine Factory is building three giant cranes on Qiuxin Wharf. One of them is the largest in the city, 150 feet long and 80 feet high, installed on a pontoon, and can lift 150,000 to 200,000 pounds at a time. The other two can also lift 40,000 to 50,000 pounds. These cranes are extremely large and can move heavy machinery such as generators and locomotives from ships to the wharf, requiring only a few workers to operate the machinery. In the future, the use of this machine to load and unload goods will be hundreds of times more efficient than in the past.

### Social Services: Reader Consultation

Legal Queries

(1) Misunderstanding of Lease Agreement

Guo Hanqing asks: In January of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), I leased a piece of land from someone named Jia for a term of ten years. During the war, without considering the original agreement, I subleased the land to someone named Yi, with the term ending at the end of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), exceeding the original lease term by eleven months. Disputes may inevitably arise in the future. May I ask: (1) Am I liable for the crime of embezzlement under Article 335 of the Criminal Law and the crime of fraud and breach of trust under Article 339? (2) If the original landlord extorts me with this as an excuse, how should I respond?

[Lawyer Zou Liankui's Answer] The responsibilities that a person should bear are divided into civil and criminal. Those who bear civil responsibility under civil law do not necessarily have criminal responsibility. The act of subletting leased land to others without considering the original agreement, if indeed the case, does not constitute crimes such as embezzlement, fraud, or breach of trust. (2) The solution is to ask the landlord to extend the lease term or to ask the sublessee to shorten the lease term. The terms and conditions must be negotiated.

(2) Return of Shares

Wu Yuanfu asks: In May of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), I invested 30,000 yuan (puppet currency) in a certain money house, amounting to 300 shares. The money house held a puppet license and was declared liquidated after the victory. Recently, I received a notice instructing me to go to a certain accounting firm to receive the return of my shares. The money house was valued at 10 million yuan, approved by the manager. There are legal issues in principle, and I pray for your answer: (1) When the money house was established, a shareholders' meeting was held to decide on all matters. Is it also necessary to hold a shareholders' meeting to approve matters during liquidation? (2) Is it legal for the money house to handle matters at a value of three? (3) The money house's manager asked to temporarily issue only small amounts, while keeping the integer number of shares under his name to maintain future development. (4) The money house's reputation is not an asset.

[Lawyer Qin Kui's Answer] (1) Commercial and financial institutions established with the approval of the enemy puppet regime are liquidated by order of the government and do not need to be dissolved by a resolution of the shareholders' meeting. (2) At the time of departure, if it is sold to others, and in fact can get more price, but intentionally give a lower price, it can be considered illegal. (3) How the corruption, need to be clear, if true, then it is illegal. (4) Commercial financial institutions established with the approval of the enemy, regardless of reputation, must be liquidated, if the enemy, then it is in the list of confiscation.

### Yarn Mills Get a Share: New Procedures for Yarn Allocation; Weaving Gets Priority, Followed by Replication Industry; Factories Share Profits with Customers and Export Sales

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Management Committee held a routine meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Wu, Vice Chairman Li, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, and Liu Citeng attended. After much discussion, it was resolved that cotton yarn produced by all state-owned and private yarn mills that also weave fabric should be given the highest priority for their own use. Next is the replication industry associations. The remaining quota will be split, half for the factories to transport to other provinces. The remaining half will be divided into two parts. One part will be allocated by the yarn mills to their old customers, and the other part will be allocated to the members of the Yarn Merchants Association. It is reported that the Textile Construction Company will decide today to allocate the remaining 2,000 bales of yarn at a price to yarn merchants, retailers, and some distributors.

The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association also held a general meeting of members at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, which lasted until about 7:00 p.m. During the meeting, the members discussed the fourth round of yarn allocation in detail and resolved that after deducting 24,000 bales of cotton yarn used by the factories for their own weaving from the total amount of yarn allocated to state-owned and private factories in the fourth round, the remaining yarn that can be allocated is 51,250 bales. Of these, 24,000 bales will be allocated to the Replication Association, 2,000 bales will be used for the South Transport by Gu Factories, and 1,500 bales will be supplied to retailers. The remaining 23,750 bales will be divided equally into two parts, each with 11,875 bales. Half of the yarn will be freely transported and sold by the factories to other provinces, and the remaining half will be divided into two parts, each with 5,937.5 bales. Half of the yarn will be allocated by the private factories to their old customers, and the remaining half, according to the decision of the Textile Management Committee, should be allocated to the members of the Yarn Merchants Association. However, yarn factory colleagues believe that it should be freely disposed of by the factories, or transported to other provinces, or allocated to the Yarn Merchants Association, to show that yarn factories still have autonomy in their operations and to benefit production and sales. It has now been decided that the Textile Association will send a letter to the Textile Management Committee to request approval.

### Price Limits for Cotton Cloth Agreed Upon: Fine Cloth at 88,000, Fine Material at 85,000

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee held its fourth meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau Conference Room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.

Director Gu reported on the minutes of the previous meeting, and then Dong Jiufeng reported on the recent market price of cotton (omitted). Then, the various costs compiled by the dyeing and weaving industry were discussed, amended and passed by the previous meeting, and verified by the Social Affairs Bureau, and it should be decided. After detailed discussion, it was unanimously decided that the cost price, 12 pounds of fine cloth is 88,000 yuan, 12 pounds of fine twill is 85,000 yuan, 191 mercerized cotton is 145,000 yuan, and serge is 105,000 yuan. Then, Dong Jiufeng stated that the cotton cloth market price should be calculated by adding a 12% profit to the factory price, which has been approved by the Textile Management Committee. It will be implemented as filed. Finally, Pan Shihao of the dyeing and weaving industry explained the recent yarn allocation situation, hoping that the quantity and quality of yarn allocation will increase to eliminate the black market. Finally, it was decided that the factory price will be submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation.

### Dull Bond Market

The transaction volume was 5 million yuan.

### Tight Coal Market

The coal market for bituminous coal is experiencing a serious shortage due to the arrival of winter in the production areas and low production. Black market prices are soaring. This news has reached Shanghai. Although the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee is still trying to maintain stability, the supply is difficult due to the small amount of incoming goods. Factories and households are rushing to buy, causing the market to become even tighter, especially for bituminous coal. Prices are rising rapidly.

Coal Briquette Industry to Receive Raw Materials on the 25th

The Fuel Management Committee has decided to allocate raw material coal for the third phase of this month to the city's mechanized coal briquette industry starting from the 25th. The application for coal allocation for this month by various factories ended yesterday. The need for coal next month will be handled by representatives from various associations starting yesterday, and will not be resolved individually.

Regarding the shipment of Vietnamese coal to China, the Fuel Management Committee is currently continuing to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities. It is said that the Vietnamese side needs to conduct the transaction in the form of material exchange, so the progress is somewhat slow, and it is feared that it will not be possible to come to China within the year.

### Continuous Arrivals: Rice Prices Continue to Weaken

The rice market is experiencing a surge in arrivals, with a total of over 16,000 stones arriving in both the northern and southern markets. The market sentiment has become sluggish. Southern japonica rice continued to fall by over 2,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also fell by a small amount of over 1,000 yuan. High-quality indica rice remains stable, but with a slight softening, while Du indica rice has also fallen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There are very few transactions. Baiyuan has dropped by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and Yinyuan has dropped by 2,000 yuan. Flour sales are lacking and the factory supply is limited. It is difficult for the market to improve. Miscellaneous brands of flour are gradually declining, falling by another small amount of 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat is flat. Red beans are not being consumed much, and have returned by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. The future form is still shifted by exports. Soybean transactions are few. Soybean cakes are flat and positive. Peanuts are offered up to over three thousand loads, going to the Nanyang banana trees as fertilizer. The oil market for raw oil is short of product and firm. The soybean oil market price is flat, but the sesame oil supply is greater than demand, with few major trades, dropping wildly by three to five thousand yuan.

### Yarn Market Stagnation: Confiscation of Discovered Black Market Transactions; Too Much Coarse Yarn in the Fourth Allocation

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the yarn market remained extremely quiet. The number of attendees was small, and they were mostly chatting with each other, with no transactions to be discussed. It seemed they were waiting for the allocation from various factories. There was a notice from Mayor Wu in the market, stating that to encourage the reporting of black market transactions, once verified, the goods would be confiscated, and half of the proceeds would be awarded to the informant. As a result, off-market transactions have become even rarer, and various yarn shops are virtually out of business. The Cotton Yarn Reproduction Industry Yarn Allocation Committee's fourth cotton yarn allocation for the third period was finalized yesterday. The allocated yarn quantity will still be provided by the Textile Construction and the six district cotton textile associations, totaling 5,535 bales, similar to previous allocations. However, there is still an excess of coarse yarn and a shortage of fine yarn. Due to repeated excess allocations of 10-count coarse yarn, the Reproduction Committee has requested the Textile Management Committee and the six district textile associations to reduce the allocation and change to other counts. This time, yarn below 10-count is 926 bales, a significant increase compared to previous allocations. There is a shortage of 20-count and 42-count common yarns, and the Reproduction Committee expressed difficulties regarding this. The payment period is from the 25th, 26th, 27th to the 31st of this month. Some decisions in the past were cancelled due to late payments, and this is currently being expedited. For small factories that jointly apply for yarn and have the association make the payment, the procedures are more complicated, and the association is urging them to do so promptly.

### Joint Allocation Office Continues Allocation; Oil Prices Gradually Stabilizing

[Our Newspaper Report] Cooking oil prices have been falling for several days, but rebounded yesterday. Cooking oil prices once rose close to the negotiated price limit.

According to a letter from lawyer Fei Xizhen, the shop has never sold black market oil, and the above news is not true. A correction is hereby made.

### Sudden Surge in Gold Market; Foreign Currencies Rebound Accordingly; Hong Kong Gold Prices Soar

Yesterday, the Central Bank's control was slightly relaxed, and buyers became excited and the price surge resumed. The morning opened at 2,500,500, and there was a scramble to buy, gradually rising. However, it was still relatively peaceful at first. At 10:00 AM, the Central Bank still allocated 200 bars at a price of 2,512,500. After that, the Central Bank made no further supply, and after 10:30 AM, people became very bullish, forming a scramble to buy. Near noon, the price rose to over 2,580,000 before the Central Bank supplied over 1,000 bars. At noon, it hovered around 2,565,000. In the afternoon, people were still bullish, and the next-day delivery rose to over 2,580,000 before being forced to retreat. As a result, the closing price rose by 67,000 compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold rose to 97,200, silver dollar and silver ingot fell back, and the black market interest rate remained between 12 and 15 cents.

### If Japanese Cocoons Don't Arrive, All Silk Factories Will Stop Production by the End of the Year; Japan Indeed Has Surplus Cocoons for Exchange

[Our Newspaper Report] All parties are still working hard on the matter of Japanese cocoons being shipped to China. Currently, in addition to the delegation to Japan and the MacArthur Headquarters continuing to negotiate, the Silk Factory Industry Association has telegraphed Ambassador Gu Weijun, requesting him to negotiate with the US government nearby. When Chu Fucheng goes to Beijing to participate in the National Assembly, he will also discuss with relevant authorities to promote an early resolution. Related personnel said: There are 90 silk factories of various sizes in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, employing more than 20,000 workers. The current shutdown of some factories is due to the oppression of high-interest loans, not due to raw material problems. However, if Japanese cocoons cannot be shipped to China, all factories will be forced to shut down by the end of December. The China Silk Company currently has only 9,000 dan of cocoons, and is planning to allocate 4,000 dan, which is still a drop in the bucket and will not help much, because 11,000 spinning machines can use it all up in one day if they are all operating. Recalling that at the beginning of our country's negotiations with the Allied Headquarters, the Headquarters refused our country's request for two reasons: First, our country lacks "multi-spindle cars", so the quality of silk is inferior and does not meet the needs of the United States; second, the selling price of Chinese silk in the United States is too high, which is not as cheap as Japanese silk. Later, the Japanese government suddenly added a point, that Japanese cocoons must all be used for their own purposes, and there are no surplus cocoons that can be shipped to China. In fact, Japan lost many machines during the war, and there are indeed surplus cocoons available for our country to use. At present, what our country is asking for is barter, not compensation; in fact, during the 26th year of the Republic of China alone, the Japanese took 260,000 dan of cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces alone, so it is reasonable to ask for compensation. Today, the raw material problem of silk factories can only be solved by shipping Japanese cocoons, because other silk-producing countries in the world currently have no surplus cocoons to sell.

### Import and Export Industry Gathering to Discuss Quota Allocation Issues

[Our Newspaper Report] The Import and Export Industry Association of this city convened a board meeting the day before yesterday and decided to first study the various regulations of the import license system in detail, and then each director will submit detailed opinions separately, and then convene a meeting again this Saturday to discuss. In the new import and export method, there are two points that need to be explained by the Management Committee: One is how the quota will be allocated. There are no clear regulations in the article. The association hopes to participate in some opinions, so that the competent authority can better understand the actual situation and make the allocation more reasonable and fair. It is decided that for the regulations on reviewing imports, such as whether the Central Bank will supply foreign exchange when reviewing and approving, there are also no regulations in the original article. Relevant personnel speculate that it will not be easy to engage in the import and export industry in the future, because those engaged in this industry must have certain qualifications and must be professional; import is more difficult due to various controls, and future development will inevitably focus on export. However, the export industry is also full of difficulties, such as high product costs and lack of transportation tools. Regarding the goods ordered in the United States before the 17th, the Management Committee has stipulated that only those who are on board and waiting for transportation can apply for permission, but according to reliable sources, the standard may be relaxed, that is, all goods approved for purchase by the Central Bank can generally be imported.

### Tea Market Weakens

After some tea merchants who were financially constrained unloaded their goods, the situation of the foreign firm tea market began to soften frequently. In terms of selling price, it remained stable at first, but then Chen Zhong Qimen fell to 135,000 yuan per dan, and the footings of other teas were extremely weak and unstable. Transactions were not smooth, and domestic sales of red and green teas were all lacking follow-up, and the process remained unchanged.

### Transshipment of Woolen Fabrics Continues to Arrive; The Future of Domestic Products is Dangerous

The trend of woolen fabrics has been consistently flat recently. If high-interest loans are not eliminated, all industries will be unable to maintain. Although large and small businesses now seem to make a slight profit, they are secretly losing money due to the consumption of demolition interest. British woolen fabrics are transshipped from Hong Kong, and Japanese woolen fabrics are shipped from various ports by American ships. Recently, they have arrived in Shanghai one after another. Because the prices are cheaper than domestic products, sales are quite strong. Domestic woolen fabrics were previously oppressed by American goods, and now they are hit by transshipped goods. In addition, the levying of goods tax raises costs. If this continues, both factories and merchants may face the danger of destruction.

### American Cotton Continues to Fall

[United Press News Agency, New York, 20th] Today, cotton prices fell slightly, and trading was flat. At closing, cotton futures fell by 1.35 to 2.25 cents per pound compared to the previous day. Also, New Orleans, 20th, cotton futures fell by 2.2 to 3.1 cents today.

### American Wheat Sets New High; Local Supply Situation Eases

According to a major figure in the flour industry: The raw materials for flour are currently transported from the Longhai Railway and northern Jiangsu from time to time. At the same time, the production and sales volume of flour has also decreased relatively in recent months, so the raw material problem has eased. The flour used in North China, in addition to being supplied by local production, is also transported to Jinan from Shanghai and Xixi by the Ministry of Food. As for ordering foreign wheat, manufacturers themselves do not have this power, and the export restrictions on wheat from the United States and Canada are extremely strict, and the consent of their governments must be obtained in advance, so manufacturers do not pay much attention to the arrival of foreign wheat in China.

[United Press News Agency, Chicago, 20th] Today, wheat prices hit a 26-year high, with spot wheat trading at $2.25 per bushel. This is the highest price since 1920.

### Business Recession; Four Companies Liquidated Yesterday

The business recession is deepening, and business bankruptcies and closures are common. Yesterday, the Yinda Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Xinda Jujube Factory, Yiyi Medicine Store, and China Merchant Shipping Company in this city announced the cessation of business and liquidation. It is reported that a large number of merchants may go bankrupt soon.

### American Silk Prices Look Low

[United Press News Agency, New York, 20th] Since the government auctioned Japanese silk in October, lowering the price by 75 cents per pound compared to before, American silk prices are expected to continue to fall. The auction price of raw silk in October is close to the minimum official price.

### Shanghai Stock Market Fluctuates; Transaction Volume Sets New Record; Short Sellers Become More Active in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the second phase of the China stock market opened for selection and trading. People still felt uneasy, and the market fluctuated and struggled a lot. In the morning, all stocks saw a high, and overnight short positions were hedged taking advantage of the high, and long positions were also closed. Soon, the price began to fall. At this time, because the difference between the current and deferred prices was very small, arbitrageurs could not operate, and there were occasional reverse arbitrage trades. Nos. 76, 229, 199, and 176 were sold off one after another, gradually declining. After 10:15, Nos. 151, 226, and 83 received them and rose again. However, No. 38 and No. 198 were sold, and they still struggled. At around 11:00, gold and banknotes soared, and the buying frenzy began. No. 226 traded Yong Yarn for immediate delivery, No. 233 and No. 76 traded Yong Yarn for spot delivery, and No. 33 traded Xinyi, so all stocks rose sharply to high prices. After this, the spot and deferred prices were pulled apart, causing arbitrage activity. Under the arbitrage sales of Nos. 186 and 207, they soon leveled off again. Near noon, Nos. 76 and 229 and others were supplied, and the long positions on the table scrambled to cut losses, and the situation became weak again, ending at a low price. Compared to the previous close, Xinguang rose slightly, and Yong Yarn, Maya, Xinyi, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell slightly to half a percent. Yonggong was still flat. Huafeng rose slightly due to the deferred delivery, and the trading was lively. Among the cold stocks, Xin Ya Li'an rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. In the afternoon, the market was almost entirely shorted by the exchange, and the market price was suppressed again with sparse transactions. Xian Yong Yarn retreated to a new low price of 552 yuan before struggling. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn and Maya fell by 3%, Jingfu fell by a little more than half a percent, Qinxing fell by a little less than 1%, Xinguang was flat, and Huafeng rose slightly. Yonggong was also flat, the cold stocks Xin Ya Li'an and Rong Sao were still flat, underwear fell sharply by 10%, and the rest fell slightly. The total transaction volume for the day was 31.23 million shares, setting a new record. The prices of various stocks outside the market were stable and unchanged.

The foreign stocks formed a consolidation yesterday. They showed a slight improvement at the opening, and Yisha once rose to over 7,000 yuan, but it was difficult to last. As a result, compared to the previous close, Navigation, Yipi, and Wheelock were still flat, and the rest rose slightly.

### Ministry of Education Repeatedly Requests Additional Education Rehabilitation Funds; Executive Yuan Has Approved 40 Billion Successively

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Education previously stated that due to the national education rehabilitation, transportation delays, and soaring prices, the original budget for rehabilitation funds was insufficient. It requested the Executive Yuan to add 120 billion yuan for rehabilitation funds. The Executive Yuan did not approve the original request due to the huge amount of funding. However, the national education rehabilitation, the national institutions and schools, either in transit or waiting for construction funds, the situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. The authorities of various institutions and schools have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Education for relief. The Ministry of Education repeatedly appealed to the Executive Yuan based on the situation. In the middle of last month and the beginning of this month, the Executive Yuan allocated 10 billion yuan each time. The Ministry of Education had already prepared for the emergency needs of various schools, and the funds issued by the Executive Yuan twice were used to repay the advances and distribute the remaining funds to various schools. This was just a drop in the bucket. Now, although most of the national colleges and universities above the junior college level have been rehabilitated, the travel expenses used by land, sea, and air have exceeded too much, and the funds received or borrowed from the Ministry of Education are still insufficient to return. The funds that were borrowed for urgent travel and the construction funds of various schools, due to the rise in prices of materials and labor, either cannot be completed or urgently need to be repaired, and all have requested the Ministry of Education to approve the additional budget as requested by various schools and issue the funds as soon as possible. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly petitioned the Executive Yuan to approve the previous request for an additional 120 billion yuan. It is reported that the Executive Yuan now agrees to allocate another 20 billion for education rehabilitation relief. The Ministry of Education will wait for the official document before handling the fund receipt procedures, and then approve the funds according to the actual needs of education rehabilitation at all levels, and issue additional rehabilitation funds to national schools. It is said that the Executive Yuan will no longer issue additional funds after this. If this is true, the total of 40 billion before and after, combined with the original 120 billion requested by the Ministry of Education, is only one-third of the total amount.

### Shanghai New Middle School Raises Funds for School Construction

Shanghai New Middle School was established in 1942 to protect Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School. For several years, under the difficult management of Principal Wu Ruinian and all the faculty and staff, the scale has been greatly improved. This semester, there are more than 1,000 students in total, and it has been approved by the Municipal Bureau of Education for recordation. However, the school site is leased, and the land is crowded, making it difficult to expand. The board of directors decided to launch a fundraising campaign for school construction, with a temporary target of 50 million yuan. The school is actively promoting it recently, and hopes that people from all walks of life and enthusiastic educationists will generously donate.

Biochemistry continued to press hard, creating a close situation of 27 to 30 and 29 to 32. Black's Shen Renshou made a free throw and then adopted delaying tactics.

### Victorious Return of the Expeditionary Wheel to Luoyang

Today Leaving Shanghai for Beijing, Passing Through Xu and Bian Back to the Route

The Expeditionary Wheel basketball team, organized by officers and soldiers of the 6th Regiment of the Luoyang Ordnance Corps, arrived in Shanghai from their garrison area in Hubei a month ago. They have been competing with various teams in the city for nearly two months and have achieved good results. They have also traveled to Beijing, Wuxi, and other places, winning all their games. Since returning to Shanghai from Beijing, the Philippine Islands Black team came to Shanghai for an expedition, so they stayed in Shanghai to meet the challenge, and as a result, they won again. The team originally planned to launch a full-scale expedition to South China, Hong Kong, and Guangdong. From there, they would take the Yuehan Railway to Hubei, and then return to their Luoyang garrison to report for duty. Yesterday afternoon, Wu Zhuoming, the leader of the Expeditionary Wheel, suddenly received a telegram from the regiment commander ordering them to return immediately because there were other official duties to be handled in the area. Therefore, Wu decided to take all the players on the 9:00 AM express train today and go straight to Nanjing, then transfer to Xuzhou. If time permits in Xuzhou, there will be one or two friendly matches. After the matches in Xuzhou, the entire team will go to Kaifeng to play two friendly matches with the Henan Province basketball champion Black Tiger team, as agreed upon, and then return to Luoyang to report.

According to Wu, the leader of the Expeditionary Wheel, he told reporters that the team's visit to Shanghai was warmly received and guided by the Shanghai City Sports Association, the Basketball Committee, various groups, and sports reporters from various newspapers. He is very grateful and will do his best to promote the vigorous atmosphere of the sports world in Shanghai to all parts of the mainland after returning to the garrison area. He plans to come to Shanghai again next year to learn from them.

### One Year Since the National Army Entered the Northeast

— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao of This Newspaper in the Northeast

(Shenyang Air Mail on the 16th) "The soldiers all yearn for genuine peace. If that is achieved, I am willing to take off my military uniform and put on a civilian robe!"

·Words of General Du Yuming·

General Du Yuming was appointed to command the National Army out of Shanhaiguan to take over sovereignty in the Northeast and maintain public security in the region. His Chief of Staff, Zhao Jiaxiang, assisted him in strategizing. November 16th marks exactly one year. In this year, from Shanhaiguan in the south to the Songhua River in the north, from the Shulu River in the west to the Yalu River in the east, everyone in the Northeast has an image of Commander Du in their minds. "The 52nd Army, the 13th Army, the New Sixth Army, the New First Army, the 71st Army, the 93rd Army, the 60th Army... Since last year, they have entered the Northeast one after another. Now, although some of these troops have been transferred to other places, they have all left a deep impression on the people of the Northeast.

Whenever the National Army recovered a city, General Du would personally go to inspect it. He visited various cities between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang, as well as Fushun, Sipingjie, Changchun, Chengde, Zhangjiakou, Chifeng..., He went once more when Andong was recovered. He walked into Andong under the large red banner hanging with the words: "Welcome General Du, whose fame fills the Southwest and whose prestige shakes the Northeast." The people of Andong lined the streets to welcome him, and the Koreans also waved their trigram flags.

General Du walked into Andong, saddened by the destruction of factories and concerned about the suffering of the people. Therefore, as soon as he took off his dusty uniform, he drove his own military jeep to visit businesses and residents, to comfort them. The people all expressed their past suffering with grateful faces and tones.

The people of Andong constantly recounted the two terms "liquidation" and "struggle" to the people who came here from afar, as if telling their grievances, telling everyone what it was all about. A family called "Dachang Dyeing Factory" was able to liquidate the false Manchurian currency of 30 million, and it is unknown how many others were liquidated for millions and hundreds of thousands. Some local people compared "struggle" to a tragic farce.

Unbearable to Witness the Destruction

At the foot of the Zhenjiang Mountain in Andong City, there are rows of Western-style small buildings with green roofs and yellow bricks, and some are villas with bright red tiles or tiled. From a distance, they are indeed quite beautiful. Walking closer, they also look quite elegant, but the doors and windows are gone. Walking inside, the scene in front of you is that the porcelain washbasins are smashed, the porcelain toilets have fallen, the floors have been lifted, and the lights have been moved. The walls are covered with slogans written in red and blue ink, such as "Brothers of the Central Army, don't fight for the xxx, your wives and children are waiting for you!" In addition, it is really a mixed bag of insults, advice, mockery, and some ditties. Scattered on the ground are leaflets and drawings printed by the "Political Department of the Liaodong Military Region of the Northeast Democratic United Army."

We entered and exited many exquisite small houses. Upstairs and downstairs, the scenes were the same. Destruction was accompanied by desolation. Everyone left as if they were mourning a battlefield. The green pines and blood-red leaves in several courtyards were supporting the scenery after the turmoil and destruction.

The station was empty and desolate. Half of the platform at the bridgehead was suspended in the air, and the whole thing was overturned. One or two old locomotives were burning firewood, roaring hoarsely. It is said that the good locomotives were dragged across the river by the communist army and exchanged for some ammunition. Many ships were lined up on the Jiang'an of Xinyizhou, and many materials were piled up on the shore. The people pointed and said: "Those are our things!"

In the past, Andong had an arsenal, which had been destroyed beyond recognition. In the three major papermaking plants, the "Yalu River" and "Andong" papermaking plants had some of their machines moved away by the communist army, and then they set fire to them. This was a major blow to the Shenyang newspaper industry, because everyone hoped that the Andong papermaking plant would solve most of the difficulty of the Shenyang newspaper industry's lack of paper. Now, only the privately-owned "Liuhecheng" papermaking plant is left, and the existing machines can only manufacture some paper money for sacrifices.

Only empty houses remain of the four textile factories. Among the three rubber factories, only the "Dongya" factory was less damaged and has the hope of resuming work in the short term. As for the light metal industry, the automobile factory, cement, chemical, and steel-making factories, etc., the people said that they had been taken away by the Soviet army long ago. Among these factories, the automobile factory was the largest in scale. In the past, it could produce 120 cars every day, but now everything is over. After two great calamities, Andong's industry has become irreparable.

Double-Edged Sword Combat, Mobile Warfare, Rapid Marches of 120 Li per Day

The National Army that recovered Andong this time was the 52nd Army, which fought hard battles in the Northeast. The army leader, Zhao Gongwu, said in Cantonese: "Our politics must improve, because politics is not keeping up with the military now." He also said: "The district offices and county governments of the communist army are ahead of the army, but our political workers are lagging far behind. In the future, we should use more young people, so that they don't shrink back when things happen."

The Second Division of the 52nd Army has been reorganized into the New Second Army. The army commander, Liu Yuzhang, recounted the Battle of Motianling. He described how the communist army defended to the death and how the National Army climbed the cliffs bare-chested, resulting in great sacrifices on both sides. Xiong Qilao, the squad leader of the National Army, used his head and body to block the communist army's firing point, and his tragic sacrifice earned the National Army's final victory.

Army Commander Zhao and Army Commander Liu led the National Army to Andong, creating a new record for speed. It is said that the divisions of the 52nd Army were originally stationed in the Anshan area in the southern section of the Middle East Railway. On October 18th, at 3:00 PM, they received orders and concentrated overnight. On the 19th, they set off from Anshan. On the 20th, they began to encounter the communist army, fighting and advancing. On the 21st, after a day of fighting, they captured Motianling. On the 22nd, they continued to advance, with rapid marches of 120 li per day. At 4:30 PM on the 25th, they arrived in Andong. The journey of more than 600 li, calculated, except for more than two days of fighting, it only took more than four days to rush. Therefore, the people of Andong said it was a "divine army descending from heaven!"

General Du said: In the past year, the "double-edged sword tactic" has been used to divide Lin Biao's "pocket tactic," mobile warfare has been used to counter Mao Zedong's "one point two sides," and the communist army's tactic of disrupting the front line with plainclothes men first, then using the people to defend them, and then using the army to defend the rear, advancing in order, the National Army used the method of firmly plugging the last army, which has achieved the best results. The war in the Northeast in the past year should no longer be fought after the Chairman issued the ceasefire order. General Du said: "The soldiers all yearn for genuine peace. If that is achieved, I am willing to take off my military uniform and put on a civilian robe."

Building a New World in the Northeast

In order to build the Northeast and educate the children of the Northeast, General Du united with people from all walks of life to establish a "Zhongzheng University." In the Peace District, the original Japanese Girls' High School, the "Xingya Hall," the "Kanglong Pavilion," and other damaged houses have been rebuilt. From the mouth of Nan Yi Tiao Ma Road to the mouth of Nan Wu Tiao Ma Road, it occupies two streets horizontally and is extremely magnificent. The faculty lineup is also very impressive. The future development is limitless. The students in the Northeast, who have been in a chaotic situation for years, are now settled here, bathing in the spring breeze.

The Japanese Shrine in Shenyang used to be very famous in the Northeast. Every day, countless Japanese men and women came to pay their respects there, and the daily income from donations was also considerable. After the restoration on August 15th, it suddenly became deserted. Some troops were stationed in the empty and tidy place. This went on for a year.

In order to eliminate this symbol of Japan's victory in invading the Northeast, General Du rebuilt it into the "Memorial Shrine for Fallen Soldiers." The cement archway in front of the Japanese shrine that everyone was accustomed to seeing had its top removed and became a very good double-cross archway representing our National Day. The hall in the courtyard was repainted with red paint, and memorial tablets were placed inside, with the national emblem painted on the top. All traces of the enemy and the puppet regime were renovated as much as possible, so the whole view was changed. The ancient pines and temples are quiet and tidy, making it a good place for the heroic souls to rest in peace.

On November 16th, the anniversary of the National Army's entry into Shanhaiguan, a ceremony was held to inaugurate the Shrine for Fallen Soldiers. All circles in Shenyang expanded the army condolence on this day and presented flags to Director Xiong Bin of the Headquarters, Commander Du Yuming, General Peng Bisheng, and Director Yu Jizhong. In addition, more than ten religious and cultural groups specially erected a black velvet curtain inside the shrine, expressing their gratitude to the heroic spirits of the National Army and praying for peace in the Northeast as soon as possible.

The ceasefire order has been issued. The National Assembly has been convened. Peace is showing in the Central Plains and the Northeast. There can be no more civil strife, no more destruction. For the sake of national prosperity and survival, the people unanimously demand that everyone jointly extinguish the wildfires that have been unquenchable in Guandong for more than a year, so as to build a new world in the Northeast!

General Du Yuming Giving a Speech

### New Appointed Siamese Ambassador to China is Nai Sashi · Durarat

— This Newspaper's Travelogue Correspondent Huang Jiesun

Bangkok Air Mail, 6th

"Chinese and Siamese people are very similar and difficult to distinguish. Their blood relationship is particularly inseparable. If you casually ask any Siamese person on the street, they will tell you that their grandfather or great-grandfather was Chinese."

The Siamese Prime Minister once told me this. The Prime Minister who said these words was himself the son of a Chinese man. Generally speaking, those holding prominent positions in Siam are descendants of overseas Chinese. Nai Sashi. Durarat (Sanguan Tularak), who was recently appointed as the Ambassador to China, is also the son of a Chinese man. If based on Chinese nationality laws, they are all Chinese citizens.

Nai Sashi participated in the June 24th coup. After the success of this bloodless revolution, he served as a high-ranking official during the governments of Phraya Phahon and Luang Phibuns, but without a specific title. When the Pacific War broke out and Japanese troops occupied Siam, he escaped from the grip of the Japanese army and went to Chongqing, then to the United States and the United Kingdom, advocating for a "Free Thai" movement. He had extensive interactions with people from all walks of life in our country, and gradually became known to the world. After the war in Siam, he was an assistant in the Ministry of Education and chairman of the war crimes investigation group. Although his position was not high, he was a person under observation on the political stage of Siam.

Post-war Siam was restricted by others in politics, economics, and even military affairs. At the same time, French soldiers were invading its borders. It was truly a situation of looking around and finding no one to call for help. Many people with insight turned to China. Nai Sashi can be said to be one of the leaders. After the United States and the United Kingdom, followed by France, put forward new demands to Siam, they simultaneously sent ultimatums to Siam, demanding that Siam return the four provinces. This was a major lesson for the anti-Chinese elements in Siam, and the general public also understood China's goodwill. Even Nai Biri, who was known for his anti-Chinese and pro-British stance, first made a special trip to visit our country. If Nai Sashi can perform well, he will undoubtedly become a heavyweight in the future political arena of Siam.

In Siam, Nai Sashi associated mostly with our country's overseas Chinese businessmen and personnel stationed in Siam. I also met him often. He has a completely Chinese appearance and a completely Chinese spirit. When his appointment as the Ambassador to China was officially announced with our country's approval, I asked him what he thought of it. He frankly said:

"I am very happy. This gives me the best opportunity to engage in promoting a deeper understanding and connection between China and Siam."

His wife and one son and one daughter lived in Chongqing for more than a year. His daughter speaks fluent Mandarin, and she excitedly said to me in Mandarin:

"Dad is going to Nanjing, and my mother and I will go soon too. – I like China."

Nai Sashi is currently forty-four years old; his wife is forty-two years old. His daughter is twenty years old; his son is eighteen years old and went to the United States to study two months ago. His father, Zhang Liangsheng, just passed away a few years ago. In his home, there still hangs a large golden character "Shou" (longevity) and a congratulatory couplet presented by his relatives on his father's eighty-second birthday: "Peach blossoms have bloomed in three layers of waves, a sign of longevity and auspicious omens in the five-colored clouds."

Nai Sashi is scheduled to leave for Nanjing in the middle of this month. For him, we cannot simply regard him as an envoy of Siam, as we would for other countries. We should see him as a descendant of China who has been living abroad, newly returning from a foreign land!

At the same time, we must also know that Siam has deep expectations for China. We should give her support and care, so that she can grow and become strong. – This is a task for our China, and it is also a responsibility that our China should bear.

### The Three Barrenness of Hefei

— Our Newspaper's Reporter in Anhui, Bai Ping

16th Dispatch

Autumn is deep, and the people living in Hefei have intimately felt the meaning of early winter. You see, the Hongshang Cuigai, Tender Lotus, and Fresh Lotus of the Baogong River are now just a pool of autumn water, and the scenery is desolate. As for Xiaoyaojin, except for withered grass and fallen leaves, accompanied by a pool of stagnant water, there is nothing else. On the streets, pedestrians are trying out their winter clothes, which already look hazy. By evening, just past nine o'clock, the shops close one after another, making it lonely to walk the streets. This deep autumn season, Hefei is much more desolate than summer!

The number of people returning from recovery is gradually increasing, and civil servants from various counties are constantly coming to the provincial capital for official business. Although it has become the political center of Anhui today, the ancient atmosphere is still undiminished from previous years. Whether living here or passing through here, as long as you have stayed in the Shanghai-Nanjing area, you will also experience the emptiness in life and see the three major barrenness of Hefei today: the housing barrenness, the entertainment barrenness, and the fuel barrenness.

Housing Barrenness: It's Difficult to Find Even After Wearing Out Your Shoes

Hefei spent eight years of suffering under the clutches of the Japanese invaders. Eight years, the time should be considered long enough. The enemy did not build here, but destroyed. Coupled with the illegal requisition of bricks, tiles, wood, and stone materials, as well as several bombings before the fall of the city, when the provincial government moved from Lihuang last year after the victory, only half of the buildings in Hefei's urban area remained. These remaining half of the buildings were mostly dilapidated, making it difficult to avoid wind and rain. After more than a year, although there has been some renovation and new construction, it is still far from meeting the demand, forming today's serious housing problem.

The first to feel the threat are the family members of civil servants who find it difficult to arrange housing. They repeatedly ask friends and plead for favors, but in the end, they only get a few dilapidated small houses. This was still the situation last year. In the past six months, if you want to rent a house, you will feel like you have "worn out your shoes and still can't find a place." The reporter has walked through many streets and alleys here, and sees that every household is packed to the brim. Even the dormitories originally rented by the government for unmarried civil servants have beds next to each other, no different from the steerage section of a ship. Furthermore, some important personnel here have had to come without their families because it is too difficult to find housing. Mr. Liu Zhenru, the chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Mr. Pu Mengjiu, the Director of the Finance Department, have become unmarried civil servants here, living with their colleagues. There is a joke here about housing: when Mr. Pu Mengjiu came to Anhui to take over as the Director of the Finance Department, he took over the house rented by the previous Director Gui. Who knew that the landlord wanted to increase the rent and blocked the door, not allowing Mr. Pu to move his luggage in. Mr. Pu was unable to enter and had no choice but to agree to the landlord's high price request before he could unload his luggage. Yes, in Hefei today, where housing is severely barren, it is fortunate to have a house to live in, so why bother to avoid the landlord's exploitation?

The reporter arrived here that day, because the ship arrived late, and could not find a hotel after entering the city. With great difficulty, I stayed overnight at a small inn where "the rooster crows early to see the sky." The next day, I moved to the Victory Hotel. The Victory Hotel is a guesthouse set up by the provincial government. There is no such hotel in Hefei. The rooms and hospitality are very good, and it is stipulated that there is no charge. However, the reporter moved in only as a temporary measure, so I have now moved to the Social Apartment. This is run by the Social Service Department. Although the rooms are small, the fees are slightly lower than those of general inns and hotels. Here, I should thank them for providing convenience to the reporter.

The housing barrenness in Hefei does not seem to have a proper solution at present. First of all, the provincial government's establishment is not permanently in Hefei. Although the offices of various departments are cramped, they have to make do for the time being. The civil servants themselves also feel that since the provincial government will move back to Anqing, why bother building their own houses? Just live as best they can. As for the people, everyone feels the pressure of life. If they have a house to squat in, they will just squeeze in. If it is really impossible, they will build more thatched houses to live in temporarily, and then make plans after catching their breath. In this way, the government has no intention of building, and private individuals have no power to build. The housing barrenness is allowed to continue!

Entertainment Barrenness: A Lack of Joy is Also a Kind of Joy

Whether you live at home or work as a civil servant, the feeling of everyone is that life is too monotonous, and young friends feel even more isolated. If you want to find entertainment to adjust your life, it will be enough to make you rack your brains.

There is now one Peking opera theater and two cinemas in Hefei, but you can't find any entertainment. In terms of Peking opera, the artistic level of the performers is certainly low enough, and the plays performed are not satisfactory either. The plays that are often performed are things like "Baochan Sends Wine", "Spider Cave", and "Spinning Cotton", or sometimes they are new plays written and performed by themselves. Many scenes are very far-fetched and tasteless, only giving the young lads a little subconscious stimulation. As for the movies, colorful foreign films are certainly not appreciated here, and most of the domestic films are pre-war films or toxic works made by fallen stars during the Anti-Japanese War. Films such as "Meng Lijun", "Plum Blossom Falling", "Biro Princess," "Wild Rose," and "Xiao Xiang Night Rain" are all welcomed here. This is definitely not because the audience's standards are low, it's just that they can't find any entertainment and have to "take medicine locally"! As a result, Peking opera and film theaters are packed.

Other than that, there are no dance halls, no parks, and not even a small teahouse to sit in. No matter where you go, apart from meeting friends to chat, you can only feel stuffy in the house!

The reporter believes that it would be best for the provincial government to initiate the organization of a drama club to hold regular evening parties, and at the same time, properly guide the commercially run theaters, teach them how to improve. This will not only partially solve the entertainment barrenness of the people, but also help improve administrative efficiency.

Fuel Barrenness: Bald Mountains Without End.

Speaking of fuel, the problem is quite serious. There are currently 55,000 to 60,000 people in Hefei, and the daily consumption of fuel is considerable. Moreover, the main sources of fuel are wild grass, firewood, and charcoal. Although it is less than ninety kilometers from Hefei to the Huainan Coal Mine, the Huainan Mine Railway has not been restored below Shuijiahu, and the coal production is transported to Bengbu and then sold along the Lianpu and Longhai Railways. A small amount of bituminous coal produced by the Yufeng Coal Mine in Chaoxian County is also transported to Hefei, but only bathhouses and restaurants use it. Residents never buy it. Therefore, wild grass, firewood, and charcoal sell in large quantities.

Wild grass, firewood, and charcoal are mostly produced in the western countryside of Hefei, and are transported to the city entirely by human labor or wheelbarrows. Wild grass grows widely in the mountains and fields, so its value is relatively low, with a selling price of over 5,000 yuan per load. As for firewood and charcoal, their value is high. Firewood requires a minimum of 10,000 yuan per load, while charcoal is 32,000 yuan. Recently, seeing that the snowy winter is coming soon, firewood and grass will one day be available for money but not for sale, so residents are storing a little. As a result, things are scarce and expensive, and prices are gradually rising. Some people are even starting to do this kind of business. For example, in terms of firewood, some people go to the countryside to contact the villagers, agreeing on a price for a tree, which is not high in value originally. After he cuts it down and transports it to the city, it becomes ten times the price. In this way, there is a way to make money, so many people are doing this business. The trees in the countryside are decreasing day by day, and the prices in the city are increasing day by day. If this situation continues for a long time, it is a small matter for consumers to spend a few more dollars, but the trees in the countryside are not only not increasing but are being cut down every day, which is even more serious. In recent years, our country has made some efforts in afforestation, but there is afforestation here, but no forest protection. On the contrary, there is competition in felling forests. What do you say about this? At present, the cost of fuel in Hefei is higher than using coal, and the four townships are full of bare mountains. In the future, the price of firewood and charcoal will only increase day by day, and the forests in the countryside will decrease day by day. The fuel barrenness will also become more and more serious.

### New Talks on Medical Circles

One Thousand Cases of Clinical Trials of Streptomycin

Streptomycin, also known as Streptomycin, is the most promising antibiotic after Penicillin. Starting in March of this year, the United States government united relevant parties to conduct large-scale clinical trials in an organized and planned manner to determine its therapeutic value. The Chemotherapy Drug Committee of the National Research Institute is also one of the participating organizations. Recently, Keefer et al. published the results of a clinical trial of one thousand cases in the September issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The full text is over 20,000 words and is one of the most important documents on this element. The main points have been selected and included in the book "Penicillin, Streptomycin, and Other Antibiotics" (this book is the revised third edition of "The Therapeutics of Penicillin").

Therapeutic Value of Streptomycin

As far as is currently known, streptomycin is the most effective therapeutic agent for tularemia, Haemophilus influenzae infections, urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli, and bacteremia and meningitis caused by such bacteria.

The therapeutic results of streptomycin for brucellosis, rat-bite fever, and Salmonella infections (i.e., paratyphoid fever, etc.) are highly questionable and difficult to judge at present.

Regarding the efficacy of various types of tuberculosis, streptomycin does have considerable value, but it is only an auxiliary therapy to the current standard therapy and should not be relied upon as the only therapy. For disseminated tuberculosis such as miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, and laryngeal tuberculosis, streptomycin has the effect of inhibiting the propagation of tubercle bacilli and preventing the progression of the disease. It also has the same therapeutic effect on exudative pulmonary tuberculosis.

Practical Application of Streptomycin

There are many practical difficulties in the clinical application of streptomycin.

First, the current production is limited. The products of various factories in the United States are all bought by government agencies, and it is extremely difficult to buy on the market. Even if you can buy it, its value is extremely high, about eight US dollars per gram. The daily dose is between two and five grams. For tuberculosis, treatment should last at least three to six months. For other infections, it should last at least one or two weeks.

Second, when using this element, if the dose is insufficient, the bacteria in the body are extremely prone to developing drug resistance, which will make the treatment ineffective. Therefore, if it is decided to use this element for treatment, a sufficient dose must be used from the beginning and must be continued to the end. Because the supply is currently difficult, the entire amount of medicine needed for several weeks or even months must be purchased before starting treatment so that the treatment will not be interrupted and drug-resistant bacteria will be produced.

Third, streptomycin has considerable toxicity. There have been reports of several deaths in the United States due to the use of this element. Therefore, it should be used with caution and should not be administered intravenously.

However, these difficulties are not insurmountable. It is estimated that most of them will be resolved by this time next year.

### Eye Hygiene

— Miao Lian'en

The eyes are the head of the five senses and have a close relationship with health. It is needless to say that the pain of losing sight is unspeakable. Looking at the people of our country who are blinded by eye diseases, it is quite numerous. If everyone has appropriate hygiene knowledge of the eyes, it can not only prevent diseases but also increase happiness. The origins of eye diseases and their prevention methods are briefly described on the left:

(1) Congenital Eye Diseases: Some eye diseases are inherited from ancestors and occur continuously in a family, such as congenital cataracts and color blindness. The former can be removed by surgery, but the lack of vision makes it impossible to handle delicate work. The latter may not be able to work in the transportation industry because they cannot distinguish between red and green. Some are harmful to children due to the consanguinity of parents, such as retinitis pigmentosa. Patients may not feel any difference in childhood, but by the time they reach adolescence and middle age, they feel night blindness, vision gradually declines, and the field of vision (range of vision) gradually shrinks. Thus, the patient only sees what is directly in front of them and cannot see to the sides. Some are caused by parents' sexually transmitted diseases to their children, such as congenital syphilis, which also causes eye diseases, resulting in disability. There are also cases of parents' myopia being inherited by their daughters. Therefore, to prevent such diseases, pay close attention to the choice of a spouse. Mothers with syphilis should be treated early to eliminate syphilis, so that a healthy baby can be produced in the future.

(2) Acquired Eye Diseases. (A) Infectious Eye Diseases: Infectious eye diseases are all caused by bacteria or microorganisms, such as acute conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, trachoma, and gonococcal ophthalmia. Mothers or nannies with conjunctivitis or trachoma are most likely to transmit it to infants due to close contact. Children's toys and hands must be kept clean at all times to prevent bacteria from entering the eyes. Adults easily carry bacteria into their eyes by touching banknotes, newspapers, doorknobs, faucets, tickets, and objects in all public places. Therefore, avoid rubbing your eyes with your hands on weekdays. If necessary, use a clean handkerchief instead. It is especially important to develop the habit of washing hands. The patient's washing utensils should be completely separated from those used by family members, and they should seek medical treatment patiently, as trachoma cannot be cured in a short period of time. Mothers with gonorrhea have gonorrhea that enters the baby's eyes when the baby passes through the birth canal. On the third day after birth, the eyelids swell and drain pus. If not treated immediately, the eyeballs will be perforated and blind. Modern obstetricians use eye inflammation prevention methods for newborns, so the disease rate is lower than before. Internal diseases that can cause eye diseases include meningitis, measles (commonly known as measles), typhoid fever, dysentery, malaria, nephritis, typhus, relapsing fever, diabetes, acquired syphilis, and tuberculosis. Blindness in children due to infectious diseases is common, and the biggest reason is malnutrition, especially the lack of vitamin A. (B) Non-Infectious Eye Diseases: Refractive errors (referring to myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia), strabismus, cataracts, and injuries all belong to this category. Those with refractive errors often feel inconvenient at work and should have their vision carefully examined and fitted with glasses by an expert to improve vision and eliminate self-exertion fatigue. If strabismus is found in children, the eyes should also be examined first, because most of the strabismus in children is caused by refractive errors. We should try our best to dispel the misconception that "wearing glasses will make your eyes worse." For prevention, babies' toys should have thick lines and not attract the baby's attention. The light in the bedroom should not directly illuminate the head, and the head should be against the window and the lamp. The fonts in children's books should be large, and they should sit upright and maintain a proper distance between their eyes and the book, about twelve to fourteen inches. Tilting the head to read and write must be corrected. If you cannot see the words on the blackboard in the classroom and feel eye swelling, head swelling, or pain after reading, it is a phenomenon of refractive error and you must ask an expert to examine it. Often, once you put on glasses, you will feel comfortable as usual. Cataracts should also be treated by experts, and most of them need to be surgically removed. With the gradual development of modern industry, eye injuries are often seen, which can affect vision, reduce work efficiency, or cause blindness, causing lifelong harm. Both labor and capital should be strictly protected. Electric welders wear anti-glare glasses, and blacksmiths wear anti-iron glasses, which can avoid many injuries. Minor injuries are often delayed for treatment, so injuries that could have been cured become incurable, especially when chemicals accidentally enter the eyes. Wash immediately with water, then go to the doctor for treatment, and the hope of recovery is high.

### Chronic Otitis Media

— Wang Pengwan

Its Pathology and Treatment Principles

Before discussing this topic, we should first explain the definitions of "chronic" and "otitis media." Most otorhinolaryngology authorities believe that if acute suppurative otitis media does not cause any serious symptoms after six months but continues to have pus discharge, it can be called chronic otitis media. Six months is actually a very broad limit, as most cases develop into a chronic state before six months. As for the otitis media referred to in this article, it is suppurative otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation and frequent pus discharge. It should not be confused with the commonly known chronic catarrhal otitis media.

The principles of treatment for chronic otitis media are entirely based on its classification. The classification is briefly described below:

According to histology, the tympanic membrane can be divided into two parts: the pars tensa and the pars flaccida. According to expert statistics and our experience, chronic otitis media with perforation in the pars tensa, regardless of the amount of pus or the severity of the odor, never leads to serious complications. Serious complications refer to life-threatening diseases such as meningitis, inner ear suppuration, lateral sinus thrombosis, blood poisoning, and brain abscess. Conversely, tympanic membrane perforation in the pars flaccida often leads to the above-mentioned serious complications after several years or decades. As for mastoid perforation and postauricular abscess, they are considered less severe complications. In cases of chronic otitis media with pars flaccida perforation, at least 90% have cholesteatoma-like masses in the middle ear and mastoid. These cholesteatoma-like masses gradually grow, erode the surrounding bone tissue, and promote bacterial infection, which causes various serious complications.

Therefore, based on the location of the tympanic membrane perforation, chronic otitis media can be divided into two types. Perforation in the pars tensa never causes any serious complications and is called simple chronic otitis media. Perforation in the pars flaccida often leads to serious complications and is called cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media.

These two types of chronic otitis media can be diagnosed not only by the location of the perforation but also by using trial therapy and mastoid X-rays to distinguish them. If the pus discharged from the ear, no matter how strong the odor, does not have cholesteatoma-like masses, the odor can be completely eliminated after ten days of irrigation, ear drops, and nasopharyngeal disinfection. However, if cholesteatoma-like masses are present, the discharge, no matter how small, cannot have its odor reduced by any treatment. In addition, X-rays of the mastoid can also prove which type of chronic otitis media it is, as cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media often has special shadows in the mastoid.

Simple chronic otitis media is a harmless disease, while cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media is an extremely dangerous disease. Therefore, we can stipulate that the treatment principle for simple chronic otitis media should aim at keeping the middle ear clean, while the treatment principle for cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media should aim at reducing the possibility of life-threatening complications.

To keep the ear clean in simple chronic otitis media, attention should be paid to the external auditory canal and the Eustachian tube. Maintaining the cleanliness of the external auditory canal is relatively simple. Irrigation followed by ear drops (such as boric acid saturated in 70-degree alcohol) used several times a day can make it quite clean. When the pus decreases, the frequency of treatment should also be reduced until there is no pus, then the treatment can be stopped. During the treatment or during the period of stopping the treatment, the external auditory canal should be blocked with cotton to prevent dust or dirty water from entering. Maintaining the cleanliness of the Eustachian tube is more difficult because the Eustachian tube has close relationships with the nasopharynx, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses. If the patient is a child, attention should be paid to the condition of the tonsils and adenoid hypertrophy. If the patient is an adult, the paranasal sinuses should be strictly examined and treated appropriately to keep the Eustachian tube clean.

To eliminate the possibility of cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media causing life-threatening complications, surgery should be used to remove the cholesteatoma-like mass from the middle ear and mastoid. The standard operation is mastoidectomy.

In summary, the treatment of chronic otitis media should be prescribed according to its classification. Simple chronic otitis media does not endanger life, and the principle of treatment is to keep the middle ear clean, and the middle ear itself does not require surgery. However, cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media has the possibility of endangering life, and surgical treatment is its only treatment method.

### New Anti-malarial Drugs

— Zhang Ming

Because the entire world's quinine production is almost entirely concentrated in the Dutch East Indies, both World Wars saw belligerent countries devote themselves to the research of antimalarial drugs due to the threat and resulting panic of cutting off quinine supplies.

During World War I, Germany worked hard to find quinine substitutes during the blockade. Although it did not benefit during the war, it finally invented two synthetic antimalarial drugs, Pamaquine and Atebrin, after the war.

During this war, Germany did not have any important achievements in this area, but scientists from the United Kingdom, the United States, and China have made considerable achievements after years of effort. The United Kingdom invented Paludrine, which is completely different chemically from known antimalarial drugs, thus opening up a new path for antimalarial drug research, so its potential importance may be greater than its actual importance. It has strong efficacy, few side effects, and the possibility of reducing recurrence rates. The United States has conducted extremely large-scale research on antimalarial drugs, studying no less than thousands of drugs. Among the published drugs, Chloroquine is the most outstanding. This drug has very strong efficacy, is quick and lasting, greatly reduces recurrence rates, and has fewer side effects than Atebrin. This drug was synthesized by the Germans early on, but they abandoned it because they thought the efficacy was not good; the Americans adopted better research methods and discovered its many advantages. Our country also conducted research on anti-therapeutic drugs during the War of Resistance, but due to the simplicity of the equipment and the harsh working environment, no important discoveries were made. The only thing worth mentioning is the scientific proof of the anti-malarial efficacy of Changshan. The continued research on this drug has now been moved from Chongqing to Shanghai. The several crystalline components obtained in Chongqing are now being refined again, hoping to clarify their chemical structure. As for the actual value of Changshan, it cannot be determined at present, because the currently obtained active ingredients are still quite toxic.

### Prevention of Beriberi - One of Discussions on Improving Health among Ordinary People

— Ni Zhangqi

People who do not appear to be sick sometimes feel weak, easily fatigued, or have numbness in certain parts of their body, or leg pain, etc. It starts lightly and gradually worsens. These patients often continue to carry out their business. However, because of weakness and fatigue, business is repeatedly lost. Hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers suffer reduced products or poor quality due to weakness and fatigue. If it is piecework or self-cultivation, then the farmers and workers themselves suffer losses; if it is monthly salary, then the company suffers losses. Little by little, accumulated across the country, the annual loss is shocking, but for hundreds or thousands of years, such losses have continued, and only recently has anyone paid attention to it.

Without appropriate treatment or prevention, the disease continues to progress, the efficiency of work continues to decline, and the losses to individuals and society continue to increase; if treatment is never given and the diet is not improved, there is also a danger to life.

Weakness, numbness, and pain can occur for many different reasons, and one cannot rely solely on one simple method to prevent the various diseases caused by many different reasons. The method discussed in this article specifically refers to the prevention of one disease caused by the same reason, that is, specifically refers to the prevention of so-called "beriberi." Many people mistakenly call a skin disease (commonly known as "athlete's foot") beriberi, so the words "weakness, numbness, and pain" are specially put forward to be eye-catching, which can avoid misunderstandings.

Not every symptom of weakness, numbness, and pain in every beriberi patient needs to be completely evident at the same time. The common initial symptoms are fatigue and weakness. During this period, the patient himself does not admit that he is sick, and others do not know that he is sick. Although the patient works as usual, the events of doing poorly and slow delays increase day by day, and the amount of work that can be done each day is reduced compared to before.

Feeling weak, easily fatigued, and unable to exert strength are very common symptoms of beriberi (this is not athlete's foot, which causes itching between the toes). During this period, according to ordinary people's views, it is not considered a disease, but the reduction in work efficiency has already caused economic losses in the career. Later, symptoms such as numbness and pain appear, and the work efficiency will naturally be further reduced, and the losses suffered in the career will naturally be greater.

In the past, many people in the Philippine and Japanese armies suffered from this disease. Later, the disease was completely prevented from appearing in the army by replacing white rice with brown rice (newly hulled grain that has not yet gone bad). Many people in the Philippines do not use brown rice instead of white rice, so this disease has not disappeared in the Philippines. The number of people who died from this disease in the Philippines in 1927 was more than 17,000, and in 1937 there were still more than 16,797 people. Calculating one death out of every ten patients, then the number of people in the Philippines who suffer from this disease every year is around 170,000, and the total number in ten years is more than 1.7 million.

Our Chinese population is dozens of times larger than the Philippines, and the number of people suffering from this disease, although there are no accurate statistics, is approximately several million annually. Taking only the initial patients with fatigue, weakness, numbness, and pain, the loss from these millions of illnesses is already alarming.

But these kinds of suffering from fatigue, weakness, numbness, and pain, and the resulting losses in career and work, all have simple and reliable prevention methods, which are easy to implement and do not require any expenditure. There are two prevention methods: (1) The rice porridge eaten at each meal should be cooked with steamed rice, not with raw rice (i.e., ordinary white rice); (2) Or use brown rice instead of white rice, that is, eat brown rice regularly.

The second method needs no explanation. In places that produce wheat but not rice, brown flour can be used to replace white flour. Brown flour (that is, black flour with bran and wheat germ) is cheaper than white flour, and the price of brown rice is definitely not more expensive than white rice, so this method does not require any increase in cost. If you dislike the roughness and it is not palatable, you can use steamed white rice from the first method.

### Method of Making Steamed Rice

Farmers in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, and many neighboring villages make steamed rice themselves in their spare time. The tools and methods used are common and simple. First, put a layer of rice straw (clean cloth is also acceptable) on the bottom of the steamer, put the unsoaked grain in the steamer (bamboo steamers can also be used to steam steamed buns and cakes), and put the steamer on top of the pot and steam it with the hot steam coming from the pot. After steaming for about an hour, take out the grain steamer, then bake it, dry it, and wind it to make the grain dry. After steaming, the grain should be dried quickly and completely. The dried steamed grain can be dehusked and debranned to make semi-brown or completely white steamed rice.

Changxing County and neighboring villages produce a lot of indica rice, so indica rice is used to make steamed rice, which is called cooked gluten or cooked rice grain when sold in rice shops. Unsteamed indica rice is called raw indica rice (raw rice). Each dou of cooked rice (that is, steamed rice) cooks into more white rice than each dou of raw rice (ordinary white rice) (cooking makes steamed rice expand more than raw rice). Therefore, although the price of steamed rice is slightly more expensive, steamed rice white rice is not slightly more expensive than ordinary white rice rice. Therefore, using steamed rice to increase public health does not require any daily expenditure.

Any high-quality or low-quality grain can be made into steamed rice. If the method of steaming whole grains is used to steam shelled wheat, then the health of the people in the northern provinces can be improved without adding any costs.

The Vitamin B1 in steamed white rice is still very rich, and it can definitely prevent the suffering of fatigue, numbness, and pain caused by "beriberi." All the advantages of brown rice and ordinary top-quality white rice are also fully possessed by steamed white rice, but without their disadvantages.

For thousands of years, many villages, towns, districts, and counties in Jiang, Zhejiang, and other provinces have had the custom of eating steamed rice, and since there is this fact in history and custom, it is easy to take advantage of the situation to promote the production, sales, and cooking of steamed rice. Promote it from dozens of villages, towns, and counties to thousands of cities and towns, and from Jiang and Zhejiang to all provinces in the country and major grain-producing countries in the world. People in big cities can entrust rice shops or relatives and friends in rural villages to order from the rural areas that produce steamed rice. Since there is a lot of demand, farmers are not worried about having no sales channels and will be willing to produce more steamed rice.

China has always had many production sites of steamed rice, scattered in many rural families. The manufacturing method is simple and does not require any machinery, equipment, capital, wages, etc. It is easy and effortless, and any farm family can steam it.

### Mental Patients are Also People

— Xia Zhenyi

In the world, there are millions of men and women living in the abyss of pain. They can hear sounds that others cannot hear, and they can see images that other people's eyes cannot see. They can also think of many bizarre thoughts that are beyond reason. Sometimes they show smiles on the surface, but their hearts contain pain. Sometimes they are silent and calm, but their inner thoughts are like thousands of horses galloping, rising and falling, or filled with anxiety, fear, and doubt. Therefore, dignified people can become shameless, honest people can become deceitful, lively people become dull, and happy people become depressed.... In other words, their entire lives have deviated from the norms of reality and entered an uncontrollable fantasy realm. These people are the most unfortunate mental patients in the world. Even more unfortunate is that we have always given them a terrible name: "lunatics." The feeling generated from this name is terrible and contemptuous. Therefore, people not only do not sympathize with mental patients as they do with physical illnesses, but on the contrary, society's attitude towards mental patients is still inevitably cold, discriminatory, contemptuous, and inhumane. We should shout out loudly for them from a humanitarian standpoint: "Mental patients are also people."

Before the nineteenth century, everyone was superstitious that mental patients were possessed by demons and due to the punishment of the gods. Therefore, the treatment of mental patients was inhumane. At that time, so-called treatment was only imprisonment and abuse. They were imprisoned in wooden cages for life, tied with iron chains with rattles, and were often subjected to vicious beatings, isolated from society, and left to fend for themselves. It was like treating prisoners; no, it was simply not human life. It was truly as brutal as treating livestock. It was not until 1792 that Philippe Pinel began to implement the movement to release mental patients in Salpetriere, Paris. He removed the iron chains in the hospital and replaced them with humane treatment. Unfortunately, his power could not extend beyond the Paris area, but he vigorously refuted the erroneous view that mental illness was caused by demons and advocated using humane and compassionate methods to treat them, which influenced the attitude of ordinary people towards mental patients later on. Later, Miss Dorothea L. Dix in the United States continued to work hard and appeal on behalf of mental patients. As a result, 32 modern mental hospitals were established in California. From then on, the treatment of mental patients broke away from a tragic situation and gradually saw the dawn. In 1902, Clifford W. Beers, a Yale graduate in Connecticut, USA, suffered from mental illness and spent three years of inhumane life in public and private mental hospitals. He personally suffered all kinds of cruel and violent treatment from doctors and nurses in the hospital and witnessed the various sufferings of other patients. He was deeply moved. Therefore, after recovering from his illness and being discharged from the hospital, he vowed to dedicate the remaining years of his life to the general public of pitiful mental patients. He appealed to all parties and devoted his life to preventing mental illness. He also universally improved the treatment of mental patients and corrected the discriminatory attitude towards mental patients from the humanitarian standpoint of "mental patients are also people." He also wrote a masterpiece in vivid language about his life in the hospital—"A Mind That Found Itself." He is truly the originator of the mental health movement and the great benefactor of mental patients all over the world.

Although the wheels of the times have progressed to the atomic age today, mental patients in advanced European and American countries have been freed from the shackles of inhumane treatment and can receive scientific treatment like other diseases. Looking back at the situation in our country, how can we not feel heartbroken for millions of fellow citizens with mental illness! Many towns and cities still do not have a deep understanding of mental illness. Their methods of treatment still do not break away from the standards of the eighteenth century. They either seek gods and Buddhas, eat elixirs, or beat them violently to exorcise evil spirits and imprison them for life. I once saw with my own eyes in my hometown that a family of scholars for generations specially made wooden cages to imprison two generations of mental patients. What a tragic event this is! We can also see that people often spit at mental patients or throw stones at them, making all kinds of insulting gestures. Moreover, many families of patients believe that mental illness is shameful or that it is a misfortune for the family and damages their reputation. Therefore, they often secretly conceal it and do not give them a chance for treatment. But then again, this cannot be entirely blamed on the people. If one really wants to seek scientific treatment, one suffers from the lack of modern mental hospitals with complete equipment and scientific equipment. Not to mention remote towns and cities, even the limited number of beds in mental hospitals in Shanghai, a major city, how can all mental patients receive scientific gifts? In the public hospitals of advanced countries in Europe and the United States, the number of beds for mental patients often exceeds the total number of beds for other diseases.

Mental patients are unfortunate enough to have this painful disease, which is no different from other physical diseases. A person who has typhoid fever can do a career after a full recovery. Why can't a mental patient do a great and magnificent career after recovery? Mr. Beers is a perfect example. Both are "diseases," so what is there to be ashamed of or despise? On the contrary, we should give mental patients great sympathy. The facts tell us that mental illness is no longer as mysterious or terminal as previously imagined. In the progress of modern science, there is already a great hope of being cured. I hope that the families of mental patients will no longer be obsessed with superstition or imprison or discriminate against them, and should send them to scientific mental hospitals for treatment. I also hope that health authorities and people from all walks of life deeply feel the pain of "having a disease but nowhere to treat it" and universally establish modern mental hospitals. This is truly the greatest charitable cause and a necessary step to promote mental health work.

### The War Between Humans and Germs! (Continued to the End)

— Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management" by Qiao Shumin

Enhancing Resistance

Next, let's talk about resisting infection by invading germs—if the germs actually penetrate the mucous membrane or skin and enter the body, the defense of the reticuloendothelial system is very important. How the activity of phagocytic cells is sufficient to determine whether or not an infection is established. Unfortunately, we also do not know how to enhance this type of phagocytic activity. Generally speaking, the establishment of acute infection is largely due to the number and virulence of invading germs; while the establishment of chronic infection is mostly closely related to nutritional status. The so-called good nutrition not only refers to the appropriate preparation of food, but especially refers to the coordination of various factors (such as fatigue, exercise, air, sunlight, etc.) that affect metabolism.

According to the recent research of Soviet scientist Bogomolets, injecting a small amount of anti-reticular cytotoxic serum can enhance the phagocytic activity of reticular cells.

(10) Generation of Special Resistance – Vaccination

The use of vaccination to generate special resistance is truly the greatest invention and contribution of modern humans. We are not yet able to prevent all infectious diseases with vaccines. The effectiveness of each vaccination is also often not completely reliable or lasting. Everything is still in continuous research and progress. The practical vaccination methods can be classified as follows:

B Active Immunization - Using vaccines to stimulate immunity.

A. Using weakened live germs as vaccines:

(1) Vaccinia Virus – Vaccination to prevent smallpox.

(2) Tick-borne disease prevention vaccine.

(3) Yellow fever prevention vaccine.

(4) Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)

B. Using killed germs as vaccines:

(1) Typhoid prevention vaccine (should be made from strains containing V1 antigen)

(2) Cholera prevention vaccine.

(3) Plague prevention vaccine.

(4) Pneumonia prevention vaccine.

(5) Tetanus prevention vaccine.

(6) Pertussis prevention vaccine.

A. Using bacterial toxins or antigens as vaccines.

(1) Diphtheria prevention vaccine – Toxin, toxoid, alum-precipitated toxoid.

(2) Scarlet fever prevention vaccine.

2. Passive Immunization – Using serum containing antibodies, injected into the human body, can immediately produce short-term immunity, but it disappears quickly in the body. Therefore, it is only suitable for temporary use in people who already have an infection or are at risk of infection.

A. Using animal serum:

(1) Anti-diphtheria serum.

(2) Anti-scarlet fever serum.

(3) Anti-tetanus serum.

B. Using serum from recovered patients:

(1) Serum from people who have had measles.

(2) Serum from people who have had chickenpox.

(3) Convalescent pertussis serum.

(4) Convalescent mumps serum.

(5) Convalescent poliomyelitis serum

C. Mixed Active and Passive Immunization - For example, the injection of a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin, or the late injection of serum from patients who have recovered from measles.

Vaccination is very effective in preventing and controlling the epidemic of certain infectious diseases. When a certain infectious disease occurs, if susceptible contacts are all vaccinated and obtain immunity, the epidemic will not occur. Even if not all can be vaccinated, as long as half of them receive it, the effect of preventing the occurrence of epidemics is also very considerable. The ten items on the right are the general steps for managing infectious diseases, which are the only way to win against germs. How to use it flexibly depends on the person and also varies with the nature of the disease.

Spring and Autumn

### My Understanding of Zhang Daqian

— Lu Danlin

It has been seven years since I last saw Daqian. This time, Daqian came to Shanghai from Chengdu, and we met for the first time. His opening words stunned me. "Yes, in the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Daqian was in Hong Kong, about to return to Sichuan. He was with my brother Xiao Dan, both guests in Hong Kong. The next day, I would also depart for Guilin, alone. We agreed to meet again between the Sword Pavilion and Mount Qingcheng, to laugh together over this painting."

Later, they indeed met again in Sichuan. In the summer of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), Daqian sent his nephews, students, and disciples to hold a large-scale exhibition of copies of the Dunhuang murals in Chongqing. After the event, my family and they took a car to Chengdu, but I alone remained in Chongqing and did not go to Chengdu. Hence, Daqian's question was justified. To be honest, during my years in Chongqing, I worked successively at the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and the Wartime Transportation Administration of the Military Affairs Commission. It would have been very convenient to take a car to Chengdu if I had wanted to, but I didn't want to travel without a special reason. Therefore, for three years in Sichuan, I merely resided in a corner of the mountain city.

Last autumn, in September, I returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. Many friends saw me, and although I hadn't met with Daqian, news was frequently exchanged, and many friends traveled back and forth, so I knew a lot. Furthermore, Daqian went to Hong Kong twice after the war, and we met almost every day, so I can say a few things about him.

This time, Daqian's arrival in Shanghai has led some publications to spread untrue news, out of ignorance. Some say he painted dozens of tigers, others say he brought two or three wives, and some say his life is very difficult. These are all fabrications, made by people who don't know Daqian at all. Daqian never paints tigers; the one who paints tigers is his second brother, Shanzhi, who passed away in the 29th year of the Republic (1940). This time, Daqian came to Shanghai alone; his family is still in Chengdu. To say his life is difficult is even more contrary to the truth. Although Shen Yinmo once jokingly said Daqian was "rich enough to rival a nation, yet poor enough to have no place to stand," this is another aspect of the matter and certainly doesn't refer to Daqian's lifestyle. Because for over forty years, Daqian has never put money in his heart. Since some people in society don't understand Daqian, I, standing on the basis of a twenty-year friendship, will talk about Daqian, perhaps without much misunderstanding.

Daqian is a man of extraordinary talent, with unparalleled intelligence. He is not only skilled in calligraphy and painting, but also in poetry and lyrics, and in seal carving. He is truly versatile. He is fond of lavish spending. If he likes something, he will spend a thousand gold coins without hesitation. Sometimes he may not have a penny on him, but if he encounters a famous painting, even if it is worth a high price, he will first secure it and then find a way to raise the funds for the transaction. Therefore, the famous paintings he has acquired over the years are abundant and exquisite. Dealers, knowing his expertise in authentication and his generosity in offering high prices, often send him famous paintings for appreciation and purchase first. The many masterpieces in the Dafengtang collection came about in this way.

He is also very particular about food, especially Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine. He is skilled in cooking, and whenever distinguished guests arrive, he often goes into the kitchen to personally prepare dishes for them. (Jiang Yiyun wrote in the second poem of my scroll of Daqian's painting of Zhao Yaosheng: "Zhang with the beautiful beard has a great reputation, after returning from Dunhuang, his brush is even more outstanding; unforgettable is the night of listening to the rain in Xiao Qi, he personally cooks the river fish." This also refers to him personally preparing dishes.) He likes to eat ice cream, and year-round, he can eat many cups at a time. Ten years ago, he often spent more than a dollar on ice cream, and paid three dollars for the taxi fare, without caring at all. He doesn't smoke or drink normally, but when he meets good friends for a good conversation, he can drink several pounds of wine bowl after bowl without showing any signs of intoxication. When traveling, he always chooses first-class accommodations on ships, trains, and hotels. His clothes are plain, and he wears cloth socks all year round, but his enjoyment is extremely luxurious. He always tries his best to help relatives and friends in urgent need. If he is short of money, he will immediately write a calligraphy piece and have someone exchange it for cash. Sometimes, to help a friend who needs a loan urgently, or for a larger sum, he will pawn a few of his collected masterpieces to get money for his friend. This kind of willingness to help others in their time of need is very rare.

He canceled his painting price list more than ten years ago. Usually, when outsiders ask him to paint, if there is no special relationship, he often refuses to paint, even if a generous fee is offered. Even if someone introduces them, it is common for the request to be put aside for a year or two. However, when he is in a good mood, he can often complete several paintings in one go within just a few hours. Especially at gatherings with happy guests, with wine flowing freely, he would talk and write, painting landscapes, flowers, birds, figures, and characters as the mood strikes him, painting and inscribing as he goes, truly embodying the spirit of "hands waving five fingers, eyes following flying geese." If you are his good friend, you can find opportunities to ask him to paint at any time, and he will not refuse. And the paintings he gives to friends are mostly masterpieces. Among his former friends, the first to be mentioned is the late Cen Yucen. The scrolls, fans, and albums I have of his paintings add up to dozens. Unfortunately, some of them were lost due to the war in Shanghai and Hong Kong. He often said, "The most precious thing in life is friendship, especially with friends who appreciate my works. What is money worth? If money were precious, I could now be a millionaire with countless riches." Yes, the amount of money that has passed through his hands is truly immeasurable.

The actions of Daqian, the man with the beautiful beard, are very genuine and unrestrained, and also very humorous. He was originally a Christian, but in his youth, due to a love entanglement, he became a monk at the Songjiang Chanding Temple for a few months. He still uses "Daqian Jushi" (Daqian Lay Buddhist) to sign his works. He loves to travel. Once the idea strikes him, he thinks of the grandeur of nature, intimately engaging with the scenery and accumulating inspiration. He also possesses a wealth of artistic talent bestowed by nature. Combined with continuous hard work, he has been able to achieve his current accomplishments. In his Dafengtang studio, he treasures over a thousand pieces of famous paintings from past dynasties, broadly surveying the works of various masters, without adhering to any particular style or school, and diligently studying all of them. In particular, he has grasped the secrets of Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Shi Xi, Jianjiang, Dafeng, Dong Xin, and Xin Luo, integrating and synthesizing them, extracting the essence of the ancients and discarding their dross. Every stroke is conceived before it is executed, and the spirit merges with the ancients. His brushwork is unrestrained and vigorous, with a rich, thick, and moist style, melting together the Northern and Southern schools in one furnace, creating his own unique path. This is reaching the pinnacle of artistic transformation, without any trace of constraint. Furthermore, for the past twenty years, he has traveled to famous mountains and rivers both domestically and abroad... Wherever his footsteps have taken him, he has sought out the true charm of wind and rain in remote mountain valleys, on precipitous cliffs, in ancient temples with tall pines, adopting the scenery of nature to use as material for his paintings. As Shi Tao said, "Search exhaustively for strange peaks to make drafts." Therefore, his paintings, in all aspects of layout and color, are ingenious and unique, directly taking nature as his teacher, writing out the cosmic realm in his heart. As Yun Nantian said in his postscript to the Ouxiangguan paintings, "Every blade of grass, every tree, every hill, every ravine, is uniquely opened up by spiritual imagination."...

Daqian's skill in copying ancient paintings is truly ghostly in its accuracy. His copies of Qing Teng, Bai Yang, Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Shi Xi, Lao Yun, Dong Xin, and Xin Luo are indeed indistinguishable from the originals. Especially his imitations of Shi Tao are the most famous. Not only are the brushwork, spirit, and charm of the paintings identical to Shi Tao's genuine works, but the inscriptions, seals, inkpads, and paper quality are also meticulously replicated, seamless and flawless. However, he treats it as a playful exercise, and in front of friends, he never conceals it. Yet, art dealers and collectors who love antiquity, upon acquiring a slightly refined Shi Tao painting, cannot help but wonder if "this was made by Daqian." Indeed, Daqian's works in the style of Shi Tao have spread throughout the world, confounding foreign collectors. Originally, using fakes to deceive the real is a cunning trick of artists, and it can also be used for amusement in conversations among friends, which is not to be taken as a lesson. However, to learn Chinese painting, one must first copy the ancients, and to copy the ancients, one must strive for accurate and subtle likenesses that can deceive the eye. This is an indispensable stage in learning to paint and cannot be ignored, as it is said, "Reviewing the old allows one to understand the new." However, in recent years, Daqian's style has changed. Those former works imitating ancient paintings are merely an indelible page in his life's journey, a game in the world.

How did Daqian's painting style change? It was during his long journey to Dunhuang, where, in the confluence of Chinese and foreign art, he immersed himself in painting for several years. This transformation led his style to shift from Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Shi Xi, and Lao Yun to the art of the Six Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty. This kind of sublime and magnificent painting truly proclaims his fame in the desert and paints the world in glorious colors. In the history of Chinese painting, besides Daqian, there has not been a second person to date. Because even if someone has his ambition, they may not have his ability, and even if they have his ambition and ability, they may not have his genius and thought to integrate and apply them. Therefore, Daqian's uniqueness cannot but be said to make him a special figure in the contemporary art world.

A few days ago, I talked with Ye Xiaweng (Gongchuo) about Daqian's paintings. Xiaweng said, "Daqian should focus on figure painting in the future, because there are no figure painters in the contemporary era. And figure painting is originally the most important in Chinese painting. Daqian has the genius for painting and profound attainments, and having lived in Dunhuang for many years, he should give full play to his strengths, bring a unique brilliance to the modern Chinese art scene, and continue its glorious history." Xiaweng knows Daqian very well, and these words are indeed a fair assessment. I share this opinion and write it down specifically as the conclusion to this article.

### Zhang Daqian in Modern Painting History

— Zheng Wuchang

According to the method of having no method, the method of having no method is established by myself, the method of having method is obtained by myself, obtaining the method of others and using it for my own purposes, establishing my own method so that others cannot reach it, then there is nowhere that I cannot go, and there is nothing that I cannot do well, this is a master. In the past, painting philosophers such as Gu, Lu, Cao, Wu, Jing, Guan, Dong, Ju, Liu, Li, Mi, Guo, Ma, Xia, Huang, Wang, Ni, Wu, Wen, Shen, Tang, Dong, and also Bada Shanren, Shi Tao, recommended as masters of their generation, all obtained the methods of others and established their own methods, exhausted the changes of man and nature, and made pioneering and succeeding contributions. Since the Four Wangs crowned the painting garden in the Qing Dynasty, scholars have flocked under their prestigious names; or those who create new styles are often regarded as strange. For hundreds of years, there have been many who copied, and few who created. There are those who practiced the method of a certain school and called themselves superior; but there are very few who collected the methods of others and made themselves a family. Brother Daqian the Eighth has embraced the ambition of surpassing the ancients, and has the talent of surpassing the world, disdaining to follow the customs of likes and dislikes. He initially carried forward and greatly expanded the style of Bada Shanren and Shi Tao, which historians regarded as strange, shaking the recent painting world; he opened a new face in the corrupt and decadent customs. Then he collected the methods of the great masters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties to write about the natural scenery wherever his travels led him, magnificent and majestic, to show my method. Recently, in addition to silk, he traced the source of painting, spending years of hard work, traveling to the remote borders, and searching and copying the murals in the Dunhuang caves; he was familiar with the methods of material selection, composition, brushwork, and coloring of the painters of the Six Dynasties and the Sui and Tang Dynasties, obtained them in his hand, understood them in his heart, followed the ancients, and innovated in the present, so his works flashed with the high antiquity of the past. Daqian himself said, "Sitting in the courtyard of the Six Dynasties, entering the hall of the Sui and Tang Dynasties." With this ambition, with this courage, and with this skill, there may be no second person in hundreds of years. It is truly no exaggeration to place him in the ranks of the ancient masters. Recently, Daqian exhibited his recent works at the Chinese Painting Academy, with more than eighty landscape, figure, flower, and bird paintings. I wonder if those who know will use my words to question him, what do you think?

### Autumn·Lyrical

— Hu Yingdong

Autumn is the season of prose, but facing this city filled with poisonous mist, I have long lost this prose mood.

Life has gnawed away at my heart, and every day, when I dissect myself from the mechanical and monotonous lifestyle, I always return with a wounded and weary heart.

Humanity is submerged, youth is sold off cheaply, there is no freedom of will, no heartfelt laughter, strangeness and hypocrisy swirl around me, and autumn, with a mocking silence, has crept close to my side.

I loathe it, I want to leave here, to rush to the countryside, to stand proudly on a hill, to roar at the clouds and sky, to open my heart and sing aloud, not allowing even a speck of dust to stain my soul, nor allowing demons to dance before my eyes.

When real life knocks on my head, I know how far away this realm is from me.

Autumn, the autumn here is a velvet fashion on a fashionable lady, the seductive smile of a goddess on a street corner, the overflowing aroma of roasted chestnuts from Liangxiang,

Besides that, besides that, I can't find anything else.

In the autumn wind, I see forced smiles hanging on people's lips, nestling for love beside gold bars, burning in people's bodies. People are just like that. From here, I unearth the emotions of twentieth-century humanity.

Autumn, how profound you are, how worldly-wise, but I have already determined that your fate will be a deathly silent winter, a petrified mummy!?

### Plum Bamboo

— Zhang Daqian

### In Praise of the Daqian Lay Buddhist

— Xu Shiqi

The Daqian Lay Buddhist has traveled widely within the universe, visiting famous mountains and writing prolifically, a treasure to the art world. During the War of Resistance, he settled in Chengdu (the people of Sichuan return to Sichuan, not "Chongqing people"). He once traveled far to Qinghai, exploring the beauty of Dunhuang, and painted murals that are magnificent and exquisite, aiming to restore the legacy of the Tang Dynasty and promote the spirit of the Renaissance in Eastern art, a truly heroic undertaking.

The other day, I visited with Brother Hufan, and it was very lively, with Zu Han, Jekan, Zhiliu, and others engaging in lively discussions. Daqian said that in recent years, prices have skyrocketed, and the income from a painting is not enough to cover the cost of a feast, so he plans to change his profession to become a chef, showcasing his skills. A guest suggested that he could open a Dunhuang restaurant in Shanghai, selling Buddha's Foot Ice Cream. (In the Dunhuang grottoes, it is extremely cold under the feet of the Buddha statues, and water drips and freezes into ice. Daqian loves to indulge in ice cream, consuming four or five cups at a time.) Daqian was already thinking of this twenty years ago, and today his style is still the same as before, truly a black-haired old man pretending to be young.

He traveled widely to the borderlands, and the magnificent rivers and mountains are collected in his paintings;

For years, he painted murals in the Dunhuang caves, and returning to Jiangnan, his hair is not yet white.

### One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood 100

— Ye Jingfeng

Therefore, Tsurumi Michitoki not only didn't want to joke around with these desperate men, but also took special care and caution; although he didn't run away, he temporarily forgot the fatigue of the past two days, secretly quickened his pace, and prepared to seize an opportunity to execute a golden cicada shedding its skin, to avoid this trouble. Who knew that as Tsurumi quickened his pace here, the six men chasing after him got even closer.

Seeing that the situation was not right, Tsurumi loosened his tie and unbuttoned a few buttons on his vest, muttering to himself, "I didn't expect to get so hot just walking a few steps." As he spoke, he suddenly took off the tightly wrapped tuxedo and draped it over his wrist. All these preparations were to avoid being restrained by these clothes when it came to fighting.

The "dang mi chan" who was preparing to fight the enemy looked ahead and caught sight of a Western-style bar a few dozen steps away, still brightly lit. Knowing that it was still open after the Ginza and theater crowds had dispersed, he suddenly had an idea. He immediately slowed down and buttoned up his buttons and tie as he walked, leaving only the tuxedo draped over his wrist. When he reached a few steps from the bar, he stopped, first measuring the lights and signs of the bar, as if he wanted to record the location, and then looked at the opposite street and both ends. In fact, he wanted to see how the guys following him would act. Little did he know that as soon as he turned around, he saw that the road was deserted, with only the slightly swaying shadows of trees and telephone poles, and not even a ghost in sight.

Tsurumi knew that the guys following him had anticipated that he would go to the bar, so they had hidden in advance. Tsurumi thought, "Well, it's good to rest in this bar for a while, and see how things go after I recover some strength." Thinking this, he put on his tuxedo again.

Although this bar didn't look special on the outside, as soon as you stepped on the stairs, you knew it was a gorgeous and thoroughly Western-style lounge dance hall. There was no fancy decoration on the outside, only the two words "New Green" were embedded artistically on the lintel. Tsurumi first rearranged his tuxedo and tie, and the guard at the door bowed and opened the door a crack. Because there was air-conditioning, people were waiting to greet guests all the way through the triple doors.

Tsurumi left his hat and didn't take a seat, but first went to make a phone call, calling the "Eikawa" inn where he was staying to send someone to Ueno Park to pick up his car. After leaving the phone booth, he told the usher who was waiting that he wanted to find a comfortable seat without having to have someone accompany him for drinks and dances; Japanese people only rest. He also told him to notify the door that if his car came, the driver should come to the hall to let him know.

This lounge dance hall was a beautiful and magnificent scene; the lighting, decoration, seats, and dance floor were arranged very beautifully, and the colors were harmonious. Even after midnight, the male and female customers were still quite crowded. At this time, the music station was playing the popular Western-style music made in Japan, "Maiden's Spring." Couples were already gathering in twos and threes on the dance floor, following the music and taking tango steps. Apart from the light and slow playing of the music, there wasn't even the sound of coughing. The Japanese had mastered the "quiet" mantra very successfully, which was also rare.

Tsurumi had been out of touch with the social life of Tokyo for five or six years, so at this time, seeing everything in this lounge, he was surprised at the speed of progress, but also felt very uneasy, because in his mind, he was still continuously seeing the various war reports from the Changxindian radio station, the Japanese soldiers rushing and breaking into the area of Beiping, the roaring of Japanese artillery, and the compatriots in the Northeast who had been trampled under the feet of the Japanese for several years, planning to slaughter and plunder China, and so on. But here in Tokyo, the origin of all the atrocities, it was so quiet, with melodious songs and graceful dances, as peaceful as the moon palace. The soldiers who had not yet been sent to the front, and some bureaucrats, politicians, gentlemen, ladies, and socialites, all had quiet smiles on their faces, as if there was no such thing as aggression and slaughter in the world.

### Mad Love

— Shaofu

Recently, our city screened "Mad Love," starring Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde. The English original title of this film is "Leave Her to Heaven." Many friends who have seen it say it's good. The reason it is good is that it fully depicts a woman's psychology of intense love for a man, developed to the extreme, and resulting in a love state.

Some men feel overwhelmed by the complete possessiveness of their wives and cannot stand it, even though they deeply understand the other party's love and are moved by it. However, in the real world (not the Garden of Eden of Adam and Eve), how can a man give all his time and all his mind to his wife? Even if he is willing, it is actually difficult to do.

Therefore, men who encounter this situation—unable to accept the kindness—may suffer as much as the women who offer it but are denied.

Regardless of gender, a person always has a "corner of their soul." This corner, besides oneself, even if two people are together day and night, step by step, the concepts formed in their respective conscious domains in response to the outside world are not necessarily connected, not necessarily able to face each other completely naked. This is also a kind of tragedy in humanity. Therefore, mutual possession between the sexes ultimately has its limits.

### Overwhelmed by the Feelings of Past and Present · New York City Has Declined

— Erjun

An old New Yorker, Mr. Walker, a famous journalist, recently published an article in the newspaper, stating that life in New York is not as good as before, making him tired of it, and he wants to leave New York and go to a quiet place with beautiful mountains and rivers to enjoy the remaining years of his life.

The first thing that makes him feel headache is that the items and amounts of donations and taxes are increasing. The finances of New York City have long been a troublesome problem, and now it is getting worse and worse, almost to the point of exhaustion and unsolvable. The new mayor, Mr. O'Dwyer, although a famous administrator, has to plan for a new source of funds of 80 million US dollars as soon as he takes office. From a purely external point of view, the city is simply suffocating and making it impossible to breathe. The tunnels are overcrowded and have been around for a long time, and they also need to be repaired and cleaned. The bus system is gradually deteriorating; the service of business cars does not seem to be as convenient as before. Street traffic is getting worse and worse, and the problem of parking is simply unsolvable; although the city authorities have stipulated many rules for adjusting traffic, they are of little help in fact. These municipal affairs all need money to handle, so as soon as the new mayor takes office, he is immediately busy with ways to increase revenue, and as a result, the tax burden on citizens is increased.

Because the cost of living in New York City is high, her many industries cannot compete with the industries in cities with lower costs of living. Now the real seat of financial power is in Washington. Although the city authorities want to turn New York City into the "fashion center" of the world, the fashion industry is no longer what it used to be and has moved to California and even Texas.

It is not easy to live here. The housing shortage is also an urgent problem, and this problem cannot be improved in the short term. The crime rate is increasing day by day, and walking on the streets at night is not as peaceful as it used to be. Life is getting more and more complicated; strikes, strikes, are heard every day, making residents uneasy and unable to live in peace. According to some experts, given the current trend of increasingly advanced air transport, New York City may soon fall behind Chicago and no longer be the largest city in the United States.

As for entertainment and culture, the situation is also much worse than before. Although on the surface it is still as lively as ever, the essence has changed. Apart from some pornographic entertainment, the places of elegant recreation are decreasing day by day. People's attitudes, their dealings with others, have also changed. The enthusiasm and friendliness of the past, like the spirit of a family, have now disappeared without a trace. Now people all have cold faces, and apart from talking business and thinking of ways to earn other people's money, there is no friendship or sympathy. If there is, it is only hypocrisy.

Tragicomedy. No matter what the trend will be tomorrow, this is a definite fact, and this fact has been around for a long time and has not been changed by the war, that is, New York City has become a place that is not easy to live and work in. Coming to this city for travel, you cannot enjoy any comfort. Her spirit, her personality, and her important feelings have been declining day by day, especially in the last ten years or so. The face of life that New York City presents is just a tragicomic farce.

Tired of it. Mr. Walker came to New York City in 1919 and lived there. He is willing to go to a quiet place to raise some white-faced cattle, red-haired pigs, and black sheep, grow sweet potatoes and peppers, chop wood, and read old novels under the lamp in the evening, and listen to classical music (broadcast on the radio) in the blue sky. He doesn't want to talk much unless he finds someone who understands him. And the thing he cherishes most is being able to enjoy the freedom in life.

Why not return home? I have lived in Shanghai for almost twenty years and I am also tired of life in Shanghai. I long for the life in my hometown, where there is the distant view of Mount Lu and the tranquility of Gan Tang Lake. People who live in Shanghai! In this city full of dust, expensive goods, and housing panic, what is worth lingering in Shanghai? Your fields will be overgrown with weeds, why not return home?

### Following Others' Cries

— Wen

Mr. Zhu Jingnong attended a volunteer spiritual retreat organized by the YMCA the other day and delivered a speech titled "Psychological Construction of China." He said with deep sorrow, "The worst flaw in the Chinese character is 'blind obedience,' which is also 'parrot fashion.'" He further cited an example, saying that recently there have been calls for the withdrawal of American troops from China. However, there are only over three thousand American soldiers in China, and these three thousand are not even concentrated in one place. Meanwhile, a certain country's troops in Dalian alone exceed fifteen thousand. Is it possible that these scattered three thousand are more harmful than the fifteen thousand concentrated in one place? Why is it that people are only clamoring for the withdrawal of American troops while no one is clamoring for a certain country's troops to withdraw from China?"

After listening to Mr. Zhu's words, I can't help but advise those impassioned friends that, regardless of whether they support foreign troops staying or leaving, it is best to make their own decisions. Following others' cries is no different from belittling oneself! Besides, "others" have their own calculations!

### Tram Transformation into Train

— Yu

Shanghai's trams have already "transformed into trains." If you don't believe me, please see the reasons below:

1. We often see that no trams come for a long time, and then, after one comes, there are a dozen or so linked together. This is "train-like" in form.

2. Some trams don't stop at some stations and do stop at others; these are "special express trains."

3. Some trams don't stop at any station after they start; these are "direct trains."

4. There are also Route 2 trams that switch to Route 1 signs midway on their return trip; these are "local trains."

5. Some terminal stations don't pick up passengers, and only pick them up at the station one or two stops after the terminal; this is like "boarding at the West Station."

### Anonymous

Often, there are people who donate money but do not wish to seek empty fame, and therefore cannot be named, so they are called "Anonymous."

In the 30th year of the Republic [1941], a 26-year-old young writer wrote a book called "The Love of Lucia." After its publication, sales were poor, and he felt depressed and disappeared from the literary scene, immersing himself in arduous self-cultivation for two years. In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he wrote two novels in Xi'an with a tentative approach: "Arctic Scenery Sketches" and "The Woman in the Tower." Because the book he wrote two years ago did not sell well, he no longer dared to use his previous pen name, so he simply used "Anonymous" as his pen name. In his original intention, he felt that his literary attainment was not deep enough to reveal his true identity lightly. Unexpectedly, these two books became bestsellers in the rear area. Young readers in Xi'an, Chongqing, Kunming, Lanzhou, and other places all appreciated them. Thus, "Anonymous" became "Famous."

After the victory [end of WWII], Anonymous bid farewell to the readers in the rear area, and even a single piece of news could not be heard. Recently, suddenly discovered an author on a certain evening newspaper in this city, also named Anonymous. But according to what I know, Anonymous specifically said to the writer after finishing those two novels that he would no longer publish articles in newspapers. If you wanted to read his articles, it would have to be in book form. Sure enough, received a letter from Anonymous yesterday, saying that he is currently in Hangzhou, writing a long novel of 1.8 million characters, titled "Beasts! Beasts! Beasts!" Based on this, it can be known that this "Anonymous" is not that "Anonymous."

What interests me here is that the author of "Arctic Scenery Sketches" gained "fame" by using "Anonymous," which shows that the achievement of an article still lies in the article itself. As long as the article is good, Anonymous will also become Famous; conversely, if the article is not good, then "Famous" will also become truly Anonymous.

Also, although using the three characters "Anonymous" as a pen name is very clever, these three characters are very similar in nature to titles like "To Be Determined," and are often plagiarized (such as the Anonymous discovered in a certain evening newspaper). Therefore, Mr. Anonymous (referring to the author of "Arctic Scenery Sketches"), should he add an annotation after Anonymous, to completely reveal his true face?

Conscription, Hide-and-Seek, Too Absurd

Recently, many people from the countryside have fled to Shanghai because the government is conscripting soldiers. However, the average person from the countryside simply doesn't know what conscription means, only that it is called drawing strong men, and that being drawn means going to war, and war means death. So, they are fleeing and hiding, and buying substitutes is also often heard of, which is very harmful during this harvest season. Furthermore, some officials think that there is an opportunity to take advantage of this, so they stir up trouble, taking the opportunity to search and extort, giving themselves a big fattening up.

I think special efforts should be made in publicity work! It is also reported that there are so many unemployed or jobless vagrants in Shanghai, that the government not drawing them to train them is truly killing two birds with one stone.

Recently, on the streets, one can often see a jeep, with several police officers sitting inside, "cruising," catching vendors. The results are indeed satisfactory, with the vendors fleeing at the sight of the vehicle. But as soon as they leave, those vendors gather again from street corners, secluded alleys, or other places, and continue to do their business as usual. This situation is like playing hide-and-seek, truly amusing!

Ten-wheeled trucks have always been rushing and ramming in the city, displaying their power, and the common people have always been accustomed to being bullied. They swallow their anger and dare not say a word? Unexpectedly, not long ago, this "atomic tiger" launched its power on North Sichuan Road and crashed the mayor's car. Fortunately, Mayor Wu was "magnanimous" and said, "As long as he comes down and says hello, I won't ask him to pay." But the unappreciative military truck ran away, no wonder the mayor was angry and said he would investigate and deal with it severely, probably to give him a hard time, otherwise what is the use of investigating? The mayor also said, "This is too absurd, this is too disorderly." But the mayor may not know that it has long been too absurd, and long been too disorderly, but what can we common people do?

Who would have known that a drug addict must go through so much hardship and pain to swim out of the Black Sea? Here is the experience of a friend who has now broken his addiction:

Quitting smoking has three difficulties: first laziness, second thoughts, and third clearing out the residue. Laziness and thoughts are just feeling uncomfortable, as for clearing out the residue, that is really a matter of life and death. Because of economic reasons, I used the gradual reduction method of diluting Lin Shiba medicine wine. After a month, I finally succeeded, but my spirit was listless, and I had no interest in anything. Even if there were many gold bars and silver ingots piled up outside the door, just stooping down would give you them. However, I would rather miss this good opportunity and lie still, really not even the energy to raise my hand and move my feet! The laziness is evident.

Although nominally I quit, I still constantly think of this "gentleman" [opium], truly lingering. In dreams, if I could meet him again at that time, it would be easiest to renew old friendships.

Do you know what "clearing out the residue" is like? Strangely enough, after about four months, people said that I was fatter than before, and my family members were also convinced that I had completely broken my addiction. One day, I went to the street for the first time since quitting smoking. Passing by my old "opium den," I couldn't help but feel a great desire and, regardless of the months of hard work, ran in, eager to kiss "her fragrance." Many old friends offered endless hospitality. Ah! I really want to thank that senior "old hand" [opium smoker], who actually said to me: "I am old and have no way! You are young, and you have already broken free, why do you want to come again? Isn't this wasting all your hard work!" At that time, I had already loaded the pipe, ready to "import" [smoke], but hearing these words, my conscience was discovered, so I put down the opium pipe, took out the appropriate amount of currency, threw it on the kang [heated platform], considered it a meeting fee, and left without a word. Before I got home, I only felt dizzy, the sky spinning and the earth turning, a wave of nausea, vomited uncontrollably, and collapsed. I fainted, and when I woke up, I was already in my bed at home.

What do you think I vomited? It turned out to be a big pile of black, thick, sticky "old paste" scraped from an eagle's stomach! After this vomiting, the poison was finally cleared out, although I was sick for another month or so, but from then on, I broke off old relationships and never thought of longing again. Do you see this last hurdle, is it strange or not? Difficult or not?

Now, at a time when the clearing of opium poison is being repeatedly emphasized, I see that those who are deeply immersed in the Black Sea will all ascend to the path of light. I am writing this "experience talk" to provide readers with conversation aid!
