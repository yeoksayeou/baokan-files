### Three-Person Inspection Team Returns to Beijing Today; Truth of Situation in Central Hubei Will Soon Be Known; Commander-in-Chief He Says There Was No Conflict

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] It is rumored that Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai will return to Beijing on the 10th. According to General Gillon: the report of the Three-Person Group on the mediation of Central Hubei has not yet arrived in Beijing. It is not known whether Brigadier General Bairud will return from Hankou to Peiping or come to Beijing in the future. General Gillon is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 10th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] Reports indicate that the situation in northern Hubei is trending toward resolution. Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and Brigadier General Bairud, Director of the Executive Group of the Executive Headquarters, are expected to return here on the 10th to report to General Marshall and Chairman Chiang. According to authoritative sources: it is not difficult for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to reach an agreement, but the key difficulty lies in the Communist army's suggestion to move 60,000 troops from southern Hunan into Wuhu, Anhui, because this move contradicts the peace agreement. General Xu Yongchang demanded that the Communist army withdraw to the originally designated area. At the same time, Yan'an Radio announced that orders had been issued to cease military action.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] At the first press conference with foreign journalists since the return to the capital, when asked about the truth of the "Central Plains conflict" claimed by the Chinese Communist Party, Minister Wu replied: the National Army has not attacked the Communist army at all. However, the Communist army violated the ceasefire order and recently began to move its troops, attempting to attack the National Army. As for the truth, it will be known after the Three-Person Inspection Team, which went to inspect a few days ago, returns.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 9th] There are conflicts in Huang'an, Hubei Province, on the Hubei border in the eastern part of Henan Province, and Zhiwo, Henan Province.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Commander-in-Chief He responded to inquiries about the situation in the Central Plains conflict, stating: there is no conflict in the Central Plains at all. The Three-Person Team went to inspect. The so-called conflict that the Communist army is publicizing is feared to be another conspiracy. The Communist army, seeing that the National Army's strength in the east is weak, is greatly expanding eastward from its original station, seemingly trying to infiltrate the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. To prevent contingencies, the National Army had to send troops to guard. In fact, there was no conflict. The Communist army's Li Xiannian's unit was located south of Guangshan during the ceasefire. After the ceasefire, the Communist army's First Column infiltrated Hupihe Huguan, the Second Column infiltrated Dingyuan Dian, the 15th Brigade infiltrated Wangyang Dian, and the Li Xiannian's Central Plains Military Region Headquarters moved to Xuanhua Dian. The 13th Brigade infiltrated Panxing Dian and Pengxing Dian southwest of Luoshan, and the 14th Brigade infiltrated Se Gang Dian. Recently, the Communist army has been expanding its territory eastward. The First Communist Column moved towards Shangcheng and Huangchuan, infiltrating Zhaijiafan, Shijiawen, Shuangliuqiao, Guanyinpu, and Linjiaji. Its Second Column moved towards Huguan, Hupihe, and Wenshusi. Panxing Dian, Pengxing Dian, and Segang Dian still retain one regiment of the 13th Brigade, and Wangyang Dian still retains one regiment of the 15th Brigade. Subsequently, at the request of reporters, Commander-in-Chief He reported the general situation of the Communist army's violation of the ceasefire order. From 1:00 AM on January 14th to the end of April: (1) 393 attacks on the National Army, (2) 69 destructions of transportation, (3) 92 occupied cities and towns, (4) 33 looted materials, (5) one poison gas attack in Yanzhou, (6) 8 landmine placements.

### Communist Army Implements Road Destruction Policy Again; Situation in North China Tense; Executive Headquarters Has Become an "Observation Agency"

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 9th] The situation in North China has recently become visibly tense. Coupled with the problem of Northeast China and the "Central Plains Military Region," it is quite worrying. After a brief period of stability in North China during the inspection of Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall, it has become uneasy again due to the deterioration of the Northeast problem. Recent CCP propaganda publications here are also full of tense language. Analyzing the trends along its railway lines, it is clear that the ceasefire order and the agreement to restore traffic are no longer effective. When discussing these issues within the Military Mediation Department, it does not seem to pay much attention to who is responsible, but instead focuses on creating more complications. The Communist side even stated that if the situation develops in this way, the Communist army will intensify the destruction of transportation. In its statements, in addition to the complete cessation of road repair work on the Peiping-Hankou Railway from Yuanshi to Anyang, conflicts have also occurred between Anyang and Xinxiang, which have been peaceful for a long time, and preparations for war are very urgent. On the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, in addition to the fierce fighting in the Machang-Tangguantun area, the destruction of roads and conflicts can be counted all the way to Yanzhou. The Jiaoji Railway, starting with the conflict in Gaomi, has now spread to Weixian. The Longhai Railway has been partially destroyed again after a section was repaired but not opened to traffic. On the Peiping-Nanking Railway, in addition to occasional disturbances in the Peiping-Tianjin area and the night train has not yet departed, there are also occasional destructions between Tianjin and Yu. On the Yu-Jin section, 30,000 Communist troops are divided up to destroy roads, constantly interrupting and repairing them. From today, the Yu-Pan section will temporarily reopen to traffic. Official sources claim: the Communist army's recent actions are to implement a road destruction policy again in the name of preventing the government from transporting troops, and to take a threat of siege against cities. Communist army movements are frequent near Tangshan, and artillery fire can be heard in Shijiazhuang. This evening's evening newspaper here also reported that the Communist army near Peiping and Tianjin also has a tendency to encircle, and Communist army movements are frequent in various nearby areas.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th] Since the Northeast conflict became apparent, the situation in Shandong Province has deteriorated day by day. Communist troops in various places have continuously launched widespread offensives and destroyed transportation. The situation of the Communist troops' activities in Shandong Province in the past half month is briefly recorded as follows: Starting on the 25th of last month, more than 4,000 Communist troops in eastern Shandong suddenly launched a large-scale attack on the National Army and local security forces stationed in Zhangling and Dama Ridge. The National Army was caught off guard, Zhangling Village was captured, and Zhangling Station was reduced to ashes. In addition, the National Army stationed in Taishang, Jiaogao, and northeast of Gaomi were also violently attacked by the Communist army. National Army officers and soldiers suffered heavy casualties and are still heavily besieged. Cheng, Yucheng, Changqing and other places have been attacked by the Communist army. On the night of the 7th, more than 3,000 Communist troops divided into three routes to attack Wangsherenzhuang, the seat of Licheng County, 30 miles away from Jinan City. The sound of artillery fire was clearly audible in Jinan City. In addition, the relief flour and salt items transported to Liaocheng by the Executive Group a few days ago were detained by the Communist army. Thirty-two train cars fully loaded with coal on the Jiaoji Line were also completely detained by the local Communist army at the Dalinchi and Zaoyuansi stations on the way west starting on the 6th. Even the gasoline for the return of relief supplies from the Shandong-Qingdao Branch of the Relief Administration was illegally detained. As for transportation, in addition to strictly inspecting and detaining passengers, vehicles have recently been intercepted, and the permits issued by the Executive Group have also been torn up. Based on these signs, the Communist army's actions are becoming increasingly extreme, and the situation in Shandong Province is not optimistic.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th] The joint railway and automobile transportation between Jinan and Qingdao has been implemented for only six days. Now, due to the Communist army's unwarranted interception of vehicles and harassment of passengers, it has been forced to suspend operations.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 9th] After the Jinan Team went to various conflict sites to investigate, the Jinan Team and the Gaomi Team held a joint meeting on the train in Caijiazhuang on the 8th and established a coordination: (1) Both sides' troops should immediately cease conflict at their current positions, and the commanders should supervise their subordinates to effectively implement this. (2) Regarding the recent conflicts, the adjustment of each other's positions and the determination of the garrison will be reserved for consultation between the highest military commanders of both sides in Shandong. (3) The problem of restoring transportation will be solved by the railway management team.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] The Fengjiakou Station on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was just captured by the Communist army. Potou East Station, south of the station, was also captured by the Communist army on the night of the 8th. The whereabouts of all station staff are unknown. The Communist army also attacked Zhuanhe Station for a time, but was driven back.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 8th] The tracks between Daxujia and Yunhe stations on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway have recently been dismantled by the Communist army again.

[United Press, Peiping, 9th] Sources with good information in the Executive Headquarters told United Press reporters tonight: in the past 48 hours, the Eighth Route Army troops have cut the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway into several sections. These people believe that the Executive Headquarters here has become an "observation agency" without any ability to prevent the war.

### Personnel Receiving Three Cities in Nine Provinces of the Northeast Mostly Still Awaiting Orders; Living in Difficult Circumstances, Plan to Request Payment of Salaries and Allowances

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 9th] Except for the 20+ counties of Liaoning and the city of Shenyang, personnel from the other provinces and cities in the nine northeastern provinces and three cities are still awaiting orders in Peiping, Jinzhou, Shenyang, and other places. Considering an average of 70 people per province (section chiefs and secretaries and above), there are more than 700 people leading difficult and idle lives. Since October last year, they have been receiving a maintenance fee of 60,000 yuan per month on average. Recently, it has increased slightly, with a maximum of 99,000 yuan per person, and a minimum of 59,000 yuan. The chairman receives 119,000 yuan.

### Situation in Northern Jiangsu Tense; Communist Army Attacks Yangtai

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Commander-in-Chief He replied to reporters' questions at the Army Headquarters on the 9th, saying: regarding the actual situation of the conflict in northern Jiangsu, starting from April 26th, the Communist side violated the ceasefire agreement and dispatched five regiments of troops. First, they disturbed Bao Ying, then attacked Jieshou, and attacked Shiguangzhen, Xiaohaizhen, Xingrenzhen, and Guanyinshanzhen, which belong to Nantong County, and planned to attack Nantong County. A part of them went to Haimen. The National Army did not counterattack because it恪遵恪遵 the ceasefire order. Later, because the matter was serious and the people were panicked all day long, they gradually recovered Xiaohe, Guanyinshan, and Xingrenzhen to relieve the suffering. The Communist army then retreated to Sanyangzhen in Haimen. On the evening of May 3rd, the Communist army attacked Baipu again. It is clear that its purpose is to occupy Nantong in order to achieve its own goals. Recently, there have been signs of attacking Taixian and Yangzhou, and its intention is to threaten Nanjing and Shanghai. He also said that the authority of the Ministry of National Defense is equivalent to that of the Military Affairs Commission. Under the minister is the Chief of Staff, who is under the command of the chairman in terms of orders, and the minister of national defense in terms of policies. The military will be detached and impartial in the future.

[Further Telegram] Commander-in-Chief He answered reporters' questions at the Army Headquarters press conference today as follows:

Question: Can Commander-in-Chief give a general description of the general situation of the military in the Northeast?

Answer: According to the troop reorganization plan, the ratio of the National Army to the Communist Army in the Northeast was originally five to one, but the current comparison between the National Army and the Communist Army is a ratio of more than two to one. The front line of the National Army has only reached south of Gongzhuling and north of　ban　.

Question: Can Commander-in-Chief give some comments on the recent situation of the United Nations Chiefs of Staff Meeting?

Answer: The meeting is currently in the secret meeting stage. Recently, what is being discussed is the organization of the international guard force.

Question: Can Commander-in-Chief explain the upcoming Ministry of National Defense?

Answer: The future Ministry of National Defense will be formed by merging the existing Military Affairs Department, Military Orders Department, Military Training Department, Logistics Department, Political Department, and General Staff Headquarters under the Military Affairs Commission. It will be directly subordinate to the Executive Yuan. Under the Minister, there will be a Chief of Staff, and four general superintendents (or commanders) of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics. Troop training work may be cancelled, but the Ministry of National Defense will be responsible for the important task of military administration. Military command is the responsibility of the Chief of Staff, and the supreme commander belongs to the head of state.

Question: When will the Ministry of National Defense be established? It is rumored that the Commander-in-Chief will be appointed as the Minister of National Defense. Is this news true?

Answer: The Minister of National Defense may still need to be a military officer for the time being, but in the future, it should be changed to a civilian. I have no plans to be the Minister of National Defense, but I very much hope that the ministry can be formally established on the first of next month, so that the Army Headquarters can complete the handover and I can temporarily rest. At this point, Mr. He also said: I have been the Minister of Military Administration for 14 years and the Chief of Staff for 8 years. I am exhausted and would like to rest.

Question: What is the recent progress of the withdrawal of the National Army in northern Vietnam?

Answer: There is currently one corps that has not yet withdrawn. Once the transportation of supplies stored in Vietnam is completed, they can all return to the country.

Question: When will my country send troops to Japan to occupy the country, and what will the number be?

Answer: The vanguard troops will depart this month, and the main force will depart next month. The number of occupying troops is one division and its necessary assigned troops.

Question: What is the Commander-in-Chief's opinion on the Female Youth Army?

Answer: Very good. However, the 1,000+ female youth soldiers who were conscripted during the war have all been discharged. I believe that for future service of female youths in the army, it is most appropriate to be assigned to medical, telecommunications and other departments.

Chiang Kai-shek Holds Tea Party to Entertain National Assembly Representatives Arriving in Beijing

### A Fierce Battle in Changchun: The City Government Reduced to Ashes, Mayor Zhao Junmai Imprisoned by the Communist Army

[Report from this newspaper's Shenyang bureau, dated the 8th] A fierce battle in Changchun, lasting five days from the 14th to the 18th of last month, saw the sounds of gunfire and cannons ceaselessly shaking the entire city day and night. The Communist forces advanced step by step, while the security teams never managed to retake the lost strongholds. The residence of us eight Chinese and American reporters, formerly the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, was also caught in the crossfire. Bullets shattered the glass, passing through the rooms, forcing us to move to the basement. On the 17th afternoon, one reporter went to the Central Bank to send out news, as it was the location of the defense headquarters and the Communist army's final target. Because he arrived ten minutes late, returning to his residence he found the roads blocked by gunfire. He remained inside until the battle ended. At 9 PM, the defending troops broke through and escaped. He remained inside the bank and was captured by the Communist army. He was searched six times, losing his pen, watch, shirt, and 5,000 yuan in circulating currency. Despite declaring his identity, it was to no avail. He was detained until 1 PM the next day and then released. Commander Chen Jiazhen and others were captured. Chen was shot in the leg, the entire leg swelling up. It took a week before he could be sent to the hospital for treatment. This was according to Lu Zhengcao of the Communist Party's Central Committee. The government's steps in response to the Soviet withdrawal were clearly very slow. Changchun's position was absolutely isolated. Although the Communist army had gathered troops outside Changchun, the siege force used only numbered three or four thousand men. Changchun is a city no smaller than Washington, and the buildings are exceptionally sturdy. For example, although the Central Bank was subjected to heavy bombing, no bullet could penetrate the walls, except for those that shattered the glass, entered the rooms, and exploded. The final attack on the city government used incendiary bombs, reducing the city government to ashes. The battle ended in a blazing inferno. If the Central Army had had even a division of troops, it could have ensured Changchun's safety. The city center square was an excellent aerial supply point. Although the air force flew in four times during the last two days to drop ammunition, the Communist army had already approached the core, and only a quarter of the supplies were received. The security team was surrounded, making it difficult to provide relief and morale was lost. Chen Jiazhen told reporters that Chief Zeng of the New First Army had crossed Sipingjie on the 15th. As of the time we reporters left, the New First Army was still south of Sipingjie. The Communist army announced that they had occupied Changchun on the 19th. The roofs of the residences of the Chinese and American reporters flew both the Chinese and American flags, and on the 17th, the Communist army began to protect them. On the 20th, the eight of us remained in our residence all day, and there were still sounds of gunfire and cannons in the city. On the 21st, when the reporters tried to go out to inspect, as soon as we opened the door, Communist soldiers pointed rifles at our chests and forced us back, realizing that we had lost our freedom. We then negotiated with Zhou Baozhong, the Communist army's garrison commander. Zhou replied that this was to protect our safety and admitted that the soldiers' actions were reckless. A written statement was drawn up for us to voluntarily sign, absolving the Communist army of responsibility for our safety, but it was ineffective. On May 1st, the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party moved from Jilin to Changchun. Peng Zhen, the secretary of the bureau, and Kai Feng, the propaganda minister, met with us reporters. According to Kai Feng's explanation, the Northeast Bureau instructed Changchun to absolutely ensure our safety, and they did not know that this would result in a loss of freedom, admitting that the execution of the order was too mechanical. After this, we were able to go out freely, each time accompanied by Liu Ke, the secretary of the garrison headquarters, and with armed protection. The Communist army leaders we met in Changchun included Peng Zhen, Lu Zhengcao, Zhou Baozhong, Zhang Xueshi, and Kai Feng. Lin Biao was on the front lines in Sipingjie. There were two reasons given for this attack on Changchun: (1) The National Army had attacked them in He'an, Panshan, Fushun, and other places. (2) The Changchun security team was reorganized from the puppet army and was not qualified to be in Changchun. In principle, they insisted that the ceasefire order should not be an exception in Northeast China.

[Report from this newspaper's Shenyang bureau, dated the 8th] On May 1st, the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party moved to the former Manchukuo Coal Building in Changchun. The Communist army appointed Liu Juying, the original mayor of Changchun, to resume his former position. Regarding the Central News Agency's telegram from Washington on the 28th stating that the American reporters remaining in Changchun enjoyed full freedom of movement, this is completely untrue. On the 29th, a protest telegram was sent to the Communist leader Mao Zedong. The reporters were only able to move about slightly on May 1st, first going to the train station to inspect. In front of the station were four newly built Soviet graves, representing those who died in the recent battle. Water and electricity have been fully restored in the city. In terms of transportation, the trams from the city to the suburbs are running smoothly. Although the Communist side has tried to promote prosperity in general commerce, it is still extremely desolate, with most shops tightly closed. Although there are occasionally one or two shops doing business, they all have prices but no goods. The general cost of living is three times higher than normal. Government officials in Changchun have now been captured by the Communist army and imprisoned in various places. Mayor Zhao Junmai originally lived in Madame Chiang's residence. On the morning of April 24th, the Communist side sent people to search his clothes, very strictly. In the afternoon, Zhao Junmai, Lai Bingyu, Zhang Dabai, and Qian Yaozhang were moved to the Fu Zhou Inn near the train station. On May 2nd, Zhao was still under Communist surveillance and had a one-hour conversation with reporters at their residence. After that, Zhao's whereabouts were unknown. As for the airport, both the north and south airports have been completely destroyed. At the west airport, reporters witnessed slight damage to the buildings, and the runways were still in good condition, but the Communist side had placed many obstacles, making it very difficult for the reporter's plane to land. Although Changchun is full of spring colors, this miniature Washington is still mired in winter.

### Striving to Enhance Sino-American Relations and Build a Foundation for International Peace: General Eisenhower Speaks to U.S. Military Officers in Nanjing

[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing bureau, dated the 9th] This afternoon, General Eisenhower, Marshall and General Gillem reviewed various issues of the American military in China. Eisenhower gave an intimate speech to over 400 American officers and soldiers in Nanjing, clearly stating that the American military in China has an important mission and cannot return to the United States for the time being, hoping that under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and Marshall, they can complete their due tasks. The American officers and soldiers in attendance were greatly inspired.

[Report from the Associated Press, Nanjing, dated the 9th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower declared in Nanjing today: "We in America do not believe that the world can long endure in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion, attacks, and constantly stepped-up armament." General Eisenhower, on this tour of the U.S. military defense zone in the Far East, upon arriving here from Okinawa, addressed the U.S. military, saying that the U.S. military is stationed in China for no ill motive other than to gain friendship with America. "We only want to follow the path we believe is necessary for the country and provide assistance. Therefore, any unnecessary interference should be avoided, and we should do our best to strive for it. This five-star general, commander of the Allied forces in the European War, was welcomed at the airport by President Truman's special envoy Marshall, Chinese Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng, and Army Chief of Staff He Yingqin, among other dignitaries. This afternoon, a banquet was hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife.

While General Eisenhower was speaking, the audience listening were several hundred U.S. military liaison personnel. General Eisenhower also said: "When the gunfire stops, it does not mean that the war is over. Our navy and army are still working together for a certain purpose. From a national point of view, this purpose may be a selfish purpose. We are friends with China, so we are working tirelessly in that regard. Our theory is that we are willing to help those who help themselves, and we have no other ill motive other than to assist them from the side based on their own intelligence and talents. We want to improve relations, which is the foundation for all peaceful international relations. Our government is honored to entrust this important task to us military personnel. The task that the Chinese people personally shoulder is of great importance and unparalleled in the world. This task not only benefits the Chinese people but also benefits us. This task is also the most important of all the tasks we can obtain.

General Eisenhower also said: The motivation for this tour is that he has always commanded operations only on the Atlantic side, and he knows practically nothing about the war on the Pacific side, except for knowing its outlines from reports. He is now engaged in this with the same spirit as when the fierce battle was in full swing.

When asked if he was satisfied with the U.S. military's demobilization, General Eisenhower firmly replied, "No, I am not satisfied," and said: The army demobilization is very fast, and when he left Washington, the number of demobilized personnel had reached seven million. Military personnel on active duty should not serve for too long and must be replaced. General Eisenhower also asked each American soldier to directly tell the staff about their problems, and if they thought they should go home, they could tell them directly. According to General Eisenhower, he did not want to lead an army without independent consciousness and make soldiers become "forgotten men," but to assist them in every legal way.

General Eisenhower arrived quietly, and there were no other extravagant welcome ceremonies. After getting off the plane and inspecting the Chiang Kai-shek's personal guard of honor, he drove to Special Envoy Marshall's residence to meet and talk. There were no crowds welcoming him along the way, nor were there any other indications. General Eisenhower is scheduled to fly to Tokyo tomorrow to meet with General MacArthur.

### The Capital High Court Sentenced Mei Siping to Death Yesterday Morning: He Dared to Disregard Right and Wrong, His Actions Were Unforgivable

[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing bureau, dated the 9th] Mei Siping was sentenced to death by the Capital High Court after the trial was completed. Mei was escorted into the courtroom by four bailiffs, still wearing a light gray woolen robe, walking lightly, appearing quite calm. However, when the five judges all stood up and more than 2,000 people in the audience listened intently to the verdict, Mei's composure was finally broken by the tense and solemn atmosphere, and a look of fear appeared on his face. Judge Ge Zhitian read out the judgment, the main text of which said: "Mei Siping jointly colluded with the enemy, conspired to rebel against the country, and is sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. All of his property, except for what is necessary for the living expenses of his family, will be confiscated." Upon hearing the verdict, Mei's face turned pale instantly. The presiding judge briefly explained the reasons for the verdict and informed him that he could apply for a retrial within ten days in accordance with the law, otherwise the court would also submit it to the Supreme Court for review and judgment in accordance with the law.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, dated the 9th] Mei Siping was sentenced to death today in the Capital High Court. The main text of the judgment is as follows: "Mei Siping jointly colluded with the enemy, conspired to rebel against the country, and is sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. All of his property, except for what is necessary for the living expenses of his family, will be confiscated." The pronouncement of Mei's case today was held in the first courtroom of the High Court. Judge Ge Zhitian presided over the trial, with associate judges Zhou Heming and Zheng Li'e, prosecutor Wang Hongquan, and clerk Xu Jun. More than a thousand people were in the audience, all wanting to witness what punishment the law would impose on Mei, who was once a magistrate of Jiangning County, after he turned against the government. At exactly 10:00 AM, Mei was brought to court. After the court asked for his name, age, and place of origin, the judges all stood up and the presiding judge read out the main text and key points of the reasons for the judgment, which lasted only thirteen minutes. He also advised the defendant that if he did not agree, he could apply for a retrial within ten days. At that time, Mei's face was red and he looked nervous, but he did not say a word from beginning to end, and bowed and was escorted away. Here is the conclusion of the High Court's judgment: "According to the defendant's usual study of politics and law, and his mission during the war, he willingly turned against the government at a time when the enemy was deeply entrenched and the country was in danger of survival, betraying the central government and only caring about personal gain, ignoring the survival of the nation. If the central government had not insisted on fighting the war to the end, it would have put our country in a place from which it could never recover. He dared to disregard right and wrong, and his actions are unforgivable. Although the defendant stated during the investigation that he had protected the work of resisting the enemy in the winter of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], and maintained local security after the Japanese surrendered, assisting the central government in taking over, even if it were true, it was nothing more than a means of taking opportunistic tricks in the end and at dusk, and is not sufficient for reference in sentencing. He should be sentenced to the maximum penalty and deprived of his civil rights for life in order to maintain law and discipline and correct people's hearts."

### Chennault Passes Through Honolulu

[Report from the Associated Press, Honolulu, dated the 9th] General Chennault of the Flying Tigers, who went to the Far East with a secret mission, is now returning to Washington via China and passed through here today. It is said that the Chinese Communist Party has clearly received aid from the Soviet Union and wants to seize power in China. The National and Communist armies often bombarded each other with artillery. The Communist army's supplies often did not fall from the sky, and clearly came from the Soviet Union. I believe that there is no hope for an early resolution of the Chinese party struggle, and I expect that there will be many "fierce battles" before the civil war stops.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, dated the 9th] According to reliable sources, UNRRA has reached an agreement with General Chennault, and Chen will organize an airlift team with the permission of our government.

### Tianyou Monastery in Dongting Lake to Be Demolished by Order of the Executive Yuan

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] The Tianyou Monastery on the southern shore of Dongting Lake was built by the people of Hunan through embankment and land reclamation.

### Local Communications

Suzhou

Founding of City and Township Public Buses: This county is located along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, a key transportation hub, with a dense population and developed commerce. Currently, there are over 600,000 people, and the urban area is vast. The only means of transportation in the city are rickshaws and horse carriages, which are not only not up to modern standards, but also inconvenient for pedestrians. The Jinshan Automobile Joint-Stock Company in this county, in order to adapt to environmental needs, plans to establish an urban public bus company. In terms of business, it will comply with the urban public bus management methods promulgated by the Provincial Highway Bureau. The capital is tentatively set at 50 million yuan, and will be appropriately increased later as needed for military vehicles. The routes are divided into two lines. The first line starts from Guanqian Street, passes Jingde Road, exits Jinmen, passes Shiluxinmin Bridge, and reaches the railway station. The second line starts from the railway station, enters Pingmen, passes Hulong Street, Weiqian Street, Daoqian Street, and reaches Xumen. Both lines are two-way round trips, with four buses running on each line. Each bus is limited to 30 passengers. Business hours are from 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM. The fare is tentatively set at 200 yuan for half the route and 400 yuan for the entire route.

Firefighting Equipment Restored to Old Condition: The fire brigade of the County Police Bureau was unable to respond to fires in the past due to pump damage.

The results were good, and the old condition has been restored. It is said that the police officers of the team are quite proficient in rescue actions and firefighting techniques.

Please Increase Coal Supply and Allocate to Factories First: The County General Labor Union previously reported that the power plant stopped supplying electricity during the day, causing all factories in the city to shut down, resulting in the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers. The union telegraphed the Shanghai District Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting an increase in coal supply to alleviate the emergency. Now, a reply has been received: In order to provide emergency relief to factories that have stopped operations and unemployed workers, a portion of the planned coal supply will be approved for advance allocation to Suzhou factories for purchase, and then delivered to the power plant for use, opening up daytime motor electricity.

Taicang

Defense Corps Commander Repeatedly Solves Robbery Cases

Liuhe is the leading town in Taicang County. Since the Jiazi year, it has suffered heavy losses from repeated wars. Moreover, after the recent War of Resistance, it was ravaged by enemy bandits, and the local vitality was greatly damaged. After the victory, the market gradually improved. Currently, the fish season is on the market, and ships fill the port, which is very lively. The town is a port along the Yangtze River, so there are many merchants coming and going, resulting in mixed characters and very important security. Currently, it relies on the stationed National Army and the County Security Team, and the local businesses have organized a defense corps, with Mo Qifan as the commander. Since its establishment a few months ago, it has solved three robbery cases, which has been deeply appreciated by the county magistrate and local elders.

Ningbo

Seven Traitors and Thieves Escape from Prison

On the 22nd of last month, a shocking major case of traitors and notorious thieves jointly rebelling in the prison occurred in Ningbo City. A total of seven people escaped, and they have not yet been apprehended. It is said that the Yinxian County Local Court detention center held more than 300 people, including Wang Tiancai's subordinates, Yu Xihuang, the pseudo-regiment leader, Zhang Zhilian, and the notorious thief Lu Tieshan, who once served as the pseudo-military captain, who were captured in Shanghai last month, as well as traitors awaiting trial. The detention center stipulates that inmates' families are allowed to deliver food on specified dates. Unexpectedly, the Lu offender secretly instructed his accomplices to hide a pure steel hacksaw in the food. The date of the internal and external cooperation was around 9:00 PM on the 22nd. First, they used a hacksaw to cut the iron bars, jumped out of the window, and then worked together to destroy the inner door of the prison cell at the foot of the surrounding wall. At that time, the accomplices who were lying in ambush outside heard the noise inside and immediately destroyed the outer door of the prison cell, so the inmates were able to leave triumphantly. When the guards discovered it and reported it to the warden, they went out to hunt them down, but they were nowhere to be found. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and only seven people escaped. Otherwise, if all 300 people escaped, Ningbo City would be unimaginable.

Mingguang

The Deadline for Prohibition of Opium and Drugs is Approaching

County Magistrate Shi of this county is quite determined to prohibit opium and drugs. Recently, the deadline for prohibition in the jurisdiction is approaching on the 13th of this month. It is reported that after the deadline, strict implementation of the investigation and prohibition will be determined. If smoking is discovered again, they will be detained and investigated. It is hoped that all the people in the county who have this habit will quickly quit, get rid of the dark registry, protect their health, and avoid stepping into the legal net.

Songjiang

Actively Promoting the Purchase of Military Grain

The part of Songyi military grain that is short of delivery must be delivered in full before May 15th, as limited by the province. The preparatory committee decided on the 6th to expand publicity through the propaganda group and purchase military grain in accordance with central regulations, with large grain households as the main target. Except for retaining food for their own use before the end of October, the surplus grain should be purchased. If it is concealed, dispersed, or evaded from purchase, the investigation team will investigate and verify it, and confiscate all of its stored grain. If it is hoarding for speculation, it will be severely punished.

Huzhou

Cai and Lu, Two Rebels, Arrested and Escorted to Huzhou

Cai Ziqing, the sixth district chief of Wuxing, was found to have allowed the people of Jiaorou Township in his term of office to do all kinds of evil. After being discovered and investigated by his superiors, Cai took his uncle Lu Lieqing and joined Yuan Ni Qingguang's troops of the Second Regiment of the Pseudo-Army, and became a major participant willingly. After the victory, they hid in Suzhou, free from justice. On May 4th, they were arrested, escorted to Huzhou, and interrogated according to law.

Hangzhou

Encouraging Reclamation and Exemption from Taxes for One Year

In order to promote rehabilitation work and encourage people to reclaim wasteland, the Zhejiang Grain Administration Office stipulated that if the land was deserted due to the Japanese occupation, and it could not be reclaimed in the 35th year, it would be exempted from rent and taxes for one year this year. The competent authorities at all levels should report to the higher authorities for verification in accordance with the procedures for rent and tax reduction and exemption. In addition to reporting to the National Government for record, the competent authorities have been ordered to handle the matter accordingly and to notify the public.

### The Failure of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference

— Chu Yukun

It has been two weeks since the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union held a conference in Paris. Although the Italian issue, the Balkan issue, and the German and Austrian issues have been thoroughly discussed at the conference, the opinions of all parties have become more and more divergent, and there is no way to get close, so that none of the issues can be resolved through negotiation. Not only has the purpose of the four foreign ministers' conference initiated by US Secretary of State Burns not been achieved, but even the goal of restoring normalcy in European countries as soon as possible has not been achieved; moreover, the result is sufficient to make the future of European peace feel more bleak, which is far from what Burns had expected at the beginning. Therefore, continuing the foreign ministers' conference is not helpful, and it is better to end it early and find another way outside the conference. Therefore, the four foreign ministers' conference decided to close in the next two days. People who are generally eager for the European peace treaty to be agreed upon soon cannot help but feel deeply saddened.

It has been a year since the end of the European war. During the war, the Allied countries were in a very difficult position. Fortunately, the joint efforts of the three powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were able to overcome all difficulties, destroy the strong enemy, and achieve final victory; but after the Nazis surrendered and the war ended, the European countries were in pain and reflection, and they could have hoped to share peace; however, the four powers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union had different opinions. Although international conferences were held repeatedly to negotiate the peace, no agreement could be reached. Therefore, two opposing worlds have formed in the international arena after the war, which has become even more blatant, and cannot but make people who are generally concerned about the times and love the country worry about the present. Former British Prime Minister Churchill witnessed the difficulties of the times, and he also shouted loudly to warn the world, and advocated that the United Nations should seek a friendly understanding with the Soviet Union; otherwise, mankind will face an unprecedented catastrophe, which is more cruel and dangerous than the two world wars that the Taiwanese people have encountered in their lives. Churchill delivered this cautionary speech when the four foreign ministers' conference was about to end unhappily, which has profound significance and is really worth our attention.

The most important of the issues discussed at this four foreign ministers' conference are four: (1) the Italian peace treaty, including the four issues of Italian reparations, colonies, navy, and borders; (2) the Balkan issue, including the navigation of the Danube, the revision of the armistice agreement, and the borders of the countries; (3) the German issue, including the Ruhr and Rhine regions; (4) the Austrian issue. These issues should have been resolved after the end of the European war; however, the five foreign ministers' conference held in London in September last year failed to reach an agreement because of the conflicting interests of the countries, each holding their own views and refusing to compromise, and would rather the five foreign ministers' conference end unhappily. Until December, US Secretary of State Burns initiated the foreign ministers' conference in Moscow, where the three foreign ministers were able to tolerate and concede to each other, and the atmosphere at the meeting was full of peace and light. For the issue of the European peace treaty, it was also decided to convene a peace conference in Paris before May 1 this year to completely resolve these issues. Then the United Nations General Assembly also opened in London, and the world was full of optimism and bright prospects. However, not long after, the Iranian issue in the Middle East caused an uproar in the international arena, making the rift between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain even deeper, almost impossible to fill. Fortunately, human conscience finally overcame any difficulties, making the precarious international situation turn into safety, and giving mankind some hope for the future of the post-war world. In mid-April, US Secretary of State Burns separately notified the authorities of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, initiating the four foreign ministers' conference in Paris, so that all the outstanding cases in Europe could be resolved satisfactorily and European countries could return to normalcy as soon as possible. Before the opening of the conference, we also thought that these issues had been discussed for a long time at previous conferences, and a compromise must have been reached. Now that the four foreign ministers' conference is dealing with them, it should not be difficult to reach an agreement quickly; however, after the conference opened, the objective facts and our ideals were completely different. Although these issues have been discussed at several international conferences, the deadlock is still difficult to break, and the opinions of the countries are divided, as in the past. When debating, each held their own views and never compromised; moreover, they argued fiercely, confronting each other with tit-for-tat, and not giving way to each other. Therefore, the international conference that was valued by the world had no choice but to end unhappily.

Last year, we studied the reasons why the five foreign ministers' conference ended unhappily. This year, we studied why the foreign ministers' conference had no achievements. Now, we are studying why this four foreign ministers' conference cannot break the deadlock. In a word, it is that there is a lack of a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation among the four powers. When encountering things, they cannot be honest with each other, but instead suspect and exclude each other; all countries weigh any issue from a selfish and self-interested point of view; not only do they plan for their own interests everywhere, but they also do not allow other countries to gain any advantage. Taking the situation of this foreign ministers' conference as an example, none of the proposals made by the Soviet Union at the foreign ministers' conference was for the benefit of the Soviet Union itself. For example, on the issue of Italian reparations, the Soviet Union demanded that Italy pay US$100 million in reparations to the Soviet Union; on the issue of the disposal of the Italian navy, it demanded that Italy hand over one-third of its navy to the Soviet Union; on the issue of the disposal of the Italian colonies, it advocated international co-management, attempting to invade North Africa with its power; on the issue of the Italian border, it advocated that the entire Istrian peninsula, including the port of Trieste, be ceded to Yugoslavia; on the Balkan issue, it insisted on maintaining the status quo of the border between the Soviet Union and Romania, that is, the Bessarabia region and the northern part of Bukovina still belonged to the Soviet Union, while the border between Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria must restore the pre-war state, that is, Hungary should return Outer Transylvania to Romania, and Bulgaria should return Dobruja to Romania. Why is this so? The reason is very simple, that is, it is entirely for the Soviet Union, and there is no other legitimate reason to say: Since Romania has given two pieces of land to the Soviet Union, it should not give other places to other countries. This is completely the style of power politics, putting the racial point of view aside long ago. In addition, US Secretary of State proposed to revise the armistice agreements of the Balkan countries and put the navigation of the Danube under international control, but because this proposal was detrimental to the Soviet Union, it was opposed by Molotov and could not be discussed. Such things are endless.

Looking at the agreements that were negotiated at the foreign ministers' conference, the Soviet Union has already gained a lot of benefits, but the Soviet Union is still not satisfied, and still insists on its original claims, and still bargains, the more the better. Under such circumstances, how can we hope that the four foreign ministers' conference can break the deadlock in Europe? The Soviet Union is one side, and the United States and Britain are on the other side. France is in the middle. When the United States and Britain have disputes with the Soviet Union, France never dares to clearly express its attitude, fearing to offend one side. However, when discussing the borders of Germany, France and Britain have conflicts of opinion, so the four foreign ministers' conference discussed the issue of the European peace treaty. Because the interests of the countries are different, there are mutual conflicts and disputes everywhere. The complex relationship between them is really too subtle. The failure of this conference is an inevitable result; and we dare to predict that if there is still no sincere understanding between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, if the countries still cannot put the safety of the world first, especially if the Soviet Union still cannot tolerate and make peace, then the 21 countries scheduled to hold a peace conference in Paris in the middle of next month, or the four foreign ministers to reopen the conference two months later, will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the five foreign ministers' conference in September last year. Therefore, we hope that today's international politicians and diplomats can raise their vigilance, face the reality, and quickly find a solution to the current situation from the crux of international politics. There is no need to specialize in convening international conferences as a skill, otherwise accumulating one international conference and establishing one international conference will be of no benefit, but will only make people wander between hope and disappointment. Only US Secretary of State Burns has made unremitting efforts for European peace, which is really worthy of our admiration, but we hope that other countries can take European peace as their army and jointly seek European stability.

### "Take Necessary Measures"? South Country Troops Gather Around Trieste. The Foreign Ministers' Conference Has Actually Failed. The Soviet Union Has Not Yet Agreed to the Proposal to Convene a Peace Conference.

[Reuters Paris, 9th] Since the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to resolve the Trieste issue today, people here are deeply concerned that Yugoslav radicals may force the South Country government to take drastic military action. According to secret maps and news from the Italian military intelligence agency received by the Italian representative in Paris, there are now 14 divisions of troops gathered in the three regions of Kiria, Ileria, and Istria. The largest number is gathered in the Difersiacogina area 30 kilometers east of Trieste, with six divisions. Troops are also gathered 40 kilometers northwest of Trieste, southeast and northeast of Chorizia, and at strategic points on the Istrian Peninsula. Italian sources also said that the Yugoslav Air Force stationed 60 kilometers east of Trieste has recently been reinforced by Soviet aircraft. Yugoslav Vice President Qatar is now in Paris. Yesterday, he said that the rumors of Yugoslavia concentrating troops around Trieste were meaningless, but he had previously made a statement to reporters, warning that if Trieste is not划归 Yugoslavia, the South Country government cannot be responsible for any incidents that occur, and that it will take "necessary measures" at that time.

[United Press Paris, 8th] US Secretary of State Burns suddenly proposed today that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference should admit failure and submit the various pending cases related to the European peace to the 21-nation peace conference on June 15. From this point of view, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will break down due to the conflict of opinions between the Soviet Union and the Western countries. According to a certain gentleman of the US delegation, the conference will drag on until next week, but there is little hope of resolving the major disputes. Burns' proposal was quickly endorsed by British Foreign Secretary Bevan and French Foreign Minister Biddle, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held a dissenting opinion and was probably asking Moscow for instructions. The British delegation explained that the conference has at least determined the differences of opinion between the Eastern and Western countries, and each other's positions are clear from this.

[United Press London, 8th] Well-informed sources here said today that the Soviet Union will oppose France's plan to separate the Ruhr region from Germany. It is known that the Soviet Union's determination to oppose the division of the Ruhr and Rhine regions is due to its long-term security plan and its hope for the full implementation of the Potsdam Agreement. It is believed that the Soviet Union will also oppose any plan concerning the future of the Ruhr region that does not involve the Soviet Union's participation in the control of German Western industry. Sources said that the Soviet Union is deeply concerned that an independent Ruhr region may again develop into a highly industrialized and specialized region, and that the entire German population will therefore have a tendency to become the "core of launching aggression."

[French News Agency Washington, 8th] The White House recently announced that President Truman recently spoke with Secretary of State Burns by long-distance telephone to inquire about the progress of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### Two Forces: Division Between the Soviets and the Anglo-Americans Set to Become a Reality

[United Press, Washington, 9th] Foreign affairs authorities here stated today that the division of Europe into spheres of influence by the Soviet Union, opposing the Anglo-American led Western powers, which has long been a concern, is now about to become a reality due to the failure of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. The future is viewed with little optimism, and developments are expected soon that will complete this division into two spheres of influence. Britain will imminently announce its support for U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes' proposal to implement far-reaching controls over Germany, with Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France signing a 25-year treaty to prevent Germany from waging war again. This proposal has been vehemently attacked by Soviet newspapers and is likely to be the final factor contributing to the division between the two sides. Continued efforts by the diplomatic community to eliminate the division and restore peace in Europe remain to be seen, but based on current indications, the existing disagreements between the Soviet Union and the Western powers within the United Nations Security Council and in handling various issues related to Asia and Europe seem likely to intensify. What worries the diplomatic community most is that this type of disagreement will create suspicion, hatred, and ambition, leading to a new war, which is precisely the state of affairs that the United Nations organization is trying to avoid. Apart from other influences, a powerful force could determine whether France or Germany will dominate Western Europe in the future. France has explained to U.S. officials that it is concerned about the possibility of the German Communist Party coming to power, while the Soviet Union has accused Britain of attempting to build a powerful new Germany in its occupation zone.

### American Political Commentator Walter Lippmann on the Anglo-Soviet Struggle in Germany: Said It Will Determine the Fate of the World

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Renowned American political commentator Walter Lippmann, in his second European travel dispatch, reiterated his warning that a struggle for control of the German people and their highly developed military potential is underway between London and Moscow. He further stated that Britain and the Soviet Union "are vying for position in preparation for war, which they consider not necessarily inevitable, but quite possible." The reason for the cold reception given by Britain and the Soviet Union to Byrnes' proposal for a four-power treaty is that the proposal fails to realistically assess the current situation in Germany. The crucial reason for the U.S. government's incorrect information is that the U.S. occupies an unimportant part of Germany. Under the current circumstances, Britain and the Soviet Union are dividing Prussia, while the United States and France occupy southern Germany. Because Prussia has controlled Germany since 1866, and because Britain and the Soviet Union are dividing Prussia, the internal drama of Germany is a struggle between the two countries to control Prussia. Lippmann predicts that this struggle will determine the fate of Germany, Europe, and the world. In analyzing the Anglo-Soviet policies in Germany, he stated that both countries harbor a desire to find a way to utilize a unified Germany to confront the other. While Britain and the Soviet Union are engaging in open duels through German political parties, both are secretly utilizing prisoners of war and un-surrendered German officials for future purposes. In this open duel, the German Communist Party is seeking to annex the German Socialist Party, so that the entire German working class can be unified under one command, while Britain supports the German Social Democratic Party and hopes that the German Labour Party can revive the Second International to counter the Communist Third International. Most notably, the political struggle between the two sides has now evolved to the stage of openly competing for interests with a price. Patriotic German nationalists currently hope to exploit the struggle between Britain and the Soviet Union to restore Germany's unity and enable the Germans to become a decisive factor in the European and world balance of power. Regarding U.S. policy in Germany, he strongly advocated that the U.S. should immediately expose and condemn what he called the insane Anglo-Soviet struggle, and, if necessary, intervene to eliminate this struggle. Finally, he warned the U.S. government to take on the role of mediator, as it would be extremely foolish for the U.S. to be drawn into the Anglo-Soviet struggle.

### Churchill Arrives in the Netherlands: Speech at the Dutch Parliament Yesterday

[United Press, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 8th] Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, accompanied by his wife and daughter Mary, arrived here by plane today and will be the guest of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. Dutch Prime Minister Schermerhorn, British Ambassador to the Netherlands Sir Nevile Bland, and the envoys of Canada, Australia, and South Africa were at the airport to welcome him. Churchill is scheduled to deliver a speech at a joint session of the Dutch Parliament in The Hague on the 9th and receive an honorary doctorate of law from Leiden University on the 10th.

### Roxas: Accused of Colluding with the Enemy: McNutt Defends Him

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Tokyo, 9th] Philippine President-elect Manuel Roxas, en route to the U.S., arrived here last night with U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Paul McNutt for a meeting with General MacArthur. The content of the conversation was not disclosed. When asked about MacArthur's opinion regarding accusations in the U.S. that Roxas was a collaborator with the enemy, MacArthur told reporters that Roxas was not a collaborator. "I have been closely associated with him for nearly 25 years, and his ideas have always been anti-Japanese. During the battles of Bataan and Corregidor, he was one of my most trusted and loyal subordinates. His actions were aboveboard. There are often foreigners who do not understand the truth and make irresponsible accusations of collaboration, but the recent election has proven that the Filipinos have rejected such accusations."

### Red Light Burning Brightly in the Room: Secret Anglo-Egyptian Meeting: Discussing the Situation Between the Two Countries After Britain Announces Withdrawal of Troops

[Reuters, Cairo, 9th] Plans for the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt continued to progress yesterday. British representative Sir Walter Smart held a secret meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Ismail Sidky Pasha for one hour. British Ambassador to Egypt Lord Killearn also attended. Although the content was kept secret, it is believed that the two sides considered the situation between Britain and Egypt after Britain announces the withdrawal of troops. At the time of the meeting, a red light was burning brightly in the room, indicating that even secretaries were not allowed to enter.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 8th] When the Egyptian House of Representatives met today, Prime Minister Ismail Sidky Pasha reported on the preliminary negotiations between Egypt and Britain regarding the revision of the 1936 alliance treaty. He stated that the time was ripe for Egypt to openly negotiate with Britain in order to stipulate a plan for the gradual withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, a final withdrawal date, and to discuss mutual aid measures to be taken in the event of a threat of war. Egypt has informed the British delegation that Egypt is prepared to conclude a new treaty with Britain within the scope of the United Nations Charter. The Egyptian authorities have provided close protection for the British delegation to prevent accidents.

### The Situation in Iran Is Not Entirely Clear: Security Council Postpones Discussion: Requests Iran to Submit a Report Before the 20th: Negotiations Between the Iranian Government and Azerbaijan Province Have Broken Down

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 9th Broadcast: The Security Council has decided to postpone discussion of the Iranian issue. The situation in Iran is currently not optimistic. Soviet troops have not yet withdrawn from Azerbaijan province, and negotiations between the Azerbaijan provincial delegation and the Tehran authorities are on the verge of collapse. A spokesman for the Tehran government stated that the demands of the Azerbaijan provincial representatives were not acceptable to the government. On the other hand, the Azerbaijan provincial representatives stated that they would not concede to the government.

[United Press, Tehran, 9th] A senior Iranian foreign ministry official stated today that negotiations with the delegation from the Autonomous Government of Azerbaijan have broken down because the demands of the provincial leaders are excessive. The Iranian Prime Minister, adhering to the letter and spirit of the constitution, has rejected these demands.

[United Press, New York, 8th] The United Nations Security Council discussed the Iranian case today, but the Soviet representative did not attend. British representative Sir Alexander Cadogan stated that the absence of Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko was an "evasion of responsibility and obligation." Australian representative Norman Makin proposed that the Council or another qualified body of the United Nations should find a way to resolve the entire veto issue and should also decide on disciplinary measures for a country's representative failing to attend a Council meeting. Ten representatives then voted to accept the proposal of U.S. representative Edward Stettinius, requesting Iran to submit a report on the withdrawal of Soviet troops on or before May 20th. It is significant that Stettinius's proposal only requested Iran to submit a report. The Council meeting lasted 43 minutes and then adjourned, but the representatives can be convened by the Chairman at any time. At the beginning of today's meeting, Chairman Mohammad Hussein Ali Yázdi read a letter from the Iranian Ambassador to the U.S., Ala, reporting that Soviet troops had withdrawn from four Iranian provinces, but whether they had withdrawn from Azerbaijan province had not yet been confirmed. Ali Yázdi also stated that the Council had not received a report from "another related party."

[United Press, New York, 9th] Iranian sources here expressed hope that a definitive report on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran could be submitted to the United Nations Security Council in the near future. Iranian sources seemed quite satisfied with the Council's decision yesterday to postpone discussion of the Soviet-Iranian issue again until the 20th of this month.

### U.S. Exports in March Break a 25-Year Record

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th, Associated Press] It has been announced that U.S. commercial exports in March totaled $586 million. Since the $654 million in January 1921, this is the largest figure. These exports do not include those under the Lend-Lease Act or U.S. government exports. Total exports in March were $816 million, compared to $671 million in February. Imports in March were valued at $384 million, compared to $318 million in February.

### Attlee's Statement

Decision to Withdraw Troops from Egypt

Not Agreed to by Dominions

[Reuters, London, 9th] Prime Minister Clement Attlee admitted in the House of Commons yesterday that his statement in the debate in the House of Commons the day before that the Dominions also agreed to the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt was not in accordance with the facts. The Prime Minister expressed deep regret for this error. The Prime Minister said that the government had sought the views of the Dominion representatives but had not asked them to express their agreement. It is reported that at a meeting of Dominion representatives yesterday morning, South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts and Australian Foreign Minister Herbert Evatt specifically stated that the Dominions had not expressed their agreement and should request the Prime Minister to take note. When the House of Commons met yesterday afternoon, the Prime Minister rose to correct the record and stated that the Dominion representatives had no intention of making things difficult for the British government on this matter. According to authoritative sources, the Dominions were only informed of the government's decision after the plan for the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt was finalized. The Dominion representatives are all very concerned about this policy. Although they feel that future developments may prove the reasonableness of the measures taken by the British government, they cannot fully express their trust at present.

### The U.S. Expresses Deep Concern Over the British Withdrawal from Egypt: The Relationship Between the Great Powers in the Middle East Will Change: The Future Actions of the Soviet Union Are Highly Noteworthy

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Britain's announcement of the withdrawal of troops from Egypt may be a sign that the fundamental relationship between the great powers in the Middle East is about to change. At the same time, it also means that the British Empire is gradually weakening at its most vulnerable point. The Middle East is one of the world's most important strategic military areas. If viewed from the perspective of the development of U.S. foreign policy relying on the British Empire, the United States may be deeply concerned about this matter. In the eyes of countries around the world, the tide of British imperialism is undergoing a historic transformation. The most noteworthy thing at present is how this move will affect the Soviet Union's Middle East policy. Britain has controlled Egyptian politics for half a century, enabling it to control a large part of the Eastern Mediterranean. Some diplomats say that Britain's announcement of the withdrawal of troops at this time is not unrelated to Egypt's indignation at the report of the Anglo-American Palestine Inquiry Committee. The Soviet Union is particularly important in this relationship, as it has not yet indicated whether it will support the Arabs against the Jews or support the Jews against the Arabs in the Palestine conflict. If the Soviet Union joins hands with the Arabs in this, coupled with Britain losing its military position in Egypt, then the co-existence of Britain and the U.S. in the Middle East will be drastically overturned in the next five or ten years.

### The Soviet Union Still Remains Silent on the Palestine Issue

[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 8th] The rumor that the Soviet Union has formally stated its position on the report of the Anglo-American Palestine Inquiry Committee has been denied by Soviet Vice-Consul in Beirut, Yakovlev.

### Saudi Arabian King Warns Britain and the U.S.

[United Press, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 8th] Saudi Arabian King Ibn Saud told reporters today that the Palestine Inquiry Report is an act of bad faith and deceit. "I can no longer urge the Arabs to be patient. I hope that the British and U.S. governments will not implement these recommendations, so as not to complete this act of bad faith and deceit. European Jews must be settled, but the whole world has a part to play in solving this problem."

### Important Progress in Anglo-Indian Round Table Conference: Transitional Government Can Be Established Soon: Nehru Elected President of the National Congress

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 9th Broadcast: Two important developments occurred at today's continued Simla Conference. First, the Executive Council of the Viceroy of India has resigned to facilitate the formation of a coalition government. Second, Jinnah met alone with Nehru for two hours today. Related sources revealed that the situation has improved and a transitional government can be established soon.

[Reuters, Simla, 9th] Anglo-Indian negotiations continued this afternoon. It is reported that the proposals put forward by the British side have attracted considerable attention from both the Indian and Muslim sides. The British proposal is to divide the Indian provinces into semi-autonomous Muslim and Hindu regions, and to establish a central joint government with powers in diplomacy, defense, transportation, and other areas. This proposal is the basis for negotiations, and no counter-proposals have been heard so far, so there is a general sense of optimism about the Indian negotiations. Cripps met with Gandhi for two hours the day before. Although Gandhi is not a representative to the Round Table Conference, he clearly has considerable influence on the Congress Party. It is also learned that Viceroy Wavell met with Muslim League Chairman Jinnah yesterday to discuss the issue of the interim government. Jinnah stated that he does not intend to participate in the interim government unless the demand for the division of India is accepted first.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] Jawaharlal Nehru was elected today as the next president of the Indian National Congress. There were no other competitors in the election.

### Hindu Women Enjoy Legal Rights: Can Apply for Separation if Abused by Husband

[Reuters, Bombay, 9th] Hindu women, who have not enjoyed legal and social rights for centuries, have now won their struggle for liberation. The Central Legislative Assembly has recently passed the Separation and Maintenance Act, which stipulates that Hindu women can sue in court and apply for separation and maintenance fees if they encounter abuse, abandonment, polygamy, or change of religious belief by their husbands.

### Changes in British Government Personnel

[Reuters, London, 9th] The official announcement of Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Fuel and Power Foster's resignation stated that there would be some changes in the junior personnel of the British government.

### Due to War Crimes Trials: The Japanese Emperor Will Agree to Abdicate: Because He Will Inevitably Be Summoned to Testify During the Trial: His Situation Will Be Difficult in Public

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] Sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here revealed today that Emperor Hirohito of Japan may decide to agree to abdicate in the near future due to future war crimes trials. These sources also said that the Japanese government believes that the Emperor may be summoned to testify during the trial of former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and 27 other war criminals. This trial is scheduled to begin on June 3rd. Japanese government officials said that if the Emperor must personally attend to testify, his situation will be extremely difficult in public. In order to prevent the Emperor from appearing in court, the Japanese government is trying to take some special measures to allow the Emperor to submit written evidence to be read in court instead of appearing in person. Some believe that some people in the prosecution may insist that Hirohito must personally attend, and Soviet prosecutors may take this step. A Japanese official said: Emperor Hirohito originally intended to retain the throne until after the peace treaty was signed, but the possibility of being summoned to testify in court has had a significant impact on the issue of his abdication.

### Two Japanese Newspapers Reveal the Truth About the Nanjing Massacre

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Today's Yomiuri Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun published an article on an interview with Ishikawa, a former Japanese war correspondent who entered Nanjing with the Japanese army in December 1937 and January 1938, reporting on the facts of the Japanese army's arbitrary rape, massacre, and other atrocities in Nanjing. Due to Ishikawa's description of almost unimaginable atrocities, former Nanjing Japanese Army Commander Iwane Matsui and eleven others will be tried based on the 45th count of the indictment submitted by the International Military Tribunal.

### Matsuoka Temporarily Leaves Prison: Hospitalized for a Physical Examination

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Former Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka has been sent to a U.S. military hospital for a physical examination. This move may spare him from war crimes trials. According to defense attorney Kobayashi, Matsuoka suffers from tuberculosis and neurasthenia. With the permission of Justice William Webb, the president of the International Military Tribunal, he was transferred from Sugamo Prison to the Army Hospital for examination by doctors designated by the defense team and prosecutors. Chief Prosecutor Joseph Keenan agreed that whether Matsuoka is able to stand trial should be determined by the examination.

### The Japanese Social Democratic Party Decides to Form a Cabinet Alone: Katayama Visits Shidehara

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] Secretary-General Tetsu Katayama of the Japanese Socialist Party met with Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara tonight. It is believed that Katayama asked Shidehara to recommend him to the Emperor as the next prime minister and grant the Socialist Party the right to organize a one-party cabinet. Political observers here say that the Socialist Party's executive committee made the above decision after the Liberal Party indicated that it would refuse to cooperate with the Socialist Party if the Communist Party was invited to join the cabinet.

### The U.S. Helps Japan Restore Cotton Textile Production

[United Press, New York, 8th] President Claudius Murchison of the Cotton-Textile Export Association of America announced at the annual meeting today that U.S. agencies have almost completed various plans to enable the Japanese cotton textile industry to partially restore production under strict U.S. supervision. Cotton will be supplied to Japan at the actual U.S. market price, plus freight, without preferential treatment of government subsidies. Japan will then hand over 60 percent of its textile exports to the U.S. government authorities to pay for the cotton. If there is any surplus, it will be transferred to the U.S. military government in Japan. This policy is obviously very sound. In the coming years, we will probably no longer encounter unfair competition from Japan.

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] The first batch of 200,000 bales of U.S.-Japanese cotton will arrive in early June. The Japanese Textile Industry Control Bureau and the Japanese Textile Industry Association announced their distribution plans today. It is said that 120,000 bales will be used to manufacture cotton textile accessories to earn foreign exchange, and 80,000 bales will be retained for domestic consumption.

### Discussions on the Korean Issue Between the U.S. and Soviet Union Stall: Soviet Representative Leaves Unhappily

[United Press, Seoul, 9th] The joint U.S.-Soviet commission's discussions on Korean unification and plans for establishing an autonomous government have not yielded results. The Soviet representative then left today by special train for the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea. There are no signs of when the meeting can resume. At the same time, U.S. military commander in Korea, General John R. Hodge, warned the Koreans not to be unnecessarily agitated by the temporary adjournment of the joint committee, lest it undermine the goal of Korean independence.

### U.S. and Turkey Conclude an Agreement to Settle Lend-Lease Accounts

[United States Information Service, Washington, 8th] The U.S. State Department announced yesterday that the U.S. and Turkey signed an agreement yesterday regarding the settlement of Turkish Lend-Lease accounts.

Any reports regarding the amount, conditions, and timing of the loan are purely speculative.

### Negotiating to Rescue the World Food Crisis: Britain Sends Morrison to the U.S.; U.S., British, and Canadian Leaders Issue Declaration; United Food Committee Decides to Extend Termination

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] London's Downing Street officially announced yesterday: After Prime Minister Attlee and President Truman made contact through diplomatic channels, the British government has decided to send Privy Council Minister Morrison to Washington to discuss food issues in India, the United Nations, western Germany, and Southeast Asia with U.S. authorities. Mr. Morrison will depart within days. The chief representative of the British food delegation here, Hedong, left the United Food Bureau meeting yesterday before it concluded to catch a train and then a plane back to Britain to report on the consultations in the United States to Mr. Morrison. Observers predict that the talks in the United States by Mr. Morrison will involve three matters: (1) the failure of the United States to export a sufficient amount of wheat; (2) the U.S. policy of prioritizing aid to U.S. military occupation zones within Germany and Japan; and (3) the issue of the 200,000 tons of wheat that Britain has already allocated, which should be repaid within a certain period. Authoritative sources predict that Britain may abandon this request during this conversation.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 8th] President Truman of the United States, Prime Minister Attlee of Britain, and Prime Minister King of Canada, today issued a joint declaration. It announced that the United Food Committee has decided to postpone its termination until the end of this year due to the severity of the world food crisis. To prevent the expansion of famine, the distribution of food must still be controlled. Whether the committee will be extended again will depend on whether the food situation improves next year.

### U.S. Loans $1.5 Billion to China, France, and Italy

[Reuters, New York, 9th] U.S. diplomatic circles: The authorities have decided to lend $1.5 billion from the existing funds of the Export-Import Bank to China, France, and Italy. China is expected to receive approximately $500 million. It is also reported that the government has decided to no longer reserve $1 billion of the bank's funds, allowing it to be used for other purposes, because it does not know if the Soviet Union will negotiate a loan with the United States.

### Truman Issues Proclamation on Victory in Europe Commemoration Day: Opportunity to Establish a Peaceful World Still Exists, Will Give Mankind Increasingly Greater Hope

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th Special Dispatch] Today marks the first anniversary of the end of the European war. Ceremonies were held here to pray for peace and world friendship, but there was no extravagance.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 8th] President Truman issued the following proclamation on the anniversary of Victory in Europe:

We, the American people, on this first anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, will remember with gratitude and pride the United Nations men and women who sacrificed everything to strive for victory. In the past year, we have been able to more deeply understand the meaning of the gift that they gave to future generations, what it really is, what they gave us, not justice, but the opportunity to obtain justice, not security, but the opportunity to strive for security; not peace, but the opportunity to promote peace. Each of us should reflect on ourselves, in the past year, whether we have fully utilized the things that were exchanged for such a huge price. We cannot permanently obtain these opportunities. If we fail to make full, rapid, and unselfish use of them, we will miss them. One year after Victory in Europe Day, the opportunity to establish a just, secure, and peaceful world that came with victory still exists, but it will depend on the extent to which we maintain our own unity with other nations, and the extent to which we are sincerely and unselfishly dedicated to the great task at hand. This opportunity will give mankind increasingly greater hope rather than darkening prospects on future anniversaries.

Victory Day in Europe

[United Press, London, 8th] Bugles sounded in Paris today, playing "Last Post," celebrating the first anniversary of Victory in Europe. The bugle calls reached all the occupied cities of Germany and Austria. The only celebration in those locations was the sound of the footsteps of the Allied forces, many of whom had just enlisted after the end of the war. In Moscow, this bugle sound was not heard. Only speakers loudly shouted, like thunder, praising the Soviet Union's mission to achieve victory in the war, with smug satisfaction. In the solemn courts of Nuremberg and the Romanian capital, this bugle sound was also drowned out. Former high-ranking Nazi officials are now in the defendant's dock as war criminals awaiting trial. The weather in London was overcast, and this bugle sound was also not heard. The general public hurried through the rain, only thinking about celebrating Victory Day, self-defined on June 8th. Yugoslav President Tito broadcast to the army in the country's capital, declaring that Yugoslavia demanded the return of territories ceded to other countries by unequal treaties after World War I. Victory Day in Europe was a public holiday in Italy, but there was no grand celebration. The people were dispirited due to hunger and fear of the harsh peace treaty. Spain, ruled by the unstable Franco, announced that sixteen Germans deemed particularly hateful by the United Nations organizations would be sent back to their home country. Sweden, which had not suffered from the war, celebrated today with church bells ringing, the people were silent for one minute, and raised donations to help the starving children of Europe. Even in the foothills of Cabassi in England, there was no peace. Bandits roamed rampant, reportedly led by escaped German generals, still a major local disaster.

### Democracy Leaves No Room for Japanese Imperial Family: Prince Marries, Applies to Tokyo Imperial University, Fails and is Rejected

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Democracy leaves no room for the "sacred" Japanese imperial family. Tokyo Imperial University even rejected Prince Higashikuni Morinaga, son-in-law to the emperor, who failed the entrance exam. Higashikuni Morinaga served as a lieutenant in the Mukden Army and married Emperor Hirohito's eldest daughter in 1943. As the emperor's son-in-law, failing the entrance exam is embarrassing. At the same time, the Imperial University admitted female students for the first time, with several women passing the exam, which only adds to the humiliation. Morinaga is the son of Higashikuni, the first prime minister after the war, and is now thirty years old, but he decided to study with commoners in the spirit of democracy. Unfortunately, he could not answer the entrance exam questions and was rejected. In the past, members of the Japanese imperial family attended noble schools. Applying to ordinary schools is a post-surrender phenomenon. In addition, another member of the imperial family, Kariya, aged twenty-four, passed the entrance exam at Kyoto Imperial University.

### Ford Factory Shutdown: 100,000 Workers Unemployed

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th Associated Press] It is reported that most Ford factories across the United States will shut down starting at midnight on the 8th, and the number of unemployed workers will reach 110,000.

### Tao Guilin of the Construction Industry Discusses the Core of the Housing Shortage: Unites with Local Industry Peers, Initiates Overall Construction Planning; Hopes Banks Will Invest to Provide Convenience to the People; Previously Prepared Post-Victory Construction Opinions for Government Contribution

[Our Reporter] The city's housing shortage is serious, and there has been no thorough solution for a long time, which is of great concern to the general public who have no place to live. According to reports from various parties, it is said that there are many difficulties, especially in terms of funding. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Mr. Tao Guilin, a leader in China's construction industry, to inquire about the key to the current difficulties. According to Mr. Tao, the most important core issue at present, as a result of joint research by industry peers, has three points: (1) Land taxes are too high. Landlords earn very little after selling, so they would rather leave it vacant than sell it. (2) Those with substantial floating capital have no land to buy, and even if they buy it, they postpone renting out the house, and because the right to ownership is not free, they are unwilling to invest in it. (3) The cost of construction materials is expensive, and at the same time, the source is scarce, making it impossible to construct. If these three problems can be solved, the hope of recovery will be easier. Now, Mr. Tao has specially joined forces with the construction industry in this city to initiate overall construction planning, cooperating to purchase materials, etc., and should at least abandon personal interests and serve the society for several years. As for starting construction, it does not seem to be something that can be realized in the short term. Civilian housing must be built with the assistance of the government and local authorities. If banks can invest and allow residents to pay in installments, the civilian housing shortage can also be alleviated. Mr. Tao has compiled precise statistics on the number of houses lost in major domestic cities during the War of Resistance, the number of displaced people, and the quantity of materials required for construction. At the same time, he contributed several opinions to the government on post-victory construction issues, approximately as follows: (1) During the War of Resistance, many houses were lost in various places, and future recovery will require a huge amount of construction materials. It is hoped that the government can coordinate with the people to handle it. (2) Urban projects should have an overall plan. Makeshift solutions are extremely easy to damage, which not only hinders the appearance of the city, but also consumes human, financial, and material resources. It is hoped that the government will pay attention. (3) Government office buildings and public buildings are mostly uneven. They should be designed by experts, and the government should select and stipulate styles for the country to use, so as to distinguish between official offices and civilian houses. (4) Many skilled workers have died, and there is a shortage of talent. It is hoped that the government can borrow and allocate machines as much as possible to compensate for the shortage of manpower and increase work efficiency. (5) Rural construction should be based on simple and unadorned standards and stipulated according to the size of the scope. Factory buildings should be spacious to prevent messy additions when expanding the scope in the future, and attention should be paid to workers' health and safety issues. Mr. Tao presented his opinions and statistical tables to Chairman Chiang for review, which was deeply approved by the Chairman, and it was said that he had personally discussed the rapid recovery and construction of various places. Shanghai's Nanshi and old urban areas should first repair roads and connect sewers, and then build houses, which has been actively researched and planned by the Municipal Government's Urban Design Committee. In Nanjing, the Chairman ordered the construction of 100,000 houses first, and some have already started construction separately.

In order to promote the construction of houses to solve part of the housing shortage, Mr. Tao himself plans to start construction of more than 100 houses in Shanghai's Tiyuhui Road and Nanjing in two or three months, which will be sold to citizens at the lowest price.

### Nanshi and Huxi Districts Plan to Establish Gas Branch Plants

Equipment and Materials Will Be Moved from Japan

[Our Reporter] The Wusong Gas Plant in Zhanghuabang, Xixujia, Wusong, was established in 1940 by the enemy and puppet investment, and was directly under the puppet Greater Shanghai Gas Company. In addition to producing cooked coal, it also produces by-products such as tar stone gas. After the victory, it has been taken over by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and improved and reorganized. There are now more than 100 employees, producing 40 tons of cooked coal, 20,000 kilowatts of gas, and 2 tons of tar every day. All gas is sufficient for the residents of the Jiangwan city center. At present, the authorities plan to set up several gas plants in the Nanshi and Huxi districts, and the equipment and materials will be moved from Japan as part of the war debt compensation. The Executive Yuan has appointed Zhu Shiming as the head of the inspection team, and representatives from relevant parties have been sent to Japan for on-site inspection. If this gas plant plan can be realized as soon as possible, residents in Nanshi and Huxi will benefit greatly.

### Diamonds and Treasures Carefully Stored: Half of More Than 300 Cases of Traitorous Property Have Been Inventoried; Expected to Be Completed by the Beginning of Next Month

According to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, as of yesterday, the bureau had inventoried the property of traitors and collaborators, including Xia Qifeng, Zhou Yuying, Liu Yusheng, Jiang Shangda, Yuan Lüdeng, Wen Lanting, Wu Songao, Dai Yingfu, Fan Yongzeng, Xu Jidun, Mai Jingming, Yan Jiachi, Li Zuyu, Ye Xuesong, He Zhuoxian, Zhang Zeng, Tao Kangde, Xiang Zhizhuang, Huang Xianggu, Zhang Kechang, Zhang Songtao, Zhang Ke, and more than 150 households. According to the military authorities, there are more than 300 households of traitorous property sealed up. The Management Bureau is now selecting the less important and less complicated traitorous property for inventory first, and placing the traitorous property with huge assets, such as Shao Shi-jun and Gu Huanzhang, for inventory last. The entire inventory work is expected to be completed by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. As for the gold, silver, and jewelry in the traitorous property, they are concentrated in a certain place and inventoried after being inspected and appraised by experts. It is said that there are gold, silver, and jewelry in more than 100 of the 300 households. Starting from the day before yesterday, the Management Bureau, together with the person in charge of the military's sealed traitorous property, and Jiang Weixian, the supervisor sent by the Executive Yuan, began to take inventory. A total of ten households were inventoried the day before yesterday, and in the future, they will be inventoried twice a week. All diamonds and treasures are numbered and placed in specially made multi-layered cowhide envelopes. The outside of the envelope lists the serial number and household name, and both ends of the envelope are sealed with sealing wax by the responsible persons of both parties who are transferring the inventory. The inventory will be handed over to the Central Bank for safekeeping. The inventory of these precious jewelry and ornaments is expected to be completed by the end of this month as well.

Liu Gongyun Goes to the Capital for Instructions

According to laws and regulations, all of the property of traitors is confiscated, except for the necessities of life for their families. However, there are no explicit provisions for the standard amount of the necessities of life. In addition, before the establishment of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, part of the traitorous property had been taken over by the local courts. Whether this traitorous property should be managed by the Ministry of Justice or transferred to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for handling has not been explicitly decided by the Executive Yuan authorities. In addition, the government authorities have no explicit regulations as to whether the traitorous property of dead traitors should be handled in the same way as the traitorous property of living traitors. Liu Gongyun, Director of the Management Bureau, went to the capital a few days ago to ask the Executive Yuan for instructions on how to handle it.

### Public Utilities Bureau Orders 50 New Buses: New Routes Can Be Opened After One Month

In order to strengthen transportation and facilitate passengers, the Preparatory Committee of the Public Utilities Bureau Bus Company recently purchased 50 new buses from the US surplus materials under the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, with a total value of 350 million yuan. The size of the bus body is similar to the original ones, but the machinery is brand new and the speed is increased. All of them have been successively arriving in Shanghai and temporarily parked in the Pudong area. The person in charge of the association told a Central News Agency reporter that the company currently has 43 vehicles, but most of them are old. On average, only about 38 or 9 vehicles run on the (1) Nanshi Zhonghua Road, (2) North Henan Road, and (3) Zhongzheng Road every day. The regular expenses are huge, and how can there be huge sums to purchase new cars. Fortunately, the Joint Treasury approved a loan of 400 million yuan, which will be handled by representatives of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, with a low interest rate, and the purchase of all new cars will be used as collateral, and the contract can be formally signed within days. However, the new cars must be assembled in advance, and the company's repair shop is not large enough to handle it. At that time, there will be public bidding, including transportation and other expenses, which must be increased by an additional 100 million yuan. The date of operation is one month later, when a decision will be made to open new routes. The new routes are planned as follows: (1) Nanjing Road or Beijing Road area, (2) Xujiahui to Caojiadu area, (3) Possibly in the Hongkou area.

### List of Elected Senators to Be Announced

Xiang, Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Department, told reporters: The results of the voting in each district of the Shanghai Senate election have been reported to the government successively, except for District 4, where there are still two senators' places due to disputes over invalid votes, which have not yet been announced, and Districts 9 and 19, which will be elected after the national ID cards are processed. The Municipal Government will officially announce the list of elected senators in each district and report it to the Election Headquarters for verification and record. It is still difficult to predict when the formal Senate will be established.

### Anonymous Accusations of Traitors and Collaborators Not Allowed: Real Names and Addresses Should Be Provided; The High Court Will Not Accept Blank Letters

[Our Reporter] Since being ordered to accept traitor cases, the Procuratorate of the Shanghai Higher Court has received many accusations from the people. After accepting them, the Procuratorate has intensified its investigation, and those who are suspected of crimes will be prosecuted in accordance with the law. However, there have also been repeated cases of anonymous accusations and malicious accusations. The Procuratorate specifically issued Announcement No. 5 yesterday, stating: "It has been investigated that traitors and collaborators have harmed the country and the people, and the people are originally allowed to strictly report them to promote discipline. However, reporting should also be done in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, in writing or verbally, in order to comply with the procedures. Recently, the office has received anonymous accusation letters, several every day. There are those who report traitors and collaborators out of public righteousness, and there are also many who fabricate facts and make malicious accusations. After this office investigates in accordance with the law, there are even those who not only find nothing, but also find no one at all. A blank letter distorts right and wrong and affects human rights. It is not a trivial matter. If no restrictions are placed, it will not be enough to stop the trend of abusive lawsuits. In the future, all reports of traitors, collaborators, and other cases of traitorous conduct should be made with real names and detailed addresses. This office will keep the secret within a possible range. Those without names or with false names will not be accepted. This is hereby announced."

### High Court Trial: Suspicion of Treason Rises in Four Cases

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning, the High Court tried four suspected traitors:

Shen Baozhou

A native of Tianjin, 34 years old, a graduate of Hebei Provincial High School, and studied politics at Meiji University in Japan. In May of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he joined the enemy puppets, willingly betraying the country and serving as a supervisor in the puppet Sanxing Salt Company. In August of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), through the introduction of Lan Baosun, a shareholder of the company, he was transferred to the position of director of the puppet "General Mobilization Society" Beijing Office. He colluded with the Japanese advisor Naitō Kōichi, conspired with Japanese invaders, and purchased over 10,000 tons of military rice, causing great harm to the people. Shen, during yesterday's trial, attempted to quibble, claiming that his work was merely carrying out orders, and that he always had the interests of the people in mind, striving to fight for them with the Japanese side. He spoke and laughed as if nothing were wrong, seemingly unaware of his situation. After Judge Qiu rebuked him, the case was adjourned for retrial and the defendant was returned to custody.

Shao Shuhua

A native of Zhenhai, 60 years old, formerly one of the four deputy managers of the puppet Central Reserve Bank. He held the position from March of the 30th year of the Republic (1941) until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when he was arrested by the Military Statistics Bureau. According to the defendant, he had served in politics before the 16th year of the Republic (1927), and then went into business for himself. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, he originally planned to retreat westward into the interior with the government, but due to his large family, he was unable to do so. Later, due to difficult living conditions, and agreeing with the puppet Central Reserve Bank's aim to "avoid the indiscriminate issuance of military currency by the Japanese army and the destruction of our country's economy," he resolutely took the position. However, during his time in the puppet government, he never engaged in hoarding or speculation, or discounting and lending. He claimed to be merely a deputy manager engaged in administrative work. The court adjourned for retrial.

Wang Zhiping

A native of Hangzhou, 59 years old, residing at No. 4, Jiuxing Lane, Changsheng Road, Hangzhou. He graduated from the quick-training course of the Hangzhou Military Academy in the 30th year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1904). Starting in July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country, successively serving as the intelligence section chief of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Police Department, a staff member of the Second Section, the director of the puppet Wukang Police Bureau, the director of the puppet Jinhua Police Bureau, and the director of the puppet Haiyan Police Bureau. After the victory, he was arrested by the Investigation Office of the Third Theater and handed over to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. According to his confession, he served as the supervisory director of the liaison station of the Third War Zone in May of last year. As for his position as the intelligence section chief of the puppet police bureau, he vehemently denied it. Judge Qiu adjourned the case for retrial pending further investigation.

Kang Zhuang

(Also known as Kang Shan), a native of Nanhui, 38 years old, residing at No. 205, Xichenghuang Street, Zhoupu, Pudong. When the enemy puppets occupied Sanlintang, he served as the chief interrogator of the puppet Sanlintang Grand Interrogation Post. While in office, his subordinates killed Lu Chen, Wang Lu, Yuan Fugen, Li Guisong, and others. After the victory, Lu Jinqi and other family members of the victims filed a lawsuit. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, the facts were confirmed, and he was prosecuted under Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Procedure Law. At the hearing yesterday morning, Lu Jinqi and four others all appeared in court.  The trial was adjourned.

### Xi Shu Returns to Shanghai: Thoughts on Trip to Beijing

National Assembly Preparatory Committee to Adjourn Soon

National Assembly representative Xi Yujin returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday due to his mother's illness. A reporter made a special visit to interview him, inquiring about his impressions of the trip. Xi said: "I stayed in Beijing for nine days, attended eight preparatory meetings of the National Assembly, and participated in the grand ceremony of the return of the capital, as well as Chairman Chiang's tea party at the National Government on May 5th. I deeply admire the enthusiastic sentiments of representatives from all regions, especially those from abroad and the border areas, to discuss national affairs and support the national policy of returning power to the people. However, I am somewhat disappointed that the meeting was postponed due to the situation." Xi also said: "On the afternoon of the seventh, Chairman Chiang hosted a tea party for the representatives of the National Assembly to explain the difficulties of postponing the National Assembly and sincerely expressed that the date of the National Assembly meeting would not be far off. The representatives were deeply moved by the Chairman's concern for the country and expressed their support. They hope that all parties will prioritize national affairs, achieve the goal of convening the National Assembly as soon as possible, and lay the foundation for national development. This is also the hope of the people of the whole country." It is reported that the National Assembly Preparatory Committee will temporarily adjourn soon, and the representatives remaining in Beijing will take this opportunity to study the constitution so that they can make a contribution.

### Taiwan War Criminal, Sawamaki Yoshio, Tried for the First Time Yesterday: Abuse of Prisoners Confirmed: Sentencing Scheduled for This Afternoon

The US War Crimes Tribunal tried Japanese war criminal Sawamaki Yoshio, who was escorted from Taiwan to Shanghai, for the first time yesterday. The defendant was charged with abusing a US Navy lieutenant in Taiwan in October 1944. Sawamaki, now 32 years old, was a major in the Japanese army's intelligence unit in Taiwan in 1944. At that time, the US Navy was engaged in reconnaissance work along the coast, and US Navy Lieutenant Holibise was arrested by the Japanese army for interrogation. Holibise refused to disclose any information, so Sawamaki Yoshio resorted to torture. He then imprisoned Holibise. Sawamaki, with a cruel heart, was still wearing his military uniform in court yesterday. His 34-page confession stated: "At that time, the Japanese army was ordered by the government to closely guard the war criminals to prevent them from acting out of line and to ascertain the origins of each war criminal." He also stated: "All prisoners received good treatment. They had the opportunity to smoke cigarettes, and he denied using torture to harm Holibise." The plaintiff's lawyer sternly pointed out that the core of the defendant's charges was violating international law, abusing war criminals, betraying humanity, and beating Holibise unconscious, causing physical harm. He also stated that Sawamaki was a Japanese army major who had received higher education, and knew the difference between right and wrong, making his crime unforgivable. He requested the presiding judge to impose a heavy penalty. The defendant's lawyer did not speak. The presiding judge announced that sentencing would take place at 2 p.m. today (the 10th).

### Major Kidnapping for Ransom Case: Two Criminals Executed by Firing Squad

[Our Newspaper Report] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday executed two kidnappers for ransom, Wang Shimin, 24 years old, from Fengxian, and Liu Jinsheng (also known as Jin Sheng), 42 years old. These criminals, on the morning of February 21st of this year, at 10 a.m., used another criminal, He Weiguang, under the pretext of a visit, to break into the home of Jin Rongshou at No. 6, Lane 181, Madang Road, and kidnap his young son, Mingdao, and hide him in the home of Zhao Shao in the eighth household of the third pao of Shenzhuang Bridge in Nanhui County. Two days later, Wang wrote a letter, claiming to be from the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, and sent it to Liu Chunian, a relative of the victim, demanding US$3,000 for ransom. After the victim reported the case to the police station, officers were dispatched to arrest them. After interrogation by the military law office of the Garrison Headquarters, the facts were confirmed, and they were sentenced to death in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 9 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. The execution order was approved by telegram from Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., their identities were verified, and they were taken to the execution ground on Song Park Road and executed by firing squad.

### Strange Drama at Temple Fair: Seeking Dead People's Heads for Religious Offering: Lawsuit Filed After Incident

Hua Jinsheng, a resident of Yangjing District, Pudong, died of illness in September last autumn and was buried in Guojia Sha, the town he lived in. He left behind a wife and four children. This spring, during the Qingming Festival, his wife, Mrs. Li, took her children across the river to sweep his grave, only to discover that the coffin had been dug up, the coffin lid burned to charcoal, the corpse stolen, and multiple knife marks on its neck. Mrs. Hua Li fainted immediately upon witnessing this tragic scene. After being rescued by nearby villagers, she investigated the cause day and night and finally learned that the South Wharf Fifth Road Hall recently initiated a temple fair, and someone instructed people to obtain several heads of corpses that had not yet decayed, to be offered to the gods. After the police station learned of this, they realized it was a superstition and ordered it to be prohibited. However, although the actual offering was not carried out, the dead people buried underground had already suffered the tragedy of being separated from their heads. Such an evil custom is truly shocking. It is reported that Mrs. Hua Li has pleaded to the authorities to severely punish the criminals and has filed a lawsuit against the instigators.

### Publishing Boom is Over: Small Newspapers Face Crisis: Innovation May Lead to Unique Success

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai publishing industry, after the victory, produced an abnormal phenomenon, namely, the successive emergence of small newspapers replacing weekly publications, with such momentum that it almost suffocated all other publications, greatly affecting the sales of various books, newspapers, and magazines. Today, newsstands are mostly occupied by such publications, which are so colorful that people are dazzled by them. The reporter conducted a detailed investigation of this matter, and the results showed that there are currently as many as seventy-three such publications. These include: Haifeng, Xinsheng, Heizi, Shanghai Tan, Haipai, Da Hu, Hu Feng, Wenlin, Yijing, Haibin, Ruanxing, Banyuedao, Haitian, Tanxing, Fengguang, Hu Guang, Hai Sheng, Wanxiang, Xiangxuehai, Da Shidai, Leyuan, Hu Xing, Chenguang, Qiuhaitang, Yizhoujian, Shijie Huabao, Tuhua Feng, Haineiwai, Wenchao, Jipu, Hai Guang, Daguan Yuan, Xin Shanghai, Tiandi Ren, Jinghua, Wuxian Dian, Yuanzi, Qiritan, Hai Xing, Hai Pin, Hai Tao, Zhoubo, Wenfan, Xinbao Zhoukan, Haichao, Hai Hua, Da Guang, Sanzi Jing, Da Guangming, Shifei, Qingbao, Kuaihuolin, Haiyan, Qichongtian, Wanhua Tong, Xianggang Huabao, Tuwen, Xingguang, Piao, Taishan, Xin Tiandi, Shidai Feng, Dongnan Feng, Xianshi Bao, Chunhai, Yefeng, Minjian, Yangzi Jiang, as well as Xiaojie, Kafei, Zhizun Huabao (semi-monthly), Shanhai Jing, Zhilan Huabao (ten-day publication), etc.

Two Reasons for Popularity

We tried to investigate the reasons for their popularity and found that there are at least two factors. First: Small newspapers in Shanghai have a long history and a certain number of readers. After the victory, many were ordered to cease publication by the authorities, while at the same time restrictions were placed on the registration of new publications. Therefore, these publishers changed them into weekly publications, because this was not subject to registration restrictions. Second, and most importantly, people wanted to read them. Since Haiguang and Haifeng started it, because the sales were exceptionally good, successors emerged like bamboo shoots after rain, and at the most prosperous time, one or two types were published every day. Seeing that there was profit to be made, why not do it? Thus, Shanghai became a world of small newspapers.

From a good perspective, small newspapers have their own characteristics, focusing on entertainment, unlike the seriousness of large newspapers, and providing news outside of news, which is rare in large newspapers. In this way, small newspapers can supplement the shortcomings of large newspapers, and reading them after tea and dinner may not be without benefit to one's knowledge. However, the general small newspapers in Shanghai today, as Bureau Chief Wu Kaixian of the Social Bureau said: "Although there are not a few with pure purposes, those who use rumors and attacks and heavily colored erotic manuscripts to attract readers are truly harmful to public morals." Indeed, the topics of most small newspapers today, in order to cater to readers, that is, for the sake of business, specialize in revolving around the yellow circle!

Eleven Kinds Prohibited from Publication

This is by no means a good phenomenon. That these Haipai small newspapers with yellow news can gain a foothold in Shanghai and still obtain a wide readership fully reflects the current social and general psychology of Shanghai. They are in an abnormal psychological and living environment, and using yellow news as a stimulus is a truly dangerous anesthetic!

Seeing that in trams, trains, large cities, and small towns, most people have a copy in their hands, one can imagine how widespread their circulation is, and their impact is really too great. Therefore, some people have shouted the slogan of a news purification movement, advocating strictly banning these yellow publications. At the reception for the press held by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee in Nanjing on May 6th, Mr. Pan Gongzhan also specifically raised this point, requesting that it be corrected. In Shanghai, the birthplace of these publications, the Social Bureau has already issued a notice ordering all publications to register and be reviewed. Ten days ago, the first batch of Shanghai Tan, Qichongtian, Xiaojie, Jinghua, Haibin, Haipai, Yijing, Heibai, Wenlin, Da Hu, Yuanzi, etc., eleven types in total, were banned from publication by the Social Bureau in conjunction with the Police Bureau, on the grounds that the content was bad or that they did not comply with registration procedures.

Those Making Money Want to Quit

However, in any case, by now, the trend of small newspapers has passed, because now it is impossible to use yellow news as a selling point after the crackdown. The materials for some political secrets and celebrity anecdotes have been written to the point of exhaustion. Shanghainese have also become tired of news about Bai Yun, Yan Huizhu, etc. In addition, those who have made money have made enough, and seeing that the situation is not good, they also want to quit. The business of those continuing to publish is not as good as before, and those who have not published do not dare to invest rashly. Therefore, today, it can be said that the publishing boom of these small newspapers is over. Now that small newspapers have reached this serious juncture, if they continue to only focus on gimmicks and eroticism, then they will be eliminated by the trend of the times and will not be able to stand. On the other hand, based on its own history and position in the past, if it seeks innovation and progress in content, editing, interviewing, and printing, then it may be able to stand out and complement large newspapers as a spiritual food for the people. This question of advancing or retreating must be left to their organizers to decide for themselves!

### Male and Female Students Misunderstand Freedom: Two Couples Detained from Wuxi

[Our Newspaper Report] Mrs. Lin, the wife of Gu Gengmei, the director of the Dagong Hospital at No. 29, Lane 1400, Beijing West Road, reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station at 5 p.m. on the 29th of last month, saying that her daughter, Gu Chuanling, 17 years old, on the morning of that day at 6 a.m., under the pretext of a monthly exam, got up early to prepare for her studies, secretly went to the room on the fourth floor, opened the suitcase, stole a small iron box, and fled.

After a week, finally, on the morning of the 8th at 8 a.m., four men and women were arrested in Room 324 of the Jinghu Hotel in Wuxi. In addition to the Gu girl, they were Xia Yinsheng, 19 years old, a freshman in the law department of Daxia University, Zhou Wenhe, 19 years old, a student at Xuhui Middle School, the son of Zhou Bangjun of the Zhongxi Pharmacy, and Xie Puyun, 17 years old, the daughter of Xie Fanglin, a shareholder of the Nanhai Hotel. According to their confession, Xia and Gu Chuanling, and Zhou and Xie Puyun, developed love from friendship, all believing that marriage was not free, so they wanted to leave their families and plan to elope. They went from Shanghai to Nanjing and then back to Wuxi, then to Luoshe, and back to Wuxi, before being caught by the police. The people and the stolen goods were brought back to Shanghai. After a preliminary hearing by Zhou, the head of the sub-bureau, they confessed without hesitation. It is scheduled to be sent to the Municipal Police Bureau for verification this morning.

### Health Bureau Director Yu Discusses the Problem of Unlicensed Doctors

Regarding the fact that "Western doctors who have not obtained a license to practice" will organize a petition group to petition the central government, Health Bureau Director Yu Songjun issued a statement on this issue yesterday, stating: "Regarding this petition from unlicensed doctors, I personally hope that they can get their wish, but I believe that this petition alone may not be able to get the government to recognize their medical qualifications. The most appropriate way is still to pass an examination."

### Fuxin Flour Factory Replaces Freight Workers: Original Workers Request Mediation from Authorities

[Our Newspaper Report] The No. 3, 6, and 2 Fuxin Flour Mills and transportation warehouses of this city employed more than 200 workers in the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926) to carry goods in and out. Serving until now for nearly two decades, only more than 70 of the old workers remain. Recently, the factory suddenly intends to hire new workers to replace them. Yesterday, Xue Yougui (also known as Zhou Yonglin), carrying weapons, along with Wang Zhinian and Cai Bulou, led more than 200 people to the wharf to load and unload Western pine planks. The old workers were terrified at this sight. Because they recalled that they had served for many years, sharing weal and woe with the factory. During the Shanghai War of August 13th, they risked their lives to go to the factory and warehouse every night to grab and transport tens of thousands of bags of goods for the factory. As a result, workers were shot and killed or injured, but they did not seek compensation from the factory. They asked themselves that they had no faults towards the factory. Now the factory suddenly replaced them with new workers, which will put the livelihood of more than 70 old workers in a desperate situation. Therefore, they have pushed representatives such as Chen Ruihong to submit a report to the municipal government and the Social Bureau, requesting mediation and hoping that the factory will consider the difficult times and withdraw its order.

### Housing Dispute at Lixin Accounting School: All Faculty and Students Telegraph Authorities Demanding Fair Mediation

[Our Newspaper Report] The entire faculty and students of the private Lixin Accounting School in this city recently sent telegrams to the Ministry of Education, the Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Higher Court, requesting them to uphold justice regarding the repossession of the property at Lane 466, No. 4, on Rue Bourgeat. The original telegram stated: "Our school's premises were originally rented. When the war broke out, we moved to Sichuan. The rented premises were then taken back by the landlord. Recently, we received an order from the Ministry of Education to return to Shanghai to resume classes, but we could not find suitable school buildings. We were forced to temporarily use the school buildings of the supplementary school attached to our school in Jixiang Lane, Henan Road, for enrollment and classes. Although the school has tried its best to limit the number of students, only 150 students in three specialist classes have been admitted, and we are already facing difficulties. Furthermore, 700 faculty and students from the Beizhan Specialist Branch School are also gradually returning to the east, making it even more difficult to accommodate them. Moreover, the supplementary school's premises are already very small, and with 1,680 students, they are already insufficient. We have had to arrange for classes in the lecture halls of Fudan Shizhong School in a large building on Beijing Road and Zhiyuan Middle School on Rue Foch, but this is only a temporary solution. Principal Xu Lun, upholding his long-standing aspiration of donating funds to education for 20 years, will donate the five-bay, three-story buildings at Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Lane 466, Rue Bourgeat, which he built himself, to the school for use as a campus in the city center. However, the tenants of the building, disregarding the urgent needs of thousands of teachers and students of our school, have ignored the letters from the school's board of directors and the repeated requests for relocation from representatives. After the court ordered them to relocate within three months, they have intensified their efforts and repeatedly published false advertisements and news in newspapers, and distributed leaflets, claiming that Principal Pan used pretexts to force relocation in an attempt to confuse right and wrong. All the teachers and students of the school are indignant upon hearing this. In addition to publishing a statement in the newspaper to clarify the facts and correct the record, we believe that the total number of tenants, including Xie Zhen, is only about 30 people, which can be verified by the household registration. If they had tried to relocate after receiving the notice from the school and the summons from the police last winter, they would not have been without options. However, these tenants have been trying to occupy the school buildings all along. The total number of teachers and students in our school is dozens of times greater, and it is even more difficult for us to find another campus in Shanghai. If there are no school buildings, then our school will be unable to continue operating, and thousands of students will be unable to continue their studies. We urgently hope that these tenants can relocate as soon as possible."

### Sharp Increase in Freight Charges on the "Minxian" Ship Sparks Reaction from Customs Brokers: Jointly Questioning Minsheng Company

[Our Newspaper Report] The Minsheng Shipping Company's "Minxian" ship, on its last voyage from Shanghai to Chongqing, had its freight transportation contracted to the Minyi Transportation Company. The customs brokers turned to Minyi for reporting and loading, and the freight charges suddenly increased by 125%. According to the regulations of the First Navigation Bureau, the freight rate on the Shanghai-Chongqing line is only 339,000 yuan per ton, but Minyi charged more than 750,000 yuan per ton. The Minsheng Company also restricted the customs brokers from charging customers, only allowing them to charge 5% of the water freight, and requiring them to pay 2% to Minyi as a signing fee. At that time, the customs brokers were afraid that the goods could not be exported, so they reluctantly endured it. After the goods were exported, they reacted strongly and jointly questioned the company, but there has been no response yet. The main points of the customs brokers' questioning are excerpted below: "(1) Does your company calculate the water freight for loading passengers and goods on ships sailing to various ports in accordance with the regulations of the Shanghai Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications? (2) Does your company calculate the water freight based on the measurement of the Pingzhun Notary Public Office? (3) Your company is a legal organization jointly run by the government and merchants. This time, the "Minxian" ship was contracted to the Minyi Transportation Company, which has a close relationship with General Manager Lu, to sign the bills and transfer the goods to the customs brokers for transportation. Is there such a provision in your company's shipping regulations? (4) Does your company calculate the water freight for the goods loaded on the "Minxian" ship this time by adding 125% to the Pingzhun Notary Public Office's measurement in accordance with the regulations of the Navigation Bureau? (5) Your company instructed the customs brokers to charge customers 5% profit on the water freight, leaving only 3% as net profit for the customs brokers after paying 2% to the Minyi Transportation Company as a signing fee. If there is any overcharging, it will be punished. Is there a clear example of such an inappropriate calculation in your company's shipping regulations, or is it for the convenience of your own monopoly and deliberately interfering with the customs brokers, so that they cannot obtain a reasonable profit?" The above questions were raised, requiring the Minsheng Company to reply within three days. If they are ignored, they will be submitted to the relevant authorities and the shipping industry for a fair judgment.

### A Word of Advice to the Ministry of Education: All German Language Departments in the Country Should Immediately Switch to English

Recently, news that the Ministry of Education intends to switch schools that use German as the first foreign language to English has been widely circulated, and the general public is very welcome to this news, but until today, the Ministry of Education has not confirmed it. We are deeply afraid that it is a rumor, so we specifically list the importance of switching to English as follows for the reference of those who hold educational power:

(1) We learn foreign languages: except for those who take on special jobs, in the education sector, most of them are used to directly absorb foreign science and culture. Before the war, German science occupied a leading position in the world, so the more schools in our country that studied German, the better, because they could directly read German books and indirectly improve our country's scientific and cultural level, but it is different after the war. Germany has completely failed. It has not only failed militarily and economically, but also failed in science and culture, and it has failed even more miserably than in military and economic terms, because in fact, the Allied powers have blocked the printing industry in Germany, so that all German scientific and cultural books are out of print, and on the other hand, they have collected and transported all the instruments that can be used to study science. The meaning of the Allied powers is to make Germany no longer have scientific research, and even the German national language has been changed to English. Although the Allied powers' actions are inevitably harsh, for the sake of the future peace of the world, this is of course a necessary measure. Therefore, now there are no original German books, German science cannot progress, even they themselves are learning English, so why should we insist on learning German!

(2) Our country has few research institutes: Specially sending people abroad to study abroad will always follow in other people's footsteps and never catch up with them. This is undeniable. It is considered to be the disease of those who run education in our country, but even if we follow in other people's footsteps, we should follow in the footsteps of good people. Do we also want to follow in the footsteps of the Nazis? Moreover, as far as we know: two-fifths of the famous German scholars are in the United Kingdom and the United States, and two-fifths are in the Soviet Union. The rest are scattered in Spain and various parts of Germany and France. Some of them continue to receive support from third parties for research, and some of them have retired. Even if the research results supported by the former are published in German, they are published in English or Russian. Einstein once said before: "I like to write articles in German, but I publish my books mostly in English in order to be universal", so even if there are a few researchers in Germany, we cannot obtain their results in German, then why don't we switch to English!

(3) Lack of professors: Most of the professors in German schools now are German students after the First World War. They have rarely studied in the past ten years, and after the severance of relations between China and Germany, they have rarely consulted books, so they mostly sell old goods. Graduates become teaching assistants, and after the expiration of their term, they are promoted to lecturers and associate professors, even old goods are sold at a 70% discount, resulting in a degree that is declining, and even more so, I am afraid that there will be no one to sell old goods in the future, so in order to improve the quality of teaching and facilitate the transfer, we have to switch to English.

(4) Graduates are completely out of touch with society in terms of practical application because they learn German at school: Most of the various undertakings in our country are actually related to the United Kingdom and the United States. Many graduates have no use for their talents because they do not speak English, which has caused many jokes, so if the Ministry of Education really loves students, why force people to read this unsuitable language!

In summary, we believe that it is time for the Ministry of Education to switch German schools to English, because the times are like this and we cannot delay any longer. Currently, even a few painting bureaus that reprint Western paintings have rejected German, so if the Ministry of Education still wants to retain German, we hope that the Ministry of Education will run a German language college.

### Sacrificed Shoes

### Screening Measures for Students Enrolled in Colleges and Universities in Northeast China

[Central News Agency Nanjing News on the 8th] Regarding the screening and enrollment measures for students enrolled in colleges and universities in the Northeast region, the Northeast Commissioner of the Ministry of Education reported to the Ministry for approval. The main points of these measures are as follows: (1) Students who were enrolled in public or private schools in Manchuria or schools registered with the Manchurian Ministry of Education before the restoration of the Northeast shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures; (2) All colleges and universities and temporary universities and training classes in the Northeast should set up a student qualification screening committee; (3) The qualification standards for students applying for admission must meet the following requirements: (1) Graduates of public or private national high schools in Manchuria (2) Students enrolled in public or private colleges and universities in Manchuria, (2) Pure thoughts, upright behavior, and no violation of the laws on punishing traitors; (4) For students applying for admission who have been enrolled in the original school for less than half a year, after completing half a year of remedial classes, those who pass the exam will be allowed to be assigned to the first semester of the first year of university. Those who have been enrolled in the original school for less than one and a half years, after completing half a year of remedial classes, those who pass the exam will be allowed to be assigned to the first semester of the second year of university, and so on; (5) Students who were sent by Manchuria to study in colleges and universities in Japan who voluntarily enroll in colleges and universities in the Northeast shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures. Students who were sent by Manchuria to universities and colleges in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places in Manchuria shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

### Jiangxi Province's 35th Year Education Facility Plan

Following the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Jiangxi Provincial Recovery Conference passed the "Jiangxi Province Post-War Three-Year Education Plan," which was also discussed and approved by the Jiangxi Provincial Post-War Affairs Committee. However, due to the severe educational losses during the war and the excessive funding required for recovery work, the Director of the Provincial Department of Education, Cheng Shi-kui, has revised the original plan, prioritizing urgent matters and formulating the education plan for the 35th year. The policy has been set, and the principles remain unchanged, aiming to gradually complete the plan within three years. The following is a record of the educational facility plan for the province's 35th year:

(A) National Education

In the 35th year, the promotion of national education will be the sole central task. Efforts should be made to ensure sufficient funding and qualified teachers to improve quality. The plan will strictly follow the central government's Second National Education Five-Year Plan and the provisions for a five-year universal literacy education program for out-of-school adults. Compulsory education for school-age children and out-of-school adults will be enforced, with the goal of gradually universalizing national education. Based on the above principles, the important facilities for national education in the province in the 35th year are as follows:

Establishment of National Schools

In the 35th year, all 84 counties and cities in the province should have 2,362 township central national schools and 17,122 bao national schools (excluding township central national schools and provincial institutions concurrently operating bao national schools). All schools that were suspended due to the war should be restored. Newly established schools should be completed. Each township in all counties of the province should have one central national school, and each bao in 69 counties, including Fengcheng, should have one national school. Each three bao in 15 counties and cities, including Nanchang, should have two national schools. According to this standard, the number of children attending school in the province in the 35th year should be 1,348,787, accounting for more than 76% of school-age children. There are still more than 2,649,800 out-of-school adults. In the 35th year, approximately 781,000 people should be forced to become literate, accounting for more than 29% of out-of-school adults.

Enriching School Content

In accordance with the Ministry of Education's "Second National Education Five-Year Plan" and the recently promulgated "Grading Standards for National School Content Facilities," a comprehensive survey of the content of national schools at all levels throughout the province will be conducted. Provincial and county inspectors will be directed to conduct detailed surveys in each township and bao. Regarding school building facilities, teacher qualifications, compensation, funding, teaching administration, and other items, phased enrichment plans will be formulated based on the actual local conditions.

Promoting Literacy Education

In accordance with the Ministry of Education's recent "Literacy Plan for Universalizing Literacy Among Out-of-School Adults," literacy education will be implemented first in the provincial capital's demonstration areas, first-class counties, the fourth administrative district of each county, and the national education demonstration area of Nanchang City. In the 35th year, more than one-third of the existing illiterate population in each county's area should be eliminated. Counties that have not yet begun to implement the established plan in the 35th year will continue to proceed in accordance with the methods of the national education department of national schools at all levels.

Supplementing Needed Teachers

In the 35th year, it is currently stipulated that each central national school should have at least six teachers, and each national school should have at least three teachers, totaling 65,538 teachers in the province. In addition to the current 53,303 teachers on staff and the 5,200 normal school graduates in the 33rd and 34th years, there are a total of 58,503 teachers. There is still a shortage of 7,035 teachers. Qualified teachers should be supplemented through provincial examinations, or outstanding middle school graduates who have been screened by counties and cities should be temporarily assigned as substitute teachers. These teachers should be prioritized for training at temporary training institutes and given appropriate training. (To be continued)

### The Stock Market Turns Over Clouds and Rain Speculative Retail Investors Suffer Losses Jingfu Plummets by One-Third Other Stocks See Low Prices

Chinese stocks are turning over clouds and rain, and retail investors are suffering the most tragic fate. They are meat on the chopping block, allowing operators to slaughter them at will. For no apparent reason, they suffer heavy losses, with no protection whatsoever. Those who indulge in windfall profits can wake up! Jingfu's stock has seen a large number of shorts released in succession, leading to suspicion of the factory itself. Two or three major players have given up on trying to drive up the price. In fact, they are doing everything they can to play tricks. The stock market has been unable to recover for days, so the major players want to let go of it first. Jingfu bears the brunt. After the news was released by the major players, those who held the stock were worried about their profits and, after being abandoned outside the market, looked back and found that there were many stocks that were no different from Jingfu, but the market price was vastly different. They asked themselves and were greatly alarmed, and were forced to kill their stocks. Yesterday, the market continued the momentum of the previous day and fell sharply from 425 yuan, falling to below 300 yuan in the middle of the day, seeing a low price of 280 yuan, a plunge of 150 yuan on the day, reaching more than one-third of the market value, which is really absurd. Seeing the opportunity, the major players covered their shorts in large quantities, and their goal was achieved. Near noon, under the circumstances of short covering, they quickly made up a quarter of their shares, and the asking price continued to rise after the close. The atmosphere of speculative warfare and the blind following of retail investors are beyond words. From then on, it will definitely become more and more intense. Fortunately, the authorities should pay attention to it as soon as possible. Other stocks, such as Ruoshui yarn, saw a low price of 4,800 yuan. The most panic-stricken time for Meiya was 3,900 yuan. In the most panic-stricken time for Xinguang Qinxing, no one even quoted a price. Unpopular stocks and veteran stocks were also dragged down in the middle of the turmoil. Only Rongmeng saw a slight increase because the operators were better. In the afternoon, Yongsha and Meiya each fell by more than 50% from the previous close, Jingfu fell by 20%, Xinguang Qinxing each fell by 10%, Rongfeng rose slightly, and the other stocks also fell by a small amount from 5% to 10%. The asking price was slightly higher in the afternoon, and Jingfu's rebound was particularly strong, rising by 50%. Foreign stocks were unable to rise in the middle of the day, and Yisha once saw a high price of 14,200 yuan, but it was still sluggish at noon. As a result, all the stocks that closed earlier fell by about 50%.

### Bulls Exit Government Bonds Decline

Government bonds were once again dispersed by the police station, and they were most tired in the middle of the day. Holders, learning from the small Chinese stocks, took the previous car as a warning and sold them off. Tongbing fell from 6,750 yuan, and in addition to the police station's intervention, it fell to a low price of 5,800 yuan in the middle of the day, and then rebounded slightly, hovering around 6,100 yuan at noon. As a result, it fell another 600 yuan from the previous close, while Jia and Yi each fell by 600 yuan, Ding fell by 500 yuan, and Wu fell by 550 yuan.

### Gold Notes Stable

The price of gold was slightly stable yesterday. People's hearts were slightly agitated by the reports that the black market price of gold abroad was rising. However, due to environmental restrictions, drastic changes are unlikely in the short term. Speculators are not helping to stir things up. After opening in the morning at 16.12 million, it fell slightly again, and after 10:00, it broke into 16 million again. Still, no one registered with the Bank of China to apply for allocation. The lowest price before noon was 1.58 million, and the price at noon was 1.59 million. Transactions were limited, and the afternoon was the same. The situation was particularly stable, and the results were similar to the previous close. Ornament gold was 170,000, and pattern silver and silver dollars were unchanged. The underground interbank lending market gradually turned balanced, and the interest rate ranged from 17% to 20%.

Foreign currency US dollars did not break out of the consolidation, and fluctuated slightly with the price of gold. After opening in the morning, the highest price was 2,230 yuan, but after a flash in the pan, it fell slightly, hovering around 2,190 yuan at noon. The afternoon continued to be mediocre, and the reserves seemed to be dry. As a result, it fell slightly by 10 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong notes fell by 20 yuan due to the loose Hong Kong exchange rate. The supply of Hong Kong exchange was greater than the demand, and it fell slightly to 400 yuan and 420 yuan. Roby was available for sale at 525 yuan, but there was little demand. The US exchange rate was not changed, and designated banks were doing business at around 2,040 yuan.

### Wire Plants Have Raw Material Allocations Rayon Prices Fall

Yesterday, the rayon market was in a slump and continued to fall. The China Textile Company allocated 30th grade miscellaneous brand rayon at 1.12 million yuan to silk plants, and the market price followed suit. Yesterday, 120th grade Tianqiao with light opened at 1.32 million yuan, and then fell sharply, falling to a teaching plate of 1.27 million yuan, down 8,000 yuan from the previous day. The 120th grade miscellaneous brand with light was priced at 1.45 million yuan. The prices of other grades of goods were down 35,000 yuan. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson bought 50 bales of factory silk at 78% evenness for 2.35 million yuan. The asking price for ordinary user silk was about 50,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Five loads of Qianjing goods were transacted for 1.35 million yuan, with 10-day term notes. The supply and demand of wire goods were scarce. The market price was firm and generally not very popular, but Shenghang goods were slightly smaller.

### Yarn and Cotton Market Conditions Firm

Yesterday, the yarn market started high and ended flat. In the early morning, 42-count double-strand yarn took advantage of the previous day's rise, and Lanfeng once made a high of 116,000 yuan, but in the end, the Tianjin gang office was already saturated, and the same industry sold to make profits, gradually returning to 1.81 million yuan at the close. The prices of other yarns varied, but were generally similar to the above, with no major differences.

Yesterday, the New York American Cotton Telegraph reported a drop of 8 to 11 points, with the near-term price at US$27.50 and the far-term price at US$27.62. The current price of Mittling remained unchanged at US$28.16. The current cotton market conditions in this city are still firm, and transactions are still sustainable. Private yarn factories such as Jiaxin Fuan and Shenxin No. 5 Factory have all purchased cotton, but the Textile Building Company is still waiting and watching.

### Loan Results Have No News Rice Prices Still Refuse to Fall Yesterday They Rose Again by 2,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the rice market was firm, and merchants deliberately hoarded and raised prices, and the market was unanimously reported to be firm. Although it had slightly declined in the middle of the day, it was still raised by more than 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan due to the scarcity of goods. Among them, the most showy color was Yangxian early rice. The flour market was still flat, and soybeans and raw kernels were increased successively.

Additionally, the Hai Gui vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying over 2,700 pieces of tobacco from Qingdao. Yesterday, the sugar market showed no signs of improvement. The association lowered the price of medium-grade white granulated sugar by nearly 1,000 yuan to 57,000 yuan, with few transactions. Private firms offered ordinary goods at prices ranging from 46,000 to 45,000 yuan, while high-quality goods remained firm, still requiring over 50,000 yuan.

The recent orchid seed arrivals are of decent quality. Due to the current shortage, prices have risen by 5,000 yuan compared to before. Older and inferior qualities remain sluggish, with limited sales.

### Domestic Tea Sales Quite Active

Wenzhou, Zhejiang, is one of the earliest tea-producing regions in our country. According to investigations, this year's new tea has been on the market for nearly fifty days. Recently, large quantities of new tea continue to arrive in Shanghai from that area. However, the quality is gradually declining with each batch, leading to lower prices. Nevertheless, the buying interest remains strong. The demand for other varieties from Tianjin and Suzhou continues to increase. Sellers are quoting higher prices than before, causing the market to rise.

### United States Restricts Clock and Watch Imports; Switzerland Agrees

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] To protect the American clock and watch industry from Swiss competition, the government was asked to take protective measures.

It is believed that the U.S. government has asked Switzerland to further reduce the amount to around $5 million if necessary. However, due to the existing commercial treaty between the United States and Switzerland, the United States cannot unilaterally restrict the quantity of Swiss clock and watch imports.

### Cotton Fabric Market Turmoil Calms Down; Three-Industry Association Works to Adjust; Distribution Outlets Temporarily Suspend Activities; Expanding Institutional Rights Made Public

Negotiation Process

[Report from Our Newspaper] The cotton fabric market, which has been on strike for several days, will resume operations today, barring any further disruptions. Regarding the distribution issue of cotton fabrics from the China Textile Construction Corporation, a considerable understanding has been reached yesterday after negotiations between the Cotton Fabric, Cotton Yarn, and Dyeing & Weaving Three-Industry Association and the China Textile Construction Corporation. The details of the process are reported as follows:

The cotton fabric industry in this city was greatly angered by the establishment of distribution outlets by the China Textile Construction Corporation in collaboration with the "Three Great Xiang" businesses, due to the lack of transparency and the designation of the disputed surplus yarn and fabric as government supplies to be sold through public bidding. Thousands of fellow businesses gathered at the association daily, demanding that the association take responsibility to resolve the issue. The Cotton Fabric, Cotton Yarn, and Dyeing & Weaving Three-Industry Association dispatched representatives Pan Shihao, Dong Jiumei, Zhang Lisheng, Zhou Jiasheng, Jiang Zhaozu, Xi Shaosun, Yu Chongshan, Chen Jun, and others to meet with Dong Yuncao, General Manager, and Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager, of the China Textile Construction Corporation to discuss solutions at 11:00 AM yesterday. At 2:30 PM yesterday, the three associations hosted the Shanghai press at the Atlantic Restaurant, where Mr. Pan Shihao reported on the negotiation process, which resulted in three decisions:

1. Regarding the distribution outlet system, the industry expressed its support. However, in terms of organization, both parties should cooperate to improve it. The Cotton Fabric, Cotton Yarn, and Dyeing & Weaving associations will convene their members to nominate candidates and propose solutions to be submitted to the China Textile Construction Corporation for review and adoption. This will ensure the organization is transparent, the institution is expanded, that the business can be greatly promoted, and that the interests of the industry are universally considered. The distribution outlets already established by the "Three Great Xiang" will temporarily suspend activities and may be integrated into the larger organization promoted by the association in the future.

2. The surplus amount of yarn and fabric forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regime was originally intended to be distributed by the China Textile Construction Corporation. The three associations submitted a letter to the China Textile Construction Corporation expressing their profound grief. The China Textile Construction Corporation will forward it to the higher authorities for review. Distribution will be suspended until approval is granted.

3. Regarding the interview with General Manager Shu of the China Textile Construction Corporation published in the "China-America Evening Post" on the 8th, Manager Shu has firmly stated that he did not publish this interview and has sent a letter to the Cotton Fabric Association clarifying the truth. The representatives of the three associations expressed their understanding and requested that the China Textile Construction Corporation restrain its staff from making rash statements that are detrimental to the industry or untrue in the future, so as to avoid misunderstandings.

Industry Grievances

The industry side subsequently listed several points that the China Textile Construction Corporation should improve, such as: (1) Prices are not made public before the listing, and the product name and quantity are not specified during the listing. (2) The allocation of goods lacks standards and is unfair. (3) The listing and bidding time is too late, and the time to collect purchase requests is too short. (4) The delivery of warehouse receipts is often met with pickiness, and the delivery warehouses are often far apart, causing great inconvenience. (5) It is hoped that the China Textile Construction Corporation will shift its focus to expanding the international market and not compete with privately-owned yarn mills for profits. (6) It is hoped that the China Textile Construction Corporation will improve its sales plan.

Authority's Response

The reporter then visited Mr. Shu Yunzhang, Manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation, to inquire about the many questions raised by various sectors regarding the company. He replied: The company's plan for distribution outlets is based on the principle of transparency. Therefore, the company is willing to consider entrusting distribution to those with strong sales capabilities, reliable credit, suitable locations, and strong financial resources. However, he stated that the company does not currently intend to establish many distribution outlets. In principle, the distribution contracts signed with the "Three Great Xiang" cannot be arbitrarily cancelled due to opposition from third parties. However, if the "Three Great Xiang" do not fulfill the contract, the company can only forgive them. It is said that the results of the company's past entrustment to associations were not entirely satisfactory. Therefore, it does not seem appropriate for the association to organize a distribution mechanism. The reason for the late opening price by the China Textile Construction Corporation is to make the price of goods opened by the China Textile Construction Corporation lower than the market price. As for the amount of inventory, this is a common secret of the yarn mills and cannot be easily disclosed. The allocation problem is due to the different types and quantities of products produced by the company, which cannot always match the needs of various sectors. However, there are still standards in unavoidable situations, such as: weaving factories have priority in allocating yarn, followed by yarn shops, etc. Dyeing and weaving factories have priority in allocating fabrics, followed by local fabric stores, and then out-of-town merchants, etc. The China Textile Construction Corporation's burden of paying taxes and interest on loans borrowed from national institutions is no different from that of privately-owned yarn mills. Even the current loan of 33 million US dollars in American cotton is allocated proportionally according to the number of spindles in each factory. Furthermore, the company's future business development will be expanded to the international market. However, the current domestic market supply and sales are still insufficient, so there is no question of exporting. It is not intended to compete with privately-owned yarn mills in the domestic market.

Association's Statement

Regarding the association, according to Mr. Pan Shihao, the cotton fabric industry has had a dispute due to the China Textile Construction Corporation signing a distribution contract with the "Three Great Xiang," resulting in a strike for many days. The association is responsible for resolving the situation and can resolve it according to normal procedures. However, we must know that the yarn and fabric factories have long been heartbroken since the yarn and fabric were forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regime and the government refused to return the surplus. The emergence of the China Textile Construction Corporation as a state-owned enterprise is an innovation. Although the organizers of procedures such as opening and distributing goods also know to earnestly improve, they have already caused many misunderstandings on weekdays. The signing of distribution contracts with a very small number of businesses, and the failure of the distributors to accommodate industry cooperation, will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among the industry and affect the China Textile Construction Corporation's business. This person is one of the responsible persons for the cotton fabric and dyeing & weaving industries. When the China Textile Construction Corporation was first established, this person had suggested to the authorities along with the yarn shops that the association promote and organize an open assistance mechanism. Although it was not adopted, the purpose has never changed. At noon on the 9th, representatives of the three associations visited Mr. Shu, General Manager, and Mr. Wu, Deputy General Manager, in charge of the China Textile Construction Corporation to discuss the matter. This principle has been approved. The association will convene members to discuss organizational methods. This person must handle it impartially to resolve this dispute. The distribution outlets run by the "Three Great Xiang" have temporarily suspended activities, and there should be no harm to the industry. As for the yarn and fabric transferred by the puppet merchant association, it is the surplus amount that the enemy and puppet regime forcibly purchased from domestic factories. According to law and the industry's rights, it is necessary to strongly advocate to the government. The China Textile Construction Corporation is entrusted to sell it this time. Although there are unavoidable reasons for this in administration, it is truly intolerable for the industry. Appropriately, the dispute over the distribution outlet has occurred, and the resentment is inevitable. This person has already discussed with the China Textile Construction Corporation authorities to report the situation to the higher authorities and stop the sale. If it is allowed by the competent authorities, then what cannot be discussed in the future for official-business cooperation.

### Diverting the Yellow River to its Old Course and Building Embankments: Turning Water Calamity into Water Conservancy

— Special Dispatch from Jinan, 5th Day — Sent by Meng Ming

The Zhengzhou embankment restoration and closure project has already commenced, and the Yellow River is being diverted and defenses are being restored. It is expected that the eight years of flooding will soon be a thing of the past. However, the problems of the Yellow River are not easily eradicated. The plan to control the Yellow River relies on thorough and careful consideration. Mr. Yang Mengming has always held insightful views on the issue of river management. Recently, he specially wrote this manuscript. Its main aim is to explain that the only way to manage the Yellow River is to change its course, and advocates for jointly managing the Yellow and Huai rivers, so that ships from the sea can directly reach Xi'an, transforming water disasters into water conservancy. This proposal is worthy of study and reference by the authorities. — (Editor)

Rivers originate from the same source. Since the beginning of history, the Yangtze River has benefited the country for thousands of years, while the Yellow River has harmed China for thousands of years. The reason why rivers from the same source have different benefits and harms lies in the different regions they pass through, and the degree to which they carry sediment and become turbid. The Yangtze River carries less sediment, which does not hinder navigation. The Yellow River carries too much sediment, causing siltation in the lower reaches and severe river problems. Therefore, to solve the problems of the Yellow River, its course should be changed to reduce sediment content, making it similar to the Yangtze River. In this way, the Yellow River will bring immeasurable benefits to China. Thus, changing the course of the Yellow River is the prerequisite for managing it.

Prerequisites for Managing the Yellow River

It has long been said that one *dan* of Yellow River water contains six *dou* of mud. However, whether the Yellow River's sediment originates from the Qin *long* region or the Central Plains has been debated by scholars in the past, but it can be studied practically. After the Yellow River passes through Lanzhou, its water becomes turbid. When it leaves the frontier and approaches the loess region of the desert, the soil is loose and the sand is floating, making it easily eroded by water. Therefore, this section should be considered the source of the Yellow River's sediment. Between the mountains of Shanxi and Shaanxi, the cliffs are high and the river flows swiftly and turbulently, making it a powerful area for mud and sand transportation. From Tongguan to Yingze, there are many mountains and the soil is firm, and the water flows underground, so this section is acceptable. Within the borders of Kaifeng, floating sand is everywhere, embankments are not solid, and the river flows rapidly. Once it breaches, it can expand hundreds of *zhang* in an instant, making it the root of river problems in previous generations. Therefore, to fundamentally solve the problem, the course of the Yellow River must be shifted to a new channel, in order to avoid the sandy areas of the frontier and Kaifeng. In this way, the Yellow River will carry as little sediment as possible, and can bring benefits like the Yangtze River. However, since water flows on the ground, it is impossible to ensure that it carries no sediment at all; one can only try to reduce it as much as possible. In addition to changing the river course and avoiding sandy areas as mentioned above, it is also necessary to consider how to prevent the water from carrying sediment in the upper reaches, and how to ensure that the sediment in the water is carried into the sea in the lower reaches, without settling midway.

To reduce sediment in the upper reaches, the river flow must be slowed down. To slow down the river flow, the riverbed must be level and not too high or too low. Only then can the water flow smoothly over it, preventing it from stirring up sediment. Therefore, the guiding and management of the upper reaches of the Yellow River should be based on the principle of gentle and smooth flow. The problem in the lower reaches is breaching. The cause of breaching is siltation. The reason for siltation is that the river suddenly widens, the water flow becomes slow and stagnant, and the sediment in the water has a chance to settle. The sediment settles at the bottom of the river, raising the riverbed. When the bottom is high, the water is high, and breaching occurs naturally. Therefore, the solution to the problems of the lower reaches lies in removing silt and preventing breaching, allowing the water to flow underground so that the sediment has no chance to settle and cause frequent breaching, and ensuring that the river flows smoothly and directly into the sea. Thus, the upper reaches use the method of gentle and smooth flow to reduce sediment, while the lower reaches use the method of smooth and direct flow to discharge sediment. Although it is one river, the management methods for the upper and lower reaches are completely different.

Water conservancy and perpetual writing cannot coexist; without water conservancy, there will inevitably be water disasters. Therefore, managing the Yellow River is not only about passively eliminating water disasters, but also about actively developing water conservancy. There are two aspects to water conservancy: benefiting irrigation and aiding navigation. Shaanxi and Gansu are located in the center of China and were once known as the Land of Abundance. The Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties established their capitals there, and culture and civilization flourished. Later, due to the trampling of nomadic peoples, industry declined and people were displaced. However, water conservancy in the Northwest dates back to ancient times, and traces of the Qin and Han dynasties can still be found. Although the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui are known as water regions, water disasters are greater than water conservancy. It is imperative to take advantage of this opportunity to manage the Yellow River, make overall plans, and utilize water conservancy to develop the country's industry. The Northwest is barren and bitter, but the treasures of the Northwest are boundless. Developing the Northwest is a key plan for building China, requiring the absorption of foreign materials for development and the export of Northwest goods to boost commerce. The Longhai Railway line is difficult to handle the demand. Now, while managing the Yellow River, it is essential to make the Yellow River and the sea navigable to supplement the Longhai Railway's limitations, increase transportation capacity, and promote the great cause of construction.

Discussion on the Upper Reaches of the River Course

The Yellow River originates in Qinghai, crosses Gansu, and flows north into the desert, forming the Hetao region. Then, it enters the Central Plains, where its flow becomes turbid and it breaches and floods, with no peaceful years. Throughout history, there have been countless records of Yellow River management, but no fundamental solutions have been found, causing problems for thousands of years. As the ancients said, there have been efforts to partially remedy the situation, but no permanent solutions. I have often studied and pondered that the most important thing for fundamentally solving the problem is to change the river course. Guide the Yellow River eastward from Lanzhou, pass through the Niaoshu Mountains, and join the Wei River to flow eastward to Tongguan, where it rejoins its old course. This would avoid the drifting sands of Inner Mongolia and the turbulent flow of Shanxi and Shaanxi. The Yellow River would leave the desert loess region and the steep valleys of Shanxi and Shaanxi, and take a new course through a relatively flat and less sandy area. The river water would flow peacefully and gently, without being turbulent or forceful, and with less scouring. The sediment in the water would naturally decrease. After entering the Central Plains, there would be less risk of siltation. The problems caused by the Yellow River would be mitigated, and the gentle river flow would benefit irrigation and navigation.

The Ningxia Ten Canals have a long history, and the Hetao region is the most fertile in the entire river basin. Along with the newly opened Sato Minsheng Canal, they all rely on the water of the Yellow River and benefit from irrigation. Therefore, even if the Yellow River is diverted to a new course, the old courses in Ningxia and Suiyuan should not be abandoned. A sluice gate should be built near Lanzhou to control the opening and closing, providing sufficient water for irrigation in the old course, and forming a canal with sluice locks to maintain the water level. The remaining water should follow the new river and flow eastward, joining the Wei River to form the main stream of the upper Yellow River.

Discussion on River Works in the Upper Reaches

As the Yangtze River flows eastward, it breaks through the Three Gorges and reaches the plains; as the Qin River flows southward, it emerges from the Taihang Mountains and joins the Yellow River. Mountains have peaks and ridges, as well as valleys and ravines. Mount Wu and the Taihang Mountains are not short or small. However, the Yangtze River and the Qin River seek out valleys and find gaps to emerge, forming large rivers. Therefore, it is regrettable that the Yellow River is blocked by the Niaoshu Mountains and cannot flow eastward. However, the Niaoshu Mountains cannot be without valleys, but the valleys are mixed with hills, creating obstacles that cannot be overcome. The Yellow River is forced to flow north, far into the barren desert, carrying sediment southward, turning water conservancy into water disaster. However, there are many precedents for mankind overcoming nature. Zhang An, a man of the Han dynasty, opened the 500-*li* Li Xie Road, cutting through more than 100 *li* of mountains and slopes to enter the depths of the Mian River and the Xie River of the Wei River, connecting the waterways of Qin and Long. Even with such rudimentary engineering knowledge, the ancients achieved so much. Today's capabilities have long surpassed those of the ancients. Moreover, to eliminate endless water disasters for the country, even if the project is huge, how can we be afraid of difficulties? Knowing is difficult, but doing is not. Therefore, opening the waterway through the Niaoshu Mountains and diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River must be resolutely implemented without hesitation. A detailed search of the terrain should be conducted to determine the lowest points and the location of valleys, whether the valleys are connected to each other, and where the hills between the valleys are the smallest and lowest and easiest to excavate. All of this should be investigated to find economical and cost-effective construction methods. If the terrain is slightly high, a tunnel can be excavated to allow the water to flow through it. The Longhai Railway has opened many tunnels in western Henan. To save costs, tunnels can also be used for the river channel. If the terrain descends in stages, it is possible to create several tiered structures so that the water flows through them, creating waterfalls everywhere. The water power can be used to build hydroelectric power plants, making the area the power center of the Northwest.

The mountains of Shaanxi and Gansu are intertwined, and the Wei River also has river valleys and shoals, but they are flatter than those in Shanxi and Shaanxi. To maintain the principle of gentle and smooth flow, the shoals in the river should be dredged, and rocks should be blasted. Where the river valley is low, it should be filled with crushed stone to make the riverbed level. Then, the riverbed in the upper reaches will have no great differences, and the river flow will naturally be stable, in accordance with the principle of gentle and smooth flow, with no force to scour sediment, and will not cause harm to the lower reaches. Embankments should be built on both sides of the river where necessary to constrain the water, or sluice gates should be installed where the terrain suddenly drops, to maintain the water level, benefiting navigation and irrigation. After all the projects on the new course are properly completed, the Yellow River should be diverted into the Wei River (the new course), with a long and ample water source, bringing even greater benefits.

The most important consideration for river defense is the flood season in late summer and autumn. The floods in late summer and autumn are usually caused by the melting of accumulated ice and snow in the deep mountains and valleys of Qin, Long, and Qing Ning after the summer rains. The tributaries and small streams all rush into the river, so that during the late summer and autumn season, the water level can rise by several *zhang* in a single day. If it cannot be discharged in time, breaching will occur. The high water level carries a large amount of sediment. Therefore, to reduce sediment and suppress floods, efforts must be made from each water source. The ancients said that water is harmful if abandoned, but beneficial if used. Therefore, to avoid harm and obtain benefits, one must find ways to use water. The method of using water relies on promoting irrigation. Irrigation work can store water. Based on the needs of the fields, the will of the people determines the amount of water used for irrigation. The promoter is managing the amount of water with human intention. If irrigation work can be widely implemented, the water of springs and rivers will be controlled by people, driven to irrigate, and prevented from flowing rapidly, reducing sediment and suppressing floods without being aware of it. Increasing irrigation can reduce sediment. The two are mutually cause and effect, and the work of reducing sediment and suppressing floods can achieve perfection.

Irrigation is beneficial to managing the Yellow River, so irrigation work can also be regarded as part of the Yellow River management project. Larger irrigation projects, such as opening canals and building embankments, require a lot of funds and can be undertaken by the state. The government can supervise and guide people to carry out other smaller projects. After ten years, the benefits will be significant. The following is a record of several matters related to irrigation:

(A) River Channels, Ditches, and Furrows

Canal works in the Northwest have been started, or completed. The benefits of expanding canal works are boundless. River channels are the main arteries for irrigating fields, and the ditches and furrows that extend from them reach the fields. Ditches and furrows dug in the fields are connected vertically and accumulate water, with varying depths. During the summer and autumn floods, they drain water for irrigation. Rivers do not overflow, and fields have no drought. During the winter and spring droughts, they are dredged for fertilizer and soil treatment. They make thin soil thick and shallow soil deep. Soil fertilized with river mud can withstand drought and cultivate seedlings, increasing harvests. River mud is very effective as fertilizer, so it is necessary to maintain the benefits of ditches and furrows. Everyone understands the benefits of ditches and furrows, but the main obstacle to implementing them is the private ownership of land. Landowners are most distressed by giving up their private land to open ditches and furrows to benefit others. Now that the Land Law has been formulated, farmers own their land, which is an immutable truth. If the method of ditches and furrows is promoted, and private land is occupied, the land of large landowners will be requisitioned in accordance with the law, and the land of small farmers will be exchanged for the land of large landowners to return it. After the ditches and furrows are opened, the harvest will double. Ten *mu* of land can yield dozens of *mu* of grain. Although large landowners give up a small amount of land to compensate small farmers, they suffer no actual loss as their harvest increases.

(B) Stone Banks and Ponds

There are three sources of water: snowmelt, rainwater, and spring water. Snowmelt is the highest, spring water is the second highest, and rainwater can be found at all elevations. Water from higher elevations flows thinly, and as it flows down, it converges and merges, becoming more abundant. Thin streams are mostly found in the mountains. The elevation of the mountain should be carefully examined, and rocks should be gathered to build stone banks, step by step, determining the density according to the mountain's slope. The water will flow forward after filling, moving from one bank to the next. Not only will this slow down the water flow, but the water from the stone banks can also be used to irrigate fields on the plateau. Where the water flow is large and abundant, embankments should be built to create ponds, ranging from a few *li* to dozens or hundreds of *li* in circumference, depending on the terrain and water volume. Water gates should be built to store and release water as needed. When the river water rises, open the high gates to receive the water, allowing it to flow into the ponds. When the river is calm and the ponds are full, close the gates to store the water. In times of drought, open the lower gates to release the water, channeling it through ditches and furrows to the fields, and then slowly releasing it into the river. This transforms the violent flow into a tranquil stream. Therefore, ponds in the fields are like banks in the market, and their impact on prosperity and decline cannot be ignored. The Shaobei Pond in Shouchun is an excellent example from ancient times. Today, the Northwest is barren, and the people are poor, and the water conservancy is undeveloped. In ancient times, when Yu divided the world into nine provinces, Yong was the highest ranked. It is said that this was because Yu devoted his efforts to canals and ponds. Therefore, today when managing the Yellow River, one should seek solutions in canals and ponds in addition to managing the river channel.

Outside the city of Xiangcheng in Henan, there is the Shahe River. One summer, the water rose during the flood season, rising several *zhang*, with only three boards (of the city wall) preventing the city from being submerged. The water did not recede until after ten days. Henan has suffered from severe droughts for years. If such water could be stored by building ponds, how much land could be irrigated?

(C) Releasing Silt

People in Shandong have a saying: "The Yellow River does not leave behind a bad name." The saying means that when the Yellow River breaches, silt will inevitably follow. After the water recedes and planting begins, a bumper harvest is guaranteed. One year's harvest can equal two years' worth of grain. This is a folk song praising the richness of the Yellow River's silt. Therefore, the silt of the Yellow River should be utilized. There are many large valleys in Gansu and Shaanxi. It is said that some valleys in northern Shaanxi are tens of *li* deep and wide, taking a whole day to cross. For all the old and new Yellow Rivers and other major rivers, such as the Qin, Fen, Wei, and Luo Rivers, if there are large valleys on both sides, a water gate should be opened upstream of the river to release water into the valley. After the sediment settles and the valley water becomes clear, a gate should be opened downstream to return the water to the river. After several releases, farmland can be formed. The ponds mentioned in the previous section, which store water for many years, will also become fertile fields. The ponds must be converted into fields, and the location of the ponds must be shifted to maximize land use. Also, in autumn and winter, when the Yellow River has shallow water, water can be released to increase the flow of the main stream, which will benefit boats.

It is important to promote the construction of embankments on the edges of fields in various parts of the Northwest, which is also a key step in reducing sediment and preventing siltation. The soil in the Northwest is loose, and wind blows sand, flying all over the sky. Heavy rain washes away mud, causing runoff everywhere. The fields are the source of mud and sand. If small embankments are built around the fields, rainwater will accumulate in the fields and will not flow away immediately. The fields can absorb as much water as possible, reaching a saturation point above which they can maintain moisture for a long time and resist drought. The floating sand in the fields will also be bound together and will not be washed into the river. Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces often suffer severe droughts, and the rivers in these provinces mostly flow into the Yellow River. Therefore, irrigation plans should be carried out simultaneously in Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu to achieve the effects of reducing sediment and fertilizing the fields.

Discussion on the Lower Reaches of the River Course

The lower reaches of the Yellow River should abandon the line from Lanfeng to Lijin and use the new river from Zhongmu to Huaiyin. The favorable conditions are as follows: (1) The old course has been silted up for many years, and the riverbed is several *zhang* higher than the surrounding land, making it prone to river problems. To deepen the riverbed to make the water flow underground, the engineering work would be equivalent to digging two rivers, which is not economical. (2) In addition to disaster prevention, the purpose of this river management is to make the entire river navigable. The Lijin estuary is located deep in the Bohai Bay, and communication with the ocean requires bypassing the Shandong Peninsula. The road is long and winding, which increases the shipping distance, delays the delivery of goods, and violates economic principles. The estuary east of Huaiyin is directly on the coast of the ocean, making the route short and convenient, similar to Shanghai. In terms of navigation, the new course is superior to the old course. (3) Managing the Yellow River and the Huai River together is a win-win situation. The Huai River carries the water of seventy-two mountains and flows from Henan and Anhui into Jiangsu. Since the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, the lower reaches have been seized by the Yellow River, blocking the eastward route. The water accumulates in Hongze Lake, causing depression and frequent water disasters. The entire Huai River has not been fully managed. Now, we should take advantage of the Yellow River management to manage both the Yellow River and the Huai River. Since the breach at Zhongmu, the Yellow River has seized the Huai River. At this time, managing the Yellow River is managing the Huai River, and managing the Huai River is managing the Yellow River. The Huai River is clear, and the Yellow River is turbid. Use the clear water of the Huai River to flush the turbid water of the Yellow River. The shallower parts of the river should be flushed to make them deeper. Pan Yinchuan of the Ming dynasty implemented this for many years with remarkable results. River management experts in the Qing dynasty all followed his wisdom. However, at that time, borrowing the Huai River to flush the Yellow River was only done in the section from Huaiyin to the sea. Now, all sections below the Yi and Ying rivers can use the Huai River to flush the Yellow River. Moreover, the Yellow River has been diverted in the upper reaches, reducing the amount of sediment in the water. The Grand Canal has stopped transporting goods, so river management no longer needs to accommodate transportation. The mutual aid of the Huai and Yellow Rivers will ensure greater tranquility. Furthermore, the embankments of the Yellow River began in Rongze, Henan. East of Rongze, there began to be the problem of breaching. The Huai River originates in Tongbai and flows through southern Henan. Its water is clear and not turbid. Now the new course of the Yellow River turns southeast from Zhongmu, running parallel to the Huai River, and joining it at Yingshang. Examining the soil, the soil through which the two rivers flow in southern Henan is roughly the same. The fact that the water of the Huai River is clear proves that the Yellow River is also not turbid. Therefore, the Yellow River has been diverted, using the Wei River in the upper reaches to avoid sediment, and using the Huai River in the lower reaches to flush sediment. To ensure the long-term stability of the Yellow River, there is no easier way than to change its course.

Discussion on River Works in the Lower Reaches

The ancients said that if the river water is rapid, it will scour and clear the channel, but if it is slow, it will stagnate and silt up. Therefore, using the power of water to manage water is smooth and easy. Using water to attack sand will deepen the river without dredging. This statement profoundly captures the essence of guiding and managing the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Therefore, the management method for the lower reaches is smooth and direct flow. The upper reaches of the Yellow River are held between mountains, carrying mud and sand. East of Rongze, the river expands, and the riverbed becomes flat and wide. The flow is slow and stagnant, and the sediment gradually settles, raising the riverbed. It is difficult for embankments to constrain the water, and river problems arise. Therefore, the best way to solve the problems in the lower reaches of the Yellow River is to make the river flow smoothly and directly. Smooth means not competing with the water for land and not allowing the river to widen. The width of the river channel should be uniform, so that the river flow is not too turbulent or too stagnant, and the flow rate remains uniform, flowing into the sea in one breath, with no chance for sediment to settle. In this way, the river will flow underground, bringing benefits like the Yangtze River, with no risk of flooding. Direct flow means following the nature of the water and making the water flow straight from top to bottom. If limited by the terrain, large arc-shaped bends should be made, so that the water flow does not turn sharply, creating turbulence, scouring the banks, and causing sediment to accumulate, leading to breaching.

Managing the lower reaches of the Yellow River is actually an extension of the Huai River management project. Even if the Yellow River is not managed, the Huai River must be managed. Managing the Yellow River and the Huai River together is a win-win situation, saving the country a lot of money. Before construction begins in the lower reaches, the breach in the middle should be closed, allowing the water to flow through the old course, and the new course should be dried, making construction easier. After the entire new river is completed, the water should be released into the new river to celebrate peace. The construction steps can be divided into three sections:

The first section is from the estuary to Xuyi

(The appropriate location is near Shuanggou Town, north of Xuyi) Before construction begins on this section, a canal should be opened from Xuyi to Jiangdu (named the West Canal), drawing water from Hongze, Baoying, and Shaobo lakes into the Yangtze River. The water coming from the east of the Huai River can also find a way out through this canal. Then, a large dam should be built to prevent the Huai River from flowing east, and all the old openings in the North-South Grand Canal should be blocked, so that the river channel dries up and can be surveyed and measured at will. The depth and width of the river channel should be uniform, and the capacity of the river channel should be able to accommodate the combined floods of the Yellow River and the Huai River. The excavated soil should be piled on both sides of the river to create gentle slopes, so that when the river water rises, it will flow smoothly up the slopes, and when the water recedes, it will shrink back down smoothly, avoiding the steep embankments that are easily eroded and collapse. Jin Fu implemented this method with great success. After the river channel is completed, the dam should be opened, allowing the water to flow into the river and return to the sea. Ports should be built on both sides of the estuary, which would be designated as commercial ports to facilitate the berthing of large ships and the handling of goods. In accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, a long dike should be built from the estuary directly into the sea. The Yellow River will carry sediment, which will settle outside the dike, ensuring that the estuary remains unobstructed. After several years, the coast of Jiangsu will extend hundreds of *li* into the sea, naturally expanding the territory.

The second section is from Xuyi to Fengtai

This section is entirely the main course of the Huai River. It has a vast water flow throughout the year, making it difficult to excavate. The river flows underground, and the river channel is deep. However, after the Yellow River's flow is added, the Huai River cannot accommodate it. It is necessary to calculate the water volume of the two rivers and estimate the river's capacity. Another water diversion river should be opened beside the Huai River, so that the combined capacity of the water diversion river and the Huai River is sufficient to accommodate the Huai and Yellow Rivers flowing together. Slowly scour the river so that it naturally merges into one river. Gentle slopes should be built on both sides of the river, following the method of the first section, to provide defense. The Huai River in Anhui Province sometimes floods, causing severe damage. Floods were rare in the Tang Dynasty, but floods in the Huai River were severe, perhaps because the terrain in Anhui Province is low. To prevent floods in the Huai River and simultaneous floods in the Huai and Yellow Rivers, heavy embankments can be built in low-lying areas for safety.

The third section is from Fengtai to Zhongmu. This section inherits the main course of the Yellow River from Zhongmu and connects to the vast waves of the Huai River in the lower reaches. Expand and enlarge it by comparing it to the methods of the first and second sections. The work of changing the course of the lower reaches is completed here. Straighten the curved parts of the river channel to facilitate navigation between Henan and Anhui. Zhengzhou, Zhoujiakou, Fuyang, and Bengbu will be no different from Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, and Wuhu.

Since the beginning of history, the Yellow River has been a problem for China. This thorough management is intended for long-term stability. The embankments on both sides are the result of the hard work of many compatriots, so attention should be paid to defense and repair at all times, without any damage, to avoid further river problems. Therefore, a permanent and fixed plan should be established for defense and repair, so that it can be maintained and never abandoned. River management requires the labor of the people, and river defense is also inseparable from the labor of the people. Gentle slopes should be built on both sides of the Yellow River. The slope facing the river can be densely planted with willows and grass roots. With dense willows and lush grass, the riverbank will become stronger, and the slope will be safe, and river defense will be naturally consolidated. The inner side of the slope is flatter and can be planted with grains. The benefits of the slope are numerous. The river management authorities can allocate the land of the slope to the soldiers and laborers participating in the river works free of charge, planting fields and trees. They will be happy to go. Distribute land according to population, and then make them river defense *baojia*. Sell their labor to repair the slopes, without having to pay wages, achieving two goals at once. On top of the slopes on both sides, following the railway method, small stone monuments should be erected at equal distances, with the kilometer number counting upwards from the estuary inscribed on them. When patrolling the river embankments, patrol personnel can record the number of the stone monument if they encounter low embankments or embankments that are not up to standard and notify the relevant *baojia* to repair them, which is very convenient. Repairing small damages immediately can avoid major projects.

### Yellow River Survey

— Special Correspondent He Bingru, Reporting by Airmail from Jinan on the 1st

The Yellow River originates in Qinghai. From Hetao (河套) downstream, the river carries mud and sand, surging turbulently until it enters the sea at Lijin, passing through the provinces of Hebei (冀), Henan (豫), and Shandong (魯). Along the river, every section of embankment is considered a dangerous point. Each breach results in immense and devastating harm, causing long-term problems. Since the Japanese invasion, the Yellow River breached at Zhongmou County (中牟縣) in Henan Province, causing extensive flooding that lasted for years without being repaired. A section of the old Yellow River course in Shandong Province has almost dried up, and the benefits of past navigation by boats and junks can no longer be seen. Now, at a time of victory and national reconstruction, the Yellow River has become a major issue for our country. The project of closing the breach, restoring the dikes, and diverting the river back to its old course is being closely watched by the world.

Zhao Shouyu (趙守鈺), Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (黃河水利委員會), and others met in Kaifeng last month with Communist Party representatives Chao Zhefu (晁哲夫), Jia Xinqi (賈心齊), Zhao Mingfu (趙明甫), United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) representatives Van Haining Tarde (范海寗塔德), Dickens (迭更司), Hansen Van Mingde (漢生范銘德), American advisors, Ma Jie (馬傑), Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Qi Zhenru (齊眞如) of the Henan Provincial Government (represented by Pei Yinde 參議裴蔭德代), Liu Jixue (劉積學), representative of the Provincial Assembly (參議會代表), and others, to discuss concrete implementation methods. Based on the joint resolutions of all parties, the Yellow River Survey Team was formed, consisting of Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Tao Shuzeng (陶述曾), Chief Engineer, Zuo Qipeng (左起彭), Deputy Director of the Engineering Department, Qiu Songyan (邱松岩), Director of the General Affairs Department, Kong Linglian (孔令聯), Director of Shandong Embankment Repair Department, American advisors Tarde, Van Mingde, Hansen, and Communist Party representatives Zhao Mingfu, Cheng Run (成潤), and others. On the 8th of this month, they departed from Kaifeng to conduct an on-site survey of the extent of damage to the embankment defenses and the degree of siltation of the riverbed downstream from Huayuankou (花闖口), aiming to advance the work of closing the breach and restoring the dikes simultaneously. They conducted an on-site survey along the south bank of the main dike and stayed overnight in the western part of Heze County (荷擇縣). On the 9th, they proceeded to Shilibu (十裏堡) in Dongping County (東平縣), and at 5:00 PM on the 10th, they arrived in Jinan and stayed at the Shengli (Victory) Hotel. He Siyuan (何思源), Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Yan Guofu (延國符), Director of the Qing Relief Sub-Administration, and others visited them at the hotel. At 6:00 AM on the 11th, the team left Jinan and headed east, following the north bank of the Yellow River downstream via Luokou (洛口), arriving in Lijin (利津) that evening. At 5:30 AM on the 12th, they crossed the river from Lijin and proceeded west along the south bank, arriving back in Jinan that evening. On the 13th, Chairman He Siyuan of Shandong hosted a banquet for the Chinese and foreign members of the team at his private residence. On the 14th, they left Jinan and returned to Kaifeng, surveying the north bank dike along the way. Regarding the section from Lijin downstream to the river mouth, which has not been flowed through for a long time, in order to ensure smooth and unobstructed drainage of the entire river in the future, it should also be dredged. Chief Engineer Tao Shuzeng and Kong Lingrong (孔令瑢), Director of the Shandong Embankment Repair Department, were left behind to conduct a detailed survey in Lijin. According to their conversations during their first visit to Jinan, they mainly discussed the proceedings of the repeated meetings in Kaifeng and the situation of their on-site surveys along the banks after leaving Kaifeng. According to what the reporter has learned, the Communist Party representatives raised three points at the meeting:

(1) They advocated for the simultaneous advancement of the breach closure and dike restoration projects, hoping to close the breach only after the downstream dikes were fully restored to prevent downstream flooding.

(2) There are approximately 1,500 old villages and over 200 newly built villages inhabited by residents between the western dike and the Yellow River in the section from Changyuan (長垣) to Jinan. Before the Yellow River returns to its old course, measures should be taken to provide relief to the villagers' livelihoods.

(3) Regarding the organizational structure for river management, they hoped that it would be carried out jointly by both the Nationalist and Communist parties, based on the principle of unified cooperation.

After discussion, the principles were agreed upon, and all the details would be negotiated separately. At the same time, the Henan Provincial Government also raised four points:

(1) They hoped that the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan could simultaneously advance and expedite the breach closure and dike restoration projects.

(2) There is a shortage of building materials needed to close the breach, and they hoped that other materials could be used as substitutes. They wanted to expand the area for purchasing materials.

(3) (This seems to be missing from the source text)

(4) They hoped to increase the purchase price of materials. There were many other proposals, which were then discussed and resolved. Regarding the construction sequence for closing the breach and restoring the dikes, it was decided to proceed simultaneously. However, the date for closing the breach at Huayuankou would depend on the survey of the downstream river channel's siltation and damage, as well as the estimated size of the dike restoration project. Regarding the project plans for the workers, if it was necessary to pass through the Communist Party's defense zone, the Communist Party would issue supporting documents and provide facilitation and assistance in the work. Regarding the organization of the construction organization, it should be based on the principle of unified cooperation, with personnel from both sides participating in the direct undertaking of the construction organization for the breach closure and dike restoration projects. Regarding issues of labor recruitment, material procurement, transportation, and wage disbursement, it was decided to use work as relief, expand the procurement area, increase the value of labor and materials, provide each person with two and a half catties of food per day, and supplement it with wages. Regarding the issue of relocating and providing relief to villages within the riverbed, it was decided that the Yellow River Conservancy Commission would prepare a budget proposal for the relocation expenses of the people in the entire riverbed village and submit it to the central government for approval, while Director Ma Jie of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and Mr. Van Haining would apply for relief from the UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The Communist Party representatives would inform the local governments of the Communist Party-controlled river sections to devise relief measures, which would be further discussed after on-site inspection based on actual needs. As for the survey situation from Kaifeng to Jinan, the main dike was generally intact, but the civilian embankments were more severely damaged, and the stone materials from the river dams had been almost completely stolen. The riverbed had some siltation, the largest being about two "gongcun" (公寸, ~6.6 cm), and the rest being over one "gongcun" (~3.3 cm). It was decided to adopt a fundamental solution to straighten the river channel by cutting through bends, eliminating the dangerous sections downstream. As for the section from Jinan to Lijin, about 20-30% of the dikes on both banks were damaged, but most were still intact.

### On the Eve of the National Industrial Cooperatives Design Committee Meeting: A Look at the Past and Present of the Northwest Industrial Cooperatives

— Special Correspondent Bingzi, Reporting by Airmail from Lanzhou on the 1st

The Industrial Cooperatives movement in the Northwest has gradually attracted the attention of the general public. From its beginning to the present, it has laid a preliminary foundation through eight years of arduous struggle. Although there is great hope for the future, it still requires the greatest effort.

After the China Industrial Cooperatives Association (中國工業合作協會) was established in Hankou in the autumn of 1938, it set up the Baoji (寳鷄) District Office to coordinate the development of the Northwest "Industrial Cooperatives." This emerging enterprise was well-suited to the needs of the War of Resistance. More than 300 industrial production cooperatives were established in the Northwest region, with a total of 4,000 members. They were based in 15 locations, including Baoji, Xi'an, Fengxiang, Jianlin, Ankang, Shuangshipu, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Long County, Pingliang, Minxian, Luoyang, Laohekou, Zhenping, and the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi, engaging in rear-area production work. Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi focused on cotton textiles, while Gansu Province focused on wool textiles. In addition, there were also leather, machinery, and chemical products.

Due to the battles in southern Henan and the Zhongtiao Mountains, and due to financial difficulties, the "Industrial Cooperatives," like other industries, were significantly affected. Now, only about 100 cooperatives are operating, with approximately 1,000 members. However, the people in charge of the Industrial Cooperatives and the members have gained valuable experience in extremely difficult circumstances. Regarding its contribution to the War of Resistance, the production of military blankets alone, in Baoji, Xi'an, Tianshui, Lanzhou, Jianlin, and five other locations, exceeded 1.5 million. This figure also represents the achievements of the Industrial Cooperatives in the Northwest.

The two "Peili Schools" for cultivating talent for the National Industrial Cooperatives are located in Gansu, one in Lanzhou and one in Shandan. The former was founded in 1942, and the latter was moved from Shuangshipu. The two schools have a total of more than 200 students, all recruited from poor rural families, using a work-study system to train students to use both their hands and brains. The current curriculum is divided into three categories: machinery, textiles, and chemistry. After completing the four-year curriculum, there is also a one-year internship. These two schools, which cultivate future cadres for the Industrial Cooperatives, have been valued by the United Kingdom and the United States. Last year, the United Kingdom and the United States donated 1 billion yuan to the China Industrial Cooperatives, and a quarter of that was allocated to these two schools. It is said that new American machinery to help the two schools will also be shipped this autumn, and two Americans will come to provide technical guidance.

The Industrial Cooperatives is a socio-economic movement, completely different from large-capital industry. Generally, private-capital industries are aimed at making profits, while the Industrial Cooperatives is on the path to establishing an industrial base. Our country needs industrialization, and the new democratic era to be implemented in the future needs to establish a foundation for mass economy. Targeting this goal, the Northwest Industrial Cooperatives emphasizes the establishment of rural industries, and will gradually develop in small and medium-sized towns with industrial conditions. It has also prepared a plan and elected representatives to submit it to the National Industrial Cooperatives Design Committee meeting to be held in Shanghai on June 1st for a decision.

### New Trends in Contemporary Art

— Wen Zhaotong

Indeed, the realization of democracy is not only in politics, economics, education… but in all aspects. Contemporary art also necessarily has the same requirements. Because democracy is something that all of humanity unanimously yearns for, it is not just a surging tide of thought, but literally a concrete transformation of the lives of all humanity and the entire world.

The Industrial Revolution of 1764 changed the social production methods of Europe, but the tyranny of capitalism brewed the First World War from 1914 to 1918. This four-year war was seemingly over, but the so-called revival of Germany was not only the remaining poison of capitalism, but in fact further grew into the raging flames of fascism. Looking at China, after the opening of the door in 1842, China was no longer a complete country, at least it was covered in wounds. First it suffered the intrusion of capitalism, then it was strongly dissected by imperialists, and in recent decades, the repeatedly aggressive Japanese fascism has been emphatically displayed. However, the righteous banner of anti-aggression was first raised on the banks of the Lugou Bridge (蘆溝橋) in China. Under this righteous call, the Chinese masses naturally awakened from their dreams, and under the united and heroic resistance of the whole country, people of conscience all over the world also stood up one after another to attack the aggressors and dictators. The so-called Allied countries first suffered defeat and destruction in Europe, and the stubborn Japanese fascists in the East quickly followed suit and collapsed.

The collapse of fascism is the rise of democracy, which is undeniable. However, in the historical facts of art, although it cannot be said that there was a fascist phantom, European art still retained somewhat the shadow of individualistic development that reflected capitalism. We in China are still trapped in feudal shackles, let's take a look at those facts.

What was European art like after the Industrial Revolution? I. Matsa (馬察) explained it very clearly. He first clarified that the demise of the academic school was precisely the classical art that was promoted on the eve of the French Revolution, which degenerated into mediocre academicism with the defeat of Napoleon. However, it could not withstand the impact of capitalist art, and in the early 19th century, it also faded away like feudal politics. The second was the straight-line development of bourgeois art, which is the art that reflects early capitalist society, from Romanticism, Naturalism, Realism, Idealism, Impressionism to Neo-Impressionism. Here we should especially note that Impressionism represents the art of mature capitalism. In other words, the maturity of capitalism is the high development of science, which affects the social production economy of Europe, and it is the rise of financial capital. The third art development line is Post-Impressionism up to many emerging art schools before the Second World War. Finally, he also pointed out the so-called socialist art after the success of the Russian Revolution. ("History of Western Art" 西方藝術史) These four forms of development, interactively and intricately, express the prosperity of European art after the Industrial Revolution, and can also be used as correct historical evidence.

The art of feudal Chinese society, after the Opium War, it can be clearly distinguished that the inherent traditional spirit gradually disappeared. Although there are still a few writers who shout to preserve national essence, they could not withstand the invasion of foreign capitalism, and around the May Fourth Movement (五四), a large number of styles introduced from the West became Western-style art produced domestically. There are also some mediocre writers who also reconcile it in the way of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning as the application" (中學爲體，西學爲用). This indecisive phenomenon reflects one side of the panic and contradictory phenomenon of Chinese society.

Here, what we have to pay attention to is that in these more than one hundred years, apart from the emerging Soviet art, whether it is European art or Chinese art, the object of creation is always a small number of people in society. It is an art of individualism, and it is divorced from reality. Originally, capitalist society is to exploit the masses, and feudal society is to rule the masses, so how can we talk about the art enjoyment of the masses?

At least it should be admitted that this phenomenon could not be avoided in Chinese art before 1937 and European art before 1939. The National War of Resistance and the anti-aggression war can only be said to have gradually reduced some shadows in the development of art. The new establishment of art in China after the victory and in the post-war world still needs the efforts of the future.

The theme of contemporary art is democracy. An art creator should collect materials from guerrillas, soldiers, and the masses of workers and peasants. This kind of material should not only promote the heroic tradition, oppose feudalism, and oppose aggression, but also clearly express the barbarism and blood feud of fascism over the past few years, as well as the facts that split human unity. More importantly, it should promote human self-esteem, self-awareness, and sublime spirit from this theme, and call on the masses to move forward to creation, so as to start the cause of peaceful construction.

In terms of form, what we require is new realism. Originally, new realism was developed in the socialist Soviet Union. The entire atmosphere of their art is in a realistic mood. They oppose idealism and express the perfect reality with realistic techniques. They oppose being alienated from the masses and use realistic techniques to convey the reality that the masses are familiar with to the masses. Now the ideals and actions of mankind against feudalism, anti-aggression, and demand for democracy are consistent all over the world. Then the new realistic techniques in Soviet art should indeed be imitated.

What exactly is the technique of new realism? To put it plainly: it is "raising the sails" (揚葉) of the old realistic techniques. It is an expression of objectivity through subjectivity, deleting the cumbersome, delicate, and exquisite to become a bright, powerful, and simple form. In the field of Chinese national art, techniques such as bone method, brush power, and brush spirit… should also be incorporated. The Song Dynasty landscape painter Han Chuo (韓抽) said: "The brush establishes its shape and quality, and the ink distinguishes its yin and yang." ("Collection of Pure Orders for Landscape Painting" 山水純令集) It not only advocates realism, but simply further advocates new realism, and we should understand this.

The establishment of Chinese democratic new realistic art, in order to adapt to the enjoyment ability of the masses, should not be ignored "the use of old forms." Therefore, many forms familiar to the masses, such as symmetry, primitiveness, and line drawing… need to be included. At the same time, use the materials of European art to enrich the expression.

Describing the masses, approaching the masses, and instructing the masses, in order to obtain human freedom, equality, and fraternity, this great task of the present is required for the establishment of democratic new realistic art. Here, we may as well quote V. M. Friche's definition of the social function of art to end this article: "Plastic art - like all art - fulfills a certain social function. Acting on emotions and imagination through iconic media, and through this further acting on each person's thoughts, plastic art is supposed to be in line with the interests of a social group or a part of it, that is - if society is divided into classes - organize, unify, and give direction to these emotions, imaginations, and thoughts according to the interests of this class." ("Sociology of Art" 藝術社會學)

### Tomorrow

— Sudan

Tomorrow, how familiar and yet how strange. How many magnificent hopes, how many dreamy reveries, it seems like a colorful peacock dazzling with rich colors; however, after the dark night passes, tomorrow will quietly and plainly pass like today.

Every time the vast night comes again, I regret that tomorrow has become today and is lost. Regretting the passing years, silently, with a slight touch of sadness, I begin to yearn for another future tomorrow, like a very sensible child.

Who can not be like this?

But those endless tomorrows all turn into ordinary todays and disappear one by one. The glorious years of yesterday only exchanged for some accumulated memories (memory is really a heavy burden). Although today is so ordinary and so dim, it is for the hope placed in tomorrow. In order to have the hope of tomorrow to support oneself, one can wipe one's nose and no longer hate anyone. Even if one is tormented in a difficult life, one can endure some teasing and pain.

Tomorrow, full of hope, is such a soft comfort…

Really, will tomorrow get some laughter, will tomorrow get some warmth? Who can say for sure what tomorrow will be like? Who can say for sure, you clever ones, you should think carefully. What will happen if the hope of tomorrow is shattered like a drop of water? What will happen if life falls like a meteor?

Don't fantasize about the eternity of time. Although the years are endlessly long, life is only a brief moment. Ask yourself: how many tomorrows can there be in a lifetime? Don't wait for tomorrow, don't wait for tomorrow to be lost with the passing years, before you realize the preciousness of today, and sigh quietly.

When the last tomorrow of your life comes, you will feel that it is too late, too late. I tell you, in order to pursue the laughter and warmth of tomorrow, the hope and reverie of tomorrow, you must cherish today. The achievements of tomorrow all start from today.

Remember; tomorrow is an alluring witch, she will keep tricking you until death.

### Fate

— Zhongyuan

A young air force officer, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, participated in countless thrilling battles. At the critical moment, he always supported himself with a parachute and jumped down, safe and sound. When the War of Resistance was won, he was overjoyed. On a certain day in the Chinese New Year this year, he flew back to Chongqing from Calcutta, India, ready to reunite with his family. Unexpectedly, soon after flying out, he and his plane were burned to ashes in a village not far from Calcutta!

"He survived a hundred battles unscathed, but died at the time of peaceful reunification with his family after the war. It is really fate!" Hearing this news, almost everyone sighed like this.

Indeed, there are many encounters in the world that are so bizarre that they are unbelievable, inexplicable, unpredictable, and undefendable. So everyone had to believe that in the midst of it, there was another great force that was dominating the life, death, blessings, and misfortunes of mankind. This force is called "fate."

"Fate dominates everything about me!" We can often hear many people shouting like this, but is everything about mankind really dominated by fate?

I'm afraid not. For example, the above-mentioned air force officer, if he could still be as careful as when he went to war when he happily took the plane home, and carry a parachute with him, then even if the plane had an accident midway, he might still be able to save his life.

A hair's breadth of difference can turn heaven into hell! What manipulates that "hair's breadth" is not "fate," but ourselves!

"Fate" may exist, but don't push all the responsibility to "fate."

### Extravagant Words on Wang Shizi's Painting Exhibition

— Shi Chongpeng

Mr. Wang Shizi of Jurong is a renowned contemporary master of sketching from life, enjoying a high reputation both at home and abroad for nearly twenty years. After this victory, yielding to the requests of friends, he is holding a painting exhibition from May 2nd to 6th at the China Art Garden on Chengdu Road. The variety is dazzling and the beauty is overwhelming, leaving nothing for me to add! However, I cannot help but express my thoughts. I recall that twenty years ago, the Shanghai art scene was dominated by the so-called Shanghai School, characterized by careless brushstrokes and garish colors. Unaware scholars eagerly imitated it, leading to the propagation of errors and rendering it unacceptable. At that time, renowned artists from various regions came to Shanghai, and most of them echoed this trend, prioritizing convenience and profit. The only ones who stood firm, resolutely correcting these contemporary shortcomings and sweeping away the bad habit of shoddy workmanship, were the late Mr. Ma Mengrong of Jiaxing, and Mr. Wang Shizi. Mr. Wang draws inspiration from the Xu and Huang schools, incorporating the brushwork of seal script, clerical script, regular script, and cursive script. His works are realistic without being rigid, and transformative without pursuing novelty. As a result, they are meticulous yet lively, natural yet elegant, evoking moving beauty and capturing divine charm. Beyond flowers and birds, his insects and fish are particularly outstanding, encompassing the grandeur of Fuchutang, Baiyang, Nantian, and Xinluo. This is not my personal bias, but rather a shared appreciation among connoisseurs. His calligraphy is also graceful and penetrating, further confirming that Mr. Wang's artistic sources are profound and well-established. After admiring his work, I venture to add these few words for the informed.

### Flying Together (34)

— Zhao Qingge

Mrs. Mo's determination was not shaken in the slightest by Bao Ling's resistance; on the contrary, a sense of discouragement reinforced her will to destroy the tomb! Her character did not allow her to submit to anyone, especially since the one resisting her today was none other than her own son! She could not be a hero her entire life, only to now be subjected to her son's control! She clenched her fist, bit her lip, wiped away the tears of sentimentality, and calmly and resolutely began preparing her luggage, hurrying to conclude matters.

A few days later, Mrs. Mo decisively sold off the fields that she herself had purchased in Fuchu. She estimated that this sum would be sufficient for her two years of expenses in Beijing. She did not sell the house, due to her strong personality, she was unwilling to explain the reason. But in her heart, it was still for Bao Ling; she feared that Bao Ling would be left without support in Jingzhou, so she specially arranged this reliance for Bao Ling. At the same time, perhaps she was preparing a fallback for herself, worrying that one day she would return to Jingzhou. Therefore, she instructed Mo Sheng to look after the house, renting out a portion and using the income to support Bao Ling and Mo Sheng.

With everything properly arranged, Mrs. Mo decided on the date of departure. On the day of departure, Sai Ling still came back. Since running away after arguing with Mrs. Mo, he had never returned. Hearing Mo Sheng say that Mrs. Mo was about to go to Beijing, he had no choice but to come back and see her. With a heavy heart, he bid farewell to his mother and sister. For the second time, he felt the same grief that overwhelmed him when Mr. Mo passed away! Although he still believed that Mrs. Mo's trip was a mistake and that she should stay in Jingzhou peacefully, after several sleepless nights of reflection, he forgave Mrs. Mo's inability to bear the loneliness. He knew that Mrs. Mo had spent her entire life in loneliness! In the past, even though Mrs. Mo hated Mr. Mo, Mr. Mo's existence supported Mrs. Mo's spirit. Now that Mr. Mo was gone, Mrs. Mo's spirit had fallen empty!

Having forgiven Mrs. Mo, Bao Ling no longer said a word of opposition to Mrs. Mo's plans. However, the mother and son met in silence! They both felt the pain of attachment!

Li Hua's narrow-mindedness was clouded as if shrouded in a fog. She did not understand why Bao Ling was unwilling to go to Beijing with Mrs. Mo. She wanted to persuade Bao Ling, but could not find a reason to do so. She also wanted to stay with Bao Ling, but she dared not disobey Mrs. Mo. She originally did not think that this departure was so serious, so she felt very strange about Bao Ling and Mrs. Mo arguing about the "departure." Her mood had not been stirred up until now, when she was about to leave Shu Ling, leave the house where she had lived for eight years, and especially leave the study with Mr. Mo's footprints; she began to feel distressed! She liked all of this, and was reluctant to part with all of this; she wondered why Mrs. Mo wanted to abandon all of this; she was worried whether she could ever get all of this back?

### Inscription on Xi Zhuxiang's Landscape Painting

— Chen Zhongtao

Suddenly I feel as if I am in a secluded place. It's like listening to sparse bells coming from the emerald fir trees. Leaning alone on a dangerous pavilion to watch the flying waterfall. The misty plum rain covers the spring shirt.

A thatched hut, surrounded by slender bamboo and water. The spring peaks seem to have been just combed. It would be good to learn Yi'an's fondness for bronze and stone inscriptions. In a sunny window, happily paint the rivers and mountains.

### Answering Readers' Legal Queries

Wang Longyu asks: My second wife is unchaste and has been having an affair for many years. I have repeatedly advised her to no avail, and she even denies it cunningly. I am determined to end our marriage, but it is difficult to obtain solid evidence. Although some are willing to testify for me if I sue in court, the woman will surely demand living expenses if we discuss divorce, but I am poor and cannot afford such a huge sum. Please advise on a good method. If I can get divorced, it will not only be without fault but also meritorious.

[Answer from Doctor of Law, Duanmu Kai] If a wife commits adultery, it is indeed grounds for divorce, but there must be evidence of the adultery to seek a judgment from the court.

Qian Ruobing asks: I was betrothed to a woman I had never met by my parents in my youth, and we held the wedding ceremony in the spring of the thirty-third year. Unexpectedly, within a few days of the marriage, the feelings between husband and wife had already broken down. In January of the thirty-fourth year, I returned to Ning for some reason, and there has been no news for more than a year. I inquired about her address, but she had already moved. I believe that we cannot grow old together. I want to go through the divorce procedures to relieve the pain of both parties, but the other party's whereabouts are unknown, and I don't know how to start. I sincerely ask the legal experts of your column to indicate the way.

[Answer from Doctor of Law, Duanmu Kai] If it conforms to Article 1052, Section 5 of the Civil Code, where one spouse intentionally abandons the other in a continuous state, one may seek a judgment for divorce. If the other party's whereabouts are unknown, summons and other documents can be requested from the court for public service.

Yu Chengge asks: My relative lives in the countryside of Zhenhai, Zhejiang. Their ancestors left them a little over six acres of thin fields, which were rented to tenants before the war. Now the tenant has passed away and has no children. My relative intends to take back the fields and cultivate them themselves, but the tenant has a concubine's son (not born to the deceased tenant) who is forcibly continuing the lease. Now the local farmers' association is mediating, saying that the concubine's son has the right to perpetual lease. I wonder if this mediation is legal? Does the concubine's son have the right to lease in law? Please explain in detail.

[Answer from Doctor of Law, Duanmu Kai] A concubine's son has no right to inherit any rights of the concubine's husband during his lifetime.
