### Confusing Soviet Troop Movements: Shenyang in Chaos, Communist Troops Active, Dongdaying and Beiling Both Occupied

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] Amidst worsening news from the Northeast, many Central Committee members within the military hold differing opinions regarding military arrangements in the Northeast, generally advocating for strengthened military personnel. It is said that during the Second Plenary Session, a proposal was made to reassign Chen Cheng to the Northeast. It is reported that Chen himself has no objections to this, and the highest authorities may consider this suggestion.

[Our Dispatch] London, 10th (broadcast): After the Soviet withdrawal from Shenyang, Central Government troops have clashed with Communist troops.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 9th] From yesterday afternoon to the present, many Soviet military vehicles have traveled from north of Shenyang. The train station has reopened, and passenger trains have resumed service. Communist troops are very active in the northeast and south of the city, attempting to take advantage of the situation. Communist troops from Tieling, Tongyuan, and other places have been marching south at an accelerated pace in recent days, with most having reached the Ertaizi area north of Shenyang. However, our troops are very confident and determined not to easily abandon their defenses. In the past three days, many buildings in the urban area have been vacated, and the municipal government has dispatched police to guard them at all times. The Miaotuo Railway Bridge south of the city was taken over by our troops yesterday. This is our military's only takeover activity since the Soviet troops began their withdrawal. The Beiling Police Station was attacked by bandits last night and was eventually driven out. Although there is a general sense of confusion regarding the actions of the Soviet troops, there is no doubt that they have begun to leave this area.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 9th] Amidst reports of Soviet troop movements in Shenyang, many Soviet soldiers have been seen continuously on the streets here from 9:00 AM this morning until evening, seemingly new arrivals from elsewhere. Among them are occasional artillery vehicles and tanks. However, it is currently impossible to confirm whether these Soviet troops are from Shenyang. According to reports, only the northern part of Shenyang still has Soviet troops.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] From 1:00 PM on the 9th to 9:00 AM on the 10th, a total of six military trains fully loaded with Soviet soldiers and military supplies arrived in Changchun from Shenyang, disembarking approximately 500-600 soldiers, 20 artillery pieces, 40 automobiles, and 20 tanks. Furthermore, at 12:00 PM on the 9th, a train of heavy oil cars arrived from Kuanchengzi, carrying over 220 soldiers and 23 military officers who were to attend a military conference in Changchun.

[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] Chinese military intelligence reports that there are 70,000 Communist troops east of Shenyang and 100,000 south of Shenyang, while the National Army in the Shenyang area consists only of the 25th Division and the 52nd Army. However, the Communist Party insists that the Communist forces do not plan to launch an offensive in the Shenyang area.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] According to an authoritative source who spoke to reporters, in recent days, Soviet troops in Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun have been frequently mobilized. As of now, no notification has been received from the Soviet side regarding this matter. The military authorities in Shenyang have also not received formal notification from the Soviet side regarding the redeployment of Soviet troops there. The true meaning of the Soviet troop movements remains unclear to everyone. It is reported that the Shanzuizi Power Plant in Dongdaying, Shenyang, and Beiling north of the city have been occupied by Communist troops. Aside from that, Shenyang is generally calm. The number of Soviet troops arriving in Changchun yesterday is unknown, but they are located at the former site of the puppet military officer school in the southern suburbs. The Soviet troops, co-located with a regiment of our security forces, include 23 tanks, 11 trucks, and over 100 officers and soldiers. One of them, speaking in Japanese, told our soldiers that they had come from Shenyang. The authoritative source also said that there are rumors of Soviet troop movements in Changchun as well. However, according to what reporters have seen, there are no obvious signs of this at present. In recent days, the Soviet liaison officers stationed at our various agencies have claimed to be ill and have not been working, which seems to be a reduction in contact. The failure of communication between the Chinese and Soviet sides is similar to the unsuccessful meetings between Dong Yanping and key Soviet figures. Marshal Malinovsky has refused to meet guests on both the 10th and 11th.

[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] The sudden withdrawal of Soviet troops from Shenyang has drawn intense attention from people both within and outside the United Nations, who are speculating about the purpose of this move by the Soviet side. Optimists believe that the Soviet abandonment of Shenyang is the beginning of a complete withdrawal from the Northeast. Pessimists say that the sudden withdrawal of Soviet troops from Shenyang is deliberately mischievous, and the central government may not be able to send a large army in time to defend against the Communist troops in the suburbs. Furthermore, the Soviet troops could still use the pretext of ensuring transportation to Lushun and return to Shenyang at any time. According to another group of people, the public condemnation by the United States and Britain of Soviet actions in the Northeast may be the main reason for the Soviet authorities' decision to withdraw troops from Shenyang and Changchun.

### Dong Yanping's Flight to Jinzhou Fails Due to Aircraft Damage

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th, 9:00 AM Urgent] Military Delegation Head Dong Yanping was to fly to Jinzhou by special plane this afternoon to report important matters to Xiong Shihui. According to reporters, he will return to Changchun in a day or two. The plane Dong was to take was a special plane sent from Jinzhou.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th, 8:00 PM Urgent] Dong Yanping did not make the trip again today. The special plane he was riding in developed a fuel leak shortly after takeoff and flew back.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th, Urgent] Lieutenant General Dong Yanping, head of the military delegation, held his 13th meeting with Soviet Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Trotsenko on the afternoon of the 7th, lasting three hours. Yesterday, in addition to formally negotiating the Zhang Xinfu case and the Dalian port issue, Dong also raised the issue of taking over the administration of the provinces of Hujiang and Heilongjiang. Dong did so because he read the newly re-published Changchun Xinbao (Changchun New Report) newspaper, which reported that Heilongjiang had a so-called "democratically elected government" and published the names of the provincial chairman and county magistrates. At the same time, it also published information on the strength and weaponry of the province's so-called "People's Self-Defense Army." Dong specifically inquired about this with Special Envoy Trotsenko, saying that an agreement had been reached with the Soviet side to send personnel to take over Hujiang and Heilongjiang provinces months ago. At that time, the Soviet side stated that the provinces were not secure, but that order could be restored within ten days. Now, the chairmen of the two provinces have been stranded in Harbin for over a month and are still unable to proceed with the takeover. During this period, a so-called "democratically elected government" has emerged in Heilongjiang province, which is contrary to the original intention of the Soviet side to assist us in the takeover. Dong asked Trotsenko to explain. Trotsenko did not give a frank reply at the time, saying that the two provinces were still not secure. Dong asked if it was possible for us to take over, and Trotsenko said: The Soviet side currently has no troops to spare, please send Chinese troops there yourself. Dong said: How can these troops get there? Trotsenko replied: They can be transported by rail. Dong simply laughed it off.

### Sichuan Divided into Three Provinces: Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Southern Sichuan

Submitted to Chairman Chiang for Approval

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] Huang Guozhang of the Regional Division of the Central Planning Bureau recently received orders to draft a plan to divide Sichuan Province into three provinces: Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Southern Sichuan. The capitals of the three provinces would be Nanchong for Eastern Sichuan, Chengdu for Western Sichuan, and Luzhou County for Southern Sichuan. This plan has been submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval.

### Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall Complete Inspection: Military Mediation Department Issues Report on Progress

[U.S. Information Service, Beiping, 18th] The Mediation Executive Headquarters recently issued Public Notice No. 18, detailing the completed inspection of North and Central China by Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall, stating that this type of inspection will greatly increase the speed of the department's work and urging both sides' generals to set aside personal opinions and prioritize national affairs. The main section of the public notice is as follows:

There are currently no major problems in Zhangjiakou. In Jining, the main difficulty is initiating the restoration of transportation, but after this inspection, the Mediation Executive Headquarters has begun to take appropriate action.

Jinan is the main base of the Shandong Provincial Executive Group, which manages five other executive and railway groups. The situation in this province is the most serious in the entire ceasefire area. Some local problems have now been resolved, but in general, the area remains extremely sensitive.

In this regard, there are three main problems: (1) further implementation and interpretation of the ceasefire order; (2) the status of besieged troops related to the first item, i.e., whether they should be regarded as puppet troops, in addition to the lifting of the siege of important cities and the import of food; (3) immediate restoration of all interrupted transportation.

Regarding troop demobilization and reorganization, new instructions are being issued and are expected to resolve the first problem. At the same time, the committee has ordered the lifting of the siege of all besieged towns and cities nationwide and has allowed the free import of food into each city and town. The local executive group is very optimistic about solving the transportation problem.

In the Xuzhou area, both sides have heavy troops. The main problems in this area include: (a) restoring transportation and removing transportation obstacles, (b) lifting the siege of each town and city, (c) the situation at the Zaozhuang Coal Mine, (d) separating the troops. Instructions regarding the resumption of work at the coal mine will be announced today by the Mediation Executive Headquarters. At the same time, each committee member will issue orders to his subordinates, which will allow for rapid action to address the other aforementioned problems. The transportation and city de-encirclement issues are also of concern to the Xinxiang Executive Group. Another problem in this area is the separation of troops, especially the troops on the Meng County section of the Yellow River.

Zhang and Zhou solemnly declared in Xinxiang that work on transportation must be carried out immediately, and that other issues are not related and should not be involved. General Marshall fully agreed with this view.

In Taiyuan, Chairman Yan Xishan believes that there are only two problems: (1) improving communication between opposing troops, and (2) implementing the instructions of the Mediation Executive Headquarters.

Regarding the above two problems, each unit has held consultations with its subordinates separately, and significant progress has been made in resolving these difficulties.

The three committee members went to Guihua to hold talks with Sui Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth War Zone Fu Zuoyi.

As a result of their stay in Yan'an, the three committee members had the opportunity to meet with Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders. The leaders' guarantees of cooperation were extremely sincere and straightforward.

When passing through Wuhan, action was taken regarding military transportation and food shortages in conjunction with the local officials.

### Judiciary Personnel in Wuhan Appeal for Higher Pay

Salary Increase Strikes Rise and Fall

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] Due to the salary increase movement, the wave of strikes has recently risen and fallen repeatedly. Although the employees of China Aviation and Telecommunications in Wuhan have gradually resumed work, judicial and some administrative personnel yesterday telegraphed to higher authorities, appealing for higher pay and threatening to resign en masse.

### Britain Protests Soviet Removal of Resources from the Northeast with a Note

[Our Dispatch] London, 10th (broadcast): The British government has formally sent a note via Robert Chi, counselor of the British Embassy in the Soviet Union, to the Soviet government, expressing its opposition to the Soviet side's removal of resources from Japanese factories in the Northeast. It is claimed that the machinery in Manchuria belonging to the Japanese must be regarded as part of the reparations, and the distribution of the reparations should be jointly decided by the Allied countries. The British note differs from the American one in that the British note does not mention the fact that Soviet troops are stationed in the Northeast.

[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] General Marshall is currently preparing for a trip back to the United States and stayed overnight at Chairman Chiang's summer villa last night. Today, General Wedemeyer visited and held a meeting. Marshall is scheduled to meet with Zhou Enlai today.

### The Second Plenary Session's Thirteenth General Meeting Continues to Review Local Administration; Commander-in-Chief He Reports on the Surrender Process

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] The Second Plenary Session held its thirteenth general meeting at 3:00 PM on the 10th, with 218 committee members in attendance. Committee Member Chen Guofu presided. Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin gave a surrender report, which lasted an hour. Committee Member Hu Shuhua then made a temporary motion in the name of the entire meeting to pay tribute to Supreme Commander Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and all national soldiers. All the committee members in attendance unanimously stood up and passed the motion. After a ten-minute recess was announced, the review of the local administration report began. Many committee members focused their remarks on the low efficiency of local administration, the prevalence of nepotism, rampant corruption, financial difficulties, and the meager salaries of staff. The committee members who spoke included Luo Gonghua, Fang Qingru, Li Peiji, Wang Xingzhou, Peng Zhaoxian, Li Wenzhai, Hu Qiuyuan, Cheng Zhonghang, Wen Yiyou, and Deng Feihuang. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The memorial service to Dr. Sun Yat-sen will be held at 9:00 AM tomorrow, followed by the fourteenth general meeting. The review meeting will be held in the afternoon. Chiang Kai-shek hosted a dinner banquet for the plenary committee members at 7:00 PM in the auditorium of the Military Council.

[United Press, Chongqing, 9th] The Second Plenary Session continued to meet today. Food Minister Xu Kan reported that the supplies shipped to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have not reached the projected amount, and the domestic food problem is very serious. U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall will discuss the issue of providing food to China with UNRRA officials when he returns to Washington. China is seeking UNRRA's permission to purchase rice from Vietnam, Burma, and Siam. UNRRA Director General Lehman recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Food, urging the Chinese people to reduce their food consumption to the lowest possible level to await the autumn harvest. The most worrisome issue is military rice, because the purchase price of military rice is two or three times lower than the market price. He will report on the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly in the coming days.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] A public memorial service for the late Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Ye Chucang, the late General Advisor of the Military Council Li Liejun, and the late Supervisory Committee Member Li Menggeng was held at the Youth Hall in the capital on the 10th. All members of the Central Committee and the heads of various ministries and commissions of the National Government attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony, and after leading the attendees in paying their respects, everyone observed a moment of silence. The ceremony concluded at around 10:00 AM, lasting approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. Over a thousand people continued to pay their respects throughout the day.

### Troops Massed at Huanggu Village

— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao from Goubangzi

At a time when the eyes of the whole world are focused on the Northeast, which is the lifeline of our country, the Northeast itself already has a hint of spring. The sun shines on the earth, warm and pleasant.

But when the sky changes its face, the gloomy low pressure and the struggling little northerly wind slap you in the face, which is quite embarrassing.

Big Noses and Little Noses

The people of the Northeast are also in a fluctuating mood, observing the weather with a mixture of joy and sorrow. The trauma must not be torn open again!

In the past, the people of the Northeast gave nicknames to both the Japanese and the Russians, because they are our close and intimate neighbors. So, we looked for a special feature on them, and the nose was the most noticeable. The fate of the two nicknames "Little Nose" and "Big Nose" was thus decided, probably during the Russo-Japanese War in our territory of the Northeast.

As you step into the gate of the Northeast, you can hear everyone talking about the stories of "Big Nose" long and "Big Nose" short. At the same time, you can also hear people from Shenyang talking about the reality being played out by "Big Nose", in all shapes and colors, a magnificent sight.

Of course, the people of the Northeast were elated and overjoyed at the defeat of the "Little Noses." Of course, they were also sincerely grateful and gratified for the help of the "Big Noses." However, after such a long period of half a year, the reality in front of them has made everyone suspicious, wondering if there are still problems in the Northeast that has been liberated.

The Question of Soviet Troop Withdrawal

When everyone shouted and requested that our ally, the Soviet Union, withdraw its troops stationed in the Northeast, the compatriots in the Northeast felt immense excitement and comfort. Although according to the news, this request and hope is currently difficult to become a reality, everyone always feels that our allies will not let us down too much.

The Soviet Red Army has heavily armed troops stationed on the transportation lines in the Northeast. It is said that there are two armored divisions among them. The closest place to our army is Shenyang. The Red Army is in Shenyang City, and our army is in Huanggu Village, less than fifteen miles from the western suburbs of Shenyang. Occasionally, a small number of brothers from both sides meet.

It is reported that the Soviet troops in Dalian have recently increased, and restrictions on citizens entering and leaving are very strict. There are not many Soviet troops in Yingkou, about two hundred, and construction equipment is being expanded and strengthened. Because of this, some people think the situation is bad, but in fact, we still need to observe calmly and plan to enhance the friendship between the two sides. Everything still depends on human effort overcoming nature.

The Eighth Route Army

The people have a deep understanding of the advance and actions of the Eighth Route Army in the Northeast. At the same time, there are also rumors about the differences between "Real Eighth Route," "Similar Eighth Route," and "Local Eighth Route." The Eighth Route Army in the central areas of the "Southern Manchuria" line and the Beining Railway line are said to have landed in Yingkou from Longkou, Shandong, by wooden boat. The unit number is the First, Second, and Third detachments of the "Liaodong People's Self-Defense Army", each detachment having three regiments, with each regiment having more than one thousand five hundred people.

According to investigations, there are currently 10,000 Communist troops along the Liao River, 20,000 Communist troops near Liaoning, and approximately 50,000 to 60,000 Communist troops on the outskirts of Shenyang. Other areas are unknown. It is also reported that He Long arrived in Haicheng on the 27th to command. Communist troops in Yingkou recently used the opportunity to check electricity meters to check household registrations. There seems to be a concentration of Communist troops in Haicheng, and Lin Biao is in the Faku and Zhangwu areas.

It is also reported that there are a large number of Eighth Route Army troops in the area east of the Changchun Railway line and near Kaiyuan, Tieling, Fushun, Benxi, and other places, seemingly controlling the mining areas. Northwest of Shenyang, north of Zhangwu, there are other puppet Mongolian troops active, harassing the area.

Political Situation on the Beining Railway Line

The terrain of Liaoning Province looks like two legs stretching into the Bohai Sea at the southern end. The areas where the National Army is stationed are only one leg on the right. This leg is the dozen or so counties that the Liaoning Provincial Government can currently control, from Suizhong in the south to Xinmin in the north, including Xingcheng, Jin County, Jinxi, Yi County, Beizhen, Heishan, Liaozhong, He'an, Panjin, and other counties. There are also two or three incomplete counties.

The National Army currently controls the entire Beining Railway line and one or two incomplete branch lines of the Beining Railway. Trains are crowded, mostly with small traders, because there is a shortage of goods, so it is very difficult. Some people travel back and forth between Yingkou and Goubangzi, transporting Yingkou cigarettes to various places on the Beining line for sale.

In these recovered counties, administrative construction requires a lot of effort. Financial difficulties are a major cause. At the same time, there are many inconveniences in the legal system and regulations. A county government official told reporters: "Many of the puppet Manchu county government staff who stayed behind find the current complex procedures for official documents and handling affairs very inconvenient, and even find it difficult to write official documents with a brush. The general public also has many inconveniences." This requires finding ways to simplify all administrative procedures, and also requires many measures to adapt to the environment. In addition, lower-level administrative cadres of the puppet Manchu regime should be used well, as they will be of great help in bridging the general gap.

Unbearable Bloodshed

Amidst the sincere calls from compatriots across the country not to kill each other and destroy construction, there have recently been sporadic and unfortunate incidents between the National and Communist armies in the Northeast. For example, on the night of February 27, the Lijiaqiao Bridge on the Beining Railway line was destroyed, and one or two small stations were attacked. Fortunately, the damage was not significant, and it was repaired and quieted on the same day.

In the early and middle parts of February, there were several major bloodshed incidents, and both the National and Communist sides suffered heavy casualties. It is said that in the initial battle of Yingkou, one battalion and two companies of a certain army of the National Army, except for a few who were captured, mostly suffered the tragic fate of being sacrificed. The Communist troops also suffered heavy casualties.

From February 16 to 20, there was another conflict between the National and Communist armies in the Shaling area northeast of Panjin. The Communist troops began attacking Shaling on the night of the 16th, and the battle was fierce for a total of four days and five nights. During the day, both sides used artillery shelling, and at night they launched assault attacks. The conflict later stopped. The National Army suffered considerable casualties, and the Communist troops suffered even heavier casualties. It is said that civilians were also involved. There were large numbers of wounded soldiers in Yingkou and Haicheng, and there were other rumors, which I really cannot bear to describe in detail! (March 2)

### 津浦隴海　修理受阻

The repairs on the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Longhai railways are being obstructed.

膠濟下月可全線通車

The Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan) Railway is expected to be fully operational next month.

〔本報徐州十日電〕

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th Dispatch]

津浦北段自利國驊至　州之修復工程，昨晨開工數小時後，因共軍阻止，復吿停頓。聞共軍又提出幾個新要求：（一）路局須派負責人，與共軍商洽人事問題。（二）修路工人，經過河橋時，須經由共軍檢查。（三）收回民間鐵路器材，按共軍定價付款。交通小組刻又電呈北平調處執行部，請示解決辦法。

The restoration project of the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, from Liguo Hua to 　Zhou, was halted again yesterday morning after only a few hours of work due to obstruction by the Communist army. It is reported that the Communist army has put forward several new demands: (1) The Railway Bureau must send a responsible person to discuss personnel issues with the Communist army. (2) Repair workers must be inspected by the Communist army when passing river bridges. (3) Railway materials recovered from civilians must be paid for at prices set by the Communist army. The transportation team has now telegraphed the Beiping Mediation Executive Headquarters for instructions on how to resolve the situation.

〔本報徐州十日電〕

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th Dispatch]

隴海東段修復工作，照交通小組規定，原擬昨（九）日開始，由於該地區共軍之拒絕，已成泡影。

The restoration work on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, which was originally scheduled to start yesterday (the 9th) according to the regulations of the transportation team, has failed due to the refusal of the Communist army in that area.

〔中央社濟南九日電〕

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 9th Dispatch]

膠洲鐵路被破壞之二段地區，預計一個月左右，可恢復全綫通車，此爲濟南執行小組一行，赴張店交涉之重大收獲。津浦區鐵路局八日晨由濟開去之工程車一列，直駛張店，開始動工，材料方面，似無大困難，中共方面已允將藏於民間之鐵軌等物交出，中共控制下之各站，仍須由共方管理。又關於津浦路濟南以南被破壞之鐵路修復問題，泰安執行小組八日晨來濟，將與由平來此之鐵道小組會商後返泰。

It is estimated that the two sections of the Jiaozhou Railway that were damaged can be restored to full operation in about a month. This is a major achievement of the Jinan Executive Team's trip to Zhangdian for negotiations. A train of engineering vehicles dispatched by the Jinpu Railway Bureau from Ji'nan on the morning of the 8th drove directly to Zhangdian and began work. There seems to be no major difficulty in terms of materials. The Chinese Communist side has agreed to hand over the rails and other materials hidden among the people. The stations under the control of the Chinese Communist Party will still be managed by the Communist side. Regarding the restoration of the damaged railway south of Jinan on the Jinpu Railway, the Tai'an Executive Team came to Jinan on the morning of the 8th and will return to Tai'an after discussing with the Railway Team from Beiping.

### 行動復員會議

### Action Restoration Conference

全會閉幕後在渝舉行

To be Held in Chongqing After the Closing of the Plenary Session

〔本報南京十日電〕

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch]

重慶訊：勝利後首次全國行政復員會議，聞將於二中全會閉幕後，在渝舉行，由行政院長宋子文主持，因中委兼各省主席均已到渝，可能就近召集，以節省時間。此次會議如不邀各廳處長出席，將來還都後，仍須召集全國性擴大行政會議。惟此舉勢須於國民大會閉幕政府改組後實行。

Chongqing News: It is reported that the first National Administrative Restoration Conference after the victory will be held in Chongqing after the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Sixth Central Committee, presided over by Premier Song Ziwen. Because the Central Committee members who are also provincial chairmen have all arrived in Chongqing, it is possible to convene the meeting nearby to save time. If this meeting does not invite the heads of various departments and divisions to attend, it will still be necessary to convene a national expanded administrative conference after the capital is moved back. However, this move must be implemented after the closing of the National Assembly and the reorganization of the government.

### 宋院長報告（二續）

### Premier Song's Report (Continued, Part 2)

在增加收入方面，先須積極整理稅收，我們大家都明白，在一般社會上人人都希望政府於戰事終了之後，能减輕人民的負擔，但本席不能不直說經濟危機的嚴重性，不下於戰事的危機，政府爲求收支平衡，不能不求收入的增加，以期渡過當前的經濟危機，即使加重人民負擔，亦不得不忍耐一時。因爲人民的痛苦，莫甚於經濟的崩潰，政府要能使國民經濟，達到穩定，人民在過渡期內，自不能不有相當犧牲。如果政府能將經濟穩定，我們即使有點錯誤，人民可以原諒，反之，如果經濟趨於崩潰，即另有任何臨時的安慰，人民也不能滿意，現在必定要有克服當前困難的決心。

In terms of increasing revenue, we must first actively reorganize taxation. We all understand that in general society, everyone hopes that the government can reduce the burden on the people after the end of the war. However, I must frankly say that the severity of the economic crisis is no less than the crisis of war. In order to achieve a balance of payments, the government cannot but seek to increase revenue in order to overcome the current economic crisis. Even if it increases the burden on the people, it must be endured for a while. Because the suffering of the people is no greater than the collapse of the economy. If the government can stabilize the national economy, the people can forgive us even if we make some mistakes. Conversely, if the economy collapses, no temporary comfort can satisfy the people. We must now have the determination to overcome the current difficulties.

### 整頓稅收之外處理敵偽產業

### Handling Enemy and Puppet Assets in Addition to Reorganizing Taxation

在增加收入方面除了整頓稅收之外，另有一大宗臨時收入，就是敵僞產業的處理。現在社會上有許多人注意行政院處理敵僞產業的事情，並且也聽到各種的批評，我們一定都明白，敵人投降以後，政府所接收的敵僞產業，當然應該爲國家所有，這在任何國家都是一樣的，而且政府的經濟狀况，已經這樣困難，所以處理敵偽產業，也是目前最重要的工作，因爲收支平衡最重要的途徑，是縮减軍費，但在縮編期內，仍須有一個過渡抵補的辦法，這就是處理敵僞產業的收入。這種產業，雖然不能一天都變成現款，但於相當時期內，善爲處理，在彌補國庫收入，不無小補。

In addition to reorganizing taxation in terms of increasing revenue, there is another large temporary income, which is the handling of enemy and puppet assets. Many people in society are now paying attention to the Executive Yuan's handling of enemy and puppet assets, and have also heard various criticisms. We must all understand that after the enemy surrenders, the enemy and puppet assets received by the government should of course belong to the state. This is the same in any country, and the government's economic situation is already so difficult, so handling enemy and puppet assets is currently the most important task. Because the most important way to balance income and expenditure is to reduce military spending, but during the downsizing period, there must still be a transitional compensation method, which is the income from handling enemy and puppet assets. Although these assets cannot all be converted into cash in one day, properly handling them within a considerable period of time will help to make up for the treasury revenue.

### 解救收復區糧荒　將採取四項對策　糧食農林兩部將予合併

### Four Countermeasures to be Adopted to Relieve the Food Shortage in the Recovered Areas; the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Will Be Merged

〔本報南京十日電〕

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch]

重慶訊，當局於聽取來渝出席二中全會之收復區各省主席，報吿湘·鄂·粵·桂·皖·贛·江·浙各地一般糧荒情况，及各地因兵災匪禍而造成之農業衰敗嚴重危機，至表殷憂。將採取下列對策，（一）部份停止以官價收購軍糧，俟接收遣俘復員完成後，全面停止。（二）由政府採購大宗洋米，以應軍秣，兼顧民食。（三）厲行糧食增產運動，並列爲考成。（四）調整產米區與缺糧區之交通，以濟盈虛。聞糧食部與農林部將合併，同時有人主張將糧部併入財部，但爲適應當前局勢，糧部工作亦須持續至政府改組後，再予合併。

Chongqing News: The authorities, after listening to the reports from the provincial chairmen of the recovered areas who came to Chongqing to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Sixth Central Committee, on the general food shortage in Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, and the severe crisis of agricultural decline caused by war and banditry in various places, expressed deep concern. The following countermeasures will be adopted: (1) Partially stop purchasing military grain at official prices, and completely stop after the completion of reception, repatriation, and demobilization. (2) The government will purchase large quantities of foreign rice to meet military needs and take into account civilian food. (3) Vigorously promote the grain production increase campaign and list it as a performance assessment item. (4) Adjust transportation between rice-producing areas and grain-deficient areas to balance surpluses and deficits. It is reported that the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be merged. At the same time, some people advocate merging the Ministry of Food into the Ministry of Finance, but in order to adapt to the current situation, the work of the Ministry of Food must also continue until after the government is reorganized before merging again.

鎭江訊，趕修蘇北歸江壩暨以大宗農貸拯救蘇北已吿破產之農村，實不容稍緩。旅鎭蘇北人士，於讀本報時，獲悉中委薛篤弼爲呼籲速興水利，曾言及善後救濟總署，將於短期內結束，均表憂憤，已紛函毛澤東，速令蘇北共軍，勿妨害蘇北水利工程之進行，如不能利用善救總署之物資，以救蘇北垂危之農村，一日蘇北變成澤國，不僅禍及江南，即蘇魯邊區共軍，認爲豐美之紅色糧倉，亦將成爲泡影矣。

Zhenjiang News: Rushing to repair the Guijiang Dam in northern Jiangsu and using large agricultural loans to save the bankrupt villages in northern Jiangsu cannot be delayed. People from northern Jiangsu living in Zhenjiang learned when reading this newspaper that Central Committee member Xue Dubi, in order to appeal for the rapid development of water conservancy, mentioned that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration would end in the short term. They all expressed concern and anger, and have sent letters to Mao Zedong, urging him to order the Communist army in northern Jiangsu not to hinder the progress of water conservancy projects in northern Jiangsu. If the materials of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration cannot be used to save the endangered villages in northern Jiangsu, if northern Jiangsu becomes a swamp one day, it will not only harm Jiangnan, but also the Communist army in the border area of Jiangsu and Shandong, which regards it as a fertile red granary, will also become an illusion.

### 國際大局疑雲密佈　三強正謀總解決　三國首長大有再度會議可能　頭痛醫頭政策徒足增添紛爭

### The International Situation is Clouded with Doubt; the Three Powers are Seeking a Comprehensive Solution; The Leaders of the Three Countries are Highly Likely to Meet Again; A Policy of Treating the Head When it Hurts Only Adds to the Disputes

〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕

[United Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch]

國際大局，疑雲密佈，氣氛極爲惡劣。美，英，蘇三國首長大有再度會議可能，以圖一勞永逸，對各項問題，求取總解決。華府外交界認爲日前所取政策，不啻頭痛　頭，脚痛醫脚，從足增添紛爭。美，英，蘇再度會商，問題似在何方發動，召開會議，杜魯門總統週五曾表示三强會議，非不可能，但應在華盛頓舉行。目下已起爭執者，有義大利，伊朗，土耳其，中國之東九省，與保加利亞數地，足使三强會議，煞費討論。

The international situation is clouded with doubt, and the atmosphere is extremely bad. There is a high possibility that the leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will meet again in an attempt to solve all problems once and for all. Washington diplomatic circles believe that the policies taken recently are like treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, which only adds to the disputes. The question of where to initiate and convene the meeting for the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to consult again seems to be the issue. President Truman stated on Friday that a three-power conference is not impossible, but it should be held in Washington. Currently, the disputes that have arisen include Italy, Iran, Turkey, the nine eastern provinces of China, and several places in Bulgaria, which are enough to make the three-power conference a difficult discussion.

大批法軍今晨已在海防登陸，將佔領碼頭一帶及海防市東西兩區，中國軍隊仍駐守城區中心。

A large number of French troops landed in Haiphong this morning and will occupy the wharf area and the eastern and western districts of Haiphong City. Chinese troops are still stationed in the center of the urban area.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch]

中央社河內電訊：法軍于萬已於八日夜在海防登陸，準備自十六日起接防越南北部，惟法方尚不知接防將展期至十六日，以爲即可接收。法軍登陸前，先曾與越南當局成立預備協定，守軍乃奉命停止攻擊法艦，今越南北部情形已復平靜狀態。

Central News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: 10,000 French troops landed in Haiphong on the night of the 8th, preparing to take over the defense of northern Vietnam from the 16th. However, the French side was not aware that the handover would be extended to the 16th and thought they could take over immediately. Before the French troops landed, they had established a preliminary agreement with the Vietnamese authorities, and the defending troops were ordered to stop attacking the French warships. The situation in northern Vietnam has now returned to a calm state.

〔中央社河內十日專電〕

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th Special Dispatch]

越南政府頃頒佈命令，禁止一切集會遊行，並嚴格管制報章雜誌言論，以免破壞法越協定與中法軍隊之交防工作。登陸海防之法軍逾一萬五千人，已超過法越協定所規定之數目。河內方面留居於大兵營內之法軍五千人仍未裝配，以若干交防之小節目尚未商定，與法越停止衝突命令尚未普遍傳達，恐發生意外，但一般相信十六日交防，必可順利實行。

The Vietnamese government has recently issued an order prohibiting all gatherings and demonstrations, and strictly controlling the speech of newspapers and magazines, in order to avoid disrupting the Franco-Vietnamese agreement and the handover work of the Chinese and French troops. More than 15,000 French troops have landed in Haiphong, exceeding the number stipulated in the Franco-Vietnamese agreement. The 5,000 French troops stationed in the large barracks in Hanoi have not yet been equipped, because some small details of the handover have not yet been agreed upon, and the order to cease conflict between France and Vietnam has not been widely disseminated. There is fear of accidents, but it is generally believed that the handover on the 16th will be carried out smoothly.

World peace will face infinite difficulties due to Churchill's tense words. Churchill's purpose is only to preserve the British Empire and restore its lost glory."

美國旗上最後一顆星，係於三十四年前所加上者，今則夏威夾人民已向國會進言謂：增加第四十九顆星今其時矣。在一八九八年威夷成爲美國領土以前，最後加入聯邦之一州爲猶他州，係於一八九六年一月四日加入。小組委員會之結論，對於夏威夷之成爲一州，大體表示贊助，紙等待衆院領土委員會之報告即可決定。杜魯門總統在其當年文告中曾敦促國會「應儘速成全夏威夷人民希望，將該領土成爲一州之願望」。衆院領土代表法林頓巳提出一法案，使夏威夷人民成立憲法及州政府，以便加入美國聯邦，與其他各州立於同等地位。

The last star on the American flag was added 34 years ago. Now, the people of Hawaii have petitioned Congress, saying: It is time to add the 49th star. Before Hawaii became a U.S. territory in 1898, the last state to join the Union was Utah, which joined on January 4, 1896. The conclusion of the subcommittee generally supports Hawaii becoming a state and can be decided as soon as the report of the House Territories Committee is awaited. President Truman urged Congress in his message that year to "fulfill the wishes of the people of Hawaii as soon as possible and make the territory a state." House Territories Representative Farrington has introduced a bill to enable the people of Hawaii to establish a constitution and state government in order to join the American Federation and stand on an equal footing with other states.

### Editorial: On Rice Loan

Since the War of Resistance, many industrial and commercial enterprises have hoped to obtain large loans. Some of these loans are for proactive purposes, such as purchasing machinery or raw materials, while others are for defensive purposes, such as resolving crises or maintaining production. We often hear of certain loans amounting to billions of yuan, indicating that national banks are fulfilling their duties in this regard.

However, according to what we have heard, there are still many areas that fail to fully satisfy people's expectations. First, the procedures are too cumbersome, preventing timely action. Second, the conditions are too harsh and difficult to meet in practice. For example, the collateral requirement, such as gold bars or real estate, is unacceptable to borrowers. If they had gold bars, wouldn't they sell them themselves? If they had real estate, couldn't other banks accept it? It should be understood that they are seeking assistance from national banks precisely because they lack such collateral. It should also be understood that they are not seeking accommodation from ordinary commercial banks precisely because their situation is unique and different from ordinary capital turnover. National banks undertaking such loans should be seen as supporting production and rescuing industry and commerce, rather than simply seeking profit. Therefore, in addition to ensuring the safety of funds, they should also sympathize with the difficulties of businesses and help them find a way out. This is the proper approach.

However, there are also points of discussion on the part of the industrial and commercial sectors. After the recovery, in order to replenish supplies, the authorities promoted group purchasing and introduced them to loans. This can also be considered a way of sympathizing with the difficulties of businesses. According to what I have heard, some businesses present a general account, stating the amount of purchases, the cost, and the freight, all of which must be covered by the loan. It seems as if they have no working capital at all, which is simply unacceptable. We know that businesses vary in size and capital, and it is impossible to generalize. However, merchants always seek profit from capital, so how could they be completely empty-handed and penniless?

Yesterday, I heard about the rice loan program, which requires rice merchants to recognize half of the amount, with the national bank lending the other half. That is, if rice merchants are willing to invest 2 billion yuan, then the bank will also lend 2 billion yuan. We believe that this is the fairest and most reasonable condition, and both parties should accept it. Because if it is handled in this way, first, the bank can rest assured; second, the strength will be more substantial; and third, official-merchant cooperation can be thoroughly realized. Therefore, rice loans can be handled in this way, and tea loans, silk loans, and other loans can also be handled in this way. We believe that this is a very good example.

As for the other conditions, on the one hand, it is necessary to ensure the safety of the principal and interest, and on the other hand, it is necessary to consider the actual difficulties of the other party. Everyone should overcome the current crisis in the industry in a spirit of mutual trust and mutual understanding. As for all the procedures, especially the time factor must be considered. For example, the preparation for purchasing tea should be done quickly. If we keep consulting, discussing, delaying, and complicating things, and miss the appropriate season, then the grand goal of supporting industry and commerce and circulating funds will always feel somewhat imperfect. As mentioned above, this type of loan has a proactive nature and is different from ordinary commercial loans. We hope that industry and commerce will work hard and not have a completely dependent mentality. At the same time, we also hope that the authorities will focus on the big picture and not use business standards as the sole criterion.

### A Tragedy Amidst Labor Unrest: Two Workers Shot Dead in Front of the Zhabu Road City Guard Team Headquarters

(Our Dispatch) Recently, a wave of labor unrest has occurred among carpenters and joiners in this city due to wage issues. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, hundreds of carpenters and joiners passed by the Victory Theater on Zhabu Road, Hongkou, and went to the First Squadron of the First Battalion of the City Guard Team to demand the release of two arrested workers. A dispute arose, and the team members fired three shots to suppress the crowd, hitting two workers in the head on the spot. The bullets pierced the back of their heads, causing severe injuries, and they fell to the ground. One of them died immediately. The other injured worker was rushed to the Shanghai Sanitarium by ambulance for treatment, but he died at 9 PM last night. Afterwards, Fu Bolang, the director of the responsible police precinct, personally led Shi Junrong, the criminal investigation section chief, and Yang Tianfu, a patrol officer, to investigate. They telegraphed the General Telegraph Office and then led the garrison headquarters to instruct the precinct director to investigate the incident in detail and handle it according to law.

### Peace Road Workers Assault Officer

The officer tried to dissuade them, leading to a misunderstanding and resulting in him being assaulted. At the same time, Section Chief Liang, who was passing by, was also assaulted on the head and other parts of his body. Afterwards, Director Yao of the precinct dispatched a large number of police officers to disperse the crowd.

### Murder Case at Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road: Traveler Killed; Preemptive Strike and Standing Up for Injustice Cause Trouble; Murderer Surrenders to Police Precinct

(Our Dispatch) A soldier, wearing a grass-green uniform, checked into room 55 on the second floor of the Zhongshan Hotel at No. 480 Tianjin Road on the morning of the 6th. He registered under the name Wang Yucai. That night, he consorted with a prostitute named Chen Jinbao, 26 years old, from Yangzhou. They spent several days together, and their relationship became increasingly close. On the 7th, Wang led two soldiers to the home of Yang Liansheng, who ran an opium den business at No. 511 Ningbo Road. Under the pretext of searching for military weapons, they broke into the inner room and searched arbitrarily, but found nothing. They then saw Yang's twin sister smoking opium and, using this as an excuse, threatened her extensively and extorted 200,000 yuan, eventually settling for 45,000 yuan, which they took away.

The following evening, Cai Wenjin (a staff member at a cooperative) visited Yang at his residence for dinner. Liansheng told him the truth about what had happened. Cai believed that soldiers should not extort from the people and said that if they came again, he would find a way to arrest them. Yang was excited by this assurance, thinking he had found a protector. Around 3 PM yesterday afternoon, Wang and the other two returned to Yang's residence to extort money again but were unsuccessful and left angrily. Yang sent someone to follow them and saw them enter the Zhongshan Hotel and go upstairs. He immediately returned home and notified Wenjin by telephone. Shortly afterwards, Cai arrived, went to the front desk of the Zhongshan Hotel to inquire, but could not determine which room they were staying in. As he was walking out the door, Wang happened to return from outside. Yang identified him without error. Cai followed him into the hotel and upstairs. In the middle of the staircase, Cai stepped forward to greet him, but before he could finish speaking, Wang pretended to reach for a gun. Cai, in order to preemptively strike, immediately pulled out the pistol he had prepared and fired a shot, hitting Wang in the right waist. He fell to the ground. At this time, Cai, realizing that he had caused trouble, went to the Old City Police Precinct to surrender and reported what had happened. Jiang Shangpei, the director of the judicial section, led section members Chen Junqian and Zhang Kuidong, along with the military police patrol team, to investigate. They immediately sent the injured man to Renji Hospital, but he died shortly afterwards. A pistol with three bullets, more than 30,000 yuan in legal tender, and several small photos of women were found in the deceased's pocket. The prostitute Chen Jinshi was also brought to the precinct for questioning. After investigation, it was determined that the deceased's real name was Wang Xingcai. The suspect was later transferred to the patrol team for processing.

### Public Bidding for Police Alarm Installation

(Our Dispatch) The Municipal Police Department convened the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various sectors to establish a Police Alarm Installation Promotion Committee to carry out the installation of police alarms. It has now been decided to first install alarms in 3,000 households along the roads in Huangpu District as a trial. They are currently busy collecting fees. The original price for each alarm was set at 6,000 yuan. However, due to the recent surge in prices, the installation cost is too different from the actual amount collected, making it difficult for the police department to bear. Therefore, after repeated meetings, the Promotion Committee decided that the fees will be appropriately increased in the future so that the project can be completed as soon as possible. The contract work was originally scheduled to be undertaken by Shunhua Commercial Firm. Now, in order to be cautious, the bureau will conduct a public bidding before making a decision.

### Speculative Atmosphere Permeates the Market: A Weekly Overview; Gold Leads, Cotton Yarn Advances

Financial waves rose again last week. The "han chi" (a type of currency note) led the way, with stocks, bonds, and foreign currencies showing color. Other cotton yarn, rice, daily necessities, and other items soared in unison. The price of rice once exceeded 30,000 yuan, but returned to 29,000 yuan by the weekend, causing hardship for ordinary people. Although the Central Bank continuously allocated gold, it was like too many monks and too little gruel. Merchants continued to raise prices on pretexts, making speculative profits easily. As a result, speculative funds concentrated on attacking various commodity markets, unwilling to seek normal outlets. At the same time, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises suffered from too little working capital and were unable to operate. If this contradictory phenomenon is not resolved early, the future of industrial and commercial enterprises will be dangerous, and the national economy will become increasingly impoverished. The week's trends are briefly described below.

"Han Chi" On Monday, the foreign exchange began trading, and people were firmly bullish. Initially, it approached 1.6 million yuan from 1.58 million yuan. Eventually, the US exchange rate was quoted at 2,020 yuan, and there were sellers, so the price returned to 1.45 million yuan. A stalemate formed on Tuesday and Wednesday. Subsequently, as the term exchange rate rose, speculation was triggered. On Thursday, it jumped to 1.75 million yuan. On Friday, the Central Bank allocated 140 taels at a discounted price of 1.65 million, and the surge slowed down slightly. On Saturday, it was allocated again at a price of 1.7 million, and the market situation rose even more. The highest price was 1.78 million yuan.

Foreign Currency The US dollar initially reached 2,080 yuan, but as the foreign exchange opened at 2,020 yuan, the price returned slightly. On Thursday, due to the rise of gold, it rose from 1,990 yuan to 2,180 yuan. However, the Central Bank's exchange rate did not move, stabilizing slightly. Later, as traders absorbed cash, the market price rose higher and higher. The closing price on Saturday was 2,150. Hong Kong dollars continued to be strong this week due to the activity of speculative funds, with new currency rising and old currency stable.

Unified Bonds At the beginning of the week, they were uniformly sluggish due to tight money. On Thursday, buying from the Northern Gang saw a rebound. On Friday, the financial community absorbed more, and the price continued to rise. On Saturday, types C, D, and E rose slightly, while types A and B were flat.

Chinese Stocks At the beginning of the week, there was a lot of selling by those facing tight money. Various stocks fell, with Yong Yarn falling to 2,500 yuan and Meiya retreating within 2,000. On Wednesday, as the gold and foreign exchange market fluctuated slightly, speculative funds turned to stocks. Under the buying pressure from banks and the Northern Gang, a sudden surge occurred. Yong An Spinning Mill rose from 2,650 yuan to 3,250 yuan, Meiya from 1,800 yuan to 2,400 yuan, and Jingfu reached an unprecedented high price of 160 yuan. On Thursday, rumors spread that a temporary market would be set up, and money became looser, with buyers following one another. The yarn mill rose again to 3,450 yuan, Meiya 2,600 yuan, and Jingfu reached an unprecedented high price of 160 yuan. On Friday, it was slightly tired. On Saturday, it showed beauty again, with Yong Yarn reaching 3,700 yuan. Foreign stocks were initially sluggish due to tight money. On Wednesday, arbitrage buying started, and the price rose. It did not plateau until Friday, and on Saturday, it uniformly fell.

Spot Yarn In the past week, it was initially very mediocre. Later, due to the soaring prices of gold and stocks, and the fact that sales to customers were not bad, some yarn merchants still had thoughts of raising prices, and there were not many new sellers. There was a situation of demand exceeding supply in the market, so the situation gradually became high-flying. The highest for the whole week was 2.85 million for 60 count Sunlight on Friday, and the lowest was 500,000 for 10 count Huozhu on Monday. In terms of count, 42 count Lanhuang (Blue Phoenix) rose the most at 180,000, 20 count Te Shuangma (Special Double Horse) rose 160,000, and 16 count Guangming (Bright) rose 150,000. In addition, each yarn rose by 70,000 to 80,000.

Cloth Market Because customer sales were not smooth, the Textile Construction Company (Fangjian) sold a lot, and the number of chips was sufficient, so the rise was very slight. Peach Blossom, Lady Lin, and Ruyi bleached cloth each rose by 4,000 to 5,000, and the other brands rose by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Cotton Market Transactions were still smooth. The Textile Construction Company purchased first, followed by private spinning mills and flower merchants. The market situation was even tighter than that of yarn and cloth. According to people in the industry, the current flower price is still cheap, and the difference between the high and low yarn prices is huge. Yarn mills buy flowers and spin yarn, making huge profits, especially fine yarn. Therefore, buying is very strong. Each flower rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan compared to last Saturday.

Other As for other things, there were more rises than falls. After the food boom rose sharply on Friday, all goods were affected. Among daily necessities, matches were the most affected. The black market for fuel was rampant, and the market price was relatively high. White coal blocks have risen to 660,000 yuan per ton.

### Singapore Restricts Overseas Remittances; Overseas Chinese Eagerly Await Revision

(Central News Agency Singapore 9th dispatch) Overseas Chinese here are deeply disappointed with the new overseas remittance regulations stipulated by the British authorities, which will take effect from March 18. It is generally believed that the monthly limit of 45 yuan for remittances is too low. The stipulation that no more than one remitter per family makes it even more difficult for overseas Chinese, because the family members themselves also have families in China, and these families in China still need to obtain financial assistance from them when the new remittance regulations are implemented. Overseas Chinese from all walks of life are considering the request of our Consul General in Singapore to the authorities to revise the new regulations.

### Customs Visa Office Begins Accepting Applications

The Jianghai Customs Visa Office began accepting applications from all sectors for permitted and prohibited imports last Saturday. Before the application forms are printed, they can be replaced by official letters. It is reported that the office has accepted applications for importing films, automobiles, sugar, tobacco leaves, and other items, especially the most applications for importing automobiles.

### Economic Briefs

According to the Fuel Management Committee, most of the coal-producing areas in the country have not been developed after the war. Currently, Shanghai's coal supply relies solely on Qinhuangdao, with approximately 100,000 tons shipped to Shanghai each month. The coal allocation method is to prioritize public utilities, followed by private factories.

### American Asphalt Felt Ships Arrive, Flattening Market Prices

(Report from this newspaper) A large quantity of American asphalt felt arrived in early February. Due to various uncompleted procedures, the shipment was delayed and could not be released until recently, when it began to spread into the market in large quantities. As a result, prices gradually declined, nearly doubling the drop. Currently, No. 2 asphalt felt is selling for 25,000 yuan per roll.

In order to promote cultural exchange, the post office has now resumed accepting books, magazines, printed matter, and other items to the following locations. It is reported that each person can send two items each time, with a weight limit of 200 cm per item. It is reported that the areas where the post office has resumed accepting are Dongchuan, Xichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, Tianjin (Jinbo Section), Beiping (Pingshi Section), Shandong (except Qingdao), Shanxi, and all locations along the Beining Railway.

Commentary

### Preliminary Suggestions for Enhancing Tea Production

— Zhu Yanqing

Economic construction should first focus on increasing production. The scope of increasing production is extremely broad, with some starting from industry and others from agriculture. Our country is vast and rich in resources, and agricultural products are abundant. Although industrialization has been highly emphasized recently, industrial raw materials still cannot but be derived from agricultural products. Our country's agricultural products have traditionally been dominated by silk, tea, tung oil, etc. in foreign trade, and tea in particular is a necessity for daily use both domestically and internationally, so let's talk about tea first.

Chinese tea has many characteristics and is highly cherished by people in Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. It is only because Chinese people are accustomed to old practices and rarely conduct research, and the international market is frequently subjected to artificial obstacles such as "exclusion" and "dumping," that the export of tea has repeatedly risen and fallen. Now that obstacles in international trade are gradually being eliminated, at this time, if the government provides guidance and merchants are self-motivated, the sales of Chinese tea should not be difficult to gradually restore to their former glory.

The tea-producing areas of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, although promoted by the government, are still small in quantity. The remaining tea-producing areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi have mostly suffered from military attacks, and production has been greatly reduced. The free areas are also experiencing stagnation in sales due to traffic obstructions. Stored tea has piled up like mountains, with many instances of deterioration. Therefore, those engaged in this industry are all in a state of anxiety and cannot recover on their own. Now, in the autumn of economic construction, industrial and agricultural loans have been repeatedly organized by the government. The Shanghai Foreign Tea Industry Association has also applied for loans to the Four Joint Offices in writing, and has been approved to send representatives from the association to negotiate with the China and Farmers' Banks. Although the methods and quantities are still under negotiation, we hope that it will be realized quickly.

In addition to loans, there are several points that cannot be accomplished without official and civilian cooperation. (1) After obtaining loans, tea farmers and tea workers should strive to improve, such as cultivation, picking, baking, and packaging, all of which should be coordinated with export sales. Absolutely do not allow crude production, self-interest, and damage to overseas credibility. (2) Tea merchants should also diligently seek information on foreign markets to serve as a benchmark for production and sales. (3) In terms of exchange rates, there are generally two points worth noting: (1) those applicable to remittances to the interior, and (2) those applicable to the settlement of foreign exchange for tea exports in Chinese legal tender. If banks can reduce exchange fees as much as possible and relax settlement as much as possible, then increased procurement and promotion will naturally benefit. (4) In terms of transportation, from the production area to Shanghai, traffic is not fully open, and there are still many obstructions in various transshipments. The government should issue a notice to all land and water transportation institutions, such as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Shanghai-Nanjing railways, the Jiujiang-Ningbo ships, and highway automobiles, to provide transportation tools and facilitate them as much as possible, so that tea leaves can arrive in Shanghai as soon as possible, and can be exported as soon as possible. (5) In terms of warehousing, the nature of tea is not suitable for humidity, nor is it suitable for storing with other salty and fishy goods, so as to avoid flavor changes. Nowadays, there is a shortage of houses everywhere, not only in the production area to Shanghai, there are very few suitable warehouses along the way, but also many of the Shanghai warehouses have their fragrances and odors mixed up, and have been disorganized for a long time. This requires cooperation from many parties to facilitate storage. (6) There are many reasons for the decline of foreign trade, and the lack of diplomatic assistance is also one of them. It is either subject to import bans or subject to heavy taxes and price suppression. This has been frequently heard in the past, and Japanese tea is especially a strong competitor of Chinese tea. Fortunately, the power of Japanese tea is not as strong as before. The government should issue a notice to its consulates and commercial counselors stationed abroad to conduct investigations and provide information at any time. If any country has deliberately suppressed or hindered it, it should also strive to coordinate and reduce its current difficulties, which is to increase its competitive power.

The above points may not be exhaustive, but if we want to promote tea production and expand tea sales, I believe that it is not easy to be effective without advancing in multiple directions.

### Cotton Cloth Merchant Threatened with Extortion; One Pair of Gold Bracelets Not Enough; Police in Disguise Arrest Bandits in the Oriental Hotel

(Report from this newspaper) Cotton cloth merchant Zhao Guanyun lives at No. 16 Wenyuan Lane, South Tibet Road. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, three people in uniform suddenly came, claiming to be military police. They said that Zhao was suspected of being a traitor and demanded 1 million yuan in cash to settle the matter. Zhao said that he did not have such a large amount of legal tender, so he politely asked to replace it with two gold bracelets. The three people left with the bracelets. In the afternoon, a call suddenly came, saying that the value of the gold bracelets was not enough for 1 million, and that he had to bring more money to Room 216 of the Oriental Hotel to pay the balance. Zhao immediately reported to the Taishan Branch, and Zhang Rou, the chief of the Judicial Section, led four police officers in disguise to the hotel, where they arrested all the bandits and seized a pistol, which was taken to the bureau for investigation.

### Welfare Foundation Established

The China Welfare Foundation Committee has been declared established under the leadership of Ms. Soong Ching Ling. The address of the association has been determined to be Room 201, No. 175 Suzhou Road. The association is an international relief organization for saving the poor. It has now received sponsorship from Lady Seymour, wife of the British Ambassador to China, who has raised a large amount of money, and will perform the drama "The Great Wall" at the Lyceum Theatre as a fundraising event.

### Pre-War Government Bonds: So-Called "Separate Measures" Intended This Way

Since the financial authorities announced separate measures for the bonds issued before 1941, speculation has arisen in the Shanghai securities market. Some say that the government will pay with customs duties, while others say that they will be repaid with Sun Yat-sen notes. The most minimal observation is that the government may give considerable preferential treatment in consideration of the merchants' enthusiasm for bond tickets during the war. The speakers are numerous, and those who listen are moved. As a result, the market price of government bonds went from 100 to 1,000, and from 1,000 to 2,000. With this only bargaining chip, all are regarded as rare commodities. Recently, at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Commissioner Pan Gongzhan questioned the financial authorities. According to the Minister of Finance's reply on the 8th, the so-called separate measures are because most of the pre-war debts flowed into the occupied areas, and were looted by the enemy and puppets during the war. It is necessary to verify the looting situation and complete the registration procedures before payment can be restored. As for the payment of principal and interest on Sun Yat-sen notes, it is completely a rumor. (See Japanese newspaper special telegram for details) Speculators' dreams should now be awake.

### Thinking, Planning, Implementation

—

In the reading community, the work of thinking is very important. Several philosophers have asked: "Don't just read, think." The meaning is that reading alone does not produce any effect, only thinking can bring benefits. In fact, this work of thinking can be applied to business management.

Educated people can understand the relationship between an idea and a fact. After thinking of an idea, one must also think of everything around and behind it. Many wrong facts are caused by a wrong thought, so before making a decision, you must think carefully.

To create the power of thinking, reading is necessary. There is a maxim for reading that is worth adopting, that is, "Don't read good books, read the best books." Because a person's time is limited and cannot read all the books, so choosing those best books is the only way. Many great books, great people, great problems, and great doctrines are the crystallization of thought.

In business management, "a good beginning is half the work done" is very accurate. Therefore, thinking, planning, and implementation can be said to be the necessary steps for dealing with every kind of matter.

### A Few Humble Suggestions for Improving the Dyeing and Weaving Industry

— Da Kang

Since the dyeing and weaving industry was forcibly bought by the enemy and puppets in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], its vitality has been greatly damaged. Afterwards, it could only be replaced by the manufacture of cotton and hemp yarn or rayon interwoven with silk, in order to avoid control. The factories themselves were able to barely survive, and the workers were also able to maintain a livelihood, so as not to be dragged into the whirlpool of shutdowns and unemployment. However, during the enemy and puppet period, excessive taxes and levies were imposed layer upon layer, which further aggravated the desperate situation. But the dyeing and weaving industry still hoped to endure hardships, withstand the pressure, and barely overcome difficulties, waiting for the arrival of light to relieve pent-up grievances. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, and the rivers and mountains have been restored, the long-cherished wish has been fulfilled. Moreover, as the government vigorously implements post-war recovery, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has stipulated that electricity for factory production should be supplied as much as possible, so that the injuries suffered over the past eight years can be restored. However, it is felt that the dyeing and weaving industry has always lacked a long-term vision, focusing only on the present, which has led to numerous difficulties and created serious barriers between the industry. This has enabled the enemy and puppets to take advantage of the opportunity, implement compulsory purchases, and deal a head-on blow, destroying the foundations of the dyeing and weaving industry that had been painstakingly built up over decades. Is this not painful? Therefore, based on my humble opinion, the areas that should be improved are described as follows:

(1) Business Competition: In the past, among the member manufacturers of the dyeing and weaving industry, few were able to operate self-dyeing and self-weaving with dyeing and weaving machinery. Most of them only purchased white fabric for dyeing or dyed fabric for customers, or wove various colors of fabric, with a bias towards one of these options. Therefore, small and medium-sized dyeing and weaving factories accounted for the majority, and their business operations were largely similar, crowding into one area, leading to competition among the same industry. Competition in business led to jealousy. In fact, there should be a spirit of concession. If one wants to seize everything for exclusive occupation, this kind of trust policy will inevitably fail. This is the first area that should be improved.

(2) Worker Treatment: During the War of Resistance, the increase in the proportion of salaried classes was the most backward. Compared with the multiple increases in the cost of living index, there was a clear difference between heaven and earth. Due to the surge in prices, the burden on workers became heavier and heavier. They were constantly worried, which affected their peace of mind at work. Therefore, the treatment of workers should be improved as much as possible, enough to support their families, so that they have no worries at home and no longer have to worry about the seven necessities of life [fuel, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea]. Indirectly, the benefits to the factory will be invisibly enhanced. This is the second area that should be improved.

(3) Labor Welfare: The treatment of laborers in our country is insignificant compared to that of European and American countries. They can enjoy the "3-8 System," that is, eight hours of work, eight hours of education, and eight hours of sleep, which improves work efficiency. In contrast, the wages earned by laborers in our country day and night are not enough to support their families. The mental and material suffering they endure is countless. Therefore, we should also follow the previous example and seek a certain amount of rest time for laborers, and then instill knowledge to correct their thinking. This can also avoid the reckless actions of reactionary strikes incited by the outside world. Wouldn't this benefit both the factory and the laborers? This is what should be improved.

In summary, if we want the development of Chinese industry, not only should those in charge of the dyeing and weaving industry think big and not seek small profits (the so-called "being penny-wise and pound-foolish") and advocate it in the front, but those engaged in the industry should also abide by their positions, strive for development, and cooperate harmoniously. This will surely lead to the prosperity of the industry. It is hoped that the dyeing and weaving industry will recognize this early and not take it lightly.

### The Future of Seasoning Manufacturing Plants - Visiting Mr. Yao Junzhi of Standard Flavor Powder Factory

— Fei Wen

Chinese cuisine has always been famous for its freshness and deliciousness. The fundamental difference between Chinese cuisine and foreign cuisine is that Chinese cuisine has already completed the seasoning work, while foreign cuisine only begins seasoning when it is eaten. Therefore, Chinese housewives pay very close attention to the application of seasonings.

In the past, Ajinomoto of Japan occupied the Chinese market and absorbed a large amount of surplus money from China. Later, although the seasoning products produced by the Chinese themselves gradually increased, Ajinomoto still sold in the Chinese market.

However, the situation will be completely different in the future. The Chinese and Southeast Asian markets will be completely markets for domestically produced Chinese seasonings. Therefore, as long as a seasoning manufacturing plant has established a foundation in the past and has a good reputation, it can develop on a large scale, and its future is limitless.

When the Standard Flavor Powder Factory was established seven years ago, it was during the August 13th Anti-Japanese War. The intention was that the war would eventually stop, and if we buried ourselves in hard work and won the praise of society, it would not be difficult to seek development after the war. Even during the war, it would be very worthwhile to sacrifice all assets as long as we could obtain a good business reputation. Therefore, when the raw materials for flavor powder were cut off and production could not continue, we issued "Xian Da Wang" soy sauce to contribute to families throughout the city.

Now that the war is over, we are embarking on the road of construction. However, what lies before us is not a smooth road, but a road full of thorns. At present, most factories lack manpower and financial resources, so the first step is to solve the manpower and financial resources. In terms of financial resources, we hope that people in the community who are interested in industry and care about the national economy and people's livelihood will invest. This kind of investment may not necessarily obtain unexpected windfall profits, but under a large cycle of factory development and stable people's livelihood, the benefits that can be obtained are not difficult to imagine. In terms of manpower, then each shareholder, in addition to investing, can also contribute their strength. Originally, the biggest advantage of the limited company organization is that it concentrates talent and can engage in cooperation. In this era when construction is more important than everything, the limited company should further develop its organizational strength. This point, it is hoped that the shareholders who invest in various limited companies will give it deeper consideration.

### Mexico's Efforts in Construction

— Original by Michael Scully, Translated by Xu Baiyi

Worthy of Reference for Our Country's Industrial Circles

Mexico is a backward country, but in recent years, it has been working hard to improve and rectify itself, and it is very different from before. Therefore, when a traveler arrives in Mexico City to travel, if he hopes to see the kind of leisurely and romantic atmosphere as before, he will definitely be greatly disappointed. On the surface, we can still see those 18th-century buildings and the quaint Mexican character, but at the same time, we can more easily and quickly feel the busy traffic. Everywhere, we can see buildings using steel windows, and the roads are wider than before, just like Detroit City in 1920. The population is also increasing rapidly. In 1930, the city's population was less than one million, but it is now close to two million.

A traveler who is new to Mexico City can see many complex and intricate living conditions. Some people can buy shirts for seven dollars each, hats for twenty dollars, and suits for fifty dollars, but there are also many people who live in simple houses, have housing disputes, have black markets and other crimes. At the same time, he can also hear calls for a shortage of labor, the construction of a great hospital, and the near completion of a large sluice.

Mexico was going to embark on the road to industrialization long ago. When 1910 came, it was about to embark on the road to industrialization, but a revolution suddenly occurred, delaying the work for ten years. Then came the world depression, so true progress only began in 1930. The greatest impetus was generated by President Cárdenas, who forcibly invested many people's money in factories and construction projects. He completely nationalized the national railways, oil industry, and other industries, and managed and operated them by great national organizations. Therefore, many people had to live in Mexico City and needed family clothes, food, and all other supplies. However, because he did not take into account the result of many farmers abandoning agriculture and taking up industry, he was once troubled by the surplus of labor and the increase in the number of unemployed.

When the Second World War began, Mexico had to start manufacturing things that had always been imported from abroad. In order to encourage production, since 1941, the government exempted newly established factories from taxes and import duties for five years, thus creating the greatest opportunity for revival. In order to escape the high taxes in their own country, American capital flowed into Mexico in large quantities. The capital that had flowed out of Mexico to foreign countries flowed back into the country. The large-scale purchases by the United States further increased the amount of investment. They also built factories in the fields around Mexico, and the country invested 10 million US dollars to build steel mills, oil refineries, power plants, and water conservancy projects. In 1944, the total investment of national capital was 32 million yuan, which increased to 60 million yuan in 1945. In mid-September 1945, there was a largest enterprise organization with a total capital of 15 million yuan, which was the Wei Shi Ding Hao Electric Factory. American and Mexican bankers jointly invested in it, purchased 160 acres of land near Mexico City, and prepared to manufacture radios, electric refrigerators, electric irons, washing machines, and many other electrical appliances. The allocation of capital was 51% for Mexico and 49% for the United States.

Due to this facility, foreigners have more trust in Mexico, and various local industries are also increasing. In 1931, the entire Mexican film industry only produced two amateur films. In 1944, 83 films were produced in Mexican studios, with a total profit of 76 million yuan, becoming the third largest source of national income. At the same time, the publishing industry also increased sixfold compared to ten years ago, and the output of silverware manufacturing, textiles, and other products reached a number that had never been dreamed of.

Of course, Mexico still has its own difficult problems. Because there is an excess of 350 million yuan of currency, it has formed a state of inflation. The price of real estate has risen tenfold, and other things continue to increase. Even daily necessities have increased by two and a half times compared to 1940.

However, Mexico's future is optimistic, because of the following reasons:

(1) The government has sufficient financial resources to make its ideals a reality and will continue to adopt a cooperative approach with foreign capital. Since 1940, the government has taken care of farmers in the same way as it has taken care of workers, allowing them to have farmland.

(2) Mexico's industry has embarked on the road to electrification. Because Mexico produces very little coal, it uses oil and other substances to generate electricity. Two large power plants have been built in Mexico City. Water conservancy projects are also actively underway.

(3) The Mexican government knows that future development must first make transportation convenient, so it is also actively carrying out railway and road work.

(4) In order to absorb new knowledge, special technical personnel are sent to the United States to study. They themselves are also gradually able to transform and train many engineers and scientists.
