### Military Trio Held Meeting Yesterday: Discussing Concrete Reorganization Methods, Transportation Ceasefire at the Center of Discussion

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 9th] The Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai military trio held their first meeting of the new year on the morning of the 9th. It is reported that matters of principle had already been exchanged and coordinated separately before the meeting, ensuring proper arrangements. The principles are divided into two parts: one is the assessment of military reorganization for gradual implementation, and the other is mixed organization. The discussion today focused on concrete implementation methods, centering on restoring transportation and the completion of conflict mediation by the Peiping Executive Headquarters and various executive groups, seeking agreements between both sides. In the future, after the restoration of transportation, all transportation lines will be handed over for civilian use, and military use will not be permitted. Colonel Baud's arrival was to report to Special Envoy Marshall on the progress of conflict mediation by the Peiping Executive Headquarters and various regions, and to request instructions on unresolved matters. After this meeting, the trio will reportedly inspect various ceasefire zones, and then proceed to Peiping.

[Our Peiping Correspondent, 8th] The work of the mediation force has recently encountered significant obstacles in Shandong, Chifeng, and transportation issues. (1) The Communist forces consider the defending troops in Taian and Zhangdian, Shandong, as puppet troops and do not allow them to receive food supplies. Yesterday, a train carrying food to Taian from Jinan was looted by people under the leadership of the Communist forces. The executive department has dispatched an additional team today to resolve this incident and has requested instructions from Chairman Chiang. The official side stated that the defending troops in Taian and Zhangdian are government security forces and not puppet troops. In fact, they fought hard during the War of Resistance. (2) The Chifeng security team is a force under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. According to the executive department's order of the 27th of last month, they should withdraw from participating in management and guarding, and the scope is not limited to north of the Yangtze River but also includes south of the Yangtze. The government side believes that all road administration in the country must be unified under the management of the Ministry of Transportation. The situation is currently deadlocked.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The trio meeting composed of Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai was held at 10:00 AM on the 9th and lasted until 2:00 PM. Major General Baud, head of the executive group of the military mediation executive department, also participated, and discussed various issues in detail. It is reported that some agreements have been reached.

### Troops, Whether Called Puppet Troops or Not, Must All Obey Ceasefire Orders: Temporary Directive Issued by the Mediation Executive Department

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 9th] The press release group of the Military Mediation Executive Department issued Joint Announcement No. 9 on the 9th. Peiping, February 9th. The difficulties faced by the Military Mediation Executive Department, which were quite serious, have been resolved after the issuance of a temporary directive. The directive was addressed to the commanding officers of various executive groups, the government, and the Chinese Communist Party, stipulating that all troops, whether called puppet troops or not, should be included within the scope of the ceasefire order. This order was finalized after repeated discussions by the heads of the various executive sections of the Mediation Executive Department, and was approved by the three committee members yesterday before being telegraphed to the various executive groups, troop commanders, and Chongqing. The original text is as follows: All troops, whether called puppet troops or not, if recognized by the government or the Chinese Communist Party, fall within the scope of the ceasefire order. These troops and the troops opposing them should maintain the positions held at 24:00 on January 13th, or maintain the positions determined by the executive group if necessary. This is a temporary measure. All issues regarding the status of the troops will await the final decision of the trio committee. The provision to include the above-mentioned troops in the overall ceasefire order will be of practical help in resolving local problems, especially in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan, because in those areas, the above-mentioned troops have become a rather serious obstacle to reaching agreements between government and Chinese Communist military commanders. Robertson, Chairman of the Mediation Executive Department Committee, expressed deep appreciation today for the spirit of cooperation among the heads of the various executive sections regarding this agreement, and said: The spirit of cooperation shown by Major General Song Shilun, head of the Chinese Communist Executive Section, and Major General Zhou Miewu, head of the Government Executive Section, in deciding this issue should be highly commended. Their constant discussions with Lieutenant Colonel Ete have resulted in an agreement that will greatly help in fulfilling the mission of the Executive Department. The government and Chinese Communist representatives here have once again expressed their sincerity and determination to implement the agreements of the Chongqing trio meeting.

[United Press, Chongqing, 9th] A Communist Party spokesperson stated that the Communist Party does not intend to compromise on the issue of restoring transportation, but he believes that the Taian crisis is not serious and can be resolved within days. He also stated that the Communist Party allows Japanese and puppet troops to pass through Communist-occupied areas, but these troops must first be disarmed. He also stated that after the Taian puppet troops are disarmed, the Communist forces are willing to withdraw from the area to show that they have no intention of occupying the city. Regarding the issue of disarming the puppet troops, the Communist Party is willing to abide by the decision of the trio committee. If the trio committee decides that the Communist forces should disarm the puppet troops, then the Communist forces will simultaneously take over the city of Taian. However, if the trio committee agrees to joint action by all three parties, then representatives from the American side, the government, and the Communist Party will be sent to take over the city.

Once an agreement is reached, they will return to Shandong with the Taian team to work. Also, the Jinan group, due to the lack of coal in Jinan City, has agreed with the Chinese Communist representatives to allow coal to be transported from the Zibo mining area to Jinan. The provincial authorities have sent personnel to collect the coal, and the coal shortage in Jinan City is expected to be resolved.

### After Ceasefire Order Takes Effect: Communist Forces Still Moving Constantly, Occupying 46 Cities, Towns, and Stations

A responsible authority told reporters that after the ceasefire order took effect, the Communist forces continued to move towards the railway lines, forming an encirclement.

The replies have arrived in Nanjing one after another since January.

Among the plaintiffs, there are those who lost their relatives to enemy and puppet violence, or whose property was burned and looted by enemies and puppets, leaving them unable to make a living, and families of anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians who are struggling to make a living.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Byrnes told the press yesterday that he had not yet received formal confirmation from the Chinese side regarding the Soviet Union's request to China for economic concessions in the three eastern provinces.

### Fushun Coal Mine Receiving Committee Member Zhang Xinfu Tragically Murdered; All Eight Members of Delegation Killed by Armed Forces; Soviet Side Formally Notifies Zhang Jia'ao

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th (Urgent Telegram)] Regarding the report of the assassination of Zhang Xinfu, Acting Northeast Special Envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, confirmation has now been obtained. In recent days, varying rumors have circulated in Nanjing, Chongqing, and Beijing. This newspaper's reporter spent two days conducting extensive investigations and learned that Zhang was indeed murdered on January 16th while accompanying Soviet personnel from Shenyang to Fushun to negotiate the takeover of the coal mines in that area. At that time, the Fushun mining area was already under the control of the Communist forces. Initially, when Zhang's sudden disappearance was reported, rumors spread in the north that Zhang had been detained, and it was heard that after being detained, he was sent by the Communist forces to Changchun. Relevant parties in Nanjing and Chongqing have indeed received reports of this. The details are currently being investigated and inquired into thoroughly. According to those familiar with the recent situation in the Northeast, the fact of Zhang's murder appears at first glance to be extremely mysterious and shocking, but given the present day and Zhang's position, this kind of incident is not unexpected. Fushun mining area is the largest coal mine in the country, with recent annual production reaching a huge 8 million tons. In the past, in addition to supplying all the needs of the South Manchurian Railway, a huge amount could also be transported out to supply the power needs of some factories in Japan. Zhang Xinfu himself was one of China's leading mining experts, already enjoying a great reputation before the war. After the war, he presided over the Mercury Mine Management Office in western Hunan and northeastern Guizhou provinces, achieving considerable success. Two years ago, he presided over the largest mining area in southern Jiangxi, making many achievements. Zhang was originally from the Northeast. This time, he went to the Northeast to participate in the takeover work, initially serving as a specialist in the office of Special Envoy Sun Yueqi, and was recently appointed to this position. At this critical moment in the nation's reconstruction, it is unfortunate that he died for the sake of national construction. Surely not only the entire mining industry will mourn his loss!

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] Zhang Xinfu, a member of the Ministry of Economic Affairs receiving committee who went to Fushun to take over the coal mines, was murdered on the way from Fushun to Shenyang. Also killed at the same time were his entourage Xu Changqing, Liu Cichun, Niu Junzhang, Zhang Shede, and three police officers. Details are being investigated. According to reports, Zhang left Changchun for Fushun on January 7th accompanied by Lieutenant General Maliyi, assistant vice-chairman of the railway, traveling by train. He stayed in Shenyang for several days while General Maliyi contacted the Soviet troops stationed in Fushun, before departing for Fushun. After arriving in Fushun, he telephoned Shenyang, saying that he had lost his freedom. Afterwards, his whereabouts were unknown until January 20th, when a report was received stating that Zhang and his party of eight were taken off their special train at Lishizhai station on the evening of the 16th, while returning to Shenyang, and were all stabbed to death outside the station in a very tragic manner. Regarding this matter, the Soviet side formally notified Chairman Zhang Jia'ao, saying that they were killed by 300 armed troops and that the bodies had been found.

The Headquarters Committee discussed this matter today, and the New York and anti-New York factions are gradually deploying their positions. The split in the battle lines originated between the five major powers. On the one hand, the Soviet Union, Britain, and China support New York City as the temporary headquarters, with the Stamford Greenwich area as the permanent headquarters. On the other hand, France suggests that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lai Yi, should select a temporary headquarters in a location where temporary facilities are readily available, and the permanent headquarters will be decided when the United Nations General Assembly reconvenes in September.

[Associated Press, London, 9th] When the Security Council of the United Nations meets at 5:00 PM today (1:00 AM Sunday, Shanghai time), Ukraine's complaint against the British troops stationed in Indonesia may be withdrawn. The Ukrainian representative, Manuelski, may not be able to attend due to a cold, thus delaying the resolution of the case. However, there are various signs indicating that major representative countries have already held consultations, leading many to believe that the complaint will be withdrawn. If Ukraine insists on its accusation, the Security Council must recommend sending a committee to Indonesia. At the same time, it is heard that the Netherlands is planning to issue a communique announcing the basic policy for resolving the Indonesian issue. The Dutch Foreign Minister revealed that good news will be coming soon.

### London Gala: Lord Mayor Hosts UN General Assembly Delegates; Entire Soviet Delegation Absent

[French News Agency, London, 8th] The Lord Mayor of London hosted a banquet at City Hall tonight to entertain delegates from various countries to the United Nations General Assembly. This was the first such banquet since 1939. The hall was newly decorated, and ceremonial guards in splendid uniforms stood by. Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vishinsky and other representatives of the country were not present. After the banquet, the ancient custom of passing the cup was held to show intimacy. First, the Lord Mayor touched the cup to his lips and then handed it to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Spaak, who then passed it to others until it had been passed to all the guests.

[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom and Chief Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, Dr. Gu Weijun, stated at a banquet of the Foreign Press Association in London: "The United Nations is still in its infancy, and its future is limitless." He praised the actions of the United Nations and predicted that the General Assembly has important work ahead. When discussing the mission of the press, Dr. Gu urged them to cooperate closely to become a medium between the member states of the United Nations and the public.

### Truman Calls for Support of His Plan to Prevent World Famine; Large Quantities of Food Arriving in Japan

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] President Truman called on all parties yesterday while hosting journalists to fully support his nine-point plan to prevent world famine. He stated: India's national rice production is 12 to 15 percent short of the usual average need. Japan's rice production is also 15 percent short of normal. The food situation in many parts of the East is even worse than in Europe. For example, the Philippines and the seed production has declined, comparing to being one-fifth lower than before the war. Since Japan's surrender, aid to China has been stepped up. China enjoys the highest priority in future shipments of relief goods. The President pointed out that before Japan's surrender, due to the lack of usable ports, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's shipments to China were severely restricted.

### US President Cancels Vacation Due to Heavy Workload

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] President Truman has decided not to leave Washington and has canceled his two-week vacation starting on Monday. According to a White House statement, the President's move is due to "the issues involved in the current crisis, which require personal attention." The statement also said that the President regretted postponing his meeting with Churchill.

[Reuters, Miami, Florida, 9th] Mr. and Mrs. Churchill flew back here today from Havana, Brazil.

### Vietnamese Revolutionaries Attack Our Hanoi Garrison; Illegal Acts Against Our Overseas Chinese Occur Frequently; Chairman of the Provisional Government Says He Will Restrain the Vietnamese People

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 8th] In various parts of northern Vietnam, Vietnamese revolutionaries have recently committed illegal acts against our overseas Chinese, and the lives and property of our overseas Chinese have suffered huge losses directly and indirectly. On the 5th, when our garrison was carrying out a mission in Phu Luong Trang, 50 kilometers from Hanoi, they were attacked by armed elements of the Vietnamese Provisional Government. Our authorities, since there are no normal diplomatic relations with the Vietnamese government, cannot lodge protests with them, so they have ordered their subordinates to strengthen defenses and effectively protect overseas Chinese in various places. This reporter specifically visited Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnamese Provisional Government, to inquire about the handling of the matter by the Vietnamese side. According to him, Ho expressed deep regret after the occurrence of cases of Vietnamese people violating the lives and property of overseas Chinese. It is said that the Vietnamese government sent personnel to the scene of the incident to investigate and confirm the facts, and they have joined our garrison in punishing the perpetrators. Ho also told reporters that he will strictly restrain the Vietnamese people in the future so that similar unfortunate events will not happen again.

### Allied Control of Japan and Germany to Take 15 Years; Peace Treaties Cannot Be Signed Until Next Year; Paris Peace Conference Convened in May

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] US Secretary of State Byrnes said today that he will recommend that the three powers conclude peace treaties with the Balkan small countries, and then begin preparing peace treaties with Japan and Germany. Byrnes believes that the treaties with Japan and Germany can be completed within a year or 18 months. He said that the peace treaty with Japan is easier to draft because Japan has a government, while it may take some time for Germany to have a government. Byrnes recalled the words of the late Roosevelt: "Before Japan can live peacefully with its neighbors, it may take 15 years or more. The Allied countries must occupy and supervise Germany and Japan until the above-mentioned period, so as to ensure that they fulfill the provisions of the treaty." He then requested the cancellation of his proposal made at the Moscow conference to hold a tripartite foreign ministers' meeting in Washington in April, as they are planning to meet at the Paris Peace Conference in May.

### International Building: Silent Like a Museum

[Reuters, Bear City, 9th] The United Nations General Assembly is in full swing in London, but the building of the former League of Nations in Geneva is tightly shut, with no sound, silent like a museum. From the avenue in front of the building to the courtyards inside, the assembly hall and the committee rooms, there are no traces of people.

### A Pioneering Event on the New York Stage: Performance of "Pipa Ji"

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th Special Dispatch] A Chinese classical drama performed by American actors has premiered at a Broadway theater, which is a pioneering event in New York theater history. The play is called "Pipa Ji," with the famous singer and actress Mary Martin playing the female lead Zhao Wuniang. The Broadway "Pipa Ji" script is based on Bazin's 1841 French translation. The play uses Chinese costumes and background, and five-fifths of the play is singing. Most New York theater critics criticized the performance, saying it was gorgeous and dazzling, more so than the drama. However, the introduction of "Pipa Ji" to Broadway is a pioneering event in which Chinese drama is entirely performed by actors.

### Truman Refuses to Pardon Yamashita, Who Has Lost All Hope; First War Criminal in Hong Kong, Nagano, Escorted to Custody

[United Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman today refused to pardon General Yamashita Tomoyuki, and the fate of the Manila killer has been decided, with no way to save him. The President did not even issue a formal rejection of Yamashita's last-minute request, but simply sent a secretary to verbally inform reporters that the President did not want to take any action. At the same time, the War Department was also happy and informed MacArthur of the President's intentions. Therefore, the temporary suspension of the execution order was naturally canceled.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 8th] Colonel Nagano, the former commander of the Japanese Kempeitai, is the first war criminal in Hong Kong. During the Japanese occupation, his headquarters was no different from hell on earth, making those who heard of it change color. In 1943, he executed 33 Chinese and Europeans, which was his greatest crime. Nagano was transferred away from Hong Kong a year ago and arrived in Hong Kong today by ship from Japan. Nagano had removed his military uniform and was wearing a neatly ironed brown casual suit. He carried his suitcase into the waiting truck in a pretentious manner and quickly drove to Stanley Prison for imprisonment. Other accomplices had already been detained in the prison. The date of the trial has not yet been decided. According to news obtained here a week ago, when Nagano was powerful in Hong Kong, he lived with a Chinese mistress in a certain residence requisitioned by the Japanese army. The mistress had been paraded through the streets of Guangzhou in full dress, and was escorted to the suburbs for execution.

### Snake: The Latest Effective Weapon for Clearing Landmines

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] At the end of the European War, the US military used a new weapon specifically for clearing landmines called "Snake." When the US military advanced, "Snake" could cut the electric wires, causing the landmines to explode in advance. The new weapon is a long metal gun filled with high explosives with a pear-shaped metal "nose," guided to its destination by a light tank. It can cross or detour around rocks or large trees. "Snake" is 400 feet long, 14 inches wide, and 5 inches high, weighing approximately 900 pounds, including 4,480 pounds of high explosives. It has parallel detonating cords sandwiched between crimped aluminum sheets.

### "Sunset Empire" Snapshot: The Most Realistic Problems are Food and Clothing

— Canglong

Mr. Song Dehe, the Tokyo correspondent for the Central News Agency, gracefully flew from Tokyo to Shanghai a few days ago. He brought with him a snapshot of the "Sunset Empire" after its surrender. The reporter, with eager anticipation, wanted to reproduce this fresh snapshot in its entirety to share it with everyone.

Mr. Song, dressed from head to toe in the attire of an American war correspondent, humbly said, "I saw too many things; I don't know where to begin." He lit a cigarette and, through the swirling smoke, recounted fragments of Japan.

He first raised the most realistic problem facing Japan today: that is, the Japanese have no guarantee of food or clothing. Therefore, any snapshot invariably contains the word "suffering." Many large cities were severely bombed, leading to housing problems.

Japan's political system and the institutions of the military and financial cliques collapsed entirely with this surrender. At the end of March this year, after the general election, Japan's political system can be said to have achieved preliminary success. As for the future direction, it will depend on the thinking of their political leaders. The Japanese people now have a great deal of freedom, but most of them do not know how to use it. Centuries of traditional thought have bound the Japanese people, causing them to follow the government's orders in everything they do. He said that this kind of thinking urgently needs to be reformed.

Currently, the more prominent political parties active in Japan are the Republican Party, the Socialist Party, the Progressive Party, and the Liberal Party, among others. The latter two parties are reorganized from former old parties. Recently, the Republican Party and the Socialist Party have had intense competition. It seems that the Socialist Party has gained an advantage and is relatively stronger. It is said that this party was formed by merging three small parties before the war.

Japan's luck can be said to be very good because General MacArthur is more than fair in everything he does for them! At present, Japan's financial problems are very difficult. Although it is said that the costs of the Allied occupation of Japan must be supplied by Japan, the expenditure on these occupation costs is only about 140 million yuan per month, less than one-tenth of Japan's monthly military expenditure during the war. Therefore, according to the Japanese calculation, it is hoped that the domestic debt of the country can be repaid within six years. As for foreign reparations, it is said that the issue is too complicated and remains to be studied. Because of the lack of various raw materials such as silk, cotton, and wool, and because the workers in Kyushu and Hokkaido are unwilling to work, the coal in these two places has not been mined. Therefore, most of the factories in Japan are unable to produce. Machines are idle, and chimneys no longer emit smoke.

The reporter couldn't help but ask him about the situation after the Japanese nationals returned to their country. He said: "When Japanese nationals return to their country, they will first encounter the housing problem. Leaving aside the problems of food and clothing, the problem of employment after returning to the country cannot be solved. Although there is still a rationing system now, the rations are only half of what they used to be because of the scarcity of goods. Those who have a little money get their supplies from the black market. A small five-inch-long fish in the black market sells for more than ten yen, equivalent to more than sixty cents in US dollars; the market price of rice in the black market is thirty-two times higher than the official price. Residents in big cities are all under severe threat, while people in the countryside are relatively better off because they have production."

Therefore, a very strange phenomenon has occurred in Japan: it is difficult for people in the city to find jobs, but everyone is unwilling to find jobs. For example, there are more than 700,000 unemployed people in Tokyo. At that time, several factories needed more than 30,000 people, but no one went. The factory wage is only a dozen yen a day, just enough to buy a five-inch-long fish from the black market. As a result, these people all ran to the countryside to buy radishes, green vegetables, rice, and the like, and then sold them in the black market in the city, earning just enough to make a living. I told him that this kind of "small business" was also very popular in Shanghai during the enemy-puppet occupation. The taste of it is now the Japanese' turn to experience!

Mr. Song also said: "The people in Japan are very unhappy with their 'Imperial Army' that did not die and return. At first, they were blinded by the warlords and indulged in the high-sounding rhetoric of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' all day long, listening to the illustrious battle records of the 'Imperial Army.' When the news of the surrender was announced, they realized that everything they had heard in the past was just a mirage. They forced a smile when they sent the 'Imperial Army' out on expeditions and invasions in batches, but now they hang their heads dejectedly, greeting their return with aversion. This exposes the Japanese people's depressed and painful psychology after being deceived!"

During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Song, in the guise of a reporter, traveled all over the world. He also visited many important battlefields in the motherland, such as Taierzhuang. He left his footprints in Vietnam, India, Burma, Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. After the end of the war with the Allied forces attacking Italy, he followed the US aircraft carrier Task Force 58, landing successively in New Guinea, New Britain, Saipan, Guam, Luzon Island in the Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. On the way, he went to the United States to cover the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. After Japan's surrender, he landed with the American army near Yokohama and has been there ever since.

### Local Dispatches

Minhang

Military Discipline Inspection Group Visits and Inspects: A group of fifteen people from the Military Discipline Inspection Group of the Military Commission, led by Director Wu Cangzhou, a lieutenant general, and Chen Linrong, a lieutenant general, arrived in Minhang at around 11:00 am yesterday (the 8th). Xu, the magistrate of Shanghai County, upon hearing the news, immediately greeted them and summoned the heads of various departments and all staff members, requesting them to give instructions in the county government auditorium. After Magistrate Xu delivered a welcome speech, the heads of various departments successively reported on the work situation of each department. Then, Director Wu gave a speech to the entire staff, inquiring in detail about the county's administrative plan and hoping to establish a new lifestyle and reverse the declining trends.

Kunshan

The Postal Workers' Slowdown Resolved: Postal workers in our county once slowed down work the day before yesterday. The reason was that the salaries of postal workers in bureaus outside Shanghai differed greatly from those in the Shanghai area, so they demanded that the bureau increase the salary of each postal worker to 70,000 yuan (the monthly salary of postal workers in Kunshan was 40,000 yuan). This matter has now been successfully resolved. Starting from the 7th, normal service has resumed.

Changshu

The District Head is Accused of Dereliction of Duty and Sent to Court for Trial: Wu Bin, the head of the second district in our county, has made no achievements since taking office. Now, the county government has found evidence of dereliction of duty and ordered his arrest. After strict interrogation, the suspect will be transferred to the local court for prosecution.

Wuxi

District Boundaries Restored to Pre-War State: During the enemy-puppet era, the boundaries of districts, townships, and towns in the entire county of Xiyi were handled entirely by the enemy-puppet regime, resulting in chaotic boundaries. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, County Magistrate Fan Tisheng, in accordance with the demobilization measures, first restored the district boundaries to their original state before the 26th year of the Republic (1937), and then gradually restored the township and town boundaries. However, the boundaries of Tonghan Town outside the Guangfu Gate and Beitang Town outside the North Gate have not been restored to their original state due to the machinations of some people. Yesterday, the county magistrate specially instructed Lian Wenxi, the head of the civil affairs section, to handle everything in accordance with the old case of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) and ordered the townships and towns to hand over as soon as possible to avoid disputes.

Nantong

A Large Number of Traitors Escorted to Suzhou for Trial: The local administrative commissioner's office has dispatched the security team to escort 28 traitors from the enemy-puppet era, including Yu Siliang and Zhang Xun, and two traitors detained by the local court, Wang Zhenbang (the president of the enemy-puppet Nantong Local Court) and Ma Yipo, to the Jiangsu High Court for trial. At that time, the families of the criminals, upon hearing the news, rushed to the gate of the Jiangsu Fourth Prison to wait and see them off with tears, a rather tragic scene.

Pinghu

The Suspension of County Taxes Affects Revenue and Expenditure: Since the county tax office in our county learned of the news that the new director was taking office, all collection offices have shown a state of suspension. All directors have resigned one after another, which has greatly affected the county government's finances. It is reported that the new Director Wang Shaorong convened a meeting of the heads of various departments yesterday and decided to give priority to the original tax collectors to start collecting taxes in order to avoid the suspension of tax revenue and affect the county government's revenue and expenditure.

Dangtu

Opening a Theater to Prosper the Market: Since the recovery, the security in our county has become more consolidated than before. The winter defense period and the Lunar New Year have all passed safely. A few days ago, local figures such as Mr. Li petitioned for the opening of a theater to seek proper entertainment and to prosper the market. The petition has been approved and formally opened on February 2nd.

### Enduring the Burden, Striving for Future Sweet Fruit: Looking Ahead to Xinjiang's Prospects: The Internal Problems of Various Ethnic Groups Should Be Resolved Quickly

— Special Report by Our Newspaper, Written by Zhu Minwei After Returning from Xinjiang

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was ordered by Director Jian of the Political Department of the Aviation Commission to go to Xinjiang on official business. Although the time I stayed in Xinjiang was not long, I had a lot of contact with people from all walks of life. Therefore, I would like to put forward some issues based on the impressions I gained from my own observations, which may be helpful for readers' reference.

Xinjiang is a border province, and there are also tens of thousands of Kazakhs causing trouble within the territory. Undoubtedly, the use of force has been a fact for a year. In the past year, the government has used troops, such as the infantry sent from the interior. These troops are stationed all along the line from the Jinghe front to Hami. As of September last year, they were still using the old system, old equipment, and old provisions (different from the new system after Minister Chen Cheng's military reorganization).

### The National Army Units in Xinjiang Province Must Adapt to the Characteristics of the Desert Region

Of course, before the victory, in order to cope with the war against Japan, it was impossible to send elite troops to Xinjiang Province for defense. However, Xinjiang Province is an important gateway to our country. Although its real value is not as great as that of the Northeast, its future prospects can provide a place for tens of thousands or even millions of Chinese people to live for a long time. Since it is a gateway, it doesn't make a good impression to have the internal security forces poorly dressed and underfed, and then suddenly go to war. Moreover, in the vast deserts of Xinjiang, how can they deal with the elusive Kazakh cavalry?

In terms of combat methods, the government troops have been in Xinjiang for a year, and all battles, large and small, have been defensive line or point defense battles. The other side always attacks or invades. This combat method is correct according to the entire national policy, because the government has no intention of war, let alone the intention to eliminate the Kazakhs. Only in order to protect the interests of all ethnic groups, stabilize their lives, and support the government's sovereignty, are the necessary troops stationed in the Kazakh-disturbed areas. Due to the combat methods and the characteristics of the cold desert region of Xinjiang, the reporter believes that the following points are worth paying attention to:

Since the troops stationed in Xinjiang are defensive and have no offensive meaning, the number does not need to be large. Too many troops, equipment, provisions, bases, and transportation will all cause problems. They cannot play a role in preventing the Kazakhs, but instead, they will put an excessive burden on the people.

The troops that have already entered Xinjiang Province must immediately implement the new system, equip them with new equipment, especially targeting the severe cold, wind, and snow in the cold desert region. Every soldier, horse, and car must be able to adapt to the local climate, and they must be given new provisions so that every soldier is a strong and elite soldier.

Long-term stationed strongholds, such as county towns and important points on transportation lines, should be mobilized to build barracks sufficient for the stationed troops. We must change the early habit of our Chinese troops living in the homes of the people wherever they go. If the lives of officers and soldiers are improved, they are fed and clothed, and when there is no war (defensive stationing and combat time are very short), they work to build barracks to avoid disturbing the people. This is the necessary behavior to give a good impression to all ethnic groups in the border province.

### Well-Fed and Strong Troops and Horses: The Emergency Situation May Turn Relaxed

If the above points can be achieved, I believe that the government will definitely not suffer any losses, and officers and soldiers can be well-fed, and people of all ethnic groups in the war zone can live in peace. What remains is that the elite troops can confront the isolated Kazakhs, and the military situation in Xinjiang Province will not be so serious as to implement the defense of Dihua. In the past, the emergency situation in Dihua once turned relaxed due to Minister Zhang Zhizhong's visit to Xinjiang for negotiations, but how the subsequent developments will be remains difficult to predict, and optimism is not warranted.

After most of the military problems are solved, it will be possible to carry out various administrative measures with more time. Chairman Wu once said in an interview with reporters that there is no serious ethnic struggle in Xinjiang. This can be seen in the following examples: In addition to the Han people who volunteer to serve in the military, the Xinjiang Provincial Government has stopped conscription. Therefore, all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have no military service burden. Economically, the government always does things that benefit the people, and taxes are not heavy. All ethnic groups seek free development in their respective economic activities and have no time or desire to engage in ethnic conflicts and struggles. Because Xinjiang is vast and sparsely populated, with abundant livestock and lush vegetation, the food, cotton, fruits, silk, wool, salt, and timber are enough to support the lives of Xinjiang's four million people of all ethnic groups. Although the Han people are not natives, they have never had conflicts due to race, economy, or religion with the Uyghur, Mongol, and other ethnic groups for decades. The Kazakh disturbances in the past year have only been due to the Kazakhs' long-standing habit of plundering. When they see others as weak, they become strong, followed by plundering. If other factors are added, it is easy to cause chaos. After the government has a small but elite troop to control them, there will be no major chaos. Therefore, the implementation of the entire Xinjiang administration has turned to one question: Will our government profit from Xinjiang? Or will our government subsidize Xinjiang in order to preserve the integrity of the country?

### Engaging in Civilizing Work: Enduring the Burden and Striving for Sweet Fruit

As far as the reporter's observations in Xinjiang are concerned, the people currently sent to Xinjiang by the central government are: troops, government officials, and technical personnel, medical personnel, teachers, etc. In addition, the government has issued the Xinjiang-only circulating New Xinjiang currency in Xinjiang (one New Xinjiang currency is equivalent to five legal currencies).

The government relies on its power and credit to attract paper money, which is exchanged for the production of the people of Xinjiang and the supply of the lives of military, political, educational, and technical personnel who come to Xinjiang. These new personnel in Xinjiang then engage in the civilizing work of Xinjiang to benefit the people and the country of Xinjiang. If it is said that the country's actions in Xinjiang can be profitable, then it can only be said that it has preserved this piece of land belonging to China for the country. But to do this well, it requires the central government to do it with all its strength, and it cannot be done simply by handing it over to the personnel who come to Xinjiang.

To benefit the people of Xinjiang, some achievements have already been made in Xinjiang's construction and education work, but the country still needs to bring new strength to irrigate it. We have this piece of land in Xinjiang, which is a burden for the country. Although it is not very profitable at the moment, it will be of great help to China's overall development in the future. Therefore, I believe that even though the country is currently experiencing difficulties everywhere in its recovery and is incurring huge costs, the policy of subsidizing Xinjiang should not be interrupted.

The implementation of the subsidy policy must endure the current burdens and seek future achievements.

### Selecting Those Who Go to Xinjiang: Avoid the Phenomenon of Talent Flowing Eastward

In terms of people, when the central government sends a new person to Xinjiang, it must select outstanding talents. Sending one person must give a warmth to all ethnic groups, making them inward-looking. The talents needed for Xinjiang's construction and education must be supplied continuously, and there should be no abnormal phenomenon of all talents flowing eastward during the recovery.

In terms of materials, the material needs of Xinjiang's construction period must be met as much as possible. For example, the four hundred tons of machinery from Xinjiang Xinfeng Textile Factory must be found a way to transport them here. The tea, sugar, and cloth needed by the people of Xinjiang must be transported in continuously according to the needs of the people of Xinjiang for materials from the interior. Here, I will give one example to cover the rest.

In terms of transportation, before the railway is built, the government must implement cheap car travel to connect Xinjiang with the interior. The faster the railway goes west, the better.

Now that the Sino-Soviet Agreement has been signed, we must try to obtain the Soviet Union's assistance in Xinjiang's construction, and we should not be stingy even if we give the other party great mutual benefits.

### Promoting Internalization of All Ethnic Groups: All Groups Merge into Our Country's Territory

The trip to Xinjiang is like a dream. All I can think of now are the above points. There is one question left, which is the question of how to make all ethnic groups internalized. If the above-mentioned military and administrative aspects can be achieved to some extent, all ethnic groups will only ask for a stable life and a gradual improvement in their economic and cultural lives. If the government can achieve the above points, it can make all ethnic groups internalized. Then, we should start to import movies, dramas, science, education, and modern scientific lifestyles from the interior into Xinjiang one by one, while maintaining and promoting the languages, scripts, and cultures of all ethnic groups. Universities and various public undertakings in the interior (such as railways and highways) should absorb the youth of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to receive education and study. These are all ways to make people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang internalized. If we persist in doing so, we can produce good results. In this way, Xinjiang will be completely integrated into the territory of China, which is just around the corner. (Early February 1946 in Shanghai)

### Utilizing Surplus Milk

Donating to Provide for a Portion of Elementary School Children

To the esteemed editor:

Recently, while chatting with some friends, I heard a surprising piece of news: the Shanghai Milk Shed's daily production of over 30,000 pounds of milk has a surplus portion that cannot find an outlet. Originally, for a city like Shanghai with a population exceeding five million, a supply of just over 30,000 pounds of milk is already quite meager. But to think that even this meager supply has a surplus that cannot find an outlet truly astonished me when I heard it. Some say that the general public's living standards have not yet reached the point where they can afford to drink milk; this economic problem certainly exists. Others say that our people do not have the habit of drinking milk. Still others say that even among those who have the money and can afford to drink milk, many still believe in the advertisements for tonics on the radio and fundamentally do not truly understand the benefits of milk; this is a lack of general nutritional knowledge among the people. All of these situations are important factors contributing to the surplus of milk. The purpose of writing this short article is not to resolve the various reasons for this milk surplus, but rather to seek a suitable and useful outlet for this surplus milk.

Just recently, in an article I read in a certain day's Shen Bao, "An Extremely Important But Neglected Group—The Nutritional Problems of Poor Students," I was deeply moved by this article. Because from my position as a doctor, the talents cultivated with many years of effort and hard work, if their bodies remain weak and frail like the "sick man of East Asia," this is an irreparable loss to the country. And in terms of national health, it is a serious problem that urgently needs to be remedied. At the same time, I recalled an essay by Mr. Chen Hengzhe in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao last year, "Save Our Next Generation of Citizens" (the title was so large because the original text is not at hand), and I was also extremely sympathetic at the time. I believe that anyone who has read this article will also be sympathetic. But what is the use of sympathy! The encouragement of words is only the first step in starting to act practically, and the most important need is that after encouraging words, we must have planned and step-by-step action.

In the past, the movement to raise scholarships in the Shen Xin and Xin Shen newspapers was very much valued by many people, and as a result, a lot of money was raised, allowing poor students to continue their studies. Hasn't there been a movement to raise loan scholarships and scholarships recently? Therefore, it seems that to solve the current practical problem of a milk surplus that cannot find an outlet, we can also imitate the method of raising loan scholarships and scholarships as a way to solve this problem.

The first step in implementing this method is to launch a fundraising campaign to purchase the surplus milk on the market. The owner of the Milk Shed should set a price that is only enough to cover costs. In terms of fundraising methods, a person can regularly commit to purchasing ten pounds or more per day each month, or it doesn't have to be measured in pounds, and donating a sum of money is also acceptable. In short, it is hoped that people who sympathize with this movement will donate funds, no matter how small, in order to purchase as much of this surplus milk, reduced to the lowest cost, as possible.

The second step is to use this surplus milk to provide it free of charge to a portion of elementary school children who need to drink milk. The "portion" refers to children who, after a physical examination, are found to be malnourished or otherwise in need of milk; at the same time, when starting to implement this, it should begin with children from poor families. This method of providing milk free of charge was implemented in the United Kingdom for women, infants, and general children during the recent war. As for regular implementation, it is very common in public health agencies or elementary schools in Europe and the United States. Before the war, there was a method of giving soy milk in Nanjing, China. Free milk has not yet been implemented. Based on these two steps, I have several brief methods:

(1) To utilize this surplus milk and apply it appropriately, local sympathetic and enthusiastic people should launch publicity campaigns, such as using radio, advertisements in movie theaters, and special columns in major newspapers to advocate in writing, etc.

(2) Imitating the method of raising loan scholarships, entrust banks or newspaper offices to collect funds on behalf of the government to provide free milk subsidies to a portion of elementary school children, and a committee should be formed by sympathetic and enthusiastic people to manage the matter.

(3) The local health education committee (an institution formed by local health and education authorities) should send personnel (doctors and nurses) to examine the physical condition of local elementary school children, and use the results of this examination as the sole basis for providing free milk.

(4) Consult with the milk industry association to determine the lowest cost price, and contact them about how to transport this surplus milk from Shanghai (assuming there is still a surplus) to other larger cities, such as Wu County, Wuxi, Wujin, and Zhenjiang along the Shanghai-Nanjing line.

(5) This surplus milk must be regularly inspected by local health authorities (because the harm of unqualified milk is well known to us). At the same time, strict management of milk sheds is very important, because perhaps a very small number of milk sheds are still not up to standard.

In addition, there are naturally some minor technical issues that need to be discussed, which will be left to those who sympathize with and are enthusiastic about this movement to study. I am simply putting forward my thoughts as a suggestion, hoping that Shen Bao will advocate for it, and even more hoping that enlightened people in society will not hesitate to offer their advice.

### When Will You Visit the Moon Palace?

— By Professor Lockeard

I don't know how many people have asked me, "When are you going to visit the Moon Palace?" Before any new invention, such as ships, airplanes, etc., is introduced to the world, people laugh and say, "Impossible." Isn't that so? Fifty years ago, who believed that flight was possible? Even those in positions of authority said that flight had no military importance. Doctors in the mid-19th century were still saying that a speed of sixty miles per hour was fatal to the human heart. Twenty-five years ago, how many people could believe that one day people could sit comfortably in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on an ocean liner, comfortably watch their homes, and talk to their families?

The organizational goals and plans of

The British Interplanetary Society

are truly hard for the world to believe. Fifty years from now, will we still be able to do without the fuels used in today's world? Fuel is indeed our biggest problem. This is not only an Interplanetary Society, but also a Rocket Society, to test the extent to which this rocket theory will affect human life in the future in "normal" space travel.

Germany also has an Interplanetary Society, which has been strongly supported by the government for fifteen years. Its members are leaders in various fields with scientific thinking, such as astrology, aeronautics, chemistry, physics, and radio engineering. The British Interplanetary Society was established in 1933, composed of a small number of scientists, many doctors, adventurers, and mathematicians.

Until the outbreak of the war, the main subject of research for the Interplanetary Society was how to set up a means of transportation that met the conditions for scientific travel to reach the surface of the moon. During the war, the Interplanetary Society was not very active. Now its main task is still to study and analyze the initial results.

The British Rocket Experiment

The result of the British flight to the Isle of Wight rocket was that it exploded before landing, proving that the fuel was unsuitable. Countless experiments have been done for rocket fuel. Liquid gas was only recently allowed for commercial use, or it may give people clues to invent many new types of explosives, which may create a new era in high-speed travel. It is not yet known.

Using rockets is a major modern invention. Although relatively speaking, it is not a large horsepower, it has been as large as several thousand. The problem of storing thousands of tons of fuel is complicated enough. Wouldn't a spacecraft to overcome space need hundreds of millions of tons of fuel? However, preliminary experiments can only use smaller rockets, and they must also carry signals so that people on Earth can see them. Liquid fuel not only simplifies the control of manned rockets, but also increases the speed at which rockets escape the Earth's gravitational range. High speed is necessary because, on the one hand, it overcomes the infinite space, and on the other hand, rockets rely on high-speed temperature to maintain efficiency.

The first person with technical arguments and common sense to

Dream of Space Travel

was the Russian Tsiolkovsky. As early as 1903, he had this idea. In 1914, American Dr. Goddard published his famous work, advocating the use of the highest rockets for technical reconnaissance of space. It can be seen that the concept of space travel had already sprouted, and interplanetary research has since become a more accurate science. German, American, and French scientists have devoted themselves to research work.

Preparing months of food, air, and entertainment on the moon currently seems impossible. It is said that a successful spacecraft should reach a speed of seven miles per second. It is not easy for people to live on the moon. Because the air pressure is too low, tea must be boiled in a sturdy metal container and drunk immediately, otherwise it will cool down immediately. There are no trees on the moon, and the bed is just a piece of plywood. In short, at the beginning of 1946, we still feel that visiting the Moon Palace is just a fantasy. But in the future, there will always be a day when people set off to the Moon Palace and say, "Ah! This must be the best grand tour!" (English translation)

Weekly Forum

### The Economic Value of Atomic Energy

— Zhao Zengjue

In order to promote research on the "atomic energy" issue, which is attracting worldwide attention, this newspaper has specially invited Mr. Zhao Zengjue to write a special essay on the above issue in simple and easy-to-understand language, to be published in installments. The first two articles have already been published in this newspaper on December 9th of last year and January 13th of this year, respectively. This is the third article. Further articles will be published in the weekly forum to stimulate public interest in discussion. (Editor)

I. The Basic Theorem of Atomic Energy Calculation

If the First World War can be said to be a chemical war, then undoubtedly the Second World War can be called a physical war. When we talk about chemistry, we know that the smallest indivisible unit of each simple element is the "atom." There are a total of ninety-two elements in the world. Mendeleev arranged them into a periodic table according to their atomic weight and properties, discovering that these elements have a natural order and regular chemical properties. To describe an atom, in addition to its name, there are two numbers that are very important: one is its relative weight, called "atomic weight," and the other is its position in the periodic table, called "atomic number." With these two numbers, we can identify a specific atom. It's like having "weight" and "age," it's not difficult to determine which older or younger brother it is. Among these ninety-two brothers, the heaviest is the eldest brother, uranium, with an atomic weight of 238 and an atomic number of 92. The lower the atomic number of the other brothers, the lighter the weight. These ninety-two brothers each have their own individual characteristics. In the late nineteenth century, it was proven that an atom is composed of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. The space between the nucleus and the surrounding electrons is filled with space, like planets orbiting the sun to form the solar system. The number of electrons surrounding the nucleus is equal to the "atomic number," so hydrogen has only one electron surrounding it, and uranium has ninety-two. We say that hydrogen's atomic number is one, and uranium's is ninety-two. These electrons surrounding the nucleus supply all chemical reactions, such as the burning of coal and the explosion of gunpowder, which are chemical manifestations.

What is now called atomic energy is actually "atomic nuclear energy," not the superficial electron energy. This "atomic nuclear energy" is extremely powerful, hidden in the nucleus, and is not easily released unless the nucleus is broken. It is a physical manifestation. Our main question is to study what exactly the atomic nucleus is and how it can be broken. In fact, the entire weight of an atom is concentrated within a very small area—the nucleus. The nucleus contains "protons" and "neutrons," which are extremely tightly bound together. Protons carry a positive charge, which cancels out the negative charge of the electrons surrounding the nucleus. Neutrons carry no charge at all and are completely neutral, with a weight similar to that of protons. Because neutrons carry no charge, they are the most difficult to control and are not affected by the electric field of the atomic nucleus. They were discovered last by scientists. If we use them as weapons to attack the atomic nucleus, it's like entering an uninhabited land. They are the main actors in the success of the atomic bomb! However, neutrons cannot be supplied naturally and can only be obtained by breaking down the atomic nucleus, which adds to our difficulty. But since the emergence of neutrons, a new concept of the atomic nucleus has been established. Take uranium, for example: the nucleus of uranium contains ninety-two protons and one hundred and forty-six neutrons, weighing two hundred and thirty-eight and carrying a charge of ninety-two.

The study of neutrons has attracted the attention of countless scientists. Physicists have discovered that neutrons with lower speeds are more useful than neutrons with higher speeds, because neutrons with high speeds quickly pass through matter and may not have any effect. However, neutrons with low speeds linger in between and often cause the transmutation of matter. The reason for this is easy to understand. For example, a bullet with a very high speed passes through the flesh of the human body, but it is not as effective as a bullet with a low speed that spins around in the flesh. Using low-speed neutrons to bombard the atomic nucleus will cause fission, which is another main cause of the atomic bomb. The use of atomic energy is to break the atomic nucleus by physical methods, so that the "energy" hidden within can be used by us. When breaking the atomic nucleus of a certain substance, it is necessary to choose the substance to be bombarded and new methods and weapons. In other words, the best weapon for breaking the atomic nucleus is a "neutron" with a lower speed, and the best substance to be bombarded is an unstable element. Uranium family elements are famously unstable elements and have long been regarded by scientists as something that can be utilized.

But according to the two laws of conservation of matter and conservation of energy, how can we create a large amount of "energy" out of thin air? As early as 1905, Einstein, as a result of his research on the theory of relativity, proved mathematically that matter and energy can be transformed into each other. The confirmation of this kind of transformation can be seen in radioactive substances, and it proves that radioactive energy is equal to the product of the mass unit multiplied by the square of the speed of light. If one kilogram of matter is completely converted into energy, it can produce 25 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, or 2150 trillion calories of heat. This astonishing number shows that matter is indeed a source of "energy." The question of matter transforming into energy was not previously noticed by people, but in the recent fifteen years, it has gradually been observed, tested, and confirmed by scientists with precision instruments. One is due to the invention of sophisticated instruments, and the other is due to the progress of atomic physics. Originally, the ninety-two elements in nature, including two hundred and fifty isotopes, are stable and not easy to open the nucleus. Therefore, we must search for or create new elements whose nuclei are easier to open, and then we can obtain atomic energy. In summary, atomic energy is not easy to obtain, requires strong technology, and costs huge amounts of money. Its economic value must be carefully studied.

II. The Value of Atomic Energy in Wartime

When studying radioactive materials, we have to study the uranium family, because its production is relatively abundant, about one million times that of radium. Uranium has isotopes such as U-238, U-235, and U-234. In ordinary natural uranium, U-238 accounts for 99.7%, U-235 accounts for about 0.3%, and U-234 is extremely rare. Among these three uranium family isotopes, the first can be called ordinary uranium. Its production is one hundred times more than the second. The second can be called uranium-235, which is relatively unstable, and its nucleus is relatively easy to break, which is the source of the explosion. Its chance of explosion is one hundred and eighty times more than ordinary uranium, so it is suitable for making atomic bombs. In February 1940, Professor Niel of the University of Minnesota used a mass spectrometer to separate U-238 and U-235 by using their different weights. Alternatively, the gaseous method can also be used to separate U-235 from U-238. Finally, pure uranium-235 was successfully extracted. The bomb made with this kind of uranium-235 may be the one dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, which is more expensive!

But scientists also want to study new materials that are cheaper and have more opportunities, so plutonium has also become a large-scale product through experiments. I mentioned earlier that physicists use neutrons to bombard uranium, hoping to discover atoms other than uranium. As a result, there were indeed two elements. The first is that ordinary uranium absorbs external neutrons and becomes a new element with an atomic number of 93, which is neptunium. Its nucleus contains ninety-two protons and one hundred and forty-seven neutrons, but it is too unstable and can be said to be an intermediate between ordinary uranium and plutonium. Soon, it emits two electrons, and the nucleus becomes ninety-four protons and one hundred and forty-five neutrons, and becomes plutonium. This element number 94—plutonium Pu239—can be separated from uranium-238 by chemical methods and processed separately, because its chemical properties are different from ordinary uranium. This element encounters external neutrons and undergoes fission, which can explode and produce a chain reaction—it is the big firework of the universe! When the new element—plutonium—is manufactured, because more abundant ordinary uranium can be used, the opportunity is one hundred and forty times more than the method of refining uranium-235 mentioned in the previous paragraph, and it can be separated by chemical methods, so it is more economical. The atomic bomb made with this new element is a little cheaper, maybe it is the bomb dropped on Nagasaki!

Up to now, the main materials that the United States has gathered countless scientists to study and can use atomic energy since 1940 can be summarized, and only the above two have been officially announced. One is uranium-235, and the other is plutonium-239. In the United States, with abundant resources and a large number of talents, the process was accelerated, lasting for five years and costing 2 to 3 billion US dollars. If it were not in wartime, and for the sake of winning the final victory, it would never have been so successful so quickly. And the most interesting thing is that, as far as we know, only three atomic bombs were actually used. The first was tested for the first time in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, the second was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, and the third was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 10. Afterwards, on August 12, Japan unconditionally announced its surrender. Whether the United States has continued to manufacture atomic bombs since then is currently unknown, but in any case, it was these three atomic bombs that really helped us end this world war. Assuming that all the research and manufacturing costs are spread over these three atomic bombs, each one costs about 1 billion US dollars, and it ended this unprecedented massacre. Then the value of each 1 billion US dollar atomic bomb far exceeds the monetary cost! In any case, it is worth our spending. So, the value of atomic energy in wartime is undoubtedly.

III. The Economic Value of Atomic Energy in Peacetime

Next, we want to examine the economic value of atomic energy in peacetime. Before examining, we must consider the following points when using atomic energy: (1) the dangerousness of atomic energy radioactivity; (2) the weight and value of isolation radiation equipment; (3) the danger of possible explosions; (4) the possible lack of atomic energy raw material—uranium—which cannot continue to be supplied; (5) the government's strict control of atomic energy resources. If all of these can be resolved, we can use uranium-235 in two different ways: one is to use ordinary refined uranium-235, which requires a larger uranium pile, and the other is to use uranium-235 with a higher degree of refinement, which requires a more economical uranium pile, to generate the required heat energy for industrial applications. The so-called degree of refinement refers to the level of the uranium-235 content in the raw material. Usually, the reasonable uranium-235 content in industry can range from 1% to 15%. Now we might as well assume that using uranium-235 with a content of 10% is the standard raw material for industrial applications of atomic energy. When atomic energy is used, the first step is the utilization of heat. This heat generated by atomic energy can be transferred to water, air, or other fluids to drive internal combustion turbines or steam turbines to rotate generators or aircraft. In the future, using atomic energy as the power of missiles is the simplest range of application in the ideal.

Furthermore, in order to obtain the economic ratio of atomic energy in peacetime, the best way is to make a simple comparison between the "energy" that each pound of atomic energy raw material can produce and the price of coal or gasoline that produces the same amount of energy. We buy coal and gasoline not for coal or gasoline, but for "energy." We refine uranium-235 or plutonium not for uranium-235 or plutonium, but for "energy." Therefore, it is most appropriate and convenient to compare the price of coal or gasoline that produces the same amount of "energy" with the price of the standard uranium-235 that produces the same amount of energy. According to physicists' estimates, the heat energy generated by one pound of uranium-235 is equivalent to 11.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is equivalent to the electricity generated by the Shanghai Electric Power Company in one month in November of the 34th year. Assuming that an average of two pounds of coal generates one kilowatt-hour of electricity, then it is equivalent to 10,000 tons of coal. Now the official price of coal in Shanghai is about 15 US dollars per ton, then one pound of pure uranium-235, in order to compete with coal that produces the same amount of electricity, its cost cannot exceed 150,000 US dollars. If the refinement of uranium-235 is 10%, then each pound of this kind of uranium-235 should not exceed 15,000 US dollars, because it is easier to refine raw materials containing 10% uranium-235. This is of course the most rough estimate, but it can be seen that in order for the application of atomic energy in industry to have economic value, its cost should not exceed the above figures. If according to the cost of the atomic bomb, it is not easy to reach this figure! In order to require the cheapness of the cost, we must rely on the joint efforts of scientists and engineers, and then there is a possibility of practical use in industry. We hope that their hard work will be realized in the near future. (The End)

### The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Establishes the Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation; Offices Commence Operations in Shanghai, Qingdao, Hankou, and Kowloon

Since November of last year, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has begun preparing to establish the Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation in the six ports where relief and rehabilitation materials are imported: Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Kowloon, and Hankou. The organizational regulations were approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 29th of last month. The bureau is divided into warehousing, transportation, accounting, general affairs, and personnel groups. Except for Dalian, where the port has not yet been opened and is awaiting organization, the bureaus in Shanghai, Qingdao, Hankou, and Kowloon have been quickly established. The Tianjin bureau is still in preparation. In addition to the Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation, the Administration has also organized a storage and transportation office in Guangzhou, which is currently in preparation, and storage and transportation stations in Kunming and Guiyang, which have also been established.

Personnel of Each Bureau

The heads of each bureau, office, and station have been appointed. (1) Director of the Shanghai Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation: Sun Jialu; Deputy Director: Huang Mindao. (2) Director of the Kowloon Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation: Zeng Guangzhi. (3) Director of the Tianjin Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation: Niu Zequan. (4) Director of the Qingdao Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation: Wu Yinglun; Deputy Director: Ke Chengchun. (5) Director of the Dalian Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation: Chen Defen. (6) Director of the Hankou Bureau of Materials Storage and Transportation: Cai Kexuan; Deputy Director: Zhang Fuyin. (7) Director of the Guangzhou Storage and Transportation Office: Ma Kaiyan.

UNRRA Relocation

The number of staff transferred from Chongqing to Shanghai by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is increasing daily, and the office space is insufficient. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), which shares office space with the Administration, has also decided to move to the Riverside Mansion in the middle of this month. After that, the entire former site of the Japanese Mitsui Corporation will be used by the Administration. Except for Deputy Director Xue Feng, who is in Chongqing presiding over the Administration's affairs and preparing to lead the remaining staff in Chongqing to return to the capital, almost all of the key staff of the Administration have come to Shanghai from Chongqing. Among those who recently arrived in Shanghai is Director Hu Keshi of the General Affairs Department. Before Director Hu arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai General Affairs of the Administration was concurrently handled by Committee Member Nie Guangdi. It is now said that Mr. Nie has resigned from his concurrent position, and Director Hu is fully responsible for everything.

Shanghai Branch Promotes Relief and Assistance

The Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is actively promoting relief and assistance work. From November 19th of last year to the end of January of this year, a total of 130 units applied to the Branch for food and clothing, including Jewish refugees throughout the city, as well as Central European expatriates, Italian sailors, Italian expatriates, White Russians, and refugee shelters of various charitable organizations. A total of 96,526 bags of flour, 7,984 boxes of Grade C rations, 50 boxes of canned beef, 1,230 pounds of biscuits, 103 boxes of dried beans, 4,390 pounds of milk powder, 3,332 cans of milk, 1,080 bundles of old clothes, and 782 bundles of old shoes have been distributed.

Work-Relief Project to Repair River Embankments

The Yangtze River embankment between Wuwei County and Hexian County in Anhui Province has been in disrepair for many years, and its collapse has caused great suffering to neighboring counties. The Anhui Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has decided to start repairing the embankment on the 20th of this month. The total length is over 240 Chinese miles. The Branch will implement a work-relief program, hiring 40,000 workers daily to rush the repair. One Chinese pound of flour will be issued for each cubic foot of repair. It is estimated that a total of 2.4 million workdays will be required. If the weather remains clear for 60 consecutive days, the entire repair project can be completed. According to a spokesman for the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the repair of the Wuhe section will benefit over 20,000 square kilometers of land and over 4 million people. The most dangerous project is the Huangsitan section, which affects seven counties: Sicheng, Lujiang, Wuwei, Chaoxian, Hefei, Hexian, and Hanshan.

Head of Hunan Branch Comes to Shanghai to Report

Yu Jichuan, the Director of the Hunan Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Hawkins, the UNRRA representative stationed in Hunan, came to Shanghai yesterday together to visit Director Chiang, to report on their work, and to discuss issues such as the quantity and transportation of relief materials. They also discussed the construction work on the Yuehan Railway.

### French Consul General Ferey Hosts Banquet for Mayor Qian and Others

French Consul General in Shanghai, Ferey, hosted a banquet at the French Consulate last night at 7 PM to entertain Mayor Qian, as well as Shen Shihua, Li Jilan, Chen Guolian, Feng Youzhen, and Li Haoling. French diplomatic and military representatives in Shanghai accompanied them. During the banquet, the French Consul General and Mayor Qian exchanged toasts, congratulating the prosperity of China and France and the friendship between the two countries, which was quite harmonious.

### Vice President of American Red Cross Nicholson Arrives in Shanghai

Nicholson, Vice President of the American Red Cross, departed from Washington and arrived in Shanghai on the night of the 8th. Mr. Nicholson's mission on this trip is to inspect the situation in the Pacific and the Far East in order to determine the Red Cross's work plan for the future. Mr. Nicholson met with senior officers of the US Army and Navy and visited General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces, yesterday morning.

### Youth Army Leaves Shanghai Today; Liao Yaoxiang Will Fly to Jinzhou Immediately

[Our Newspaper] After the victory of the War of Resistance, the New Sixth Army was ordered to garrison the capital and was later transferred to Shanghai. As the takeover work in the Northeast is imminent, the army began to depart Shanghai by sea at the beginning of last month, and its advance unit, the 14th Division, has already arrived in Xinmin. The Youth Army's 207th Division, which is assigned to the army, is also scheduled to depart today. Army Commander Liao Yaoxiang and 207th Division Commander Luo Youlun are said to be taking a special plane to Jinzhou tomorrow to meet with Director Du Yuming and then go to the command post to command their troops.

The 621st Regiment of the Youth Expeditionary Force's 207th Division, which was the rearguard, was delayed along the way due to the shallow water in the Yangtze River and did not arrive in Shanghai until yesterday afternoon, led by Regiment Commander Peng Kefu, a major general. This morning, the entire regiment changed into winter uniforms and landed ashore. It is said that after a brief rest in Shanghai, it will continue to be shipped by sea to the Northeast to take on the important task of defending the front line of national defense.

### Valuable Objects Fall From the Sky

[Our Newspaper] At around 3:00 PM on January 31st, an aircraft flying from west Shanghai flew low over Gujia Stone Bridge, about three Chinese miles north of Xinzhuang Town in west Shanghai. Suddenly, an iron box fell from the plane into the bamboo garden behind the house of a farmer, Chen A'ning. Chen took it home and opened it for inspection. It is said that there were many valuable objects and clothes inside. Because the villagers did not distribute them evenly, they fought over them. They are now temporarily kept at Chen A'ning's home, awaiting authorities to come and claim them.

### Luo Jialun Arrives in Shanghai

Mr. Luo Jialun arrived in Shanghai by plane from the United States yesterday after his official trip to the United States.

They are currently temporarily housed in the Jiangwan Reception Center of the Shanghai Relief and Rescue Sub-Bureau and will be sent back to their original hometowns within the next few days.

### Navy Trainees to Come to Shanghai from Qingdao

The first group of trainees from the Central Navy Training Corps, who have been undergoing training in Qingdao, have decided to sail three US landing craft to Shanghai today for maritime training. They are expected to arrive here around the 13th. There are a total of ninety trainees and over ten officers on the three craft. An equivalent number of American officers and soldiers are also on board as instructors.

### Applications for Passports to Go Abroad Should Be Handled According to Procedures

[Our Newspaper] The procedures for applying for passports to go abroad began on the 1st of this month, and the number of applicants to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been very enthusiastic in recent days. However, only a few have been approved and issued, because most of them are not familiar with the procedures. According to regulations, applications must be submitted by the competent authorities before passports can be reviewed and issued.

### American Liner President Pierce Returns to the US with Cargo

The American President Lines' President Pierce sailed from Shanghai via Hong Kong back to the US today for the first time, stopping at Los Angeles and San Francisco on the way to New York. This time, it is carrying over one thousand tons of goods for Hong Kong, fifty bales of Huzhou silk, over ten tons of pig bristles, and over twenty tons of fur for the US.

### Sheng Zhenwei Discusses Key Amendments to the New Company Law – Related to Regulations for Foreign Companies

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the revision and implementation of the Company Law, this reporter paid a special visit to Legislative Yuan member and drafting committee member of the new Company Law, Mr. Sheng Zhenwei. He stated that in addition to himself, Legislative Yuan members Zhang Zhaoyuan and Sun Jiulu were also on the drafting committee. The new Company Law has a total of 361 articles and was originally scheduled to be implemented on January 1st of this year. However, due to some

minor opinions

from British and American business circles, the matter was submitted by the Supreme National Defense Council to the Legislative Yuan for further review and revision. Mr. Sheng has been in Shanghai for over a month and is not fully aware of the details of the revisions. However, he believes that the revisions are largely related to the regulations for foreign companies. It is reported that Article 7 of the new Company Law stipulates: "The term 'foreign company' as used in this law refers to a company that is organized and registered for profit-making purposes in accordance with foreign law or chartered by a foreign government, and which has been recognized by the Chinese government and operates within the territory of China." The original intention of the legislation was based on the fact that in the past,

foreign companies

established in our country often had no business to speak of in their home countries. The establishment of these foreign companies in our country was based on the China Trade Act in the United States, and the commercial regulations promulgated by the Hong Kong government in the UK. All regulations were more convenient and simpler than the company laws of their home countries. Therefore, they often simply hung up a foreign company license in our country or claimed to be registered abroad and then called themselves a foreign company. Now the new Company Law stipulates that one of the conditions for a foreign company in China is that it must have business operations in its home country. It is now said that the revised Company Law may remove the word "business operations." Other matters, such as foreign companies being able to

purchase real estate

in our country, are also said to be revised, but it is claimed that this regulation is of a reciprocal nature. It was once said that the re-revised Company Law would be implemented on March 1st of this year, but now it is said that it may be delayed again because the government is urgently preparing to move the capital.

### The Authorities Discuss Ways to Deal with the Poor Water Quality of the Suzhou Creek

The Municipal Public Works Bureau convened a joint meeting at the Municipal Government Building yesterday morning with leading personnel from the Health Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Waterworks to discuss issues such as the disposal of sewage and ditches. According to the report of the engineer from the Ditch and Canal Engineering Department of the Bureau, the water quality of the Suzhou Creek and the Shajing River is extremely poor based on water sample tests, to the extent that fish cannot survive. This is due to the accumulation of garbage dumped on both banks over the years. The poor water quality affects the city's drinking water and harms the health of the citizens. The Health Bureau is now seeking ways to prevent garbage from being dumped. Other matters concerning the inspection of well water in the city and the dredging of rivers are being actively promoted by relevant agencies, and it is also planned to request assistance from the Dredging Bureau and the Naval Authorities.

### Litan Nathan Re-Examined - Zou Xiangzhi Denies Wrongdoing

[Our Newspaper] Litan Nathan, the Lithuanian owner of the former DiDi's Café on Jing'an Temple Road, was accused of serving as an informant for the Japanese Kenpeitai (military police) during the period of enemy occupation, selling firearms for them, and detaining the Cuban Luo Shengbang. He had previously been questioned once. The defendant firmly denied the charges, claiming that his business operations over the years had nothing to do with the Japanese, and that he himself had been detained twice by the Japanese Kenpeitai. The case was re-examined yesterday by Liu Yugui, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court. The victim, Luo Shengbang, testified in court: He knew Litan Nathan and was arrested by the Japanese Kenpeitai in 1940, accused of being a Soviet spy. After suffering various tortures, he was sentenced to four years in prison and imprisoned in Shanghai Prison until he was released last year. Because Nathan was involved with the Japanese Kenpeitai, he suspected that it was Nathan who reported him. He then presented a certificate proving Nathan's service in the Kenpeitai and claimed that he could produce witnesses to prove it next time. After questioning the witness produced by the defendant, the Russian Stasichigo, the court ordered a hearing for debate on the morning of the 14th.

Zou Xiangzhi, from Nanjing, once served as a detective for the Shanghai West Special Police Bureau, a disciple of the notorious Wu Shibao. He also served as a detective in the Special Higher Section of the Tongfu Road Police Station, where he committed many evil deeds. After the victory, he was reported, arrested, and transferred to the court. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu opened the court for questioning. The defendant stated: He was engaged in the electric light and wireless radio business. At that time, because the roads were sometimes blocked, he nominally served as a detective in the bureau for the sake of convenient work, but he did not commit any evil deeds. He also hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to defend him. The court adjourned for another hearing at a later date.

### Significant Progress in Public Health in Our Country – Lieutenant Cook Discusses Inspection Visit

[Our Newspaper] Lieutenant Cook, a medical officer of the US Navy's Seventh Fleet, recently returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, he hosted Chinese and foreign reporters on the fifth floor of the Cathay Hotel to report on his visit to various facilities of the Ministry of Health of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing on the 4th of this month. He highly praised China's public health.

Perfect Equipment at the Chongqing Ministry of Health

Lieutenant Cook said that today's China has the best public health organization in the world, and there are also many well-trained doctors. The Ministry of Health in Chongqing is fully equipped, and its achievements in bacterial testing and food and drug inspection are excellent. It also produces its own DDT solution and soy milk powder, the nourishing ingredients of which are no less than those of cow's milk. In addition, it conducted a survey on lung diseases and found that 50% of students in Chongqing are suspected of having lung diseases.

Health Education Should Be Actively Promoted

Lieutenant Cook particularly praised the Ministry of Health's promotion of public health education. He said that the most important point in implementing public health is to educate the people, instill medical knowledge, and make them aware of the importance of hygiene so that they can protect their health. This is an especially important responsibility for those engaged in news reporting. The Chinese people are often influenced by various superstitions, such as religion, and neglect proper treatment. Lieutenant Cook believes that future doctors and nurses in China should be trained within the country. Hiring foreign medical leaders can only be responsible for guidance and advice and should not engage in practical work.

### Actively Prevent Infectious Diseases

– Ping Xiao

As winter ends and spring arrives, it is again the time when infectious diseases start. The Health Bureau has already taken various preventive steps.

Chen Bangxian, Director of the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Health Bureau, said: "Diphtheria, smallpox, and meningitis have been discovered in this city. The number of patients was highest a month ago, but it has now been greatly reduced. The reasons for the occurrence of infectious diseases this winter are: First, the weather was abnormal last winter, as warm as spring; second, the situation of infectious diseases in other ports such as Hankou was quite serious, and some travelers inevitably brought some germs to Shanghai. But the most active time for infectious diseases is always spring. After this great war, citizens should really prevent them as early as possible."

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has helped the Health Bureau a lot. Their medical experts often hold meetings with the Bureau to formulate practical plans for the Bureau to adopt. UNRRA also provided some vaccines and penicillin, and recently prepared to send a large car, specially prepared for the Health Bureau to rush to disinfect after an epidemic has occurred. The Health Bureau is working hard to improve efficiency, so they are trying to reduce the "circular of official documents" and strive for agility. If the infected patients are in poor condition, then all medical and other expenses will be waived. The current trend of epidemics is not yet serious. If it slowly becomes rampant, the Health Bureau plans to cooperate with the baojia (community security system) to implement compulsory vaccination.

Because of epidemic prevention, we talked about tap water. Director Chen said: Now the water company still regularly sends water samples for inspection, and the results are quite satisfactory. However, sometimes the water source of the company is very clean, but when it is distributed to people, it becomes dirty because the water pipes have been in disrepair for a long time. This kind of inspection is very difficult. Moreover, most epidemics occur in poor areas, and in these places, residents only drink well water because tap water is too expensive. Now the Health Bureau has begun to inspect those wells, and if they are considered unsanitary, they will immediately close the wells. The Health Bureau is currently trying to reduce the price of tap water to a very low level so that everyone can afford it.

Shanghai's garbage is also a problem for the Health Bureau. Not counting Pudong, the city center, and other places, Shanghai has 1,900 tons of garbage every day. Now the Health Bureau has 29 garbage trucks and 1,500 handcarts (only 800 of which are intact), which is really not enough. According to Director Chen's estimate, we need at least 100 garbage trucks to clear all this garbage every day.

### Mediation of Power Company Labor Dispute Reaches Good Stage - Cantonese Cuisine Labor Dispute Still Deadlocked

In the Shanghai Tram Company labor dispute, the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives of the workers on the 7th to state their opinions and invited representatives of the employers on the 8th to state their opinions. The opinions of both parties were quite close.

Preliminary Review Is Very Solemn

Yesterday afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau consulted on handling methods and reviewed the company's various articles of association and forms. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan, and the Public Utilities Bureau sent representative Li Kaidi, to conduct a preliminary review. Director Wu Kaixian personally reviewed the review, which was very solemn. He also consulted with Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau on handling methods, and made thorough discussions on each of the conditions proposed by the employees and the recent opinions of both parties. According to Section Chief Zhang's interview with reporters, the negotiation of the labor dispute has reached a good stage. It is expected that a meeting of labor and management will be convened tomorrow, and a satisfactory result is expected.

Employer Representatives Refuse to Attend

The Cantonese cuisine labor dispute is still deadlocked and has not been resolved. The Social Affairs Bureau scheduled a meeting of labor and management at 2:00 PM yesterday to continue the negotiations at the Social Affairs Bureau. The labor representatives Zhu Gang, Zhang Ronghua representing the "Shanbang" (mountain gang) of the restaurant industry, Shen Jinsong representing the "Benbang" (local gang), Zhang Zhenyun representing the "Xibang" (Tin gang), He Yicheng representing the "Subang" (Suzhou gang), Sun Shunian representing the "Chuanyangbang" (Sichuan and Yangzhou gang), and Zhu Shifa representing the Western Cuisine group, all arrived at the Social Affairs Bureau on time. The employer representatives did not arrive. According to reporter inquiries, a certain representative of the employers sent a letter to Section Chief Zhang, stating that the conditions proposed by the workers were too high and the employers could not accept them. Before the labor-management negotiations were close, please slow down the mediation, so they did not intend to participate in the mediation meeting. This action is in fact an expression of the employers' refusal to mediate. In order to take into account the convenience of the public's diet and the stability of the society, the Social Affairs Bureau will submit a mediation decision on the 11th, ordering labor and management to comply.

### Speculators Stir Up Trouble - "Fried Yellow" Soars - Silver Shops' Absorption Power Is Also Not Small

Yesterday, "fried yellow" (gold speculation) was like a galloping horse, with almost all obstacles removed. People generally have an unbelievably high view of US exchange rates and gold. Speculators did whatever they wanted. Floating funds moved from stocks to gold. In the afternoon, the over-the-counter price was shouted up to 1.42 million. It was found that the opening price in the morning immediately rose to 1.305 million, following the momentum of the previous day. After opening, it hovered around the 1.30 million mark. Large players wanted to lure and then capture, first advancing and then retreating. In a flash, it pulled up to 1.35 million. Sichuan banks still had supply for sale at high prices, and after the price increase, it gradually stabilized. Northern banks also came to spit out overnight floating profits. It once fell back to 1.29 million. With the absorption of silver shops, it was pulled up again. The afternoon close was 1.34 million, a sharp increase of 94,000 compared to the previous close. In the afternoon, the shouted price gradually increased, the supply was limited, and the buying trend was rekindled. Floating funds gathered in gold and banknotes from all directions. Under the circumstances of something actually happening, rumors sang even higher. Next-day delivery (next Monday) traded as high as around 1.42 million, then retreated to 1.38 million, and finally closed around 1.40 million. Gold jewelry was listed at 148,000, silver at 1,300, and silver dollars rose to over 800 yuan. The dark exchange rate ranged from 1.2 cents to 1.4 cents.

US Dollars Gradually Rising

People generally believe that the listed price of US dollars at 2,000 to 1 is too low, and speculation is expected to rise further. As a result, buyers are extremely eager. At the same time, gold jumped sharply. Those who did not get gold rushed to buy dollars. Arbitragers came in droves, at a difference of 730 yuan per ten taels. The supply of US dollar chips, which had been loosening in the coming days, suddenly became tight. The opening price was 1,780 yuan, and it rose from 1,760 yuan to 1,840 yuan in the middle, and then hovered around 1,800 yuan. The afternoon close was 1,830 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose with the gold market and was shouted up to 1,930 yuan before slightly falling back. As a result, it jumped 130 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar environment helped buyers. Those who profited from gold stocks sought second best, resulting in a wide range of buyers for both new and old dollars. As a result, in the chaotic situation, old dollars rose 50 yuan, and new dollars rose 20 yuan.

### Large Players Emerge, Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Fall Together

Chinese stocks were extremely charming in the middle of yesterday, with large players raising prices to facilitate their exit. After many twists and turns, they finally fell from a high level. At noon, after being tired, they recovered slightly. Wingshare retreated from 2,900 yuan to 2,600 yuan. Mayor from 2,300 yuan to below 2,000 yuan, Jingfu retreated from 148 yuan to below 135 yuan. Afterwards, they were all slightly pulled up, but the unpopular stocks did not have time to recover after falling due to time constraints. As a result, the yarn factory fell slightly compared to the previous close, Mayor was flat, and the three small hot stocks were about 3 yuan higher. The rise and fall of unpopular stocks were mixed.

Foreign stocks also coexisted and prospered with Chinese stocks, first rising and then falling. In the end, the market price gradually reached saturation. Those who profited stopped with satisfaction, and the rising trend seemed to wait for an opportunity to come again. Eves retreated from 6,800 yuan to 6,100 yuan, and the afternoon close was 6,500 yuan, down 100 yuan compared to the previous close. British Union retreated from 9,000 yuan to 8,400 yuan, and the afternoon close was 8,850 yuan, up 100 yuan.

Wheelock retreated from 16,000 yuan to 14,000 yuan, and the afternoon close was 14,500 yuan, a squeeze down of 1,500 yuan.

### Bond Market Sees High Prices But Ultimately Declines

Although government bonds saw high prices again yesterday, major players in the industry, observing activity in the gold market, rushed to convert their bonds into gold, leading to a temporary peak of 2,410 yuan for Type C bonds. This proved fleeting as major players aggressively sold after entering the market, causing the midday price to fall below 2,200 yuan. Consequently, compared to the previous close, Types A, B, and C each fell by 10 yuan, Type D by 18 yuan, and Type E by 50 yuan.

### Fierce Competition for Yarn Drives Prices Higher

Yesterday, the yarn market experienced an increasingly strong surge in prices, with buying interest remaining high. Weaving factories were particularly eager to purchase. 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose by another 80,000 yuan, and other counts generally increased by around 10%. 42-count Blue Phoenix doubled yarn started at 1,400,000 yuan and had already surged to 1,510,000 yuan by the close, an increase of 160,000 to 170,000 yuan from the previous day. Although the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company offered some supply, it lacked both 20-count and 42-count brands, making the spot goods on the market particularly scarce and desirable.

### Current Cotton Mill Demand Still High

The spot cotton market situation continued to firm yesterday, with transactions remaining strong. The demand from the China Textile Company was particularly strong. High-quality Zhongji fine lint sent to the factory reached as high as 100,000 yuan, and San Yu Zhen also reached 88,000 yuan. Fire-engine flower stack transactions were made at 58,000 to 60,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan from before.

### American Cloth Arrives in Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Among the numerous materials shipped to China under the American Lend-Lease Act, cloth accounted for a significant portion. This has now been shipped and unloaded at the Qichang Warehouse, totaling more than 3,000 pieces. The items such as boxed colored goods and hot air are currently being processed. Another report states that stored printed materials, including cloth, will be transferred to Shanghai within days, and the quantity is said to be considerable.

### Rice Market Chaotic, All Food Prices Rise

Yesterday, the price of rice and grain rose sharply, and in a chaotic and inconsistent manner, without formal market prices. White rice, White Goat Xian rice, and White Yuan rice all increased by about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans also rose by 1,000 yuan, flour by 300 to 400 yuan, soybean cakes soared by 500 to 600 yuan, wheat bran rose by 200 to 300 yuan, and the oil market saw another surge of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Only raw peanuts remained stable. At the opening of the market, various goods were still acceptable, but the midday market saw the most intense peak. At closing, there was a slight pullback.

### Tea Market Suddenly Opens Up, Red Board Makes a Stunning Debut

After being suppressed for several days, the tea leaf red board suddenly saw a bright market situation yesterday. Prices generally increased by 20% to 30% compared to last year. The people's sentiment, after being stirred up by the recent financial fluctuations, became more acute, and the asking prices were endless. Actual sales increased frequently, so buyers were willing to absorb at good prices.

### Golden Vegetables and Dried Longans Both Rise

Due to the unstable source of golden vegetables and relatively active sales, the market price tightened repeatedly. Currently, ordinary goods have reached 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, and high-quality goods are even more expensive, an increase of about 20% compared to the previous market.

More than 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous road dried longans have been released daily. Because merchants all have a need for inventory, the market is tightening. The price has risen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan continuously for two days. Xinghua round longans are also increasing in price. It is reported that 3,000+ pieces of Quanzhou round longans arrived yesterday, and it is not easy to see the asking price ease for a while.

### Foreign Paper Continues to Rise

Yesterday, foreign paper continued to rise under the influence of gold prices. A recent investigation revealed that some overseas orders have indeed been shipped, but these are not new orders placed after the war, but rather goods loaded before December 8th that were in transit in the Pacific. It is reported that American manufacturers are mostly hesitant to accept orders easily because the exchange rate with China has not been determined. Therefore, the issue of orders that has been discussed in the city for several months is extremely minor, and the high price of goods may also be due to this. However, transactions are still scarce.

### Market Enthusiasm is Manic, Silk Fabrics All Reach New Prices

The surge in silk prices has not subsided. Yesterday, the spot price of 120-count Sky Bridge artificial silk rose sharply at the market opening. The initial asking price was 1,750,000 yuan, then 1,800,000 yuan. Spot goods were extremely scarce, with no transactions. In the afternoon, the asking price rose even higher to 2,000,000 yuan, which can be described as endless. The highest stack sheet bid was 1,250,001 yuan, and transactions occurred at 1,220,000-1,230,000 yuan. Later, it pulled back slightly to 1,190,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brand 120-count Xuhui sold one piece at 1,750,000 yuan. Raw silk foreign firms and factories had prosperous sales, especially high uniformity, and the price also soared. More than 40 pieces were transacted. Silk fabrics all reached new high prices. Meiya blanket fabric rose by more than 10%. Dacheng Gebi crepe was nearly 20% higher than yesterday. Linji wax feather yarn and Hua Jin crepe both rose by more than 10%.

### Lumber Market Situation Firm

The lumber market situation was quite firm yesterday. Liuan and Liuan plywood were sought after, and new high prices were created. It is also reported that, because the Pinghan Railway needs railway sleepers, Hunan Province has telegraphed the lumber associations in various areas of Hunan, ordering them to purchase railway sleepers by the end of February. Currently, a large amount of lumber has accumulated in Hongjiang, it is said.

### Fuel Committee Sets Measures to Encourage Purchase of Foreign Coal

The Shanghai Fuel Committee, in order to encourage merchants and residents to transport foreign coal to suppress rising coal prices, has formulated four measures for importing foreign coal, which have been approved by President Song. The measures are as follows:

(1) Merchants and residents are allowed to freely transport foreign coal, except for Annam coal.

(2) When necessary, merchants and residents who transport foreign coal may request the Committee to issue a certificate, so as to request an export license from foreign countries. When the ship is allowed to import, the Committee will provide a certificate to the Customs to complete customs clearance.

(3) The Committee may purchase 25% of the imported coal, and the price will be based on cost plus a 10% profit.

(4) These measures only apply to the Shanghai area. It is also reported that, in order to reduce coal prices, President Song has ordered the Ministry of Finance to temporarily levy an import tax of 20% on all foreign imported coal according to the official price of the Fuel Committee.

### Commercial Summary

Dyeing and weaving factories are searching for 12-pound white unbleached fine cloth to prepare for dyeing blue cloth and Indanthrene Blue, but the market inventory is very weak.

Melon seeds, red dates, and black dates are all in short supply, and shipments are scarce. Transit trade along the Hangzhou-Jiaxing line and Hong Kong is still active, and prices are tightening.

Amidst the rising prices of everything else, saccharin and quinine have reached new high prices as a result of the price increases in Western medicine. Caustic soda rose sharply again, and manufacturers' demand remains strong. Those who have goods are refusing to sell, and prices are seen to be rising rapidly.

Due to the rising gold prices in recent days, which has stirred up public sentiment, holders of various cotton textile goods are unwilling to sell. The local sales channels in this city are still strong, and there is some interest in purchasing. The price of 32-count socks is rising the most strongly. The price of 3901 Goose Brand undershirts has fallen compared to yesterday due to retail sellers releasing their inventory.

With red gold rising daily, all kinds of daily necessities are also rising. Retail buyers are adding to their purchases, but sellers are very reluctant to sell. Soap, matches, and foreign candles have all reached new high prices. Sales of British-American Tobacco Company cigarettes are relatively smooth, and prices are firm. Among Chinese-made cigarettes, except for the slight increase in Dagaole and Baiwanjin, the rest are stable.

Cosmetics factories rarely sell, and merchants in the industry generally consider holding goods to be the best strategy, so prices are rising.

[Report from This City] Jin Rizhang, the principal of the private Zijiang Elementary School in this city, did not renew the contracts of five teachers, including Luo Shuxiu, at the end of last semester, which has caused a great uproar. The Elementary School Teachers Occupational Security Promotion Association and others have risen up to support them. After a group of more than a thousand people petitioned the Municipal Education Bureau the day before yesterday, Gu Yuxiu, the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, invited representatives from both sides and relevant organizations to hold an arbitration meeting in the bureau's auditorium at 2 p.m. yesterday. The meeting had not reached a resolution by 7 p.m. The details are as follows:

Director's Address

Gu Yuxiu, the Director of the Education Bureau, delivered a speech first, stating that both principals and teachers are working hard for the sacred cause of education, and should have a spirit of sharing weal and woe. Both sides should have a spirit of the rule of law regarding school measures, and all words and deeds must be reasonable. Regarding the Zijiang Elementary School's failure to renew the contracts of teachers, he hoped that they could arbitrate together so as to achieve a satisfactory solution.

Reports from Both Sides

Next, the parties concerned gave reports. The teacher representative Ren Yuying first described the process of not being rehired. Then, Principal Jin Rizhang reported the reasons for not renewing the contracts of the teachers, claiming that Luo Shuxiu had broken the head of student Sun Defu with a stone inkstone, Jiang Shumei arbitrarily dismissed classes, Han Liming was willful and had poor teaching skills, and Chen Lanying and Ren Yuying repeatedly refused school guidance and neglected their duties.

Representatives' Opinions

After listening to the reports from both sides, Director Gu asked the teachers' side if they had any objections to the reasons stated by the principal for not renewing the contracts. Each teacher then briefly reported on their usual service situation and gave some explanations for the points pointed out by the principal. Then, the representative of the Elementary School Teachers Occupational Security Promotion Association spoke, hoping that the above-mentioned teachers could continue to be hired. Representatives from the Joint Association of Primary and Secondary Schools and the Municipal Education Association also spoke in succession, hoping that the principal and teachers could coordinate, but teachers with serious faults might as well be asked to change their environment, so as to benefit both sides.

Direct Negotiations

Finally, Director Gu earnestly expressed that he would find a way to arrange for the teachers who were not rehired to be placed in municipal schools, and individually asked each teacher whether they were willing to accept this. At that time, because the representative of the Occupational Security Association had other opinions, no decision was reached. Therefore, Director Gu summoned the parties concerned to the bureau office again for direct consultation, but there was no result. Therefore, it was decided to continue discussing the matter next Monday and be sure to find a fair solution.

[Another Report] The Zijiang Elementary School Board of Directors has recently decided to extend the employment of four of the five dismissed teachers. The Shenjiang Elementary School Board of Directors has also decided to reopen the school.

### Beiping Plans to Build a University City on the Original Site of Yuanmingyuan

The emperors of the Qing Dynasty held court here every early spring. It was destroyed by the Anglo-French allied forces during the reign of Emperor Xianfeng, and the entire garden was in ruins. Now, cultural circles in Ping City have suggested building a "university city" on the original site of the garden, and moving all the universities in Beiping there, so as to form the characteristic of a cultural city.

### Mayor's Cup Preliminaries: Longjie Team's Impressive Performance Eliminates the British Navy by a Score of Three to One

The first act of the Mayor's Cup football preliminary was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3 p.m. yesterday, with Longjie playing against the British Navy. As a result, Longjie, with its second-tier team, was able to eliminate the British Navy by a score of three to one. The score was two to zero in the first half. However, Longjie's actions during the match yesterday were quite inappropriate. The up-and-coming team should be cautious.

Ten minutes after the start of the match, Longjie's Gu Dirong had a good opportunity and scored a goal. Soon, Gu Dirong scored another goal. The British army tried repeatedly to counterattack without success. The score was 2 to 0 in the first half, with Longhua taking the lead. In the second half, the offensive was still controlled by the British Navy, but they could not find their way in for a long time. Longjie's Gu Dirong made a central breakthrough and scored again, taking an absolute advantage of 3 to 0. The British Navy made every effort to counterattack, and Williams finally headed in a goal. The British Navy was finally eliminated, and Longjie was promoted to the next level. The score was three to one.

### Constructing Dramatic Culture (Part 1)

— Tang Shaohua

——From Emperor Ming of Tang to Confucius——

In the past, our nation's drama circles worshiped an ancestral master, said to be Mr. Li Longji, Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty. In his later years, Emperor Ming of Tang grew weary of politics and knew well how to seek noble entertainment, even leading a troupe of Pear Garden disciples in performing plays himself. However, in the entirety of his life, his relationship with drama was not very close. If one were to speak of someone close to drama, it should be another Li – Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang Dynasty. He was an emperor who was a complete and thorough performer, spending his life acting and being cremated with musical instruments after his death. However, he lived slightly later and could not catch up with Emperor Ming of Tang in terms of being revered.

Performing was definitely not a profession in primitive times. However, after drama became a specialized occupation, those engaged in it were always in a disadvantageous position. Despite later performers calling themselves Pear Garden disciples or students of the emperor, in terms of their profession, they could never escape the fate of "serving others with their looks and talents." This fixed fate clearly had a master-slave distinction. Emperor Ming of Tang's leadership of the Pear Garden was nothing more than training a group of more satisfactory slaves for his own enjoyment. When slaves forget their own personality and instead make him a master and a god, it is no wonder that later Pear Garden disciples are universally regarded as actors.

Other Tang Ming Emperors, whether named Li or not, are those who, from ancient times to the present, have had relationships with actors from a perspective of entertainment. Although these people are not emperors, they all have the same psychology as Emperor Ming of Tang. Their love and appreciation of actors is based on the relationship between actors performing and them deriving entertainment. Beyond this, they do not know what acting is, and what reason there is for acting to exist other than to provide entertainment. Emperor Ming of Tang certainly did not specially set up a troupe of performers to satirize himself because he lacked people's satirical advice. At the same time, performers who revered Emperor Ming of Tang as their ancestral master were afraid of not pleasing their superiors and therefore engaged in performing. This kind of relationship constitutes an industry similar to "selling laughter," so the status of its practitioners cannot help but fall into a disadvantageous position.

Now, to invigorate and extricate ourselves, the best method is to first overthrow the Tang Ming Emperor, overthrow thousands and millions of Tang Ming Emperors. Anyone who teaches someone to serve others with their looks and talents, or who specializes in using other people's looks and talents for their own enjoyment, is a Tang Ming Emperor and should be overthrown! Destroy the idol of the Tang Ming Emperor and then, from the industry itself, strengthen the effect of satire—isn't everyone singing loudly now that drama is education?

Speaking of education, our nation's education circles in the past also worshiped an ancestral master, who was the Sage Confucius.

In fact, Confucius is not only the god of education, but his relationship with drama is even closer because he once advocated a dramatic education movement. Even earlier than Confucius, there may have been the Duke of Zhou, who also deeply recognized the value of drama. However, due to the remoteness of the era and the uncertainty of the existence of writings, the discussion of this field of knowledge is not as detailed and clear as what Confucius advocated. (To be continued)

### Silhouettes of Theater People in the Rear

— Tie Mei

Shi Ruilin

She loves to talk about her student life, and she is most proud of her daring and outstanding skills of riding a bicycle in the city of Beiping. She cannot forget those playful and laughing years, which are everyone's favorite childhood.

She is a student at an art school, specializing in sculpting. Every day she is seen with a pair of muddy hands, and her room is full of piles of mud. When sculpting, she often likes to transform the shapes of others to fit her "ideal of beauty." But others do not understand this, and she often gets so angry that she smashes her favorite statues into pieces. However, when she sees that the shattered mud is beyond saving, she cries sadly and regretfully. This is an interesting personality, and it can also be said to be because she is too loyal to her own ideals.

After the fall of Beiping, she lived a painful life for many years. An active personality did not allow her to stay any longer. She loves acting, and acting often cannot but remind people of the motherland and freedom. So, she resolutely left her home with her father, mother, brother, and sister, and went to the Great Rear Area. When she arrived in Chongqing and saw the lively and vigorous theater life, especially the noble goal of acting for freedom and the people, she deeply loved it. Because the starting point was so beautiful and correct, she became an actress with the best temperament on stage. As long as she can take on a role, she is happy to work hard to study and perform it.

After arriving in the rear area, in a few years, she has acted in many plays, and each character shows her unique insights. In "The Model Teacher for All Generations," she will play an interesting and humorous character. At that time, the audience in Shanghai will deeply remember her name.

Zhang Yan

Zhang Yan comes from the northwest plateau, his body as strong as a calf, his face showing a bright red color. He comes from a long way away, and when you look at his forward-looking pace, he is like a patriot stepping on a bloody path, opening up a future for mankind. That image will always leave you with a calm impression.

His wildness is not only seen in his fiery eyes and rugged face but also felt in his voice, which is full of life. Perhaps it is because he is such a simple and strong character that when he performs such characters, you especially feel a compelling force.

I remember that when he played the ghost in "Hamlet," everyone was chased by his soul-stirring voice of revenge and felt terror. The entire stage was filled with dark clouds and flames, what a tragic and cruel scene!

His wildness also makes him like living in the wild, liking the sun, and liking to sing to his heart's content. The young lad, how happy he is living!

He has acted in many plays, Yue Fei is one of his best plays, Zeng Hao in "Peking Man," and Hao Shunfeng in "The Big Circus" have all received praise. This is an actor who has already achieved success, especially in his life and attitude towards art, not counting fame or profit, but only an honesty and straightforwardness. He can be a good friend to people, and he can flip tables and kick benches because of other people's mistakes and selfishness. All of this comes from their simplicity and "wildness," and I also hope that he will always maintain such a naive heart.

### The Actions of Farce

— Ying Yu

Once I was taking a tram home, and all the seats in the carriage were full. Diagonally opposite me sat a well-dressed, short middle-aged man. Next to him was a large, burly White Russian woman. After sitting down, this neatly dressed little man quickly glanced at the White Russian woman, then quickly busied himself arranging his Zhongshan suit coat. Then he turned around in his seat to take out money to give to the ticket seller, skillfully clipping the coupon book between his right index and ring fingers. He turned around again to put the change back into his pocket, patting it lightly to make sure it was safe. Then he rearranged his Zhongshan suit coat and sat down properly. After only a few seconds, he started moving around in his seat again. This time he took out an eyeglass case and a white handkerchief. He took out his gold-rimmed glasses, turned around to put the eyeglass case back, and then used the large handkerchief to wipe the lenses clean. Then he put on the glasses and wiped his forehead and nose with the handkerchief before turning around again to put the large handkerchief back. Once again, he rearranged his Zhongshan suit coat and sat down properly. Two seconds later, he moved his arm to adjust its position, and at the same time used the thumb of his left hand to turn the dark purple gemstone on the ring on his left ring finger...

His actions were continuous, endless, and fast, flexible, and impeccable. While he was busying himself like a fly, the large, burly White Russian woman sitting next to him was overwhelmed and unbearable. She first showed an impatient look, which had no effect. Then she glared fiercely once or twice, which still had no effect. Finally, taking advantage of the fact that the person next to me got off, she suddenly moved over and sat next to me. At that time, the little man was reaching into his pocket, engaging in another round of vigorous activity.

I quietly observed and couldn't help but admire him greatly because this wonderful performance by the middle-aged little man and the White Russian woman was very comedic. Especially the agile and busy middle-aged little man is of reference value. Because his every move is clear, fast, rich, complete, infinitely varied, and breathtaking. This is really a good model for the actions of farce!

### The Art of Speaking

— Meng Qing

Our people do not pay much attention to the art of speaking. This is mostly because after Qin completed the feudal autocracy, it strictly forbade the people of the world to speak casually. The feudal monarchs of successive dynasties continued to promote such harsh laws. Therefore, the Chinese language has not been able to develop. To recreate the lost art of speaking that has been lost for more than two thousand years would be of great help to the progress of China's new culture. In other words, one of the tasks of the New Culture Movement is to recreate China's language and the art of speaking.

The problem of language on stage is particularly serious. Usually what is written on paper cannot be read, and at the same time, what can be said is difficult to write. Therefore, at present, spoken drama can only adopt a kind of "vernacular," which is not spoken language. This characteristic of writing is only closer to spoken language than classical Chinese, but it is limited. To a certain extent, it becomes as stubborn and rigid as classical Chinese, unwilling to conform to the spoken word. This is because Chinese characters have not yet reached the stage of phoneticization and are still square characters and monosyllabic characters.

According to Mr. Zhang Junxiang, the play "Romeo and Juliet" only takes two and a half hours to perform abroad, while it takes four hours to perform in Chongqing, excluding the time spent changing scenery. This is because Chinese language always has several pauses in a short sentence, while foreign languages can use the convenience of consonants and vowels to speak very quickly.

Speaking of "Romeo and Juliet," I am interested in the performance of this poetic drama with many rhymes. I really don't know how the actors of "China Electricity" at that time overcame the inherent defects of our country's language? In my estimation, many witty homophones are simply too difficult to convey the original meaning. For example, in Act 3, Scene 5, Juliet talks to her mother about the death of her cousin and the murderer Romeo, saying the following:

Juliet (pun):

Indeed, I can't reach him.

I hope it is I, myself, who avenges my cousin.

Or, like the following sentences:

Juliet (rushes out):

Truly, I will never be satisfied with Romeo unless I see him dead—my heart is so sad for my cousin.

As for performing comedies, our country's actors always suffer losses. Recently, I watched several comedy performances. The tone of "Youthful Wanderings" was leisurely and unrestrained, and the actors' recitation speed was still passable. "Miaofeng Mountain" was bright and relaxed, but I felt that most of the actors were very heavy and strenuous, unable to be fast or light. According to the results of the investigation, the performance took three and a half hours, half an hour slower than the first performance.

It can be seen that the reconstruction of the art of speaking is a matter of great significance!

Social Services

### A Faithful Reader's Accusation: Even Well-to-Do Families are Receiving Aid, Hoping All Parties Will Work Together to Benefit the Truly Poor

Editor Sir: The winter vacation is about to pass, and the new semester is imminent. Tuition fees for the next semester are indeed a serious problem for parents with economic difficulties. Fortunately, there are righteous acts such as education loans and scholarships, which allow young people who have dropped out of school to regain the opportunity to study. Their contribution to society and the nation is truly not small. However, often there are many people who have ample resources at home but still apply for scholarships. I have a relative who does just that. Every day, they take their elderly and young children to listen to operas and watch plays, even watching the afternoon performance and rushing to the night performance. They buy jewelry and lend money at interest, but they still apply for scholarships. Isn't this depriving truly poor students of their opportunity to study? At the same time, it also violates the purpose of scholarships and is even unfair to the many benefactors who are enthusiastically helping students. This matter concerns the public, so I hope that the authorities in charge can strictly review the students applying for scholarships and not allow a group of truly poor students to lose the opportunity to study. At the same time, I have heard that civil servants in general state-owned enterprises all have a portion of scholarships for their children, so many more can be reduced among loan students, and more orphans or destitute outstanding students can be rescued. Yang Mei Qing respectfully submits

I admire Mr. Yang's opinion very much! It is inevitable that students' parents have a kind of immoral behavior, the most shameless style. This newspaper has also encountered many of the same facts in handling scholarships over the years. Therefore, in addition to asking the principals of each school to be responsible for recommending and spot-checking family circumstances, we also ask the students who receive assistance to secretly investigate and report as much as possible. If it is indeed a well-to-do family receiving aid, not only will their qualifications be revoked, but their secrets will also be exposed in the newspaper to show a slight punishment! This time, this newspaper is cooperating with the Shanghai Education Loan Committee, and we are also paying close attention to this point. We hope that faithful readers will assist us from the sidelines and report the facts as much as possible. At the same time, we hope that the students and parents who are applying will release their conscience and not encroach on the rights of students who are indeed poor. This is as meritorious as donating your own money. (Editor)
