### Zhou Enlai Flew Back to Beijing Last Night; Rumors of New Demands from Yan'an; Date for the Military Three-Person Committee Meeting to be Decided Soon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, along with Li Minran and three aides, returned to Nanjing by Marshall's special plane at 6:10 PM on the 9th. Lu Dingyi did not return, and Mao Zedong did not come. Communist Party representatives stationed in Nanjing, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, and others, went to the airport to welcome them. After disembarking, Zhou went directly to his private residence in Meiyuan New Village. After a brief rest, he went to the CCP office to discuss the results of his return to Yan'an for instructions with Dong, Li, and others. It is said that Zhou spent about 43 hours in Yan'an. Apart from less than 11 hours of sleep for two nights, he spent the remaining 32 hours mostly on laborious reports, lengthy talks, and various tense meetings. Therefore, although Zhou's appearance was the same as usual after returning to Beijing, he seemed extremely fatigued. It is reported that Zhou will present the results of his return to Yan'an for instructions to Marshall on the 10th and exchange views with Marshall on the major preconditions for the Military Three-Person Committee meeting. According to well-informed sources, the Yan'an side has, based on Zhou's suggestions, put forward specific new demands. Among the conditions, the demands for the Northeast, in addition to hoping to revise the "5-to-1" ratio of the troop reorganization plan, also include political and economic demands. The date for the Military Three-Person Committee meeting is rumored to be decided on the morning of the 10th. If circumstances permit, this meeting can be held at any time.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] A responsible person from a relevant intelligence agency stated: The CCP's demands regarding the government reorganization issue are to increase the number of State Council members from eight to ten. As for the allocation of ministerial positions in the Executive Yuan, the CCP is requesting the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Interior. In addition, they are requesting the governorships of the four provinces in North China: Hebei, Shandong, Rehe, and Chahar, with an attached note stating that if there are problems with Rehe Province, the eastern provinces can be adjusted accordingly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The day after the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist troops in the Northeast attacked the National Army, and at the same time, the Communist troops in North China suddenly launched an offensive. When this unfortunate news reached the capital, all those concerned about peace were shocked. However, the government's attitude was extremely calm. Since today is a Sunday, official personnel are remaining silent. The so-called "third party" hoping for an extension of the ceasefire period felt particularly impacted after hearing this bad news.

### Northeast Communist Troops Disobey Ceasefire Order, Attacking National Army on Four Fronts; Rehe Communist Troops also Advancing Along the Railway

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th, 8:00 PM] (1) The Communist troops besieging Lafa Station and the Old Station continued to increase last night, totaling twelve regiments including the First Division, Second Division, Independent Brigade, and Second Garrison Brigade, with eight mountain guns and twelve mortars. By noon on the 9th, they were fiercely attacking the National Army. All houses and bunkers near the Old Station were destroyed. More than 200 National Army officers and soldiers were killed or wounded on the night of the 7th. (2) The Communist troops near Taolaizhao continued to increase, seemingly planning to besiege the National Army stationed there. (3) Last night, near Yingchengzi and Qianhou Mayantun, southeast of Haicheng, the Communist troops launched a night attack on the National Army from a certain high ground and the Sharui River, but were repelled. As of the time of the dispatch, the Communist troops were still attacking the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] Since the ceasefire order was issued, the National Army has obeyed the order to cease pursuit. However, starting at 3:00 PM on the 7th, the Communist troops launched attacks on our defending troops on four fronts: (1) About 700-800 Communist troops near Halahai attacked our defending troops starting at 3:00 PM on the 7th, resulting in over 40 casualties. (2) The 62nd Regiment of the 21st Brigade of the Communist troops near Taolaizhao attacked our defending troops starting at 3:00 PM on the 7th. At 9:00 PM at night, they increased their forces by another 700-800 men and expanded their fierce attack on our defending troops. (3) At 4:00 PM on the 7th, 500-600 Communist troops launched a fierce attack on our defending troops at Wukeshu from the Yushu County area, and three of our soldiers were captured. (4) At 3:00 PM on the 7th, the Second Garrison Brigade and the First Division of the Communist troops launched a large-scale attack on our defending troops at Lafa, resulting in fierce fighting. The Communist troops in the above four locations violated the ceasefire order. The National Army, for the sake of self-defense, repelled them. However, south of Lafa Station, Communist troops from Jiaohe transported troops northward by train for reinforcement, and the defending troops are closely guarding against this.

[United Press, Changchun, 8th] A spokesman for the forward headquarters of the National Army here stated at a special press conference this evening: Three hours after the ceasefire order took effect yesterday afternoon, the Communist troops violated the agreement and launched attacks on four strongholds of the National Army. The attacked strongholds are stepping stones for the National Army's advance towards Harbin: (1) Taolaizhao, on the Changchun-Harbin Railway line, seven miles north of the Songhua River, (2) Halahai, forty miles west of Taolaizhao, (3) Wukeshu, thirty-five miles east of Taolaizhao, (4) Lafa, a railway junction 160 miles east of Changchun. The offensives against Lafa and Taolaizhao are major battles and are still ongoing. The Communist troops attacking Taolaizhao were reinforced by more than 700 men before 9:00 PM last night. The spokesman emphasized that before receiving orders from Chairman Chiang, the National Army will continue to abide by the ceasefire agreement and will not launch attacks, advances, or pursuits, but will defend their strongholds. Brigadier General Baird, a senior American official of the Executive Headquarters now in Changchun, has been informed of this news, and it is hoped that he can send officials from Changchun to investigate. The representatives of both the Nationalists and the Communists on the forward executive team of the Executive Headquarters have not yet arrived in Changchun. At the same time, Nationalist personnel in Beiping today accused the Communist troops in Rehe of again attacking Chaoyang and the Pingquan Railway. The Propaganda Department's office in Beiping stated: Gong Xin (transliteration), the commander of the Communist troops in the Rehe area, is directing more than 10,000 Communist troops to prepare to attack Lingyuan, located between Chaoyang and Chengde. 15,000 Communist troops are concentrated near Jianping, sixty-five miles north of Lingyuan, preparing to attack Chaoyang.

### Artificial Housing Shortage

Local Authorities Study Allocation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In order to solve the housing shortage problem in the capital, the authorities conducted a city-wide survey of vacant houses, which has now been completed. According to statistics, in the Eastern District alone, there are 1,340 vacant houses that are unoccupied. The situation in other districts can be imagined. From this, it can be seen that the artificial factors are the main cause of the housing shortage in Nanjing. The authorities are currently studying allocation and contract-making methods.

### Mourning Deceased Friends and Handling Private Affairs; Shao Lizi Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing; Holds Relatively Optimistic View of the Current Situation

[Our Dispatch] Shao Lizi, Secretary of the Political Consultative Council, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning with his wife, Fu Xuewen.

In the morning, he went to the Jade Buddha Temple to mourn the death of the late Council member Ye Chucang. In the afternoon, he attended the memorial service for Zhu Shaoping, the late Consul-General of the Philippines. This trip has no other tasks, and he will return to Nanjing by express train tonight. He met with reporters at his private residence yesterday and discussed the current situation. He said: "I believe that we should not be overly optimistic, but pessimism is also useless. We should adopt a relatively optimistic attitude, because our country is now moving towards the path of peace and unification. Even if there are difficulties, we should do our best to overcome them." When reporters asked Shao whether the Comprehensive Group of the Political Consultative Conference would resume discussions after the ceasefire order was issued on the 15th, Shao said, "I believe that the Military Three-Person Committee will first resume immediately. As for political talks, the government is currently exchanging views with all parties at any time. After the representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic League arrive in Beijing, we have maintained contact with them throughout." Reporters also asked Shao about the content of past exchanges of views with various parties. He said: "All negotiation principles are included in the ceasefire order." Shao finally stated that all parties must work hard for the future development of the overall situation. Since Chairman Chiang returned from the Northeast, he and Special Envoy Marshall have held earnest discussions on avoiding military conflict. As for the ceasefire talks on the 15th, some people in society still think that the time is short, but in my opinion, it is more than sufficient.

### Wang Lingji's Remarks

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Our reporter interviewed Wang Lingji, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, on the 9th to inquire about the suicide of Cheng Mao's type, Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Field Grain Office, and the situation of grain administration. According to reports, Cheng was a loyal and responsible grain official who was conscientious in his work and cared about his reputation. He suffered from the fact that after the great war, the fields in Jiangxi were barren and agricultural production declined, making it difficult to collect grain. Although food was obtained with great difficulty, it could not be transported due to the lack of transportation tools, resulting in worry and indignation, leading to a passive suicide. Wang also stated that Jiangxi is a rice-producing area and can be self-sufficient, but continuous disasters have led to a shortage. In the future, a public cultivation method will be implemented on a township-guarantee basis to promote production and enrich the people's livelihood.

### UNRRA Relief Supplies Shipped to China; Our Country Requests Extension of Deadline; Far East Area Conference Next Held in Shanghai

[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] The Chinese representative to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Far East Committee has requested that the deadline for shipping UNRRA relief supplies to China be extended to beyond March 31 of next year. The reason given is that the transportation and distribution of relief supplies after they arrive in China are quite slow. At today's meeting, the committee decided to postpone a decision on whether to request UNRRA's approval of China's request until the next meeting on July 17. The committee also passed a resolution proposed by US representative Kilpatrick, advocating that UNRRA and the Chinese government agree on an agreement for the Chinese government to provide a sufficient amount of local currency to ensure that the relief distribution plan can be fully implemented. UNRRA Acting Director-General Rhee, speaking at the meeting about the release of information related to UNRRA's plan in China, said: UNRRA's shipments sometimes have to be kept secret, because speculators in the Chinese market have taken advantage of UNRRA's shipments to stir up trouble in the market.

It is reported that provincial and municipal representatives raised a total of 48 objections to various proposals, 28 of which were related to the inability to balance revenue and expenditure. For example, in Suiyuan Province, due to the barren land and poor people, the province's finances have always been in deficit. If the  system is changed, the difficulties will be even greater. It is generally expected that before the completion of demobilization and troop reorganization, the central government will still have to find ways to maintain the poor provinces after the implementation of the new system.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The meeting on implementing the revised fiscal revenue and expenditure system continued on the 10th. After the proposals were discussed, the closing ceremony was held.

### Editorial: Save the Millions of Overseas Chinese in the East Indies!

Since the outbreak of the Indonesian independence movement, the situation in the Dutch East Indies has fallen into chaos. Although negotiations have been held between the two sides, the conflicts have not stopped and have even tended to escalate. "When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." How many of our overseas Chinese are there in the areas controlled by the authorities of the East Indies Republic! Looking out to the overseas territories, we are constantly anxious about the lives and property of our millions of overseas Chinese. The recent massacres of overseas Chinese are inhumane and cannot but make people feel grief-stricken!

According to foreign news agency reports: In Tanggerang City, west of Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, according to the agreement signed between the Netherlands and the East Indies Republic on May 28, it should have been occupied by the Dutch army. However, after the East Indies Independence Army withdrew, terrorists suddenly carried out a large-scale massacre in the area where overseas Chinese lived on June 5, which was appalling. According to initial estimates, as many as 600 overseas Chinese were killed, and 50 children were burned to death. According to the latest report, the situation has escalated, and the massacre has intensified. Nearly 3,000 overseas Chinese have been killed, and the fate of 25,000 people in the area is unknown. The overseas Chinese area has been almost completely destroyed, becoming a pile of ashes, and the East Indies people in Maok City have arrested all the overseas Chinese. However, the Dutch authorities are still sitting idly by. Although our government has made representations, there are still no effective measures to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese. After eight years of Chinese resistance, we are said to be one of the four or five powers after the victory, but our overseas Chinese have become lambs to be slaughtered. Anyone with blood would not be able to control their rage!

Since an appalling massacre has already occurred, what good is it to simply cry and feel heartbroken! The first step is to investigate the responsibility for the occurrence of this incident. In legal terms, according to the agreement of May 28, Tanggerang City was to be taken over by the Dutch army. Therefore, after the withdrawal of the East Indies Independence Army, the local order and security should be the responsibility of the Dutch government. In other words, the Dutch government has the responsibility to protect the safety of life and property of the overseas Chinese there. After the massacre, it should immediately take steps to rescue them, and cannot shirk responsibility simply because the murderers are East Indies terrorists. Our diplomatic authorities have made serious representations to the Dutch government, proposing four measures: punishing the murderers, providing compensation, reserving our right to claim damages, and that the Netherlands immediately take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. These can be said to be the minimum legitimate demands. But it must be understood that the crux of the current problem is not diplomatic negotiations, but what emergency measures to take to save the lives of these millions of overseas Chinese in danger, so as not to have the disaster of continued massacre. Regarding this point, we feel very sorry that the Allied authorities in the Dutch East Indies have turned a deaf ear to the suggestions and appeals of our Consul General Jiang Jialian in Batavia and have not adopted them.

Although the massacre of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies this time was carried out by irrational East Indies terrorists, it is difficult to deny that the rift between the overseas Chinese and the local ethnic groups will be deepened as a result. It is said that the East Indies Independence Army saw that some overseas Chinese were serving in the Dutch army, and mistakenly believed that the overseas Chinese had the fact of "helping the tyrant," so they used massacre to retaliate. In our view, this explanation must not be reasonable. For hundreds of years, our overseas Chinese and the indigenous ethnic groups have lived in peace. Even if they are usually squeezed out, they can endure it and are unwilling to argue. This time the massacre of overseas Chinese in the East Indies must have a different background! We have to tell the people of the East Indies: China has always sympathized with the Indonesian independence movement. When the United Nations Security Council discussed the Dutch East Indies issue in January of this year, our representative Gu Weijun expressed his support in principle for the proposal of the Ukrainian representative. Therefore, the people of the East Indies should recognize friends and enemies, and distinguish between right and wrong; otherwise, the authorities of the East Indies will not only arouse the resentment of our 450 million Chinese compatriots, but also lose international sympathy for their independence movement. Looking at the new situation in the post-war Pacific, why can't the authorities of the East Indies and the Dutch government negotiate a real result? You must recognize that in the future Pacific, besides China, which has never invaded, how many countries are there that truly sympathize with you and can truly help you to become independent?

In short, the occurrence of this unfortunate event at a time when our country is actively promoting the repatriation of overseas Chinese is enough to show that the status of our overseas Chinese after the war has not only no hope of improvement; but also that the crises they will encounter in the future are just beginning. For the sake of a permanent solution, our responsible authorities should find ways to obtain a good solution, so as to lay the foundation for the centuries-old plan for overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.

It is painful enough to talk about! The overseas Chinese have not failed the motherland, but we have indeed failed the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese have worked hard to pioneer the wilderness, but for hundreds of years, they have been oppressed and swallowed their tears. It was not easy for the motherland to fight a bloody war, and the overseas Chinese seemed to be able to hold their heads high in spirit. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the ravages of the Japanese invaders and the threats of the local authorities who colluded with the enemy, the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia suffered terribly. How could only the Dutch East Indies be like this? Unexpectedly, the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Allied countries won, and our tearful overseas Chinese still have to suffer even more serious massacres. Where does this start? In the past few months, overseas Chinese in Vietnam have been massacred and heavily taxed in the midst of French-Vietnamese conflicts, which everyone must still remember. Overseas Chinese in Singapore have also been massacred by British police, and remittances back home have been restricted. Several thousand overseas Chinese who have been "reported" and oppressed by the Japanese invaders for several years have no hope of survival. This spring, the natives of the Malay Peninsula also carried out large-scale massacres of overseas Chinese, insulting our country, killing our overseas Chinese leaders, and burning our houses. The bloodstains are still visible everywhere. In January and February of this year, anti-Chinese incidents also occurred in Thailand, and many overseas Chinese were killed. Even in Portuguese Timor, as recently as last winter, there were even strange events of overseas Chinese being arrested by the authorities for anti-Japanese demonstrations. In short, in various places in Southeast Asia after the victory, overseas Chinese are often massacred, and the loss of property and business is needless to say. We cannot help but wonder if the blood of our compatriots in this war has been shed in vain! We have received such external stimulation, and we can only feel even more heartbroken for those who are deliberately destroying domestic peace and reducing our international status. We urge the Communist troops to wash their hands quickly for the sake of the overseas Chinese. We must use the strength of domestic unity to save the millions of overseas Chinese in the East Indies!

### Local Correspondences: Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Frequently Mobilizes, Attempting to Attack Our Recovered Areas, Violating Mediation by Huaiyin Executive Group; Baipu Eastern Suburbs Also Attacked by Communist Army

[Our Nantong Correspondent] The Communist army in Northern Jiangsu has been frequently mobilized recently, and it seems that it intends to attack our recovered areas. The Communist army recently transferred the 26th Regiment, 38th Regiment, and Dare-to-Die Team from the Taixing County area, commanded by Mei Jiasheng. They are recruiting soldiers in Juegang, Beixingqiao, and Qianzhen. In the Yuxi Erjiazhen area, there are about two regiments of Tao Yong's troops, equipped with Japanese-style weapons, organizing peasants' resistance and workers' resistance. At 12:00 noon on the 4th, in the vicinity of Jiangzaogang, and in the Zhenchang and Yusha areas, there were more than 10,000 Communist troops, requisitioning civilian laborers. At the same time, six regiments of the Communist army were gathered in the Sanxuzhen area. At 10:00 PM on the 4th, they began to attack the Guanyinshan Nationalist army defense line. At that time, the Nationalist army calmly responded and fought bravely. The sound of cannons and machine guns was heard all night long, and the residents could hear it clearly. By 5:00 AM, the Communist army was gradually unable to support itself and was finally repelled by the Nationalist army. The Nationalist army suffered no losses. While the Huaiyin Executive Group was still mediating in the Nantong area, the Communist army acted in this way, which is a violation of good faith. It is not known how the group will handle this.

Another dispatch, Baipu, Rugao: The Communist army stationed in Linzi suddenly launched an attack on the eastern suburbs of Baipu Town at 12:30 AM on May 30 with a force of about 200 soldiers. After a calm response from the Nationalist army stationed there and the Rugao County Security Team, the attack was unsuccessful. A member of the executive group, who was traveling from Rugao to Nantong, after hearing the news, immediately sent US representative Brandhurst to inspect. He saw that the civilian houses in the area were riddled with bullets, and the new wheat and rice in the fields were trampled beyond recognition. They complained one after another. Lieutenant Colonel Brandhorst deeply regretted that the CCP's violation of the truce agreement was even more proven. (Zhi) Posted on the 5th

### Important US-Philippines Issues to be Resolved Before Philippine Independence

[United Press International, Washington, 9th] With Philippine independence imminent, several critical issues concerning the Philippine Islands remain unresolved in the US Congress. Both American and Filipino parties insist that these issues should be decided before the Philippines' independence on July 4th, and are therefore urging Congress to take swift action. These issues are: (1) The Filipino Naturalization Act; (2) The Military Assistance Act; (3) A bill proposing the return of US government-owned Philippine securities worth $6.2 million to the islands; (4) The Aid to Philippine Veterans and their Families Act; (5) An urgent need to compile a budget for a $400 million loan to assist the Philippines in its post-war reconstruction.

While the above and many other issues urgently await resolution by the US and Philippine governments, plans for Washington and Manila to celebrate the July 4th Independence Day ceremonies are nearing completion. The United States has notified the 51 countries with which it maintains diplomatic relations of its intention to grant the Philippines independence, and Manila has invited representatives from all countries to attend the July 4th Independence Day ceremonies in Manila. (This newspaper was the first to report news of disturbances occurring in the Philippines yesterday.)

### Supplementing the Regular Air Force: US Forms Aviation Reserve, Engaging in Large-Scale Training at Bases Nationwide, Mobilizing 4.5 Million in Case of War

[United Press International, New York, 8th] The United States is currently organizing a "civilian" air force of 6,000 aircraft, with the ultimate goal of expanding this reserve of aviators to one million. According to the Department of the Army announcement, this potential air force, sufficient to supplement the US regular army, will consist of over 200,000 individuals engaging in part-time training at bases throughout the forty-eight states. The organization is divided into two parts: the "Air National Guard" and the "Air Reserve," a component of the regular army. Both will recruit volunteers using a conscription method similar to the army's initial recruitment at the beginning of the war. According to the planned design, the Air National Guard and Air Reserve will be under the command of Lieutenant General Stratemeyer's US Air Defense Command, headquartered at Mitchel Field on Long Island, New York. Stratemeyer served as the commander of the Allied Air Forces in the China-India-Burma Theater during World War II.

The Air Reserve plan will be implemented in July, with pilot training beginning at 130 military bases and gradually expanding to all aspects of air combat and air defense. The New York City air defense team is in the first batch of training, having launched a recruitment drive for 700 aviators. There will be 84 Air National Guard bases nationwide. Units will train for several hours each week, with more extensive training taking place for several weeks each summer. The peacetime US Air Force numbers approximately 875,000 personnel, a goal that can be reached through this second line of air defense training. In the event of war, this reserve, in addition to the regular army, would allow the United States to mobilize an air force of 4.5 million within twelve months of the start of hostilities.

In describing the importance of the Air National Guard and Air Reserve to the future of the United States, Stratemeyer stated, "In this age of air power and the atom, the superiority of the United States Air Force is the greatest guarantee of our nation's lasting peace and security. The superiority of the US Air Force is a legacy of the Second World War, and this legacy must be preserved until the United Nations can guarantee international security."

### Vincent's Speech: Security and Peace are Fundamental to Life

[United States Information Service, Lexington, Kentucky, 8th] Treasury Secretary Vincent, who was appointed as Chief Justice of the United States by President Truman this week, stated last night that security and peace are fundamental to life. Americans need security and peace, and so do people in every other country in the world. Vincent made his remarks during a commencement speech at his alma mater, the University of Kentucky. He elucidated the general American views on freedom, security, and peace. He said, "We hope that the next generation will not have to shed blood and give their lives to preserve our way of life again. We need our country to maintain a strong position so that international thugs will not dare to run rampant and be able to defend ourselves in the event of another attack. Most importantly, we hope that all nations cooperate with each other to ensure that they do not violate each other. This is what we mean by the need for peace."

### US to Consult the Far Eastern Commission for MacArthur to Secure Power; Administrative Report on the Occupation of Japan in May Published

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th, Combined Dispatches] Reliable sources: The United States is preparing subsequent measures to secure power for MacArthur at the Far Eastern Commission in Washington and has solicited MacArthur's opinions and criticisms of the proposed statement that has already been sent to Tokyo. It is reported that the US intends to publicly announce this statement to clarify its position on MacArthur's execution of the policy of occupying Japan, and will specifically point out the authority of the Far Eastern Commission, and the extent to which the Far Eastern Commission can oppose the directives issued directly to MacArthur by the US government.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 9th] MacArthur today released the May administrative report on the occupation of Japan, analyzing the gradual progress of democracy after Japan's liberation. It roughly stated that Japan does not desire revolution, nor reaction, but only orderly progress. The psychology of the Japanese people clearly seeks to avoid extremes, neither leaning to the left nor to the right. In the Japanese general election in April of this year, neither the Japanese government nor the Allied military authorities interfered, and the Japanese people were able to elect freely for the first time in decades. They chose a broad middle ground. The Japanese people continue to maintain a good attitude towards the occupation forces, and Japan has taken the first step on the path of establishing a responsible and popular government in the future. However, the Japanese political situation is still highly volatile, and the overlapping of political parties and candidates reflects the chaos of the transitional period. All activities of wartime political parties were strictly controlled by the government. Now that the shackles have been lifted, the activities of political parties are in a state of turmoil. It is not yet clear what will dominate the political life of Japan in the coming years, and the final party platform has yet to be drafted. However, one thing is certain: the suppression of Japanese political progress by the Japanese military and financial cliques has been largely removed. Japan is no longer a "police state," and the power of military manipulation of politics has disappeared. Since the issuance of the purge directive on January 4, most warmongers and extreme nationalists have been removed from office, and their qualifications as members of parliament have also been revoked.

### UN Secretary-General Lie to Visit Europe on a Regular Basis

### Terrible Bacterial Weapons

Cost Much Smaller Than Atomic Bomb, Radioactive Effect a Thousand Times Greater Than Poison Gas

[Reuters, New York, 8th] Collier's magazine states that the United States currently has five agencies researching bacterial warfare tactics. Over the past three years, British, American, and Canadian scientists have invented many bacterial warfare weapons. If bacterial warfare were to be implemented today, its level of terror would exceed that of atomic warfare. The US Army began conducting bacterial warfare research in December 1943 and later collaborated with scientists from Canada and the United Kingdom. Cholera, bubonic plague, and sleeping sickness are the most obvious diseases in bacterial warfare. The cost of bacterial warfare weapons is only one-fortieth that of an atomic bomb, so small countries can also secretly manufacture bacterial warfare weapons by using their university laboratories, distilleries, etc., and avoid inspection by the Security Council. According to military experts, radioactive bacteria are a thousand times more effective than radioactive poison gas.

### Agreement Reached on Repatriation of Allied Assets in Italy, But Disputes Remain Over the Method of Repatriation, Anglo-French Views Close on Italian-Austrian Border Issue

[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th] Bevin Spaak arrived in Paris this morning and immediately paid a visit to French Foreign Minister Bidault. Representatives of the four foreign ministers and economic experts met today to discuss ten key points in the issue of Italian compensation, especially the treatment of the property of Allied residents in Italy. The representatives agreed that Allied residents' property should be returned if documents are presented.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] The meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers continued at the Luxembourg Palace. The report drafted by the economic experts was first submitted for discussion. The main point is that all assets in Italy owned by Allied countries that were confiscated by the Fascist government should be returned to their original owners, and an agreement was immediately reached. The same issue was discussed in the afternoon for two hours and thirty minutes. This issue had been agreed upon in the morning, but the experts could not agree on the method of repatriation, and the representatives supported the opinions put forward by the experts of their respective countries, and did not give in to each other. The most important point is the issue of when the deadline should be for Allied people to request repatriation. The meeting is scheduled to continue tomorrow morning.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently made a speech in the British House of Commons, involving the issue of the affiliation of the Italian Venice Giulia region. People here are deeply anxious after hearing about it, and they believe that the British government has accepted the border line proposed by France, which is very different from what the late US President Wilson advocated. From the perspective of the Italian people, the "Wilson Line" is actually beneficial to Italy. As for the suggestions put forward by France, they were only put forward because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted on his country's position, and were not unanimously approved by the meeting of the four foreign ministers.

Whether King Humberto II of Italy will leave the country before the republic is announced, or wait until after the government is handed over, has become the most important issue for the Italian people at the moment. According to people close to the King, Humberto himself seems to want to respect public opinion and is unwilling to leave the country too early, lest it cause confusion in legal procedures.

The Italian ambassador immediately replied to US Secretary of State Byrnes, requesting US assistance in helping the country achieve a fair and honorable peace.

### East Indies Prepares to Use Force to Defend Sovereignty

He stated that if the Netherlands refuses to recognize the sovereignty of the East Indies and attempts to force the East Indies people to submit, then the East Indies people will respond with "force." Sukarno also hinted that the East Indies issue may be brought before the United Nations Security Council.

[Reuters, Batavia, 8th] Authoritative sources in Indonesia: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir has completed Indonesia's counter-proposal and is prepared to submit it to the Dutch-Indonesian authorities.

US Seamen Begin Negotiations with Employers, Threat of Strike May Disappear, Government Mediators Also Intensifying Efforts

[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The threat of a strike by seamen belonging to the American Federation of Labor disappeared today, as the Seafarers International Union of North America has begun discussing wages and working hours with West Coast shipowners after holding a vote on the strike issue today. A spokesman for the shipowners said that the talks have made "real progress." This development has apparently dispelled the possibility of a simultaneous major strike in mid-month by seamen belonging to the two major American labor organizations (the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations). At the same time, government mediators in Washington are now intensifying efforts to lift the threat of a strike by seamen belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which is scheduled for the 16th of this month.

### Theft of World's Largest Pearl: Perpetrator Sentenced to Ten Years in Absentia

[Reuters, Paris, 8th] The thief of the "Pearl of Asia," Belgian Gaulard, has not been captured since his escape on May 15th.

The State Department released their concluding impressions, all advocating that close cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is an urgent matter, and they have found no reason why it cannot be completed. The three Soviet reporters are novelist and Izvestia reporter Ehrenburg, playwright and member of the Soviet Film Committee Shaimukhamedov, and Pravda military reporter Golashinov.

### London in Fine Rain: Grand Victory Parade

Column Stretches 18 Miles, Our Troops' High Spirits Highly Welcomed

[Reuters, London, 8th] Approximately one hundred soldiers from the Chinese army participating in today's victory parade here were led by General Gui Yongqing, head of the Chinese military delegation in Britain. Everyone was full of spirit, positioned before the Allied ranks, marching through the streets, and receiving a warm welcome from the crowds.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The victory parade held on London's streets today was of a scale unparalleled among the victory celebrations of the Allied nations. At 10 AM, the King, accompanied by the Queen and Princesses Elizabeth and Rose, departed from Buckingham Palace in an open-top four-wheeled carriage amidst the cheers of the crowd. The King wore a naval admiral's uniform, and the Queen wore a crimson formal dress with ostrich feathers adorning her hat, exuding grace and elegance. The carriage was drawn by Windsor's famous horses, guarded on both sides by brightly uniformed attendants. Simultaneously, prominent figures from all sectors of British society began to arrive at the official grandstand, which was decorated in cream and sea-green colors, with various military flags adorning the pillars, symbolizing the British Empire and its Dominions. Along the Mall, where the military parade took place, the flags of the United Nations fluttered in the fine rain. When former Prime Minister Churchill and current Prime Minister Attlee arrived at the grandstand, the crowds cheered enthusiastically and continuously. Two columns of soldiers began their march from the barracks under a gloomy, rain-threatening sky, stretching for eighteen miles. Ahead of the mechanized units were several open-top cars carrying the commanders of the British Empire's various armed forces. Wherever Montgomery passed, the crowds cheered loudly. After the entire royal family was seated, the British flag was lowered amidst melodious music and replaced with the royal standard. Ten days after the Allied landings in Normandy last year, the King personally inspected the bridgehead, and this was the flag used to welcome the King to the battlefield. As the chimes of Westminster Abbey echoed, the first infantry units approached the official grandstand, including units from the Allied nations: China, the United States, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Norway, Brazil, Mexico, and Transjordan. The crowds were greatly excited as the infantry waited for the mechanized units at the Charing Cross intersection. Candies and cigarettes flew from all directions toward the soldiers' heads, like small bombs, followed by "large bombs" like oranges, apples, and sweet potatoes, with bananas being the most popular. Cups of tea were constantly passed down from windows, relayed by the crowds below to quench the soldiers' thirst. This demonstration of sympathy greatly moved the troops. Finally, amidst extreme noise, the mechanized column arrived, and the parade continued, led by motorized units, turning from Whitehall Street onto the Mall, which was the central location for the review. Immediately after the mechanized units passed, another spectacle presented itself: three hundred and eight Royal Air Force aircraft piercing through the clouds in a stunning display. The roar of the engines was like the Battle of Britain erupting again. At night, London shone brightly, like daytime, with hundreds of searchlights crisscrossing in the sky, further enhanced by fireworks, making the people happily forget to return home.

### British Troops Celebrate Victory in Camps, Anti-British Riots Erupt in Egypt

Hand Grenades Thrown Everywhere, General Strike Fails to Materialize

[Reuters, Alexandria, 8th] British troops today celebrated their victory only within their camps to avoid incidents. The Alexandria Labor Union issued a call for a general strike, but it failed to materialize due to the strong measures taken by Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi, though individual incidents such as hand grenade throwing still occurred in several parts of the city. Police in the Sidi Gaber district found a basket of hand grenades, two of which exploded; a grenade also exploded in a building under construction, injuring four workers. Several British soldiers were injured by grenade attacks while returning to their camps, with four wounded. Two other British soldiers were beaten up by six Egyptians on the streets at night. No British soldiers were seen on the streets today, and the camp gates were tightly closed. There were two small-scale demonstrations in the city, both dispersed by the police.

### Watching the Lively Scene at Home Via Television

[Reuters, London, 8th] People miles away who could not participate in the grand occasion all used television to watch the lively parade scene. Residents of Hyde, 170 miles away, were also able to see the London victory parade on television.

### Glorious Demobilization of the Youth Army: First Batch Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon; Deputy Division Commander Gu Reports on the Process to Reporters; Welcome Ceremony to be Held at the Majestic Theatre Tomorrow

The national Youth Army has begun demobilization. The 208th and 209th Divisions in the Southeast region have been concentrated in Hangzhou and will be transported back to their hometowns in batches starting today. The first batch of over two thousand demobilized Youth Army soldiers from the Shanghai Headquarters is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by train from Hangzhou this morning, arriving at the North Station around 1 PM. The advance "establishment" contingent, which came to Shanghai earlier to arrange everything, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is setting up barracks in places like Yang Guopu and Fuxing Island.

Reporting on the Organization, Training, and Demobilization Process

Gu Rongjun, Deputy Division Commander of the 209th Division, held a special reception for the Shanghai press at the Dadong Restaurant at 3 PM yesterday to report on the general situation of the organization, training, and demobilization of the Youth Army in the Southeast region. Gu first reported on the establishment of the Youth Army, saying: "When the enemy launched the Gui-Liu Campaign in the 33rd year [1944], and the domestic situation in our country became extremely tense, the Supreme Commander issued a call on April 24th of the 33rd year, and a total of 130,000 young people responded to the call and joined the army. After screening, more than 86,000 were qualified and organized into nine youth divisions (201st to 209th Divisions) and two independent regiments. The 208th and 209th Divisions were established in the Southeast region, and officers and trainers were selected by the Southeast Branch of the Military Affairs Commission. Preparations began in the first month of the lunar year last year [February 1945]. At that time, a total of 32,000 young people from the Southeast region participated in the Youth Army, and more than 28,000 passed the examination. The Supreme Commander then promulgated three principles for the organization and training of the Youth Army: 1. Select the most outstanding cadres; 2. Complete the organization and training in the shortest possible time; 3. Achieve excellent skills in a short period. Each division was matched with three regiments and one independent regiment, along with ordinary soldiers (cooks, messengers, orderlies, etc., conscripted by the division headquarters). The two divisions had a total of 36,000 people, equivalent to the number of two ordinary armies. After three months of effort, general military education was completed. Not only were the two Southeast divisions completed in such a short period, but all nine youth divisions nationwide were completed on schedule at the same time. This was because the Youth Army had extremely high quality, combined with excellent education, thus achieving this unprecedented result."

Once Prepared to Receive Taiwan

"After the victory was achieved in August last year, the 208th and 209th Divisions were ordered to march to Fuzhou for concentration, preparing to receive Taiwan. All the young officers and soldiers marched on foot for a month, arriving in Nanping, Fujian. Due to a change in plans by the General Headquarters, they were ordered to move to eastern Zhejiang. The 208th Division stationed in the Fuchun River area, and the 209th Division stationed in Yuyao and Shaoxing, and at the same time implemented reserve officer education. The Youth Army's military and political cadres were trained by Chiang Ching-kuo in Jiangxi. Some of the cadres were selected from the Youth Army, and some were recruited from outside, and they had also completed their training."

Implementation of Higher Education and Career Change Separately

"The demobilization of the Youth Army was originally scheduled to be delayed for another year. However, because most of the Youth Army were middle school students and urgently needed to pursue higher education early, it seemed a pity to keep most of the young people in the army, wasting their study time. Therefore, it was decided to retire them early. With the exception of the 207th Division, all other youth divisions were demobilized. According to each person's wishes, those who wished to pursue higher education would pursue higher education, those who wished to find employment would find employment, and those who wished to stay in the army would stay in the army. The detailed methods had been planned before the demobilization and have now begun to be implemented."

As for the transportation problem of demobilization, the entire Youth Army in the Southeast region is divided into two parts: the Marine Headquarters and the Yangtze River Headquarters. The ocean takes Shanghai as the first destination, and the Yangtze River takes Nanjing as the first destination.

### Du Yuesheng Expresses His Opinion on the Movement to Protect Rights in the Shipping Industry: Hopes That the Government and the Public Will Be Calm and Discuss a Win-Win Solution Together

Recently, the shipping industry in this city, upon hearing that the Supreme National Defense Council had decided to "temporarily open the navigation rights of Nanjing, Hankou, Wuhu, and Jiujiang for one year," believed that it was humiliating to the country and threatened the survival of the domestic shipping industry. They have expressed their opposition one after another, and the public sentiment is quite激昂激昂. To understand the truth of this case and the actual situation of our country's shipping industry, the reporter specially visited Mr. Du Yuesheng, a giant in industry and commerce. Mr. Du agreed to meet with the reporter, and the reporter asked the following questions:

(1) The newspaper reported yesterday that the Shipowners' Association held an emergency meeting yesterday. Was Mr. Du the chairman, and what was the result of the meeting? Mr. Du replied: "The reorganization of the Shipowners' Association has just been established recently. Although the board of directors elected me as the chairman, I have not yet agreed to take office due to my poor health and busy schedule. Now, because shipping colleagues and other shipping organizations have launched a movement to protect rights, several important directors of the Shipowners' Association came to my residence yesterday to discuss and urge me to take office as soon as possible. As I am sick in bed, I can only exchange simple opinions and have not held a formal meeting." (2) What is your opinion on this case? He replied: "The specific plan for our country's shipping industry has been discussed many times. This can be seen from President Chiang's book "China's Destiny," which specifically emphasized and mentioned that "a shipping plan of three million tons must be completed within ten years." It can be seen that maintaining the shipping industry is an established national policy, with common interests between officials and businessmen. The National Defense Council's decision to temporarily open the four places of Beijing, Tianjin, Xunyang, and Hanzhong for one year may have other painstaking efforts in the government, but the response felt by the shipping industry is indeed very significant. In my opinion, our country's economy is currently at a critical juncture, and I hope that the government and the public will be united, calm, and discuss a win-win solution together to overcome difficulties and gradually seek revitalization, rather than mutually blaming each other. I heard that President Song has returned to Shanghai. I hope that the shipping industry will elect representatives to directly present all kinds of difficulties to President Song and that President Song will humbly accept them."

### Obstacles on the Sea Surface: Drifting Mines and Sunken Ships

### Trademark Infringement Case: Wilson Loses the Lawsuit

According to the English-language "China Press" on June 6th, the Jiangsu Higher Court has affirmed the Shanghai District Court's judgment as reasonable in the Shanghai Williams Medicine Co.'s lawsuit against Wilson Pharmaceutical Factory for trademark infringement. The court found that the Chinese name used by the defendant, Wilson Pharmaceutical Factory (韦廉士药局), was indeed intentionally imitated from the plaintiff, Williams Medicine Co. In addition, the defendant was also guilty of counterfeiting the plaintiff's various trademarks, such as Williams Medicine Co.'s Red Pills and Red Cleansing Pills. Therefore, the defendant was ordered to stop manufacturing, selling, or distributing these counterfeit medicines, and ordered to recall all the counterfeit medicines on the market, remove and destroy the labels affixed to them that were similar to the genuine trademarks. It has been found that the above-mentioned counterfeit medicines were discovered after the Pearl Harbor incident. At that time, the British and American staff of the plaintiff's company were all in concentration camps. Therefore, Xu Zagong, Ling Xinde, Yang Jiaquan, and Xu Liangkun, former employees of the company, colluded with Wang Danqing, the company's printer, and Cheng Meisheng to initiate the manufacture of the above-mentioned counterfeit products. The lawyers representing the plaintiff yesterday were Almann and Li Zemin.

### Increased Tax Revenue in the City; Municipal Budget Expected to be Balanced

[Report from this newspaper] The reporter recently visited Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, to inquire about the current revenue and expenditure situation of the Municipal Government, and the measures for increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Director Gu was busy with official duties and delegated his secretary, Tang Xingyi, to meet with the reporter. Tang reported that the revenue and expenditure situation of the Municipal Government for last month had not yet been clearly accounted for, so details could not be provided. However, it was learned that the income from the urban area under the jurisdiction of the bureau last month was approximately 3 billion yuan. As for the balanced budget of the municipal finance, the summer housing tax for this year has begun to be collected according to the new rent rate (that is, residential rent has increased by 140 times compared to before, and business rent has increased by 180 times). Therefore, the increase in housing tax revenue is expected to compensate for a portion of the expenditure. In addition, the central government will transfer business tax, deed tax, land price tax, and other taxes to local financial institutions for collection from July 1st of this year. In the case of this city, the income from business tax alone is very large. Therefore, after this new tax source is transferred to the Finance Bureau for self-collection, it can be expected to increase the tax revenue of the Municipal Government. The city's financial budget will be more easily balanced.

### Sino-American Hospital Fully Equipped with American Equipment Starts Providing Medical Services Starting the Day After Tomorrow

(Reported by this newspaper) The Sino-American Hospital on Beijing Road, formerly the German-run Paulun Hospital, has recently been taken over by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. All equipment has been shipped from the United States, making it the most modern and well-equipped hospital in the city. The hospital is scheduled to begin providing medical services on the 12th of this month. The date of the official opening is still pending. As this hospital has always been one of the most prestigious hospitals in the city, its transformations are of great concern to the citizens. Therefore, the reporter paid a special visit yesterday to the hospital's president, Ding Boxiong. He was told that the hospital currently has 426 beds, but only 333 are currently available for use, including 110 first-class and second-class beds, and the rest are third-class beds. The Paulun Hospital equipment taken over by the hospital and the medical supplies shipped from the United States are all unpacked under the strict supervision of the responsible persons, and there is no possibility of leakage. However, it is true that some medicines were found to have broken glass bottles when unpacked, resulting in considerable losses. All kinds of medical equipment shipped from the United States this time are the latest models, and some are even never seen in Shanghai before. However, the American subsidy is limited to this one time only, and how to supplement it in the future depends entirely on our own efforts. The hospital is currently hiring experts in the United States. As for the doctors currently hired, there are 40 full-time doctors and more than 20 part-time doctors. Part-time doctors must be on duty at the hospital for at least three hours a day. The hospital's biggest difficulty now is the water and heating system. The water and heating pipes of the former Paulun Hospital have been completely dismantled by the enemy troops, so it is urgent to find another way to solve the problem. In the future, it is also planned to establish a medical school to make the hospital the "Peking Union Medical College" of Shanghai.

### Citywide Open Sports Meet Qingyuan Pinli Wins Men's and Women's Overall Championships Hot Weather and Strong Winds Affect Performance Crowd at Zhongzheng Park Was Unprecedented

The 35th Shanghai Citywide Open Sports Meet, organized by the Track and Field Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association, was held at Hongkou Zhongzheng Park starting at 9:00 AM yesterday. As this was the first citywide sports meet after the victory, thousands of spectators braved the heat to attend. The command platform was set up in Zhongzheng Park, which was quite magnificent. A health team aid station was set up next to the platform, and the Municipal Health Bureau and Tongde Hospital were responsible for the aid. The order of the meeting was maintained by the Boy Scouts of Shanghai North Middle School and Shenpei Middle School. The band of the refugee and orphan asylum played music. Mayor Wu and Director Gu personally attended, and the atmosphere was exceptionally enthusiastic.

Mayor Delivers Speech

At 9:00 AM, the ceremony began amidst the melodious music. All staff members and athletes circled the field for a week. Then the national flag was raised and the national anthem was sung. Director Gu (represented by Wang Zhengjun) gave the opening speech, and Secretary-General Shao Rugan reported. Honorary Chairman Mayor Wu gave a speech, encouraging the athletes.

After the ceremony, the group meeting began. Participants included Guoguang, Jiji, Yucai, Shaoxing Seven County Shanghai Middle School, and Chengzhong and other seven schools, with a total of more than 1,200 people, which was neat, beautiful, and added a lot of color to the meeting. At the same time, there were also acrobatic performances by Yucai Middle School and Shaoxing female students, which won applause from the audience.

Track and Field Begins

The track and field competition started at 10:00 AM. In addition to the preliminary rounds of various events, there were also five men's finals. In the 1,500-meter race, Dumb Lou Wen'ao finished first with a score of four minutes and thirty seconds. Chen Bingzhong won the 110-meter hurdles, and Zhang Banglun was second by a shoulder. Wang Xuewu dominated the discus throw, Song Ziqing won the shot put, and the veteran Zhang Jiaqing won the long jump.

There was a break at noon, and the competition continued at 2:00 PM. In the middle, the Shanghai National Arts Society and the Nanshi Sports Ground performed national arts. The program was personally hosted by instructor Liu Weisheng, and included bare hands, single-person, double-person, equipment, and stone lifting performances, which were very exciting.

There were sixteen men's and women's finals in the afternoon track and field program, and the competition was fierce. The competition situation is recorded as follows:

Women's Finals

In the women's 50-meter race, six people qualified. At the beginning of the race, Yuan Pinli had a light pace. At the 30-meter mark, she gritted her teeth and reached the finish line first. Lin Jianxiu was two meters behind, with a score of 8.3 seconds. Lin Jianxiu won the championships in the 100-meter and 200-meter events. Zhuang Mingyi won the high jump with an Eastern-style posture, and Yuan Pinli was second. In the eight-pound shot put, Zhuang Mingyi tried twice, but was not satisfied. Unexpectedly, in the third attempt, she won the first place with 8.03 meters, and Yuan Pinli was second.

In the men's race, six people qualified for the 100-meter final. Huang Rui started the fastest, and Tan Qing and Zhu Shafei were slower. At the 50-meter mark, Huang Rui led the pack. At the 80-meter mark, Tan Qing sped up his pace, surpassing Huang and reaching the finish line, with a score of 12.2 seconds. Huang Rui was one step behind, and won the second place. Zhu Shafei barely won the fourth place.

Middle Distance Race

In the middle distance 400-meter race, twelve people competed. At the sound of the gun, Shen Zhemin took the lead, and Zhang Zhiqing closely followed. After running half the distance, Tan Qing enlarged his pace, chasing out the rest. The late strength was comparable to Dai Shuguo on the day. Tan Qing first broke the finish line, with a time of 56.6 seconds.

In the 800-meter race, Wan Jinsheng waited before the start. Lin Canran chased closely. At the 400-meter mark, Lin Canran and Wan Jinsheng competed fiercely. Lin ultimately had sufficient strength and reached the finish line first. Yang Songgen surpassed Wan Jinsheng in the last ten meters, with a score of two minutes and thirteen seconds and eight.

High Jump Javelin

In the high jump, Zhang Banglun got 1.52 meters in the second jump. Wang Yuguang tried his best in the third jump and got 1.6670 meters, winning the championship, and Xi Baimingxing won the second place.

In the javelin, Wang Xuewu and Zhu Ziqing competed against each other, which caused them to lose a lot of competitive interest. Wang Xuewu threw it casually and got 52 meters without any effort. It is a pity that Wang had a cramp in his foot, otherwise it would not be difficult to break the 55-meter mark.

10,000-Meter Final

There were many long-distance running athletes participating in the 10,000-meter final, and the interest was strong. Jiang Xiangqing fired the gun, and they had to run 25 laps around the field. Dumb Lou Wen'ao took the lead, and Liu Guangfa followed closely. However, after the sixth lap, Liu could not support it and retreated. As a result, Dumb won the first place with a score of 36 minutes and 8.3 seconds. The second place was Liu Guangfa, who was about 600 meters behind.

The 100-meter final was the last program. Zhu Shafei led the way, but unfortunately he was surpassed by Tan Qing in the last 30 meters. Tan finally reached the finish line first with a score of 24.9 seconds, and Zhu was second.

Looking at yesterday's results, the performance was significantly affected due to the hot weather and strong winds, so there were no outstanding results. The men's 400-meter, javelin, long jump, and triple jump were still barely satisfactory.

Men's and Women's Championships

In the men's and women's overall scores, the men's champion was Tan Qing, who scored a total of 17 points. He won the first place in the three short-distance events, which was very rare. The runner-up was Wang Xuewu with 13 points, and the third place was Song Ziqing with 11 points. The women's champion was Yuan Pinli with 16 points, and Lin Jianfen and Zhuang Luyi were tied for the runner-up with 15 points each. It is noted that the men's champion Tan Qing, the runner-up Wang Xuewu, and the women's runner-up Lin Jianxiu are all athletes from the Youth Sixth Detachment. After the competition, the awards were presented by Shen Kunnan, Chairman of the Track and Field Committee. The men's champion received the Mayor Wu Silver Cup, the Education Director's pennant, the runner-up received the Wu Chairman Silver Cup, the Finance Director's pennant, and the third place received the Middle School pennant. The women's champion received the Mayor Wu Silver Cup, the Land Administration Director's silver shield, the Works Director's pennant. The two runners-up received the Commander Xuan's pennant, Cao Secretary's pennant, and the Shanghai Badge Factory Silver Cup. Finally, the Secretary-General gave a thank you speech. The event ended successfully at five o'clock.

### Hong Kong Expeditionary Force Reports Another Victory Eastern Stars Beat Western Allies Result Four to One Each Team Scores One Goal in the First Half Tense and Fierce Competition Stamina Determines Victory

The Hong Kong Expeditionary Football Eastern Stars team played against the best Westerners in Shanghai, the Western Allies, at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon under the hot sun. More fans than the first game came to watch, about 20,000 people, and the situation was even more enthusiastic. The referee was Zhang Le, the linesmen were Chen Jixiang and Fadafu. As a result, the first half was one to one, and the winner was not determined. In the second half, Zhang Jinhai scored, and Li Zhaorong scored twice, resulting in a four-to-one victory for the expeditionary force. The lineups of the two armies are recorded below:

Eastern Stars

Western Allies

Savin Xu Erz

Griffith Oliveira Tiefuni (off) Hanni Bo (on)

Pantun Mackey Tang Roberts Stoff Carol Lych Liao Chai (off) Remy Dee (on)

### Key to Yesterday's Victory and Defeat

Yesterday's competition was tense and exciting. The number of wins and losses was completely determined by stamina. In the first half, the Western Allies fought with all their strength, and the Eastern Stars were almost trapped, and they could not attack repeatedly. The fans were worried that the Eastern Stars' luck was not good. Bao Baozhong, a veteran, was powerful and saved countless dangerous balls. In the second half, the Western Allies were exhausted and lost another goal, and the whole army collapsed. The situation in the first and second halves was completely different. The Eastern Stars won because they were young and strong and had better stamina.

### No Victory or Defeat in the First Half

At 5:30, the whistle blew to start the game. The expeditionary force kicked off, Zhang Jinhai sent Feng Jingxiang, Jingxiang dribbled the ball quickly, and was blocked by Oliveira. The Western Allies counterattacked, and Huang Mao Roberts Stoff went deep into the penalty area. Hou Rongsheng came out to relieve the siege. In less than a minute, Deng Guangsen passed to the left, and Li Zhaorong shot in the air. The posture was excellent, and Qin Baozhong easily saved it. Mackey Tang Carol Lych attacked with two shots at the same time. Xu Jingcheng retreated to defend, and the Western Allies returned without success. At 20 minutes, Xiao Huangmao ran rampant and actually knocked on the door. Zhu Zhaoheng pounced to save, but only touched it with one hand. Fortunately, it hit the crossbar and was not poisoned. In the melee at 37 minutes, Remy Dee got support and went deep into the hinterland, opening the gate of Eastern Stars at six or seven yards, one to zero. The Western Allies took the lead. At this time, Hanni Bo replaced Tiefuni, and Eastern Stars took advantage of the opportunity. Zhang Jinhai immediately returned a goal, one to one, and the first half was not divided.

### Western Allies Collapse

After the break, the Eastern Stars adjusted their personnel. Liu Songsheng and Feng Kansheng successively joined Luo and Guo, the two midfielders. The Western Allies also replaced Lei Midei with Luo Rongyuan. After another conflict, the Western Allies gradually showed fatigue, and the guest army was strong. At 20 minutes, Feng Kunsheng kissed the ball in the vicinity of the penalty area. Mackey Tang took the penalty, and Xiao Huangmao's offside was not counted. After five minutes, Xu Jingcheng advanced in the middle, and Zhaorong sent Xiao Zhang. Jinhai raised his foot and slammed hard, and the enemy door opened, two to one. The Eastern Stars came from behind. At this time, the Western Allies could only parry and could not counterattack. At 30 minutes, Lao Feng knocked on the door, Savin was invincible, and blocked the ground. Jinhai took the opportunity to snatch, and Zhaorong did score, three to one, and the Eastern Stars won another city. In the last five minutes, Li Shunyou cut in from the left line. As soon as the ball landed, Zhaorong pressed a foot, unexpectedly, and the ball had entered the net from the upper right corner, four to one, and another one came. Before long, the statutory time ended, and the expeditionary force defeated the Western Allies with four to one.

### First Volleyball League Registration Extended for Ten Days

### A Humble Opinion on the Development of Cultural Enterprises in Shanghai

— Liu Xian (Part 1)

History tells us that since Shanghai opened as a port, it has been more than a hundred years, during which it has experienced many disturbances and wars, but it has been fortunate enough to be preserved and has not been devastated. Even in the case of the Sino-Japanese War and its expansion into the Pacific War, after eight long years, Shanghai's position was so important that it could have been destroyed. However, once the stubborn enemy surrendered, the situation turned from danger to safety, and the city remained unscathed. This is Shanghai's good fortune and the blessing of Shanghai's residents. Furthermore, because of the victory in the War of Resistance and the decline of Tokyo, Shanghai has leaped to become the largest metropolis in East Asia, standing in stark contrast to San Francisco across the Pacific.

It is said that Shanghai now has a population of four million (the results of the recent census have not yet been released, so it is difficult to obtain accurate figures), making it the sixth largest metropolis in the world. In the past, due to the concessions, commerce developed abnormally, the market was exceptionally prosperous, Chinese and foreigners lived together, and Westernization was very deep. It was truly "ten miles of foreign concessions, filled with imported horses and fragrant grass, tea houses and restaurants, green wine and red lanterns, theaters and dance halls, extravagant and intoxicating, singing and dancing until dawn, a city that never sleeps," providing the utmost enjoyment of material civilization. However, when it comes to cultural development, Shanghai is extremely poor and backward. Compared with a European or American city with a population of four million, there is a real world of difference.

"The past cannot be undone, but the future can be pursued." Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the concessions have been recovered, extraterritoriality has been abolished, and municipal administration is unified and autonomous, all kinds of excuses that previously hindered the city's cultural development have been swept away. We should now seize this precious opportunity, take a long-term view, learn from the past, and build a modern Shanghai, not only with material prosperity and commercial success, but also with a higher cultural level, increased citizen welfare, and a transformation of frivolous customs.

The scope of cultural undertakings is very broad. How should we start construction? I believe there should be an overall plan, a large amount of funding, a distinction between urgency and delay, and a time limit for implementation. The scope can include schools, especially universities, research institutes, libraries, museums, zoos, botanical gardens, observatories, art galleries, music halls, national opera houses, opera houses, literary and art centers, etc. Please allow me to elaborate.

(1) Schools

Shanghai has always had many schools, but because of the war and poor security in various places, people with some money have moved to Shanghai, causing a surge in Shanghai's population. The number of students has also increased proportionally. After the victory, the government was restored, and even more people came to Shanghai from the interior. The number of students coming to Shanghai with their families is also increasing day by day. However, the number of schools in Shanghai has not increased much. On the contrary, many schools have been closed down because of their relationship with the enemy and puppets. Therefore, whether it is elementary school, middle school, or university, the supply is insufficient, and there is a great problem of overcrowding. To solve the problem of youth being out of school, the municipal government should promptly establish more elementary and middle schools to meet the urgent need. As for universities, there were more than ten universities in Shanghai. During the War of Resistance, most of them moved inland or were destroyed. Private universities are not worth mentioning for the time being. The restoration of national universities is still pending. Furthermore, it is said that Jinan University, which was originally located in Shanghai, will be moved to Nanjing in the future, and Fudan University will be moved to Wuxi. In the future, only Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Business College, and Shanghai Conservatory of Music will remain. These schools are all of a specialized nature. In fact, Shanghai does not have a national university that is scientifically complete and grand in scale, like Central University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Sun Yat-sen University, or Wuhan University. Shanghai is the largest metropolis in China, with a population of four million. It is an international outlook and a center for cultural exchange. According to reason and logic, a top-level institution of higher learning should be established for "culture for the sake of culture and scholarship for the sake of scholarship" to meet the needs of the post-war era.

(2) Research Institutes

Research institutes are the source of culture and the highest peak of cultural standards. Every major city in Europe and the United States has many research institutions engaged in research in various academic fields. A metropolis like Shanghai, with its developed industry and commerce but backward science, has many scientific, industrial, municipal, or other local problems that need to be researched and solved. Although the Academia Sinica has several research institutes in Shanghai, most of them are engaged in geographical or humanistic research, and rarely study local problems. In order to solve many local problems or technical problems of industrial and commercial enterprises, the municipal government should establish many research institutes. Research institutes may seem to be consumption-oriented rather than production-oriented to the general public. However, what invention in the world, what thing that benefits life, does not come from research?

(3) Libraries

Libraries are treasure troves of knowledge. Although Shanghai has several libraries, and there is a municipal library, they are all too small in scale, with little funding. Furthermore, the municipal library is located in Jiangwan, which is too far from the city center, and transportation is inconvenient, making it difficult to fully utilize. I believe that Shanghai is so large and has such a large population that it should establish at least one large-scale library with hundreds of thousands of books, similar to the National Central Library or the Peking Library. In addition to ordinary reading, it should also be used for research. Furthermore, many branch libraries should be set up and distributed in the main areas of the city, like post offices, so that citizens can easily access books for reading. As for specialized libraries, they should be established as much as possible, so that books from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, can be found in Shanghai. Only with libraries can we study knowledge and contribute to culture.

(4) Museums

Like libraries, museums are also a major part of cultural undertakings. Shanghai still does not have a decent museum. When foreigners come to Shanghai and want to see Chinese cultural relics and art, there is simply no suitable place to visit. I advocate that a large-scale museum should be established in Shanghai as soon as possible. First, it can show the civilization of our country, and second, it can provide people with a place to visit and receive the benefits of social education. Various specialized museums should also be established, such as science museums, natural history museums, folk museums, hygiene museums, children's museums, etc., to promote social education and increase citizens' knowledge.

(5) Zoos

Every modern city has a zoo. A zoo is a living museum. With China's vast territory and diverse regions, and the variety of animal species, it is not difficult to find many rare species. Raising them together for citizens to visit and for experts to study is a very meaningful thing. Unfortunately, China is lagging behind in everything, and the government pays little attention. There are no zoos in major cities. Although animals have been raised in the Shanghai Confucian Temple, Zhaofeng Park, and French Park in the past, the facilities were too rudimentary, there were too few animals, and the breeding was not very effective. As a result, the lions and tigers died after being raised for a while. I think Shanghai should establish the most modern and scientific zoo, on a scale as large as the one in Hamburg, Germany. Experts should be hired to manage it. Don't let Kang-produced giant pandas, the rare treasures of the world, not be seen in Shanghai, but instead be raised in the zoo in New York, USA. This is truly a regrettable thing for the Chinese academic community, because we don't have a good zoo!

Shanghai is located on the coast, with many marine products. In addition to the zoo, a special aquarium should also be established, specializing in raising all kinds of beautiful aquatic animals, especially beautiful fish like angelfish. I suggest establishing a large-scale aquarium to raise aquatic animals. On the one hand, it has educational significance, and on the other hand, it can be used for enjoyment and has economic value. It is a worthwhile undertaking with multiple benefits. (To be continued)

### Divination

— Shi Jimei

——That dreamlike life did not evoke even a faint longing in me. But for the sake of these kind and lovely people, I am willing to remember this leisurely mood forever, to remember this elegant affair.——

Hanli's room always has a hazy, dreamlike atmosphere. Even in summer, she doesn't like to draw back the gauze on the windows and the curtains on the doors, let alone in late spring?

Therefore, the quiet courtyard and the drooping curtains are even more like a dreamscape in the lingering sunset.

Therefore, in Hanli's room, we always love to talk in our sleep, absurdly, childishly, fantasizing... but we never find it ridiculous, nor do we ever feel tired.

There were several books on the table, placed randomly, as if no one had organized them for days.

"Lazy child, let me tidy up for you!" Zhao Yin carefully arranged them one by one, picked up a thin, large magazine, and said, "Let me divine my fate."

She turned to a page with a beautiful picture of a young woman, with the famous lines by the poet Xia Zhi-lin underneath: "The bright moon decorates your window, you decorate people's dreams."

We all laughed.

"That's completely irrelevant." She threw the book away.

"You can say that again! It's a perfect answer, and only you deserve it." Hanli gave her a playful glance, then turned around and smiled softly, "Let me try too." She closed her eyes, solemn as could be, and reverently touched a book, a small brown book, murmuring, "Page thirty-six, line six;" then, she carefully read out each word: "I have not been indifferent, nor have I criticized, nor have I calculated..."

What an incredible sentence! No one reacted because everyone was pondering. I was the first to jump up and shout, "Heavens! How can it be so accurate?"

We thought about it again and realized it was very true.

I didn't expect this childish game to arouse people's interest, especially in Hanli. She told me, "You should try it too, it's this little book, it's very accurate."

I casually opened a page and blurted out, "I want the most unlucky number, the thirteenth line." Hanli read for me, "Ah, that is the fairy spring where longing and forgetting are left behind!"

Is it because I have too many memories? Yet who doesn't find the past worth cherishing?

I was speechless, and they felt that this answer was both like and unlike.

"It's my turn!" Yi Qing said. She picked up a finely made, thick book with a smile: "Page one hundred and four, line twelve."

However, when we went to look at the place she was pointing to, that page, that line, happened to have not a single word, only a punctuation mark: "?"

"It's not accurate, it's not accurate. You didn't offer incense, so the God Guan Yu won't answer your prayers." Hanli snatched the book and threw it heavily on the table.

The smile on Yi Qing's face gradually disappeared.

Thus we whiled away a quiet twilight of late spring, in that quiet room.

### Sketches from the Sculpture Studio

— Liu Shi

——The Origin of Sculpture

According to archaeologists and art historians, sculpture arose and developed earlier than painting. Whether this is true or not is debatable. In any case, in the earliest primitive times, sculpture and painting were inseparable. Therefore, we can call it the "undifferentiated era" or "mixed era" of sculpture and painting.

To explain the significance of the emergence of sculpture from the perspective of humanity's innate ability to create form: from a vertical perspective, as far back as the sculptures of primitive Greece and Egypt; from a horizontal perspective, as in the sculptures of the natives of Southeast Asia and Africa today, and even the clay crafts made by children that we see every day, it can be said that all of them originate from human instinct.

Human instinct is subconscious admiration and astonishment for the "quantity" and "volume" of objects.——As large as towering mountains, as small as apples and cherries, when people see or touch them, they unconsciously experience pleasure, goodwill, and astonished admiration. To satisfy themselves or to record the things they feel and the emotions of the moment, they take materials from the immediate surroundings, either molding clay into shapes, carving stones, or using writing and drawing as text... This is what is called human instinct. It is also the germination of the instinct for art in general.

As mentioned earlier: people are driven by their instinctive love for the "quantity" of objects, and sculpture arose. This primitive love then promotes people's desire to create form. On top of this innate instinct, external aesthetic stimuli are integrated. Thus, the so-called "art of sculpture" is formally produced. In other words, the art of sculpture is not only a part of human culture, but can also be said to be the oldest seed of human culture.

——Primitive Sculpture

When humanity was fighting against beasts in the primitive era, they used wisdom to overcome brute force. The stone sticks, stone axes, and stone knives created by wisdom can be said to be the sparks of the art of sculpture. Later, after thousands of years, in the so-called early Quaternary period, humans were forced by the times to take refuge in caves, still living by hunting, wearing animal skins, eating animal meat, burning animal oil, and using animal bones to make various small daily necessities. In their spare time, they carved patterns on these tools, mostly animal shapes using animal horns and bones. There are also many strange shapes, like musical symbols. Although their meaning cannot be deciphered, the knife work and images are extremely simple and interesting. In particular, the line carvings on the small knife handles made of deer antlers unearthed in Spain, France, and other places in recent years make people yearn for them. It seems to be telling us that human life is not only for simple "matter." We should entrust our spirit to something with longevity, so that we can always evoke sweet memories and dreamlike thoughts. This is human instinct, the difference between humans and beasts, and the essence of the art of sculpture.

Serial Novel

### Flying Together (15)

— Zhao Qingge

Then he should learn to walk, he told Liao Dong, a real man cannot always crawl under other people's crotches to live!

Liao Dong cannot be said to be unaffected by Bao Ling's enlightenment, but he is still young after all, and doesn't quite understand life. Although at twelve years old, he is almost as tall as the eighteen-year-old Bao Ling, his knowledge is inferior to Bao Ling's, so he doesn't quite understand Bao Ling's meaning. Sometimes when he cries, Bao Ling laughs at him, and he feels that Bao Ling is mocking him. Naturally, he trusts Bao Ling in what she says, for example, he studies very hard, and with his intelligence, he progresses very quickly. Because he is still a child after all, his sadness and melancholy are not very profound. So since Bao Ling came, he has gradually become happier and more lively! This may be the other side of his latent personality, and this side may be real; the pessimistic side is created by the human environment!

Since Bao Ling came, she has never angered the old lady. Old Liao often reminded the old lady intentionally or unintentionally, "You can't judge people by appearances, who would have thought that Master Mo's son would now be our bookkeeper?" Seeing that Old Liao treated Bao Ling differently, the old lady could not help but treat him a little better. But once, because Bao Ling and Liao Dong were reading books late at night, not sleeping for a long time, the old lady woke up and saw the lights were still bright in their room, so she couldn't help but shout.

"What do you do all day? Why don't you drop dead? It's not your oil you're burning, is it?"

Bao Ling wanted to answer her, "That's right, it's the old lady's oil you're burning, so the old lady feels the pain!" But Liao Dong wouldn't let him talk back either. Because Liao Dong knew how fierce the tigress was, if she got angry, she wouldn't dare do anything to Bao Ling, and Liao Dong's flesh would suffer! So from then on, they no longer openly read books with the lights on. And there was no free time during the day, so Liao Dong came up with a solution, he put the lamp under the bed, and they sat on the ground and worked hard as usual.

The old lady rarely had a smiling face, unless the business was particularly good that day, or her Liao Dong amused her. Because money was her first life; her son was her second life; all day long she was either counting accounts with her toes or trying to coax her precious darling to play. On others, she was stingy, but on her son, she was willing to spend! Naturally, she was not stingy with her husband and herself either, she was very considerate of her husband's daily life and very willing to satisfy her own enjoyment. But compared to her son, she was still a little less willing. In this way, the son was spoiled! Little Liao Dong had already developed into a complete soft-bodied animal type. The old lady did not feel that this was a mistake, and continued to instill the poison of spoiling!

### Monthly Arrivals Only 140,000 Tons; Coal for Factories a Problem; Fuel Control Committee to Hold Meeting to Discuss

[Report from This Newspaper] The coal supply for this city largely depends on the Fuel Control Committee, but coal dealers also receive a small portion for allocation and resale to civilians, though the amount is very small. It is heard that the coal industry is repeatedly requesting the Fuel Committee to handle all coal used for factory production and resell it to factories in order to maintain the livelihoods of coal industry workers. The Fuel Committee will hold a meeting to discuss this matter in the next two to three days. However, with considerable opposition from the industrial sector, it is feared that their wishes will not be fulfilled. Currently, the Fuel Control Committee can allocate about 30,000 tons of coal per month for factory use in this city. Among these, state-owned yarn factories, silk factories, and paper mills account for about half, while the remaining half consists of about 10,000 tons for various factories and about 5,000 tons for coal dealers. It is said that the price at which coal dealers receive their allocation can be reduced by 10,000 yuan. The allocation of coal for public utilities, such as trains, electricity, gas, and military-use ships for rehabilitation, requires 80,000 tons per month, and the price is naturally much lower than the aforementioned factory-use coal. According to news from various industrial trade associations, although the procedures for allocating coal by the Fuel Control Committee are not yet ideal, the goods belong to the factories themselves, and there are few malpractices in terms of quality and tonnage. Moreover, although the allocated price is slightly higher than that of coal dealers, the allocation is direct, and monopolization and control can still be prevented. If all coal is allocated and resold by coal dealers, it may not be so convenient. Regarding the bankruptcy situation in various places, it is heard that Kailuan currently produces 300,000 tons per month. Besides supplying railways like Beining and Jingsui and civilian use in its vicinity, 120,000 tons are shipped from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai each month. Jilong coal in Taiwan produces 100,000 tons per month, of which 20,000 tons can be shipped to Shanghai. The source of coal for this region comes from here. All coal used by power plants along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines must also rely on the Shanghai Coal Committee. In addition, the Huainan mine can produce 30,000 tons per month. Except for 10,000 tons needed locally, 20,000 tons are transported to Nanjing. All public-use coal for the Nanjing to Hankou area is taken from here. The Huadong mine can produce about 25,000 tons of coal per month, which must be supplied to the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, and cannot be supplied to Shanghai.

### Rice Prices Recovered Last Week; Securities Transactions All Up; Gold Prices Stable, US Dollars Busy

Last week, the spot gold trend was fairly stable. Due to the preparation for the reopening of the securities exchange, the stock market was buoyant and thriving. Government bonds were actively traded by both bulls and bears, with prices fluctuating rapidly. Importers of US dollars aggressively bought from the black market, causing prices to rise. Foreign stocks initially rose but then weakened. Rice prices were consistently weak, but a slight turnaround was seen on Saturday. The situation in each sector is described below.

Spot Gold: In the spot gold black market last week, trading opened at 1.79 million yuan. Due to tight credit and many selling to exit their positions, it fell to a low of 1.76 million yuan this week. On Tuesday, it hovered around 1.80 million yuan. On Wednesday, as gold prices in other cities rose, actual sales increased sharply, and the market became firm. Although there was peace news on Friday, some people still viewed gold and banknotes favorably and bought at low prices. Moreover, the rise in US dollars indirectly boosted buying interest, and it once rose to 1.87 million yuan, the highest price this week. The closing price on Saturday was 1.84 million yuan, an increase of 45,000 yuan compared to last weekend.

Foreign Currency: The US dollar fluctuated with gold prices. On Monday, the market was mediocre, and a low price of 2.320 yuan was seen, the lowest price this week. From Tuesday to Thursday, it hovered between 2.330 and 2.340 yuan. On Friday, after foreign exchange experienced restrictions, settlements became frequent, and it rose to 2.500 yuan. Saturday's price of 2.520 yuan was the highest this week. The closing price on Saturday was 2.470 yuan, an increase of 140 yuan compared to last weekend.

Chinese Stocks: Although there was news of the resumption of securities trading at the beginning of the week, it re-entered a weak phase due to the tightening of credit. Because it was the Dragon Boat Festival on Tuesday, the market was very quiet. Unpopular stocks suddenly gained favor due to the impending resumption of securities trading, and all rose. On Wednesday, after the festival, credit gradually eased, and unpopular stocks such as Xinnuo Yarn Factory, Dazhong Zhang Match Factory, and Zhongkuang Yarn Factory continued to rise due to rumors of capital increases and bonus shares. Popular stocks also revolved and trended higher. Because of short covering at the close, they became even stronger. On Thursday, the two major popular stocks had already been bid up high, and the upward momentum slowed. The three minor popular stocks absorbed more and rose more. Unpopular stocks also increased in price. At the close, many selling to take profits, resulting in a slight decline. In the end, the entire market squeezed shorts. On Friday, popular stocks were initially stable, and unpopular stocks continued to be strong. Later, many sold to take profits, and all declined. On Saturday, the range of ups and downs throughout the day was extremely narrow, and trading was relatively thin. As a result, there were slight differences compared to yesterday.

Foreign Stocks: At the beginning of the week, the market was quite encouraged by rumors of the impending resumption of securities trading. Later, many sold at high prices, resulting in a slight decline. On Tuesday, the market was weak, trading was thin, and prices softened. On Wednesday, it initially showed a declining trend, but then many parties took the opportunity to be active and gradually rebounded. As a result, all saw increases except for Jardine Matheson. On Thursday, the opening was quite firm, but the market was suppressed by many competing to sell, and the closing was still stable. On Friday, it turned weak. On Saturday, the market was quiet, and all fell slightly compared to yesterday except for Ewo Brewery.

Rice: Last week, the source of rice increased, and the market gradually softened. From Monday to Friday, it fell all the way. Flour was also affected by rice prices and declined. Miscellaneous grains generally rose, but broad beans fell sharply. The supply of cooking oil was smooth, and prices continued to fall. The sugar market was stable, but medium sugar arrivals were strong and continued downstream. On Saturday, rice prices recovered after a continuous decline, and prices all rebounded. Flour and miscellaneous grains also became popular. Wheat and raw peanuts were weak. The cooking oil market turned firm, and sugar was stable.

Silk: This year's silkworm news is not good, and the cost of raising silkworms is high. The price of local silk rose instead of falling after the arrival of new silk. Therefore, Shanghai's thousand-strand silk was favored because of its low price. Last week, the price of thousand-strand silk also followed suit, rising by a total of more than 150,000 yuan. Factory silk remained stable during the week, with little change. High uniformity was also stable.

Artificial Silk: Last week, the asking price for 120 Denier Tianqiao Yuguang spot goods was generally between 1.3 million and 1.323 million yuan. The ups and downs of 120 Denier Beauty were around 1.18 million to 1.2 million yuan. The ups and downs of 75 Denier Golden Rooster Pingguang were generally between 1.38 million and 1.394 million yuan.

Silk Fabrics: The price is increasing day by day, because wages have increased, and costs have risen. Moreover, there is a shortage of spot goods, and the balance between supply and demand is lost. Therefore, prices have soared. American-made bedspreads are 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per hundred, Dacheng plaid fabrics are 600 to 700 yuan, and Sheng Hang goods are also rising.

Yarn: Last week, the initial opening was weak, but the situation was still stable, resulting in an abundant supply of chips on the market. However, the actual sales of major customer groups such as Tianjin and Guangdong did not develop much. Holders of long positions in 42-count Blue Phoenix, Water Moon, Baoguang, and other popular thin yarns were uneasy and panicked from time to time, and continuously sold at a discount in the market, and market prices declined day by day. In particular, the decline of 42-count was the most severe. The highest price of 42-count Blue Phoenix on Monday was 2.49 million yuan, and the lowest price of 10-count Great Wall on Friday was 810,000 yuan. The difference between the highest and lowest prices during the process was as much as 1.68 million yuan. In terms of count, the three brands of 42-count Baoguang, Blue Phoenix, and Water Moon fell sharply by 330,000 to 440,000 yuan compared to the previous week. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 160,000 yuan, 20-count Special Double Horse fell by 70,000 yuan, 16-count Guangming fell by 50,000 yuan, and 10-count Boy Scouts fell by only 20,000 yuan. This reporter pointed out in the previous week that the difference between the prices of coarse and fine yarns might be squeezed, and this has now been clarified.

Cloth Market: The trend during the week was still stable. Customer groups and stores had a unique demand for peach blossom girl, transportation map, and socialite Shilin cloth because of their low prices, so the situation was more popular. Prices increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan compared to the previous week. In addition, the market for various machine-made cloths was ordinary due to the impact of foreign goods, but it was better than the yarn market.

Cotton Market: During the week, Textile Construction Company and Yuxin and other factories were all watching and did not hear of purchases. In addition, private yarn factories such as Jiafeng, Sulun, Zhenxin, Minfeng, Qingfeng, Fuxin, and Lisheng all made sporadic purchases, so the market situation was stable. Prices increased by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Overseas New York American cotton futures and spot goods all rose by 28 to 35 points.

### The Calamity of Rosin

— Zhang Boan

Rosin is a product abundantly produced in the mountainous areas of our country. In the southeast, such as Lilong in Zhejiang, Wule in Lai, Xiqiu in Anhui, and Jianshao in Fujian, there are large quantities produced. Although there are no statistics, I believe the number is very large. During the war, rosin was one of the military supplies and was prohibited from being exported and isolated from the occupied areas. Therefore, beeswax and rosin are known as the "yellow tigers." During the war, some people inserted rosin and beeswax into the bellies of live pigs and flowed into the occupied areas to gain huge profits. This shows the importance of this item.

In recent years, the stagnation of rosin in mountainous areas is ubiquitous. In addition, forests have grown taller in the past eight years, and rosin production has also increased. When the author traveled through the mountainous areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui during the war, he saw countless mountain farmers storing rosin. At that time, many chemical engineering colleagues used rosin to manufacture liquid fuels, but the experimental results could only be used as diesel oil. As for volatile oils, because the carbon content and colloids were too heavy, the fuel would not burn completely once it entered the cylinder. As a result, the return valve often got stuck in the valve seat, and the pressure in the cylinder was very high, and the carbonaceous colloids on the valve seat were not easy to clean. However, the results were better in two-stroke diesel engines because there were no valves and it was a hot engine.

The author once used soft rosin and added 8% lime to make soap, which was dried to obtain fluorescent aromatic hydrocarbons. The fragrance was exactly the same as benzoin oil. The distillation rate of the oil reached 68% of the original rosin, the water content was 5%, and the remainder was the loss in soap making and coke. It can be seen that rosin distilled oil is indeed an important fragrance.

In terms of industrial use, rosin is mostly used for papermaking, a small amount for soap making, and the next is rosin products.

Rosin does not necessarily need to be refined for papermaking, but most other uses must be refined before it can be used. The operation of refining rosin is very simple. Although the equipment is simple or complex, the production is simple. Rosin is called raw rosin before it is refined, which is what people in the industry call "raw goods." Raw rosin is made in a copper distiller to distill out turpentine oil. The rosin is released from the still and becomes a transparent and clean block. American N rosin is the most transparent. The transparency of Wenzhou first-water rosin is not as good as N rosin. After the turpentine oil and some of the fusel oil are extracted, there are no problems in industrial applications. Raw rosin cannot be used in industry because one is that there are too many slag scraps, and the other is that it contains turpentine oil and fusel oil, so it must be distilled before it can be used. The refined rosin industry in Shanghai was not developed in the past, with only two or three small factories. Their products could still compete with foreign goods, because foreign goods were valuable. Although the quality of domestic goods was slightly worse, they could still be used, and the value difference was more than double. Therefore, foreign rosin has never been able to develop.

In terms of quality, the difference in refining technology is small. The biggest reason is entirely due to the poor harvesting method. According to research, if raw goods are harvested according to scientific methods and distilled immediately after harvesting, they can be as transparent and bright yellow as American N rosin. This is because of oxidation.

However, it is currently impossible for those who produce rosin in the mountainous areas of our country to harvest scientifically. Mountain farmers do not have enough capital to improve harvesting, and they cannot set up factories for manufacturing locally, so it is still difficult to improve quality.

Moreover, the market changes of rosin in Shanghai change several times a day, and it is difficult for mountain manufacturing to be flexible. If manufacturers go to the mountains to manufacture, mountain farmers will raise the price of their goods. If mountain merchants transport them to Shanghai for sale, they can manipulate the raw material prices. Therefore, rosin manufacturers would rather suspend production when they lack raw materials than purchase from the producing areas. The reason lies in this. Currently, rosin refining plants in Shanghai are operating in a very flexible way. On the one hand, they sell raw goods from mountain merchants to users and pay the user's money to the mountain merchants. In a blink of an eye, they can make a huge profit. Why bother going to the mountains to purchase?

The current price of raw rosin in Shanghai is 18,000 to 19,000 yuan per dan, and the price of refined rosin is 35,000 to 36,000 yuan per dan (the price of American N rosin is 95,000 yuan per dan, which is only 60% of the price of domestic rosin). If we compare the cost of mountain farmers with the profits of manufacturers, we can get the following results:

(1) Cost of mountain farmers: Daily harvesting of one dan of rosin, wages of 3,000 yuan, picking and mountain rent of 3,500 yuan, the purchase price in the producing area is 8,000 to 10,000 yuan per dan, mountain farmers barely earn the wage cost.

(2) Transportation from the producing area to Shanghai, the freight per dan is up to 15,000 yuan and a minimum of 10,000 yuan. Transportation merchants: The loss is 15,000 to 5,000 yuan per dan.

(3) Manufacturing manufacturers, the purchase price of raw materials is 20,000 yuan per dan, 3 to 5 pounds of turpentine oil are produced, 3,000 yuan per pound, and 90 jin of refined rosin is worth 31,500 yuan. In addition to wages and interest expenses, a gross profit of one to one and a half times can be obtained.

According to this, mountain farmers only earn wages, and give away rosin for nothing. Transportation merchants are unlucky and lose their capital. Manufacturers seem to be reaping the benefits, but they are not. First, a small rosin manufacturing plant, not counting its housing, etc., just the equipment cost alone, also costs tens of millions. Adding the cost of housing and so on, it costs a large amount of capital! Second, the rosin business is only for six months a year, and the other six months are spent eating the profits.

Our country's rosin production is so large, and its industrial use is so small. In fact, the only way is to improve quality and export it in large quantities.

Production and Construction Special Issue

### Provincial Governments Should Quickly Establish Entomology Bureaus

— Zhou Yao

The arduous eight-year war of resistance has ended. Scars are everywhere, and a hundred policies await implementation. Future work should prioritize post-war recovery and reconstruction. The wise see wisdom, and the benevolent see benevolence. People from all walks of life have discussed this extensively. I believe that agricultural recovery is the most urgent task. I will explain my reasons and welcome insightful critique.

(1) The recovered areas have been ravaged by the enemy for many years, exploited and plundered, leaving rural areas impoverished and production low, with empty treasuries. Even the provinces in the rear have suffered from droughts and insect infestations in recent years, resulting in poor autumn harvests and little surplus. Normally, our country's rice and wheat production is already insufficient at just over 20 million dan. Post-war food shortages are even more severe (news reports indicate widespread starvation, which is appalling). Importing foreign grain is merely a stopgap measure and a great shame for our ancient agricultural nation. Therefore, we must seek fundamental solutions to increase food production to plug the leaks and strengthen the foundation of our country. Preventing and controlling pests to reduce losses is the quickest and most effective fundamental method, as the saying goes, "Seven-tenths depends on insect control, and three-tenths on the seed."

In recent years, Henan has suffered from severe locust plagues, which have spread to Shaanxi. The full extent of the damage is still unknown. In the past, control was impossible due to the proximity of the front lines. It is likely that many eggs were laid, which is a major concern. If locusts ravage again this year, it will inevitably lead to complete crop failure. A major disaster will lead to widespread poverty. Other provinces and cities that have suffered from insect infestations will likely face similar situations. Prevention is essential, and establishing an entomology bureau is extremely urgent.

(2) Chinese farmers primarily consume grains, with very few vegetables and fruits. Grains lack essential iron and vitamins, leading to poor health and development. The nutrition of the people was even worse during the war. In the future, we must improve national nutrition and living standards. In addition to staple grains, we must increase the production of supplementary foods such as vegetables and fruits. However, horticultural plants like vegetables and fruits are extremely vulnerable to insect damage. Therefore, preventing and controlling pests is the primary task for increasing production.

(3) Cotton is a major agricultural product, but our country is still unable to achieve self-sufficiency. Before the war, we imported over 10 million dan annually, while losses due to insect pests were about 9.4 million dan per year. It is shameful for an agricultural country to rely on other nations for its clothing needs. Furthermore, cotton is a raw material for gunpowder and is critical for national defense. Victory in war depends on peacetime preparations. Therefore, all countries in the world, in addition to strengthening their military and weapons, make every effort to prepare materials. How should our country pay attention to the prevention and control of cotton pests to increase cotton production in the future?

(4) Silk, tea, and tung oil have been our country's major exports for many years, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. At the beginning of national reconstruction, the population and resources are greater than in the past. Exports must be doubled to offset the increase in imports. Therefore, it is imperative to increase the production of silk, tea, and tung oil. The government has recently paid attention to this, as evidenced by the establishment of the China Silk Company. Its intention is good, no doubt. However, its implementation plan has not yet been heard. The most critical issue is how to reduce the production costs of raw silk, tea, and tung oil. Solving this problem requires improving production technology and controlling insect pests.

(5) After the war, there will inevitably be plagues. History, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, shows this to be true. The war has caused countless casualties. The number of compatriots killed or injured on the front lines and in the rear has reached 20 million. Millions of enemy soldiers have died on our land. Bloodshed is everywhere, and corpses litter the ground. The outbreak of epidemics is foreseeable, and their transmission is largely due to insects as vectors. Therefore, killing mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and other insects to prevent the spread of epidemics is absolutely necessary.

(6) Post-war transportation will prioritize airplanes. Distances of thousands of miles will be as close as neighbors, reached in an instant. The import of plant seedlings and seeds from foreign countries or other provinces will be extremely easy. At the same time, the chances of introducing foreign or other provincial pests will also be high. In their native habitats, pests are controlled by natural enemies, so their harm is not obvious. Once they reach a new environment without natural enemies, they will inevitably cause enormous disasters. Therefore, customs posts throughout the country must have dedicated personnel to conduct inspections and devise countermeasures.

(7) After military demobilization, it is inevitable that soldiers will be moved to cultivate wasteland. However, the wasteland is overgrown with weeds and teeming with insects. Once these are cleared, the insects will be forced to starve. They will then attack the crops in the reclaimed areas. Due to the disruption of "natural balance," pest problems will arise. Therefore, pest problems in border provinces should be given equal importance as land reclamation.

(8) In the past, our country purchased most insecticides and pest control equipment from foreign countries, which was also a drain on our resources. In fact, many plants with insecticidal properties and indigenous pest control methods are quite effective throughout the country. However, these all require specialists to conduct scientific experiments and research, to improve and promote them. At the very least, we should use them to control various beneficial insects that control pests. These also need to be studied and utilized. In recent years, new foreign insecticides, such as DDT, have been constantly emerging. We must intensify our research and catch up quickly.

In summary, post-war reconstruction includes important measures such as increasing the production of food, supplementary foods, clothing raw materials, recovering foreign exchange, ensuring the safety and promoting the health of the people, and raising the international academic standing. All of these are related to entomological research and the establishment of entomology bureaus. It is hoped that administrative offices in various provinces and prominent figures will pay attention to this and quickly establish entomology bureaus to benefit the common people.

### The Meaning of Standardization

— Yang Yang

Some attribute the successful conclusion of this war to the massive material support from the United States, which rightfully earned the reputation of being the "world's arsenal." If we consider that before the Pearl Harbor attack, American production was not even on par with Japan's, how could it assume the heavy responsibility of being the "world's arsenal" a few years later? Strictly speaking, we should attribute this to the promotion of standardization in the United States during peacetime. Of course, we cannot ignore other factors such as advanced technology, abundant raw materials, and sufficient equipment, but we believe that standardization is the fundamental and most important factor.

The Chinese standardization movement was promoted once by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing in the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943] during an exhibition of products from its affiliated factories and mines. At that time, it did not receive any significant response, and now it seems like "bygones."

Now, there is widespread discussion of industrialization in China. If we pay due attention to American production and the Soviet Union's first, second, and third five-year plans (the Soviet Union is now promoting its fourth five-year plan), our discussion of standardization is not meaningless.

Standardization is the adoption or establishment of rules or demonstrations to reduce actions related to things, that is, to prescribe standards to increase output and reduce production costs as the main methods.

Ordinary standardization can be divided into (1) product standardization, (2) raw material standardization, (3) tool standardization, (4) labor standardization, (5) action standardization, (6) process standardization. General specialized manufacturing is product standardization. The so-called raw material standardization does not necessarily require the use of the best raw materials, but rather the specific quality raw materials that meet special purposes. Once selected, they are designated as standard. Labor standardization is the center of labor management and manufacturing management. There are two basic methods: time study and motion study, which we are familiar with. However, mentioning time study and motion study often meets with opposition from workers. We can emulate the Soviet Union's first and second five-year plans, promoting the Stakhanovite movement, where workers consciously and automatically undertake their tasks. Because China does not yet have labor-capital antagonism, at most there are only a few illegal officials and unscrupulous merchants with improper and abnormal wealth. At the same time, Chinese industry is still in its infancy and needs to be nurtured. If we can make workers understand this, I believe cooperation is possible.

Prescribing standards usually involves the following three steps: First, study various methods and their effects (investigation), then transform complexity into simplicity and select the best method or sample (simplification), and finally prescribe the best method for permanent imitation (standardization).

Common objections to standardization include: (1) promoting worker mechanization, (2) destroying manufacturing secrets, (3) hindering industrial progress, and (4) crushing individuality and inventive interest. Based on the facts of today's production industry in the United States, the latter three reasons are untenable. But this is also [missing character] and there are ways to remedy this. At the same time, weighing the contribution of standardization on the one hand, and its advantages and disadvantages on the other, we can easily distinguish between them. Standardization contributes to production in the following ways: (1) facilitating mass production, (2) increasing productivity, (3) reducing production costs, (4) improving quality and increasing opportunities for improvement. For society: (1) reducing production costs, thereby reducing consumer living expenses and raising living standards, (2) reducing unemployment, increasing wages, eliminating industrial unrest and conflict, and reducing business fluctuations, enabling balanced economic development.

### Save the Poor Tea Farmers

— Shen Zhigang

Tea is one of China's special products. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has been traded with foreign countries and exchanged for horses with border regions, possessing immense value in military and political affairs. According to the customs statistics report of 1872, the export volume reached more than two million dan, totaling 44,795,166 taels of customs silver, almost monopolizing the entire world tea market. After 1920, it declined to 400,000 dan. The tragic state of the export of Chinese tea has reached an extreme point.

With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the first wartime industry control on June 7, 1938, to develop foreign trade. The market was concentrated in Hong Kong, so in 1938 and 1939, not only did the export volume exceed that of previous years by a large margin, but the market price of tea also increased significantly, and the lives of tea farmers improved. After 1940, the seaports were blockaded, and the lives of tea farmers were extremely difficult.

With the victory of the War of Resistance, everyone hoped that the export of Chinese tea would develop greatly. Tea farmers returned to their hometowns one after another to reorganize their tea gardens, and tea merchants also prepared to export.

Today, the tea season has arrived, but the market price of tea is deteriorating. According to the price report released by the Washington Price Bureau on April 2, Keemun black tea should not exceed 42 cents per pound, and green tea should not exceed 48 cents per pound. Converted into national currency, the highest price per dan is only about 90,000 yuan, and it must be delivered in New York.

But what is the cost of our tea farmers? Please see the cost of raw tea in the Pingshui tea area below:

Appendix

Cost Item Amount Explanation

Picking wages 20,000 Each dan of raw tea requires 400 catties of green leaves, each catty costs 50 yuan in wages.

Same as above

Initial processing wages 7,500 Each dan of raw tea requires 5 workers, each worker is paid 1,500 yuan.

Fuel and charcoal cost 2,400 Each dan of raw tea requires 400 catties of fuel and charcoal, each dan is calculated at 600 yuan.

Food cost 18,000 Each dan of raw tea requires 30 workers for picking and processing, each person is calculated at 600 yuan.

Oil lamp cost 1,200 Each dan of raw tea requires 2 catties of green oil, each catty is calculated at 600 yuan.

Miscellaneous labor cost 1,200 Each dan of raw tea from the place of origin to the tea hall and other miscellaneous labor adds up to one worker.

Management fee 12,000 On average, each two mu produces one dan of raw tea, requiring a total of ten workers for cultivation and weeding.

Each worker is calculated at 1,200 yuan.

Land rent fee 12,000 General tea farmers are tenants, producing one dan of raw tea with 1.5 given to the landlord.

Tool cost 80,000 yuan

Adding the costs of the tea factory's concentration, refining, packaging, transportation, and losses, the cost is at least more than 100,000 yuan per dan. How can export trade develop like this?

Earning foreign exchange to purchase national construction materials is an urgent policy for the future. But what is the reality now? Imports are more than exports. The poor tea farmers, the end is coming again. Wise authorities, quickly think of a way to save them, to develop trade with the tea farms. Otherwise, this time next year, I am afraid that tea farmers and tea merchants will disappear from this earth. "Tea is a unique product of our country" may become a historical name.

### Introduction to Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

The following issues need to be discussed in terms of production organizations: (1) factory buildings, (2) personnel, (3) raw materials, (4) manufacturing, (5) transportation. If these issues can be handled in accordance with scientific principles, the chances of success will increase.

(1) Factory Buildings

A. Factory Location

The situation of old factories: Many prosperous factories, upon careful investigation, seem to have not undergone detailed consideration. These factories are often started by one or two people, or even one person, near their homes. The scale at the beginning is very small, but after hard work and management, its scope gradually expands. In addition to the expenses required for daily life, the organizers put the money earned over the years into the business, and the factory buildings are gradually added. However, to meet the economic standards, the construction of factory buildings must adopt low-cost methods or materials. When their business develops rapidly, they can build new factory buildings, but sometimes because the old factory building is the place of origin, they are unwilling to demolish it, so they try to preserve it. These factory buildings, which are added at any time, are often unable to connect with each other because of different construction years and construction methods, which is very inconvenient for the progress of affairs. If it is designed and built completely new factory buildings, then there are many places that should be eliminated, but to preserve the inherent factory buildings, you have to compromise a little. So the only shortcoming of using old factory buildings is that the progress of affairs is not very convenient, and it will be difficult to implement scientific management.

New factory buildings: A person who can create a completely new factory building is relatively lucky, because he can be free from the limitations of customs and can design everything completely according to the needs of the time. However, he must pay extra attention to his work, because there is no old factory for reference, and everything belongs to creation.

Several issues that must be considered when choosing a location for building a factory

(1) The distance between raw materials and sales: The location of a factory is best able to make the distance from raw materials to transportation as short as possible. For example, a factory is located near a railway or waterway, making transportation very convenient, then it is extremely convenient for sales.

For example, for the sake of manufacturing convenience, the location of a canned food factory is best close to the production areas of raw materials such as vegetables, chickens, ducks, and fresh fruits. But it does not have to be close to the tin can manufacturing factory, because a tin can manufacturing factory often has to supply many canned food factories, and the transportation of tin cans is more convenient than vegetables, fresh fruits, chickens, ducks, fish, meat, etc. Because the location of the factory building is suitable, not only is it more convenient to purchase raw materials, but the money saved in a year is also very considerable.

Therefore, the most ideal thing is that the location of a factory building is very close to the raw materials and also very close to the place of transportation.

(2) Consideration of labor issues: It is impossible to establish a manufacturing factory without labor. Labor is the producer of the manufacturing factory. Therefore, when establishing a factory building, the source of labor is also worth considering. If it is a very large-scale manufacturing factory, then this problem is relatively easy to solve, because you can build a town yourself, so that the workers of the factory live in it, and at the same time, you can also hold many welfare undertakings for the workers. This method is very common in foreign countries, but very rare in China. The former Kangyuan Can Factory provided accommodation for workers and was very effective in accordance with the principles of scientific management.

If it is a manufacturing factory that is not very large in scale, then the source of labor is worth considering when selecting a location.

### A Departing Look from a Prominent Industrialist in Yunnan: Suggestions for Yunnan's Industrialization

— Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli

Kunming Air Dispatch from This Newspaper, May 22

The post-war repatriation wave has taken away Yunnan's wealth and its talent. During the War of Resistance, Yunnan was not only a concentration of wealth nationwide, but also a concentration of talent. The large amount of wealth made Yunnan increasingly prosperous, and the large number of talented people laid the foundation for Yunnan's current industrial construction. Although it has only been eight years, the effect has been extremely significant. People often feel fortunate for Yunnan. But from the beginning of repatriation to now, eight months of repatriation work has defeated the hard-earned achievements of the past eight years. Not only Yunnanese are saddened by this, but many people who participated in the construction of Yunnan also deeply regret it.

### Talent Outflow, Fleeing Capital

After the victory of the War of Resistance, people from other provinces living in Yunnan returned to their hometowns one after another, and part of the capital naturally transferred with them. This matter is beyond reproach. However, in recent months, floating capital from the province's industrial and commercial circles has also been transferred to various places in Beijing and Shanghai to seek high profits. As a result, the money market has become tighter day by day, and industry and commerce have become increasingly depressed. The magic hand of speculation has controlled half of the market, and the psychology of disappointment and waiting has filled the entire industrial sector. This is one of the biggest crises in the current construction.

At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, the value of gold, foreign currency, and cloth in the hands of speculators was discounted by a few points, but at least some people could still be called "rich in copper mountains" at that time. They even used the relationship between public opinion and popular opinion to loudly appeal for help every day. Looking at the situation, it seems like stranded fish that cannot last a day. At that time, apart from the Yunnan Branch of the Industrial Association, few people noticed the crisis of industrial expansion in Yunnan. Although the association repeatedly requested assistance to various factories and mines, the loans obtained were still very small. The simplest reason is that there are many speculators, and the cries for help are louder and more powerful. There are few people in the province who are doing practical work in the industrial and mining industry, and they lack confidence and perseverance. Therefore, when survival is at stake, they feel even more helpless.

Yunnan's provincial-run industrial and mining industries originally had two largest systems, one was the Yunnan Enterprise Bureau and the other was the Yunnan Economic Commission. In terms of wealth, it can be called the best in any province. In terms of organization, it is also extremely large. In terms of foundation, they are all equal opportunities. However, since the victory of the War of Resistance, the affiliated units have either been closed down one after another, or only a breath remains. The reason is mostly due to the lack of personnel. In the past six months, these one or two units have been undergoing reorganization and merging to establish the Yunnan People's Enterprise Company, hoping to unify and localize it. Under the principle of distinguishing between public and private, wealth can be maintained and developed. The law is good and the intention is beautiful, but it is still difficult to produce due to personnel relations.

During the War of Resistance, state-run industrial and mining industries in Yunnan were extremely prosperous for a time. The factories and mines under the National Resources Commission reached more than ten units, including the Central Machine Factory, the Central Electrical Equipment Factory, and the Central Radio Factory, all of which were very large in scale. If general speculative tycoons can transfer their assets as much as possible and develop the province's large and small industrial and mining industries with the determination to ask less about returns, it is a good opportunity that is hard to come by. In the past eight years, some people with foresight in the province have repeatedly called for this matter, but the effect has not been significant. After the victory of the War of Resistance, state-run factories and mines were either closed due to repatriation, or shrunk due to the inability to maintain them. Few remain to this day. This has lost a major boost to the province's future industrial construction.

During the War of Resistance, many industrial talents from all over the country were concentrated in this province. After the victory of the War of Resistance, repatriation and receiving work urgently needed to be carried out, so they left Yunnan one after another. This is also a major loss to the province's industrial construction intelligence. Of course, there is no shortage of outstanding people in the province's industrial circles, but it is deeply felt that there is not enough talent to engage in large-scale construction, or even maintain the foundation of the wartime period.

### Industrial Magnate Initiates Planning

The dispersal of talent, the flight of capital, the stagnation of provincial and private industrial and mining enterprises, and the relocation of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises – these facts, on the one hand, have exacerbated the difficulties in reviving Yunnan's industrial and mining sector, and on the other hand, have made us feel that the work of revival is urgently needed. The reporter has visited industrial magnates in this province for this matter, collected relevant information, and sought their insightful opinions. After more than two months, I finally learned about a portion of their detailed and practical preliminary recommendations. However, among the industrial construction projects in various provinces, those that have already started this planning work are still rare.

The Southern Branch of the National Industrial Association organized the "Yunnan Industrial Revitalization Planning Committee" three months ago, mutually electing Zhou Ren as chairman and Fang Gang as vice-chairman. The members included Lin Fengqi, Guo Zhu, Gui Naihuang, Zhu Jianfei, and Lian Zhongjing. The committee spent more than two months from collective discussions, soliciting opinions, collecting materials, to drafting the plan, finally completing the article "Suggestions for the Industrialization of Yunnan". It is now scheduled to be submitted to the central ministries and departments and relevant departments in this province this month, requesting their adoption and implementation. These seven drafters of the plan are all people from outside the province who have made significant contributions to Yunnan's industrial and mining construction during the Anti-Japanese War. They deeply understand Yunnan's economic environment and resources, recognize the possibility and necessity of Yunnan's industrialization, and have witnessed the development process of Yunnan's industrial and mining industry, from its inception to its growth to its decline, sharing both joy and anxiety. They love Yunnan and cherish the fruits they co-created with the people of Yunnan. The current work of revitalization is about to begin actively. Before leaving Yunnan, they never forgot the industrialization of Yunnan, hence the drafting of the above plan. Some say this is a parting glance, while others say it is an expression of effort, but in today's Great Rear Area, how many such glances are there?

Speaking of Yunnan's natural environment and economic resources, they are truly rare among all provinces in the country. The entire province of Yunnan has vast land, a mild climate, lush forests and livestock, and abundant mineral deposits. Its economic conditions can be described as naturally blessed. If people can give their best, resources are fully utilized, and land is fully developed, then in a few decades, it can rival the Northeast. Moreover, currently, the situation outside the customs is uncertain, the Central Plains are plagued by disasters, and along the Yangtze River and the coast, either the vitality has been greatly lost or the remnants of the aftermath of the disaster remain. There is no time to save people from iron and rescue them from disaster, let alone large-scale industrial construction. The development of industry and mining in Yunnan Province is not only less difficult, but also cannot be ignored in future national defense. Therefore, in the entire nation-building process, the industrial construction of Yunnan should be regarded as a major and urgent part.

Regarding the steps of Yunnan's industrialization, according to the suggestions of Zhou Ren, Fang Gang, Lin Fengqi, Zhu Jianfei, Guo Zhu, Gui Naihuang, and Lian Zhongjing, they are divided into the following four items:

### Transportation Construction Advances on Land and in the Air

(1) Aviation Construction: Before the railway can be fully utilized, make full use of existing airfields and build airfields with economic value in important areas to make air transport within the province accessible to all regions, so as to obtain important materials and construction equipment.

(2) Railway Construction: The goal should be to assist the development of the steel industry. The first step is to build the Kunming to Yipinglang main line, about 120 kilometers, with Anning as the center, the Yipinglang coal mine branch line, about 20 kilometers, the Lufeng to Dashanya iron mine branch line, about 15 kilometers, the Caopu to Anning Wangjiatang iron mine branch line, about 10 kilometers, and the Kebao Village coal mine branch line, about 25 kilometers. The second step is to lay important main lines and supplement coal and metal mine branch lines, completing the Xukun Railway, about 700 kilometers, the Shifo Railway, about 400 kilometers, the Yimen iron mine branch line, about 40 kilometers, and the Huize copper mine branch line, about 100 kilometers. The third step is to lay other important main lines and important mining area branch lines, including the Yunnan-Burma, Yunnan-Xikang, Yunnan-Guizhou, and Yunnan-Guangxi four lines, and important mining area branch lines along the main lines.

### Steel Construction Completed in Phases

The first step of railway construction is to build about 100 kilometers of main lines and 90 kilometers of branch lines. In addition to 8,500 steel rails, about 8,500 tons, which must be ordered from overseas, the remaining 35-pound light rails, about 3,200 tons, main frame steel sleepers, fishplates, buckles, etc., about 8,000 tons, can all be made locally. The second step is 1,100 kilometers of main lines and 140 kilometers of branch lines, requiring 100,000 tons of steel rails, 90,000 tons of auxiliary steel, and 50,000 tons of steel for transportation equipment and various industries, totaling about 250,000 tons of steel. First, start with an annual output of 5,000 tons, and gradually expand to an annual output of 70,000 tons, to be completed within five years. Then, use five years to complete the third step of railway construction. To meet the above needs, in terms of steel, the existing steel plants and machinery should be reorganized and concentrated, and unified organization should be established to start production as soon as possible. In addition, it is necessary to add two 150-ton cupolas, five 10-ton Bessemer steelmaking converters, two 3-ton electric furnaces, two 6-ton electric furnaces, and one 1-ton high-frequency electric furnace. Expand coal and iron ore mining equipment. Build byproduct coking plants, refractory material plants, iron slag cement plants, large rail rolling mills, steelmaking workshops, steel plate and pipe plants, and iron car factories.

### Power Construction Plant Establishment Work

The major rivers in Yunnan Province have rapid currents, and there are places where hydropower can be developed everywhere. In order to cooperate with the construction of projects A and B and supply industries that can be developed as soon as possible, the order of power construction is as follows: (1) Langchuan Hydropower Plant: The river is about 94 kilometers long, with a water surface drop of 220 meters, and the water potential is 31,700 horsepower. If Dianchi Lake is used as a regulating reservoir, its water potential can be increased to 136,500 horsepower. Except for the Dazhuang section, which has been utilized by Yaolong Company for part of it, the downstream Caijiacun Shilouti section has a drop of 70 meters within 5 kilometers. Once Dianchi Lake is reorganized and regulated, the total power generation of this section can reach 30,000 kilowatts, so it can be developed in three parts. The first plant is located in Caijiacun, generating 6,000 kilowatts. The second plant is located in Shilouti, generating 20,000 kilowatts. The third plant is located 2 kilometers downstream of Shilouti, generating 4,000 kilowatts. Among the above power generation, 20,000 kilowatts are used for the steel industry, and 10,000 kilowatts are used for other industries. (2) Bapanjiang Waterfall: There is a large waterfall of 90 meters in that place. Within 1 kilometer from the large waterfall to the small waterfall, there is a drop of 120 meters, which can generate 8,000 kilowatts of electricity, and the project is extremely simple. If it forms an electrical grid with the Kunming plants, in addition to supplying power to Lunan, Xuanliang, and Chengjiang areas, it can also supplement the use of Kunming's industries. (3) Zhaotong Shaiyu River: Within 120 kilometers, there is a drop of 1,300 meters, among which the Shuiyan section has a drop of about 400 meters within 400 kilometers. The total power generation is about 30,000 kilowatts, and if a reservoir is built upstream, it may increase to 60,000 kilowatts. The power there can be transmitted to Zhaotong, Weining, and Huize, and that area is rich in coal, iron, copper, lead, and zinc. Relying on this power and cooperating with the transportation of the Xukun Railway, its economic value is very great. (2) Xier River power: From Heilongqiao in Xiaguan, flowing west less than 1 li, the flow is always rapid, and it is estimated that 20,000 kilowatts of electricity can be generated. In addition to supplying farmland irrigation to Fengyi, Binchuan, Eryuan, Dêngchuan, and Dali counties, it can also build the industrial center of western Yunnan.

### Other Industries Eight Departments

(1) Machine Industry: With the cooperation of steel and cheap hydropower in this province, the development of large and small machine industries can be achieved reasonably. (2) Fertilizer and Match Raw Material Industry: The special phosphorus ore produced in this province is of excellent quality and rich in reserves, which is rare in China, and can be developed and manufactured in large quantities for domestic fertilizer and match raw materials. (3) Aluminum Smelting Industry: Kunming and Anning areas are rich in aluminum ore, and with the cooperation of hydropower, it should be a very promising industry. (4) Glass Industry: Excellent glass raw materials are produced near Kunming, which can be produced on a large scale. (5) Textile Industry: The kapok in southern Yunnan Province is of excellent quality and easy to promote. Cotton areas in the province are distributed in more than 80 counties. If promotion is actively carried out and pests are controlled, it is not difficult to be self-sufficient. (6) Chemical Industry: This province is rich in saltpeter and sulfur raw materials, which can be used for the development of the acid and alkali industry. (7) Paper Industry: There are many primitive forests in this province. Once transportation is convenient, the wood pulp raw materials will be inexhaustible. (8) Various Mining Industries: The tin in Tongjiu Mengzi area is the first producing area in the country. Copper ore is widely distributed, and there are more than 80 counties that have produced copper. The distribution of silver, lead, zinc, and iron is in more than 60 counties, and the hope is so great that it can crown the country. This province is naturally blessed with coal and iron ore raw materials. Although the reserves are slightly inferior to those in the Northeast, the quality can be called superior, which is sufficient to supply the needs of the southwestern provinces. The important producing areas of gold ore are in the Jinsha River, Lancang River, Red River, and Nujiang River basins, all of which can be mined in large quantities. As for the asbestos in Wuding and the mica in Lijiang, they are both important special products of this province.

### Five Proposals To Promote Their Realization

Since the steps of Yunnan's industrialization are as described above, how to promote their realization? Here are five proposals:

(1) The government and the people should jointly organize a planning research committee to formulate an industrialization outline in the short term, and then draft specific implementation methods separately according to urgency and gradually implement them.

(2) For undertakings that are necessary for state-owned enterprises, the government should quickly organize them. Those that can be privately operated, or should be returned to private operation, should be actively encouraged by the government and vigorously guaranteed.

(3) A portion of the funds from the government's transportation development funds should be allocated to maintain the work of existing factories by placing orders.

(4) Implement a planned fund, which should be actively raised by the government through various methods such as fundraising, subsidies, loans, or issuing bonds, and strive to achieve results as soon as possible.

(5) In terms of tax revenue, the government should specially reduce or exempt import taxes, business taxes, and profit taxes for all private factories and mines that are handled in the industrialization plan, in order to show its advocacy, so that social idle funds can take the path of industry.

### Reader Opinions Guidelines

(1) This column is absolutely open, and the authors are responsible for their own articles, but brevity is essential. (2) Do not attack private individuals, and do not submit one manuscript to two publications. (3) Contributors must indicate "Reader Opinions Manuscript" and must provide their real name and address, but a pseudonym may be used when publishing. (4) Manuscripts for this column will not be paid. (5) The newspaper reserves the right to edit manuscripts. (6) Whether a manuscript is published or not will not be answered by letter. (7) The newspaper may forward manuscripts to relevant authorities for reference when necessary.

### Questions about Studying Abroad Exams

Dear Editor: At this time, when the leader indicates the beginning of nation-building and there is an urgent need to cultivate talent, I learned that our educational administrative authorities, because St. John's University has not yet been registered, do not allow our graduating students to register for the upcoming self-funded study abroad exam, which is shocking. I especially request a corner of your newspaper to state a few questions below, hoping that our educational authorities will explain them. (1) Many of our John's graduating students are government administrative officials, which shows that the government has actually recognized their academic status. Why doesn't the Ministry of Education recognize it? If the Ministry of Education does not recognize their academic status, then why not order them to stop operating, but still allow them to start school, causing innocent students to suffer? (2) A few months ago, the Ministry of Finance held an exam for senior financial personnel, and our John's students were also allowed to participate, and most were admitted, and now they are serving in various tax bureaus, which means that the Ministry of Finance has recognized their academic status. Why doesn't the Ministry of Education? (3) If the Ministry of Education wants to use this to make St. John's register, then the Ministry of Education can directly order the school authorities to comply. There is no need to sacrifice our innocent students. Moreover, our school is currently carrying out registration procedures. For the sake of cherishing youth, it should also be accommodated in theory. (4) Moreover, now that the Ministry of Education has adopted a self-funded study abroad management system, the purpose is to select real talents and eliminate unqualified people, so it is okay to allow them to participate in the exam, and the winners and losers will depend on their results. Moreover, in order to select real talents, the country has specially established a certification exam system for those who have no diploma but are determined to serve in public office. Moreover, our students have a diploma to prove their qualifications? Guangpei speaks above. June 3rd.
