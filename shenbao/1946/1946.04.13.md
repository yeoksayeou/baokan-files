[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Chongqing News: President Chiang will arrive in Nanjing around the 25th. The President's Office and official residence of the National Government have been prepared. It is said that at the beginning of this month, the President personally instructed Chen Xizeng, Director of the General Affairs Department of the National Government, to be mindful of the scarcity of materials, and to ensure that the arrangements for the official residence are merely clean and tidy. All window curtains and tablecloths should be purchased in gauze, and imported velvet and expensive silk should not be used.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] President Chiang returned to Chongqing by special plane from Guiyang at 4:00 PM on the 12th.

[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 12th] At 6:20 AM on the 12th, President Chiang observed the unique revival exercises in Guiyang City. These morning exercises are prescribed by Mayor Yang Jian, with one person from each household utilizing the idle time on the roads in the early morning to concentrate on performing the exercises in sections for 20 minutes. During his inspection, the President expressed great interest in them. At 10:00 AM, he held a tea party at Jianyetang to entertain more than 200 Guizhou gentry, leaders from all walks of life, and heads of government agencies. In his speech, President Chiang briefly stated: "It has been a long time since I last saw you all. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the return to the capital is imminent. Guizhou Province has made great contributions to the War of Resistance, so I have taken the time to come to Guizhou to meet with all of you elders and people. The most gratifying thing is that opium has been eradicated in Guizhou, and the health of the people can be the same as in other provinces, which is very different from the situation eleven years ago, and is truly gratifying. Guizhou needs transportation, and the Guizhou railway will now be constructed by the Central Government. In addition, there are three things I hope that all the elders and people of the province will strive to achieve: (1) Develop public health to enhance the people's physical fitness. (2) Afforestation and tree planting, saying that 'ten years to grow a tree, a hundred years to nurture a person', hoping that when I come again in a year, I will see that all barren mountains have become forests. (3) Improve culture, especially the culture of the Miao people." The speech lasted for 18 minutes. Three representatives of the elders, women, and workers also expressed their opinions. The meeting adjourned at 11:35 AM.

[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 11th] At 9:00 AM on the 11th, Chairman Chiang inspected the 205th Division of the Youth Army at Maijiaqiao and delivered a personal address, first saying: "Since you young men responded to the call of this Chairman in January last year, and gathered under the banner of the National Revolutionary Army, receiving modern military training, it has been one year and four months. During this year and four months, this Chairman has never forgotten you young men, so before returning to the capital, I have come to Guiyang to inspect you, and take this opportunity to tell you about your future responsibilities and directions of effort." He continued: "The responsibility of the Youth Expeditionary Force is to implement the Three Principles of the People, complete the National Revolution, and build our China into a free, equal, and independent modern nation. Today, this Chairman has come to Guizhou to entrust this major responsibility to the shoulders of you young people. In the future, the success or failure of the revolution, the survival of the nation, and whether the Three Principles of the People can be implemented, all depend on whether you young men can be united in sincerity and harmony, obey orders, and strictly observe discipline. This Chairman constantly encourages himself, and will never be unworthy of being your commander and elder brother. At the same time, I also hope that all officers and soldiers will recognize the importance of their own responsibilities, set their goals, and resolve to share life and death, and share hardships. Everyone should encourage themselves to be an anonymous hero of the revolution, taking the implementation of the Three Principles of the People as their own responsibility, working together with one heart and one mind, and striving to complete the construction of our country. Only in this way can we be worthy of our Founding Father, and not betray our original intention of joining the army to serve the country."

### Broad Scope of Discussions in the United States, Marshall Departs for China to Assist Our Efforts in Achieving Political and Economic Stability

[US News Service, Washington, 12th] General Marshall, after consulting with President Truman, announced: He may leave the United States for China today. General Marshall held a half-hour consultation with Byrnes and President Truman. Marshall said: Their discussions covered a wide range of issues, including the problem of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) transporting supplies to China.

[Another Dispatch] President Truman stated at a press conference on the 11th: General Marshall will soon return to China, and the content of General Marshall's talks in Washington will be made public after his return to China. The President replied to a reporter's question, saying: The General's visit and talks were very constructive.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to authoritative sources today: General Marshall has convinced State Department officials that the United States needs to support China's reconstruction efforts with substantial funds. It is expected that the United States will loan China 500 million US dollars, mainly for the purpose of restoring the transportation system. US officials believe that the unity of China is crucial to promoting stability in Asia. The extreme efforts that the United States is currently making are reasonable, and it is equally important to provide China with substantial credit loans to promote its economic situation. Sources familiar with the matter believe that the decision on the above-mentioned loan indicates that President Truman, Secretary of State Byrnes, and Special Envoy Marshall are satisfied that the expansion of the Chinese government's organization is gradually becoming a reality.

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Marshall today departed from the United States again to China to carry out a major mission to help the suffering China achieve political unity and economic stability. According to official news received in Washington, Marshall's return to China will find the economic and political situation more serious than when he left China four weeks ago. For example: (1) The Executive Headquarters formed under Marshall's guidance is making smooth progress in mediating internal disputes in various parts of China, but in the chaotic Northeast, work has made no progress. (2) In the Northeast, the government and the Communist army are constantly fighting over which party should restore sovereignty. (3) This military situation is unsettling and has even more tragic economic consequences, as military blockades have been imposed everywhere, especially affecting disaster areas. (4) The major political parties in China, which have reached unity agreements with Marshall's assistance, are now accusing each other, and even President Chiang and Zhou Enlai have publicly accused each other of dishonesty. However, US government officials remain optimistic about the overall situation in China, believing that once the frank and unreserved Marshall returns to his post, the situation will change.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] The Chinese authorities here are now arranging housing for Marshall. President Chiang and government officials will come to Nanjing, so Marshall's peace mediation work will also be carried out in Nanjing in the future.

### Suzhou High Court Pronounced Death Sentence Yesterday, Traitor Chen Gongbo to be Executed, Deprived of Public Rights for Life and Property Confiscated

[Our Special Correspondent in Suzhou, 12th] At 4:13 PM on the 12th, the traitor Chen Gongbo quietly heard the declaration of "sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and property confiscated." In this late spring March in Suzhou, the flowers and plants are thriving, the little birds on the pines and cypresses outside the court are singing chirpingly, the sunlight is so warm, and the weather is so warm—the entire universe is immersed in the joy of "life." However, for Chen Gongbo, only a ruthless gallows is seen, approaching him step by step!

At exactly 4:00 PM, the first courtroom of the Suzhou High Court was crowded with audiences and reporters from various newspapers. Suddenly there was a commotion, and the masses of people outside the door made way for a horse-drawn carriage to arrive at the High Court under heavy guard. Chen Gongbo is here. He is still wearing the blue-gray serge robe he wore on the day of the trial, holding a black felt hat in his hand, walking calmly into the third waiting room. The people in the courtroom had just sat down, and the bailiff shouted "Court is in session," and everyone became nervous again. First came the Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, followed by the Chief Prosecutor Han 　, Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, Judge Lu Jiarui, and a clerk. The Presiding Judge said a word softly to the bailiff, and the bailiff walked out. In a moment, Chen Renbo followed him in. Under the strong mercury lamp, Chen Gongbo's expression seemed only tired. On the day of the trial, his eyes were still flashing with the fire of struggle, but today he already knew that everything was over. He was still holding that felt hat in his hand, and the black leather shoes were shiny—but who knows how many more days he can wear them!

The clerk stood up and said: "The case of traitor Chen Gongbo will be pronounced today." Chen Gongbo raised his head and listened quietly, without any panic, but he kept blinking his eyes, his lips were tightly closed, but he seemed to be chewing something, his body was motionless—had he ever had "any fluke thoughts"?

The Presiding Judge's voice: firm, earnest, and calm. He stood firmly reading the main text of the judgment. After the Presiding Judge read the main text, Chen Gongbo was still motionless, but he seemed to be swallowing something, his Adam's apple moving up and down so violently. A pretty female reporter ran over to take a picture of him. Chen Gongbo didn't seem to see it. Can he really face death calmly? Or is he "unafraid of the law"? (The picture shows the expression of the traitor Chen Gongbo after listening to the verdict.)

### Traitor Chen Said He Would No Longer Argue Against the Judgment

The Presiding Judge's face was frosty, and he read the reasons for the judgment aloud: As for the defendant's defense, it is nothing more than an attempt to reduce his guilt, which is not worth adopting. The defendant is ignorant of righteousness and willing to be the culprit, so he is sentenced to the extreme penalty to make an example. The Presiding Judge then said to him kindly: "The judgment can be sent. According to the regulations for the implementation of special criminal cases, this case should be sent to the Supreme Court for review regardless of whether the defendant objects or not, so it is the duty of this court to send it for review. If there is any defense, it can still be submitted, but if there is a statement of defense, it is best to send it within ten days."

Chen Gongbo listened quietly, still very calm. He said: "I have already said during the last trial that I will never argue." But Presiding Judge Sun told him that this was legally insufficient.

Chen Gongbo said: "Thanks to the court for allowing me to publish my statement of defense and confession. I have finished my heart's matter. I understand the position of the prosecutor, he has no choice. And the prosecutor has already expressed his words. I have failed politically, but I have not failed in personality."

He smiled and bowed to the court, and the bailiffs escorted him out. The time was 4:21 PM.

A young lady in the audience praised Chen Gongbo's hair for being combed beautifully, but I thought of the old days when robbers were shot, and the robbers often shouted: "Twenty years later, I will be a good man again!" So the applause thundered. Chen Gongbo's biggest problem in his life is to desperately try to win applause, so that he is exhausted and exhausted. Knowing that it is a dead end, he has to walk and talk again. He has been extremely "performing" this skill. Will he write a crooked poem of "Thoughts on Being Sentenced to Death" in a few days?

### Puyi to be Extradited Soon, Will be Escorted to Nanjing for Trial, Investigation of Traitor Zheng's Property Underway

### Full Text of the Judgment

Kiangsu High Court Criminal Judgment, Special Character No. 375, Year 35.

Prosecutor: This Court's Public Prosecutor.

Defendant: Chen Gongbo, male, age 55, native of Nanhai, Guangdong, residing at No. 64 Beiping Road, Nanjing.

Appointed Defense Counsel: Gao Rong, Public Defender of Wuxian County.

The aforementioned defendant, for the case of a traitor, having been prosecuted by this Court's Public Prosecutor, this Court's judgment is as follows:

Main Text

Chen Gongbo colluded with an enemy nation, plotted to resist his own country, and is sentenced to death, with permanent deprivation of civil rights.

All assets, except for a reasonable amount reserved for the necessary living expenses of family members, are to be confiscated.

Facts

Chen Gongbo was originally a member of the Kuomintang, and was a confidant of the traitor Wang Zhao-ming, successively holding important positions in the central government. In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the enemy forces advanced victoriously. Shanghai quickly fell, shaking the capital. The National Government decided on a long-term resistance and moved west to Chongqing, planning a counter-offensive. Unexpectedly, the traitor Wang Zhao-ming violated the established national policy and willingly accepted the utilization of Japan's Konoe Fumimaro, secretly making peace. Chen Gongbo followed Wang, participated in the conspiracy, and at the end of the 27th year (1938), at Wang's summons, secretly went from Chengdu to Hanoi, Vietnam, to continue discussing the peace movement. Wang drafted a telegram advocating peace, which was given to Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and others to take to Hong Kong for publication, in order to echo Konoe's three principles of peace, hoping to confuse the public and obstruct the Central Government's resistance plan. Subsequently, Wang went to Shanghai to negotiate a basic peace plan with the Japanese invaders, establishing a puppet regime. Chen Gongbo traveled between Hong Kong and Shanghai, participating in the matter throughout. After the negotiations reached a compromise, on the 30th day of March in the 29th year (1940), they jointly organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing. Wang appointed himself as the puppet chairman, while Chen Gongbo served as the president of the puppet Legislative Yuan. In May of the same year, under the guise of a puppet special envoy, he led a delegation to Japan to return courtesies. Later, he also served concurrently as the mayor of puppet Shanghai. Under the protection of the Japanese invaders, he openly usurped official titles, betraying the central government. On the 30th day of November of the same year, the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan was formally signed in Nanjing, and the Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo was issued at the same time, recognizing Manchukuo, in order to undermine the integrity of our country's territory. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he echoed the Japanese invaders and, on the 9th day of January of the 32nd year (1943), in the name of the puppet National Government, declared war on our allied nations, Great Britain and the United States, and concluded an alliance treaty with the Japanese invaders. Subsequently, under the guise of a puppet ambassador, he traveled to Japan. In March of the following year, Wang went to Japan for medical treatment, and Chen Gongbo acted as chairman of the puppet National Government and chairman of the puppet Military Affairs Commission. From then on, the military and political power of the puppet government was entirely in his hands. After Wang's death, he formally acted as the puppet chairman and concurrently served as the president of the puppet Executive Yuan. He also visited the enemy emperor in Japan in the capacity of a puppet head of state, expressing that he would continue Wang's will to live and die with the Japanese invaders in order to complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War. In August of the previous year (1945), because the Japanese invaders surrendered, he fled in fear of punishment and hid in Japan. The National Government telegraphed for his arrest and extradition back to the country, and he was transferred to this Court's Public Prosecutor for investigation and prosecution.

Reasons

The defendant in this case, together with the traitor Wang Zhao-ming, jointly organized the puppet National Government, successively holding various important puppet positions. After Wang's death, he succeeded to his position as the head, taking control of the puppet regime, seizing Nanjing, and issuing orders at will. He has confessed to these facts without denial. There are also records in the Gazette of the Puppet Legislative Yuan of the defendant presiding over meetings and handling Yuan affairs in the name of the puppet president, official documents issued by the defendant in the capacity of puppet mayor in the Shanghai Municipal Gazette, as well as the appointment letters seized in another case of the defendant, in his capacity as acting chairman of the puppet National Government, appointing Chu Yi as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province and the puppet Guangzhou Pacification Director, which can be used as evidence. Regarding how Wang Zhao-ming informed him of his plan to secretly make peace with the Japanese invaders before leaving Chongqing, inviting him to secretly go to Hanoi, Vietnam, to send a telegram advocating peace, in order to coordinate with the enemy Konoe Fumimaro's peace declaration. How he was summoned by Wang to Shanghai to negotiate the basic treaty of relations with the Japanese invaders. After the establishment of the puppet government, he went to Japan in the name of a puppet special envoy to return courtesies, and then issued the joint declaration of China and Japan, openly recognizing Manchukuo. And how, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, he declared war on Great Britain and the United States in the name of the puppet National Government, and signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. He repeatedly traveled to the east to visit the enemy chieftains, declaring that he would swear to live and die with them. His confession and testimony in this Court also stated these facts in detail. Combined with the "Record of the Puppet National Government Delegation's Visit to Japan to Return Courtesies" compiled and printed by the puppet Propaganda Department, "Collection of Chen Gongbo's Speeches during his Visit to Japan to Return Courtesies," "The Conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War," "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government" published by the Political Monthly Magazine, and the records in the "Shanghai Municipal Gazette" and the "Overseas News Clipping Book," all are consistent. Therefore, the defendant's collusion with the Japanese invaders, secretly making peace, establishing a puppet regime, and openly betraying the central government, are extremely obvious. He should be found guilty under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, of colluding with an enemy nation to plot resistance against his own country. As for the defendant's reasons for defense, they are divided into five points. (1) He said: "The party cannot be divided, and the country must be unified, so I did not approve of Wang's departure from Chongqing and the organization of the puppet government, and repeatedly advised against it to no avail. I only remained because the relationship was too deep, and I could not bear to leave abruptly." (2) He said: "I have always expressed opposition to the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan, and after repeated requests, it has been abolished, and I have also negotiated with the Japanese invaders to abolish Manchukuo." (3) He said: "Making peace with the Japanese invaders was to seek the realization of overall peace, so I have never had hostile actions towards the Chongqing government. Although the puppet government declared war on Great Britain and the United States, it did not actually send troops. The purpose was only to avoid the Japanese invaders looting resources." (4) He said: "The people in the occupied areas suffered great losses, and the puppet government provided rescue, and the national vitality was preserved to a considerable extent." (5) He said: "After the Japanese invaders surrendered, I maintained public order in Nanjing to await the National Army's takeover. Afterwards, I went to Japan to await orders, and it was not a flight." And so on. (Continued on page 2)

### UN Representatives Draft International Military Formation Plan to Prevent or Destroy Aggression; Staff Committee's Power is Extremely Great

[United Press, New York, 11th] More than two UN representatives are currently in the quiet environment of the uppermost suite of a hotel in midtown New York, drafting an international military formation plan. This international military force will become the world's most powerful force to prevent or, if necessary, destroy aggression. According to the UN Charter, the responsibility of the international military is to advise and assist the UN Security Council in dealing with various issues arising from the maintenance of world peace and security that require the use of force, and to assist the Security Council in handling the deployment and command of troops, and the adjustment and reduction of armaments. This international military, in order to implement the resolutions of the Security Council, may have full authority to use force if it deems that the use of diplomatic and economic sanctions or the severance of transportation and communications is still ineffective. It can be seen from this that the power of the Staff Committee in the future will be great. To implement its resolutions, the Security Council may use demonstrations, blockades, or dispatch UN land, sea, and air forces. The Staff Committee is composed of the Chiefs of Staff of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France as permanent members, and the other participating representatives are all senior military advisors from their respective countries' land, sea, and air forces. What is currently under discussion is how many troops and equipment the 51 member states will provide for the international military. Observers generally believe that the majority of the air and naval forces will be provided by the United States, while the Soviet Union will contribute the largest number of land forces. The committee is currently inviting the Security Council to review Article 43 of the UN Charter from a military perspective.

Truman said in his speech: Civilians around the world, as well as their leaders and government officials, all acknowledge that the survival of culture is largely due to him alone. Only history can give him a fair judgment. The loss suffered by the United States due to Roosevelt's death is indescribable. Internationally, President Roosevelt's goal was for our country to occupy the position of a good neighbor and to participate in world affairs with an active, intelligent, and constructive attitude. Our hope for the future of culture and life depends on the success of the United Nations. He not only recognized this truth but was determined to work to implement it and has put it into practice. His foreign policy was to adopt a fair, sympathetic, and firm attitude when dealing with other countries, while recognizing our responsibility to other countries' starving and homeless people. This policy also recognizes the sacred responsibility of this country to countries that have been devastated by fighting to the death against totalitarian politics. We are determined to devote our full efforts to these principles of international cooperation. We will work to make the United Nations a strong and dynamic institution and strive to find effective ways to alleviate suffering and treat all countries fairly. These principles are the foundation of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, and our current foreign policy is also based on these principles. The overall work after the global war is indeed very difficult, but in short, this work is to complete President Roosevelt's basic domestic and foreign policies. Due to changes in the situation, there may be some slight modifications, but the main principles remain fixed and unchanging. We are here today not only to commemorate the immortal spirit of Roosevelt but also to gain strength for the future because we are inspired by the humanism that was promoted by his achievements and inspired those achievements.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] President Truman, having been in office for a year as of Thursday, addressed the nation, saying: We are on the way to balancing the budget and are moving toward full peacetime production.

Editorial

### Spain and the United Nations

Since the United Nations Security Council convened in New York, it first encountered difficulties with the Iranian issue. Now, the Spanish issue will cause divergent opinions. It is truly a case of one wave subsiding only for another to rise. The Soviet representative initially stated that the Soviet Union had begun withdrawing its troops from Iran, and an agreement had been re-established between the two countries. However, the Iranian representative denied the Soviet Union's actions, not only failing to withdraw its complaint from the United Nations but also insisting on its position. The British and American representatives, in order to uphold international law and protect small countries, and to safeguard the authority of the United Nations organization, supported Iran. The Soviet representative staged a performance of requesting the floor at the meeting, and ultimately, the Soviet representative angrily withdrew from the meeting. The Security Council, in response to the evolving situation, granted a period for discussion. Precisely at this juncture, the Iranian situation has developed, becoming increasingly clear. The United Nations Security Council's handling of the Iranian issue has therefore attracted worldwide attention. However, just as the sudden storm of the Iranian issue was being discussed, another issue appeared before the United Nations Security Council: the issue concerning the situation in Spain.

According to a United Nations dispatch from New York on the 10th: The Polish representative, Mr. Rychinski, today petitioned the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Lie, requesting the Security Council to take action against the Spanish Franco government, on the grounds that Spain has threatened world peace and is sheltering fleeing Nazis and their assets, and that German scientists are planning new methods of warfare. Another dispatch from the Associated Press in New York on the 10th stated that Poland requested the United Nations organization to take action against the Spanish Franco government, and accused scientists hiding in Spain of potentially conducting research on atomic bombs and rockets under the protection of the Spanish government, which is sufficient to endanger international peace and security. This newspaper quoted a broadcast from New York on the 11th as stating: It was officially announced that Poland requested the United Nations Security Council to include the Spanish issue on the agenda. The United States expressed its support, but will likely continue to oppose the Security Council taking action against Franco. It can be seen that the Spanish issue, having been raised by Poland, will inevitably be discussed by the United Nations. As for what steps will be taken in the future and how the Spanish issue will evolve within the United Nations organization, there is no need to speculate at this time. However, there are several points to note regarding the presentation of the Spanish issue to this session of the Security Council:

First, the Spanish issue was raised by Poland to the Security Council, and Poland is in reality no different from a seat attached to the Soviet Union. Poland's raising of the Spanish issue to the Security Council, if not directly instructed by the Soviet Union, must have received its support. The issue was raised immediately after the United Nations dealt with the Iranian issue. During the handling of the Iranian issue, the firm attitude of Britain and the United States made the Soviet representative feel embarrassed. Now that the Iranian issue is becoming clear, we see the Spanish issue being raised, perhaps with the intention of placing Britain and the United States in the same embarrassing position as the Soviet Union had been. Originally, regarding the Spanish issue, there had been no action taken after Britain and the United States criticized Franco. Poland's raising of the Spanish issue within the United Nations organization is intended to force the United Nations to take action against Franco. However, the views of Britain, the United States, and other countries on the Spanish issue are not necessarily the same as those of the Soviet Union and Poland. Since the Spanish "People's Army" was destroyed by Franco and the political situation in Spain became stable, some countries have attempted to destroy Franco's regime with international pressure. However, while countries like Britain and the United States have no sympathy for the Franco regime, their methods differ. According to a dispatch from the Associated Press in Washington on the 11th, the French government's proposal to impose economic sanctions on the Franco government has been rejected by the United States. The reason for the rejection is roughly that American figures believe that imposing economic sanctions on Franco would only strengthen his position within the country. Therefore, the significance of raising the Spanish issue is somewhat the same as raising the Iranian issue to the Security Council, but the positions of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union are different, changing from initiative to defense, and from defense to initiative.

Second, the significance of the Spanish issue and the Iranian issue is different. The former is a domestic issue, while the latter is an international issue, involving treaty relations and the issue of stationing troops. Whether the Franco regime is supported by the Spanish people should be decided by the Spanish people themselves, according to the spirit of the Atlantic Charter. In particular, we Chinese people deeply resent Franco's retrogressive actions, his subservience to the Axis powers, and his recognition of the puppet regime that appeared within Chinese territory. Now that the Axis powers have collapsed, Spain's past crimes should be liquidated and punished. However, we must remember that hating Franco's crimes is one thing, and liquidating and punishing Franco's crimes is another. The liquidation and punishment of Franco's crimes must be carried out by the Spanish people themselves. If an attempt is made to destroy the Franco regime in Spain by external force, which is currently a force for stability, it will not only invite the resentment of the Spanish people, turning instead to strengthen the Franco regime, but it also has the appearance of interfering in internal affairs. This should not set a bad precedent in future international relations.

The United Nations organization is a newly born institution. Regardless of its inherent conditions, the safety and security of the future international order are tied to the actions of the United Nations organization. In the operation of the United Nations organization, things are in their infancy, lacking established rules. Therefore, there are so-called procedural issues in dealing with some international problems. However, if an issue is clearly a domestic issue and is still placed on the agenda, even if no action is taken, this itself is close to interfering in internal affairs. Whether this is in accordance with the spirit of the Atlantic Charter is worth noting. We must remember that the safety and security of the world depend on how the United Nations organization is used in the future. Therefore, the United Nations must not be negligent or make the wrong move in handling any issue!

### Verdict of the Supreme Court on the Traitor Chen Gongbo

(Continued from the First Page) Regarding the first point, it is verified that the defendant colluded with the Japanese invaders and betrayed the central government. If, as the defendant claims, he tried to dissuade them but to no avail, he should have weighed the importance of the matter at that time to decide whether to leave or stay. Instead, the defendant responded to Wang's summons, secretly went to Hanoi, issued a telegram advocating peace on his behalf, and then jointly organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing, taking on important positions. After Wang's death, he succeeded to his position and became the ringleader. On the 13th anniversary of the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, he broadcasted a statement declaring that he would inherit Wang's legacy and work closely with Japan and Manchukuo to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity. This broadcast speech is evidenced by a recording from the enemy country. This is enough to show that the defendant abandoned allegiance and chose treachery, acting irrationally and at the expense of everything, taking actions that would lose power and humiliate the country. Although he devoted his loyalty to Wang alone, he brought immense harm to the country and the nation. Moreover, the defendant, under the protection of the Japanese invaders, stole control of the southeast, which had already formed a division of the country. Furthermore, he organized the puppet Kuomintang and convened the Sixth National Congress, using it as a means of appeal. The so-called "The party cannot be divided, the country must be unified" is clearly self-contradictory. Regarding the second point, according to the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan, Japan had the right to station troops in Mongolia and northern China, and to station fleets in our territorial waters, as well as to implement economic cooperation, allowing the Japanese invaders to infringe on sovereignty and plunder resources. The defendant himself even knew that this was an unequal and harsh treaty. However, he echoed Wang, and the puppet Legislative Yuan, which he was in charge of, passed it, which would make our country subject to its restrictions and forever become a vassal of the Japanese invaders, sacrificing the country and the nation at all costs. Even if he expressed opposition beforehand and demanded its abolition afterward, he cannot evade responsibility with this. Moreover, although the Basic Treaty has been abolished, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was subsequently signed, forming an alliance with the enemy country, and the relationship became even closer. This ran counter to the central government's national policy of resistance and was detrimental to the country. Furthermore, the defendant first issued a joint declaration with Wang and the Japanese and Manchukuo, and then on February 26, 1945, broadcasted a celebration of the 13th anniversary of the establishment of Manchukuo. He consistently recognized the existence of Manchukuo. The impact of this was sufficient to undermine the integrity of our country's territory. Yet, he still argued that he had negotiated with the Japanese invaders to cancel Manchukuo, but who can believe this? Regarding the third point, the defendant's agreement with Wang and the Japanese invaders to make peace violated our national policy of resistance and betrayed the central government, setting up a separate puppet government. In the puppet Central Political Conference, it was resolved that "After the capital is returned, all internal and external political decrees and treaty agreements of Chongqing are invalid, all troops should immediately cease fighting and await orders, and all civil servants should report to Nanjing as soon as possible." This is evidenced by the records in the book "Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government." The resolution falsely claimed that "the capital has been returned" and denied the existence of the Chongqing government, clearly revealing its intention to eliminate the central government and attempt to replace it. The claim that there was never any hostile behavior toward the Chongqing government is self-defeating. Furthermore, according to our country's established policy, we were allied with the democratic front of Britain and the United States to resist the Axis powers of Germany and Japan. However, the defendant and Wang established a puppet regime and joined hands with the enemy country Japan, brazenly declaring war on our British and American allies. Their purpose was to rely on the Axis powers, destroy Britain and the United States, and isolate our central resistance, in order to achieve their treasonous plan, which is extremely obvious. The claim that this was to resist Japan's plundering of resources is also a deceptive excuse. Regarding the fourth point, the Japanese invaders, due to their inability to control the occupied areas, created puppet governments for their own use, in order to achieve their goals of using Chinese to control Chinese and using war to support war. After the defendant and Wang organized the puppet government, they catered to the wishes of the Japanese invaders. The malpractices they implemented in the occupied areas, such as plundering resources, issuing counterfeit currency, selling opium publicly, enslaving young people, and implementing village clearance and blockades, were all acts that harmed the country and the people. This can be seen from the documents of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government that were obtained by this court and the telegrams between the defendant and Chu Minyi that were seized in another case. All of the above were vicious plans from the Japanese invaders' political aggression, and their harmful effects were more than enough to destroy the country and the race. The defendant still claimed that he was rescuing the people and preserving their vitality, but in reality, it was quite the opposite. Regarding the fifth point, since the puppet government was a puppet institution, it lost its foundation after the Japanese invaders surrendered and was bound to disintegrate at the same time. At that time, Japanese surrendered generals Imai and Okamura were in Nanjing awaiting orders. Before the arrival of the National Army, they should still be responsible for maintaining local order in accordance with the surrender orders, and there was no need for the defendant to provide assistance. Moreover, the defendant only had a small number of remaining troops stationed in Nanjing, which was insignificant. Even if he had ordered his subordinates to maintain security together with the enemy army, it was only because he was in dire straits and had no choice but to submit. How can he hope to be forgiven for this? Furthermore, if the defendant was sincerely awaiting punishment, he should have awaited orders in Nanjing no matter what the circumstances, but instead, he hastily fled to Japan, which is nothing but fleeing from justice. In summary, all kinds of defenses are just excuses, hoping to reduce or avoid guilt, and are all inadmissible. The Japanese invaders had long harbored the conspiracy to annex our country. Since the September 18th Incident, they had occupied our four northeastern provinces and established the puppet Manchukuo. Then, they sent troops to Inner Mongolia and advanced into Pingjin, which led to the July 7th Incident. Our country, having endured enough, rose up to resist in order to ensure the survival of the nation. The entire country, from top to bottom, united to face the national crisis in order to win the final victory. The defendant, who was originally a key member of the central government, should have understood this deeply. However, due to the initial setbacks of our army in the early stages of the war, his will was shaken, and he then echoed Wang and willingly allowed himself to be used by the Japanese invaders. At a critical juncture when the situation was reversed, he secretly fled, sent a telegram advocating peace, and then organized a puppet government, betraying the central government. He also concluded an alliance with the Japanese invaders, brazenly declaring war on our British and American allies. He repeatedly undermined the national policy of resistance and aided the Japanese invaders' aggression, placing the country and the nation in a state of eternal doom. He was truly ignorant of the greater good and willingly became a chief culprit. There is no leniency under the law. He should be sentenced to death to serve as a warning. All of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated.

Based on the above conclusions, the judgment is made according to Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, the former paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Articles 1, 2 Paragraph 1 Item 1, 8 Paragraph 1, and 9 of the Punishment of Traitors Regulations, Article 1 of the Provisional Law for Aggravated Punishment of Criminal Offenses by Party Members, the former paragraph of Article 2 Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Articles 28, 64 Paragraph 1, 65 Paragraph 1, 57, and 37 Paragraph 1, as stated in the main text. This case was executed by Prosecutor Han Tao of this court in court. April 12, 35th year of the Republic of China.

### A Day Will Surely Come When You Can Spend Your Honeymoon on the Moon in a "Spaceship"

[Agence France-Presse, Paris Dispatch] French young scientist Ananoff has conducted various studies on a "moon trip". According to his announcement, the distance between the Earth and the Moon can be greatly shortened, and there will surely be a day when it will be possible to travel from Paris to the Moon and back in three and a half hours. Ananoff has created a special means of transportation called the "spaceship", which will be publicly exhibited in a Paris museum in the coming months. Because there is no air on the surface of the moon, passengers must bring their own air tanks. At the same time, when humans walk on the surface of the moon, because the moon's gravity is much weaker than the earth's gravity, if passengers do not tie heavy lead to their legs, they will involuntarily jump. However, Ananoff has already solved this difficulty in advance, and has also found a way to reduce the speed of the spaceship's landing, and designed a method for departing from the moon and returning to Earth. According to what he said to people, we will surely be able to travel to the moon for a weekend trip during our lifetime, and newlyweds can truly spend their "honeymoon trip". The invention of atomic energy and radar waves solves all difficulties, which is something that idealists like the British H.G. Wells could never have dreamed of, he said.

Happy to be Elected as a Councilwoman, but Sad to be Abandoned by Her Husband

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch] Japanese woman Michiko Yamazaki, who calls herself a feminist liberator, participated in the election and was elected as a member of the House of Representatives. Her husband, who had been separated for four years, returned from afar on the eve of the election, bringing with him a concubine and two sons. Yamazaki was very angry and sighed: "The joy of being elected as a member of the House of Representatives is far less than the sadness of being abandoned by my husband."

### Joking with Election Tickets

Writing "Give More Food"

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch] The counting of votes in various parts of Japan has not yet been completed. Twelve votes for MacArthur, one vote for President Truman, and another thirteen election tickets with the words "Give More Food" written on them have been found. All of the above votes are invalid.

Elementary School Teachers Strike to Demand Salaries

The teachers and staff of elementary and secondary schools in the urban and rural areas of this county have only received 7,500 yuan in legal tender per person since the victory last year. From the beginning of this semester, they have received nothing. It is difficult to continue working for the public on an empty stomach.

They used a large number of silk fabrics and silk to borrow cash from the joint office of the Sino-China Trust and Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and the Hangzhou branch of the Loan Committee. After the victory in the war, the Loan Committee of the Four Banks returned to Hangzhou to work, and the silk merchants also returned to Hangzhou to resume business. When they went to the committee to redeem their goods, the committee said that it was beyond human power to recover them, and all of them had been lost. The Loan Committee requested compensation for the collateral, estimated at 20 billion yuan at the current value. The Hangzhou District Court scheduled the hearing for the 12th.

### Solving the Housing Crisis: Specific Measures Stipulated; Executive Yuan Convenes Allocation Committee with Military and Political Organs, Prioritizing Rental to Returning Organs and Civil Servants

Yesterday afternoon, Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, met with Liu Gongyun, Director of the Enemy Property Administration, for a lengthy period. It is reported that the content of the discussion was related to resolving the housing difficulties of various organs and civil servants. It is confirmed that, in view of the extreme difficulty faced by personnel from various organs returning to Shanghai to find housing after the victory, and with the continuous repatriation of enemy aliens, the Executive Yuan has decided on a policy of disposing of enemy and puppet properties entirely, and taking into consideration the rights and interests of the original owners of the houses occupied by enemy aliens, as well as relieving the housing difficulties of various organs and civil servants. The following measures are specifically stipulated for the allocation of housing in Shanghai:

(1) Houses occupied by enemy aliens that are owned by enemies or puppets shall be taken over and sold by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration. The Shanghai Municipal Government shall be responsible for guarding them before the sale.

(2) For houses occupied by enemy aliens that are not owned by enemies or puppets, the property rights shall be investigated and returned to the original owners by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration.

(3) In order to meet the urgent needs of repatriation, the aforementioned houses shall be leased uniformly by the Central Trust Bureau for a term of one year. Tenants must sign a contract guaranteeing the monthly payment of the prescribed rent and agreeing to vacate upon expiration without renewal or transfer. Violators will be ordered to move out.

(4) The aforementioned houses shall be prioritized for rental to organs and civil servants returning to Shanghai. The Shanghai Organ Housing Allocation Committee organized by this Yuan shall review and allocate them, and submit them to this Yuan for record.

(5) Those who have not been approved to reside in the aforementioned houses shall be ordered to move out within a specified period.

(6) Organs or civil servants originally residing in enemy or puppet properties shall be ordered to move out within a specified period. Those who have been approved for rental or have a necessary reason to remain in Shanghai may pre-emptively allocate from the houses being leased.

(7) With regard to the aforementioned items 5 and 6, if the residents who are required to move out fail to do so after the deadline, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters shall enforce it. In addition, the Executive Yuan, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Third Front Army, and the Songhu Garrison Command, etc., have organized the Shanghai Organ Housing Allocation Committee, with Qian Dajun serving as the acting chairman, Peng Xuepei serving as the vice-chairman, and Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiqing, Li Jilan, Liu Gongyun, Huang Boji, Li Chongshi, Xuan Tiewu, Song Siyi, and Wang Guanghan serving as members. The committee will convene a meeting soon to coordinate housing allocation matters based on these measures.

Summoning Industry and Commerce Leaders to Discuss Wage Issues

[Our Newspaper] Executive Yuan President Song summoned leaders from the city’s industrial and commercial sectors on the 11th to discuss wage issues, with over twenty attendees including Wu Kaixian and Pan Gongzhan. During the meeting, some advocated for a minimum wage standard, while others preferred a maximum wage standard. Director Wu, however, believed that factory units should be the basis, as factories vary in size. Setting a minimum wage would make it difficult for small factories to sustain themselves. As a result, Premier Song instructed Director Wu to conduct a detailed investigation of wage conditions in various factories for further review.

### Yuan Meiyun: Opium Addiction; Unregistered; Taken Away by Officials

[Our Newspaper] Film star Yuan Meiyun is deeply addicted to opium. Yesterday morning at approximately 8:00 AM, the Changshu Road Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau sent officers to her residence to bring her in for questioning. According to Yuan's confession, she has been smoking opium for two years, is still currently smoking, and has not registered with the police. She was immediately transferred to the Criminal Police Division of the General Bureau and then to the court for handling. Furthermore, regarding joint liability for opium prohibition, according to the regulations on Baojia personnel assisting in opium prohibition, only the head of the household is responsible for the joint liability of opium addicts in their household. If the head of the household is an opium addict, they will be subject to legal punishment, and their family members are not jointly liable. Regarding Vice Mayor He’s explanation mentioned yesterday, concerning "family members, etc., must also be jointly liable," the Municipal Government has declared that Mr. He did not mention it, and it was a misunderstanding.

### Pan Sansheng, Wu Songgao: Families Hope to Communicate

[Our Newspaper] The former Puppet Judicial Administration Minister Wu Songgao and "Shanghai celebrity" Pan Sansheng were interrogated by the High Procuratorate yesterday morning. When the bailiffs escorted them from the prison to the courtroom, their family members rushed forward attempting to speak with them (as yesterday was the day for family members to deliver food), but they were stopped by the bailiffs. In addition to these two, those interrogated yesterday also included Liu Yusheng (cultural traitor), Liu Xingchen (Director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Goods Allocation Office), Dai Ailu (Manager of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch), Huang Xianggu, Jiang Shangda, Fan Yongzeng, Yan Jiaqi, Zou Baoshan, and Bu Shuhua, among others.

### Revised Standards for Calculating Rent: Commercial Buildings at 180 Times Pre-War Levels, Residential Buildings at 140 Times

During yesterday morning's municipal government meeting, it was resolved to revise the standards for calculating rent in this city. Residential buildings were revised to 140 times the rent in 1937, and commercial buildings were revised to 180 times. Property donations will be collected at the original rate of 14% based on 180 times, to be borne by the landlords, starting from April of this year.

### Rent Increase: Shanghai Real Estate Merchants Say Landlords Still Have No Profit

[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently inquired about the revised rent issue with real estate merchants in this city. It is understood that these merchants believe that the municipal government's measure is still a fair solution for the time being. The multiplier is also considered appropriate. Considering the exchange rate between legal tender and puppet Central Reserve Bank notes, the multiplier is not small. However, landlords still cannot discuss profits with the increased multiplier, at most only slightly supplementing the cost of managing the houses. In addition, property donations will also increase, plus 14% for the City Defense Corps uniform fee, stamp duty, and the upcoming rental income tax, land donations, etc., all of which must be deducted from the increased multiplier, so the actual gain is very limited. The cost of managing houses is enormous, especially insurance, which has increased to 2,000 times the pre-war amount, making it difficult for landlords to cope.

[Our Newspaper] It is reported that the Legislative Yuan has drafted a tax rate for rental income tax and is currently seeking opinions from the City Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association. It is said that those with an annual net rental income of over 10 million yuan will be taxed at 12%, and those with over 50 million yuan will be taxed at 18%.

### Northern Shipping Line Shipments

[Our Newspaper] British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire are assisting in the transportation of relief supplies by deploying more ships to the Northern Line. The "Nanchang" sailed to Qinhuangdao on the 10th, carrying 79,000 bags of relief flour. The "Hubei" sailed to Tianjin yesterday, the "Yongsheng" will sail to Qingdao today, and the "Shandong" is scheduled to sail to Tanggu next Monday, all with large quantities of relief supplies heading to North China. Furthermore, on the international route, the American President Lines' "Seal" is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai to return to New York tomorrow. The "Grant President" is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong via Manila on the 16th and depart for the United States on the 17th, reportedly carrying a large quantity of pig bristles to the United States. In addition, the famous "Changxing" steamship company's "Empress" mail ship, which operates on the Pacific Line, suffered damage during the war when its ships assisted in military transport. The company's Shanghai branch is now preparing and scheduled to reopen on the 15th of this month. The date of the "Empress" mail ship's arrival is still uncertain.

### Motor and Silk Weaving Industry Labor Dispute: Municipal Government's Handling Measures

[Our Newspaper] In the motor and silk weaving industry labor dispute in this city, the labor side demands a base salary of 2.2 yuan, while the management offers 1.2 yuan. Both sides have requested the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee to arbitrate. It is reported that the municipal government has now decided that any base salary adjustments before the 12th of this month will not be counted, and no base salary increases will be allowed thereafter. Wages will continue to be implemented according to the cost of living index. Therefore, the motor and silk weaving industry labor dispute will also be handled according to this method.

### Traffic Accidents: Nine Injured in Three Locations

### China is the Most Heavily Affected; Starving People are Everywhere: UNRRA Director's Representative Mooney Issues Statement After Inspecting Disaster Conditions

[Our Newspaper] Mooney, the representative of the Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was ordered in late February to come to China to inspect the relief and rehabilitation work in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Qingdao, Hebei, Rehe, Peiping, Tianjin, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and various other areas in order to report to the Washington Headquarters. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, he held a press conference at the Riverside Mansion, accompanied by Caesar, the UNRRA Director for China, to answer questions. Mooney made the following statement:

China has suffered the most from eight years of bitter fighting. Hundreds of cities have been severely damaged, and millions of refugees have been displaced, unable to return home. The suffering of hunger, cold, poverty, and disease is unbearable. The number of people dying from hunger and disease is already quite alarming. UNRRA has entrusted the China Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to expedite the transportation of food and other supplies for relief. However, transportation is extremely difficult due to poor transportation, especially in Central China. In areas where land and water transportation cannot transport materials, air transport is planned. UNRRA's own supply of rice and wheat is also very limited, with US$675,000,000 already shipped to China. In order to relieve its millions of starving people, China cannot rely entirely on imported food. At this critical moment, China can still find ways to compensate, namely: (1) Some areas and some Communist-controlled areas still have surplus food, which should be distributed as much as possible. (2) Some restaurants and guesthouses in cities can be reduced, and upper-middle-class families can often try to save on meals. UNRRA materials are entirely for relieving those in need. In China, there are two aspects to this project: relief and construction, and the cost of construction is much greater than that of relief.

Before coming to China, I had heard various criticisms about the China Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, so I came here to inspect from many aspects. The administration has made mistakes in the past, but we are also not immune. As with the establishment of any new organization, the administration has inevitably encountered various difficulties, but the work is now making great progress. Two months ago, a large number of materials were piled up on the Shanghai docks, but were not transported. Today, they have been transported in large quantities to the interior, undergoing difficult transportation through more than a dozen dangerous and narrow roads. I am quite satisfied.

Mooney also answered reporters' questions, stating that relief supplies have been transported to communist-controlled areas, but transportation is very difficult. The materials are first transported to Peiping, then through the Great Wall and other places, from the last location controlled by the Chinese Central Government to the front lines of the communist-controlled areas, which is also a very complicated process.

UNRRA has shipped 200,000 tons of food to China. The provinces most in need of food are Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi.

Relief and Repair of Damaged Houses

(Another Report) The damage to houses in the recovered areas is extremely serious, especially in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, and Guangxi provinces. The administration has decided in principle to first assist in the repair of cities with more than 50% damage, but only public buildings such as hospitals, kindergartens, primary schools, markets, and important charitable organizations. Private repair or reconstruction of houses is not planned to be subsidized. The various reports in a news release on the 10th from a certain news agency are not factual.

### Commander-in-Chief He Inspects Military Supply Warehouses; Rumor Says He Will Coordinate Distribution to Replenish National Army

Commander-in-Chief He, accompanied by Commander Tang and his entourage, departed from Nanjing on the 10th to inspect garrisons and warehouses along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, arriving in Shanghai by special train around 7:00 PM the night before. Yesterday, He spent the entire day in Jiangwan and Yangshupu, inspecting the military supply warehouses received by the Ministry of Military Affairs. It is said that he will continue the inspection today. There are also rumors of a meeting to address the complete disposition of the military supplies and materials that have been received for half a year, in order to coordinate the replenishment of equipment and supplies to our various units. According to reports, the Ministry of Military Affairs has received dozens of warehouses in this city, and the military supplies and materials received rank first on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. Yesterday, He first went to the Shanghai Command Post of the Third Front Army on Jiangwan Road at 9:00 AM for inspection. After half an hour, he accompanied Commander Tang, Commander Huang Zhenqiu of the Logistics Department, Superintendent Yang Zhengmin of the Military Transportation Department, Commander Zhao Zhiyao of the Rear Supply Department, Railway Military Transportation Commander Jiang Chuou, and his entourage in more than ten cars to inspect various military supply warehouses in the Jiangwan area.

He and Commander Tang transferred to the Tenth Warehouse, and then to the Ninth Warehouse in Maqiao for inspection. Then, he went to the sports field warehouse in the city center. After the inspection, He drove to the Sino-American Cooperative Organization training center for inspection. At 12:30 PM, the car returned to the Shanghai Command Post of the Third Front Army on Jiangwan Road for lunch. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, He and his entourage continued their inspection, first visiting the Peace Museum, which displays antiques presented by Japanese residents. He was very interested in the antiques on display, especially admiring the authentic manuscripts of Shi Kefa and Yue Fei. At 2:40 PM, accompanied by Wei Jimin, Director of the Naval Office in Shanghai, and others, he went to Yangshupu to inspect the naval factory and naval warehouse, returning only in the evening. At 7:00 PM, Commander Huang Zhenqiu of the Logistics Department, Superintendent Yang Zhengmin of the Military Transportation Department, and Commander Zhao Zhiyao of the Rear Supply Department hosted a joint banquet for Commander-in-Chief He, Commander Tang, and He's entourage at the Haige Road Reception Center.

### Shen Weisheng Removed from Garrison Command

[Our Newspaper] Shen Weisheng, manager of the Shanghai Civil Transportation Shipping Bureau at 367 Jiangxi Road, 5th floor, privately solicited business for the "Hai Su" ship carrying National Army troops northward. After investigation by the city's military authorities, he was arrested and transferred to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation in accordance with the law. As for the previous report of government officials protecting him, it is possible that merchants were using false pretenses for fraud, which will be revealed after interrogation.

### Former Director of Puppet Salt Tax Administration, Liu Qian'an, Tried Yesterday; Cries with Family During Meeting; Nightclub Manager's Case Sentenced Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday heard four cases of suspected traitors in the morning and afternoon, and sentenced one case, as detailed below:

Liu Qian'an

Sixty-four years old, from Fuzhou, is a Christian. He resides at 77 Jianye Li, Fulilu Road. Due to his former position as Director of the Puppet Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Salt Tax Administration, he was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate. The defendant is old and frail, with white hair. He was escorted to the court by bailiffs yesterday and stated: He studied in the United States at public expense in his early years. After returning to China in 1912, he served in the Sichuan salt affairs authorities and once served as a specialist member of the Hebei-Chahar Construction Committee in Peiping. Later, he resigned and came to Shanghai. When the war broke out, he worked to rescue wounded soldiers, relieve refugees, and rescue comrades in distress. General Feng, who sacrificed heroically in the Battle of Taierzhuang, had his orphaned daughter raised by me. Later, due to unbearable family burdens, I took the position of Director of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Salt Tax Administration under the Puppet Reformed Government in April 1940. When the Puppet National Government was established, it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Puppet Ministry of Finance. I resigned at the end of June last year when the administration was dismantled. However, during my tenure, I did not seek fame or profit. Protecting the Haizhou salt fields and transporting salt to supply the people in the interior were all beneficial to the country. He couldn't help but sigh. The court allowed him to meet with his family, and they couldn't help but cry together. The court ordered him to be detained for further questioning at a later date.

Zhang Jinming

Sun Zhiyou and Wu Jiaqi were accused of forming a "Rickshaw Association" with the Japanese in the Hongkou District of Shanghai during the enemy occupation period, oppressing rickshaw pullers. The defendants denied the allegations, and the court ordered the case to be continued at a later date.

Wang Yongqing

A native of Zhejiang, he served as a plainclothes police officer in the puppet police bureau. The two cases of Ruan Defu being accused of serving as an informant for the enemy Seymour Road Military Police were both concluded after arguments, and the court ordered the sentencing to be announced at 2:30 PM on the 19th.

Yuan Shixiang

The case of Chen Zhuanzhang (nightclub manager) being accused of treason by Iraqi national Li Wei was concluded after interrogation, and the verdict was announced yesterday afternoon. The main text: This case is beyond jurisdiction and is transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for handling. The plaintiff's incidental civil claim is rejected.

### Large Quantities of Traitor Property Inventoried and Transferred

A certain military agency, under orders, arrested traitors in Shanghai and transferred them in batches to the High Court and the Army Headquarters for trial. A large amount of traitor property that was sealed under orders has also been inventoried and will be transferred to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration for receipt starting today. Each traitor's property inventory is divided into seven categories: (1) Real estate, including title deeds and land deeds. (2) Negotiable instruments, including bank deposit receipts. (3) Stocks, including government bonds and securities. (4) Ornaments, including jewelry and diamonds. (5) Gold, silver, and banknotes, including gold bars and foreign currency.

Commercial News

### US Dollar Ascends, Eager Buyers Abound - Gold Prices Rise Accordingly - Rumors Persist of Further Appreciation of the US Currency

Yesterday, the trend of upward movement in the US dollar continued. A portion of gold held as collateral was being returned due to the abundance of loose monetary conditions. Those who play both gold and stocks were compelled to cover short positions, resulting in increased buyer enthusiasm. Furthermore, rumors persisted of further appreciation of the US currency. Stimulated by the US dollar, the gold market was also driven higher. The long-dormant gold market experienced a slight surge in activity. Upon inspection, the market opened flat in the morning. Subsequently, some longs took profits, initially reaching 1,450,000. However, with the US dollar appreciating and buyer demand remaining strong, those with deficits continued to cover their short positions in preparation for repayment to the original owners. This subsequently created a situation of demand exceeding supply, gradually recovering to 1,560,000 before oscillating. Nevertheless, support largely remained around 1,510,000, as arbitrage positions created based on the US dollar persisted. At noon, the market hovered around 1,535,000. In the afternoon, buying interest did not wane, and prices briefly rose to 1,590,000 before experiencing a slight pullback. As a result, prices closed up 80,000 from the previous day. Gold jewelry in silver shops was priced at 170,000, refined silver at 1,500, and silver dollars were offered for sale at 1,030 yuan. The black market interest rate remained loose, ranging from 1.2 to 1.7 fen.

Due to frequent rumors from various sources that the US dollar was expected to appreciate further, buyer demand for US dollars was eager, and banks were readily accepting them. The market opened in the morning at 1,910 yuan, and buyers continued to push the price up to 1,970 yuan before experiencing a slight consolidation. At noon, the price remained above 1,950 yuan. Arbitrage spreads continued to hover around 760 yuan per ten taels. In the afternoon, the market continued to prosper, driven by buyer activity. As a result, the market closed up 75 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong banknotes remained stable, with new and old issues largely trading on par. New issues closed up 5 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were priced at 400 yuan, and Philippine pesos at 500 yuan. The bank rate for US dollars also rose to around 2,000 yuan.

### Major Players Manipulate the Market - Government Bonds Fluctuate Erratically

Yesterday, government bonds continued to decline, surrounded by what are commonly referred to as large market players engaging in selling pressure. Some longs were initiating short positions. Series C bonds opened in the morning at 4,400 yuan, briefly rising to around 4,800 yuan. Subsequently, large players led the selling, creating an atmosphere of strong selling pressure, pushing prices down by as much as 600 yuan, reaching a low of around 4,200 yuan. The market then consolidated, hovering around 4,300 yuan at noon. As a result, prices closed down another 250 yuan from the previous day. Other series (A, B, and D) also experienced declines of slightly less than 100 yuan, while Series E experienced a slight decrease.

### Chinese Stocks Heavy at the Top and Light at the Bottom - Foreign Stocks Sail Smoothly

Yue Guang Jumps Over 60%

Yesterday, with the exception of Wing On Textile, Mei Ya Silk, and Jing Fu Cotton, the other Chinese stocks were generally characterized by being marketable but having no market, and having sellers but no buyers. Although the three hot stocks (Wing On Textile, Mei Ya Silk, and Jing Fu Cotton) performed well, they lacked support. Short positions were relatively crowded, and there were frequent small-scale short squeezes along the way. However, out-of-favor and veteran stocks experienced declines without increases. Although Wing On Textile reached 5,450 yuan, Mei Ya Silk reached 4,500 yuan, and Jing Fu Cotton reached a high of 470 yuan, prices had retreated by noon. As a result, the three hot stocks (Wing On Textile, Mei Ya Silk, and Jing Fu Cotton) each closed up by about half a percent from the previous day, while out-of-favor stocks remained stable. Veteran stocks saw Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank retreat to around 90,000 yuan, and China Insurance Corporation had a supply of 4,200 shares with no demand. Zhongxing Coal Mine also had a supply of 95,000 shares. Most of the smaller stocks also experienced selling pressure. In the afternoon, pre-market trading was slightly higher, with Wing On Textile at 5,400 yuan, Mei Ya Silk at 4,400 yuan, and Jing Fu Cotton at 455 yuan. For foreign stocks, new longs from banks joined the market, and brokers favored Yue Guang Rubber. Ewo Silk remained the investment target of the general public. British American Tobacco Company was extremely scarce, and its market price had surpassed that of Ewo Silk. Ewo Silk opened in the morning at around 12,000 yuan, gradually rising to 12,700 yuan, and hovered around 12,500 yuan at noon. As a result, each stock closed up by about 10% to 15% from the previous day. China Land & Cultivation experienced a 20% increase due to its cheap base price. Yue Guang Rubber was favored by major players and jumped by 60%. Bidding prices remained upward after the close. The market was initially high and then low in the afternoon, and ultimately remained stable. It was rumored that the Association of Various Industries would hold a meeting in the afternoon to discuss merging with Chinese stocks, and that most of the bullish positions in the securities firms had flowed into the hands of Bank of Communications Xie's new longs.

### Rice Prices Continue to Decline Slightly

Yesterday, rice market digestion remained sluggish, and supply continued. It was rumored that relief rice from abroad might arrive in Shanghai, which dampened sentiment. Indica rice continued to decline by 1,000 yuan. White rice was readily sold as it arrived, with no significant changes. High-quality black rice was scarce, and prices rose by 1,000 yuan. The appetite for wheat flour from Shantou was very strong, and prices rose by 200 yuan. Wheat bran digestion in the interior continued, and prices continued to rise by more than 100 yuan. Soybean cakes were firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Soybeans also increased by 500 to 600 yuan, but only local vendors were taking a slight amount, and transactions were not significant. High-quality raw peanuts were active, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Medium-quality peanuts were sluggish and flat, with a trend of increasing the price of high-quality peanuts and suppressing the price of medium-quality peanuts. Sesame seeds still lacked prosperity. Corn recovered by 500 yuan. Cotton cakes were flat. The oil market saw sporadic arrivals from Dalian, and the selling of affordable oil continued. Vegetable oil and clear oil declined slightly by 1,000 yuan.

### Textile Construction Bidding Prices Increase - Yarn Market Shows Signs of Improvement

Yesterday, the yarn market showed signs of a turnaround. After the recent sharp declines, buyer interest had already been piqued, and the repeated good news from the gold market boosted sentiment. The prices of various yarn counts rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. 20-count yarn from major brands such as Shuang Ma had exceeded the 1,000,000 threshold. Unfortunately, transactions were still not active. The textile construction company held its regular goods opening yesterday, with a total of 30 types ranging from 1-count yarn to 100-count thread. Most of the bid prices were 10,000 to 20,000 higher than the previous period. According to industry insiders, the textile construction company's bid prices have been gradually declining in recent periods, which has effectively suppressed yarn prices. Although yesterday's price increase was not significant, it provided a considerable boost to sentiment.

### New Biluochun Tea Launched - Opening Price of 900,000 Yuan

Transactions of aged teas remain sluggish.

### Southeast Tea Loan - Total Amount of 10 Billion Yuan - Managed by the Farmers Bank of China - A Precursor to Developing National Tea Exports

(Our report) With the tea season approaching, the need for funds is urgent. Dr. Shou Jingwei, Chairman of the China Tea Industry Association, Wu Juenong, Chairman of the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association and Chairman of the Southeast Tea Region Factory Federation, and tea industry leaders Ye Shichang, Wang Zhenhuan, Zheng Jianyuan, and Huang Yantang have successively telegraphed President Song of the Executive Yuan and Governor Bei of the Central Bank, as well as the Four Joint Offices, requesting prompt approval.

In the future, tea packaging loans related to foreign exchange resources will be primarily managed by the Bank of China. It is also confirmed that this loan is being introduced by the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association, which is responsible for guaranteeing the repayment of loans for factories in the interior. Therefore, it has been decided that the association, together with the Farmers Bank of China and the Southeast Factory Federation, will conduct strict reviews to ensure due diligence.

(2) To avoid tea merchants having to travel to the interior to fulfill the guarantee contract and waste time, the business and factory sides jointly estimate the amount according to the production capacity of each factory, list the details in detail, and sign a guarantee agreement with the designated tea loan bank in advance. Then, the local factories in various places shall sign contracts separately with the local branches of the bank in accordance with the agreement.

(3) The loan period for production shall be limited to three months.

(4) This loan must be disbursed in the tea area and must not be used in Shanghai to avoid speculation and other malpractices.

### Final Act of the First Division Football League - Hequn vs. British Navy

At 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park

Today is the last battle of the first division of the football league, Hequn vs. British Navy. If the British Navy wins, it can surpass the Soviet Union and rank fifth. Hequn will not be able to remove the last seat no matter whether it wins or loses. The record of the first division is recorded below:

Today's game will be held at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park. The records of the two teams are mediocre, and the tickets have now been raised by one time, at 1,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan, so it may not be attractive. The British Navy lost to the Soviet Union 1-6 before, so it would be great if Hequn's young players could work hard to win once.

### About Writing Poetry

— Feng Cunzhao

A newly published poetry magazine on the market is called "Cotton Poetry Island," and its content is all poems and essays on poetry. I will not comment on all the poems in this publication for the time being, but I feel that I have some things to say about young people writing poetry.

There are two points that young people in general need to re-emphasize about poetry: one is the cultivation of poetry, which is also the rhetoric of writing. It should also have all complete words and sentences—for example, to be connected by nouns, real words, verbs, adjectives, and even prepositional words. It should not be the kind of sentence that uses more than three overlapping adjectives without interrogative words.

Beauty is one of the conditions of poetry, but its formation often comes after the completion of the overall organization. If you first select the words and phrases one by one, and then construct the words and sentences one by one as if they were generals, it will definitely become a palette, dazzling but actually empty.

Although poetry is not prose, writing good prose first and then writing poetry can at least avoid the above-mentioned defects.

### Two New Books on Psychology

— Ji Tongfang

Huang Yi: Child Psychology (Zhengzhong)

Fu Binran: Talks on the Psychology of Learning (Kaiming)

In recent years, there have been quite a few books published on psychology. However, few are suitable for the general public to read and can contribute to improvements in life. Recently, I read two books, one is Huang Yi's "Child Psychology," and the other is Fu Binran's "Talks on the Psychology of Learning." I feel that they are very suitable for general needs. Although these two books cannot be considered academic masterpieces, they are more closely related to our daily lives, so I am introducing them here.

The author of "Child Psychology," Dr. Huang Yi, taught at Zhejiang University for many years and presided over the Zhejiang University "Infant Research Institute." He had great insights into child psychology research. It is said that he fell ill and was isolated inland after the book was published. This is truly a loss to the academic community in our country. After reading Dr. Huang's posthumous work, I believe that it can cover important issues in child psychology in terms of content. Although it is only a small book of less than two hundred pages, it is sufficient to represent an overview of modern scientific child psychology. It can help readers understand the true meaning of modern child psychology and the basic principles that should be adopted in child education. That is why I say it is suitable for general needs.

The book is divided into sixteen chapters. The first chapter explains that child psychology is a science that studies the developmental process of individual behavior and briefly describes the value of studying child psychology. The second chapter describes the historical development of child psychology, allowing us to know how child psychology has progressed to modern scientific research. The third chapter indicates the methods for studying child psychology. The fourth chapter discusses the principles of development, providing a very detailed discussion of heredity and environment, growth and learning, as well as the laws and rates of psychological development, and the situation of individual differences. The fifth chapter points out the general trend of human psychological development from the psychological development stages of the embryonic period, childhood, and adolescence. Chapters one to five form a system that can be called an overview.

From chapter six onwards, important issues in child psychology are discussed. Chapter six, children's games, particularly emphasizes the relationship between games and education, indicating new concepts in education. Chapter seven broadly discusses the development of actions, and separately describes the development of actions in the embryonic period, newborn period, infancy, and early childhood, citing many recent experimental studies. From chapters eight to fourteen, various aspects of children's development are still discussed in detail -- perception, language, intelligence, social behavior, emotions, needs, morality. The development process, differences, changes, and advancements are discussed for each, and necessary training and controls in various aspects of development are also discussed. Chapter fifteen discusses children's mental health issues based on the principles of mental hygiene, and briefly states the mental hygiene principles that should be followed in mental illness and pathological personality, children's daily behavior, and training. The final chapter is an example of child guidance issues, showing practical examples in child education, such as obedience, anger and crying, fear, stuttering, children who use their left hand, intelligence and behavior problems, and physical defects, all proposing effective remedial methods.

There are usually two methods of writing child psychology: one is purely scientific research, which focuses on theoretical discussions, with the purpose of understanding children's behavior and the principles of their development; the other is to apply the principles of psychology to children's education, focusing on the application of practical life, which belongs to technology. These two different writing methods have completely different natures. Huang's book should belong to the application type. Broadly speaking, child psychology includes the entire development from conception to adulthood. Because the book is suitable for the standards of the Ministry of Education's normal school curriculum and can be used as a textbook, it focuses on the period before six or seven years old, also paying considerable attention to elementary school, and briefly mentioning adolescence. I think it would be most appropriate to use this book as a textbook for kindergarten normal schools or normal schools. Housewives can also get more practical knowledge about raising children from this book.

The difference between this book and previous publications on child psychology is that it does not cite too many experimental statistical materials, and focuses on the explanation of principles. Originally, the author believed that the destination of learning is not in cumbersome facts and numbers, but in the meaning and principles of these materials. This attitude is correct for beginners. Also, the viewpoint of this book is close to "Gestalt Theory." Concepts such as "alternate reflection," "intuition," "chatting," and "reflex arc" are naturally not adopted. First, we should pay attention to clear concepts in order to grasp the thought of the whole book. For beginners, compiling child psychology should avoid difficult theories and academic disputes, but a unified point of view should not be lacking. Therefore, the author adopted the developmental theory that he considered the most consistent with the facts, and took the Gestalt theory as the center of thought.

I think the strength of this book is that it is concise and the views are correct. However, there are still many issues, such as thought, concepts, worldview, continuation, and artistic activities, which cannot be avoided from the scope of discussion due to the limitations of space. I think this is a regret.

In recent years, psychological knowledge has been increasingly applied to practical life. The development of applied psychology is the happiness of mankind's future. The most widely used psychology is, of course, various activities in education, and the name of learning psychology is often put together with educational psychology. It is actually the most important part of educational psychology. Ordinary educational psychology mostly discusses learning psychology, and books that specifically explore psychology describe the learning psychology problem in more detail, what learning laws, learning transfer, learning environment, and the effective principles of learning are described in each part. However, the general defect of this type of book is that it is biased towards the enumeration of theories, with few citations of facts, and it is written very rigidly, almost making people feel that it is all mechanical articles, and it does not seem to be entirely related to our lives (learning activities are also one of our lives).

The recently published "Talks on the Psychology of Learning" by Kaiming does not have this defect. The author of this book, Mr. Fu Binran, wrote several important issues in learning psychology, tailored to the needs of real life, into independent topics, which were published in installments in the "Middle School Student Magazine." This book is a collection of these articles. Because those articles were able to grasp the central issues to be discussed in learning psychology, they had a large number of readers inland after they were published. Although this collection is composed of independent topics, unlike the usual learning psychology, which is divided into chapters, from introduction to main body, from the narration of general concepts to the discussion of special problems, those single articles have an invisible connection. The only fascinating thing about this book is that it does not adopt the narrative of general textbooks, but uses light brushstrokes and vivid examples to apply the various basic principles of learning psychology to real learning activities.

Learning cannot be separated from life. Combining various explanations of learning, we should compare and verify our usual learning activities with these theories. The article "What Do We Learn from Reading the Books of Sages?" uses Song Qiao's words as an introduction to explain what we have learned in our daily learning, and what are the differences between the acquisition of habits and skills, the learning of knowledge, and the learning of appreciation and ideals. Regarding the issue of heredity and environment, there is appropriate insight in "Planting Melons Gets Melons, Planting Beans Gets Beans." As for which is more important, it can be seen from several points summarized by the author. "Second, what heredity gives us is only various specific abilities, not specific content. The second point is that hereditary ability is only a possible tendency, that is, a starting point for plasticity. The third point is that humans are the most plastic organisms, and whether the hereditary ability can be fully developed depends on the social environment." "The Most Intelligent and the Most Stupid" concludes the relationship between intelligence and learning. In the normal distribution, the absolute majority is of medium intelligence. Personal achievement still depends on one's own efforts. Even if one has extraordinary talent, it can only be developed and expressed in a good social environment and education, and a good environment and education can still be learned through one's own struggle. "From Conscience Money to Character" uses the conscience money donated by the citizens of Guilin during the Anti-Japanese War for the honor soldiers who went to the front line to explain the social and psychological meaning of morality, and to explain that character is composed of behavior, and can in turn affect behavior and determine behavior.

In recent years, the mental hygiene movement has been attracting much attention. Educators unanimously agree that only by applying the principles of mental hygiene can human life be improved and social culture promoted. The author, in "Sour Grapes Sweet Lemon Philosophy," explains abnormal psychological phenomena from adaptation and motivation based on these principles, analyzes various bad adaptation methods that can affect mental health one by one, and suggests several key points on mental hygiene methods. "Starting from the Worship of Four Books and Five Classics and Latin," the author gives an objective criticism of the psychological principles of "Fachly Psychology," "Erulcation as Formal Discipline," and "The Translerssof Learning," and believes that formal training is unreliable. He also narrates the application of the theory of learning transfer in learning: "First, we should pay attention to the materials we learn have direct practical effects. Secondly, our learning life should pay attention to integrating with actual life and pay attention to the principle of learning from doing. Thirdly, the method of learning and the method of guidance have a very significant impact on learning." After explaining several common phenomena in learning, the author's "Talks on the Learning Curve" mainly wants us to avoid unnecessary self-satisfaction, self-admiration, self-pity, and self-deprecating in the uneven learning environment, and to arouse learning enthusiasm and interest to improve learning efficiency. Memory and forgetting are often discussed in learning psychology. The author uses the topic "A Bad Memory Is Worse Than a Rotten Pen" to study this problem. The author suggests to us that memory is certainly important, but memorizing by rote is not the way. It is better to guide students to "think" more than to instruct them to "remember" more. In recent years, psychologists have said a lot about the experiments on the learning ability of adults. The results all prove that the learning ability of adults is not weak. The author selected the topic "If You Don't Work Hard When You Are Young, You Will Be Sad When You Are Old" to illustrate the importance of adult education and the reasons why it is ignored, and to encourage everyone to pay attention to the advancement of adult education. "The Psychology of Reading" tells us how to improve the understanding ability of reading, which is to apply scientific methods to reading. The last article "Two Stories" cites the stories of Lu Chunyang preaching and selling stinky tofu to discuss that both "learning methodists" and "learning theorists" have their reasons. However, the author compromises these two concepts: "We think that the learning itself is of course fundamental. Without learning, there is no method. However, the method of learning should also be valued. The method of learning is the experience gained by predecessors from hard work. This experience is enough for us to take many detours and enough for us to increase learning efficiency."

In terms of the content of this book, although it is a collection of individual articles, there is a clear system that can be found from beginning to end. From the first article to the last article, it can form an organization by itself. I think this method of writing has the advantages of textbooks (clear system) without the defects of textbooks (rigid compilation). The principles of educational psychology are placed in a "fun" narrative, and reading it will naturally not feel boring.

### Libraries in the United States

— Rú Shuǐ

The earliest library in the United States was established in Virginia in 1621. Public libraries open to the public were not available until 1653. The modern library that can be borrowed from outside the library was started by President Franklin, which was already in 1731.

At present, there are more than 20,000 public libraries in the United States, and the circulation of books is more than 100 million volumes, excluding those set up by schools and institutions.

The circulation methods of libraries are divided into urban and rural browsing. There are circulation stations in the city, mailing stations between cities, and special vehicles are sent to rural areas to exchange reading on time.

At present, the largest library in the United States should be the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. It has 6 million books and has a history of 150 years.

These libraries not only provide library browsing, but also regularly hold concerts and lectures.

The economic source of libraries, in addition to a part of the national tax subsidy, mostly comes from

The level of a country's culture depends on the reading ability of its people. This statement does contain a profound truth.
