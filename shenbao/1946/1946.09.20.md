[Urgent Telegram from Gui Sui, Central News Agency, 19th] The National Army recovered Fengzhen and the old site of Liangcheng County (the old site of Liangcheng County) on the Ping-Sui Line in the afternoon of the 19th. Only Xinghe County in eastern Sui has not yet been recovered. (Note: Fengzhen is located about 70 li north of Datong)

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Another National Army force advancing south in eastern Sui recovered Liangcheng at 1:00 AM on the 18th. As of now, only Xinghe County in eastern Sui has not yet been recovered.

[Report from our newspaper in Gui Sui, 19th] The vanguard cavalry of the National Army in eastern Sui has now reached the vicinity of Longshengzhuang. After recovering Liangcheng in southern Sui yesterday, the National Army has cut off the support for the Communist Army in northern Yan in the Dahai Po Basin and can pass through the plains, approaching Fengzhen. Northern Yan refugees returning from Suiyuan are currently active in the Youyu Nanshan area, posing a major threat to the rear of the Communist Army in southern Sui. Since the Hequ security forces moved into the county seat and Yangguan Laoying, the Communist militia who defected in the northwestern Shanxi separatist area have also emerged like a rising wind in eastern Sui. Near Pinglu County, there are National Army soldiers who were scattered near Datong, led by An Dangguo, attacking the road between Yan'an and Zhangjiakou.

[Telegram from Gui Sui, Central News Agency, 19th] Gongguiying Guyingpan and other places two kilometers southeast of Jining were occupied by the Communist Army's 11th Brigade and Training Brigade under Nie Rongzhen. On the 15th, they were all defeated by the National Army, and the above strongholds were firmly recovered.

[Report from our newspaper in Tianjin, 19th] It is reported that in the Jining battle, the Communist Army has lost half of its entire force in eastern Sui, southern Chahar, and northern Shanxi, which is obviously a destructive blow.

[Report from our newspaper in Gui Sui, 19th] The 600-strong Wulejiao Suer troops of the puppet Mongolian army on the border of Chahar and Sui harassed our Wuchuan rear when the National Army recovered Jining. They were repelled by the defending troops and the Fourth Prince Banner security forces. After the recovery of Jining, the puppet army fled to Sonid Right Banner.

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] It is now confirmed that Zhangjiakou has presented the state of the Communist Army before withdrawing from Chengde. The airfield was destroyed the day before yesterday. The weekly liaison plane of the Military Mediation Department failed to fly out today. The power plant has also been destroyed. All important materials and machines have been completely moved. Fortifications have been built throughout the city and outside. The radio station of the government representative of the Zhangjiakou Group of the Military Mediation Department was ordered by the Communist side to be dismantled yesterday, and the actions of the government and American members were monitored. The government has protested to the Communist side, and the American side is particularly concerned about the safety of the group. Therefore, they have proposed to the government that the group be withdrawn, saying that the plane can no longer land in Zhangjiakou, then the Communist side will send the group members to the National Army defense area on the border of Hebei and Chahar, but the Communist side has not yet expressed its position.

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Today, the reporter visited the military relations authorities to inquire about the combat strength of the Communist Army and the Zhangjiakou issue. It is said that, as evidenced by the speed of the National Army's recovery of the twelve counties in eastern Hebei, and the successive capture of Zhuozishan and Jining in eastern Sui, forcing Fengzhen, and the Communist Army's siege of Datong with 80,000 troops against the defending army of less than 10,000 people, but has not yet captured it, the strength of the Communist Army can be seen. The huge losses suffered by the Communist Army in the mutual encirclement battle of Jining were the heaviest since the Siping Street battle, and its impact on the future operations of the Communist Army is similar to the Siping Street battle. Therefore, Fengzhen is like Changchun, and the National Army will follow it when it arrives. Observing the various performances of the Communist Army in Zhangjiakou, it is not easy to say whether it will abandon Zhangjiakou, but if the government wants to recover Zhangjiakou, even if it fights the National Army with the same force as attacking Datong, it will be of no avail, and it is even doubtful whether it can maintain it for a week. It is also learned that, in addition to the Communist Army in Datong, the Communist Army in Zhangjiakou and its periphery is 50,000. When the battle in eastern Hebei ended, about 10,000 people from Li Yunchang's troops went west to the south of Miyun on the Pinggu Line, where they were intercepted by a regiment of the National Army and suffered more than 1,000 casualties.

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Relevant parties learned that the border between Hebei and Chahar is becoming increasingly tense. The National and Communist armies have each increased their forces to two armies. The border between the two armies has prohibited travelers from passing through. Yesterday, a teacher who went to Zhangjiakou turned back when he reached the border.

[Telegram from Gui Sui, Central News Agency, 19th] The eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway has been completed after the railway bureau was assisted by troops along the way to rush to repair it. On the 18th, it was opened from Gui Sui to Zhuozishan, and on the 19th at 3:00 PM, a train was reopened eastward, directly to Jining.

[Report from Agence France-Presse in Beiping, 19th] According to reports here, the government army is expected to capture Zhangjiakou within ten days.

### Chief Chen Flies to Gui Sui, Will Transfer to Taiyuan to Meet Commander Yan

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Chief Chen Cheng left Beiping at 9:07 this morning and flew to Gui Sui. Chief Sun Lianzhong and other leaders went to the airport to see him off. Before his departure, Chen purchased several boxes of antiques and daily necessities in Ping as gifts, intending to give them to Commander Fu Zuoyi and other senior generals in Suiyuan to show his condolences. After Chen inspects Gui Sui, he will transfer to Taiyuan to meet Commander Yan Xishan if necessary, and then return to Nanjing. Chen gave a lecture at the headquarters of the Eleventh War Zone last night, recounting that political consultation and Marshal Ma's mediation both failed due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity. He then explained the government's determination and the understanding that active-duty generals should have, saying: If the Communist Army does not lift the siege of Datong, the use of force is inevitable, and the battle must be won. Finally, he recalled his combat experience.

### The Communist Army in the Suburbs of Datong Collapsed and Fled to Yanggao Overnight

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] It is reported that the Communist Party of the Military Mediation Department once expressed to the government that it was willing to lift the siege of Datong, but the government said that since the National Army in eastern Sui had already begun to act, it was too late to talk about lifting the siege, and lifting the siege was not limited to the city of Datong alone, all three county towns in northern Shanxi occupied by the Communist Army must be withdrawn. This issue was shelved.

[Telegram from Datong, Central News Agency, 19th] The Communist Army's dream of attacking the city outside Datong has obviously been completely shattered recently. Since the 16th, there has been a symbol of retreat. On the 16th, the National Army recovered the Police School in the west of the city, the Wulidian Majunying, Songjiadian, and the airfield in the south of the city, Shuiquanwan, Beiyue Temple, and Zhoujiadian one after another, and counterattacked Caojiabao, Shaling, Caifulou, Qiyipo and other places. On the 17th, the National Army in the north of the city recovered important strongholds such as Beiguan and the railway station, and the Communist Army there fled to Qilibao and Huwan.

[Telegram from Taiyuan, Central News Agency, 19th] On the 16th and 17th, the Communist Army in the suburbs of Datong retreated to Julebao successively through Ershilipu and Sanshilipu in the east of the city, reaching tens of thousands of people.

Currently, there are no battles within 40 li around Baoding. The military and political authorities are comforting the people and rushing to clean up the countryside.

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] The materials in Gaoyang City, Baoding Telephone, have been completely moved away by the Communist Army, and at the same time, a large army has been assembled in an attempt to fight the National Army in the area. The National Army advancing towards Anguo County has reached 20 li from the county seat.

[Telegram from Central News Agency in Baoding, 19th] The Communist Army that has been attacking Dawei Village, 25 kilometers southwest of Baoding, and the 13th Brigade Cavalry Regiment and other units of the Communist Army newly transferred from Shandong to the south bank of the Tang River in Baoding, fearing encirclement by the National Army, urgently retreated to Dongfu. A unit of the National Army has successfully entered Anguo County (east of the Pinghan Railway, south of Baoding).

According to reports from the Jinpu, Pinghan, Jiaoji, Pinggu, and Pingsui lines in the past two days, it is proved that the Communist Army on each line is generally preparing road excavation tools and laborers, and at the same time, avoiding the heavy and moving to sections with slightly sparse defenses.

[Telegram from Xuzhou, Central News Agency, 19th] At 2:30 PM today, the National Army completely recovered Huaiyin. The Communist Army there collapsed completely and fled in the northeast direction. Huaiyin is the main base of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu. In order to ensure the occupied area of northern Jiangsu and further threaten Beijing and Shanghai, the Communist Army specially transferred Xu Xiangqian to lead his troops from Shandong to reinforce the defense of northern Jiangsu, sitting in Huaiyin and planning military affairs. In total, there were six divisions of the Communist Army there, holding dangerous positions. In order to eliminate the threat to Beijing and Shanghai, the National Army advanced towards Huaiyin after recovering Siyang, to urge them to wake up as soon as possible and abandon their attempt to use Huaiyin as a base to harass central Jiangsu. On the afternoon of the 17th, they broke into the city. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, they joined forces with the National Army outside the city and finally completely recovered it on the afternoon of the 19th. After this defeat, the Communist Army's morale was greatly reduced. At present, a small number of villages and towns outside the city still have resistance.

### The United States Has Never Considered Freezing Wartime Surplus Materials Transported to China; Agreement Recently Signed to Implement Quickly

[Joint News Agency, Washington, 18th] According to sources in authority here, the United States has no intention of freezing wartime surplus materials transported to China recently. Officials also said that no such action has ever been considered. Related sources further pointed out that any terms of the recent US$800 million transaction with China will not have any impact on curbing China's civil war, as reported in Nanjing. Authorities also said that the first thing to explain is that the shipment of this large amount of materials from the battlefields of China and seventeen islands in the Pacific to China is a long-term task, and only a small portion may be completed in one or two years. The source then pointed out that the United States will ship materials as soon as possible in the recently signed agreement, and the US officials who handle this matter are all enthusiastic, because this transfer of surplus materials is also to offset the account with China. During the war, China built airfields for the US military and supplied the US military with supplies. This transfer of materials can offset the equivalent of US$120 million of the amount the United States owes China.

[Report from our newspaper in Jiangyin, 19th] Although the main force of the Communist Army in Jingjiang has withdrawn to the north, small groups are still harassing the countryside.

Unexpectedly, when the government representative Zheng Jiemin and the American committee member Robertson broadcast according to the words passed by the three parties, when it was the turn of the CCP committee member Ye Jianying to broadcast, Ye suddenly violated the previous agreement and attacked the government and the United States in his speech, and the language was extremely absurd. Zheng Jiemin immediately proposed to stop it. Robertson was particularly indignant at Ye's breach of trust and promise, and stated that the broadcast should be sent to Yan'an and a copy should be sent to Marshal Marshall.

### Next Year's Financial Policy: Increasing Revenue Will Be More Important Than Reducing Expenditure; The General Budget Will Be Delayed Until November

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing, 19th] It is learned that due to objective circumstances, reducing expenditure will be more important than increasing revenue in next year's financial policy. For the revenue part of next year, the financial authorities hope to increase revenue through increased collection of inheritance tax, comprehensive income tax, etc., to enrich the national treasury, but the prospects are not good due to restrictions of various technical conditions. In addition, income from the sale of enemy and puppet industries and state-run enterprises cannot be expected too optimistically. Therefore, central agencies will inevitably reduce staff and streamline administration. In terms of local finance, county-level finance can be improved after the reform, while provincial finance remains difficult, so austerity is also necessary. Relevant people expressed that, based on the speed at which various agencies are preparing budgets, the general budget for next year may be delayed until November.

He also said: He is deeply saddened by the fierce fighting in various parts of China, so he hopes that the Communist Party can quickly participate in the five-person meeting. When the reporter asked whether the content of the report on the talks of the Philippine formal five-person group meeting had been expanded, he replied: This has not been considered yet. When the reporter asked whether the distance between the opinions of the Communist Party and the government was very far, whether the ambassador and Special Envoy Marshall intended to have new compromise opinions, he replied: The primary task at present is still to convene the five-person meeting to solve the problem of the distribution of the National Government committee member quota, and then talk about other things after there are achievements. Also, the ambassador's private consultant, Chuan Jingbo, visited Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party delegation at 11:20 AM on the 19th and came out at 12:00.

Unless the chairman agrees to reopen the military three-person meeting, I will not return to Nanjing.

### Zhou Fohai's Confession - Cultural Traitor Zhou Zuoren's Public Trial Postponed

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The transfer of the five major traitors, including Zhou Fohai, is expected to occur in a few days. They are living comfortably in their quarters, with their daily needs and affairs being taken care of by the staff. The four individuals they brought along—a caretaker, maid, adjutant, and cook—have been allowed to enter and leave separately over the past two days. Their daily breakfast consists of pastries at their own expense, while lunch and dinner include five dishes and a soup, with both fish and meat. Recently, Zhou Zuoren has been drafting his confession, reportedly amounting to over ten pages.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The Capital High Court originally scheduled the public trial of the major cultural traitor Zhou Zuoren for the morning of the 19th. However, due to incomplete evidence investigation, no debate was held. Instead, the court only questioned Zhou Zuoren for an hour regarding the results of the investigation into the evidence he submitted. At 10:30 AM, Presiding Judge Ge Zhiqin and Judges Ge Zhaotang, Yang Yutian, and Prosecutor Wang Wenjun convened a collegiate panel at the Dacheng Hall. Zhou Zuoren, accompanied by lawyer Wang Long, appeared in court wearing a blue-gray cloth long gown, black casual shoes, and yellow-rimmed glasses. He appeared calm, although his temples were gray and his expression seemed aged. Presiding Judge Ge routinely inquired about his name, age, and origin before commencing the sequential review of the evidence investigation results. Many of these were favorable to Zhou Zuoren, particularly the letters from former Peking University President Jiang Menglin and President Hu Shih, confirming that they had instructed him and three other professors to preserve the university's property, ensuring no losses and even a slight increase upon the victory of the resistance, which was most advantageous. A letter from Yuan Tongli, Director of the Peking Library, attested that no books were lost during Zhou Zuoren's tenure as director. Regarding the rescue of Ying Qianli and Dong Xifan, the former had already left Northwest University, and the latter was in Shanghai on official business, with the investigation incomplete. Zhou Zuoren considered this unimportant, impatient to wait any longer, and requested an immediate public trial and sentencing. The court ruled that a thorough investigation should be conducted, and the hearing was adjourned until Dong Xifan's letter from Shanghai was received in Beijing and Ying Qianli returned. The defendant was then returned to the Tiger Bridge prison.

### Zhou Longxiang and Xu Fengxiang Both Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

Ding Jun was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Zhuge Pu was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Qian Sen was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.

### Zhang Beisheng's Death Sentence is Currently Under Review

[Our Dispatch from Suzhou, 19th] Zhang Beisheng, the former Minister of Civil Affairs of the puppet Jiangsu Province and Commissioner of the Northern Jiangsu Clearance, was previously sentenced to death by the Jiangsu High Court after a retrial. His case is currently under review by the Supreme Court. Today, the High Court specifically ordered Zhang Beisheng to be transferred from the detention center to the Third Prison. Local circles generally anticipate that his execution may not be far off.

### Zhang Yanqing Released

Based on Evidence of Underground Work

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] Zhang Yanqing, former Vice President of the puppet Xinmin Association, was arrested for treason. After multiple interrogations by the Hebei High Prosecutor's Office, he was released with a decision not to prosecute. According to reliable sources, there is evidence that Zhang engaged in underground work, which was confirmed after repeated investigations, hence the decision not to prosecute.

### US Military Tribunal Established in China with Our Consent

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] An official from the Judicial Yuan stated: The establishment of a US military tribunal in China to try German war criminals was done with our full consent. The government issued a decree regarding this matter last winter. As the Judicial Yuan is part of the National Government, there is no need for further expression. The recent trial of German war criminals in Shanghai by the US military tribunal, where the defendant's lawyer boldly claimed it was "illegal," is without foundation.

### US Aircraft Crash Story Turns Out to Be a Hoax

[Our Dispatch from Kunming, 18th] Following the accusation against High Court President Lu Shizeng by Zhejiang merchant Lu Shousheng, the local People's Freedom Protection Committee and public opinion organizations have expressed unanimous support. Recently, Lu published an announcement in the newspapers, stating in essence: "I am lacking in virtue and inferior in learning, and I am ashamed to be the head of the High Court, often feeling overwhelmed. I have repeatedly requested to resign due to the heavy responsibilities, but my request has not been granted. The recent reports are all based on one-sided accounts," and so on. The Yunnan Supervisory Office has expressed great concern, and the senators also stated that this is the first step towards eradicating the darkness within the judiciary.

### Heavenly Rain Falls, Osmanthus Blooms - The People of Hongdu Eagerly Await the Chairman's Arrival

— Our Special Correspondent, Fang Cangcang

Sights and Sounds of Nanchang, Part Two

The suburbs of Nanchang, the largest basin on the eastern bank of the Gan River, receive only about 1,200 millimeters of rainfall annually. The summers are extremely hot. This autumn, there have been southerly winds and light rain, making the scorching heat unbearable. Recently, there have been two showers over three days, diminishing the intense heat. With the heavenly rain, the osmanthus trees will bloom. (There are five osmanthus trees in Qingyunpu, planted during the Tang Dynasty.)

The elders of Hongdu and the citizens of Nanchang are eagerly looking towards Mount Lu, hoping for the arrival of the leader. Various unconfirmed rumors have been circulating from Guling in recent days, but they have not diminished the enthusiasm of anyone welcoming him. The temporary office of Chairman Jiang in Nanchang will be selected either at the Taishi Mansion or the Provincial Government. Accompanying personnel will stay at the Hongdu Reception Center. The telecommunications staff of the Xiang-E-Gan District Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, under the leadership of Director Hong, has created a second miracle after their great achievement in Guling. The necessary communication facilities for the Chairman's office have been prepared excellently. News reporters from Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan have also been well-treated, enjoying the convenience of rapidly transmitting news. The salaries of Nanchang telecommunications staff are very low due to funding shortages, often relying on future income and borrowing to make ends meet. However, their service ethic is second to none.

Jiangxi's literary tradition is strong, no less than that of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Education was very developed before the war. Now, due to the inability to recover, it is facing a dire situation. Fortunately, the news industry in Nanchang has shown significant progress. There are currently seven newspapers, including the Minguo Daily, China News, Xinwen Daily, Lixing Daily, Jiebao, Dazhong Daily, and Huaguang Daily. There are also the Wenshan Bao and the Xin Shangbao, Fengbao (evening paper). The content and format of the newspapers are no less than those of newspapers in other ports. The salaries of reporters are unbelievably low. It is said that the highest monthly salary is no more than 200,000 yuan. However, their work spirit and style are commendable. Most endearing is that they still retain the excellent local customs of courtesy and frugality from the time of Xu Ruzi.

Without visiting Jiangxi, one cannot know the inherent difficulties of politics in Jiangxi. The general criticism of Taishi Hui's achievements in Jiangxi is in accounting and statistics. The former was done very effectively, while the latter was done quite ordinarily. Later, following the examples of "Neng" and "Cao," these two tasks were also done satisfactorily. Therefore, at present, Jiangxi's civil administration, finance, construction, education, security, social affairs, and health must undergo reform to meet current needs. According to a Jiangxi elder, the geography of Jiangxi (referring to the Yangtze River, Poyang Lake, Gan River) has benefited and harmed Jiangxi (referring to the Yushu, Jiulian Mountains on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border, the Wuyi Mountains on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, and the Wugong Mountains and Wanyang Mountains on the Hunan-Jiangxi border). Those engaged in politics must work practically and proactively. According to the current urgent needs, civil administration, education, security, and health must be carried out boldly. As for finance, construction, and social affairs, they can be done step by step, aiming for daily progress without empty promises. It is crucial to avoid vanity and recklessness and to use fewer incompetent people.

The corruption at the grassroots level of Jiangxi's politics has not yet been eradicated. The political atmosphere at the provincial level is still considered upright. However, yesterday, reporters from Shanghai and Wuhan at a public banquet at the Chamber of Commerce heard a gentleman roughly describe the unsuitable practices of Nanchang tax officials in assessing business taxes and profit taxes. He also mentioned that Jiangxi's grain administration is also a painful issue. A good grain official who sacrificed his life for grain has already been laid to rest in the Martyrs' Cemetery next to Qingyunpu, but the province's grain has not yet been fully delivered. When people see the strict orders to transport the remaining grain, they seem to have unspeakable sadness. Everyone clenches their teeth and curses the Communist Party.

Yesterday, the reporter visited the Wanshou Palace in the urban area, still the only remaining magnificent building among the temples in Nanchang. The incense is very popular in the temple. It is said that from the eighth month of the lunar calendar to the end of the year, it consumes at least two to three million yuan every day.

The Nanchang-Ji'an highway was completed yesterday and opened to traffic today, allowing unimpeded passage from this province to Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, and Anhui.

Among the outer counties, Huichang has the highest prices recently. The price of rice has risen to more than 50,000 yuan per stone.

The anti-banditry work on the Jiangxi-Guangdong border is progressing smoothly. Recently, 22 bandits were executed in Dayu, and 45 bandits were executed in Longnan in one go, greatly delighting the people. (Sent from Nanchang on the 17th)

### UNRRA Far East Regional Conference Concludes - UNRRA Food Rice to be Diverted to Famine Areas - Foreign Ships Assist in Transporting UNRRA Relief Supplies

[Our Dispatch] The UNRRA Far East Regional Conference continued at 11:15 AM on the 19th at the Bank of China Building, with Jiang Tingfu still serving as chairman. There were two key issues discussed: (1) US representative Kirkpatrick proposed that the world is experiencing a food shortage this year, and some areas of China are fortunately experiencing a good harvest. Therefore, he suggested that UNRRA food supplies to China be diverted to areas that are confirmed to be famine-stricken and can be reached by transportation. Jiang Tingfu believed that Kirkpatrick's proposal was clearly unfavorable to China and inconsistent with the resolutions of the UNRRA General Assembly. He immediately stated that China could not accept it and refuted it with reason. Jiang stated that if this proposal were passed, the Yellow River disaster area project would be halted, and it would be difficult to determine whether a certain area truly needed relief. China's better harvest this year is due to the climate, but some areas that were unable to plant due to war damage will still have no harvest even with a good climate. The US representative denied that this move would affect the Yellow River project and said that his proposal would allow relief efforts to be properly planned in advance. Soviet representative Seminass seconded the motion, saying that he had just returned from inspecting the disaster area and believed that the cause of the famine was not entirely due to the lack of food, but also due to improper distribution. Therefore, he believed that the US representative's proposal was "relevant and necessary." The case was then put to a vote, stating that the UNRRA Far East Regional Conference is a deliberative body, and all resolutions do not have legally binding force. (2) To increase the speed of UNRRA relief supply transportation, the US representative suggested assistance from foreign ships. Jiang Tingfu pointed out that this matter involved a wide range of issues and was quite complex, and said that the British representative would know this in detail. However, after a vote, it was still passed.

Finally, the Soviet representative urged the conference to consider General Tranard's organization of an air transport team, but he did not make a formal proposal, so no decision was made at the conference. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The 25th UNRRA Far East Regional Conference was thus concluded. The next conference is scheduled to be held on November 13.

### Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Proposes Many Motions - Closing Date Extended Again

### Yangcheng Lake Area Anti-Security Conference Holds Preparatory Meeting Today - Will Carefully Review Pacification Proposals

[Our Dispatch from Suzhou, 19th] Major General Ma Shigong, commander of the Yangcheng Lake area clearance command, decided to eliminate the lurking bandits in the jurisdiction by military force to consolidate security. He specially convened with Deputy Commander Xu Shiguang, ordering the county magistrates and military section chiefs of the four counties of Su, Chang, Kun, and Tai to report to the parachute command headquarters in Suzhou on the 20th to participate in the four-county security conference. It is learned that the focus of the conference will be on a thorough review of pacification proposals related to the distribution of local armed forces, the control of land and water transportation, the organization of communication networks, and the establishment of funding. The four county magistrates have first ordered their military section chiefs to arrive in Suzhou to attend the preparatory meeting on the 20th, and the county magistrates will gather in Suzhou on the 21st to participate in the formal meeting on the 22nd.

[Another Dispatch] Major General Fu Jinfang, commander of the Taihu Lake area clearance command, arrived in Suzhou on the 19th to preside over the commencement of clearance work. The reporter made a special visit to Fu to inquire about the working policy. He said: "The task of suppressing bandits depends on the assistance of the people to achieve greater results with less effort. Therefore, our only belief is to never disturb the people. All clearance units will bring their own supplies and strictly prohibit local requisitioning. Any violations will be severely punished."

### Hunan-Hubei Area Investigation Team - Requests Extension of Closing Date

[Our Dispatch from Hankou, 19th] The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Area Investigation Team has requested an extension of its closing date to Beijing because the work has not yet been completed.

Editorial

### Independent and Autonomous Foreign Policy

Following his return from the Paris Peace Conference, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Wang Shijie, held his first reception for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing the day before yesterday. He reiterated that our country's foreign policy is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit when concluding commercial treaties with friendly nations. At a time when the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are all seeking to negotiate commercial treaties with our country, Minister Wang's statement is of great significance. He said, "The established policy of the Chinese government is to make every effort to utilize foreign capital and technology to develop China's resources and improve the living standards of the Chinese people. This is the guiding principle of our recent legislation regarding commercial company issues and related matters." He also stated, "The Chinese government intends to grant most-favored-nation treatment to all countries that will conclude strong commercial treaties with us. The condition for enjoying this treatment is reciprocity. China does not intend to adopt any discriminatory treatment against any foreign country in any part of its territory."

Minister Wang's remarks clearly and concisely explain the guiding principles of our country's foreign policy. They can not only dispel any doubts that various countries may have about our foreign policy, but also arouse the sympathy of countries around the world towards our country. However, its meaning is profound and requires further explanation.

First, foreign policy should be based on the needs of our own country. After eight years of arduous resistance war, our country has won victory, but it has long been exhausted. Looking at the domestic situation, the country is scarred and its vitality has not yet recovered. In addition, our country's production technology, whether in agriculture, industry, or mining, is very backward compared to friendly nations. In this environment, it is not easy to talk about national revival and construction. Fortunately, China has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. As long as there is capital and technology, it is not difficult to develop these rich resources.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nation-building strategy has long pointed out the way for Chinese people to utilize foreign capital to develop resources. Now that we are about to engage in the work of construction, the first priority is to develop industry and commerce to improve the living standards of the people. Therefore, utilizing foreign capital and technology to develop resources is indeed the most urgent need at present. However, special attention must be paid to "sovereignty being in our hands," with everything determined by China's needs. We must not go astray and allow China to become a playground for foreign capital competition, gradually falling into the status of an economic semi-colony.

Second, foreign policy should have an independent and autonomous function. For its own needs, as well as for world peace and the progress of humanity, our country concludes commercial treaties with all friendly nations based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, without discrimination against any country. This is entirely based on our country's autonomy and is not subject to any constraints. In terms of the current actual situation, our country's industry has not yet been industrialized and cannot stand on an equal footing with friendly nations. Reciprocity is simply out of the question. To be honest, so-called reciprocity means that China suffers a loss. However, friendly nations must know that there should be a limit to China's losses. Diplomacy is originally a political technique for defending national survival. If it cannot exert an independent and autonomous function, then the so-called equality and mutual benefit will lose its meaning.

Third, foreigners' view of China seems to have not yet been thoroughly reformed in its basic concept. When foreigners discuss Chinese politics, they either say "non-interference in China's internal affairs" or "China should remain outside the sphere of influence of the two major powers," or they say "open door" or "equal opportunity." In fact, these outdated clichés, in the eyes of ordinary Chinese people, seem to still not regard China as an independent and autonomous country. Even if foreigners do not have this intention, at least they have not recognized the position that China should occupy in world politics in the future. Minister Wang said, "If this attitude can be regarded as an open-door policy, then this so-called open door is actually China's own policy." In other words, since the door is our country's door, the sovereignty of whether to open it or not rests entirely in our country's hands. We open our door without harming our country's sovereignty, but if foreign countries must demand it of us, then it seems that China's door is to be decided by them.

Fourth, since our country's foreign policy is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, it will not allow any country to enjoy special privileges in our country. This is the unanimous wish of our country from top to bottom. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally expressed this view to the late US President Roosevelt in Cairo and obtained Roosevelt's agreement. But what is the actual situation at present? We will not talk about Hong Kong and the Kowloon leased territories being still under British rule, but have we jointly used Lushun and Dalian according to the Sino-Soviet treaty? Therefore, we have to point out that for countries enjoying special privileges in China, as long as their privileges are not abandoned, how the principle of equality and mutual benefit can be applied will inevitably become a major problem.

In short, diplomacy is an extension of domestic affairs and has its indivisible nature. Especially in an era when power politics prevails, in order for diplomacy to be powerful, it is even more necessary to improve domestic affairs. Although our country's foreign policy is theoretically very sound, it must first seek domestic unity and strength before there is hope for success.

### The Issue of Establishing a Governance Office in Kowloon City

After the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a proposal requesting the government to expedite the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon, the issue of adjusting the governance of Kowloon City has become a hot topic in the past few days. The incident originated from the fact that the Shian County Government of Guangdong Province intended to send personnel to establish a governance office in Kowloon City within its jurisdiction. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the 1898 Beijing Treaty, believed that this was feasible. Just as preparations were underway, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government suddenly stated: "The jurisdictional rights of Chinese officials in Kowloon City have been declared suspended because they conflict with the military needs of the British side." Our country's diplomatic authorities then issued a statement denying the allegations of the Hong Kong government spokesperson, believing that according to the 1898 Sino-British Treaty, which allowed "the Chinese officials currently stationed in Kowloon City to continue to perform their duties in the city, provided that they do not interfere with the military preparations for the defense of Hong Kong," our country could certainly send personnel to establish a governance office in Kowloon City, and had not relinquished the jurisdictional rights in Kowloon City, especially since the duties of each official "must not interfere with the military preparations for the defense of Hong Kong." The case of establishing a governance office in Kowloon City is currently being negotiated with the Hong Kong side by the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi. The people of the country are closely watching how it will develop in the future.

Kowloon City is the site where fortifications were built and garrisons were established in the Qing Dynasty to defend the sea borders. Its occupied area is not large. Even before the Pacific War, it had already been abandoned and dilapidated, only serving as a place to reminisce and lament the past. The British have managed Hong Kong and Kowloon, but have allowed Kowloon City to remain desolate. This shows that Chinese officials should have been stationed in Kowloon City to perform their respective duties. From a legal point of view, there is absolutely no question that our country retains sovereignty over Kowloon City. However, now that the people of the whole country are expecting a solution to the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon issue, hoping to see Hong Kong and Kowloon return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, the proposal to establish a governance office in Kowloon City at this time seems a bit like creating unnecessary complications and neglecting the fundamental for the trivial. We certainly do not suspect that this is an attempt to divert the attention of the people of the country, from the recovery of the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon to the establishment of a governance office in Kowloon City. But the proposal of this issue will undoubtedly confuse the theme of recovering Hong Kong and Kowloon. What we want to win back now is not an abandoned Kowloon City, but the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon! Whether the proposal of this kind of trivial issue can be beneficial to the recovery of the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon is really worth our consideration.

Interstate relations are like personal relationships. We cannot ignore the relationship of emotion. The current international situation is such, and our domestic political situation has not yet become stable. At this time, we need friends even more. China and the United Kingdom suffered the most in World War II. China resisted the aggression of the Japanese militarists independently in Asia, and the United Kingdom also resisted the aggression of the Nazis independently in Europe. China and the United Kingdom are friends in adversity. On the reconstruction of the post-war world order, China and the United Kingdom need to work closely together. Churchill, who "did not come to liquidate the empire," could not get the support of the British people with his great achievements for the United Kingdom, which shows that they had a clear understanding of their country's future. The government formed by Attlee originally advocated amending the traditional British policy to adapt to the new environment of today. The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the granting of independence to India are all indications of changes in British foreign policy. Under this situation, the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon seems not difficult to achieve. In diplomatic relations, it is important to use them properly. At this time, we should seek to make friends with other countries, and we cannot ignore the United Kingdom, which has traditional relations with us. Therefore, we should now cherish the friendship between China and the United Kingdom. The proposal of establishing a governance office in Kowloon City may be an unpleasant event in Sino-British relations. If we think from a long-term perspective, we feel that the proposal of this kind of trivial issue gives people the feeling of seeing an autumn hair but not a cartload of firewood. Observing that the British ambassador visited Minister Wang without mentioning the issue of establishing a governance office in Kowloon City, we can know that this issue has not yet attracted diplomatic attention.

In short, for the place where sovereignty lies, even an inch of land, we should certainly fight for it. That is absolutely no problem. However, now that the people of the whole country are eagerly awaiting the recovery of the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon, the proposal of establishing a governance office in Kowloon City has turned the theme towards complexity and triviality. If the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon are recovered, there will certainly be no problem like this Kowloon City. We want to ask, what does the government intend to do to negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon? But at the same time, we want to declare that the demand for the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon is for China and also for the United Kingdom, and should certainly not be regarded as the Chinese people having the slightest anti-foreign sentiment.

### The Villagers are Crying!

Ripe rice, fat ducklings, fresh fish and crabs, lotus roots as big as boats, green water caltrop and red water caltrop contrasting with each other, what a beautiful autumn scene of a land of fish and rice in Jiangnan. However, in this beautiful picture, there are large numbers of villagers with pure souls crying! The atomic bomb brought the country victory, but the atomic bomb cannot take away the villagers' tragic fate. The exploitation of the enemy collaborators, the post-war trauma, the pain is still heavily pressing on the villagers. The township society is getting poorer and poorer, the villagers' lives are also getting lower and lower, and the dream of living in peace and starting a business has become the sorrow of disillusionment. The villagers, who are destined to be ill-fated, seem sad, seem sentimental, but are actually fearful!

Today's villagers actually live in a "bandit" world, where they cannot eat or sleep in peace. Robberies occur almost every day, everywhere, at night, and also during the day. The bandits are either many or few, and the many possess hundreds of people, looking like an army, with machine guns and small steel cannons. They even openly send letters to the district office, demanding provisions, otherwise they will enter the town by force. The district office reports to the county government, and the county magistrate issues a document, telling them to defend themselves. Self-defense requires people, self-defense requires money, and self-defense requires guns even more; even if manpower and financial resources can come from the local area, where do the guns come from? Private individuals are prohibited from hiding guns, and the government does not issue or sell guns, how can they defend themselves? They are just deceiving people! There is no police force in the townships, and the Baojia organization only plays a corrupting side effect. The good people can only sit and wait to be robbed, or move to big cities. The urban population has increased sharply. In addition to escaping the disaster of the Communist Party, the abundance of bandits is also a main reason. Producers are turning into consumers, which is further causing a situation where those who produce are few and those who eat are many. How can the people not become poorer and the wealth not be exhausted?

The villagers' farming has already reached the end of the road. The price of rice is suppressed and cheap, while wages and prices are rising steadily. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to evolve into "cheap grain hurting farmers." Taking the eastern township of Kunshan near Shanghai as an example, taking one mu of land as a calculation, the best harvest can get one and a half shi of rice. Each shi of rice is currently worth 40,000 yuan, and one mu can get 60,000 yuan, which is almost the same as the cost. Each mu needs one bean cake for fertilizer, 12,000 yuan, five workers for contracting work, each worker at a minimum price of 4,000 yuan, a total of 20,000 yuan, and also six dou of rice for rent, 24,000 yuan. How much is left? The villagers work hard all year round, what are they doing it for! When the rice is sold, the price of rice is particularly cheap. The villagers have to repay their debts and must use glutinous rice; when the glutinous rice is gone, the rice price rises again. In March and April, when the new crop is not yet harvested, the farmers have no rice to cook, and they have to buy expensive rice. The people who grow rice cannot eat cheap rice themselves. Is there anything more unfair in the world than this? As for the requisition of military grain, it is another bad luck for the villagers. The grain purchase money issued from above is initially similar to the market price, but the people who handle this payment below use it for profit-making purposes. When the order is urgent and the grain is to be delivered, the price of rice is already expensive at this time, so they forcibly suppress the villagers and collect rice at a low price. What have the villagers done wrong to bear this heavy burden!

Township education is on the verge of bankruptcy. With bankrupt education, how can education not go bankrupt? The county does not have education funds and requires the townships to raise half of them. It is stipulated that the local area will maintain it for the first three months of the school year, and then the county government will find a way for the next three months. The townships are too busy raising funds to prevent bandits, how can they care about education? Therefore, they have to charge tuition and miscellaneous fees. Although the fees of around 20,000 yuan are just a drop in the bucket for the school, they are already unaffordable for the parents. As a result, a large number of school-age children are out of school. The salary of township teachers, including everything, is only 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per month. Is this little money better used to buy rice or buy vegetables? Some teachers are forced to hire teaching assistants and work as peddlers themselves. If they follow the rules and take the right path, there is only a dead end!

Because of poverty and ignorance, villagers have particularly many diseases and they are particularly prevalent. The enemy who invaded the country has gone, and the enemy who invaded the body remains, waiting for us to fight against it. Returning to the village after demobilization, looking at the fellow villagers, hardly anyone is there. Some died like morning dew, while others were buried in the night. "Time slips away like a fleeting glimpse, and even a boat cannot be secured for long." The mountains and rivers are in sight, but people are far away. The dead are all young and strong people, mostly dying from tuberculosis, dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera. Most of the young people who are alive are suffering from malaria, tuberculosis, indigestion, venereal diseases, trachoma, and scabies. The villagers do not understand preventive knowledge, and there is no scientific diagnosis and treatment, so they do not know how many lives are being wasted. The number of normal pregnant women and healthy babies who should not have died but died is also alarming. Chinese people are worthless, and Chinese villagers are even more worthless; when a person dies, it is like the death of a cat or the death of a dog, and it is passed over lightly. This phenomenon is spreading in every township in the country.

The unfilial traitors in the cities have mostly bowed their heads in front of legal justice, while the spineless traitors in the townships, because the villagers dare to be angry but dare not speak, are still at large. The money they obtained shamelessly is being used to buy fields, buy land, open stores, and open factories under assumed names, and they are still overbearing. After another period of time, I am afraid they will be full of morality again, acting as gentlemen with powdered noses, oppressing the good people. And the bright and righteous people who are unharmed by water and fire, on the contrary, do not have enough food and clothing, and things are getting worse. Such a society in the township that is neither black nor white only makes the loyal people cower and the cunning ones succeed! The traitors welcome the invaders as their fathers, pretending to be powerful by wearing the skin of tigers, selling out the country, and oppressing their compatriots, offsetting the power of the resistance war, and prolonging and deepening the pain of the villagers. Their crimes are actually worse than the enemies. When I hear the villagers say, "We are not afraid of the enemy, we are really afraid of the traitors." It is also a shameful thing that such scum has come out of the simple countryside. The important foundation of our resistance war is the righteous spirit of the nation. If these national dregs are not punished, there will be no such thing as justice in the world. The officials who are close to the people should first eliminate the traitors in the townships.

Our country is established on agriculture. Confucius said "prosperity" and Mencius said "permanent property," all of which are inseparable from agricultural affairs. Culture originated in farming, but now the township society is unstable, the villagers have thousands of disasters and hundreds of difficulties, how can agriculture develop? How can culture be rooted? The plan for now is, first, to stop the internal turmoil and seek a peaceful and unified country, strictly enforce the Baojia system, disarm and dismiss the scattered military guerrilla teams, issue firearms, strengthen and organize local self-defense teams, and help each other with neighboring towns to thoroughly solve the bandits. The prices of rice, goods, and wages should be adjusted at the same time to eliminate the abnormal market. The requisition of military grain should be limited to a short period and should be done during the grain ripening season. The central government should subsidize local education with large funds. Health agencies should be widely dispatched to the countryside, and health education should be widely implemented. According to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's statement in 1944 that traitors would be strictly dealt with, we must ensure that the loyal and the treacherous cannot stand together and that the evil and the righteous must be distinguished, so that good people have courage. This needs to be proven by shooting a bullet through the chest of every vicious traitor!

### Wallace to Remain in Current Position, Foreign Policy Debate Truce, Agreement Reached Yesterday with President Truman, Guaranteed Silence Until End of Peace Conference

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Secretary of Commerce Wallace went to the White House today to visit President Truman for a long talk. Afterwards, Wallace told reporters that he would remain in his current position but guaranteed not to make public speeches for the time being. Wallace's official statement said: "The President and the Secretary of Commerce had a long and friendly discussion. Afterwards, the Secretary concluded that he should temporarily refrain from making public statements or speeches until the end of the Paris Peace Conference." The difficult situation caused by Wallace's speech attacking Secretary of State Byrnes' foreign policy at Madison Square Garden in New York on the 12th of this month has thus been clarified. According to Wallace's aides, Wallace guaranteed silence after President Truman agreed with some of Wallace's views on American foreign policy. However, political observers pointed out that Wallace did this in order to retain his right to speak in the future. Once the peace conference ends, Wallace will again make public remarks, creating domestic tensions again, which will be enough to affect the general election in November of this year.

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] After President Truman and Secretary of Commerce Wallace met last night, a truce in the American foreign policy war has been established. Therefore, whether the American cabinet crisis can be avoided depends on the attitude of Secretary of State Byrnes, as Byrnes has the inherent right to preserve or break this "truce." So far, Byrnes has not announced any reaction to the compromise reached between Truman and Wallace. President Truman talked with Wallace for two and a half hours, and Wallace has expressed his willingness to shut up, so it is expected that Byrnes will continue to allow this person, whose foreign policy views are in extreme conflict with his own, to serve in the cabinet. The New York Times commented that Wallace no longer has the freedom to speak. In fact, there is no harm in Wallace not being a cabinet member and expressing his opinions to the public. The problem now is that there are two people in the cabinet who advocate opposing foreign policies at the same time. I wonder if their foreign policy can stand up.

Waiting for News from the White House, Byrnes will Decide His Attitude Again

[Our Newspaper] Washington, 19th Radio Paris News: US Secretary of State Byrnes lives in seclusion and only interacts with British representative Alexander. Byrnes has not made any criticism so far, and will express his attitude at least after the results of the Truman-Wallace meeting are announced tonight. The British delegation believes that this matter will not weaken Byrnes' position and is purely an internal American matter. Although the French representative also insisted that this is an internal American affair, he revealed anxiety. A diplomat openly pointed out that this matter seriously affects the position of the American delegation in the peace conference.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] White House Press Secretary Ross announced that Secretary of Commerce Wallace sent a letter to President Truman on August 23, a copy of which has been delivered by the President to Secretary of State Byrnes, and the original letter has been filed in the White House. No one seems to know how the contents of this letter fell into the hands of American reporters.

### Before the Opening of the United Nations General Assembly, the Peace Conference Can Conclude its Work, the Trieste Issue Still in Dispute

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 19th Radio: The Paris Peace Conference has been overshadowed by the uproar caused internationally by Wallace's speech, but the committees are working hard to speed up their work in order to conclude the conference's mission before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly on October 23. The two most important committees of the peace conference, the Political Committee for Italy and the Economic Committee for Italy, stepped up their work last night, because judging from the current pace of work, there is little hope of ending the work of the committees on October 5. So far, the Political Committee for Italy has still failed to resolve the dispute over the southern border of Italy and Trieste, and the Economic Committee for Italy is being troubled by the issue of compensation. The work that is progressing relatively quickly is only the Military Committee and the Political Committees for Bulgaria and Finland, especially the Military Committee, because the military terms of the Italian peace treaty have almost all been completed.

### Military Committee Approves Limits on Italian Navy and Army

[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] The Peace Conference Military Committee today approved the provisions restricting armaments in the Italian peace treaty, stipulating that the Italian Navy be reduced to two battleships. Four cruisers and destroyers each, and a number of small warships. The army's headcount is reduced to 250,000, and heavy and medium tanks are limited to 200. Most of the remaining warships will be divided by the four powers, and the rest will be dismantled.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] The Economic Committee for Italy met today and, after discussing Article 66, immediately passed its first paragraph (i.e., Italy relinquishes all claims against the United Nations), the second paragraph (i.e., the Italian government must repay the currency issued by the Allied Command in Italy), and the third paragraph (i.e., Italy must not make any claims regarding the measures taken by the Allied Powers to deal with Italian ships). In addition, the Trieste subcommittee also met this afternoon to discuss the powers that the legislative council of the district should have. The atmosphere was very tense and no agreement was reached. Representatives of various countries either advocated the establishment of an authoritative government, or argued with the opposition, with no progress.

### Hu Shize Arrives in Paris

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] Chinese representative Hu Shize, who was sent here by United Nations Secretary-General Lie to be his private observer attending the Paris Peace Conference, arrived here this afternoon.

### United Nations General Assembly Session to Last Six to Seven Weeks

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Radio: The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held on October 23. There are many difficult issues on the agenda, such as the admission of new member states, the election of the Security Council, and trusteeship issues. Other issues, such as the Spanish issue and the veto power of the five permanent members, may also be raised, but only with unanimous consent can they be placed on the agenda. The President of the General Assembly is Spaak, and the Vice-Presidents are the chief representatives of the delegations of China, France, the Soviet Union, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. The General Assembly will last approximately seven weeks, meeting six days a week, with no evening sessions. The meetings of the General Assembly and its committees are open to the public.

### Franco Once Received Money and Arms from Germany and Italy

[United Press, Madrid, 18th] The Franco government, which once received financial and military assistance from Germany to seize power, may soon find itself in an awkward position and be forced to settle the matter with the United Nations. Since Franco's rise against the Spanish democratic government on July 18, 1936, Germany and Italy have begun to provide aid. Mussolini's aid between 1939 and 1945 amounted to five billion lire. In December last year, Spain negotiated with the newly established Italian government, due to the low value of the lira, setting its debt at $50 million. A spokesman for the Spanish Foreign Ministry called this debt a "debt of honor." The amount of aid Hitler provided to the Franco government has never been disclosed, but well-informed sources estimate it to be about 400 to 500 million marks. According to pre-war values, this would be no less than $160 to $200 million. During the war, Spain transported various goods to Germany, estimated to have repaid 300 million marks. The United Nations Control Commission for Germany, as the custodian of the German people, is currently liquidating the accounts between Germany and various neutral countries. Agreements have been reached with Switzerland and Sweden, and negotiations are underway with Portugal, with Spain being next in line.

### Instability on the Greek Border

Plan to Seek Assistance from the United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 18th] According to reliable sources, the Greek border has recently been attacked by armed forces from neighboring countries. The Greek government plans to seek assistance from the United Nations Security Council to ensure the security of the Greek border. Furthermore, according to official announcements, assassinations are increasing in Greece, and robberies and arson are particularly rampant.

### Chinese Representative on Security Council Argues Against Emphasizing the Greek Issue, to Avoid a Political Mistake

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 18th] The United Nations Security Council met today to continue discussing the Ukrainian representative's complaint against Greece. The Dutch representative, Kleffens, proposed that the Secretary-General of the Council call upon the governments of Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria to do their utmost to prevent border disputes. The Chinese representative expressed the opinion that the Council was too preoccupied with the Greek issue, which would constitute a political error. This issue is merely a temporary phenomenon in the international situation. From a legal perspective, the situation in Greece does not threaten peace and security. The French representative, Parodi, also stated that the Security Council had no reason to further discuss the issue of British troops stationed in Greece or to assume that Greece harbored aggressive intentions. However, the Council should form a sub-committee to discuss border incidents. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, insisted that the Greek government was pursuing an aggressive policy and that the American proposal to establish a commission of inquiry was an attempt to divert attention.

### British Government Denies Polish Troops Concentrating in Transjordan

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Reports circulating in the capitals of both the Soviet Union and Poland that Polish troops under the command of General Anders, currently stationed in the Middle East, will concentrate in Transjordan have been denied by well-informed sources in London.

### Churchill Calls on France and Germany to Join Hands in Speech in Switzerland, Hoping to Rebuild the European Family

[Agence France-Presse, Zurich, 19th] British wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered a speech at the University of Zurich today, reviewing the German question. He stated, "We must deprive Germany of all opportunities to rearm, as a permanent solution. However, it must be stated that if we want to rebuild the international family of Europe, France and Germany must reconcile. France must restore its moral influence over Europe, and France and Germany will remain the two most vibrant countries in Europe. We must establish and support the United Nations to establish the European family. This family, we call it the United States of Europe, or propose it with other names, all are possible."

### Few Men in Vienna, Difficult for Women to Find Mates

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcasting from Vienna: According to Vienna municipal statistics, the city has a population of over 1.6 million, of which women account for over 930,000 and men only 660,000. In terms of women finding mates, there is a clear shortage of men, and Vienna women will have to wait about twenty years before they have equal opportunities. However, according to another statistic, in May 1946, Vienna had a total of 476 boys born and 395 girls born. If this trend continues unchanged, the supply and demand of men and women will soon be balanced.

### Dutch Trio Arrives in Batavia

[United Press, Batavia, 18th] The Dutch delegation of peace envoys to Indonesia arrived in Batavia today by plane from Amsterdam.

### New Contributions to Global Economic Cooperation: Two International Financial Institutions to Finalize Regulations

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund, after four years of preparation, are largely ready and will soon assist countries in need around the world. The two major institutions have reserves of over $15 billion, opening a new era for international economic cooperation. The governments of 30 member states will send delegates to Washington on the 27th of this month to finalize the regulations of the two institutions, and they are expected to open for business in about three months. The tasks of the institutions are as follows:

(1) To maintain each country's currency on a balanced basis, so that the people of each country can trust their own and other countries' currencies, creating the possibility of promoting trade. (2) To provide any kind of short-term loans to countries that do not have funds to purchase goods from other countries. This will allow these countries to continue importing goods and manufacturing products for export. (3) To provide long-term, low-interest loans to assist countries in reconstruction and development, especially those affected by war. This will help rebuild industries and even build new industries. This project is a long and arduous task, and it will take many years to see results. At the same time, another similar institution, the International Trade Organization, initiated by the United States, is still in the planning stage and is expected to be established in the second half of next year. The purpose of this institution is to find ways to reduce tariffs and eliminate other restrictions that hinder the exchange of goods between countries.

[Reuters, Manila, 18th] Philippine President Roxas has appointed Ambassador to the United States, Elpidio Quirino, as the Director of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Quirino has just returned to Washington after attending the United Nations General Assembly in Geneva.

### Arab Secret Army Prepares to Resist Jewish Riots

Jews Implement Disobedience Movement

[Reuters, London, 18th] The Pakistan Conference was quiet today. The Arab Wago will meet again tomorrow to convene a plenary session the next day. The Zionist Organization Committee will meet tomorrow to decide whether the Jewish Association will participate in the Pakistan Conference. Gulikson, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Association, has also agreed to participate, but the forces of opposition cannot be ignored.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 18th] The Arab side here announced today that the Pakistan Arab Nagada Secret Army has been commanded by the Arab Higher Executive Committee to resist Jewish terrorist activities. However, this has not been officially confirmed. It is rumored that the leader of the Nagada Army, Huwari, a lawyer, said that Jewish terrorism has taken direct action against the Arabs, and his 25,000 troops are willing to fight with all their strength.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] Jewish municipalities and local councils throughout Pakistan decided today to allocate £100,000 annually from their budgets to fund Jewish immigration work. This is the first step in implementing the so-called civil disobedience movement.

### How Much Silkworm Cocoon Remained in Japan I Request MacArthur to Investigate Thoroughly The Claim That Chinese Silk Suffices for Factory Needs Is Not True

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Li Binghan, spokesman for the Chinese delegation, told foreign reporters this morning that the delegation had requested MacArthur to investigate the "surplus" Japanese silkworm cocoons. China had requested that these silkworm cocoons be used for barter trade, but the Allied Headquarters had not yet agreed. If the Allied Headquarters does not reconsider its policy of stopping the shipment of surplus Japanese silk to China, the Chinese silk industry will face serious difficulties. The claim reported by United Press that Chinese silk factories already have silk available for use is not true. There are rumors in Tokyo and elsewhere that a commercial group is attempting to monopolize the Japanese silk industry. Although the Chinese delegation does not believe in these rumors, it sincerely hopes that MacArthur Headquarters will conduct a thorough investigation to clarify how many silkworm cocoons are available for import into China.

### Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Value New Franco-Vietnamese Agreement

Overseas Chinese Merchants Will Be Restricted in the Future

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 18th] The 500,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam have a direct relationship with the new Franco-Vietnamese agreement. The overseas Chinese unanimously welcomed the signing of the new Franco-Vietnamese agreement, which has stabilized the chaotic situation in Vietnam to some extent. The unification of the Vietnamese monetary system, making the chaotic currency of Vietnam today uniform, is naturally beneficial to overseas Chinese. However, the establishment of a customs union and completely equal commercial treatment between France and Vietnam, as stipulated in the new agreement, is noteworthy. French businesses will be able to enjoy various privileges based on this, and the businesses of overseas Chinese in Vietnam for decades will inevitably be restricted as a result. They believe that overseas Chinese will now be based on the Sino-French treaty to conduct business here. If the new Franco-Vietnamese agreement is far from the Sino-French treaty, the overseas Chinese will ask the government to fight for it.

### Redistribution of Land in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany

The Aim Is to Eliminate Large Landowners

[Reuters, Stuttgart, 18th] A large area of land in the American zone of Germany will be broken up and used for farming by farmers. This land redistribution law, drafted by representatives of the three states in the American zone, has been approved by the American military government. The purpose is not only to eliminate the political power of large landowners, but also to provide a place for homeless farmers, especially the Germans expelled from Eastern European countries. All land that is not personally cultivated, where the landlord does not reside on the land for most of the year, land that is poorly cultivated, land that refuses to pay grain in kind, and land that is more than 100 hectares per person are subject to re-allocation.

### Atlantic Telegram Blocked by Sunspots

[United Press, New York, 19th] This telegram company and wireless receiving station reported today that transatlantic wireless and cable telegrams are still blocked by sunspots.

### One of Ali Baba's Forty Thieves Captured at Cairo, Former Nazi Prisoner of War

[Reuters, Cairo, 19th] German prisoners of war escaping in Egypt are not uncommon. Recently, a German prisoner was found hiding in a large stack on the roof of a house in Cairo, like one of Ali Baba's forty thieves. He was deported from Abyssinia to Egypt for detention. After escaping, he served in a clothing store set up by an Egyptian without being recognized. Later, as the situation became tense, he hid in the stack. There are fewer reports of Italian prisoners escaping.

### Exposure of Japanese-German Collusion: International Court Presented Evidence Yesterday The Axis Powers' Plan Was to First Take Singapore, The Attack on Pearl Harbor Was the Last Scheme of the Japanese Military

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Prosecutors at the Far East International Tribunal began exposing the Axis conspiracy today. Former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo was deeply convinced that Japan's power was sufficient to defeat the United States and had assured Germany that only a portion of its forces would be needed to subdue the United States. Deputy Prosecutor Wenner claimed that Tojo had told former German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop that there was no need to worry about fighting the United States on land. At that time, Germany made various demands on Japan: (1) Occupy Singapore and destroy the British fortress in the Pacific, causing a major blow to its war against Germany. (2) Keep the United States busy in the Pacific, unable to participate in the European war. (3) Japan should fight against the Soviet Union before conquering British, French, and Dutch territories in the South. Tavena also said that although Japan was prepared for war before July 1941, it had not decided to go to war with the United States, which shows that there were other unpublished reasons between July and December 1941 that caused Japan to suddenly attack Pearl Harbor. After Hitler obtained the supreme command of the German army, Germany's Asian policy changed, not only withdrawing all aid and guidance to China, but also hoping that Japan could deal a final blow to China. According to Hitler's decision, if the United States joined the European war, Japan should attack Singapore and the Philippines. Unexpectedly, between July and December 1941, the Japanese war party made a major decision to attack Pearl Harbor, which affected the overall situation. The former ambassador to Germany, Oshima, and the ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, both deceived Tokyo and guided Germany to induce Japan to participate in the European war. The development of German-Japanese relations during these years is as follows: [1936] The Japanese Kwantung Army was afraid of a Soviet attack from the north and did not dare to go south. [1937] Germany was dissatisfied with Japan's incident in China. After the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident, it warned Japan to be responsible to the world. [1938] Hitler obtained supreme command, withdrew all military advisers from China, stopped supplying military materials, and recognized the puppet state of Manchukuo. In October of that year, Germany and Japan jointly recognized their enemy as the Soviet Union. [1939] Oshima and Shiratori refused to transmit Tokyo's telegrams to the German government that they should consult before taking any military action against the Soviet Union. The German-Soviet agreement frightened Japan. [1940] The United States and Britain showed an increasingly tough attitude towards the puppet government established by Japan in China.

Japan's southward advance would surround Vietnam and Siam, making Germany uneasy, but Japan assured Germany that it would trap the US fleet in the Pacific, preventing it from participating in the European war. Ambassador Kurusu told Germany that if Japan occupied Singapore, it could help Germany end the war against Britain sooner. [1941] Oshima informed Germany that Singapore must be occupied by large-scale land and sea operations. Hitler personally agreed to give Germany's scientific inventions to Japan, and also agreed to fight. Japan informed Germany that if the United States joined the European war, Japan did not intend to attack the United States immediately. Between July and December of that year, Japan changed its plan to attack Singapore due to unpublished incidents and attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7.

Deputy Prosecutor Tavena presented an overview of various documents to prove that Japan's decision to attack Pearl Harbor was the last decision among its thorough conquest plans. The Japanese military, after recognizing the new situation in the late summer of 1941, decided to attack Pearl Harbor. Before this, most Japanese leaders still wanted to destroy Britain's Singapore base and create a prosperous East Asian empire, only showing the minimum force to the United States. They had been discussing military conquest plans with Germany since 1939, lasting four years. In September 1940, former Japanese Army Minister Tojo declared at a Privy Council meeting: "With the strength of our army, we can go to war with the United States. It is enough to use only a part of our full strength." Later, when Japan and Germany negotiated the Axis Pact, the focus was entirely on occupying Singapore, which was considered a fatal blow sufficient to destroy Allied forces in Asia. Germany wanted Japan to sweep away Britain's forces in the Far East and directly or indirectly keep the United States busy interfering in Europe. Japan was preparing to challenge both Britain and the United States, but various documents only occasionally mentioned the possibility of attacking the Philippines. Even at the Imperial Conference in July 1941, there was no preparation for the attack on Pearl Harbor.

It is also known that when the trial opened today, Deputy Prosecutor Tavena began a new stage of the case, reading the words of Oshima, the former ambassador to Germany, admitting that he had secretly planned with Ribbentrop. Tavena said: "I will prove that the negotiation of the military treaty was conducted through the Japanese military channel. I will also prove that the Japanese army was so powerful that it could force the government to act according to the army's will." Defendant lawyer Logan quickly seized the opportunity and asked: "Is this saying new, Mr. Tavena, are you representing yourself? Or are you speaking on behalf of the entire prosecution team?" If the prosecutor admits that the Japanese military controls the government and is so strong, then the Japanese cabinet members and other government leaders on trial may be able to exculpate themselves from war crimes by simply executing the military's tough orders. President Webb said: This point is a concern of the court. Tavena looked a little dazed, so Webb adjourned the court five minutes early, "giving him a moment to think," obviously to facilitate Tavena's consultation with Wanam. Also, when Tavena mentioned that Tojo was confident that he could defeat the United States and boasted that only a part of the Japanese army was needed to defeat the United States, Tojo stared at the ceiling in the defendant's seat and slowly scratched his chin.

### Review Results of the Municipal Government's Annual Expenditure Budget: Reduce Administrative Expenses, Increase Project Expenses; Revenue and Expenditure Difference Approximately 20 Billion; Collection of Donations and Taxes Pending Assembly Decision

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ninth Budget Review Committee held its final review meeting yesterday at 6:00 PM at the Shanghai Municipal Council in Fuming Village. The speaker and conveners of each group were specially invited to jointly review, along with Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan, Municipal Government Accounting Director Min Xiangfan, and Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping, totaling approximately twenty people.

First, the convener of the Ninth Group, Xu Yongzuo, stated that due to the rushed timeframe and limited information, a detailed review of the budget could not be conducted. Considering the 33.3 billion yuan difference between revenue and expenditure for the second half of the year, the only way to bridge the gap is to "increase revenue and reduce expenditure."

Regarding expenditures, the total annual expenditure is 84.7 billion yuan. After the review committee's examination, it is proposed to reduce personnel expenses by applying a universal 15% reduction to the 52.5 billion yuan allocated for personnel, which could reduce the amount by over 7.87 billion yuan. Unnecessary expenditures will be eliminated, and procurement and repair costs will be reduced by 30%, saving over 500 million yuan. Approximately 2.39 billion yuan will be reduced by cutting and consolidating organizations. It is proposed to abolish: (1) the Housing Rental Committee, and (2) the police department's mounted patrol unit. Aside from living allowances, the budget for the mounted patrol unit is over 160 million yuan, which should be eliminated to strengthen the vehicle patrol unit. The budget for the vehicle patrol unit is 1.64 million yuan. If two additional teams are added, then an additional 150 million yuan would be required. A total of 10.777 billion yuan could be saved. This would make the actual budget 73.939 billion yuan, but expenditures for constructive projects will be accepted in full.

On the revenue side, the review determined that revenue should be increased by 3.756 billion yuan. The actual revenue and expenditure difference will then be 18.793 billion yuan.

Later, Councilor Li Wenjie presented a statistical report on revenue and expenditure increases and decreases: The budget for constructive project expenses should be 26.8 billion yuan, including: 2.78 billion yuan for education and culture, 11.9 billion yuan for public works, 1.1 billion yuan for public utilities, 6.9 billion yuan for health, 320 million yuan for social welfare, 1.5 billion yuan for security police, 560 million yuan for finance, 1.1 billion yuan for land administration, plus 500 million yuan for public buses and small loans.

Three Principles for Reducing Expenditures

There are three principles for reducing expenditures: (1) Personnel who have been added to each bureau but not yet formally employed will not be included in the budget; (2) Among the 9,000 workers and 3,500 laborers in the municipal government and its affiliated agencies, the number of workers should be appropriately reduced; (3) Independent units should be merged as much as possible, such as the Public Utilities Bureau's pier and warehouse management office. The reduction standard will be determined based on the circumstances. Furthermore, the Ninth Group Review Committee initiated a proposal for Municipal Councilors to forgo their transportation allowance of 10,000 yuan per person. Although this would save only a few million yuan, it represents the councilors' example of thrift.

The principle for increasing revenue is to not increase the burden on the general public. The types of revenue that can be increased include vehicle license tax, banquet tax, new vehicle registration fees, slaughterhouse business revenue, and sanitation revenue.

After the convener finished reporting, Councilor Wang Xianqing reported that the Wine and Cuisine Association had petitioned to reduce the banquet tax from 20% to 10% and to only tax meals over 20,000 yuan. In addition, the Hotel Association also petitioned to exempt hotel tax. Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan explained that the council could decide to reduce the tax rate, but current banquet tax revenues reach 2 billion yuan per month. Cutting it in half would reduce it to 1 billion yuan, resulting in a 6 billion yuan shortfall for six months, which would have to be compensated for through other means. Director Gu also explained that the hotel tax was not mandated by the central government but decided by the Provisional Council. If the hotel tax is exempted, residents staying in hotels will not bear tax responsibilities.

Reports and Explanations from Each Group Convener

Subsequently, the conveners of each group reported and explained the increased budgets required for various facilities. After discussion by the review committee, a preliminary resolution was made: Regarding police affairs, it was requested that fire protection fees be increased by 1 billion yuan. Because fire protection is a major concern, the fire department has only purchased some leather belts since the victory. Therefore, in addition to the 500 million yuan already allocated for purchasing equipment, another 500 million yuan will be added.

The budget for the Housing Rental Committee is 13 million yuan (excluding living allowances). The Tenth Group Review Committee's convener and others do not support abolishing it and propose that an arbitration group should also be added. Because abolishing the committee and distributing severance pay would not help save money. However, some councilors believe that regardless of how much expense is saved, the organizations that should be cut must be abolished. The review result was to submit the decision to the general assembly.

Education and culture expenses account for 19.17% of the total budget, and the request to increase it to 25% was not approved. In addition, because private schools charge excessive tuition fees, subsidies will not be increased either. The Seventh Group requested that social relief, including women's relief, be increased by 900 million yuan. The review committee believes that Shanghai is full of wounds after the war, and social relief expenses only account for 1.56% of the total budget, which is too little. The provisional decision was to include it in the budget. Because engineering costs cannot be calculated temporarily, the public works and utilities expenses will be estimated in the future. The health expenses will still be handled according to the original budget.

Finally, the review committee's statistics show that in addition to the actual revenue and expenditure difference of 18.7 billion yuan, another 1.5 billion yuan of new budgets was added, requiring a total of 20.2 billion yuan. The solution for covering this amount will be determined by the mayor by deliberating on the five proposed tax levies. It was decisively advocated to abolish the sanitation donation. Because the horse racing donation is not yet determined, it is not included. A 4 billion yuan surcharge on public utilities was set because levying only 10% is easy and directly benefits municipal facilities, so it was agreed to. The remaining 16.2 billion yuan will need to be levied from either the housing tax (the proposal stipulates that 18 billion yuan is to be collected) or the municipal tax (the proposal stipulates that 15 billion yuan is to be collected). Currently, aside from the preliminary resolution of the Third Review Group to levy the municipal tax, the opinions of the councilors have not converged. The decision will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion. All of the review results from yesterday will also be submitted to the general assembly for a decision. The review meeting adjourned at 9:00 PM.

### Today's Agenda

This morning, the Municipal Council will hold its seventeenth meeting, and this afternoon, its eighteenth meeting. Both will continue to discuss proposals related to finance, industry, commerce, and the economy.

### Sideline Story at the Meeting

Yesterday morning, some merchants and citizens distributed leaflets accusing the treacherous monk De Wu Mi Jia of Jing'an Temple. In the afternoon, Shanghai Buddhists distributed a petition declaration to the Municipal Council opposing Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Department for violating laws.

The Shanghai Hotel and Business Association distributed two petitions, one requesting the cancellation of the hotel tax and the other requesting the improvement of the current salary system in the industry. The Wine and Cuisine Association also sent representatives to petition.

Qu Yue said, "The person who speaks last during a discussion is most likely to win. This is the secret to meetings. Please pay attention."

The deadline for reporting traitors was the most heated scene of yesterday's discussion. Feng Youzhen said, "If our country is still slowly dealing with traitors in one or two decades, wouldn't that be completely disgraceful?"

### Eight Hundred Monks Line Up to Petition; Request to Reconsider the Allocation of Temples

Before the Municipal Council meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss proposals, 800 representatives of monks from various temples in the city marched in a line and went to the Municipal Council meeting hall to petition, expressing dissatisfaction with the section "allocate or borrow temples" in proposal No. 3 on civil affairs discussed by the council regarding the municipal government allocating office space for autonomous organizations. These 800 monks also designated five monks, including Fu Shan and Bai Sheng, to represent them at the meeting. When the general assembly continued at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the chairman first reported the petition matters of the monks and hotel industry, and announced that the convener of the Civil Affairs Group would meet with the monks, and the Industry, Commerce, and Finance Group would meet with the hotel industry, to formulate opinions and submit them to the meeting for announcement. The monk representatives requested that the previously discussed Civil Affairs Proposal No. 3 be resubmitted for reconsideration. The receiving councilors accepted this request, and at around 4:00 PM, the 800 monks left in an orderly line.

According to Chen, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Department of the Police Bureau, speaking to a reporter from Hu Guang News Agency: Regarding the proposal submitted by Director Zhang Xiaosong at the council to allocate temples as office spaces for district public offices, legally, there is a basis, because the Ministry of Interior issued the Temple and Buddhist Management Regulations several years ago, which stipulated that temples can be allocated as office spaces for public utilities when necessary, and general lewd temples and monasteries can be confiscated and nationalized. Therefore, the Buddhist petitions, etc., are purely a matter of "knowing one thing but not knowing the other."

### Lively Debate with Heated Arguments at the Council; Resolution to Set a Deadline for Reporting Traitors Passed; Seven Methods Decided to Request Central Government Adoption and Implementation; Supporters Dominated with Eighty Votes

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its fifteenth meeting yesterday morning to continue a heated debate on Civil Affairs Proposal No. 15, "Proposal to Request the Central Government to Thoroughly Investigate and Report Traitors within a Deadline, Punish Them According to Law, and Publicly Investigate and Try Those Who Have Been Reported or Are Already in Custody, to Uphold National Law and Appease Public Anger." The focus remained on the issue of setting a deadline. Councilors were clearly divided into two camps: supporters and opponents, with both sides engaging in heated arguments of equal intensity. The supporters even proposed revising the methods and adding additional opinions.

The pioneer who fired the first shot in the supporter camp was Jiang Huaishu, who, as a lawyer, explained that supporting the deadline was not to facilitate traitors but to expedite the reporting process. He said, "We fought for eight years in the Anti-Japanese War. Would we defend traitors? Since my business recovered, I have never accepted a case defending a traitor."

Accountant Xu Yongzuo valued the law, advocating for passing the original proposal but requiring it to go through the legislative process and not be issued by order.

To strengthen the effect of his speech, Feng Youzhen specially walked onto the stage and requested the chairman to give him one or two more minutes in advance. He said, "After the victory, the government was not active enough or thorough enough in handling traitor cases, so I advocate setting a deadline to speed up the process. Look at the situation in France. Major traitors such as Pétain and Laval were sentenced and prosecuted immediately after the war ended, and the remaining minor traitors were also judged and executed. China is still investigating now. What will happen if this continues indefinitely? Furthermore, many traitors often transform themselves into underground workers. If this drags on, the traitors may even receive medals." He submitted six revised methods to the assembly for discussion.

Wang Yansong specifically mentioned the "chaos" that Tao Baichuan spoke of last week. He said that reporting traitors is also too chaotic, and setting a deadline can stabilize people's hearts.

Tong Xiang supplemented Feng Youzhen's opinion, proposing that the central investigation agency assist in the reporting.

The Opponent Camp Begins to Speak

The first general in the opponent camp, He Chengfu, spoke eloquently. The bell for the time limit rang three times, but he was still not satisfied. The chairman asked him not to make irrelevant remarks and gave him another minute of grace. His opinions were more trivial, the main idea being that setting a deadline seemed to benefit traitors. The council should represent the majority of the public, otherwise, it will be criticized by "reactionaries." He said that the traitors in the Northeast have not yet been reported, and also said that Qin Hui's descendants had requested the puppet government to destroy the iron statue. Finally, he said that only traitors frame the loyal and good, not the loyal and good frame traitors.

Wang Liben refuted Wang Yansong's statement about stabilizing people's hearts, saying, "The common people will not be uneasy, only the traitors will be uneasy. As for whether the reporting work is expedited, it does not depend on whether there is a deadline."

Jia Dechao's opinion was similar to He Chengfu's, and he also believed that if the council passed the deadline for reporting, it was feared that there would be suspicion or criticism from the outside world.

Zhong Yuliang Speaks in a Strange Voice

Zhong Yuliang also came to oppose in a strange voice, but the reasons he gave were somewhat irrelevant. He divided the traitors into three types: one type is originally rich and is still a wealthy old man, one type is originally a pauper and is now a wealthy old man, and another type is originally a pauper and is still a pauper.

Chen Cunren also refuted the statement that setting a deadline for reporting can stabilize people's hearts. He intended to talk at length about what a traitor is, but the chairman told him that the regulations already stipulated this and there was no need to say it.

When announcing the end of the discussion, Gong Yuting insisted on speaking once, believing that the situation in China cannot be compared to that in France, and that traitors hiding in remote rural areas should also be reported as much as possible.

Finally, the chairman put the two opposing opinions of supporting the deadline and opposing the deadline to a vote. The atmosphere returned from tension to serenity, and the supporter camp won with a majority of eighty votes (124 people were present).

Seven Methods Discussed and Passed

The principle of setting a deadline was decided. The methods were then discussed in detail. Based on the six points proposed by Feng Youzhen, deleted and revised, and added two supplementary points by Tong Xiang and Lu Lushi, the final decided methods totaled seven points:

(1) It is proposed to request the central government to determine the deadline for reporting traitors.

(2) It is proposed to request the central government to announce the real names and aliases of personnel who participated in the puppet government due to underground work in the recovered areas during the period of occupation, to prevent traitors from using the excuse of doing underground work to try to exonerate themselves when they are prosecuted.

(3) If a reported traitor has significant evidence of guilt and fails to appear after being summoned, an arrest warrant should be issued immediately.

(4) Traitors who have been reported should be dealt with as soon as possible, and major traitors should not be lenient.

(5) Traitors who have been sentenced should be executed as soon as possible.

(6) Please ask the central government's agency responsible for investigating traitors to promptly announce the names of traitors who have not yet been reported and submit their crimes to the local court for reference in the investigation.

(7) It is proposed to request the central government to order all agencies and organizations to be responsible for reporting traitors in similar institutions during the puppet organization period and to reward people for confidential reports.

Two Interludes: Temporary Motions

After the methods were passed, there were two interludes: (1) Zhan Wenhuan had some additional opinions as a temporary motion, believing that whether supporting or opposing, the purpose was to strengthen the reporting. Therefore, he advocated that the council conduct a general reporting at the second meeting. As a result, due to time constraints, it was not discussed in the morning. (2) After a ten-minute break, when the meeting continued, Tao Baichuan suddenly requested a reconsideration of the first method, believing that this provision was too general. Legally, there is a 20-year statute of limitations for reporting criminal offenders. If the municipal government shortens the reporting deadline for traitors too much, wouldn't that be too lenient for the traitors? He advocated retaining Feng Youzhen's original proposal that was deleted during the discussion, "Military traitors, political traitors, and secret agent traitors who harm the people are not subject to the deadline," but the supporters were few and the reconsideration failed.

### Suggesting the Government Speedily Improve Financial Policies; Decision to Send Representatives to Petition in the Capital; Assembly Discussed Proposals Yesterday and Passed Five Temporary Motions

Yesterday afternoon, the Council continued to discuss Finance Proposals Nos. 4 to 10 and passed five temporary motions.

Finance Proposal No. 4 is "Suggesting that the government speedily improve financial policies, actively handle production loans and rural loans, suppress the high interest rates of the black market, to reduce costs, stabilize prices, and relieve the difficulties of industry and commerce, to avoid economic collapse." The assembly decided to pass it, forwarding it to the municipal government for submission to the central government for speedy and practical implementation. Tao Baichuan believed that a single official document would be difficult to achieve significant results and suggested sending representatives to petition in the capital. The assembly passed this and decided to send eleven representatives. As for the selection of representatives, it was resolved that the speaker would first draft a list of names and submit it to the assembly for voting today.

Finance Proposal No. 5 is "To commemorate the second anniversary of the victory, it is proposed to hold an international industrial exhibition in Shanghai on September 3 next year."

Preventing Banks and Money Shops from Paying Out Deficient Currency

Finance Proposal No. 6, the reason for the case is "Please order the municipal government to instruct the Bankers Association and Money Shop Association to take effective measures to prevent banks and money shops from paying out deficient currency to avoid disputes." The review opinion was "It is proposed to request the speaker to send a letter to the commercial associations of the banking and money industries in this city to notify members to pay close attention." The assembly passed it without objection.

Finance Proposal No. 7, the reason for the case was revised to "Request the municipal government to forward it to the Ministry of Finance that the original regulations for restricting imported goods be strictly implemented and that the import tax for the foreign goods applied for import should be adjusted appropriately to maintain the national industry." The assembly decided to pass it in principle.

Factories Expedite Commencement of Work

Finance Proposal No. 8 is a re-submission of an old case from the Provisional Council, requesting the central government to expedite the commencement of work in the enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over and to encourage private factories to resume operations to accommodate unemployed workers and increase production. It was resolved to pass it.

Finance Proposal No. 9 concerns reforming the insurance system for employees of financial institutions, suggesting the adoption of a special cash guarantee system. Because the methods stipulated that colleagues related to the position should be jointly penalized after an employee's embezzlement case occurs, Qu Yue and Jiang Huaishu, etc., believed that this was inappropriate, and there were questions about the point that "a security deposit should be paid in the amount of three times the monthly salary." The assembly decided to temporarily retain this case and hand it over to the Fourth and Tenth Groups to jointly review it.

Finance Proposal No. 10 is to approve the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's official letter, suggesting to the municipal government to forward the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's petition matters to the central government for speedy implementation. The assembly decided to pass it and handle it together with Proposal No. 4.

Proceeds from the Sale of Enemy Property; Allocated for the Construction of Shanghai

Discuss five temporary motions. (1) Proposed by Jin Runxiang et al., "In order to protect workers' lives and stabilize social order, it is proposed to present it to the central government for approval to designate a national bank to hold unemployment insurance for workers' groups." Passed without objection. (2) Zhan Wenhuan proposed that the council conduct a general reporting of traitors in this city. The assembly decided to reject this, believing that there was no need for the council to set up another agency. Later, Speaker Pan proposed to make a resolution: "Notify all councilors to report traitors as quickly as possible to the best of their knowledge." The entire audience applauded and passed. (3) Proposed by Jiang Hao et al., "It is proposed to request the municipal government to give priority to employing loyal comrades of this city who have suffered hardships, to comfort loyalty." It was resolved to pass it. (4) Proposed by Jin Runxiang et al., to set a deadline for all agencies illegally occupying civilian houses to move out. It was resolved to pass it. (5) Two cases were combined. One was proposed by Jiang Huaishu et al., requesting the central government to allocate 50% of the funds from the sale of the enemy and puppet property by the Shanghai District of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for the construction of culture and industry in this city. The proposal of Tao Baichuan et al. was to allocate 10%, but Tao ultimately endorsed the former proposal. The assembly decided to pass it. The meeting adjourned.

### Discussing the Thorough Investigation of Real Estate Companies; Laughs and Jokes Emerge Amidst the Tension; The Outcome of a Verbal Battle is Willingness to Retain the Case

After the break, the financial proposals were discussed. The first case was proposed by Chen Gongda, suggesting a thorough investigation of the personnel organization and capital sources of various real estate companies established during the enemy and puppet period. During the discussion, "laughs and jokes emerged amidst the tension."

First of all, the review committee's opinion on this case was to temporarily retain it and request the original proposer to provide facts. In the assembly, Chen Gongda presented the facts, saying that as long as the Land Administration Bureau and the Social Bureau thoroughly investigated the capital of the enemy, puppet, and treacherous individuals in the real estate companies, the truth would come out. It is understood that more than 75% of the owners are no longer the owners from before the war, and he specifically cited the name of a company.

However, Zhang Xuelian stood up and advocated for the withdrawal of this case, believing that enemy and puppet properties already had a specialized agency to handle them, and there was no need to raise this case.

The chairman asked if anyone seconded the withdrawal. Jin Runxiang raised his hand to second, but Zhang Zhihan stood up and said, "I don't second it!" The chairman laughed and said, "I am asking if there is a second, and those who do not second do not need to say it." The whole audience burst into laughter.

After the laughter, the atmosphere returned to tension. Chen Gongda stood up with a stern expression, saying, "Does anyone advocating withdrawal have a relationship with the real estate company? If there is a relationship, they should recuse themselves." But his words did not elicit a response.

The chairman put the motion to withdraw to a vote, but only 37 votes were in favor, and it failed.

Qu Yue expressed his opinion, saying, "I personally have no relationship with real estate companies, but I do not support harassing the people."

Zhang Xuelian also said, "If we are to conduct a thorough investigation, it is not just real estate companies, but all companies must be investigated."

Many others expressed their opinions. Some opposed the principle, while others quibbled over textual revisions, and the situation was quite chaotic.

When the chairman decided to put the motion to reject this case to a vote, Zhang Zhihan again made the audience laugh. He said, "Hasn't the reason for the case already been passed?" The chairman said, "It has not been passed. Withdrawal is one thing, and rejection is another."

As a result of the vote, only 47 votes were in favor of rejection, and it did not pass. Therefore, the discussion turned to how to revise it.

There was much debate on how to revise it, with some people speaking several times in a row. Lu Yinchu couldn't stand it and suddenly stood up, holding the rules of procedure in one hand, and shouted loudly, "Please pay attention, according to the rules of procedure, each person may not speak more than twice!"

Finally, a revised proposal was finally summarized, but only a few were in favor when it was put to a vote.

Withdrawal, not passed. Rejection, not passed. Revision, not passed either. The chairman said with a smile: This case can only be proposed to be retained.

The councilors all laughed and raised their hands in the laughter to decide the fate of this case to be retained.

During the remaining time in the morning, two more proposals were discussed. The second case was to reclaim the power of foreign patents, such as British and French commercial power companies, water plants, and public buses, and retain it to be discussed in conjunction with the proposals of the Fifth Group. The third case was revised to plan for the construction of civilian shopping centers in each district and to re-designate stall areas to rectify the city's appearance. The assembly decided to pass it in principle and send it to the municipal government for forwarding to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for handling.

### 盆湯弄橋梅閘橋　工務局招標承修

The Public Works Bureau招标 for repairs to Péntāngnòng Bridge and Méizhág Bridge.

[Report from our newspaper] To improve traffic in the central district, the relevant bureaus have repeatedly consulted and reviewed the implementation plan, and the situation is gradually improving. However, there are still several points that the reporter learned from the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau, as follows: (1) The penalties in the "Implementation Measures for Improving Traffic in the Central District" are only applicable to the central district. Other districts will still be handled in accordance with the management regulations for various vehicles. (2) For those who do not park in accordance with the regulations, the police will record the license number and report it to the branch bureau, which will notify the violator of the penalty. The license will no longer be confiscated. (3) The ban on freight trucks on Beijing East Road does not apply to private passenger cars and motorized delivery vans that are not carrying goods. In order to facilitate north-south traffic on the Suzhou Creek and reduce vehicle congestion on other bridges, it is necessary to open the Péntāngnòng Bridge and Lǎozhá Bridge. The Public Works Bureau will solicit bids for repairs, which will be completed in February, and then they can be officially opened to traffic. As for the plan to convert Míng Yuan Road and Yuánmíngyuán Road into one-way traffic, and how to improve the surface of the Waibaidu Bridge, the Public Works Bureau will conduct a detailed study before making a decision.

### 市府接收車輛修理　查有勾串舞弊嫌疑　清查團移法院偵查

A Clean-Up Team Transfers the Case to the Court for Investigation: Suspicions of Collusion and Malpractice Found in the Municipal Government's Acceptance of Vehicle Repairs

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the suspected malpractice in the Municipal Government's General Affairs Department's acceptance of enemy and puppet vehicles, after an investigation by the Clean-Up Team, it was believed that the personnel handling the matter in the Municipal Government colluded with the Wàntài Repair Factory in fraudulent activities. The Clean-Up Team resolved at its eighth meeting to transfer all case files to the District Court Prosecutor's Office this morning for handling in accordance with the law. The complete set of documents includes (1) the General Report of the Shanghai Municipal Government on Receiving and Handling Enemy and Puppet Materials, and the report form related to vehicles in the Report on Receiving Enemy and Puppet Vehicle Oil and Parts, a total of six documents; (2) a signed report from Shī Bāngruì, Director of the General Affairs Department, one document; (3) a contract between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Wàntài Repair Factory, one document; (4) an investigation report from the Clean-Up Team, one document.

Three Hundred Secret Letters, More Than One Hundred Already Investigated

According to Zhāng Zhīběn, head of the Receiving and Investigation Team, more than one hundred of the over three hundred secret letters received have already been investigated and are currently being sorted. If any criminal acts are confirmed, they will be handed over to the judicial authorities for prosecution. Three secret letter cases were discussed at the Clean-Up Team meeting the day before yesterday, but for the sake of thorough investigation, they will not be publicly released for the time being, and will be publicly announced after the review is completed. He also stated that the targets of the Clean-Up Team's investigation are the Executive Yuan and its affiliated agencies, and the main goal is to focus on the matter rather than the individuals involved.

### 管理汽車加油站　市政會議通過辦法

### 沿蘇州河黃浦江　全部潮門已修竣

All Tidal Gates Along the Suzhou Creek and Huangpu River Have Been Repaired

[Report from our newspaper] The terrain of this city is low-lying. During high tides, the tide water flows back into the ditches, and lower road surfaces, such as the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road, the section of Guangdong Road from Jiangxi Road to Sichuan Road, and the area near Risheng Building, are often flooded during heavy rains. In the past, the Public Concession established tidal gates at the outlets of various ditches to prevent tidal water from flowing back, but they have become ineffective due to years of disrepair. Now, the Public Works Bureau has repaired all the tidal gates along both banks of the Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River from Hongkou Creek to the coast of Zhengzheng Road, as well as the western part of Hongkou Creek, for a total of one hundred and sixty-four tidal gates. The first phase of the project was completed at the end of August. Within the scope of the effectiveness of the rebuilt tidal gates in the first phase, there is no more water accumulation on the low-lying roads. However, at the culvert outlet of the tidal gate north of the Laji Bridge on Zhejiang Road, after the tidal gate is closed, the tidal water cannot flow in, so it overflows from the well and floods the road surface. The Public Works Bureau plans to build another tidal gate at the Suzhou Creek outlet to prevent this. Also, the section of Suzhou Road and North Suzhou Road west of Zhejiang Road has banks that are too low, and the water overflows the top of the bank during high tides. Therefore, it is necessary to raise the road surface or the banks, but due to the large scale of the project and limited funding, it is feared that construction will be difficult at present. As for Julu Road, Maoming South Road, Changle Road, and Shaanxi South Road in the former French Concession, there is still a phenomenon of tidal water flowing back, which is caused by the Zhaojiabang River. The Public Works Bureau is currently building a gate dam and pumping station at the Rihui port of Zhaojiabang River, and has begun to build a tidal gate project at the junction of the former French Concession and the South City. After the completion of the above projects, the phenomenon of water accumulation in this city can be greatly improved.

### 地院遷法營房　市長尤爲設法

The Mayor is Making Every Effort to Move the District Court to the French Barracks

[Report from our newspaper] After the war, the Shanghai District Court has been working with the High Court in the same building on North Zhejiang Road. The address is small, and the affairs are extremely busy. Even the courtrooms are not enough. There has long been a discussion about moving out. It was recently rumored that the Municipal Government has agreed to find a way to give the French military barracks on Lǐlù Road to the court, but it has not been realized due to some property disputes. According to news from the District Court, Mayor Wú is extremely busy because the Municipal Council is currently in session, so he has expressed that after the Municipal Council closes, he will definitely work hard for the District Court, and even if he cannot "allocate" it, he must at least enable the District Court to "lease" the site to meet urgent needs. It is said that Xiè, the Minister of the Judicial Administration Department, is also very concerned about this matter and is eager to find a solution as soon as possible. Therefore, the District Court's move is almost inevitable. The new site is closer to the District Prosecutor's Office and the detention center, which can also be much more convenient for work.

### 輪船業招待軍警當局　商碼頭治安辦法　宣鐵吾表示決取締惡劣風氣　嚴密防止盜竊物資非法組織

The Shipping Industry Hosted Military and Police Authorities to Discuss Security Measures for Docks. Xuan Tiewu stated that he is determined to eliminate the bad atmosphere and strictly prevent the theft of materials and illegal organizations.

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, in order to thoroughly eradicate theft at ports and docks, hosted the responsible persons of the military and police authorities of this city at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon to discuss security measures for Shanghai's waterway docks and warehouses. Xuan Tiewu, Xu Xueyu, Yu Shuping, Zhang Jinzhi, Tao Yishan, and others attended, as well as more than 50 representatives from various shipping companies. The meeting was chaired by Yang Guanbei. After the meeting, the chairman first reported: I hope that the phenomenon of theft in docks and warehouses can be completely eradicated in the future. Then Commander Xuan gave a speech, stating in brief: At present, the police bureau has drafted two measures to eliminate this bad atmosphere: (1) Strictly prevent organizations such as the "Thirty-Six Gang," the "Scalper Gang," and illegal organizations engaged in stealing materials, such as the so-called "Patrolman Company" and "Insurance Company," to eliminate theft. (2) When barges transport materials, they should pay close attention to order to avoid petty criminals from taking the opportunity to act. As for the Municipal Government, in order to improve the bad atmosphere of Shanghai's ports, it has recently organized a "Port Management Committee." Its organization can be divided into three departments: (1) the administrative department, which is responsible for problems such as the repair and reconstruction of warehouses and docks, is responsible by the Public Utilities Bureau; (2) the organization of dock stevedores is managed by the Social Affairs Bureau; (3) the order of ports and docks is maintained by the Municipal Police Bureau. Each agency has taken up its duties and is stepping up rectification. The waterway security problem will be turned around soon. Later, Xu Xueyu, on behalf of the shipping industry, presented a banner to Commander Xuan to express his respect.

### 恢復港口秩序　呈請劃分警權

Restore Port Order, Request for Division of Police Power

The association telegraphed President Song, Minister Yu, and Mayor Wu yesterday, respectively, requesting a division of waterway police power in order to improve port order. The original telegram is as follows: "President Song of the Executive Yuan, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications, and Mayor Wu of Shanghai: Since the restoration, theft on the Huangpu River in Shanghai has been rampant, and dock order has also been chaotic. The key to resolving the problem is that the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department have failed to reasonably divide their powers and responsibilities, forming a special area where neither party is responsible, leading to many abuses. This association is deeply anxious about the Shanghai crisis. We dare to presume to request Your Excellencies to clearly stipulate the scope of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department's authority. All responsibilities for land and water security within the Shanghai urban area should be borne by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in order to unify authority and eliminate theft. The reputation of the Port of Shanghai depends on this. We sincerely suggest that you approve and respond. President Du Yong of the full title is respectfully."

### 敵偽時期一「紅人」　潘三省判七年　高院傳訊謝葆生妻　因有隱匿產罪嫌

A "Big Shot" During the Enemy-Puppet Period, Pān Sānxǐng, Sentenced to Seven Years; High Court Summons Xie Baosheng's Wife for Concealing Assets

[Report from our newspaper] Pān Sānxǐng, a "big shot" in Shanghai during the enemy-puppet period who organized the puppet Gold Exchange Association, the puppet Lianyi Bank, the puppet Football Federation, the Asian General Assembly, the Chinese General Assembly, and the Zhaofeng Club, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, deprived of public rights for seven years, and all of his property was confiscated except for a discretionary amount to leave necessary living expenses for his family.

The High Court also concluded the cases of suspected traitors Eitobron and Zhu Changsheng, Wei Shanfu, etc., who were military commentators and intelligence officers for the German Embassy's XGRS radio station. The sentences are scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 26th of this month. Xie Baosheng, a "gangster" who opened the Xianshali Dance Palace, Kader Bathhouse, and Xinzha Hotel in this city, was arrested after the victory and has been sentenced to two and a half years by the High Court for having served as the Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Police Department during the enemy-puppet period. Now his wife, Xie Zhu, and others are suspected of concealing property, and have been prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office in accordance with Articles 28 and 29 of the Criminal Law and Article 12 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. They were tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon.

It is reported that after Xie Baosheng was detained by the Military Intelligence Bureau, Xie Zhu, fearing the confiscation of his property, telephoned Wang Chaoliang, the manager of Xie's Xinzha Hotel, in October of last year, asking him to transfer the movable property, such as redwood furniture, from Xie's residence on Weihaiwei Road and Changping Road to the home of Dai Buxiang, the manager of the Grand China Hotel, his children's in-laws, for storage. The next day, Dai learned of the matter and, fearing accidents, ordered it to be moved out. Xie Zhu and others then moved the property to a rented house on Rue Massenet and concealed it, but it was discovered by the responsible authorities, sealed up, and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of concealing rebel property. Yesterday, the defendants were summoned to court for questioning. Xie Zhu claimed that the property was her personal property. Xie's eldest son, Xie Wenyuan (at large), had served as the captain of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and the puppet Yangzhou Taxation Bureau. The High Court asked his mother about his whereabouts yesterday. Xie Zhu said that he often went out to do business, and the details of his puppet positions were unknown. She did not know where he was now. The court adjourned the case for a retrial.

In addition, the cases of suspected traitors Bu Jixiang, Ren Yongkang, Xu Senfu, and others were investigated once yesterday and were adjourned for a retrial.

[Another report] The High Prosecutor's Office prosecuted Zhou Fenggang and Gao Linsen on suspicion of being traitors.

American Reporter Accused: District Court Consulted the Judicial Administration Department; Opening an Investigation Does Not Necessarily Mean Acceptance

[Report from our newspaper] The German, Shen Ke, is suspected of participating in the Nazi international spy organization, the Ohad Bureau, and has been arrested by the US military, as reported in this newspaper. After learning of this news, Randal, a reporter for the Associated Press of America, reported it in detail. Unexpectedly, Shen Ke believed that Randal had deliberately slandered him and filed a lawsuit with the District Court. Randal immediately stated that the Chinese court should not accept the lawsuit of a person with the suspicion of war crimes from an enemy country and asked the court to dismiss the case. All sectors of the city are paying close attention to the legal issues of this case, and reporters are also concerned about the future of this case and its great impact on reporting news in the future. According to the person in charge of a judicial organ in this city, the opening of an investigation by the court does not necessarily mean that it has been accepted. Our country is still in a state of war with Germany, so there are indeed legal problems in this case. The District Court had already conducted a thorough study of the case and consulted the Judicial Administration Department, but has not yet received a reply.

[Our Newspaper's Report] J.B. Powell, the former editor of the "China Weekly Review," an English-language journal in this city, was one of the most vehement critics of the enemy and puppet regime in the past.

After the outbreak of the war, he was imprisoned by the enemy's military police at the New Asia Hotel and suffered severe mistreatment, with one leg eventually becoming disabled due to frostbite. Recently, he went to Japan at the invitation of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal to testify. Powell was eager to see China after its victory and meet with his old friends whom he had not seen for many years. He originally planned to visit China after completing his testimony. Unexpectedly, although his health was still good before leaving Japan, he suddenly suffered a severe heart attack after several testimonies. Doctors advised him to return to the US immediately for treatment, so the trip to China had to be cancelled. Powell has now decided to follow the doctor's advice and return to the US on a hospital ship. His son, J.W. Powell, who is currently editing the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai, has decided to fly to Japan today to meet with his father.

### Female Corpse Found in Soil Well with Trousers Wrapped Around Neck Five Times; Young Woman Murdered; Paramour Flees Without a Trace; Cause No More Than Love Triangle

Small Shoemaker's Cry Causes Commotion Among Residents of Yinghua Lane

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Shouzhen, 33 years old, from Suqian, worked as a boiler attendant in the tiger stove run by Wu Wangshi in Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, seven years ago. At that time, he met a woman from Changshu named Xiaoman, 23 years old, and they began living together. Later, they moved back to their hometown. Three years later, they returned to Shanghai, but Wang could not find a business and his finances were tight. Wang Shouzhen then went to work for the puppet security team in Changshu with a fellow villager (name unknown). After the victory, Wang brought Xiaoman back to Shanghai and had her stay at the home of his fellow villager, Wu Wangshi (3883 Daxu Lane, Changshou Road). Xiaoman now works as a female worker in the 13th Textile Factory. Wang himself went to Hangzhou to work, but because his income was still insufficient, he returned to Shanghai on the 17th of this month and stayed at Wu Wangshi's place for one night. The next day, at 3:00 PM, Wang accompanied Xiaoman to the home of his fellow villager, Hu Zhiren, at 1780 Yinghua Lane, Robert Sheng Road. Hu is a worker at the China Textile Company. Wang mentioned that the cost of living in Shanghai was high and difficult to maintain, and he planned to return to Suqian with his family. That night, Wang and Xiaoman stayed in a small room outside the back door of Hu's house. (Note: This lane is a dead end). To everyone's surprise, at around 6:30 AM yesterday morning, Bao Genbao (16 years old), a leather shoe apprentice from Yangzhou in the same lane, went to a soil well in the lane to draw water and suddenly saw two feet pointing upwards in the well. He shouted loudly, and soon the residents of the lane gathered and tried to retrieve the body. It was a young woman with a five-foot-long waistband wrapped around her neck five times. She had short hair, wore a sweat vest inside, white shorts, a short red-striped shirt, and gauze socks. Her nails were painted red. Later, Hu Zhiren identified the deceased as Xiaoman and, together with the Baojia, reported it to the Putuo Road Branch. Chief Qi of the branch ordered Deputy Chief Teng Yongxi, along with Judicial Section Chief Ying Zhensan and police officers Zhang Xiaolin and Zhao Yongji, to rush to the scene for investigation. Wang Shouzhen had already fled without a trace. A pair of Xiaoman's red cloth shoes were found outside the nearby wall. After the body was photographed, because there were no family members, the Pushan Villa was notified to collect it for burial. After receiving a report from his subordinates, Chief Qi of the branch, because the case involved a death, prepared a document overnight ordering police officers Zhang Xiaolin and Zhao Yongji to rush to Changshu to investigate the deceased's family and arrest the murderer for investigation. According to the investigating police officer, Xiaoman had been working in Shanghai for several months and may have had a lover, so she was unwilling to return to Suqian with Wang Shouzhen. Wang, in a moment of anger, killed the woman and threw her into the well. It was also found that the murderer, Wang Shouzhen, is five feet seven inches tall, with a rectangular face, and his hair is combed back. He wears a blue striped shirt and pants, and black cloth shoes.

### SS Tjilata of Java China Japan Lijn Refuses Passengers to Xiamen

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, there were originally eight foreign ships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai, but only the SS Scheldersveld of Java China Japan Lijn, the SS Promethues of Jardine Matheson, and the SS Siam of Blue Funnel Line, and Yu Wan Ni arrived. The others were not seen. According to the United States President Lines, the SS President Jefferson is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning, and the SS Hastings of Wa Lun & Co. has been postponed to tomorrow.

### Mao Yisheng Discusses Construction of the Pudong Bridge; Difficulty in Raising Funds; Tunnel-Style Project is Huge; Will Take About Three Years to Complete

[Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter recently interviewed Mao Yisheng, the head of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, to inquire about the construction of the Pudong Bridge, which was strongly advocated by the councilors at the Municipal Council meeting, and other related issues. According to Fang, one of the most difficult aspects of building this bridge at present is how to raise funds. After the bridge is completed, the bridge itself will be able to generate income, and the construction costs can be gradually repaid. In foreign countries, the cost of building a bridge is never borne by the government. In terms of engineering, because there are many ships entering and leaving the Huangpu River, the tunnel type is more suitable. However, this type of tunnel project is more extensive and will take about three years to complete.

Secretary Liang of the Planning Group States That Tanggu, Qingdao, and Shanghai Ports Should Be Built First

According to Liang Bogao, the chief secretary of the group, the group has completed its inspection of railways and highways south of the Great Wall, except for the communist areas. In terms of seaports, the group has inspected all ports along the coast from Huludao in the north to Hainan Island in the south, except for Dalian, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, and has prepared reports and submitted them to the Executive Yuan. The group believes that the ports that should be built first are Tanggu, Qingdao, and Shanghai, followed by Qinhuangdao, Huludao, etc. The opening of a new port in Guangzhou Bay is also a goal that the group values.

Railway Repair; Change of Plan; Restoration to Begin in Areas with Good Security

In terms of railways, the damage in South and Central China is more severe than in North China. The railways in North China suffered very little damage at the time of the victory and were originally scheduled to be repaired first. However, after the victory, the communist army harassed and destroyed transportation everywhere, and there was no guarantee of security, so the plan has now been changed to begin restoring the railways in areas with good security. The Zhe-Gan Railway has been damaged by more than 90%. The Pingxiang-Zhuzhou section and the Zhuji-Jinhua section have already started construction and are planned to be repaired first. The group has also designed a third north-south trunk line in addition to the Ping-Han, Yue-Han, and Jin-Pu lines, from Lanzhou, via Chengdu, Chongqing, using the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway to Liuzhou, and extending to Guangzhou Bay. As for highways, the transportation capacity is poor. Given the current national economic difficulties and the fact that the old railways have not yet been repaired, they can only maintain the status quo and wait for future development.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

We are writing to you on behalf of our client, China IYi Feng Company, regarding a news item titled "New Guang Theater Accuses Ticket Recipient of Being a Thief" published in the Shen Bao on September 16. According to the article, the so-called cotton cloth merchant Huang Juren claimed that the earpiece fell off and there was no sound. However, all the earpiece plugs of our company are equipped with spring locks that cannot be opened without a key. Unless the lock spring is forcibly broken, it is impossible for them to fall off on their own. A trial listening session on the spot revealed that the earpiece was clear and undamaged. His statement is obviously untrue. Furthermore, if he did not want to listen, why did he place it on his lap and cover it with his bag, making his suspicion even more obvious. Our company's earpieces have been stolen many times, so we had no choice but to report the case according to regulations. Moreover, because the person was well-dressed, we did not want to pursue the matter further. The news report is quite inconsistent with the truth and may cause misunderstandings among theatergoers. We request that you correct the report on our behalf. We respectfully request that you review this letter and publish it.

Sincerely,

Lawyer Gu Kenfu

Regarding the article "Yutong Manufacturing Company Manager Defrauds" published in your newspaper on September 14, which states that the manager "owns a building at No. 24 Zhianfang, North Sichuan Road," this is completely inconsistent with the facts. The house was jointly rented by myself and Mr. Lin from Gonghe Real Estate Company (a lease is available for verification). Later, because my family had not yet arrived, the house was entirely entrusted to Mr. Lin's family for care. Afterwards, Mr. Lin lent it to a Mr. Hu for temporary residence. Last month, my family came to Shanghai and moved into the house. We are currently urging Mr. Hu to move out one room of the borrowed building as soon as possible. The fraud manager Wu Gengxin was arrested in the house, presumably residing in Mr. Hu's room. This matter concerns my rights and interests, and I am truly afraid of misunderstandings. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction. Yang Fangshi

### Science News; US Uses Vibration Meter to Measure Elephant Steps; And Invents Electric Weed Killer

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] News from the China Society of Natural Sciences: (1) Although elephants are large, their steps are very light. Recently, the US General Electric Company used a vibration meter to measure the vibration frequency of elephant steps as three mils per second and the vibration frequency of lion steps as twelve mils per second. (2) Mr. Gibbs of the United States recently invented an electric weed killer that looks like a plow rake, with copper electrodes as rake teeth that conduct high-voltage, low-current electricity. The machine is towed by a jeep. Where it passes, the weeds are electrocuted, and all are burned to death from the leaves to the roots, making them unable to regenerate. Using this method to kill weeds costs ten US dollars per acre. However, the yield of American agriculture and the value of land can reduce losses of 500 million US dollars per year.

The discussion resulted in a decision that, starting today (the 20th), personnel from the Military Police Corps and the Police Bureau will be dispatched, in conjunction with household registration personnel from various districts, carrying investigation forms, to conduct investigations in various districts.

### District Offices Must Fully Mobilize for Household Reregistration and Record Transcription

The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday sent letters to the district offices stating that the initial household registration is the basic work for implementing the Household Registration Law, and future household administration in this city will be based on this. Therefore, all efforts must be made for the household reregistration and record transcription in various districts. It is stipulated that district offices should have at least half of the assistant staff participate in the household administration work during the household reregistration, record transcription, and household statistics period. Other staff should also be concentrated and used to assist in household administration work at any time. After the initial household registration is completed, this bureau will conduct a strict assessment based on (1) whether the household reregistration work is accurate and without error; (2) whether the record transcription work and data compilation are serious and prompt; and (3) whether the district office personnel are fully mobilized. This will be an important criterion for evaluating district chiefs and deputy district chiefs.

Each Bao to Engrave Fee-Charged Wooden Stamps

The ages listed in this form are based on whether the birth month and day have passed on the date of the investigation. If the date of birth has not yet passed on the date of the investigation, then one year must be subtracted. For example, if a child was born on May 3, 1945, and the investigation is conducted in September of this year, the date of birth has already passed, and the child's actual age is one year old (one-year-old population includes the population under two years old). If the child was born on October 8, 1939, and the investigation is conducted in September of this year, the year of birth listed on the form is 7 years old. However, since the date of birth has not yet passed on the date of the investigation, one year is subtracted, and the actual age is 6 years old (the 6-year-old population includes those under seven years old).

It is incorrect to fill in "Zhenru." If someone is from Nanxun, Wuxing, Zhejiang, they should fill in "Wuxing, Zhejiang." It is incorrect to fill in "Nanxun, Zhejiang." Another example is "Wu County, Jiangsu." It is incorrect to fill in "Suzhou, Jiangsu."

6.  Registered Residence: If a non-local resident has a registered residence in this city, fill in "this city." If there is another registered residence, fill in the province, county, or city of the registered residence. Local residents or those who do not have a registered residence elsewhere and do not have a registered residence in this city should draw a diagonal line.

7.  Marital Status: For those who are married, there are three options: "Married," "Widowed," and "Divorced," which can be filled in according to the actual situation. Those who are unmarried should fill in "Unmarried." However, those who have not reached the age of marriage (under 18 for males and under 16 for females) do not need to fill in this section. If someone has not reached the age of marriage but is already married, they should still fill in the information according to their married status.

8.  Educational Level: All those who are 6 years old or older must fill in this section. Those under 6 years old do not need to fill in this section. However, if someone under 6 years old is already attending school, they should still fill in the information according to their actual situation. The filling method is as follows: (1) Higher Education: This includes all those who have graduated from or are attending universities or specialized schools equivalent to universities. Graduates should fill in their department of study, such as "Liberal Arts University," "Law University," "Normal University," "Medical School," etc. Undergraduates should indicate the number of years of study, such as "Liberal Arts University 2" (meaning a second-year student in the liberal arts department of the university), "Law University 2," "Normal University 2," "Medical School 2," etc. (2) Secondary Education: This includes all those who have graduated from or are attending middle schools of various levels or specialized schools equivalent to middle schools.

### Ministry of Finance Explains: No Limit on Overdraft Amount, No Need for Mandatory Guarantees; Instructs Banking Industry to Understand Original Intent of Laws

[Our Reporter] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, along with the guilds of towel blankets, inner cotton weaving, hand-made cotton weaving, sock machines, dyeing, handkerchief weaving, and general merchandise businesses, jointly requested the Ministry of Finance to retract the order requiring contracts and limits for overdraft accounts with banks. The request was telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance for review. The Ministry of Finance responded with a telegram stating: The Ministry's recently issued Measures for the Administration of Banks stipulate that the use of commercial bank funds should primarily target lending to agricultural, industrial, and mining production, the transport and sale of essential daily necessities, and the transport and sale of foreign trade products. It has also been stipulated that banks should enter into contracts in advance for the aforementioned loans, whether in the form of loans or overdrafts. This demonstrates the Ministry's emphasis on assisting industrial and commercial production. The requirement to enter into contracts for overdrafts is intended to improve the soundness of banking operations and to facilitate auditing, and does not imply any restriction on the amount of overdrafts. Moreover, overdrafts are contractual by nature. The Ministry's order to enter into contracts is merely a change from oral contracts to written contracts, which should not pose any difficulty. As for the previous limit of 5 million yuan for each overdraft account, that was a restriction imposed during the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Since the amendment to the Temporary Measures for the Administration of Banks in Extraordinary Times in December of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], and the promulgation of the Measures for the Administration of Bank Mortgage and Credit Loans, this limit has been abolished. Furthermore, since the promulgation of the Ministry of Finance's Measures for the Administration of Banks in April of this year, the previously promulgated Measures for the Administration of Bank Mortgage and Credit Loans have also been repealed. There is no limit on the amount of overdrafts for industry and commerce from banks, nor is there any requirement for mandatory guarantees. The points mentioned in the telegram are largely misunderstandings. The Ministry previously received a petition from the Shanghai Banking Association in July of this year, stating that Shanghai banks have always entered into contracts for loans that are pledged or fixed-term. However, there have traditionally been no contracts for overdrafts. Now that they are required to enter into contracts for all overdrafts, the clients are not fully aware of the details and still need to be contacted and explained. The petition requested that the measure be implemented uniformly from September 1st of this year. The Ministry has verified that the claim is indeed true and has approved the request. However, they must strictly comply with the regulations in the future and must not disregard the instructions. The Shanghai Banking Association has been re-telegraphed to forward the instructions to all member banks to understand the original intent of the laws and handle the matter properly, without any misunderstanding or negligence. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce should inform the relevant guilds accordingly to handle the matter appropriately.

### Strong Demand for US Dollars, Gold Prices Also Boosted

Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market initially experienced fatigue and then declined, but the buying force from US dollars stimulated sentiment, leading to this outcome. The opening price was as low as 2.123 million, and initially the market was stable, struggling around 2.125 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 103 bars at a price of 2.12 million, after which the market became even more fatigued, falling as low as 2.115 million. At noon, the market remained sluggish, struggling around 2.12 million. In the afternoon, US dollars suddenly became tight, boosting the gold market. Next-day delivery opened even stronger, with the high price rising to 2.16 million before leveling off slightly. Dark interest rates remained between 12 and 15 cents.

The US dollar initially showed stability and then strengthened. In the morning, it hovered around 3360 yuan, and this price remained unchanged until noon. It was rumored that a major player was absorbing as much as possible, so in the afternoon, the buying sentiment suddenly ignited. In a state of scarcity, prices were raised sharply, and after breaking through the 3400 yuan mark, various speculative buying motives arose, and the competition to buy intensified, reaching 3480 yuan before a slight pullback. The closing price was 70 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also boosted, closing 10 yuan higher than before. The Hong Kong exchange rate was stable in the morning but strengthened in the afternoon, around 710 yuan. Indian exchange was above 850 yuan, British exchange was between 11,300 yuan and 11,500 yuan. The US exchange rate remained at the listed price, but few transactions occurred.

### Transfer of Speculative Funds, Foreign Stock Trading Gradually Activates

Foreign stocks, particularly British Consolidated, continued to advance, and Yu De also caught up slightly. Small stocks did not show any improvement. Xiangtai Timber also weakened, closing with a sell order at 12,000 yuan. Chinese stocks were unremarkable. Some speculative funds shifted to foreign stocks, causing a slight increase in activity. In the end, British Consolidated, Jardine Matheson, Wheelock Marden, Paper Industries, and China Merchants rose slightly. Steel, Jardine Brewery, and Kwong Ping Ping were flat. Xiangtai was quite weak.

### Sparse Bond Market Trading

Public debt trading decreased, with only over 2 million yuan in face value traded yesterday. The prices of each series fluctuated very little, either not advancing or retreating. Unified C opened at 2140 yuan in the morning, and then was surrounded by sellers, with the low price falling to 1960 yuan before stabilizing. It struggled around 2000 yuan at the close, ending 120 yuan lower than the previous close. Other series also fell by 90 yuan to 130 yuan.

### Wool Textile Industry Lacks Raw Materials

It is reported that Australian wool tops are not producing enough for their own needs recently and have restricted exports. Local wool textile factories are also unable to increase production due to the scarcity of wool arrivals. Therefore, the industry recently requested the Executive Yuan to find a way to procure raw materials on their behalf.

### Chongqing Yarn Industry Plans to Organize Exchange

[Chongqing, 18th] Both buyers and sellers in this city's cotton yarn market are individually responsible, which inevitably leads to various problems. The industry association plans to establish a cotton yarn exchange and has requested the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange for their organizational charter. They have also submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and filing. Before the exchange is established, group trading will be adopted to impose restrictions.

### Grain Transit Measures: Shanghai Continues to Apply, Extended to the End of October

The food transit measures formulated by the Ministry of Food in March expired at the end of August. According to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the main points of the grain transit measures in this city are as follows: (1) Grain merchants engaged in transit trade should purchase from the producing areas and not purchase from the market. (2) When purchasing in the producing areas, grain merchants should first report the purchasing location, quantity, and sales destination to the Ministry of Food for approval and issuance of a certificate. This certificate should be presented to the Customs for verification during transportation. (3) When imported foreign rice is declared for transit, the Customs will verify and release it.

### Cotton Textile Company Allocation Prices Remain Unchanged from Last Period; Rayon Begins to Fall Yesterday, Down 200,000 Yuan from the Previous Day

Yesterday, the opening price of rayon was still quite firm. The No. 120 Tianqiao light-colored product was priced at 3.4 million yuan. Later, because the Cotton Textile Company listed allocation to silk weaving factories with the same prices as last period, and some hoarders were selling off large quantities on the market at high prices, sentiment weakened and buying became thin. The lowest price fell to 145,000 yuan. In the morning, trading closed at 180,000 yuan. In the afternoon, actual sales absorbed some at lower prices, and the market rebounded to 225,000 yuan. In the end, it fell by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Miscellaneous brands also fell by about 200,000 yuan. Factory-owned firm and steady, hovering around the original prices. Silk fabrics were generally firm. Huajin crepe had some buying sentiment yesterday, raising 150 yuan.

### Recent Transaction Price of Raw Silk: US$7.25

It is reported that with abundant Japanese silk inventories in the United States, most manufacturers believe that silk prices still have a downward trend, resulting in weakened buying sentiment. The US government stipulated last week that the minimum price for Japanese D-grade silk cannot be lower than 6.25 US dollars. Therefore, Shanghai silk prices have been relatively stable in recent days. On the 18th, China Silk sold over 20 bales of raw silk to an American firm, priced at 7.25 to 7.50 US dollars, approximately one US dollar higher than the US minimum price.

### Rice Market Turns from Fatigue to Firm, Flour and Wheat Continue to Rise

Yesterday, due to the cloudy weather, sentiment in the rice market turned firm. Japonica rice rose by 1000-2000 yuan, and indica rice also increased by over 1000 yuan. However, white yuan rice remained stable. Total registration of inbound goods amounted to over 12,000 piculs. Flour sales were active. Factories announced that supply could not meet demand, and prices continued to rise by 100-200 yuan. Wheat bran remained stable. Both Min and Guang wheat had buying sentiment, and Shantou also inquired, pushing prices up by 300-500 yuan. White wheat trends were unremarkable due to inactivity in the north. Soybean arrivals were continuous, and high-quality Nanyang beans were slightly taken, market conditions were showing an upward trend, rising 500-600 yuan. However, secondary quality beans still lacked transactions. Broad beans had brisk retail sales on the street, continuing to rise by 1000 yuan. Arrivals from Zhongguan were also scarce, so they could not withstand sales, and prices rose by over 1000 yuan. Shelled peanuts continued to be processed in Nanyang. There were fewer shipments due to cloudy weather, going up 1000-2000 yuan. Mung beans were faint, Canadian peas came back a little 1000-2000 yuan, corn was extremely sluggish, down a little more 1000 yuan or so. The oil market declined by about 1000-2000 yuan due to the gradual increase in arrivals from Qingdao. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil also fell by 1000 yuan. Clear oil was also down by more than 1000 yuan.

### Dull Securities Trading, New Light and American Asia are More Popular

Due to news of industrial loans, sentiment was better in the group of stocks at first yesterday. Each stock opened higher, and then were closed by those cashing profits, prices fell again. Yongxing retreated to the previous closing price. As American Asia approached the previous closing price, off-floor short coverings came forward to cover. Gradually stabilized in the quiet, so the on-floor intention suddenly became stronger, and the two major hot stocks once surged in a counter movement, near noon, a little firm, but near closing, those with floating profits were eager to close out, and no one was behind, so stocks returned in a short time and approached the lowest price to end. In the stock group, in addition to China-America Enamelware, which traded 5,000 shares at 75 after closing, the rest generally revealed a sluggish momentum. Trading in the trading floor was light, and within half an hour after the morning opening, it was quiet. In addition to American Asia and New Light, which were crowded with people in front of the counter, even Yongxing, which has always considered itself the leading star, was lonely. As a result, the previous closures showed Yongxing, American Asia, Jingfu and Qinxing slightly risen, New Light declined slightly, cold stocks like Tongyi, New Asia, Cement and Innery all reduced by half a percent, China-America Silk, Datong, Company 5 and Wei He rose slightly, Jinglun and Rongfeng declined slightly, and the rest were flat. The total transaction volume of the city reached 7,256,500 shares, about 2 million shares more than yesterday, of which New Light increased the most (according to New Light, the transaction volume on the 17th was only 150,000 shares, 1.5 million shares on the 18th, and increased to 2,570,000 shares on the 19th). The veteran stocks operated off-floor still declined slightly.

### Sugar Arrives in Succession; Sugar Market Weakens Daily; Raw Sugar Falls Below Allotment Price

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Haiyu vessel carrying over 61,000 bags of Taiwanese sugar was noted in yesterday's report. It has come to our attention that the Haikang vessel arrived in port the night before last, also carrying 36,137 bags of sugar from Keelung, purchased and loaded by the Sugar Corporation. It is currently docked at floating docks 20 and 21 awaiting unloading. Furthermore, it is reported that the Haitian vessel is also carrying sugar. This vessel must first sail from Keelung to North China before turning back to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive around the end of the month.

Yesterday, the sugar market felt even weaker as the Taiwan Sugar Company's allotment price was confirmed to have been reduced by 10,000 yuan. The Shanghai Sugar Association's quoted price for No. 20 medium white sugar in stock initially was 137,000 to 138,000 yuan, but later dropped to 136,000 yuan, a decrease of over 10,000 yuan. Raw red sugar even fell below the new allotment price, reaching only 100,800 to 106,000 yuan, a drop of over 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Refined sugar was initially priced at 120,000 yuan, but later dropped to 119,000 yuan. The allotment price for the 14th period of medium white sugar was 130,000 yuan, and for raw red sugar, 110,000 yuan. The total number of applications was 16,150 bags, including 15,850 bags of medium white sugar and 300 bags of raw red sugar, accounting for 181 units. Except for sugar, confectionery, and tea food businesses applying for less than 20 bags, the rest were all sugar merchants.

### Cigarette Industry Petitions for Collection of Taxes at 60% of the Tax Amount

The local cigarette industry is suffering from the pressure of imported cigarettes and heavy taxes. At the same time, due to political instability, traffic obstructions, and declining sales, as well as the rising cost of labor and endless exploitation by high-interest loans, the entire industry has entered a major crisis. After an emergency meeting of the association's directors and supervisors, it was decided to send representatives Dai Gengxin, Pan Mingxin, Bao Gengsheng, Ke Renshi, Jing Shuping, and Yao Shushen to petition President Song and the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau today for relief. If this is unsuccessful, it is reported that next Monday, all directors and supervisors will represent the city's 80-plus cigarette factories in going to Beijing to petition the relevant ministries and departments of the central government, urging the government to pay attention. It is reported that the purpose of the association's petition is to request that, starting from October 1, taxes be collected at a reduced rate of 60% of the tax amount. At the same time, they are also requesting the improvement of the accounting and payment methods in order to alleviate the emergency and cultivate tax revenue.

### Yarn Sales Become More Active; Market Prices Rise by 30,000 to 50,000; Gray Fabric Prices Surge by 5,000 to 6,000

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market appeared even more robust. Transactions in medium and small-sized yarns were quite lively. Merchants from Jing, Han, Xiang, Gan, and other regions showed considerable interest, and morale was exceptionally high. Yarns produced by the Fangjian mill, such as Wei Ma, Lan Feng, Shui Yue, and Ri Guang brands, were particularly popular. This was because pure weaving factories were selecting raw materials, specifying these brands, with a sense of "no other will do." Overall, apart from the special-grade Ma yarn, which remained unchanged, the prices of the remaining yarns rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The price of 42-count yarn also rose by 50,000 yuan. Although the price increases were not drastic, the foundation was particularly stable. It is heard that the spot goods of various spinning mills are finding it difficult to meet demand. As a result, the prices of other brands of yarn also rose by varying amounts of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. High-grade cotton gray fabrics have seen a surge in price in recent days by about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per piece, because Fangjian has yet to release its leading products, and the peak season for colored cloth sales is approaching. Fangjian's market opening remains as originally planned, with dyeing and weaving factories being allocated fine cloth, while cloth shops' fine cloth ranges from No. 499 to No. 700, and gold lotus serge also ranges from No. 46 to No. 800, it is said.

### Measures for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to the South Have Been Drafted; Legitimate Manufacturers Can Still Engage in Reasonable Sales; Smuggling Routes and Quantities in Guangdong Province

[Report from Our Newspaper] Our reporter recently visited Mr. Liu Wenteng, the Director of the Business Department of the Textile Industry Administration Committee, to inquire about the current situation of yarn sales to South China. He said: Regarding the situation of yarn and cloth sales to the South, he had telegraphed the Fangjian representative stationed in Guangdong for a detailed investigation. According to the first reply telegram, neither the Guangdong Customs nor the Goods Tax Bureau had such statistics. Now, after a second investigation, the results are quite detailed and can be described in four points: (1) All yarn and cloth in Guangzhou city are transported from Shanghai. Each month, approximately 18,000 to 20,000 bales of cotton yarn and approximately 10,000 bales of cloth are shipped. Among imported cotton yarns, 10-count, 20-count, and 30-count yarns are the most common. 32-count and 42-count fine yarns account for only a small portion. Among cotton fabrics, fine cloth and dyed cloth account for the largest proportion. Twill cloth, blue cloth, and various colored patterns are next in terms of volume. Chong serge is even less common. (2) In terms of yarn sales, due to the tax exemption for local cloth exports, the local cloth manufacturing industry in Guangzhou and Foshan is very developed. Regarding yarn sales in various locations, Guangzhou can sell approximately 1,500 bales per month. Foshan can sell approximately 2,000 bales per month. The sales volume in the various counties of the Four Districts (Siyi) is very small, only 50 to 60 bales per month, but Wuzhou sells approximately 2,000 to 3,000 bales per month. Among the counties in the Dongjiang area, Huizhou and Xingning have relatively high sales volumes, reaching approximately 1,000 bales. As for cloth sales, in terms of the quantity sold by Fangjian's branch in Guangzhou, Guangzhou accounts for 30%, Wuzhou accounts for 15%, Siyi accounts for 5%, the Dongjiang area accounts for 10%, and Hong Kong accounts for 40%. (3) Guangzhou yarn and cloth have always been prohibited from being transported to Hong Kong and Macau. However, speculators often declare to customs that they are transporting goods to Zhongshan, Xiaohang, and Sanbu, and then transship them to Macau. They declare that they are transporting goods to Dongguan and Changping, and then transship them to Hong Kong. They declare that they are transporting goods to Haikou and Zhanjiang, and then transship them to Annam (Vietnam). There are no formal channels for transporting goods to Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Macau through customs. (4) Recently, the export of locally made yarn and cloth from Hong Kong has also been prohibited. However, those who have applied for import can export according to the declaration. Therefore, the smuggling routes of smugglers, in addition to the third route, also include the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway, passing through Shenzhen and cooperating with special forces to directly transport goods to Hong Kong. However, the yarn and cloth that does not pass through Macau can only be sold in Hong Kong. It is heard that the Hong Kong authorities may, at their discretion, allow exports when the stock in Hong Kong is abundant. It is estimated that the monthly smuggling volume is half of the yarn and cloth imported into Guangzhou.

It was also reported that the Textile Industry Administration Committee, having been instructed by the Executive Yuan on the 9th to draft temporary management measures for the transportation of cotton yarn and cloth to South China, has already jointly drafted the measures with Director Zhang Fuyun of the Customs Administration. These measures were submitted to Beijing last Saturday for review and are currently awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. He stated that the drafting of these measures focuses on being based on evidence and being effective, striving to ensure fair implementation and scientific management, so that legitimate manufacturers can still engage in reasonable sales of yarn and cloth to the South China region.

### Capital of Companies During the Occupation; Ministry of Economic Affairs Instructs on Valuation Methods; Unregistered Companies Will Be Dissolved After the Deadline

The registration of recovered areas has been extended by the Ministry of Economic Affairs until the end of this year and will not be extended further. All companies must complete the registration procedures within the specified period. Any company that fails to do so will be dissolved and liquidated. This so-called dissolution means that the company is deemed to no longer exist, and its rights, obligations, and sovereignty are extinguished. As for the capital adjustment and valuation calculation methods for companies during the occupation period, the Ministry has provided examples for clarification as follows: For example, a company originally had a legal tender capital of 1 million yuan, with each share worth 10,000 yuan. Later, it increased its capital by 9 million in puppet currency, totaling 900 shares. The two types of shares total 1,000 shares. The 9 million in puppet currency is converted into 45,000 yuan in legal tender according to the current fixed ratio. Together with the original legal tender capital, the total is 1,045,000 yuan. The newly added assets after the capital increase, valued in legal tender, are assumed to be 8 million in puppet currency. Calculated per share based on 1,000 shares, each share is worth 8,000 yuan. The 800,000 yuan obtained by the old shares is used as a reserve fund. The new shares total 7.2 million yuan. If converted according to the prescribed ratio, it is 42,000 yuan, which is still 1,755,000 yuan less than the original increased puppet currency amount. This difference can be resolved by the shareholders' meeting to make up for the shortfall, but the old shareholders must first subscribe with cash. If any of the old shareholders have never participated in the subscription of new shares in puppet currency, they should have priority in subscribing. If they give up their right, the new shareholders can subscribe to make up the full amount. If it cannot be determined, the shareholders' meeting should resolve to reduce the capital. As for the valuation result, including the 45,000 yuan converted according to the prescribed ratio, it must not exceed the original capital amount of 9 million yuan.

### After the Decline of Dutch East Indies and Japanese Tea, the Hope for Chinese Tea is Great; The Problem Lies in Whether Transportation Can Be Improved; Losses Will Be Significant if Handled by Non-Experts; British Expert Advises Tea Merchants Not to Repeat the Mistakes of Adulteration

[Reuters, London, 18th] Mr. Weiden, former tea industry advisor to the Chinese government, published a paper stating that the Dutch East Indies, the world's third-largest tea producer, has completely halted exports due to political turmoil. According to reports, most of its tea plants were damaged during the Japanese occupation. Japan is now operating the tea industry, and Taiwan has also been returned to China. In 1941, the Dutch East Indies exported 167,048,000 pounds of tea. In 1937, Japan exported 54,194,000 pounds of tea, while Taiwan exported 23,117,000 pounds of tea. The world market will suffer a loss of approximately 240 to 250 million pounds per year due to the loss of these three production areas. In 1938, China's tea exports were: 24,009,000 pounds of black tea, 50,959,000 pounds of green tea, 4,135,000 pounds of brick tea, and 12,664,000 pounds of other types, totaling 91,767,000 pounds. With Japan and the Dutch East Indies excluded from the market, China has a good opportunity to make up for the world's losses with its production. Furthermore, after India and Ceylon fully restore black tea production, China will not face any strong competitors if it exports green tea to the United States and North Africa. The Taiwanese tea that can now be exported from China is of excellent quality and is said to enjoy a particularly high price in the United States. The problem facing the resumption of Chinese tea exports is whether the existing tea can be exported. Most of China's tea-producing areas are outside the Japanese-controlled areas, and all tea trees have not suffered from unharvested diseases. The current difficulty lies in whether the tea can be transported to major ports. Although transportation may be difficult, there must be a large number of ships traveling between the ports of Shanghai to facilitate the return voyage with tea. As for financial issues, China can contact various countries to raise funds. Although exchange rate stabilization is still lacking, which is inevitably a major obstacle, barter trade may be adopted. The question awaiting the Chinese government's response is whether the Chinese government can still directly negotiate export methods with various foreign firms as before the war, or whether it can establish its own institutions. In the author's observation, if this highly specialized matter is entrusted to personnel with no experience, the financial losses will be significant. Furthermore, this year's exports have not been satisfactory, with poor quality and high prices. 75% of the goods sold are often deteriorated. Taking high-quality Keemun tea as an example, the price in London is 8 shillings and 6 pence (including insurance and shipping costs), but the samples are vastly different compared to the goods of 1944 and 1945. It is heard that inland merchants often mix old tea with new tea. If inferior tea is priced too high, the reputation enjoyed by the Chinese tea trade will be lost, and purchasing merchants will seek other sources.

### Guaranteeing Merchants' Tax Payments; Direct Tax Bureau Declares that Trade Associations Have No Such Obligation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the local Wine and Cuisine Trade Association, stating that it is legally unfounded and fraught with obstacles for the association to guarantee merchants' tax payments, and requested that it be abolished. The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Direct Tax Bureau, requesting that the measure be abolished. The Bureau has now replied: "The application form and guarantee letter for resident merchants were formulated and issued by the Direct Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance. It has been implemented in various inland provinces for a long time. All recovered areas have also implemented it long ago. It was not a free creation of this Bureau. Since the establishment of this Bureau, it has been observed that most merchants in Shanghai generally abide by the law. In addition, the organization of trade associations is sound. Therefore, there has been no need to handle the resident merchant guarantee for the time being. As for the Shanghai Wine and Cuisine Trade Association's statement that this Bureau is implementing this guarantee measure, or that the Bureau's district offices have occasionally adopted this measure to control tax revenue due to the closure of a small number of merchants, the Bureau has not issued such an order to force trade associations to provide guarantees." The Chamber of Commerce will inform the Wine and Cuisine Trade Association of the situation for its information.

### The Art of Health and Longevity; Why Do We Humans Die in Vain?

— Original by Lawrence Lader, Published in the June 1946 Issue of Crown Magazine

We regularly inspect the cars we use to prevent damage, but why do we only pay attention to our own bodies and seek medical treatment after we become ill? Isn't that too late!

Someone never fell ill and usually exercised, but suddenly collapsed in the office and passed away a week later, not even reaching the age of fifty. Such a death is truly not worth it! This is because all chronic diseases develop silently, and patients are often unaware. However, according to medical statistics, if physical examinations are performed annually, early detection and timely treatment can prevent death. Most deaths are an unnecessary sacrifice. We may think we are very healthy, walking with great speed, with no signs of illness, but we do not know that most deadly diseases have no warning signs beforehand, and once they are discovered, it is too late! Dr. John of the New York Life Extension Institute reported that among a thousand businessmen who thought they were healthy and were buying cars or real estate, only one hundred and fourteen were truly healthy. Among them, sixteen cases had already suffered from quite serious illnesses. Because most people do not pay attention to real killer diseases, they unknowingly kill many people. For the sake of health, to avoid death that is not worth it, why not have a physical examination once a year? There is no loss of time and energy, but the benefits are endless. The value of the examination lies in preventing disease and detecting hidden problems. Many deadly diseases are very easy to cure if detected early. There are many examples. As for the cost of the examination, it is not too much. Why not spend a small amount of money to gain health and longevity! In this era of scientific advancement, wouldn't it be a great injustice to die in vain!

### Why Do We Abandon the Inestimable Harvest?; An Analysis of Health Examinations

To conduct large-scale health examinations, in terms of manpower, we need three specialized physicians, four assistant nurses, two administrative staff, one clerk, three tea attendants, and two chemists. In terms of material resources, we need an X-ray machine, some testing equipment, a complete pathological chemistry laboratory, and five rooms. In terms of publicity, because the public lacks medical knowledge, to make people turn back from the sea of suffering from illness as soon as possible, so that diagnosis can achieve the goal of health, it is necessary to loudly advocate for it. In summary, the three items of expenditure are estimated at 4.02 million yuan for salaries, 1 million yuan for food, 4 million yuan for depreciation and interest on the X-ray machine, and other similar expenses, and 1.6 million yuan for publicity, totaling 14.62 million yuan. In one month, 342 readers of this newspaper received preferential examinations, with a total income of 2.33 million yuan. So, wouldn't this be a waste of money? No! We concentrate the contributions of science and sacrifice manpower and material resources, and there are inestimable harvests. We would like to present this to you and try to prove it with facts.

The Shin Pao History Museum called the hospital the other day to say that a gentleman from the Central Bank, who is currently staying in an ordinary ward, has been there for three months. They asked if he could receive free preferential treatment. After an investigation by the hospital's service department, it was learned that the gentleman had tuberculosis in both lungs. After considerable treatment, he has recovered. However, he now has an anal complication, and it is difficult to predict when he will recover. It is even more difficult to answer how the economy will be budgeted. If the gentleman had a health examination a year ago, he would not only have avoided infection in the intestines, but his health would have recovered in a way that was not out of sight, and the economy would not be in a difficult situation. Moreover, if one lung could be treated early, the other lung might not be affected. The cost of the examination at that time would have been no more than a few rickshaw fares, and he could have obtained inestimable health and happiness. But he missed the golden period for early treatment. Isn't it too late to seek relief now! According to the professional class, it is unfortunate to suffer from this chronic disease, which deprives individuals of their health and causes family and social tragedies. This kind of fact has been seen countless times in the ten years since the establishment of this hospital. Their sad and tragic experiences cannot be fully described in writing. For example, Miss Yingzi, an artist, didn't she play the role of Meibao in the play "Autumn Begonia" and win the audience's admiration, giving them a very deep impression? However, due to excessive hard work, latent tuberculosis was found. When X-ray examination revealed five cavities the size of silver dollars, scattered between the two lung lobes, she was hospitalized for treatment. Judging from the latent period, it must have been more than a year. It is a pity that the report was too late, and she has been hospitalized for three years. What can be estimated for the loss to her personally and to the artistic community? If she had obtained an X-ray diagnosis a year ago due to some opportunity, and thus received early treatment, what would have been her contribution to the artistic community in the past three years? If a reader unintentionally has a health examination, and that person discovers a latent lesion, and therefore receives early treatment, and recovers in a few months, not only will he regain his health and engage in production early, but he will also avoid infecting others. If, in a few decades, he becomes a great entrepreneur or a great inventor, benefiting society and the people, then what can be estimated for the harvest of his unintentional health examination in the past? Our service at this time, so-called health examination, is a sacred work, and it does not seem to be an exaggeration.

Unfortunately, this inestimable harvest is still largely unknown to the general public (as can be seen from the small number of readers who received preferential examinations last month), and even some doctors have doubts. In fact, the more common health knowledge is, the more people will seek medical treatment. If everyone can go to various hospitals for various examinations before seeking medical treatment, and obtain an accurate pathological report, then the doctor can see everything at a glance and see the key to the problem, saving many procedures. Because the patient has obtained an accurate pathological report in advance, they will not delay the time and achieve the goal of quick treatment and quick recovery. Both parties can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, those who are proved to be healthy by the examination do not need to seek medical treatment again, so how much time and money is saved? Isn't the British people's health certificate justified? Our country's society has always paid little attention to public health. Although experts such as Li Tingan, Zhang Wei, and Liu Ruiheng have repeatedly said so (see below), the listeners are few, which is really heartbreaking! Today, people in all countries of the world know how to strive for their personal right to health as the foundation for survival and happiness. Why does our country's people alone ignore the health they should enjoy? It is really difficult to understand after thinking about it a hundred times. It must be known that the invisible killing of diseases is ten times or a hundred times greater than tangible war, and war has an end, but the war between mankind and disease has no end. In this era of scientific advancement, why do we not seek the protection of health and willingly die in vain?

If everyone can have a health examination, the earlier and more diseases will be discovered, the more doctors will be needed, and the fewer people will die in vain. The more common the examination work is, the broader the business of doctors will be, and the more health the people will improve. Examination and doctors are like fish and water, the two are inseparable. Without examination, doctors cannot make correct diagnoses and treatments. If patients do not have examinations, they have no way to examine latent diseases, and there is a danger of getting out of hand at any time. In short, the benefits of examination are really inestimable, but those who can reap this benefit belong to those who have an examination early. As for our work, it is only cultivation!

### During the Eight Years of the War of Resistance, 3.1 Million Soldiers and Civilians Died; The Number of People Who Died from Tuberculosis Reached 4.5 Million Last Year

World War II gave mankind great terror and danger, but in fact, the danger of tuberculosis is no less than that. During the eight years of China's War of Resistance, the total number of soldiers and civilians who died, as announced, was only 3.1 million, but the estimated number of people who died from tuberculosis last year alone was approximately 4.5 million. Tangible enemies are certainly fierce, but the tuberculosis bacteria that cannot be seen with the naked eye are even more terrible and dangerous. Taking Shanghai as an example, the rampantness of tuberculosis is shocking. In the first six months of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the number of residents who died from tuberculosis in the British and French Concessions at that time was 2,269, while the total number of deaths from seven statutory infectious diseases was only 1,02. That is, the mortality rate of tuberculosis alone exceeded the total number of deaths from seven infectious diseases by 141.6%. Now, although the invaders have been driven out of the country, more ferocious enemies are still mixed in our families, institutions, organizations, factories, schools, and the entire society and country, allowing them to spread and grow, slaughtering 4.5 million innocent people every year, and making ten times more of them disabled and bedridden. So rampant, how significant is its relationship to national health. Moreover, the age of those who suffer from this disease is mostly between 20 and 45 years old. The prime of their useful years is spent on the sickbed, year after year, until their lives are cut short. How can the loss of manpower and material resources be calculated? Shanghai is like this, then other provinces and cities can be imagined. We are responsible for the health of the people, how can we turn a blind eye? It is hoped that the general pioneers and enlightened people and those who are enthusiastic about society will work together to kill this beast, so that the nation can be placed in the realm of health, and the shame of the sick man of East Asia can be washed away.

### Modern Perspectives on Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment (Part 2)

— Wu Shaoqing

Early Diagnosis and Treatment and Public Health Facilities

The possibility of curing tuberculosis varies with the severity of the disease: early stages are mild, late stages are severe; mild cases are easy to treat, severe cases are difficult to save. What we usually see is that those who come for treatment are mostly in the late stages. This is because when the disease is mild, there are no serious symptoms, or even no symptoms at all to attract the patient's attention; once the symptoms are obvious and they go to see a doctor, the easy-to-treat period has often been missed. Even if some remedy can be made, only one in four on average can be cured. Therefore, among the patients living in tuberculosis sanatoriums, those with advanced tuberculosis account for about 85% to 90%, the efficiency of treatment is very low, and the cost of money is even greater. The results over the years are limited. From the perspective of the entire anti-tuberculosis campaign, this is unwise and uneconomical. The way to improve this is to diagnose and treat early. The efficiency of treatment is higher, and the money and time spent by patients can be saved; the advantages and disadvantages are as different as heaven and earth. To implement early diagnosis and treatment, it is necessary to select groups with a higher tuberculosis rate, those who are in contact with tuberculosis patients, and people with higher susceptibility, and give them X-ray lung examinations before their symptoms are discovered. The most economical and reliable method is to use a small mobile X-ray machine, which costs only four cents per film in US dollars. Early patients who are found should be treated as soon as possible, paying a limited price and receiving great benefits.

Some people say that there are already so many people suffering from tuberculosis now that accommodating and treating them is already in short supply, and it is difficult to meet the current needs. Why bother to find early patients and make the problem even more difficult? This is a question that ordinary people should have. Little do they know that if these early patients are not found and treated as soon as possible, they will fill up the tuberculosis hospitals in the future and be impossible to cure, and those who occupy the beds for a long time must be these patients. This is a vicious circle that will never end. It is like us only saving a prairie fire without knowing how to bend the chimney and remove the firewood. However, since there are so many late-stage patients and so little hope of cure, if they are not admitted to the hospital, there is a risk of infecting others; if they are admitted to the hospital, they will stay for an indefinite period of time. What should be done? In countries with sound health systems, these patients should also be admitted to hospitals. Although the possibility of treatment is small, it can still serve the purpose of isolation. Our country is poor and financially exhausted, and human and material resources are extremely difficult. The minimum conditions for tuberculosis prevention have not yet been met. How can we live in these extremely limited hospitals for endless isolation? Moreover, the number of tuberculosis patients in the country is no less than millions, and trying to implement hospital isolation is like using a cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood, which is both impossible and unwise. The alternative is to use the services of public health nurses to implement isolation at home according to the law, so that patients' living habits are all in accordance with hospital regulations. What is especially important is to prevent infection to others. In addition, the establishment of clinics will allow patients to have doctors to diagnose and treat them and guide them on how to recuperate at any time. In this way, a lot of expenses can be saved, and both isolation and recuperation can be taken care of. This method may not be perfect, but it is an inevitable stage in our country's initial tuberculosis prevention. In the future, when hospitals become more popular and more beds are available, these late-stage patients must be admitted to the hospital to achieve the effect of isolation.

Clinics and Sanatoriums

These two items can be mentioned together because they are closely related and their main purpose is treatment. When it comes to treatment, the first thing that people usually want to ask is whether there is a specific drug that can cure tuberculosis. In recent years, the United States has paid special attention to this research. Although some drugs have caused a sensation for a while, there is still a lack of drugs that have special effects on the human body. Our treatment must still rely on past experience and recent knowledge, and we still regard bed rest, increased nutrition, and fresh air as golden rules. Although these are old tunes, they should not be taken lightly even today. As for lung compression therapy, the methods vary, and the way to choose depends on the patient's condition. The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, which lies in the doctor's ability to choose and use them well. Ordinary patients, due to lack of common sense about tuberculosis, often ask for injections, thinking that new methods of treating tuberculosis must involve injections. As a result, advertising drugs take the opportunity to show off, disregarding morality and engaging in false propaganda; and patients do not notice and are easily misled, gaining nothing but spiritual comfort, and there is absolutely no benefit to the crux of the disease. Their eagerness to seek treatment is understandable, but their foolishness is also pitiful. The loss of money is a small matter, but missing the treatment period is a great misfortune.

Tuberculosis is different from other diseases. Its recovery comes gradually, so there are strict regulations on its depth and extent. It cannot be said that the disease is cured just because the symptoms disappear. Therefore, a patient's desire to return to work cannot be determined by his own general feeling. Some patients, because their inherent occupation hinders their health, if they continue this kind of work, the disease may recur. Therefore, they must find ways to adjust it, or help them choose another occupation, so as to restore their production and economic capacity, and at the same time reduce the possibility of tuberculosis recurrence. All larger sanatoriums should have this vocational guidance agency. The United Kingdom has tuberculosis villages, where various crafts are organized, and patients who are gradually recovering participate in work under the guidance of doctors. There are also a few places in the United States where this is done sporadically. Now this kind of work is gradually developing on a large scale. Our country's industry is backward and its economic situation is extremely unstable. It may not be easy to establish such a large-scale institution under these circumstances. However, it can also be determined based on the local situation in each area, and private individuals or groups can be encouraged to establish it. In the future, it will be gradually promoted, and the assistance of both labor and management will be obtained to achieve a sound institution to complete the final link in the tuberculosis prevention and treatment process. In 1943, the United Kingdom, based on a proposal by Tang Linsheng, stipulated by law that unemployed people with tuberculosis, in addition to government subsidies for family living and child support, also receive government assistance for their own occupational rehabilitation. Several states in the United States also have similar relief measures. The purpose is to allow patients who seek medical treatment to be able to recuperate in the hospital with peace of mind, without the burden of family finances and the worry of their own unemployment. Only in this way can the patient's post-recovery work be considered thorough, and the highest level of tuberculosis prevention and treatment can be said to be achieved.

The above overview of the work is only a statement of the principles. As for the implementation plan, it depends on the degree of human, financial, and material resources. In today's China, there is an extreme lack of all three of these, and it is impossible to carry out a widespread program. However, the situations in various places are different, so it is better to select and run areas where these three conditions can reach a considerable level. On the one hand, promote the work, and on the other hand, train talents in order to gradually expand it. This kind of work is broad in nature and large in scale. It cannot be done by a small number of tuberculosis doctors, nor can it be undertaken alone by government health administrative agencies. Even if there is an anti-tuberculosis association in the local area, although the purpose is the same, it can only achieve one aspect of anti-tuberculosis. It is necessary to gather the strength of the people of the whole country. Regardless of whether the agency is official or private, all those whose purpose is to prevent tuberculosis must do their best and cooperate fully. What is even more important is the support of people who are enthusiastic about social causes. The American Tuberculosis Association, a public organization, raised as much as 17 million US dollars last year, and its source is entirely from free donations from the public, and the government has not allocated a penny. The sense of responsibility of its citizens can be seen from this. We should recognize tuberculosis as our common enemy. Regardless of whether it is north or south, whether it is men or women, whether it is old or young, we must be of one heart and one mind and go all out to fight it. The spirit of resisting Japan is like this, and the spirit of resisting tuberculosis should be even more so.

### The Spiritual Factors in Tuberculosis Treatment

— Xia Zhenyi

The key to treating tuberculosis is the well-known "rest." But I know that many people do not have a deep understanding of rest. They often rest their bodies in bed, but their minds are still constantly planning their careers, trusting their lovers, worrying about their illnesses, and worrying about the burden of medical expenses. In short, there are all kinds of thoughts, rising and falling one after another, so that their nerves do not have a moment of peace. This is actually a common problem among tuberculosis patients, and it is also a serious obstacle to treatment. We know that the whole person includes both physical and mental aspects. Only physical rest, without mental or spiritual rest, is not complete rest, not real rest.

In addition to "rest first" in tuberculosis treatment, "nutrition" is also a necessary condition for treatment. The great physiologist Canuon once proved the close relationship between the mind and the body. Emotions such as fear, anxiety, and sorrow can stimulate the excessive secretion of adrenaline, resulting in physiological phenomena such as heartbeat, sweating, pupil dilation, increased blood sugar, and cessation of gastrointestinal peristalsis and secretion. Because of the cessation of gastrointestinal peristalsis and secretion, the result is reduced appetite, digestive disorders, and a serious threat to the nutrition of the whole body. This also creates an obstacle to the treatment of tuberculosis.

I often see many patients who panic when they experience hemoptysis, as if they have been sentenced to death. They cry all day long and cannot think about eating. In fact, hemoptysis is a warning bell for tuberculosis, and it is not necessarily a sign that the disease is incurable. You must seek medical attention and examination as soon as possible, which is the best way. If you only have unnecessary fear and worry, it is tantamount to destroying the fortress of your spirit yourself, giving germs the opportunity to expand and invade, thus invisibly forfeiting the good opportunity for you to be cured. I do not know how many mild tuberculosis patients, when the doctor tells them that there is a disease in the lungs, become afraid and anxious. Because of this mental factor, the initial tuberculosis patients who are easy to cure quickly turn into a serious and incurable state. How foolish is this!

From the perspective of psychiatry, I often encounter many anxiety states, nervousness or neurasthenia, and other kinds of neurosis, as well as severe mental depression occurring in tuberculosis patients. The reason for this is that the tuberculosis causes unnecessary fear, anxiety, and frustration, which makes the nerves tense for a long time. Health is what everyone seeks. If you already have a disease in your body, worry is futile. On the contrary, it leads to serious mental illness, which further creates an obstacle to treatment.

Anxiety and fear open the door for tuberculosis germs. Smart patients, you must be careful. The mind and body are inseparable. We must have an optimistic life, a happy mood, and a calm attitude to overcome your enemy—the tuberculosis demon.

### The Battle Between Humans and Germs (3)

— By Qiao Shumin

Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management"

(3) Susceptibility and Resistance

We are in the natural world, and the opportunities to come into contact with germs every day are countless. Fortunately, we have the ability to fight back, which is enough to defend us and prevent us from being completely susceptible to infection. This kind of resistance is very important to infectious disease managers. Now I will briefly describe the three aspects of general resistance, special resistance, and secondary factors related to resistance:

(1) General Resistance

A. Complete Skin—Most germs cannot reproduce on complete skin, nor can they break through the skin and enter the body. According to research by Arnold et al., normal skin is acidic (PH5.8-5.2), which is enough to eliminate ordinary germs. Therefore, the skin actually has some self-cleaning effect, probably related to the chemical properties of sweat.

B. Complete Mucous Membrane—The mucous membrane is often the gateway for germs to invade the human body, but it is not without resistance.

(1) Oral Cavity and Gastrointestinal Tract—The mucous membrane of the oral cavity has mucous fluid. The colloidal mucin contained in it and the saliva secreted by the oral cavity have the function of protecting and purifying foreign objects. If germs are swallowed into the esophagus and into the stomach, the gastric juice always has a very strong bactericidal effect, but it cannot exert its power on tuberculosis bacteria or amoebae that are protected by wax. However, when the body temperature is too high, gastric acid often decreases. Therefore, after diseases such as malaria or measles, dysentery or other gastrointestinal diseases often occur, probably due to this reason. The normal small intestine also does not contain bacteria, but when the body temperature is too high or there is a lack of vitamin A, the physiological function of the mucous membrane of the small intestine often loses its normal balance and is easily susceptible to infection.

(2) Nasopharynx, Throat, and Trachea—Due to the unique structure of the nose, most of the inhaled bacteria stop near the nostrils, and most of the bacteria that enter also adhere to the mucous membrane and reach the oral cavity due to the cleansing effect of mucus and villi. Therefore, the air in the trachea is mostly sterile under normal conditions.

(3) Conjunctiva—Tears clearly have the function of cleaning up invading germs. Also, tears are very rich in lysozyme, which is enough to destroy general germs.

(4) Mucous Membrane of the Genital Tract—The ordinary urethra does not contain germs because of the flushing effect of urine and the bactericidal effect of the acidic reaction of urine. The secretion of the cavity also has a very strong bactericidal power, but it is powerless to resist germs of venereal diseases and puerperal fever.

C. Phagocytosis

The phagocytosis of the human body was discovered three years ago. This function is extremely important for our resistance to general infectious diseases. Often after germs invade the human body, they encounter leukocytes in the body. Germs (or other foreign substances) actually have a force that attracts leukocytes, the so-called opsonin. This opsonin causes a physical change in a certain germ, thus causing the germ to be attacked.

D. Function of the Reticuloendothelial System

Reticuloendothelial system cells, such as splenic cells, liver Kupffer cells, lymph glands, bone marrow, adrenal glands, and vascular endothelial cells, all belong to this category. The free-moving histiocytes of this type of cell can compensate for the insufficient phagocytic power of general leukocytes, and can kill the remaining germs and wounded leukocytes, forming general granulation tissue, as seen in diseases such as tuberculosis, syphilis, and measles. Also, this type of cell has a great function in clearing germs in the blood. It can also eliminate the toxins of germs and produce antibodies. Approximately several bactericidal drugs, such as quinine, rely heavily on the function of these reticuloendothelial system cells in their pharmacological action.

E. Physiological Excretion—The excretion of germs and their toxins by patients through feces, urine, or bile is also one of the common phenomena of resistance to germs.

### The Principles of Tuberculosis Treatment

— Sun Zhongliang

To heal and restore any part of the body from injury, the most important condition is "rest." The most obvious example is an injury to the hand or foot. We all know not to let it move in order to recover as soon as possible. This basic principle of "rest" also applies to the treatment of tuberculosis, and it is the most important condition before a specific treatment for tuberculosis has been invented.

The lung is a respiratory organ that expands and contracts day and night. When it is diseased and damaged, we cannot use our will to control it to keep it still to achieve complete rest. Therefore, we have to seek the next best thing, which is to reduce its movement and get partial rest. The degree of lung movement is determined by the physical and mental activity of the whole body (the degree of metabolism). The mission of respiration is to supply the oxygen needed for the activity of the whole body and to eliminate its by-product, carbon dioxide. It is obvious that when the activity of the whole body increases, the need for oxygen is greater, and the production of carbon dioxide is also greater. Therefore, the movement of the lungs also increases. Rest can reduce the number, depth, and force of lung breathing. Rest for tuberculosis patients refers to the rest of the whole body. Lying in bed, the brain must also abstain from thinking in order to get good rest, because thinking also requires energy to increase metabolism. As for the so-called walking in the morning or doing deep breathing exercises, especially the latter, which increases lung movement, it runs counter to the principle of rest and should never be tried.

In addition to the above-mentioned negative effect on the treatment of tuberculosis, rest also has its positive significance. After the activity of the whole body is reduced, the circulation of blood and lymph in the whole body and the lungs is also reduced. Therefore, the toxins absorbed from the lesion area are also reduced. Therefore, systemic poisoning symptoms such as fever, night sweats, cough, and sputum can also be reduced by rest. Generally speaking, lying in bed will reduce appetite or even hinder digestion is really unfounded. Furthermore, the decrease and stagnation of blood and lymph circulation around the lung lesions may promote the proliferation of fibrous tissue, which is the element of healing of tuberculous lesions. Reducing breathing and weakening blood circulation can reduce the oxygen supply to the lesion area. Tuberculosis bacilli rely on oxygen to survive. Under such circumstances, their activity is also reduced, and the reproduction rate is greatly reduced. These are all the benefits of rest for the recovery of tuberculosis.

Getting up and moving around must be based on the doctor's prescription. It occupies the intermediate stage between bed rest and starting work. It must be done after recuperation to a suitable period before it can be implemented according to the doctor's instructions. The duration and nature of the exercise must be determined based on the condition of the lesion and the patient's general condition.

Although compression therapy is not a specific treatment for tuberculosis, it is indeed a great help in treating this disease at present. Artificial pneumothorax is to inject gas into the chest cavity to reduce the lung volume, relax the lesion area and get rest. The stagnation of blood and lymph around it further helps the proliferation of fibrous tissue to surround the lesion, and at the same time reduces the absorption of tuberculosis toxins to reduce systemic poisoning symptoms; lung cavities heal due to the torsion or blockage of the bronchi that connect them, and eventually disappear. However, artificial pneumothorax must not have adhesions between the lungs and pleura to obtain good results. A small amount of adhesion may be cut off by electrocautery (Pneumolysis) so that part of the diseased lung can get good compression. Surgery on the phrenic nerve (Phrenci Operation) to paralyze the movement of the diaphragm and make the lower part of the lung get compression is also a method to promote the rest of the diseased lung. Thoracoplasty is a further step to remove the ribs of the diseased lung area, the chest wall collapses, reducing the lung volume, and is also aimed at making the diseased lung area get rest. These various compression therapies are mostly performed in cases where the lesions have ulcerated or become cavities. Their selection depends on the lesions, the patient's general condition, and the economic situation, and there is no fixed way to follow. At the same time, because they are not specific treatments for lung disease, in other words, it does not mean that after the operation, the disease will be cured like a gastrointestinal inflammation after surgery, we still cannot forget the basic principle of general rest. The whole body rest must be earnestly implemented according to the doctor's instructions in order to make the diseased lung recover as soon as possible.

In addition, in recent years, surgical treatment has tended to remove diseased lungs or lobes (Pneumonectomy or Lobectomy). This is a major operation and can only be applied after careful consideration by experts.

Nutrition is the second element in the treatment of tuberculosis. What we want is a general balanced diet, including adequate amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and other elements. Patients certainly need more nutrition than ordinary people, but they do not need to eat delicacies every meal, chicken, duck, fish, and meat. We require a slightly richer balanced diet than usual. Adding rest can make the weight gradually increase, from the level below the weight to slightly higher than the general standard, but we do not hope to exceed the standard weight too much. Weight gain is certainly a good phenomenon, but it does not necessarily mean that the lesions are healing. This is a point that should be paid attention to during the treatment period, so as not to neglect rest because of it.

Cool air (not cold air) can stimulate vitality and make patients feel happy, which is the third element in the treatment of tuberculosis. As for recuperation in another place, it must be decided after considering other more important conditions and the local treatment facilities and the patient's economic situation.

Finally, regarding drug treatment, a specific drug has not yet been successfully tested as of now. The pathological condition of tuberculosis is special, making it difficult for drugs to be effective, and generally, tuberculosis with very deep tissue damage may not be cured by drugs. Compression therapy will probably still maintain its position in such cases.

Spring and Autumn

### The Slave's Blood (Novel)

— Wang Ji

A pool of blood on the floorboards.

A pool of slave's blood.

The fresh blood that flowed from Ah Hua's veins the night before the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Ah Hua was a fourteen-year-old girl, bartered for three dou of rice by my mother at the end of last year. I don't know where she's from, but her accent suggests she's not far from here. She has no surname; according to her, everyone has called her Ah Hua since she was little, exactly the same name as the flower dog we keep at home. Oddly enough, "Ah Hua the person" had not been here for long, before "Ah Hua the dog" passed away. "Ah Hua the person" replaced "Ah Hua the dog."

To the point where a person is less than a dog.

Ah Hua isn't unintelligent, nor is she insensible, but like all children, she can't avoid being mischievous. Washing rice, carrying water, cooking, emptying chamber pots, she manages it all, but every task is always accompanied by some wildness: when washing rice, she'll try to catch fish, and if she catches one, she'll shout "Young master, young master" and rush in, only to receive a scolding from my mother, quickly dampening my enthusiasm. When tending the fire, she'll use charcoal sticks to doodle on the stove wall: human heads, the character for "heaven," things that look neither like dogs nor pigs. It suddenly reminds me of the psychology I studied at university, but my mother always gives her a stern scolding.

My mother is an old-fashioned woman from a humble background, in her late fifties. She always objects to us people in our twenties still studying, and objects to Ling Ling, my newly married wife, going to be a teacher. She rarely interacts with the outside world, spending her days quietly cultivating the land, raising silkworms, and sewing clothes for others. Her philosophical view on women is: lack of talent is a virtue.

Naturally, she expects the same of Ling Ling and Ah Hua.

Once, my mother asked Ah Hua to thread a needle, but she accidentally dropped it. In extreme anger, my mother coldly issued an order:

"Don't even think about eating until you find it!"

We had finished two meals, and Ah Hua was still squatting on the ground, feeling around. It got dark, but she didn't dare to light a fire for light. In a rush, her cautious little heart began to tearfully sob.

"Cry, and you can forget about it!"

Ling Ling bought a needle and secretly gave it to Ah Hua. I thought the matter would probably be over.

"Oh, good eyesight, you found it! Hmph, you think you can fool my wife, whose eyesight is failing? Skimping and saving, only to indulge like this! Who cares about this thing."

The needle was thrown on the ground, and no one wanted to say another word.

Ah Hua didn't dare to sleep, and was bitten by mosquitoes all night. The next day, red spots appeared on her skin, gradually becoming festered. Ling Ling wanted to apply red mercury on her, but she was afraid of trouble at first, but eventually mustered her courage.

"Don't bother, young mistress, lest I get another scolding from madam. We are born to suffer, we wouldn't even care if we rotted to death." It didn't sound like the words of a child. Ling Ling lanced a few of the pustules.

My mother saw it and glared at Ah Hua venomously.

"Red medicine? The young mistress is so considerate. Ah Hua, you are lucky. This bottle of stuff was left behind by the master. Even my wife is reluctant to use it, and now it's your turn, your turn, you cheap thing!"

Ling Ling finished her meal silently and went to school. I was going to a classmate's house because it was a day to be at school. When I came back in the evening, no one was in the living room, no one was in the study, and even the backyard was empty.

A cry came from the back upstairs:

"Young mistress!… Young master, save me! I'm being beaten to death!… I'm being beaten to death!…"

Then my mother's voice:

"I'll beat you to death, you cheap thing, you, are you eating the rice? Unwilling? Get out! Throwing rice in the river to feed the fish? Forty thousand yuan for a dan of rice, and you, you cheap thing, are only worth three dou of rice! You… you… today, you won't even let me quietly and thoughtfully recite the 'Stove Classic'!… Answering back? What? Still saying you accidentally bumped into madam?…"

I couldn't stop her. A slap landed on Ah Hua's mouth, and her lips immediately swelled high. Another slap, another slap, on her cheeks, nose, eyes, all covered in scarlet blood, covering Ah Hua's face, dripping onto the floorboards.

"You've all spoiled her, beating? It's not like I've never bought maids before. Too young? Fourteen years old is too young? Didn't Qiu Lan also start at fourteen, washing clothes, gathering firewood, doing everything? Maids need to be disciplined, they need to be kept in line! Guidance? Bah, nonsense, look at how you treat your daughters like treasures, your good wife even buys water caltrop to feed her, that's what you call guidance?"

Another slap, another series of blood splatters, falling on the floorboards, glistening…

In the middle of the night, "Ah Hua the person" left like "Ah Hua the dog."

A pool of blood on the floorboards.

A pool of slave's blood.

The Mid-Autumn moon kissed the earth brightly.

### Tagore's Quotes

— Tian Rui

When we are most humble, we are nearest to greatness.

Let the dead have the immortality of fame, but the living the immortality of love.

, where are you? Night is like a black stone. Roaring in the sky… May the fire of love be rekindled to accompany your life.

### Nostalgia

— Yi Feng

In the days without flowers, I miss the flowers; in the cloudy years, I yearn for the sun; on this lonely day! I yearn for the land where my footprints remain.

Clear memories tell me: it has only been four months since I left the mountain city, yet I feel like a child who has just left his mother's embrace, with endless longing for it. I miss the solemn life in the mountain city, I miss the free air in the mountain city, and I especially miss those friends in the mountain city who are working hard today to strive for a beautiful tomorrow. From their hard struggles, I gradually had the doors and windows of my wisdom opened. I began to understand laughter, understand crying, and understand even more the joys and sorrows of life. Therefore, I have love and hate for reality.

Sometimes, due to the whip of life, or the indignation towards reality, I once hated the mountain city, resented the mountain city, and even cursed the mountain city. But looking at it today, these are just childish pranks. It is not my true intention at all, nor will it damage my sincere feelings for it. On the contrary, because of this kind of twist, I feel a deeper nostalgia for it today. Romain Rolland said it well: "We can only have a deep understanding of the people we are close to all day long after we are apart." This is perhaps a depiction of my current mood!

In the nine years of my wandering life, I have spent five years in the mountain city. Five years ago, on a dusk evening, when I first stepped into the mountain city with tired steps, the mountain city was being submerged in the fire of bombing. Although there was no light, I could clearly see, with the help of the red flames, a terrifying and tragic picture dyed with blood: burnt houses, messy corpses, and the overflowing decay on the streets… It almost made me wonder if I had stepped into Dante's purgatory.

Under such destruction, and under such lashes, the mountain city has always accepted the tests of the times and shouldered the mission of history with a solemn and dignified attitude. She has never shown any sign of surrender, nor a single moan of pain. With this, she endured the years of suffering and welcomed the dawn of victory.

The inspiration the mountain city gave me is great and persevering. The training the mountain city gave me is solemn and dignified. In the years of suffering, the people living in the mountain city also had their joy and pride, because they were nurtured in a free atmosphere, breathing sweet and light air. They dared to laugh loudly, cry loudly, call for and accuse when the situation was tense, and sing and praise on the days of victory. In a free and unrestrained environment, they poured out the love and hate in their hearts, and the brilliant light shone on the "Lighthouse of East Asia" by gathering these free voices. …

In the past five years, I have met many friends from all walks of life. Some are civil servants who stick to their posts, some are primary school teachers who work hard on an empty stomach, some are diligent college students… Their environments may not be the same, but their experiences and ideals are exactly the same. They are willing to use their own suffering to build the happiness of the people, and use persistent efforts to exchange for a victorious tomorrow.

These touching scenes have passed, but thinking back, I still feel infinite excitement and concern. I will never forget.

When I first came here, I still held the same pious belief as the pilgrims worshiping Jerusalem. Although I occasionally saw some unpleasant things and felt annoyed, I never had resentment and disappointment. But today, I am in pain, and I feel a chill into my bones. I am lonely, I am alone, I hate this moldy city, so I deeply miss that distant mountain city. Friends in the distance, can you give me some comfort?

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 38

— Ye Jingfeng

How should I put it? I don't need to describe her appearance. You only had to see her return home, and within moments, Changxindian would be buzzing with the news: "Miss Mei has returned to the mansion, our Changxindian is no longer so humble!" The local mothers would have to say to their daughters, "You may not have been born with good looks, and that's your father and mother's fault; and your ancestors didn't have that kind of virtue either; but you have to go to Miss Mei's mansion to get some inspiration, see how she behaves, learn even a tenth of her ways and I won't feel like I raised you in vain!"

Miss Mei was such a good child; she didn't act like a privileged young lady, she didn't adopt the pride of a female student, and she had no temper at all. There was only one old servant woman doing the rough work at home; seven people, cooking, boiling, washing, scrubbing, she couldn't manage it all. Her mother had to spend all day managing the household affairs, mending the torn clothes, adding new fabric to the bigger ones, and altering the old ones for the younger ones. She had to put some thought into it, try some new patterns, otherwise the younger ones would refuse, and protest, saying "the treatment isn't fair." To the outside world, even though the father was poor, he was still a civil servant of some standing, and he had to maintain his image. Plus, he naturally loved to show off, so we children couldn't make him lose face. As a result, Mrs. Wu had to plan and arrange things all day long, so busy she could barely breathe. Can you imagine such a good child as Miss Mei, coming home from school, still acting like a spoiled young lady, putting on airs like a female student?

No. She understood that very well. Every time she came home, whether it was winter vacation, summer vacation, or a holiday, she would get up before dawn, take care of herself, and then help her younger siblings, arranging their homework, and reviewing their lessons; taking apart old velvet ribbons, washing, drying, and winding them into coils, designing and weaving new patterns; if there was new fabric, she would first plan who to add it to; cutting with scissors, using an iron, sewing, mending, shirts, qipaos, underwear, she could do it all, and they all looked good, no doubt about it. Seeing her mother unhappy, she would think of ways to make her laugh. Sometimes when her father was tired, she could even cook herself, even if Changxindian couldn't buy fat fish, big meat, or anything like that, just a few pieces of dried tofu, a packet of peanuts, plus something else, she could make three or two delicious dishes to go with the wine.

"Dad, even though you have such good bones, and you're not too old, you can't overwork yourself, … Have a glass today, it's rare to find such good white liquor in Changxindian, you pay, consider it my treat." She said it so sweetly.

Could the father not accept? "Fen, look how well our child speaks, we pay, and she treats us. … Okay, let's eat hers, come on, Fen, you disturb her for a glass too. I don't want to swallow it all alone, let's all have a sip…"

Fen was the wife's given name, ever since he wrote love letters, she had been his "Fen". Although she was almost forty, the mother of five children, she didn't look her age, and when she dressed up carefully, she really looked like the eldest sister in the family. Good features, good looks, skin like a southerner, but with the healthy frame of a northerner.

"Really," Fen smiled, "Our child was born with such a clever mouth. But then again, you gave the money, that's true, but if she wants to buy flowers, powders, or whatever, could you stop her from using it? Can't this little bit of money be considered her personal savings?…"

With such an eldest daughter, the second daughter, Lanjun, although only thirteen years old, was no exception. If you were to rate the two sisters, the older sister would be excellent, and the younger sister would probably get a "top-top" or "top-middle." If there was a shortcoming, it was that the older brother, Shiren, was somewhat barbaric, liked to play pranks on her, pull her pigtails, trip her, and so on, and she couldn't resist, so she would just shout loudly, "I'm telling Mom!"…

Little Dingxiang, Zhujun, was a little imp; being likeable was her forte. The younger brother, Shiyi, was the family's radio station, singing or loudly imitating this person or that reading from morning to night. If you didn't hear his voice for a few minutes, you could be sure he was up to no good.

All the children were lovely. If you had such a family, even though you were always arguing with the god of poverty, and things were just starting to look a little better, but then the Japanese devils came, with their cannons roaring to the sky, you, if you put yourself in Wu Engineer's shoes, what would you do?

### Chen's Sesame Cakes

— Hong Weifa

Everyone who has lived in Yangzhou for a relatively long time should know that the sesame cakes from Chen Xiao Si's house are very delicious. These sesame cakes, like crab shell yellow, Huizhou cakes, etc., whether sweet or salty, sometimes sold for a dime apiece before the war, but the business became even more prosperous as the price increased. His sesame cake shop was located on Zuo Wei Street, which is the financial district of Yangzhou. The banks and money shops there always thought of his sesame cakes for their daily snacks.

Although the sesame cakes from Chen Xiao Si's house were good, Chen Xiao Si's temper was very bad. Buying sesame cakes from him was like going to the hospital to register for treatment, with first-come, first-served, you had to follow the order. If you tried to jump the line or urge him, he would very impolitely return the money to you: "Please go buy somewhere else." This straightforward behavior was naturally not pleasing, but in order to eat the sesame cakes he made, you had no choice but to obediently follow his lead.

Because his business was booming, he made a lot of money, so he wholeheartedly cultivated his three sons. And he also had a very virtuous wife who could read a few words. As for himself, he could barely read the newspaper and could drink a few cups of wine. Every night, after he stopped working, he would first read the newspaper, and then leisurely drink his wine. He often looked at his virtuous wife and good sons with hazy, drunken eyes, and had beautiful dreams. He felt that the sesame cakes he made every day were like square bricks, constantly paving a smooth road, which would eventually lead him to a state of happiness. He thought: Can't the hard work of the present be exchanged for the happiness of the future? But for thirty years, this good dream of his completely woke up. Looking back now, what a tragic nightmare it was!

The nightmare unfolded like this. After his eldest son finished elementary school, he was introduced to work as a trainee in the telephone bureau, and was promoted from trainee to operator. This was the first bridge for him to reach a state of happiness, so of course he was very happy. Who would have thought that this eldest son would die of tuberculosis! Then his very virtuous wife, who could read a few words, also left him forever due to the attack of tuberculosis. This really gave him a great trauma to his soul. But this great trauma gradually healed with time. Originally, his second son graduated from middle school and went on to university, and after graduating from university, he became a middle school teacher. Everyone knew that the position of middle school teacher was much higher than the operator that his eldest son had once been. And his third son actually went to university and even managed to struggle to Japan to study literature. Weren't these two more reliable bridges to lead him to a state of happiness?

But Chen Xiao Si had no idea that his third son in Japan also had tuberculosis and died in Japan a few years before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. His second son did not dare to tell him this bad news, fearing that he would not be able to withstand this blow, but he was always worried about himself, worried that the devil of tuberculosis would also attack. Then the Anti-Japanese War began, and the flames of war quickly burned to this ancient city of Yangzhou. His second son, with tears in his eyes, followed the thousands of people who fled to the rear. He always thought that one day he could bring victory home to comfort his hardworking old father, and then tell him the bad news of his younger brother who had died in Japan. Because the period of the Anti-Japanese War was too long, his second son did not wait for the arrival of victory, and worry became reality, and he was also swallowed by the devil of tuberculosis. In this way, Chen Xiao Si's beautiful dream ended, revealing a tragic nightmare.

Chen Xiao Si's two sons deaths, Chen Xiao Si probably know the full truth of it now, after the war. A few years before the Anti-Japanese War, because his second son had already become a middle school teacher, and his income was enough to maintain the family life, he no longer made sesame cakes, and let others open the sesame cake shop. But recently, he started making sesame cakes again in the same place. This is like a famous actor who has been retired for a long time suddenly going back on stage, and the business will still be prosperous. It's just that he no longer has any beautiful dreams. Now in front of him are the widowed daughter-in-law and granddaughter, what else can he have? Or rather, what hopes does he dare to place on them! He is only busy maintaining the cost of living for the few mouths who were fortunately abandoned by the devil of tuberculosis. The sesame cakes he makes by hand seem to have transformed into bricks for building his own tomb. He struggled on the road of life for decades, but was defeated by tuberculosis, and defeated very badly. He himself did not expect it, and neither did the people who liked to eat his sesame cakes. Thinking about it, his sesame cakes now probably have many bloody tears stained in them, but who will taste this different flavor! (Yangzhou Continued Dreams 12)

### Engineering Talents

— Shao Fu

If people cannot use their talents to the fullest, there is no way to talk about social progress.

There were two senior engineers, last August in Chongqing, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. I saw that they were both very excited, busy doing this and that, always thinking that engineers should dedicate their skills, but unexpectedly, in the year since the victory, they have been unemployed for a year. The authorities established a temporary agency, letting them do paperwork without any real effect. It seemed to be considerate and intended to provide for their old age.

There was also a group of engineers who were sent to the United States for internship. They recently returned to China. More than forty of them have been delayed in Shanghai. They are not living as rentiers, because they were mostly civil servants in the past and have not made a fortune, but are living in apartments waiting for work. The factories in the United States once wanted to keep these people, but they were not greedy for life in the United States. Their motherland cultivated them, and they resolutely returned, ready to serve their motherland.

According to ordinary human sentiment, these experts should be "undiscriminating in their choice of food" in their hunger, but I know that in Shanghai, they have neither been tempted by foreign merchants, nor have they turned to any business idea, nor have they shown any negativity. Every day they are collecting engineering information from various places, planning this road, planning that port. This scene may be considered by some people to be the attitude of bookworms, but those who are bookworms have to admit the impact of these people on society and their weight.

Good people can withstand tempering, and society is not blind. We are moved by the actions of these people, admire them, and hope that the government will not let them idle for too long.

### Whose Hong Kong?

— Jin Xia

On the 14th of this month, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government issued a statement denying that Kowloon City is still Chinese territory. (According to the "Beijing Treaty" of 1898, "The Chinese officials stationed in Kowloon City shall still be able to perform their duties in the city." I don't know if this spokesman is forgetful, or if the treaty has another interpretation?

At the general meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 16th of this month, a resolution was unanimously passed: requesting our government to negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau.

In fact, as early as February 7 this year, the standing committee of the Guangdong Provincial Council had already made the same resolution, and had telegraphed the government to negotiate with the British, but we have not heard any further news?

Sir Stafford Cripps, leader of the British Labour Party, declared in London on December 19 last year: Britain should quickly and "magnanimously" return Hong Kong to its original owner, in exchange for the lasting friendship of a broad China, and to enhance Britain's moral position and prestige in Asia.

It can be seen that this person's vision and insight are sharper than our senators'. Unfortunately, there are not many British people with a clear mind like Sir Stafford.

After our country's victory, the British built an airport near Pingshan in Kowloon, turning twenty villages, dozens of households, 10,000 mu of fields, and more than 20,000 villagers into flat ground, leaving them homeless. Our government protested, but I don't know what the real situation is at present?

In the international sense, the importance of the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue is at least equal to that of the Northeast!

Shifting our attention to Hong Kong, we can see—

Hong Kong has a population of over one million, of which 92 percent are Chinese. According to the Health Bureau's estimate, the number of rats in Hong Kong is equal to the population.

Opium, alcohol, horse racing, dance halls, prostitution, and other entertainment venues are all available. The pleasure consumption of the wealthy alone is often over HK$10 million per year.

Alcohol tax, tobacco tax, and betting tax (including horse racing and other gambling), and entertainment tax account for a large portion of the Hong Kong government's budget revenue.

Between July and August this year—more than a hundred wealthy merchants moved from our country to Hong Kong, and funds of HK$100 million poured into Hong Kong, prospering Hong Kong and weakening our country's economy.

Hong Kong is a paradise for the upper-class Chinese.

Some people also say: it is a paradise built on hell.

I think it is precisely a blood-drawing needle inserted into our country's veins!

### Shaoxing Opera and Killing a Husband

— Chi Mo

Zhan Zhou Shi, who killed her own husband, has now been sentenced to death. She was trembling when she heard the verdict.

A reporter asked her, "How did you know that the body could be put in a box?"

She quickly replied, "I saw it in Shaoxing opera (Yue opera)."

Yes, she was not lying. There are several Shaoxing operas where women throw male corpses into boxes. The ones that can often be seen are "Borrowing the Red Lantern." In "Borrowing the Red Lantern," the body of "Lin Fengchun" is also hidden in a box. There is also "Jade Dragonfly" with "Shen Guisheng," and many other operas. I don't need to introduce them one by one here.

Moreover, the women in Shaoxing operas who throw dead people into boxes all become first-rank ladies in the end, and none of them are sued.

This time, Zhan Zhou Shi is not only being sued, but she will also be shot or hanged. Isn't Shaoxing opera harming her?

Science Knowledge

### On Hair Perms

— Jia Ling

American science advances rapidly, and the cosmetics industry also changes with each passing day. Ladies' "cream perms" can now be replaced by "cold perms." This type of "cold perm" requires neither electricity nor a perm machine. It can be done anywhere, anytime, truly simple, convenient, and safe.

You don't have to rush to the barber shop or beauty salon; you can just buy two types of hair curling solution at your home and start the "cold perm." First, carefully wash your hair, removing all scalp oil and dirt. Then, use the first solution, which will cause the hair to naturally wrinkle and curl, allowing you to create any desired style. Then use the second solution to fix it. A beautiful and novel curly hairstyle is produced. Finally, wash away the remaining solution, and the "cold perm" is complete. Several cosmetics companies have been producing this type of curling solution for some time, but it is likely restricted by customs regulations and has not yet been marketed in our country. Of course, we also don't hope it comes!

To put it bluntly, this trick is not mysterious at all, but merely a chemical and physical change. The first solution contains Ammonium Thioglycollate, and the second solution is simply acidified hydrogen peroxide.

Originally, 15% of the protein in our hair is Cystine. Those who have studied chemistry know that a Cystine molecule is formed by two amino acids linked by two sulfur atoms. These constantly interwoven Cystine chains give the hair its unique shape and properties. If the -S-S- of Cystine is cut off, then the hair can be changed into any curve and shape, no longer adhering to its original form. The Ammonium Thioglycollate in the first solution of the perm can reduce -S-S- to two -SH Cysteine. The acidified hydrogen peroxide causes the rearranged Cysteine to recombine into Cystine. Thus, the curl is formed, stable and lasting, just like natural.

### Statistics

— Xin Fang

Six years of primary school, based on the lowest tuition fees for Shanghai primary schools today, twelve semesters would cost 1.2 million yuan.

Six years of middle school, at 150,000 yuan per semester, twelve semesters would cost 1.8 million yuan.

Four years of university, at a minimum of 200,000 yuan per semester, four years would cost 1.6 million yuan.

A university graduate who has studied for sixteen years would have spent 4.6 million yuan on tuition over those sixteen years. If calculated at the lowest interest rate of 10%, 4.6 million yuan would yield 460,000 yuan per month. But I ask, can a university graduate just entering society today find a "job" that earns 460,000 yuan per month?

Current Affairs Musings

### Zhou Fohai is Here: Watch the Grand Finale

— Yu Ren

Let's hear his confession!

Chen Gongbo was executed by firing squad, Chu Minyi was executed by firing squad, Mei Shiping was executed by firing squad... Several major traitors have almost been judged or have died. Thus, everyone is thinking even more of those "Lord Zhou Fohai" and "Lord Luo Daqingtian" and others who were far away in Chongqing. There has been no news of them for a while. Not long ago, the newspapers even said that they were riding in jeeps and frequenting dance halls in Chongqing, "their demeanor undiminished from their earlier days," which made people even more confused.

But don't rush! Have you watched Peking opera? The opening is always some insignificant acts, and the famous actors naturally only appear at the end. Now, all the major traitors have been dealt with, and it is precisely the time for these few "surviving" "tycoons of treason" to take the stage. Thus, a plane sent them to the Ninghai Road Detention Center in Nanjing.

Among the names of the five major traitors: Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and Luo Junqiang are naturally "renowned" and need no introduction; and there are two others! Ma Jiliang and Yang Qiuhua were both subordinates of the traitor Zhou. This time, the five men "returned to the capital" by plane, carrying hundreds of pieces of luggage, countless gold bars and gold ingots, and several attendants and servants. The demeanor of "ministers" is, after all, extraordinary!

Everyone is watching the opening of this grand finale, expecting a wonderful performance. In court, they may talk eloquently: how they loved the country, how they "endured humiliation and bore heavy burdens," how they "covered up underground work," and that they even "surrendered" a few days before the victory! However, there are eighteen twisted arguments, but there is only one principle of justice in the world: "Death to traitors!" Everyone should wait and see: when they are escorted to the execution ground one day, let them go to "rest in peace"!

News Figures

### Senior Figure in Journalism: Mr. Shao Lizi

— You Nan

Among the famous figures of the Party and State, the one with the most interesting anecdotes and stories is Mr. Shao Lizi. Mr. Shao was a successful candidate in the late Qing imperial examinations, worked as a teacher, served as a newspaper editor, and was also a Communist Party member who was expelled from the party, a private secretary, a provincial chairman, an ambassador, a propaganda minister, a university president, and an army major general... His titles and experiences, if printed in six-point type, could fill an entire card.

The Wind Blows the Willow's Hair

In order to prevent omissions, let's start from the beginning and recount Mr. Shao's past anecdotes. Mr. Shao's given name was Wen Tai, his courtesy name was Zhonghui, and Lizi was just his pen name. He was from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and was known as a "prodigy" and "little Cao Zhi" for his intelligence and love of learning since childhood. When he was twelve years old, a father's colleague visited him and jokingly said, "Since you have the name of a prodigy, let me give you a couplet to match. If you answer well, I will give you ten yuan for you to buy something to eat." He gave the first line, "Raindrops wash the face of flowers," and Shao casually replied, "The wind blows the willow's hair." The father's colleague was greatly amazed and immediately rewarded him with ten gold coins. At the age of fourteen, he entered the local school as a scholar, and at sixteen he passed the imperial examinations.

In the late Qing Dynasty, Yu Youren founded a normal school in Chang'an, and Shao was hired as a professor. In the first year of the Republic, he joined the Minli Bao as an editor, and later served as an editor for the Minguo Ribao, Shenghuo Ribao, and Juewu Bao. At that time, the Minguo Ribao was short of funds, and had cut back to the point where there was nothing left to cut. It was even unable to afford out-of-town special dispatches. But a dignified newspaper could not be without special dispatches. Shao, in desperation, used his quick wit and went to the Xin Shenbao (editor's note: not the "Xin Shenbao" of the enemy-puppet era.) every evening to visit his friend Sun Dongwu, the chief editor. They would chat and laugh, appearing carefree, but in fact, when Sun was reading the special dispatches, Shao would watch carefully and memorize them all. After saying goodbye and returning to his office, he would immediately sit at his desk and write, changing the wording and sending out the special dispatches from various places as usual. He did so without missing a single detail. Shao's memory and quick wit can be seen from this.

A Heavily Made-Up Old Woman

Shao and the late Central Committee member Ye Chucang shared a room at the Minguo Ribao office. At that time, the office was located next to the Lao Yangqing He Silver Shop. When they had nothing to do, the two often looked out the window at the female customers entering and leaving the silver shop. Ye once recited a limerick: "Having the fragrant neighbor Yangqing He, I watch the beautiful women morning and night." Shao continued, saying, "Sometimes I strain my neck in vain, and encounter a heavily made-up old woman." Shao's early humor and talent were originally in the nature of a scholar, so it is not surprising!

Before long, Shao joined the Communist Party and was elected as a member of the Central Committee. In the fifteenth year, he was expelled from the party. Shao also published a notice in the newspaper at the same time announcing his separation from the Communist Party. Just then, Chairman Chiang admired his great talent and hired him as his secretary, respecting him as he would a good teacher and friend. During his time at the newspaper, Shao advocated revolution but did not suffer imprisonment. Unexpectedly, in the fourteenth year, when he served as the major general director of the political department of the Whampoa Military Academy, he experienced a night in jail. Shao had just arrived at Whampoa when President Chiang set off on the Second Eastern Expedition. Shao and his guards rushed to meet him. When they arrived in Dongguan, Shao was detained overnight by the military police because the license number of the guards' firearms did not match. This was Shao's first trip south, and he was unknown, so it happened. He was released on bail by the school the next day.

Having Been to the Soviet Union

In the twenty-first year, Shao served as the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, in the twenty-fifth year as the chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and in the twenty-ninth year as the ambassador to the Soviet Union. Shao had twice gone to the Soviet Union for inspection in the fourteenth and seventeenth years. In the nineteenth year, Shao held his wedding in the capital, and his wife, Ms. Chuan Xuewen, was whom Shao met during his travels in the Soviet Union. Before serving as ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shao served as the Minister of Central Propaganda, which was his old profession, so he was of course competent and outstanding.

Shao has a fondness for collecting books, and his collection mostly consists of classics on party history, archaeology, and the like. It is said that he has a habit of picking his feet and must do so every day, which can truly be called an eccentric habit of an elegant man. I wonder if he suffers from "Hong Kong foot"?

Shao is already sixty-three years old, but since the victory, he has been busy running around for unity. He is truly a respectable elder!

### Habit

— Hong Yin

Habit is an extremely terrible and extremely lovely thing; when a bad behavior becomes a habit, one may suffer from it for life and be unable to change it; conversely, when a good behavior becomes a habit, you will unconsciously benefit from it for life, and it will become your most loyal companion, which you cannot drive away even if you try!
