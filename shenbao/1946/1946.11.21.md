[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] After the Central Standing Committee adjourned on the afternoon of the 20th, the Supreme National Defense Council held a temporary meeting, presided over by Chairman Chiang, to discuss the "Draft Amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law" submitted by the Chairman. The content is to change the Ministry of Communications into two ministries, the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. The Land Administration and Health Administrations and the Water Conservancy Commission were all changed to specialized ministries, and in accordance with the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, political commissioners were established within the Executive Yuan, increasing the total to eighteen ministries and commissions. The full text was slightly revised and passed, and the meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM. The full text of the proposal is recorded below:

(Submission Proposal) Due to the excessive workload of the Ministry of Communications, it is proposed to establish two ministries, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Transportation. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications shall be in charge of postal and telecommunications matters, and the Ministry of Transportation shall be in charge of water, land, and air transportation matters. Furthermore, due to the importance of water conservancy, health, and land administration affairs at the beginning of national construction, it is proposed to change the Water Conservancy Commission, the Land Administration, and the Health Administration into specialized ministries in order to improve administrative efficiency.

The establishment of the ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan was originally contained in Article 1 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law. It is now proposed to amend the wording of that article accordingly, and to include the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference on the establishment of political commissioners in the Executive Yuan in Article 2. The Resources Commission has already been transferred, and should also be added. The remaining articles in the Executive Yuan Organization Law pertain to the internal organization of the Executive Yuan, and it seems appropriate to follow the draft amendment prepared by the Executive Yuan in December of last year. As for the remaining points related to the Executive Yuan in the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, they should be stipulated in the National Government Organization Law as a matter of practice, and there is no need to repeat them in the Executive Yuan Organization Law. After the draft amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law is submitted for public decision, it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and submitted to the Government for promulgation and implementation.

### Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense States That the Attack on Yan'an is Groundless; The Communist Side Declares That the War Has Begun

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense stated on the 20th that reports in the foreign press that the National Army was attacking Yan'an were completely groundless.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] A spokesman for the Communist Party Office stated on the evening of the 20th that, according to Peng Dehuai's announcement, the Government Army around Yan'an has reached 100,000 people, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is surrounded on the north, south, and west sides. On the southern front is the 165th Brigade and the 123rd Brigade of Hu Zongnan's forces, in the central area of Luochuan. The First Division and the 49th Division are in Jicheng and Yichuan. The Northern front was originally the 22nd Army, in Yulin and Shenmu. Finally, the 28th Brigade was airlifted from Xianyang to Yulin. On the two lines, Ma Hongkui's 82nd Division, a cavalry brigade, and three local security teams are gathered in Lingwu. The Western front began at 11:00 PM on the 17th, the Northern front began on the 16th, and the Southern front began on the 13th. Yan'an is in a state of extreme tension, preparing for war at any time. This is a war that has never occurred in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region since October 1935. This war not only exists, but has already begun. As for reports that Zhu De and Mao Zedong have left Yan'an, they are not accurate.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Communist spokesman Mei Yi officially announced that the National Army has launched a pincer offensive against the Yan'an area, signaling the government's greatest attempt to eliminate the CCP. Mei said that the four brigades of Feng Hongkui's troops, with 40,000 men, launched an attack on Yan'an from Yanchi, 140 miles west of Yan'an, on the evening of the 17th, and said that Hu Zongnan's troops had a minor contact with the Communist Army on the southern border of the Yan'an area on the 13th. Zhou Enlai said at a press conference on the 16th that if the government attacks Yan'an, the CCP will withdraw from Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, and other places, and close the Military Mediation Headquarters. Local people here believe that after the outbreak of all-out civil war, the CCP will carry out underground work throughout the country, and at the same time, the "Yan'an people" will launch another "Long March" to Mongolia and the Northeast.

[Another Cable] Yan'an Radio broadcast on the 20th that the advance troops of the National Army have broken into the Yan'an border area by 19 miles and have had contact with the Communist Army, which is the prelude to a large-scale offensive by the National Army against the Red Capital.

### Ye Jianying Remains in Beiping

Other Communist Party Personnel Have Withdrawn

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Ye Jianying visited Liang Shuming on the morning of the 20th and said goodbye to Liang.

Only the small groups remaining in Taiyuan, Dongqin, and Houma in Guan Nei will gradually withdraw. The Communist side of the Changchun Military Mediation Sub-department has also decided to withdraw the personnel of the Northeast group to Harbin. It is heard that government and US personnel of the Changchun Sub-department received a notice from Wu Xiuquan, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party, on the 19th. At the same time, the government is also considering the withdrawal of government personnel from the Northeast group.

### Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Questions: Seats for Communist Party and Democratic League Representatives in the National Assembly Will Be Reserved; Pacification Zone Political Affairs Conference Concludes Today

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 3:30 PM today in the National Assembly Party Representatives Lounge. Peng Xuepei, Shen Yi, Ye Gongchao, Mr. Baer, and two hundred Chinese and foreign journalists attended. Peng first introduced the newly appointed Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, who reported on the preliminary administrative guidelines for Nanjing. He then answered reporters' questions, and the meeting adjourned around 5 PM. The following is a record of Minister Peng's answers:

Question: The spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has stated that the National Army is frequently moving in northern Shaanxi, and aircraft are flying over Yan'an from time to time. The highway north of Xi'an is also being actively repaired. Is it true that the National Army is about to attack Yan'an?

Answer: This kind of atmosphere may be a propaganda tactic and a precursor to action, which is related to the newly established Action Committee of the CCP. Yulin has been surrounded for weeks, and communication relies solely on the air force, so it must pass over Yan'an. As for repairing the highway, that is a nationwide undertaking, and transportation north of Xi'an cannot be excluded.

Question: Please tell us frankly whether the government is planning to attack Yan'an?

Answer: The previous answer already gave a negative response.

Question: It is rumored that Chairman Chiang recently convened a meeting of senior National Army generals from various regions, where he stated that the Communist forces would be eliminated in five months and communism would be eradicated from China in five years. Is this true?

Answer: This rumor may refer to the recent Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee meeting. Premier Song and Minister Bai served as the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee, respectively. Their task was to plan for the rehabilitation and relief of the pacification zones. Attendees included personnel from relevant central ministries and commissions, as well as military and political leaders from various pacification zones. It was not a meeting of all senior generals; for example, Chief of Staff Chen did not attend. The Chairman did address the meeting, but such speculation about the content of the address is not worth denying. The meeting has continued for three days and will conclude on the 21st.

Question: Does the government know whether Chairman Chiang exchanged documents with Zhang Junmai?

Answer: Exchanging letters is a normal matter. However, I can tell you that it is very likely that the China Democratic Socialist Party will attend the National Assembly. Looking back to the establishment of the first National Political Council in 1938, the members of the council, in addition to those who were non-partisan, were mainly from the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the China Youth Party, and the China Democratic Socialist Party (formerly the National Socialist Party). Later, the Democratic League was established, mainly composed of the China Youth Party and the China Democratic Socialist Party, supplemented by educational organizations and a few individuals. The current situation is similar to that of 1938. Only the Communist Party opposes participating in the National Assembly.

### Sino-British Trade Treaty Under Negotiation; Our Side is Studying the Draft; Government Has Not Yet Taken Over Dalian City

Ye Gongchao Answers Reporters' Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Ye Gongchao, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported on the recent situation, Sino-British commercial negotiations, and the implementation negotiations of the Sino-French Vietnam Agreement at a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists this afternoon. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Question: A Beiping telegram reports that Soviet troops have withdrawn from Dalian and that Chinese Communist troops have taken over. Have Soviet troops withdrawn, what is the situation in Dalian, and what news does the Chinese government have?

Answer: Regarding this matter, the Chinese government has not received a report. The Soviet government informed our country on May 23 of this year that Soviet troops had completed their withdrawal from the Northeast on May 3. Since then, there should be no more Soviet troops stationed in Dalian, because the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed last August does not allow the Soviet Union to station troops in Dalian. The Dalian area is still occupied by the Communist forces. The Chinese government has not taken over Dalian, so there is no other news.

Question: What is the situation with Sino-British commercial negotiations?

Answer: Regarding the Sino-British negotiation of a trade and related treaty, the British side submitted a draft to the Chinese government six months ago. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying the draft. Some clauses in the draft involve other relevant government departments, and all parties are studying the relevant clauses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes to complete this study by the end of this month, but it may take slightly longer due to the wide scope involved. However, the Chinese government and the British government both hope that the treaty will be completed as soon as possible.

Question: Regarding the Sino-French Vietnam negotiations, the former Yunnan Provincial Council put forward six points of opinion. What is the situation with the implementation negotiations of the Sino-French Vietnam Agreement?

Answer: Sino-French negotiations can be described in four key points: (1) Recovering the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is a consistent government policy. The government has always valued the opinions of all parties in foreign negotiations, and the opinions of the Yunnan Provincial Council are certainly valued by the government. (2) The issue of Haiphong Port as a free port is being negotiated with the French side, and progress has been made. Success is absolutely hopeful. (3) Compensation for wartime cross-border public and private property losses is being negotiated. Because it involves investigation, valuation, currency value determination, and other issues, it will take longer. (4) Regarding the protection of overseas Chinese, the government is paying close attention. At the same time, the government is also negotiating with both France and Vietnam. After the negotiations have achieved results, the overseas Chinese will not only be protected after implementation, but will also enjoy better treatment than before. This can be asserted.

### Shen Yi Reports on Nanjing's Administrative Guidelines at Press Conference, Proceeding Based on the Principle of "Keeping the Big Picture in Mind and Starting with Small Details"

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, reported on the preliminary administrative guidelines at the Central Propaganda Department's press conference on the 20th, stating that the municipal construction will be carried out based on the principle of "keeping the big picture in mind and starting with small details." The big picture is to complete the general preparations for local autonomy and urban planning. Small details include repairing roads and waterways. The medium-sized picture is to facilitate transportation and solve housing shortages and school shortages. The very small details include cleaning up slums and remote areas, and even adding public toilets. He also said that the conditions for successful administration are the diligent efforts of municipal government officials, the sincere assistance of citizens, the understanding and support of the central government, and the guidance and supervision of public opinion. He then answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: What is the construction goal of Nanjing, Chinese style or Western style, or a combination of Chinese and Western styles?

Answer: Regardless of Chinese or Western, the goal is a modern city.

Question: What is Mayor Shen's view on banning dancing in Nanjing?

Answer: This is a very minor matter in municipal administration. Since all parties are paying attention, and the Municipal Council will also discuss it, we should first listen to everyone's opinions.

Question: Nanjing's finances are difficult, and income and expenditure cannot be balanced. What plans does Mayor Shen have?

Answer: Thank you for your concern about the difficulty of Nanjing's unbalanced income and expenditure. It cannot be resolved by simply discussing taxes, but we must find a way to resolve it.

### Trial Begins in Case of Hong Kong Police Kicking a Hawker to Death; Evidence Against Perpetrator Conclusive; May Be Acquitted Under Protection of British Law

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] The trial of Indian police officer Seth for kicking Chinese peanut hawker Wang Shuixiang to death began this afternoon. The courtroom was crowded with spectators and heavily guarded. Four Chinese were called to testify, one of whom testified that the defendant police officer kicked the deceased ten times after he fell to the ground. Dr. Halliwell of the Hong Kong Government Hospital confirmed that Wang Shuixiang's death was caused by internal bleeding and a ruptured spleen. Dr. Halliwell also stated that the bruises on Wang Shuixiang's body were undoubtedly caused by the leather boots worn by the defendant.

Based on the prosecutor's indictment and the testimony of witnesses, it is possible that the defendant may be acquitted or receive only a minor punishment under the protection of the British court. The prosecutor first said that he would only present the facts of the case to the court, and said that there were contradictions between the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, and it was up to the court to judge. When questioning the police officer who was responsible for examining the deceased's body, the prosecutor raised the question that the bruises on the deceased's body may have been caused by falling on a peanut basket. The deceased died because his spleen was four times its normal size and ruptured, and he could have been saved if he had been sent to the hospital earlier. The case was adjourned until the afternoon of the 20th for retrial.

### Taipei's Major Thief Wu Shengcai Captured While Watching a Movie; One of the "Twelve Constellations," Nicknamed "Dog;" Secret Agents Discovered Him and Surrounded Him During the Movie

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Wu Shengcai, a well-known major thief in Taipei City, was recently arrested while watching the American detective film "The Invisible Thief" at the Xinmin Theater. There are twelve famous major thieves in Taipei City, known as the "Twelve Constellations." Wu Shengcai is one of the Twelve Constellations, nicknamed "Dog." The nicknames of the other eleven are "Pig," "Ox," "Sheep," etc. They formed a gang to commit robberies, and the number of cases is countless. Wu Shengcai is especially vicious. Two months ago, he confronted the military police and injured one police officer. The two theaters here have been showing both parts of "The Invisible Thief" for days. The protagonist of the film, named "Ghost," is a terrifying and unprecedented major thief. He uses a new scientific invention, a radio wave machine, to become invisible and commit robberies, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and no one can see or defeat him. Wu Shengcai was clearly interested in this "American Major Thief," so he sneaked into the Xinmin Theater to watch the play. Not long after entering, he was discovered by secret agents of the police station. However, when more than 20 military police rushed to surround him, he jumped out of the theater, climbed onto the roof, and fired four shots to demonstrate his resistance to arrest. Later, seeing that the military police were all around and there was no way to escape, he returned to the theater, took off his clothes, and hid under the seat. At this time, he was found. The American Major Thief in the film was ultimately electrocuted to death. He is now imprisoned and will likely die as well.

Analysis of Implementation Key Points by the Ministry of National Defense

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense, in view of the State Council's promulgation and implementation of the new Military Service Law, and to eliminate doubts for all executive agencies when handling military service matters, offers the following analysis: (1) For counties and cities that have completed the investigation of eligible men and women, strict implementation should be carried out in accordance with Article 19 of the Military Service Law; (2) Counties and cities that have completed the investigation of eligible men should complete conscription within the expedited period.

### Relocating Unemployed Military Officers at the Chongqing Chairman's Headquarters

### Editorial: Establishing a New National Ethos

Since the Legislative Yuan temporarily suspended the deliberation of the constitutional draft amendment due to procedural issues, various parties have paid great attention to the constitutional draft issue. The drafting of the constitutional draft amendment was originally based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Whether or not this amendment will be submitted to the National Assembly is not only related to the government's credibility but also to the future of the overall situation. Therefore, this newspaper previously published an opinion on the constitutional draft issue, believing that the drafting of a Three Principles of the People constitution had no precedent to follow, and everything was an initial creation. The drafting of the May 5th Constitution took great effort and fully reflected the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, but whether the system it established, in light of the evolution of the past ten years, especially the recent few years, is the most ideal is also questionable. As for the amended constitutional draft that the government intends to submit to the National Assembly this time, while adhering to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, it still upholds the solemn stance of the Three Principles of the People and should serve as the basis for the National Assembly to formulate the constitution. As for procedural issues, as long as the Central Executive Committee makes a resolution, it can be made compliant with the regulations in a timely manner.

Now, the constitutional draft amendment has indeed been passed by the Central Executive Committee and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for rapid completion of the legislative process. At the same time, the amended National Government Organization Law was also passed; the Supreme National Defense Council also passed the amended Executive Yuan Organization Law; the contents of each bill all comply with the spirit of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The passage of these bills, on the one hand, can enable the Legislative Yuan to deliberate on the constitutional draft amendment in accordance with the statutory procedures, complete the deliberation in a timely manner, and submit it to the National Assembly; on the other hand, it is showing the people of the country how the government intends to abide by and implement the resolutions passed by the Political Consultative Conference. All absurd rumors will be refuted by the Central Executive Committee's resolution this time. The government values its own promises and will not easily allow them to be changed. Unless it is on the basis of its own stance, the Central Government's lack of self-opinion should really move people from all parties and factions, even those without party affiliation. The outdated concept of "believing in our ideology before becoming our citizens" may still linger in the minds of some people, but it cannot represent a political group that is fair to the world. It is those political groups that superficially advocate democracy but actually lack individual freedom and value collectivism that have such a terrible concept.

The amended National Government Organization Law passed by the Central Executive Committee stipulates that the Chairman of the National Government will be elected by the Central Executive Committee and establishes forty members of the National Government, including people from both within and outside the party, and expands the power of the National Government Committee. At the same time, the amended Executive Yuan Organization Law passed by the Supreme National Defense Council, in addition to changing the Ministry of Transportation to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, establishes three new ministries: Land Administration, Water Conservancy, and Health, and also establishes Political Councilors. All of these resolutions are in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; it can be seen here that the government is determined to abide by and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Due to the passage of these amendments, the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan to accommodate people from all parties and factions, even those without party affiliation, will be accelerated. We hope that all parties can cooperate more sincerely from now on, so that the organization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan can be more substantial, so as to establish a new model of democratic unity, and the future of the nation will be brighter from now on.

### Neglecting the Rectification of Border Administration is Unacceptable

When the domestic situation is presenting new opportunities due to the convening of the National Assembly, we must not neglect the news and intentions from the border regions. The other day, the National Assembly's Inner Mongolian representatives, all Inner Mongolian Councilors of the National Political Council, and other Mongolian and Xinjiang people gathered in Beijing, issued a declaration, demanding autonomy, and requesting the Central Government to thoroughly implement the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's resolutions on border administration and to revitalize border administration. At the same time, according to a message from the Associated Press from Los Angeles, it is said that the Xinjiang rebels are stirring again, and the old dream of the "People's Republic of East Turkestan" has been revived. The accuracy of this report, which comes from Los Angeles across the Pacific Ocean, is questionable. In our judgment, the former report inevitably exaggerates and is not necessarily credible; but since there is such a report, it is indeed worthy of our vigilance.

The need for us to attach importance to our border administration does not need to be emphasized by us. Xinjiang and Mongolia are the barriers to the north and northwest of our country and should be worthy of our attention at this time. In the past eight years, some parts of Mongolia and Xinjiang were occupied and suffered the bitter taste of aggression by Japanese militarists. When the Japanese bandits surrendered, they were subjected to the rule of armed forces other than the National Army and the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, when they were celebrating the restoration of the country, they suffered another evil burden of violent rule. Therefore, we should express our utmost sympathy and comfort to our compatriots in Mongolia and Xinjiang. The central government paid attention to the border people, and after Japan surrendered last year, it sent a Mongolian Flag Comforting Mission. Due to the recent developments in the situation, the Mongolian and Xinjiang areas have inevitably suffered from unrest. According to news from foreign news agencies, one said that the Outer Mongolian troops are concentrating near the border of Chahar Province; and the other said that the Outer Mongolian Military Command is taking strict measures to prevent anyone from crossing the border from Chahar Province and entering Outer Mongolia. Although the veracity of this news is still to be confirmed, the unrest in the Mongolian border situation seems undeniable.

At this time, we see Mongolian people calling for autonomy. According to reports, the Mongolian compatriots' demand for autonomy is not for division, but for the government to fulfill the promises it has made to the Mongolian people time and time again. We believe that this sentence comes from the hearts of the Mongolian Flag compatriots. The Mongolian Flag compatriots face Outer Mongolia across the Gobi Desert and know more about the real situation in Outer Mongolia. They also know the violent rule of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, their psychology is inward, not division. We admire the Mongolian Flag compatriots for being able to express themselves so frankly. The Central Government has important resolutions on attention to border administration in the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. One is that under the principle of forming a unified democratic country based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, the Constitution must clearly stipulate the guarantee of the autonomy of the border ethnic groups; the other is that the members of the National Government and the political affairs members of the Executive Yuan after the reorganization must have the participation of the loyal cadres of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups; the third is that the talented people of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups must have sufficient opportunities to participate in the actual work of various ministries and commissions; the fourth is to reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee into the Border Administration Department, so that the capable cadres of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups can participate in actual work and assume actual responsibilities; the fifth is that in the education in the areas where the border ethnic groups live, attention should be paid to the writing of their own ethnic groups, and the autonomous systems in the border areas should be reasonably regulated according to the actual situation of each place, and with regard to the Inner Mongolian part, the original Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee should be restored, and the powers of the alliance flag government and the provincial and county boundaries should be clearly divided. Regarding all these decisions, this newspaper once wrote an article and commented on it, believing that "the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang this time, in addition to expanding the opportunities for border compatriots to participate in the central government, focus on supporting the autonomy of border compatriots and safeguarding the inherent cultural life of border compatriots, which not only shows the central government's concern for border compatriots, but also opens up a broad avenue for their future development." What is regrettable is that after the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the domestic situation still failed to move towards peace, resulting in the failure to implement the previous decisions; now that the situation has changed and the Mongolian compatriots have demands for autonomy, they are calling on the central government to implement the decisions. We support the central government's concern for the border people and sympathize with the plight of the Mongolian compatriots. Therefore, we hope that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang on border administration will be gradually implemented in a timely manner, so as to comfort the hopes of the border people.

As for the Xinjiang part, the news from the United States is not necessarily credible, as mentioned earlier. But we cannot but say again that in order to coordinate the border people and stabilize the border, the Central Government, based on the Three Principles of the People of the revolution, signed eleven articles of the reconciliation terms of the Yining dispute in January this year, and established two supplementary articles in June this year. At the same time, it expanded the organization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, with members from all ethnic groups living in Xinjiang. It can be seen that the central government is doing its best to support border people's autonomy and is satisfying all the wishes of the border people that can be satisfied. This enlightened policy should be supported by all the border people. Therefore, how to harmonize all ethnic groups, eliminate suspicion, and achieve sincere cooperation should be the center of the joint efforts of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Because of the transmission of the aforementioned reports, we reiterate our views and hope that the people of the country will encourage each other.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] Chairman Shen is scheduled to travel to Wenzhou and Taizhou via Shanghai Haidao on Tuesday, the 26th, for a month-long inspection. After returning to Hangzhou, he plans to inspect Xinchang and other counties, and in January next year, he will travel to the counties under the jurisdiction of Chu to complete the performance assessments of all counties in the province, explore the people's livelihood, and use it as a reference for new policies.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] Chairman Shen is scheduled to go to Shanghai and then to Wenzhou on the 21st. This afternoon at 3:00, he convened a meeting with the principals and academic affairs directors of middle schools in Hangzhou. Director of Education Li also attended to review middle school education in Hangzhou. He said that the recovery is coming to an end, and the responsibility for spiritual construction is heavy. Only by knowing and understanding each other can we overcome this difficult time. However, Hangzhou schools lack material conditions, young people are docile, energy is insufficient, there is education without entertainment, and group power is too poor. Although there are many famous scholars in Zhejiang Province, the general cultural level is low, feudal concepts are strong, and morality and learning have declined, forming a failure of education. Therefore, Shen loudly called for promoting moral education and revitalizing the people's hearts, which must also start from this. He also made some statements on school management affairs.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] According to reports, only more than 200,000 shi of land grain has been collected in Zhejiang Province.

The Provincial Land Grain Office is stepping up collection and plans to adjust land tax, build Changping granaries, and increase grain production from next year.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] The funds for Zhejiang's water conservancy and transportation construction were previously discussed by Director Pi with the central government and have not arrived.

It is planned to allocate 700 tons to water conservancy, and the rest to transportation.

The previous requests from Linhai, Lanxi, Changshan and other counties to allow the popular election of county magistrates were also approved by the Provincial Council. However, this must be handled by the central government in conjunction with the case, so Chairman Shen said that it will not be done this year and may be discussed at length next year.

### Rushing to Repair the HaiNing Juezi Shiqing Causeway; The Brushwood Causeway Project Has Begun, and a New Concrete Causeway Will Be Built on the Original Site

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou News] The Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau recently decided to completely repair the seawall project in the next two years, and then carry out the fundamental project of the Qiantang River from 1948, striving to complete the great achievement within three years, so that the lower reaches of the Qiantang River can be fixed and there will be no more disasters of breaching the seawall. The HaiNing "Jue" Zi Hao's seawall was damaged. The Bureau decided to build a new concrete seawall of 30 meters on the original site. Before it is completed, a brushwood seawall will be built first to avoid negligence. The brushwood seawall project has begun. As for the equipment for building the new concrete seawall, the Executive Yuan's General Office is transporting it from Shanghai, and construction can also begin within days. After the completion of this seawall, a 150-meter water barrier will be added to prevent the river from approaching the seawall base and ensure safety. As for the collapse of the Xiaoshan Nanhe River, the Bureau has also formulated a rescue plan, and plans to stop the seawall first to prevent the tide from invading inland. However, as usual, it must be repaired by the local people themselves, and the Seawall Engineering Bureau can only assist from the side.

### Suzhou Cloth Factories Request Yarn Allocation

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou News] There are as many as 42 weaving factories of all sizes in Suzhou. The amount of cotton yarn required is quite large. However, in the past six months, due to the depletion of cotton yarn inventory, all the factories have had to purchase from the black market. The prices are high, and it is difficult to purchase, increasing the cost of military products and sluggish sales. Therefore, cloth prices are falling from time to time, and the factories are suffering huge losses, making it impossible to maintain. It is an unprecedented crisis for the Suzhou cloth factory industry. Wu Zhenshan, Chairman of the Cloth Factory Industry Association, recently heard that the weaving factory counterparts in Shanghai have obtained a universal allocation of cotton yarn. On the 18th, he first urgently telegraphed the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to consider the difficult and precarious situation of all Suzhou cloth factories, and quickly transfer the request to the Shanghai Textile Industry Management Committee, so that the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Industry Association would allocate it nearby, in accordance with the light examples of the Shanghai Changzhou and other cloth factory counterparts, in order to maintain production.

### 崑松展開冬防　澄錫武聯防在進行中

[From Our Jiangyin Correspondent] In recent days, bandit alarms have been frequent in various districts of the western countryside. The county government believes that if vigorous efforts are not made to suppress them, future troubles are to be feared. The best way to deal with this is to restore the joint defense organization of the three counties of Cheng, Xi, and Wu, and to select local people of prestige to preside over it in order to quell the banditry. It is proposed to appoint the former Ning County Magistrate Xu Bingquan as the director of the organization. The proposal has been submitted to the Capital Garrison Headquarters for approval. Furthermore, in order to prevent banditry, Commander Tang has ordered the rapid reorganization of the township and baojia organizations throughout the county, the execution of joint guarantee agreements, the establishment of road protection villages, the flexible and comprehensive deployment of communication and intelligence networks, and the strengthening of self-defense forces. This is to be implemented by the 30th of this month. Starting from December 1st, the Headquarters will send special commissioners to inspect various counties.

[From Our Kunshan Correspondent] In order to ensure the achievements of the suppression campaign and maintain public order, the county government of this district convened a winter defense meeting on the afternoon of the 18th, and resolved the following key issues: (1) Division of defense areas: The urban and rural areas will be divided into defense zones, which will be jointly responsible by the military police and security teams.

### 吳江倪慰農氏　倡用新式農具

### 公共汽車激動乘客咒詛

The Nanshi district after the war has been ravaged by artillery fire, making it quite pitiful, but at present, new houses are being built in several places, and the number of shops has also increased compared to before, so the market is gradually recovering. The municipal authorities, in order to facilitate the transportation of citizens, have public bus services, which are welcomed by the general salaried employees and working class people. However, it has recently been rumored that the buses always come in convoys of four or five vehicles, and they drive away quickly without opening the doors when they arrive at the station, leaving passengers who have been waiting for a long time unable to get on the bus.

One day last month, the writer had just finished a meeting at the General Labor Union and felt quite tired. When I walked to Xiaobeimen, I planned to take Route 6, but after waiting for about fifteen minutes, I did not see a bus coming. Just as I was becoming impatient, I saw three to five vehicles coming at the same time. When the bus arrived at the station, the first vehicle was already full of passengers, so the door did not open and it drove away. The passengers crowded in front of the door of the second vehicle. There were fewer passengers in the car than in the previous one. The driver and ticket seller were shouting, "There are empty vehicles in the back." Before they finished speaking, the car had already started. So the general passengers flocked to the vehicles in the back. The carriages were of course much emptier than the first two, but the ticket sellers shouted "Empty in the back!" in unison, and blew the whistle. The three vehicles chased away as if they were flying. The general passengers expressed disappointment and hatred and cursed; "Damn it! I can walk myself," "Run, run," and a few who were too impatient to wait cursed and ran away. The sky was gradually getting dark, and the writer was fortunate enough to be returning home in the evening, and had nothing to do. I decided to wait a little longer, and at the same time, I took the opportunity to look at the skilled small techniques of repairing tricycles by the roadside, which was a way to pass the time. Unknowingly, I waited another ten minutes. Four vehicles drove up in a row from a distance. The first and second vehicles were full of passengers, so they drove away without stopping. The third and fourth vehicles were relatively empty. The passengers rushed to the front of the car door before the vehicles stopped, but as before, the ticket sellers pointed to the back and shouted, "There are empty vehicles coming in the back." At this time, the writer could not help but sigh secretly, and then heard the passengers cursing incessantly; "Chinese people never do things well," This sentence made people feel "so sad!" Although the writer is just a small clerk, I sincerely hope that the people after the victory will not have such contempt for state-run enterprises! Therefore, I put forward the following points for Zhao, the director of the bureau, and the responsible personnel of the vehicle affairs department to pay attention to and improve. (1) Are the vehicles connected and arriving at the station at the same time, is it so the ticket sellers can evade the ticket checkers to not have time to take care of all of them? (2) Since there are empty spaces in the carriage, why not open the door to accommodate passengers when they arrive at the station. (3) Since Laoximen is the starting point, why does the person in charge of dispatching the vehicles not allocate them at intervals and cause several vehicles to depart at the same time? (4) In Shanghai, where Chinese and foreign transportation tools compete, it is necessary to improve the courtesy of drivers and ticket sellers to passengers. If there is no proper training, there will be no difference between them and those run by foreign merchants, then the loss of passengers switching to foreign merchant vehicles every day will accumulate over time, and it cannot be said that it is not a loss to the country. (5) It is best to assign several mobile inspectors to check whether the drivers and ticket sellers are performing their duties, and to provide convenience for passengers getting on and off the vehicles. (6) Any enterprise is prone to malpractice and dereliction of duty if there is no adequate compensation for life, so the treatment of service personnel should also be reasonable. Otherwise, even if the above points can be improved, it is only a temporary solution, because work efficiency depends on work mood, and the spirit of service is embodied in the interest of service (Zhang Zhi).

Looking back at the sudden outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, the Japanese invaders took the opportunity to land at the Jinshanwei estuary (November 5th of that year), and almost the entire southeast was lost to the enemy. Therefore, after painful reflection, it seems that the collapse of the Jinshanwei coastal defense should be the most painful lesson. According to the Jinshanwei City was built by Qi Jiguang during the Ming Dynasty to defend against the Japanese pirates. Unexpectedly, more than 300 years later, it was broken into by the Japanese invaders in one day. Therefore, in order to alert the people to pay attention to coastal defense and train the navy, in order to commemorate the major damage suffered in this war of resistance, and in order to mourn the lives and property sacrificed due to the sudden loss of Jinshanwei, it seems that there should be some expression. Either designate a road in a large city in our country and name it Jinshanwei Road (renaming a street in Shanghai is the most appropriate), or erect a monument near the place where the Japanese invaders first landed near Jinshanwei City to serve as a warning and a memorial, both of which are of profound significance.

Reply to Mr. Wang Hucheng: Regarding the letter you pointed out was delayed, the Shanghai Postal Administration replied: "It has been found that a surface mail sent from Yin County to Mr. Wang was indeed delayed. The reason is that there are currently a large number of mails received and sent by this bureau and the Yin County Bureau, and the processing is relatively slow. We have ordered the improvement and sent a letter to the Yin County Bureau to pay attention. However, the urgent mail was indeed delivered properly on the 13th of last month. Because Gongjun, who lived together, did not deliver it on the same day, it was left for one day. Mr. Wang has provided a written proof. Regarding the matter that letters are often misplaced by the doorman or co-resident after delivery, this bureau has repeatedly notified the public to pay attention." Specially delivered.

Gu Weijun Elaborates on Confucius' Philosophy to Earn Applause from the Audience

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly held its first vote of 54 countries today and unanimously passed the resolution proposed by Egypt, requesting all governments to "immediately stop religious and so-called racial persecution and discrimination." The only opponent was South African Prime Minister Smuts. During the General Assembly's discussion of the resolution, he stood alone, reading the newspaper indifferently, because India was about to present evidence of racial discrimination against South Africa.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss the draft resolution proposed by Egypt regarding racial and religious discrimination. Egyptian representative Awad said in his first speech that the draft resolution proposed by Egypt could be seen as "a symbol of good overcoming evil." The Polish representative expressed his straightforward endorsement of it, saying that Poland had suffered greatly from racial discrimination. Soviet representative Vyshinsky also strongly supported the resolution, but said that the resolution was too abstract and could not point out practical ways to oppose exclusion. At this point, Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun rose and said that the draft resolution proposed by the Egyptian representative was in complete agreement with the United Nations Charter, and the Chinese delegation fully supported it. Although this resolution does not have any specific provisions, there are still many countries that have failed to respect the concept of human equality. Therefore, the Chinese representative expresses unlimited welcome to the Egyptian resolution. As for China, it has respected human equality since 5,000 years ago. This principle is still implemented today. There are five different ethnic groups in China: Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan, and the religions they believe in are enough to represent all the religions in the world, but they can still live in peace with each other. This is because China can implement the principle of human equality. The first teacher Confucius of China said, "All men within the four seas are brothers." We are always mindful of Confucius's legacy and earnestly follow it, and we deeply hope that the General Assembly can unanimously pass the resolution proposed by Egypt. Soviet representative Vyshinsky expressed that although the Soviet Union would vote to support the resolution, he felt that the failure of the resolution to list factual country names and to suggest specific measures to prevent discrimination was a deficiency. U.S. representative Austin and British representative Shawcross also spoke in succession to support the resolution. Shawcross also expressed his support for Vyshinsky's point of view, pointing out that words and resolutions alone were not enough, so the United Kingdom would do its best to complete the Human Rights Commission in the General Assembly to stipulate a code of fundamental human rights. The Indian representative said that this draft resolution, because it is a major step in determining the complete equality between humans regardless of whether they are white, black, or yellow, deeply hopes that this draft resolution can be unanimously passed, and hopes that the representatives of various countries can study the situation in their own countries after returning home. And find ways to remedy any existing discrimination. Finally, French representative Baroudy said that the French delegation expressed its support for this resolution, but I would like to tell everyone that France has never allowed any racial discrimination, and such discrimination is completely inconsistent with the spirit of the French people.

### 安理會改選理事　哥敘比三國當選　社經會理事美黎重選蟬聯

[U.S. News Service, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly today elected Colombia, Syria, and Belgium as non-permanent members of the Security Council for a term of two years. The "General Assembly" also elected Venezuela and New Zealand as members of the Social and Economic Council for a term of three years, and the United States and Lebanon were re-elected to consecutive terms. There were still two seats vacant in the Economic and Social Council, but because the voting results were not enough by two-thirds, none of the four candidate countries (Turkey, Netherlands, Belarus, and Yugoslavia) were elected. General Assembly President Spaak then announced that it would be decided at the next plenary session. Due to today's election results, next year's eleven Security Council members will be: the five permanent members (U.S., U.K., China, Soviet Union, France) and Australia, Brazil, and Poland (the terms of the above three countries will expire at the end of 1947) and Colombia, Syria, and Belgium elected today. Next year's Economic and Social Council members will be: Cuba, Czechoslovakia, India, Norway, Soviet Union, United Kingdom (terms expire at the end of 1947), Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, France, (terms expire at the end of 1948) and the four countries elected today (United States, Venezuela, Lebanon, and New Zealand) and the two countries that have not yet been elected, all of which have terms expiring at the end of 1949.

India Fails to Be Elected

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th Dispatch] The three elected members of the Security Council were elected by secret ballot. It is reported that India has tried its best to win a seat on the Security Council to replace Egypt and has obtained the support of China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, but India only received thirteen votes, ranking fourth and failing to be elected. The election results show that the composition of the Security Council still maintains the previous regional distribution method. Colombia represents Latin America, Syria represents the Arab group, and Belgium represents Western European countries. Colombia succeeds Mexico, Syria succeeds Egypt, and Belgium succeeds the Netherlands. Before the actual election was held, there was still a lot of behind-the-scenes activity, and the result had been predetermined long ago. The election was just a routine procedure.

### 莫洛托夫主張　義南直接談判

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] Molotov informed Italy that the Soviet Union advocated direct negotiations between Italy and South Tyrol to resolve the problem of the port of Trieste and the border between Italy and South Tyrol. Molotov said in a letter to Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Garomi (now in New York as a member of the Italian delegation attending the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference) to convey the position of the Soviet Union. Molotov said that the Soviet Union supports the proposal put forward by Sintot to hold direct negotiations, and said that the Soviet government believes that direct negotiations between Italy and South Tyrol can solve this problem in a spirit of agreement and restore normal relations between Italy and South Tyrol.

### 沙地國利用美貸款　在波斯灣開闢商港　築三百哩鐵路與腹地聯絡

[Associated Press, London, 19th Dispatch] Radio Moscow broadcast from Mecca, the holy city of Islam, today, saying: Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Suliman announced a plan to use the credit loan recently borrowed from the United States to build a new port in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Suliman went to Washington in August of this year and negotiated with the Export-Import Bank to borrow US$10 million for the purchase of goods in the United States. The new port to be built will be connected to the inland city of Riyadh by a 300-mile-long railway, and its equipment will be purchased from the United States. It is planned to build power plants in Riyadh and Medina, which will also be equipped with American equipment.

### 聯大決定　休會日期

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The General Assembly's Steering or Guidance Committee held a meeting immediately after the General Assembly adjourned today and decided that December 11 will be the last adjournment date of the General Assembly, and December 5 will be the last date for committee meetings.

### 安理會昨開會討論　國外駐軍問題　五強即可筣會商討否決權

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco 20th Broadcast: The Security Council met this afternoon to discuss the most difficult issue, namely the number of troops of the allied countries stationed in non-enemy countries.

[Reuters, New York, 20th Dispatch] The five powers are expected to resume discussions today on the plan proposed by China, the the UK, and the US to limit the use of veto power. It is said that the five-power meeting was temporarily cancelled yesterday. The reason was not announced, but it is thought to be because the United Nations was holding a plenary session at the same time, and the foreign ministers could not spare the time. Bevin met with Byrnes yesterday morning, presumably to exchange views on the German issue and the Palestinian issue.

### British Policy on the German Question: Six Principles Decided

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] Sources here claim that the United Kingdom, United States, France, and the Soviet Union will soon hold a meeting in New York to discuss the German question. The UK's stance for advocacy at that time has been clearly defined. Foreign Secretary Bevin is said to have prepared a memorandum outlining the British arguments, essentially comprising the following six points: (1) The UK advocates that Germany should achieve political and economic unification under a system that is neither centrally controlled nor federal. (2) The UK believes that Germany's production capacity, as stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement, is insufficient. Therefore, Germany should be allowed to produce 11 million tons of steel annually, using the proceeds to purchase food. (3) Under the current reparations plan, the UK objects to any removal of equipment from Germany by either the Soviet Union or Western countries. Even if the Soviet Union proposes phased deductions, the UK cannot agree. Only when Germany's production increases sufficiently to cover the costs of Allied occupation and supplies will the UK be able to abandon this view. (4) The UK prefers the merger of the UK and US occupation zones to an agreement that would allow the Soviet Union to remove equipment from Germany as reparations during the period when Germany relies on UK assistance. (5) The UK remains willing to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the control of the Ruhr industrial area within a unified German structure. (6) The UK intends to propose the establishment of a central German administrative structure, including a central civil service corps, and the appointment of local government agencies with the authority to make political decisions, subject to the final approval of the occupying powers.

### US Drafts Disarmament Plan

[United Press, New York, 19th] US officials are currently drafting a disarmament proposal that is believed could lead the world towards disarmament and ensure the security of the United States. The proposal is expected to be formally submitted to the UN General Assembly at the end of this week or the beginning of next week. Authoritative sources say the draft will require the following points as the price for countries to participate: (1) Effective guarantees that no country will undermine the established goals of disarmament. (2) Assurance that other countries will implement disarmament to the same extent as the US and fully fulfill their commitments. This plan is the US response to Molotov's disarmament proposal in the UN. The plan will be submitted to President Truman for approval before it is announced.

### United Nations to Control Narcotics Work

Draft Passed by the General Assembly

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] At the General Assembly meeting today, China, the US, the UK, the Netherlands, and Abyssinia all urged the Assembly to quickly handle the draft agreement to transfer the League of Nations' work on combating narcotics to the UN. The Assembly unanimously passed the draft. Guo Taiqi stated that China has always supported international control of narcotics and that the Chinese delegation has been very active in the work of establishing a Narcotics Commission. Guo stated that the Chinese government would sign the draft as soon as possible. The Assembly also unanimously passed the draft today, but it will only take effect after being signed by more than 35 countries.

### Feng Yuxiang in America

### Preliminary Results of Romanian Elections: Communists Predominate, Minor Bloodshed Occurs in Various Locations; Romania Assures US of Free Elections

[Our Report] London, 20th Broadcast: Initial results from the Romanian parliamentary elections indicate that the Communist-controlled government group has a significant advantage, with opposition parties lagging far behind. Both sides accuse each other of violating election rules.

[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 19th] Officials announced tonight: The parliamentary elections were conducted in peace and order, with only a few isolated incidents of bloodshed incited by the opposition, but without consequence. Voting took place in the capital's central districts, especially in major factories. Romanian officers and soldiers voted in their barracks.

[United Press, Bucharest, 19th] Romania elected a new parliament today. The election results will not be announced before noon tomorrow. Troops were ordered to guard polling stations. The key to this election is whether the Communist government led by Groza can retain power. The Communist government advocates strengthening relations with the Soviet Union and establishing a communist social system. The opposition supports maintaining a middle-class capitalist system.

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The State Department announced that Romania has assured the US government that it will respect the democratic principles of freedom and justice in today's elections. Romanian Foreign Minister Tătărescu yesterday presented the US representative in Bucharest,  Berry, with a response to the US note. Tătărescu reiterated that the Romanian government believes the US proposal is an attempt to interfere in Romania's internal affairs, but at the same time guaranteed that the democratic principles of freedom and justice would continue to guide the general election.

### US Coal Miners' Strike: Significant Domestic and International Impact

[United Press, Pittsburgh, 19th] Although the Federal Court has ordered a ban on the anthracite coal mine strike, the number of strikers continues to increase. Yesterday, 38,000 miners were on strike, and today another 40,000 joined, totaling approximately 78,000. 272 coal mines have been closed, resulting in a daily reduction in coal production of 20 percent. Fuel supplies to steel mills are beginning to falter, and some mines in those plants are also on strike. Whether a nationwide coal mine strike will begin remains to be seen on the 21st. John L. Lewis, former president of the Mine Workers Union, has notified the government, stating that the union contract expires on that date. Lewis has made no statements since the strike ban was issued.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Department of the Army announced today that it is prepared to work with the Department of the Interior to intervene in the coal mine strike, but has not yet received a notification for the Army to be deployed.

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the impending US coal mine strike is a major blow to countries in need of US food and coal. If 400,000 anthracite coal miners across the country go on strike, the export of coal and food will inevitably cease.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of the Interior Krug predicted today that the coal mine strike would have a significant impact on all aspects of national life. According to him, within 60 days of the strike, 64 percent of electricity-powered public utilities, 60 percent of steel mills, 90 percent of coking plants, 86 percent of first-class railway companies, 90 percent of cement plants, and 70 percent of other factories would be shut down.

### Presentation of Material Evidence in Japanese War Crimes Trial: Likely to Exceed Scheduled End Date

[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] According to reliable sources today, the US prosecutor at the Far East Tribunal had hoped to conclude the presentation of material evidence related to the 27 Japanese war criminals by early December. However, due to the insistence of the British and Philippine prosecutors on presenting all documents related to Japanese atrocities, it is feared that this deadline cannot be met. Prosecutors from the eleven countries have recently held multiple meetings, placing considerable emphasis on the importance of the conspiracy charge in the indictment. The prosecution of the defendants for "planning, inciting, and conducting aggressive war" could have been effectively concluded after US Navy Admiral Lee Richardson presents a detailed report on the attack on Pearl Harbor next week. The US prosecutor believes that by briefly presenting specific examples of Japanese military atrocities, the entire case could be completed by the second week of December.

### Strength of Greek Rebels Grows Daily: Over 100 Villages in Northern Border Region Under Their Control; Greek Government Plans to Appeal to the UN General Assembly

[Our Correspondent in London, 20th] The importance of the war on the Greek-Yugoslav border is increasing daily, as Greece has announced that it will appeal to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting the UN to prevent certain countries from participating in the conflict on the Southern-Greek border. If this occurs, the UN General Assembly, which has yet to achieve much, will face new difficulties. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that the British government has received official notification from Greece proving that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia are participating in the Greek border conflict. The British government is currently considering this notification.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: Greek Army Chief of Staff General Spiliotopoulos flew to London by plane on Tuesday and will request increased British aid to deal with both internal and external troubles.

[Reuters, Athens, 19th] The strength of the rebels in the Western Macedonia region is increasing, and they have occupied over 100 villages. They also publish their own newspaper, establish their own courts, and their leaders are two elementary school teachers, with headquarters in the village of Melisssa. One of their "free zones" extends to the far west of Macedonia, only two or three miles from the city of Grevena, which can be defended by Greek government forces. Fierce fighting has taken place in the area around Mount Skra for many days, but there is now no trace of the rebels. Greek government planes and artillery were also deployed during the fighting.

Social Phenomena Under High-Pressure Living

### Japanese University Students Compete to Become Orchestra Performers

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 19th] Amidst the waves of post-war inflation, an increasing number of Japanese students are seeking jobs to pay tuition and maintain their livelihoods. Those with a skill do not have to worry about finding work. Currently, there are as many as seventeen dance hall bands in Tokyo composed of university students, each earning between 16,000 and 20,000 yen per month, which is envied by civil servants and teachers whose monthly salaries are less than 1,000 yen. According to Mr. Ohashi, a student in the music department of Keio University, the number of student-organized bands has gradually increased since April of this year. He works from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM at the Shirokiya dance hall and from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM at the Garden dance hall, earning over 20,000 yen per month at times. However, it is still difficult to decide whether to completely abandon studies and make this a profession, or to continue studying and make this a side job. Serious consideration of the future is a cause for concern, he said.

### Woman Appointed as Speaker of Parliament: A First in the UK

[Reuters, London, 19th] Labour MP Mrs. Paton was elected today as one of the twelve chairmen of this session of the House of Commons. The appointment of a woman as speaker of parliament is unprecedented in the UK. When the parliament holds standing committee meetings, Mrs. Paton will serve as chair. However, when the parliament discusses budget issues, the parliament will become a committee, and Mrs. Paton will be the chair of the entire House of Commons meeting. The chairman must be familiar with procedural law and know the names of all members of the House of Commons. Mrs. Paton's husband, Mr. Paton, is also a member of the House of Commons, and the two often sit together during meetings.

### China in British Eyes

— From Our Correspondent in England, Zhu Zunzhusends

Although news from China is unfavorable, the British press does not have a particularly bad view of China. The London Times publishes news from China every day, and every one or two months, it publishes an editorial on China issues. Every year on Double Ten Day, The Times publishes articles analyzing the Chinese situation. The Times is fair in its position and criticizes the illegal and reckless actions of the CCP. Other London newspapers rarely publish China news. When they do, most are tabloid or evening newspaper styles. For example, photos of what Chinese people eat, what they wear, and young women wearing cheongsams often appear in the gossip or snippets sections of various newspapers. The News Chronicle used to publish many articles about China because of Geld, who touted the CCP. However, he himself was not sympathetic to the CCP. In fact, it was because he had disagreements with several spokespersons when he was in Chongqing, which caused him to develop a strong aversion to the entire Chinese government. When his aversion reached its peak, he became a strong supporter of the CCP. The Chronicle has gradually corrected its views on China. Their political commentator, Mr. Bartley, will soon visit China. Mr. Bartley's world political vision has always been respected by the British. His views on the September 18th Incident are completely consistent with China's point of view. The Manchester Guardian, which has always been considered sympathetic to China by the Chinese people, publishes very little news about China. When there is an editorial, its tone does not appear "sympathetic."

British magazines have mixed influences on China. The Economist, the most prestigious weekly magazine, often has discussions about China, and bluntly pointed out that the civil war is the root cause of all evils in China's inflation. This time, the left-wing weekly "New Statesman and Nation" has views on China that are almost like "Xinhua" and "Liberation". Its position is well known. Just like the opinions of the Daily Worker (the organ of the British Communist Party) are not taken seriously, the most successful aspect of the CCP's external propaganda is their so-called "peasant movement," boasting about their rent reduction and other land reform policies in the border areas. Most British newspapers, including The Times, believe that the CCP has a solution to this urgent social problem.

British people generally do not care about the Hong Kong issue. Some people are very willing to hand this island back to China. Those who object are still the same "old China hands". What the British people in the UK do not understand the most is: why do the Chinese in Hong Kong have such deep antipathy towards the British? This suspicion is very natural, because the British in Britain do not know the lifestyle of the British in colonies, semi-colonies, and sub-colonies - the arrogance of imperialists. These imperialists swagger and domineer abroad, but when they return home, their attitude changes and they are the same as ordinary, humorous British people.

The British do not understand China enough. Our foreign propaganda authorities should pay attention to this. However, propaganda alone is not enough. To get a nation to understand us, introducing our cultural life is one way. However, the first thing to do is to clarify the current domestic situation. Everyone knows that China has a long history and a great culture, but if all the news revealed from this great cultural background is bad news, the big question mark in foreigners' hearts will never be eliminated. (End)

### Although the British "Party Rebellion" Has Subsided, the Political Situation is Still Not Optimistic. The Opposition Occupies a Strong One-Third of the Entire House. The Actual Internal Division of the Labour Party Remains the Same.

[United Press, London, 19th] Although the House of Commons voted 335 to zero last night to trust the government's current foreign policy, 160 Labour MPs did not vote. Excluding those who were sick or had other reasons, at least 100 Labour MPs expressed no opinion during the vote. The high proportion makes it difficult for the government to claim victory without feeling troubled. Of the members who participated in the vote, 230 were Labour, 104 were Conservative, 7 were Liberal, and 12 were from smaller parties. Supporters of the government claim that the vote of confidence is sufficient to show the world that British public opinion supports Foreign Minister Bevin. However, critics say that the large number of abstentions proves that the Labour Party's policies are actually as divided as ever, and have not been remedied by this. There is a possibility that the rebellion may happen again. The government cannot ignore this crisis and say that everything is calm and quiet. Rebellious members explained the reason for their abstention, because they cannot interpret this kind of vote as a general distrust of the government. For example, they fully agree with the government's domestic policies, and even have no objection to certain parts of foreign policy. Therefore, the government has obtained the trust of the majority in the House of Commons for only two reasons: (1) In terms of domestic affairs, the Labour Party seems to be as united as ever; (2) In terms of foreign affairs, the Conservative Party and loyal members of the Labour Party unanimously support the government.

### Beijing-Shanghai Facsimile Telegraph Open: Transmitting and Receiving Pictures and Photos Without Any Delay; Telegraph Fees are of Two Types: 50,000 Yuan and 20,000 Yuan

[Our Report] The Beijing-Shanghai facsimile telegraph was officially opened yesterday. The transmission of text, pictures, and photos is extremely clear. The facsimile telegraph machine at the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau was installed and tested long ago. The Nanjing side also completed testing yesterday. After the opening yesterday, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications sent a facsimile telegram to Mayor Wu, which read: "Mayor Wu Guozhen of Shanghai, Respectfully: The Ministry is exerting all efforts to improve the business of various transportation departments. Regarding the innovation of telecommunications, long-distance telephones have adopted ultra-shortwave wireless machines, telegraphs have used typing telegraph machines, and express telegrams have been launched. We strive to make communications rapid and accurate. Now, we are piloting facsimile telegrams in Beijing and Shanghai. Today is the beginning of the launch, and I respectfully extend my thoughts. I hope you will be aware of them. Your brother, Yu Dawei, November 20th."

Mayor Wu of Shanghai replied to Minister Yu: "Minister Yu Dawei of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, Respectfully: I have received your telegram. I am aware that since you took over the Ministry of Communications, you have worked diligently and devoted all efforts to improving the transportation business. Adopting new-style machines and piloting facsimile telegrams means that public and private affairs can be achieved in an instant, making the country one family and connecting east and west into one place. Promotion to various places can be expected soon. I am deeply gratified. I respectfully reply by telegram. Your brother, Wu Guozhen, respectfully secret."

The locations for sending and receiving facsimile telegrams in this city are at the General Business Office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, No. 70 Fuzhou Road. Before sending a telegram, you must first obtain specially made paper from that office, which is divided into two types, A and B. The fee for each type A paper is 50,000 yuan, and the fee for type B is 20,000 yuan.

### Visit and Experiment

[Our reporter Nanjing 20th] Beijing-Shanghai wireless facsimile has been successfully tested after months of efforts by telecommunications personnel in both places, and has been officially opened. This morning, the reporter visited the receiving station of the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau, and was personally given an experimental transmission by the director of the station, Lei Dahua, who explained about the Beijing-Shanghai facsimile. First, a form was sent from Shanghai to Beijing, and the lines and handwriting were very clear. A written document was also transmitted from Nanjing to Shanghai. A piece of paper 12 inches wide and 8 inches high can be transmitted in 8 minutes. According to the discussion: Currently, because some parts of the machine have not been installed, the transmission of photos may not be very clear, but the transmission of other facsimiles, no matter if they are written in steel pen or ink, or even blueprints, can be recognized word for word. If the situation is good, even No. 5 small font can be transmitted one by one, and experimental results were shown, with some having no major differences from ordinary printed matter

The facsimile machines currently used by the Beijing and Shanghai Telecommunications Bureaus were produced by the American Western Union Company in 1942. A total of four units were shipped to China, two of which are now in Nanjing and two in Shanghai. Soon, one will be shipped to Beiping. This type of machine is newer than the ones currently used in Yu-Kun, can send and receive at the same time, and has automatic equipment, which is not as troublesome as the former. The order period was very early, but due to the war, it was stored in India for a long time. It was only recently transported to Beijing via Chongqing. Due to repeated migrations, and because each unit weighs three tons, many were damaged during transport to Beijing and needed to be repaired. Therefore, this is the reason why the opening was delayed.

### Fire on Sheshan Waters at Midnight: Hai Tian Liner Almost Caused a Disaster; Negligence by the Escort Officer Caused the Burning of Straw on the Ship; Rescued by Tenders, the Ship Continued to Qinhuangdao Yesterday Morning

The Hai Tian, a large Liberty ship of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company operating on the Shanghai-Qinhuangdao line, caught fire at approximately 12:00 midnight on the 19th after weighing anchor and departing from Shanghai. After reaching the waters off Sheshan outside Wusongkou, a fire suddenly broke out. The customs patrol boat heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, and the fire was extinguished. The deck was slightly damaged. The ship sailed to Qinhuangdao in the early morning yesterday. Afterwards, according to the truth obtained by a reporter from the East China News Agency from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the company received a fire report from the Hai Tian via radio the night before and immediately sent staff to investigate. Regarding the cause of the fire, it was due to the negligence of the escort officer who accompanied the cargo of flammable straw, which caused the straw to burn. Fortunately, the crew and customs patrol boat officers worked hard to rescue and extinguish the fire. Only two escort officers were burned, and they were taken to Shanghai by the bureau's ambulance boat yesterday morning and sent to the hospital for treatment. Their lives are not in danger. It is also known that the Hai Tian is the bureau's largest Liberty ship, with a deadweight tonnage of over 10,000 tons. This time, it was sailing to Qinhuangdao to load coal for Shanghai.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Landing Craft Aground Near Wanxian: Cargo Damaged by Dampness, Crew and Passengers Safe; French Ship "Songdan" Has Not Yet Sailed Out

[Our Report] Landing craft of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are dispatched to Shanghai and Chongqing, because the landing craft have shallow drafts and high speeds, so they are suitable for traveling long rivers. It is reported that the landing craft "Hua" No. 210 loaded cargo from Chongqing on the 13th of this month and sailed downstream. At approximately 9:00 AM the next morning, it ran aground on a reef near Wanjiang Shibaozhai. The front cabin was breached, and the river water seeped in, damaging the cargo with dampness. Fortunately, the crew and passengers were safe. The ship sent an electric message for help. The Yichang Branch received the message and sent a barge to rescue. After receiving the report, the head office also sent the landing craft "Hua" No. 208 to tow and rescue. According to the report of the ship, the river water has gradually receded in recent days. Yesterday, the bow of ship No. 210 was only inches, and the stern only slightly more than two feet, from the water. Although the rice and other cargo were removed, the ship body struck the reef and still could not float. Therefore, there is no way to tow it away for the time being. Rescue is continuing.

The French ship "Songdan", which arrived in Shanghai for the first time after the war, arrived in port on the 29th of last month. It was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to France on the 14th of this month, but after a slight repair in Shanghai, it was rescheduled to weigh anchor on the 16th. Unexpectedly, the crew suddenly made demands, which prevented it from sailing out. As of the 18th, it had not yet been resolved. The company immediately wired the Paris headquarters for instructions. The reply has not yet been received, so the return date of the ship to France is still uncertain. In addition to French expatriates returning to France, some of the passengers are Hong Kong passengers who have been refunded their tickets and switched to other ships. The company's regular liner "Andre Lebon" departed from Marseille on the 15th of last month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.

### Party and Youth League Hold Banquet to Welcome Xinjiang National Congress Delegates

Fang Xikong, director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wu Shao-shu, director of the Youth League, held a banquet at the Military Friends Association yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM to welcome the Xinjiang National Congress delegates who had arrived in Shanghai a few days ago.

### Disputes over the Hardoon Estate: Nationality Issue to Become the Focus of Contention; Management Insists Hardoon was British; Twelve Iraqi Relatives Decide to Sue

[Special Report] Regarding the Hardoon estate, twelve Iraqi relatives have recently sent representatives to Shanghai to initiate litigation for a share of the inheritance. Details of this situation were reported in this newspaper on the 11th. According to the Hardoon Estate Management, although Hardoon was originally from Iraq, it is a well-known fact that he naturalized as a British citizen. The British Consulate in Shanghai at the time issued him a passport, which serves as strong evidence. However, the twelve relatives insist that Hardoon did not obtain British citizenship through legal procedures and can also provide evidence to that effect. Therefore, Hardoon's nationality will be the focal point of contention in the estate case between the two parties. The current consideration for the twelve individuals is the amount of the litigation target. Based on current valuations, the Hardoon estate is estimated to be worth over 50 billion legal tender. If this amount is used as the basis for the lawsuit, the litigation fees would amount to a staggering 650 million yuan. Most of the Hardoon estate consists of real estate, with over thirty properties, totaling over 400 mu of land, as well as the Cishu and Hardoon buildings. Currently, real estate income is not as high as it used to be, with the total monthly income from Hardoon's real estate being only over 40 million yuan. George Hardoon, Luo Youlan, and over ten others each receive just over 2 million yuan per month, leading many to believe that it is unwise for the twelve Iraqis to spend a large sum of litigation fees on a lawsuit with no certainty of success. However, the twelve Iraqis believe that their rights are at stake and must be fought for, and that they have sufficient legal basis, so they will file a lawsuit in court within days.

### Lai Lingnai, Suspected of Instigating the Zang Case, Prosecuted by the District Procuratorate

[Special Report] Lai Lingnai, a Spanish sailor suspected of instigating the death of Zang Da's son, has had his case investigated and closed by the District Procuratorate, and has been prosecuted according to law. The indictment is as follows: "On September 22nd of this year, at approximately 10:00 PM, Lai Lingnai took a rickshaw from the Seamen's Club to the Huadu Ballroom on Zhongzheng East Road, alighting and entering without paying the fare. The rickshaw puller Zang Da's son waited for ten minutes and saw him leave the ballroom, heading east, and went forward to demand the fare. Lai Lingnai ignored him. Zang Da's son stepped forward and grabbed his arm; the rickshaw pullers nearby also shouted for money. Lai Lingnai, seeing this, suspected he would be beaten. Coincidentally, an American sailor passed by and he called for help. Without asking the circumstances, the sailor punched Zang Da's son in the chest. Zang Da's son fell to the ground, his head injured, suffering a concussion and dying. Zang Da's death was due to the concussion caused by the injuries he sustained before his death, as verified by the prosecutor and forensic doctor, with a report attached. The defendant Lai Lingnai also admitted that the rickshaw puller Zang Da's son was punched to the ground by the American sailor due to a fare dispute; however, he denies instigating the act. However, according to the rickshaw pullers Ren Xiaozhu and Liao Yuanshou, who were present at the time, they both saw the defendant Lai Lingnai say a few words to the sailor before the sailor punched the rickshaw puller. However, they did not understand his words. Considering the circumstances, the defendant Lai Lingnai is suspected of instigating others to injure someone, resulting in death, violating Article 277, Paragraph 2, and Article 219 of the Criminal Law. He is hereby prosecuted under Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Prosecutor Ji Su."

[Special Report] Regarding the issue of the return of American plasma, a reasonable solution was reached yesterday afternoon after Mayor Wu convened relevant parties for consultation. The meeting began at 2:30 PM, with representatives from the US Materials Clearance Committee, Lida International Trading Company, the US Consulate, and the US Navy in attendance. The consultation proceeded in a harmonious atmosphere. The Mayor guaranteed that all plasma stocks would be returned.

Both parties immediately agreed to this principle. As for what kind of goods to exchange, it will be determined by the US side and then consulted with our side.

After the agreement was reached, Mayor Wu held a press conference, reading the English statement issued by President Song of the Executive Yuan regarding this matter, which stated: "Regarding the discovery of plasma in a large batch of drugs sold by the US Materials Clearance Committee to a Chinese trading company, the Chinese government had no prior knowledge of this matter before the news was disclosed in the newspapers. Chinese merchants purchased it completely legally; however, the government cannot allow plasma donated by the American people to the Red Cross to be sold. Yesterday, I instructed Mayor Wu to seal the plasma inventory and to enable the US Clearance Committee and the purchasing trading company to reach an agreement so that it could be resolved reasonably according to ordinary procedures. I am now pleased that the parties concerned have reached an agreement and the buyer has agreed to return the blood to the US Consulate through the Municipal Government today.

### Fifteen Film and Drama Professionals to be Interrogated by High Court Today; Two Questionable Films Reviewed Yesterday; Written Opinions Submitted on the Spot; Authorities Hope Those Reported Will Respect the Judiciary and Report When Summoned

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Procuratorate of the High Court of this city is scheduled to continue its investigation into film and drama professionals suspected of collaborating with the enemy at 9:00 AM this morning. This second group summoned includes Li Huan, Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, Mei Xi, Liu Zhonghao, Zhang Shichuan, Xu Xinfu, Zhou Shimu, Bian Ying, Shi Tingpan, Hu Jinkang, Jin Longzhang, Zhang Xiaohai, Zhong Baoxuan, and Wu Zhongshan, fifteen people in total. However, because some summonses have not been delivered, it is feared that many will be unable to appear in court at that time.

[Report from Our Newspaper] During the period of the city's occupation, many people in the film and drama industry remained in Shanghai to work. After the victory, discussions about the issue of reporting film personnel who collaborated with the enemy were very heated, but no results were seen. Until recently, a certain organization suddenly presented a list of dozens of people to the Procuratorate of the High Court, reporting them, and the procuratorate is now summoning and investigating them in batches. This move has made film personnel who stayed in Shanghai in the past feel uneasy all day long. The impact has been so great that the budding film industry is almost at a standstill. In order to clarify right and wrong, and to avoid wrongly accusing anyone, the City Party Department, in conjunction with relevant organizations and groups, held a screening of the two questionable films "The Regret of Spring River" and "Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame" at the Huguang Theater yesterday morning for review. Present were Fang Zhi, Xie Renzhao, Sun Dongcheng, and Xu Mingya from the City Party Department; Wang Guanqing from the Municipal Government; Luo Xuelian from the Central Propaganda Department; Li Ximou and Peng Zhenqiu from the Education Bureau; Chen Shenxiu and Xia Jingtao from the Social Affairs Bureau; Du Tongsun and Jiang Bin from the Film Censorship Office; Wu Huasheng from the Youth Corps; Liu Deming from the Military Friends Society; Zhu Renyi from Zhongdian; Liang Gengshun and Yang Shounian from the District Procuratorate; Zhang Che from the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee; and reporters from various newspapers, totaling thirty to forty people. Qu Rong, the prosecutor in charge of the High Court's investigation of film and drama personnel who collaborated with the enemy, also attended with a clerk. "The Regret of Spring River" was shown first at 9:00 AM, followed by a ten-minute break, and then "Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame" was screened. It was already 1:30 PM when it was finished. All participants in the review received an opinion form. After gathering opinions on the two films anonymously, they were sealed on the spot and sent to the High Court Procuratorate as reference for the investigation.

Thoughts After Viewing

City Party Department Chairman Fang said after watching: "Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame" was filmed before "The Regret of Spring River." As a historical film, it was remarkable that it could say "Chinese people will not be slaves to a fallen nation" under Japanese military rule at the time. The Japanese were probably not satisfied with "Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame," which led to "The Regret of Spring River." And there were Japanese people involved. What is noteworthy in the film is that when the subtitles appeared, the Japanese were always first, and the Chinese were last. And the drama subtly emerged from creation. As far as I know, the Japanese Sonno Joi movement had no connection with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." City Party Department Secretary-General Xie Renzhao also said: "'Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame' narrates Lin Zexu's suppression of opium and resistance to the British. At that time, British imperialism did act in this way, and there were indeed organizations such as the Pingying Tuan in various places. Therefore, this film should be viewed in two points: firstly, in terms of narrating history, there is nothing wrong with it. Secondly, in terms of international relations, since Britain is now an ally, it seems to be problematic. Regarding the conclusion in 'The Regret of Spring River' that the Japanese sympathized with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, there seems to be no such record in history. The Japanese emphasized it in order to make the Chinese people feel good about them."

Before the participants in the film viewing filled out their review opinions, Chairman Fang said: "I hope everyone will criticize from an objective standpoint, and I hope that those who have been reported will report to the court according to the summons, and respect the judiciary in everything."

### Jiang Shangpei and Others Declared Not Guilty; Xie Guangming Sentenced to Two and a Half Years

[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court announced verdicts yesterday in two cases of suspected traitors: (1) Jiang Shangpei, Director of the Judicial Section of the New City Police Bureau of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, Deputy Detective Xie Guangming, Li Yongde, and Detective Chief Xu Shu were accused of illegally detaining people and infringing on their personal freedom by taking advantage of their power. Jiang, now the Director of the Judicial Section of the Laozha District Bureau in this city, denied illegally detaining merchants during the trial, and stated that the reason he continued to serve in the puppet police bureau was to participate in intelligence work for the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, which was testified by Yang Wenguang of the Fourth Detachment of the Shanghai Branch. He also participated in the anti-enemy police affairs led by Gan Jingxian, which can be proven by letters from Wu Tiecheng and Yu Hongjun to Qian Dajun. When Wei Zhongda, who is now employed by the Garrison Headquarters, was victimized that year, Jiang rescued him from danger and provided travel expenses, which was also testified by Feng. Yesterday, Jiang, Li, and Xu were all declared not guilty. Xie Guangming was sentenced to two years and six months.

Wang Zhenchuan Sentenced to Imprisonment

### Gas, Ferry, and Small Train Fares to be Adjusted Soon; Zhao Zengjue Reported at the Municipal Council Yesterday

Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported to the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon on the process of adjusting public utility prices. He stated that the Public Utilities Bureau believes that public utility companies should be given reasonable profits and that the reliability of their profits should be protected, otherwise no one will be willing to invest in public utilities. This adjustment will not be made for those that can be maintained, such as the Shanghai Telephone Company, which charges based on the number of calls. The current increase in the number of calls has exceeded expectations, and the revenue has increased, so it is not at a loss. Therefore, no adjustment was made at all. Those that cannot be maintained will be reasonably adjusted based on their income and expenditure. So far, those that have been approved include electricity, tap water, trams, and buses. Those that are being considered include gas and ferries. The small trains on the Jidu, Shangnan, and Shangchuan lines will be announced soon. The bureau's approval of the prices of various companies this time is to provide reasonable profits on the one hand, and to urge them to increase capital and expand equipment on the other hand, in order to meet the needs of the public, such as ordering various power companies to add generators, ordering British and French tram companies to increase vehicles, and handling the track connection from Jing'an Temple to Xujiahui Road. This week, the preparatory office of the Public Transportation Company was also ordered to increase the number of buses and pay road maintenance fees and license fees in the same way as other companies. In short, on the one hand, reasonable remuneration is given, and on the other hand, they are ordered to improve service efficiency.

Public Utilities Committee Meeting

[Another Report] The Public Utilities Committee discussed the following proposals yesterday: (1) A proposal to amend the method of collecting municipal construction donations by electrical companies was resolved: In principle, it was passed based on the standard of low prices and sent to the Finance Committee for review.

If they are deemed unqualified, their use or sale may be suspended." Temporary motion: In cases where new houses have not been issued building permits, how should the installation of electric lights be remedied? It was resolved: If new houses have not obtained building permits from the Public Works Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau should consult with the Public Works Bureau for handling.

### Clearing Accumulated Coffins in the City; Health Bureau Sets Deadline for Transfer Out of the City by Next Spring; Overdue Coffins Will Be Concentrated for Cremation by District

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to improve the environmental hygiene of this city, the Health Bureau has decided to thoroughly clear the accumulated coffins in funeral homes, temporary coffin storage places, and open spaces in various districts of the city. The original deadline for the coffins of owners to be transferred out of the city was the end of the year, but it has now been extended to the end of March next year, so that the owners can have sufficient time. After the deadline, all coffins stored in Shanghai will be treated as ownerless and will be concentrated for cremation by district.

It is understood that more than 97,000 accumulated coffins in the city have been registered with the Health Bureau, and there are also many unregistered or exposed in barren land. The total number is estimated to be more than 100,000. A part of the ownerless ones are mostly broken and decayed, and the foul smell is overflowing. Therefore, the district offices in various districts have repeatedly requested the transfer of these broken coffins. Now the Health Bureau has decided to handle the accumulated coffins in the city in a unified manner and adopt the most thorough method of cremation, with a deadline for implementation. In the future, the establishment of temporary coffin storage places will also be banned. Funeral homes will be allowed to store coffins for a maximum of ten days. On the one hand, the government will establish a coffin transportation office to assist families in transporting coffins out of the urban area.

Since the decision on this method, many coffin owners have complained that it is difficult to relocate and bury the coffins due to lack of land and money, and have called on the authorities to open more public cemeteries for burial. However, according to the Health Bureau, it is determined to clear the accumulated coffins and cannot allow the difficulties of a few people to affect the environmental hygiene of the majority. As for opening more public cemeteries, it is not in line with the principle of promoting cremation and reducing public cemeteries in the new urban plan. Moreover, public cemeteries require land. If each acre can bury 100 coffins, then 100,000 coffins require 1,000 acres. Moreover, there is an average of about 6,000 deaths per month. Not to mention that the municipal government lacks huge funds to purchase land, the value of land use is also extremely uneconomical. At the same time, it is better for coffins with owners to pay a fee to transport them to the countryside for burial once and for all than to store them in public cemeteries and pay storage fees. Therefore, the Health Bureau hopes that the owners can comply with the deadline for relocation.

### Abundant Inventory and Tight Credit; US Goods Expected to Fall, Not Rise; Generally Believed that the Trend of Smuggling is Difficult to Eradicate

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the import permit system, the market price of US goods in this city has not fluctuated, and there has been no phenomenon of customers crowding into US goods markets. People in the industry told reporters that the inventory of US goods in this city is very large, and the credit is very tight, so the price of goods will only fall, not rise. Business people believe that the implementation of the import permit system will not raise the market price of US goods in the short term, but if it is implemented effectively, it will have an impact in the long term. But whether this is the case depends on whether smuggling can be cracked down on. Most people do not believe that smuggling can be completely eradicated, because smugglers have extremely strong backgrounds and strength, and the methods of smuggling are also extremely varied. Under the current new method of control, smuggling may even become more rampant. Under the influence of this kind of psychology in the market, the market price of US goods will not fluctuate.

### Cracking Down on Underground Money Shops; Rewarding Citizens for Reporting

The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, ordering the strict crackdown on underground money shops in Taishi, and rewarding citizens for reporting them. The original order said: "Since prices have risen sharply and market interest rates have increased with commercial profits, so-called 'underground money shops' have emerged, illegally engaging in banking business and lending at usurious rates, exploiting and profiting, disrupting finance, and fueling speculation. Although they have been repeatedly seized and ordered to stop operating and fined in accordance with the penalties for privately established banks and shops stipulated in the Ministry's Measures for the Management of Banks, these money shops are mostly temporary combinations, attached to residences or shops. It is not easy to seize them. Even if they are discovered, they can still be relocated and operated as before after being punished. Obviously, their actions have violated criminal law and should be severely punished according to law in order to prohibit them.

Article 344 of Chapter 33 of the Criminal Law on Fraud, Breach of Trust, and Usury stipulates: "Whoever takes advantage of another's urgency, rashness, or inexperience to lend money or other items and obtains a usurious interest that is clearly disproportionate to the principal shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year, detention, or a concurrent fine of not more than one thousand yuan." Article 345 stipulates, "Whoever makes a profession of committing the crime in the preceding article shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than five years and may be concurrently fined not more than three thousand yuan." Underground money shops are able to run rampant because they take advantage of people's urgency, rashness, and inexperience to carry out their usurious lending and illegal profit-seeking schemes. In the future, whenever such cases are discovered, the details of the unauthorized establishment of banks and shops should still be reported to the Ministry for punishment in accordance with the Measures for the Management of Banks. The parts that violate criminal law should also be sent directly to the competent court with the criminals' credentials for investigation and handling in accordance with the law in order to punish and warn. Please immediately instruct your subordinates to strictly investigate these underground money shops and reward those who report them in order to stop them, and you should also make a detailed announcement to all industries and businesses that if they need to raise funds, they should go to legally established banks and money shops and handle them according to the correct procedures, or apply for small industrial loans from local financial institutions (provincial and municipal bank branches) in accordance with the regulations, so as to avoid being exploited by illegal lenders with usurious interest."

### Principals and Professors Serve as Councilors

Council Again Requests Interpretation from the Judicial Yuan

Regarding the issue that principals of public schools at all levels may not concurrently serve as councilors of provincial, county, and municipal councils, the Ministry of Interior Affairs replied by telegram, "The Judicial Yuan has already issued an interpretation on the case, and this Ministry has no right to correct it." Details have been recorded in various newspapers. Citizens throughout the city are paying close attention, especially councilors who are in a situation where they cannot hold both positions and are studying the issue of choosing between them. Candidate councilors also hope to be announced as soon as possible so that they can fill the vacancies. However, reporters specifically visited the council authorities yesterday. It is said that the council is already preparing to ask the Ministry of Interior Affairs to submit the matter to the Judicial Yuan for further interpretation, for four reasons: (1) No democratic countries have regulations that principals and professors may not serve as councilors. Since China is a democratic country, it should allow them to compete in elections. (2) In this country, councilors and representatives of the National Assembly are also allowed to participate in the National Assembly without any prohibitions. Councilors have the same nature as councilors and representatives of the National Assembly, and there should be no regulations prohibiting them from holding both positions. (3) Although principals of public schools are appointed, there is no clear distinction between simple recommendation and committee levels, so they cannot be equated with civil servants in general. (4) In today's world, where the whole country advocates education to build the country and respects teachers and values education, it cannot be considered wrong to have educators represent the people.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: The article published in your newspaper on the 18th of this month regarding the beating of Wenzhou workers at the Rihui Port Wharf is inconsistent with the facts. On that day, the dispute was originally caused by Wenzhou worker Jiang Xueqin leading a crowd to destroy the fifth and sixth branches of the association, beating and injuring staff members Zhang Xingkun and Xu Zhengyang, as well as the family members of the executive director of the association, and destroying all public property and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Zhang Xingkun is still in Guangci Hospital. Therefore, in addition to the Social Affairs Bureau handling the matter, the association has already filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. We are sincerely afraid that the rumors are inaccurate, so please investigate and correct them. Shanghai Nanshi District Wharf Transportation Industry Trade Union

### Social Services; Speaking Out for the Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick; May Enthusiastic Benefactors Actively Contribute

### Importers' Registration Notice: Chen Changtong Explains in Detail to Various Banks

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Changtong, the Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Committee, held a meeting yesterday at 1:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Bank of China, gathering responsible personnel from designated banks, both Chinese and foreign. Mr. Chen provided detailed explanations regarding the revised measures, implementing regulations, and the various application forms that had been issued. He also answered questions raised by the banks. The meeting concluded at approximately 4:00 PM.

Most designated banks received the Import Registration Application Instructions and the four types of application forms issued by the committee yesterday morning. However, due to printing constraints, the number of copies distributed was insufficient. Some banks have printed additional copies in accordance with the format, and will begin accepting applications once the printing is complete.

The Import Registration Application Instructions contain four items: (1) Importers should pay attention to Article 2 of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade: "Importers must register with the Provisional Import Control Committee according to the category of business they engage in. The registration method will be separately determined by the Provisional Import Control Committee. The applicant for import licenses shall be limited to registered importers." (2) In accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, this committee has announced the following: "Any merchant with a fixed business address, who was already operating before December 8, 1941, or who started operating after the above date and is currently a recognized agent of foreign export manufacturers, or who can provide records within one year proving their ability to engage in import trade, may apply for registration." (3) Importers who wish to apply for registration in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade shall complete Form AR-1 from today within two weeks. "If importing goods listed in Schedule (II), Form AR-1 (A) must also be completed." Submit to the Secretariat of this Committee. (4) The deadline for import merchants in ports other than Shanghai to apply for registration may be appropriately extended.

Four Types of Application Forms

As for the four types of application forms: 1. Import Merchant Registration Application Form, Form AR-1. 2. Past Import Commodity Classification List (limited to goods in Schedule (II)), Form AR-1 (A). 3. Import License Application Form for Goods Ordered Before November 17, 1946, specifically for applying for goods in Schedule (I), Form AL-P2 (I). This application must be jointly approved by the Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Committee and the Director of the Import Management Office. 4. Import License Application Form for Goods Ordered Before November 17, 1946, for applying for all goods other than those in Schedule (I), Form AL-P2 (II). This application must be approved by the Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank.

### ### Tight Trading Range, US Dollar Continues to Fall

The Shanghai currency market (烚赤) was extremely stable yesterday, with a very tight trading range. The opening price was 2.498 million, and it rose to 2.505 million at one point. Supply and demand were light, and buyers felt a bit cold, causing a slight decline. The low price fell to 2.485 million, and the Central Bank immediately allocated 60 million at a price of 2.485 million. After 10:00 AM, it became more stable. At noon, it struggled around 2.49 million. The afternoon sentiment was slightly better. It was reported that the Hong Kong currency (申鈔) had fallen in Hong Kong, and the next-day delivery rose to over 2.5 million. As a result, it rose by 10,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments gold was 66,000, silver dollar was flat, the underground lending market (暗拆) was still stable, and the interest rate was from 12 to 15%.

Foreign currencies were even more relaxed and abundant yesterday, and buying interest was not easy to stimulate. The US dollar's unofficial market (暗市) started at 4,550 yuan and then fell again. At noon, it fell to between 4,420 yuan and 4,470 yuan, down 100 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong currency had less supply than demand, and telegraphic transfers were sluggish. As a result, it fell another 10 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell from 915 yuan to 905 yuan with supply. The Indian exchange rate was 1,100 yuan. The British exchange rate fell from 14,800 yuan to 14,600 yuan. Only Hong Kong exchange had some transactions, and the rest were silent. The US exchange rate remained stagnant.

### ### Requiring 50,000 Pieces, Allocation Reduced by 60%: Cotton Yarn Supply and Demand Issues, Other Ports and Three Associations Request Assistance in Fair Allocation

Since the distribution of yarn for the replica product industry, the yarn distribution under the supervision of the Spinning Management Committee has recently included the camel wool weaving, canvas weaving, and ribbon weaving industries. The three industry associations requested the Spinning Management Committee to uniformly allocate yarn, and it is expected to be approved. Furthermore, they will join the Replica Distribution Association to handle the same. These three industries have about 300 member factories, mostly small and medium-sized enterprises, and the amount of yarn needed is still limited. As for dyeing, knitting, underwear, towel, blanket, handmade cotton weaving, and handkerchief industries, the supplementary reporting of yarn distribution for member factories has been compiled and reported. The Spinning Management Committee will hold a meeting today to consider it. According to news from the Replica Distribution Association, the total amount applied for in November was originally 40,013 pieces. After the Spinning Management Committee decided to temporarily allocate yarn at a 60% discount, a total of 24,000 pieces were allocated. These are distributed in four installments. Tomorrow is the fourth installment. The quantity was originally insufficient. In addition, too much of the 10-count coarse yarn allocated in the past installments was unsuitable, and a few factories could not afford to pay in time and gave up. The Replica Distribution Association did not transfer the yarn to the households with shortages, resulting in a shortage of fine yarn for most. As a result, a small amount of fine yarn was still returned. The general factories felt that the amount was increasingly insufficient, and those who relied on the stock of yarn to make up for it became increasingly scarce. If there is no remedy for the supply of yarn, the reduction in production in the replica industry is inevitable. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Replica Distribution Association, had already advised the industry not to add more machines and not to rush to restore the old factories that had been shut down. He also stated that although there was an allocation of cotton yarn, there was no way to supply the additional and restored machines. Recently, various replica industries have been investigating their member factories in batches to strictly crack down on false reports. According to the recent statistics reported to the Spinning Management Committee, the six replica industries have a total of 1,889 member factories, with 66,722 various looms, requiring a total of 42,316 pieces of various count cotton yarn, equivalent to 51,526 pieces of 20-count standard yarn. If calculated at 60% discount, it would be more than 30,000 pieces per month. On the yarn mill side, this is considered too much, while on the replica factory side, it is still insufficient. How should we coordinate and adjust this? All relevant parties expressed anxiety. In addition, the cotton yarn replica industries in the interior have also requested allocation. It is heard that the Spinning Management Committee has paid close attention to it. According to news from relevant parties, since the reorganization of the yarn allocation mechanism, the output of 10-count yarn from yarn mills has increased considerably, while the replica industry in this city does not need it. The cost of 10-count yarn is lower, and the profit is thicker. However, it is a pity that equipment that can spin 20-count yarn is reduced to spin 10-count yarn.

### ### Southern Transport of Yarn and Cloth: Review Comes to an End

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Spinning Management Committee's review of the amount of yarn and cloth that various manufacturers applied to transport to the south came to an end yesterday. Among them, 23 companies were requested by the committee to revise their applications because the amount applied for exceeded the limit. The rest have been issued transport permits one after another. In addition, the committee has decided to accept applications starting today for yarn mills that used to operate as distributors and have applied for the qualifications of distributors.

### ### Unified Bonds Fall Back

Public bonds were flat again yesterday. A major player sold off on the fifth floor. The Unified Bond C opened at 1,450 yuan in the morning and gradually declined from 1,540 yuan, finally falling below 1,400 yuan to end the day. As a result, it fell 90 yuan from the previous close. A, B, and E each fell 80 yuan, and Unified Bond D fell 100 yuan. The trading volume was more than 4 million yuan.

### ### Securities Industry Recession

Since the opening of deferred trading in the stock market in this city, it has remained in a recession due to the extremely tight credit and the heavy pressure of high-interest loans. Xietai, broker No. 51 of the Securities Exchange at No. 180 Nanjing Road, voluntarily suspended business yesterday morning. Several other companies are also about to run aground.

### ### Foreign Currency Not Allowed for Exchange Settlement: Central Bank Reaffirms Previous Prohibition

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the revision of the import and export trade measures, the Central Bank issued Circular No. 61, notifying designated foreign exchange banks to slightly revise the original regulations and abolish the provisions of Circulars No. 1, 26, 42, 45, and 54 (except paragraph 6). Among them, Circular No. 45 stipulates that foreign currency should not be used to offset foreign debt. Now that the circular has been abolished, whether foreign currency can be used to offset foreign exchange in the future has attracted attention from all parties. It is now learned that the Central Bank has reissued Circular No. 62 stating that after the cancellation of Circular No. 45, designated banks are still not allowed to accept foreign currency to offset foreign exchange for non-import purposes that have not been approved by the Central Bank in advance.

### ### Oil, Rice, and Grains All Show Weakness

Yesterday, the north and south rice markets continued to arrive. Registered cargo amounted to 16,000 piculs (石), with lackluster retail sales. Southern japonica rice flooded the market, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Northern japonica rice of medium and lower grades also fell by 300-500 yuan. Indica rice remained stable due to firm production prices. White yuan fell by 1,000 yuan, while silver yuan increased several times. Flour mills continued to supply, but sentiment was weak, and miscellaneous brands fell by another 100-200 yuan. Wheat remained flat. Soybean arrivals increased today, and retail sales in this street were still good, with high prices but stagnant transactions. Sesame was scarce and stable. There were no large-scale purchases of raw peanuts from both the South Seas and this street, and there were few transactions. The market fell again by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Soybean cake from Fujian and Shantou had weak purchases, falling by 100-200 yuan. The oil market traded as usual today. Soybean oil sales were strong, falling by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Raw oil was stable.

### ### Hankou Gang and Others Sell Off in Large Quantities: Soybean Oil Even Falls Below Negotiated Price

[Report from Our Newspaper] The new negotiated price for cooking oil was implemented yesterday. However, oil prices continued to fall because the Hankou Gang sold off 1,000-2,000 loads of soybean oil, and merchants also frequently sold off, so the market price fell below the limit of the new negotiated price. The average price of cooking oil in each store was 1,000-2,000 yuan lower than the negotiated price. Soybean oil was 131,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil was 127,000 yuan.

Yesterday, various private factories continued to allocate 500 loads of oil, including 100 loads from Dachangxin, 160 loads from Dayouyu, 65 loads from Changde, and 15 loads from Weimin. All of the above were soybean oil. Dasheng allocated 20 loads and Dadeshin allocated 80 loads, all of which were rapeseed oil. The Shanghai Food Oil Joint Allocation Office distributed the oil to 142 retail stores in the Hongkou district. Payment for this allocation is due today, and delivery will be made tomorrow.

In addition, after various oil presses in this city obtained soybeans supplied by the Central Trust Bureau, the raw material problem can be solved. Today, Xie Yuxiang and Zhang Chao from the oil industry will negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau on purchase procedures.

### ### Dispute over Opening Yarn Market

Cloth Factories Find It Difficult to Obtain Yarn and Are Willing to Exchange Cloth for Yarn

[Report from Our Newspaper] There were still few transactions in the yarn market yesterday. Initially, Yong'an Yarn Factory planned to sell 100 pieces of 20-count Jincheng yarn at the official price, and Shenxin Yarn Factory also planned to sell 100 pieces of yarn, limited to old customers who had previously traded. However, people in the industry raised objections, believing that this was not an impartial way, and there was a dispute. The two factories therefore did not open up sales temporarily. Because there is less gruel and more monks, it is not enough to distribute. Outside the market, transactions were restricted by the Bureau regulations, and there was no trading. It was difficult for general customers to handle goods urgently, and there was a situation where money was prepared but goods could not be bought.

The cloth market is currently stable after Mayor Wu instructed cloth industry representatives to pay attention to solidarity. However, because the inventory is too small, once customers search and purchase, the price will rise. General weaving factories find it extremely difficult to obtain yarn and are unwilling to sell in the market, preferring to exchange yarn for cloth, so that raw materials will not be scarce. This kind of barter method is really out of necessity. Colored cloth is also in short supply of dyes, and prices are expensive. Therefore, No. 190 Shilin also rose by 4,000-5,000 yuan yesterday. Longtou fine cloth is currently priced at 92,000 yuan, blue chicken fine cloth is priced at 90,000 yuan, and four gentlemen white printed drills are currently priced at 98,000 yuan. Shilin cloth is priced at 145,000-146,000 yuan.

### ### Mostly Closing Transactions: Chinese Stocks Show No Improvement

Chinese stocks were the last day for deferred delivery yesterday, and sentiment was even more anxious. Both supply and demand were mostly closing transactions. The market was extremely erratic, initially high and then low. The opening prices of various stocks in the morning showed low prices first. After No. 229 and No. 151 bought in, the buying intention on the surface was strong, and the chips were strangely scarce. It gradually rose. After 10:45, it started to turn from strong to flat. Outside the market, supply gradually became abundant. Nos. 8, 9, 4 and 151 were selling. Even if No. 111 tried hard to buy Dier Yong yarn, it could not support it. However, around 11:30, Nos. 87 and 198 came in. After No. 229 released and then re-entered Dier Yong yarn, it was easy to pull it up after the low price. However, the surface and the floating shorts competed to sell, and the American Asian (美亞) fell sharply. At noon, it retreated to a new low price.

### ### White Coal Stops Falling and Turns Stable

The white coal market, screened lumps, slightly increased its inflow on the low side, and the market gradually became stable. Bituminous coal, due to the imminent payment period for small peers to distribute goods, those who could not afford to purchase could only sell at a lower price, and the market price once softened. Now, because the payment period has arrived, the outflow of this batch of coal is scarce, and the market price has returned to firmness. Since the shortage of Hongji chip coal for coal balls, the allocation of goods from various factories has been reduced, and the supply has become insufficient. All coal shops are struggling to cope. The door-to-door price of normal burning coal balls has risen to 10,000 yuan per load.

### ### Central Yarn White Sugar Falls

Yesterday, the sugar market saw an increase in the spot availability of Zhongsha white sugar, and there was no shortage. Therefore, the price fell.

### ### American Cotton Reverses and Falls

[United Press, New York, 19th] The cotton market reversed today, with closing prices down 75 cents to 2.15 dollars per bale, due to fears of a coal miners' strike and the authorities' preparation to tighten supervision of commercial transactions, causing panic and a rush to sell.

### ### Southeast Asian Market: British and Americans Have Already Taken the Lead: National Goods Are Too Expensive and Transportation Is Difficult

[Report from Our Newspaper] Relevant people told reporters: Currently, trade between China and Southeast Asia is very sluggish. In the past, when foreign goods had not arrived in the Southeast Asian region, there was an urgent need and the standards for goods were not high. Therefore, a considerable amount of Chinese yarn and some daily necessities were transported to the south. But today, the situation is completely different. British and American goods have been transported to Southeast Asia in large quantities, and China's own yarn supply is insufficient; the cost of goods is high, and even if they are transported to Southeast Asia, it is difficult to open up sales channels. Transportation is also a difficult problem. Currently, only ships of the Java Shipping Company are sailing to Southeast Asia. A few weeks ago, a Southeast Asian merchant came to Shanghai to purchase goods, but returned empty-handed because the high prices in Shanghai made him afraid to act. As for the import of Southeast Asian goods, the number is also very scarce. Occasionally, some coconut oil and rubber are shipped out, but the number is also not large. Overseas Chinese hope for domestic goods very much, but the motherland really cannot satisfy their eagerness. Looking forward to Southeast Asian trade, it is currently difficult to be optimistic.

### Municipal Bureau of Education Begins Preparing for Students to Participate in Military Training

National Training Results Not Satisfactory

The Ministry of National Defense recently issued a nationwide order requiring all high school and above students to receive military training this year. The families of students in this city are extremely concerned. The reporter specially visited Li Ximou, the deputy director of the Bureau of Education. According to the conversation, the issue of military training for high school and above students this year has only been seen in the newspapers. The bureau has not yet received the order from the Ministry of National Defense. However, in order to prepare all the city's students to receive military training, the bureau recently sent personnel to various schools to investigate the current situation of "National Training". The results were not satisfactory. The reason is that the teachers dispatched by the Ministry of National Defense to various schools to teach "National Training" lack combat experience. Therefore, once military training is implemented, the actual ability of the teachers seems to be weak. Therefore, the bureau has prepared a document to the Ministry of Education to be forwarded to the Ministry of National Defense, stating that the teachers dispatched to various schools to teach military training in the future must have the following two qualifications: (1) Must have actual combat experience, (2) Must be graduates of the Central Military Academy. In this way, both knowledge and experience will be abundant, and the foundation for students to receive military training can be laid.

The city government received an order from the National Government stating that, according to the Examination Yuan's transfer of a submission from the Ministry of Personnel, the Personnel Work Review Meeting's resolution regarding the protection of current civil servants has been sent to the Ministry of Personnel for consideration when drafting the Protection Law. Before the promulgation of the Protection Law, please ask the National Government to reiterate the previous orders regarding the protection of administrative officials and instruct all agencies to comply strictly. If there are any violations of laws and regulations, the Control Yuan should file an impeachment and punish them according to law. The city government has repeatedly ordered strict compliance with the fact that before the enactment of the Civil Servant Protection Law, administrative officials in various agencies should not advance or retreat with political officials, and civil servants employed in accordance with the law should not be dismissed without cause. According to the previous situation, it should be reiterated and strictly implemented. After receiving the order, the city government has issued orders for strict compliance and instructed all subordinates to comply as one.

### District Chiefs Changed in Fourteen Districts

The district chief of the fourteenth district (Zhabei), Zhong Ketuo, has died of overwork and illness. The district affairs were previously temporarily handled by Deputy District Chief Sun Jingqi, who was dispatched by the city government. It is now known that the vacancy has now been filled by Wang Zhiping, the district chief of the 24th district, who took office in the district on the 19th of this month. He convened a meeting with all the staff and inquired about the work situation of each department. It is said that District Chief Wang previously served as the Deputy District Chief of the 14th District and is quite familiar with the local situation. In the future, local autonomy in Zhabei will surely be promoted.

### Village Chiefs Changed in Various Districts

Weng Ziyu, the village chief of the third village in the 23rd district (Wusong), has resigned. The vacancy has been temporarily filled by the deputy village chief Wang Baoli. Cai Guodong, the village chief of the 20th village in the 11th and 12th districts (Jiangning), has been elected as a municipal councilor and has resigned from the position of village chief. After the village held a meeting of heads of households, Cai Guo was elected to fill the position and Zhang Yuankun was elected as the deputy village chief. Ye Jinfa, the deputy village chief of the 34th village in the third district (Yimiao), has moved away from the village. After a meeting of household heads, Wang Jisheng was elected to fill the position. The districts have submitted reports for approval.

### Issuance of Flour in the Fifth District

The Fifth District (Taishan) District Office, considering the large number of impoverished households in the various wards under its jurisdiction in the southern part of the city, who are deserving of relief, sent a letter to the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Administration, requesting the allocation of relief flour. It is reported that the branch has replied in a letter agreeing to the request. The survey forms for all impoverished households have been verified, filled out by the wards, and submitted to the administration. It is said that the relief flour will be distributed according to procedure as soon as it is allocated by the relief branch. Furthermore, it is reported that the cooperative in this district has been actively promoting cooperative businesses since its establishment. Recently, a meeting of all councilors was held at the cooperative, where the development of the business was discussed.

### "Bankruptcy Wave" Strikes Hangzhou

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou, 10th

After the victory, the complexity of the receiving institutions caused unrest among domestic industrial and commercial enterprises. Unexpectedly, internal warfare erupted repeatedly, pushing these fragile industries and businesses into a difficult predicament. Now, we have reached the most dangerous eve. In all the major cities of the country, there are constant sounds of businesses and firms closing down, creating fear and trepidation. It is clear that we are on the verge of industrial and commercial collapse. If no rescue measures are taken, it is almost certain that we will wither away!

Bankruptcy Spreads Across All Industries

Hangzhou was originally a city known for exporting special products such as silk, tea, and tung oil. In previous years, it not only made Zhejiang wealthy through the export of these products, but also earned much honor in the international market. However, the post-war export of special products has become an extremely serious problem. There are substitutes or similar products in foreign markets. Domestic markets are plagued by chaos. In addition, currency depreciation, high costs, dumping of foreign goods, heavy profit-seeking exploitation, and heavy taxes have put special products in a difficult situation. Consequently, businesses and firms have gone from barely surviving to being unable to survive, and from being unable to survive to closing down and collapsing. The number is indeed considerable. This wave of bankruptcy has spread to every industry, especially tea firms. In the span of 36 days, 28 firms had already declared closure. Although there are no precise statistics on the closure of other shops and firms, there were 24 business entities in October that had already applied to the municipal government for registration and closure procedures. These included five cloth businesses, five entertainment businesses, one grain business, one electrical machinery and silk weaving business, two laundry and dyeing businesses, one silk business, eight native paper businesses, one general merchandise business, one preserved meat business, one native tobacco business, one timber rafting business, and one cotton weaving business. If the severity of the situation is expressed in monetary terms, it will exceed 200 billion yuan.

Reasons for Tea Firm Closures

According to those in the tea business, the reason for the closures of tea firms is the government's levying of commodity taxes on tea. During the peak years, Zhejiang province levied a special product tax on tea. Later, the provincial government abolished the special product tax in an attempt to revive the tea industry. However, the Commodity Tax Bureau started levying commodity taxes again. Since there was no way to export tea and the situation was already very difficult, businesses could not bear the tax and closed down one after another. Another reason is the exploitation by usurious loans. Tea business owners who used high-interest loans to run a tea business with low profits naturally found it difficult. Conversely, if the capital used to run the tea business was used for high-interest loans, they would have much less to worry about. Therefore, the tea industry fears that it will not be able to restore its former prosperity in the short term. The result of the tea firm closures is that tea farmers will have fewer outlets for their tea, and tea farmers will suffer additional blows and hardships. On the other hand, nearly 100 billion yuan of capital will become idle capital, engaging in speculation in society.

In addition to the severe exploitation and attractive temptations of high-interest loans, which caused many businesses to close down, another reason for the closures of many businesses is the decline in social purchasing power. Civil servants cannot earn enough in a month to eat well and dress warmly, let alone have extra money to buy new things. With the bankruptcy of rural areas and factories on the verge of collapse, farmers and workers also lack the ability to purchase goods. Moreover, due to the lure of high-interest loans, even the remaining purchasing power that has been forgotten and left behind is transformed into idle capital, joining the ranks of high-interest loans. Some people who obtain wealth through high-interest loans want to accumulate more and more, while others buy some things, but they are still a minority. Therefore, in the Hangzhou market, many shops can be seen day after day with lanterns and decorations, blowing trumpets and drums, and hanging large, inexpensive banners with gold letters, holding big clearance sales from spring to summer and then to autumn and winter, but business is still far less lively than in previous years. If these big clearance sales still do not generate profits, then the only option is to close down. The number of businesses closing down in this way will continue to increase, the amount of idle capital in society will continue to accumulate, and the number of production units collapsing will continue to rise. Meanwhile, goods from foreign countries are arriving in a continuous stream, being cheap and exquisite. There is no hope of selling our Chinese products abroad again, and because of the cheapness and high quality of foreign goods and the unrest in the domestic situation, there is no hope of exporting them to various parts of our country.

New Aspirations of the Business Community

Some say that to save China's current industrial and commercial enterprises, the government and banks must provide large amounts of low-interest loans. This goal is the beautiful aspiration that the business community in Hangzhou is unanimously pursuing. However, if the government provides loans, there are serious questions about the future use of the loans. For example, when purchasing silkworm cocoons at high prices, the government sets a reasonable price, but cocoon merchants still clamor that it is not high enough. In reality, the purchase price is often less than the price set by the government. The reason for this is that the banks have loans, and the government lends money to the cocoon merchants according to the set price. The cocoon merchants use a small amount of money to buy cocoons and use the remaining money for other purposes. These purposes are likely to be lending at high interest rates. Therefore, in order to ensure that these loans are indeed used by the industrial and commercial sectors and to truly promote the revival of industry and commerce, there must be strict investigations, rigorous lending procedures, and thorough assessments after the loans are made. Some people say that if these loans are released, will the currency not inflate even more and the currency depreciate even further? I believe that as long as these loans are directly lent to production units and truly make one yuan generate the effect of one yuan, it is still possible to revive a portion of industry and commerce.

Grandiose Old Slogans

In addition, we would like to put forward a grandiose old slogan that has been ineffective for decades: "Chinese people should use Chinese goods." First, we must cultivate the national psychology of loving domestic goods. I remember that before the war, in the Hongkou area of Shanghai, a Japanese child wanted to buy a box of matches. He went to a Chinese shop, and the shopkeeper told him: "We have Chinese matches, which are cheaper and better than Japanese matches. Why don't you buy a box to try?" But the child shook his head and left. He still went to a Japanese shop to buy a box of Japanese matches. This story can serve as a warning to us and can awaken us. Our industry and commerce are so fragile today, and only by doing this can we find a solution.

Encouraging the Export of Special Products

Hangzhou is a city for the transportation and sale of special products, and Zhejiang is an important area for agricultural and special products. If these many special products cannot be transported and sold to foreign countries in a short time, then everyone will collapse. Therefore, the government should invest heavily and be willing to encourage the export of special products, even at a loss. For example, the fact that nearly 28 tea firms have closed down due to the increase in commodity taxes is worth considering by the government.

The Need for Expert Research

We may also hire experts to conduct detailed research on these many special products and invent various other daily necessities, like Germany during the war, which could turn native products into substitutes for bread, and the United States after the war, which could make socks, leather shoes, and leather bags out of plastics. This can be attributed to research.

The wave of store and firm closures has fiercely struck Hangzhou, which relies on the transportation and sale of special products. We don't know when this strange wind will subside. We can only automatically strengthen and consolidate our houses to prevent this strange wind from blowing all our people into the ocean and being submerged by the waves.

### Re-education of Over Two Million Taiwanese Compatriots – Civic Training in Taiwan

— He Minxian

Taiwan, 12th (Airmail)

This year's National Day, which has great historical significance, marks the first day that 2,394,685 young men and women in Taiwan began to receive "re-education" in succession. The training has now been underway for more than a month. According to the relevant authorities, this unprecedented training program, which is being conducted on such a large scale and is so universal, can be regarded as unprecedented and truly pioneering. The training motivation, goals, and the content and process of the work unfolding are as follows:

Understanding the Actual Situation of Our Country

The motivation for Taiwan Province to give these two million citizens re-education is based on the fact that Taiwan Province was under Japanese rule for 51 years. During these long years of shackles, Japan consistently implemented a policy of isolation, gradually alienating our compatriots in the province from the motherland. Now that the province has been restored for almost a year, no one can deny that it is necessary for our compatriots in the province to have a deep understanding of everything about the motherland. The greatest purpose of this event is to exercise civil rights and to improve the foundation of our local autonomy. Following the instructions of Governor Chen, adult training should be held quickly to inform them of the history, geography, and customs of our country in a simple and clear manner, so that they can understand the actual situation of our country. Therefore, the "Taiwan Provincial Civic Training Committee" was organized to be responsible for presiding over and promoting everything. Because the educational level and law-abiding habits of our compatriots in this province are higher and stronger than any other province in the mainland, as long as they have a deep understanding of everything about the motherland in the future, they will definitely make incomparably great contributions to the country and the nation!

Six Training Objectives

Its training objectives are six: (1) to strengthen understanding of the Chinese nation; (2) to deeply understand the current situation of our country; (3) to actively promote the essence of the Three Principles of the People; (4) to fully develop the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace; (5) to comprehensively and universally promote government decrees; and (6) to train and disseminate popular knowledge.

Three-Tier Basic Organization

The basic organization for promoting this training work is divided into three levels of agencies: province, county (city) districts, and township (towns). For example, (1) at the provincial level: a Civic Training Committee is organized, composed of members from the Civil Affairs Department, the Education Department, the Propaganda Committee, and other relevant personnel, to preside over civic training affairs in the province, with Zhou Yi'e, director of the Civil Affairs Department, as the chairman; (2) at the county and city levels: committees are also established, with the county mayor or city mayor as the chairman; (3) at the district and township (town) levels: the district chief or township head is appointed as the supervisor.

Two Training Methods

As for the training methods, they are divided into classroom-style training, namely the establishment of "Civic Training Lecture Halls," and universal and extensive training, namely "Social Civic Training." (A) Civic Training Lecture Halls—lecture halls are established in each village, using local schools, churches, Sun Yat-sen Halls, and other public places as venues (if there is a shortage of teachers, lecture halls may be set up jointly by two to three villages; in the first phase, one man or woman aged 20 to 30 is designated to participate from each household; if the venue permits and there is no difficulty in finding teachers, two classes for men and women may be set up separately; the training period for each phase is set at one month, two hours per day, with the time arranged so as not to interfere with their work); (B) Social Civic Training—local cinemas and theaters are used as venues for implementing social civic training; for 30 minutes before each screening, slides are shown and lectures are given, or other methods are used to arouse their interest; at the same time, a 30-minute civic training course is broadcast on the radio station every day.

Eight Training Subjects

The subjects of the civic training lecture hall are divided into two major categories: political and sinicization. The former includes the promotion of government decrees and the exercise of the four powers, while the latter includes understanding history and geography and inculcating party spirit. The detailed content includes twelve items: (1) Mandarin Chinese, (2) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, (3) President's speeches, (4) New Life Movement, (5) History and Geography, (6) Essentials of Local Autonomy, (7) Summary of Provincial Administration, (8) Current Events Commentary, (9) Legal Explanations, (10) Physical Education, (11) Music, and (12) Others. Judging from the content of the above materials, they are the minimum that a citizen must know. If everyone can be well-trained, they will definitely gain a lot by the end of the period. Currently, the committee has compiled and printed 100,000 copies of these textbooks and is responsible for distributing them to meet their needs.

Local Teachers

Due to limited funding and the difficulty of recruiting teachers, the teachers for each subject in the civic training lecture hall are all recruited locally. The committee in each county and city hires local primary and secondary school teachers, administrative and autonomous personnel, party and state workers, government decree propagandists, local figures, and others with expertise in the training subjects. As for the personnel for social civic training broadcasts or lectures, the provincial, county, and city civic training committees hire those with knowledge and teaching experience. All of the above personnel are unpaid and only receive spiritual encouragement to assist in the development of public communication work.

Clear Assessment and Rewards and Punishments

In order to understand the implementation situation in each county and city, prepare for the reference for the second phase of the plan to begin next year, and ensure that this training does not waste time, manpower, and resources and can achieve satisfactory results, the committee sends inspectors to all 17 counties and cities in the province. It is expected that after this inspection, many valuable opinions will be contributed, and we will be able to better understand the actual truth of this training work. As for rewards and punishments, they are divided into three aspects:

(1) Include civic training work as part of the year-end performance evaluation of the county mayors and city mayors, district chiefs, and township heads who are responsible for presiding over each county and city, district office, or township.

(2) Citizens receiving training who are absent without reason, violate the rules of the lecture hall, or engage in other improper behavior will be warned or have their names posted in public, and will be punished with labor service (public service) for one to two days, depending on the severity of the circumstances (and they will still be forced to attend training after receiving the aforementioned punishment). If the circumstances are serious, they may be handed over to the local police authorities for severe punishment in accordance with the regulations on punishing violations of public order. Citizens receiving training who are of good character, abide by the rules, and achieve excellent test results will also be commended.

(3) Part-time teachers who serve diligently, teach hard, and achieve excellent results will be commended and given merit, and this will be included in the year-end performance evaluation of their original service organization.

Progress is Orderly

The civic training subjects have been described above. As for the content and materials, they are entirely aimed at citizens with a primary school graduation level. The writing and examples strive to be simple and clear. At the same time, teachers of each subject can supplement the content at any time. The progress is gradual and orderly. Each week, each unit. For example, the "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings" course is listed in the first week, and the six days are arranged as follows: on the first day, first talk about Dr. Sun Yat-sen's brief biography; on the second, third, fourth, and fifth days, continue to buy the Three Principles of the People, including the nation, the people's rights, and the people's livelihood; on the fifth day, focus on the psychological construction in the National Construction Program; on the sixth day, continue to talk about the political construction of the industrial plan and the founding of the country; the other seven weeks are devoted to the words and deeds of the martyrs, the New Life Movement, and local autonomy, and each subject is also distributed as evenly as above, in an orderly manner, so that the trainees can obtain a complete concept of each problem.

Hope for Joint Efforts

This civic training held by Taiwan Province is very important to the psychological construction of compatriots in the province. To build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People, we must pay more attention to their psychological construction. However, this arduous task requires the joint efforts of the government and the people. Citizens are the masters of the country. If they lack even the minimum intelligence and ability that a citizen should have, it greatly reduces the power to build the country. Here, I hope that the people in every corner of Taiwan will jointly assist the local government to complete the great plan of implementing civic training this time. Everyone should embrace the spirit of "those who know first awaken those who know later" and "those who are aware awaken those who are later aware" and give them practical help at all times in order to achieve brilliant results.

### Xinjiang Perspective (4)

— Special Translation by the Newspaper Editorial Office

If Chairman Zhang Zhizhong wishes to regain the confidence of the native peoples of Xinjiang Province, he must overcome two significant difficulties. First, he must obtain economic assistance from Nanjing to alleviate Xinjiang's declining economic situation, especially prioritizing the construction of roads to improve transportation. Second, he must eliminate the pervasive communist propaganda. Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union is exceptionally concerned about the political future of Xinjiang.

General Zhang Zhizhong, in order to restore prosperity and stability to Xinjiang, has specially hired ten of China's most progressive engineers to come to Dihua to develop plans for the city's development under Zhang's guidance.

Finally, Zhang urgently needs a team of well-trained and physically strong soldiers capable of enduring the harsh climates of the mountains and deserts to replace the current untrained recruits stationed at key locations throughout Xinjiang.

Medical Overview

Due to a lack of medicine, doctors, and hospitals, the public health situation in Xinjiang Province is extremely poor. Provincial officials state that unless relief measures are taken before the depth of winter, they fear that epidemics of typhus and cholera will cause utter devastation among the native Turkic Muslim population. In reality, while these two Asian epidemics are currently relatively mild, the diseases with rapidly increasing mortality rates in Xinjiang are smallpox, dysentery, malaria, syphilis, and typhoid fever.

According to estimates by health authorities, the infant mortality rate in Xinjiang Province exceeds 70%, largely due to smallpox and dysentery.

A severe typhus epidemic is spreading in the mountain pastures around Dihua. Unless serum and DDT and other preventative agents are rushed here from eastern China, the epidemic may soon spread to Dihua.

Dihua, with a population of 100,000, has only two hospitals: a general hospital with 400 beds and a mental hospital with 40 beds, both with extremely rudimentary equipment. The entire Xinjiang Province has a total of ten hospitals with 1,100 beds. The province's population is estimated by the government to be four million, while the Turkic Muslim population claims to be over seven million, but this vast population receives very little medical assistance.

According to health authorities, only three tons of medicine have been shipped to Xinjiang Province from eastern China since 1943. It is said that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) allocated medicine to Xinjiang Province two years ago, but due to a lack of transportation, this medicine remains滞留 in Kunming, Chongqing, Nanjing, and other places.

Xinjiang urgently implores UNRRA and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) to rush serum, sulfur preparations, DDT, and other preventative agents to save the critical public health situation there. A single plane could carry enough medicine to avert the crisis. This gives UNRRA and CNRRA an opportunity to prove the noble value of their humanitarian work.

Due to the political situation created by the successful Turkic Muslim rebellion, UNRRA or CNRRA medicine should preferably be delivered directly to Turkic Muslim leaders, without accompaniment by American or Chinese officials, otherwise the Turkic Muslims will refuse to accept it.

The Manas River is the military boundary separating China from the newly occupied area controlled by the rebels. It symbolizes the arduous tasks of political and economic construction that China faces. The "Great Western Bridge" over the Manas River, before it was washed away by floods in June of this year, was the only highway bridge in Xinjiang Province connecting the desert and mountainous interior with the fertile northwest border region. Now, only the hollowed-out remnants of the two adobe bridge piers stand facing each other on the banks of the Manas River. According to a government spokesperson, the authorities are not yet prepared to rebuild the bridge. Without this bridge, it is difficult to imagine restoring friendly relations between the Nationalist government in Dihua and the rebel government in Yining. Telegraph and telephone lines between Dihua and Yining have been cut off since the Turkic Muslim rebellion from September 19, 1944, to January 19, 1946, and have not yet been reconnected.

During the low-water period this summer, some freight trucks carrying Soviet cloth, candy, and cigarettes were still able to ford the Manas River to reach Dihua. However, the winter storms have arrived, foreshadowing the disruption of even this limited transportation. Therefore, until next summer, the only transportation route between China and Yining will have to rely on the irregular flights of Soviet airline transport planes. China is striving to restore the territorial integrity of its largest remote province, and it seems that even geography is working against China.

If General Zhang Zhizhong, the Chairman of Xinjiang Province, wants to regain the confidence of the four million Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, he must restore commerce in the heart of Xinjiang. In fact, most of Xinjiang's exportable products grow in the fertile three northwestern regions: Ili, Tarbagatai, and Altay.

Dihua, historically an important administrative city in Xinjiang, is now striving to maintain its position as a trading post for camel caravans between northern and southern Xinjiang. Now, apart from cosmetics, cigarettes, tea, and a small amount of cloth, almost no goods are transported from mainland China. Therefore, Dihua must obtain various supplies from the rebel government in Yining. However, apart from tea, cosmetics, and cigarettes, Dihua has nothing that Yining needs.

Dihua urgently needs goods produced in Yining such as grains, beef, mutton, animal hides, rice, fruit, gasoline, and gold. However, even if the Manas River Bridge is rebuilt and these commodities can be transported, Dihua will ultimately not be able to compete with Kazakhstan, because the latter has good roads, an abundance of consumer goods, and machinery that the Turkic Muslims in the northwest region need but the Chinese authorities cannot provide. What Xinjiang Province urgently needs is textile factories to weave local cotton and wool into cloth.

When Sheng Shicai excluded Soviet industries in 1942, he purchased a modern aircraft manufacturing plant from the Soviet Union for US$4.2 million in order to convert it into a textile factory. Sheng also purchased American yarn mill machinery from a company in Shanghai for US$500,000, but this machinery has not yet been delivered. As a result, millions of native people and thousands of Chinese soldiers in Xinjiang Province are without warm clothing and are preparing to endure another bitterly cold winter. There is a surplus of cloth in nearby Soviet territory, but it cannot be obtained for the following two reasons:

First, the Yining government fears it will oppose
The transport of the cloth to Dihua.
Second, Since Sheng Shicai closed the western borders of Xinjiang, the Soviet Union still
Has not concluded any trade agreements with Xinjiang Province.

Unless cloth is rushed here from mainland China via a 2,000-mile desert journey within a month, millions of native people and thousands of Chinese troops in Xinjiang Province will face the risk of freezing and starvation.

National Defense Highway

Recognizing the importance of defending its Central Asian border regions, China has allocated 30 billion legal tender yuan to build a military highway network to connect the vast remote province of Xinjiang with mainland China. Given that there are currently no preparations to repair the war-torn highways of the inland provinces, this lavish plan is worthy of attention. This new national defense highway trunk line stretches 1,700 li from Lanzhou in northern Gansu, across the Qinghai border, to Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province. The section from Lanzhou to Dulan, about 350 li, has been completed. From Dulan, it must cross a branch of the Kunlun Mountains, pass through the wilderness swamps of the Qaidam Basin, cross the snow-covered Arjin Mountains, enter the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert, and meet the ancient caravan route in Qakilik, cross the desert to Kucha, and then quickly cross the mountain roads of the Tianshan Mountains to reach Dihua. The necessity of this arduous undertaking lies in the following fact: currently, the only connection between Xinjiang and mainland China is the ancient Silk Road from Lanzhou through the Xingxing Gorge mountain pass in eastern Xinjiang Province to Hami. This medieval highway has often been attacked by bandits in recent months, posing a danger to passing merchants, who are often attacked by guerilla bandits who frequently enter and exit the mountains on the border of Outer Mongolia. The main purpose of this Lanzhou-Dihua highway is to prevent the isolation of Dihua, a key Chinese fortress in the west, and its strategic importance is no less than the new automobile highway that the Soviet Union is currently completing outside the western border of Xinjiang. This highway is located between Stalinabad and Khorog, passing through the Pamir Mountains at an altitude of over 13,000 feet. However, the difference is that the Soviet Union uses modern road-building machinery, while China must build roads manually in the severe winter. (End)

Publishing Industry Published Every Thursday

### Reprinting and Translation

— Traditional Prioritization

According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang himself in his report to the Legislative Yuan, the Sino-American Treaty allows the translation of American publications but prohibits reprinting. Some people worry that even translation is prohibited. For example, according to one interpretation, if an American work is registered or copyrighted with the Chinese authorities, then these publications should receive full protection from the Chinese government. We hope that the diplomatic authorities will clarify this point.

However, we also feel that the prohibition on reprinting in the Sino-American Treaty is superfluous. China is a scientifically backward country, and the number of Chinese people who can read English books is already pitifully small, and even those who can afford to buy Chinese books are not many. This restriction on reprinting does not benefit American publishers much, because the quantity that can be sold in China is very small. On the contrary, I feel that placing some pirated editions in Chinese bookstores can also have an advertising and promotional effect for the original author. Furthermore, from the perspective of Chinese readers eager to learn, this only prevents them from reading more Western books.

Frankly speaking, if reprinting and translation were not restricted by the Sino-American Treaty, and both sides were free to reprint and translate, it would be advantageous for China, because looking at the current state of the publishing industry in China and the United States, China would gain more from American works than the United States would gain from Chinese works. However, we must realize that American businesses have gained too much from the signing of this Sino-American Treaty. The United States is a strong country, and even if it suffers a little loss in this area, it can easily compensate for it in other areas, especially since this is greatly related to the exchange of Sino-Western culture!

This Sino-American Treaty appears to be equal on the surface, but it is unequal in substance. I feel that the true equality and false equality distinguished by Mr. Sun Yat-sen can also be applied to this aspect. The United States is a country with a highly developed industry and commerce, while China is not. Therefore, if it is said that China and the United States can freely navigate ships, this is equal on the surface, but in reality, the United States has ships, while China has no ships to sail. Furthermore, for example, if it is said that China and the United States can freely trade, but more American goods are sold to China, and fewer Chinese goods are sold to the United States, is this not unequal?

Since this is the case, why is navigation and commerce open, but the reprinting of publications prohibited? Those in the Chinese publishing industry only feel that our diplomatic authorities have not considered the cultural future of China.

### Reading "A Teacher's Diary"

— Yang Tongfang

Author: Feng Zikai Publisher: Wanguang Bookstore

Mr. Feng Zikai's "A Teacher's Diary" was published in Chongqing in June 1944 and reprinted in Shanghai in June of this year. A small portion of it was published in various magazines in the rear areas between 1939 and 1940. Seven years ago, I received a copy of "Cosmos Wind" from a friend in Hong Kong and read an article titled "A Teacher's Diary," which was the initial disclosure. I haven't seen it since.

From that initially published diary entry, I glimpsed how an artist living a peaceful life hastily bid farewell to Yuan Yuan Hall, and the arduous and embarrassed situation of leading his relatives westward. I felt deeply touched. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to see more records of his life since. Now that Mr. Feng has published his diary, I spent two evenings reading it under the lamp, with the same feelings I had when I first read that diary. My emotions seemed to rise and fall with the author's emotions, and I savored the life of this artist.

In literary works, generally speaking, biographies and diaries are the most moving, because both are true records of the author's own experiences. They can express the beauty of a person's personality and character. Among the two, diaries are the easiest to move people. Biographies are sometimes written by others, while diaries are all written by oneself. If we acknowledge the natural flexibility of essays in expression, we will definitely find diaries more adorable. The creation of essays is not like grand treatises, not as serious and solemn as writing "great articles." Sometimes it is based only on accidental feelings, fragmented observations, without elaborate depiction of forms and sentiments. Therefore, one feels that the emotions are lingering and the interest is endless. Generally, writing comes from innate nature, and what is inspired by the brilliance of the soul and what is revealed by practical experience must be more realistic and without falsehoods, natural and without artificiality. According to this, diaries are more in line with the conditions of natural expression. The diaries of various masters in the late Ming and Qing dynasties are still recited by people, and there is a reason for this.

Like Mr. Zikai's diary, although it is only a thin 160-odd pages, we can see the epitome of his wartime life and understand his daily lifestyle. His heart is completely immersed in art. Even in the most difficult and disappointing situations, he still has a warm heart full of hope. We all know the depth of Mr. Zikai's artistic talent. Artists have a sensitivity that transcends ordinary people. They can truly understand and observe everything in the world, and return it to its original appearance, without being blinded by various external temptations and prejudices. Therefore, they can shorten the distance between people and achieve the leisurely state of "observing all things in stillness and finding self-satisfaction." The reason why mankind has hatred, suspicion, and jealousy is really because the boundaries between people have not been broken. The "self-image" and "self-attachment" mentioned in Buddhism are indeed the source of stinginess and greed. After reading "A Teacher's Diary," we will definitely be able to appreciate how lofty and precious the mind of a generous artist is.

As the name suggests, this book "A Teacher's Diary" records the life of a teacher, including the author's entire life after going west to teach at Guilin Art School. After leaving Guilin Art School, he continued to teach at Zhejiang University, and a part of it can also be seen in the diary. The author taught at Guilin Art School and Zhejiang University, and completely adopted the method of inspiration rather than emphasis on inculcation in teaching methods. What he was responsible for was the art department. He did not focus on imitation and copying, but on stimulating students' creative spirit and improving students' appreciation ability. What was especially emphasized was to connect art with real life. The author believes that in order to achieve the purpose of art education, the entire life must be permeated with artistic elements, so as to realize "the artisticization of life" and "the life-artification". Indeed, art cannot be isolated. Art that is separated from real life cannot be called art. The author also wants us to open up a limit outside the intellectual and practical boundaries, then "all things in the world are new, and beauty is everywhere." How can this realm be appreciated by those who are busy with fame and fortune and enslaved by material desires?

After reading "A Teacher's Diary," we can know that Mr. Feng is not only an artist, but also an ideal educator. His diary is full of love for young people. In addition to paying attention to teaching materials and methods, teachers also need to have a loving heart. If teachers cannot sincerely love students, and cannot use ardent love to nourish students' minds, they will definitely not achieve the effect of education. Mr. Feng's words and deeds to his students often revealed deep love in individual conversations and accidental contacts. He is worthy of being a "teacher," using his personality to influence his students. That kind of care and concern, just like treating his own children, can be said to be completely from the heart and without any affectation, especially in the details. I think the author was influenced by Mr. Li Shutong (i.e., Master Hongyi) and Mr. Xia Mianzun, because both of them were Mr. Feng's teachers, and he had been influenced by their personalities.

The diary writes the most about the wartime scene, with records of heroic deeds, exposure of the enemy's atrocities, inspiring words, and deep feelings in the heart. Although sometimes inevitable indignation, inevitable sigh, but always no disappointment, no decadence. He firmly believes that China's War of Resistance will be victorious, because he saw thousands of young people becoming fearful in the War of Resistance, and thousands of descendants of the Yellow Emperor were fighting the enemy with their blood and flesh in the torrent of the war against aggression. His optimistic spirit towards the War of Resistance is as respectable as his tireless teaching spirit. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, perhaps his words seem meaningless, but in fact, it was very difficult for him to insist on the belief that victory was certain at that time. Especially after each setback and damage (such as the bombing of Guilin), he did not show any decadence or disappointment. Talking about the hardships of wartime life, he always said "misfortune is a blessing," in fact, this War of Resistance gave the mountainous country a chance for new life.

In this diary, between the lines is also overflowing with a strong human touch. At a glance, we know that the author's artistic accomplishment is deep. Even a small thing in life can be given an artistic observation. Trivial things around become a valuable source of life, and accidental small talks can set off endless deep meanings. A kind of amiable style of benevolence is the fusion of Confucian and Taoist thought, which is deeply artistic and expressed.

There are also many descriptions of exchanges with writers. The most mentioned in the diary are Chuan Binran, Bing Xin, Song Yunbin, Tang Xianzhi, Xia Mianzun, and Hongyi Master. His wife, Li Min, and his children, Chen Bao, Yu Zhan, Ci Ying, Yi Yin, and the newborn Xin Mei, are often mentioned in the diary. The harmonious atmosphere in the family did indeed nourish the author's lonely heart during the escape. Family chats and laughter, which ordinary people find meaningless, become vivid and moving descriptions in Mr. Zikai's pen. If he were not an artist with unique insights, who would have tasted the beauty of life and enjoyed the joy of being with family and children in the tense life during the war?

The conversations of village women and the songs of herdsmen and woodcutters fully express the nature and simplicity of agricultural society; and the author's life is immersed in these elements. At the same time, the author also understands the true meaning of the philosophy of life. He has a vitality of life, which is full of his thoughts, so what he says, even if it is very plain, can also give people a timeless and fresh feeling.

Anyone who has read Mr. Zikai's "Yuan Yuan Hall Essays" and "Yuan Yuan Hall Re-Essays" will definitely understand his attitude towards life. We always feel that his prose has a simple and distant artistic conception. He sees everything in the universe as beautiful, and he feels that everything is worthy of people's appreciation and taste. In his diary, we can also see this attitude towards life. Also, his writing is relaxed and lively, without any traces of carving. This is not so much the nature of his writing as the frankness of his character. Recently, he has a collection of essays published, titled "Frank Collection". I think the reason why Mr. Zikai's life is so desirable is because of his frankness.

Because his life is natural and frank, his diary contains a strong sense of humor, both serious and humorous, and can be quite fascinating. His writing does not have unique and wonderful points, but it can show unique and wonderful in the ordinary. He has already achieved the integration of truth into simplicity, the integration of world affairs into satire, and the ability to find pure and beautiful charm in blandness. Perhaps this is the reason why Mr. Zikai's diary can arouse the love of most people?

Mr. Zikai's comics have created a unique style. The advantages lie in the clear lines and realistic expression. I think his diary also has this characteristic.

### A General Theory of Chinese Historiography

— Yue Mu

Author: Zhu Xizu Publisher: Independent Publishing House

A general outline of the development of various systems in Chinese historiography is essential knowledge for every friend who loves history. The general youth must understand the development process of history, but also pay attention to the development of historiography. Because the records of history are not necessarily all reliable. Throughout history, most are the "official histories" of the royal family chronicles, and the records inevitably contain inaccuracies. Understanding the development of historiography can help distinguish between truth and falsehood. This can provide a lot of help in reading history.

This book, "A General Theory of Chinese Historiography," is the author's lecture notes from the Department of History at Peking University. Edited by his son-in-law Luo Xianglin, it provides us with a concise and essential overview of Chinese historiography. From it, we can gain insight into the development process of Chinese historiography throughout history.

First, the author discusses the origin of Chinese historiography. The original meaning of the character "史" (shi, history): "Shuowen Jiezi" explains: "史 (shi) records events, follows the '又' (you, hand) holding the '中' (zhong, middle), meaning upright." The author provides a brief explanation with literary examples. Then, it discusses: history based on written records, history of scribes, pseudo-historical accounts, and history inferred from ancient artifacts without written records. The author elaborates on the advantages and disadvantages of these various historical systems from the old era that were not called history. At that time, "history" was merely the not-very-accurate "official history" from the hands of scribes, which gradually developed and nurtured the seeds of history.

Regarding the schools of Chinese historiography, the author discusses six schools—from the Spring and Autumn period to the present day. These six schools are as follows:

(1) Annals: distinguished by time, also known as chronological history. This type of history began after the Western Zhou Dynasty. The eras before the Western Zhou are unknown, so this type of system does not exist. Common examples of this type of history include comprehensive works like "Zizhi Tongjian" and individual works like "Spring and Autumn Annals."

(2) National History: distinguished by place, also known as local history. It compiles the histories of various ancient states for observation. Ancient countries, both large and small, should not be omitted. Comprehensive examples include "Records of the Three Kingdoms," and individual examples include "Chronicles of Huayang."

(3) Biography: distinguished by people. Within these, "one can glimpse the level of civilization and barbarity of the place, as well as the gains and losses of society." Common examples include "Biographies of Women" and "Unofficial Biography of Dongfang Shuo."

(4) Political History and Cultural History: distinguished by category. Political history includes economic history, legal history, military and political history, party history, and diplomatic history. Cultural history includes academics, religion, literature, art, agriculture, industry, commerce, customs, and other items. Examples of the former include "Comprehensive Statutes" and "General Examination of Documents," "Tang Code." Examples of the latter include "Separate Records," "Seven Epitomes," "Song and Yuan Academic Cases," and "Poetry Criticism," etc.

(5) Official History: The so-called official history is not written by one person at one time, but rather a "official history" accumulated over generations, such as the Twenty-Four Histories.

(6) Veritable Records: recording the cause and effect of an event, this system was created by Yuan Shu of the Song Dynasty. Examples include "Veritable Records of Zizhi Tongjian," "Veritable Records of the Three Feudatories," and "Veritable Records of Western Xia," etc.

I have only listed the main points of the six categories above. The book elaborates on them in detail in separate sections.

Two appendices are included. One explains "The Interpretation of the Grand Historian," elaborating on Sima Qian's historiography. It is best to refer to Jian Bozan's "Historical Materials and Historiography," specifically the article "Sima Qian's Historiography," for more detailed understanding. The other is a study of the chronicles of the twelve generations of the Han Dynasty, from the chronicles of Emperor Gaozu of Han, through Emperors Hui, Gao, Wen, Jing, Wu, Zhao, Xuan, Yuan, Cheng, Ai, to Emperor Ping. The author provides descriptions and tables for these twelve generations of chronicles, presenting them more clearly.

Although the book is concise, its content can be considered extensive. Young friends who are beginning to study history can use it as a good reference material. Although omissions may be found, it can still serve as a reference for general beginners at this time. The book also points out many errors in historiography.

Today, everyone knows that history is an important discipline in the social sciences. It cannot be ignored by every young person. Before reading history, we must first understand the various departments of Chinese historiography, which will greatly facilitate our reading of history.

This book can serve as a preparation before reading history, or as a reference after studying history.

### The Devil's Pool

— Xu Peiji

Behind the simple and candid narrative lies a refined and elegant sentiment; this is a unique style of pastoral novels. Comparing the scenery of the natural world is like a small stream formed by the confluence of mountain springs. Although it is a faint trickle, the sound of water still echoes intermittently between the winding banks, with unfinished pure charm. In the crystal-clear riverbed, the gently undulating ripples on the water surface clearly show the potential of life, constantly leaping there. "The Devil's Pool" by George Sand depicts a simple and unadorned story from the French countryside. After being accustomed to magnificent and heroic works that reflect the times, it is like taking a refreshing drink in the scorching heat; it is also like the early autumn, bathing in the silky warmth of the morning sun in the slightly chilly breeze.

Ah! The unfolding of the story is as simple, straightforward, and unadorned as a farmer guiding his ox to plow a furrow. This furrow, on the vast wilderness, may soon be submerged by a second furrow, but the author's vivid and skillful narrative will forever preserve a deep imprint in the garden of life.

Look, the archetype of a country old farmer a hundred years ago – the rational Old Father Moreau – he persuades his son-in-law, hides his sorrow of losing his beloved daughter, and unselfishly advises his young son-in-law to remarry. But the young and handsome Jeunet, the honest protagonist in the book, uses his full passion to cherish his deceased beloved wife. In front of his lively young children, he is a considerate and loving father. In the village of Barre, his sincerity is loved by all the residents, and when the actions of little Marie have him in thrall, he is as ignorant as a child. But this ignorance, in some circumstances, can prompt his brave determination. When he stepped into the house of the widow Guillet, whom his father-in-law, Old Father Moreau, directed him to marry, he immediately discerned the different natures of exaggeration and glory. He cleverly withdrew from the hypocritical trap. The author doesn't directly describe the face of the innocent and intelligent little Marie, but only reflects her response from the depths of her soul through her words and actions. Her honesty and purity, compared with the pretentious behavior of the widow Guillet, the difference between them is so distant. Gentle, clever, the daughter of nature; she touched Jeunet who was approaching his thirties, she won the affection of Old Father Moreau, and she caressed Jeunet's son – little Pierre, who was not yet seven years old. In her eyes, there is no difference between the "love" she receives from others and the "love" she gives to others. But those who receive her "love" clearly feel that they have different weights! At the end of the story, Jeunet, with a nearly despairing mood, walks into the house of Mother Guillet – little Marie's mother – to seek the final decision of "love" from little Marie, she couldn't help but shout: "Didn't you feel that I loved you before?" Ah! The reader's heart will also be touched by her straightforward shout. It is not difficult for us to imagine what a delightful comedy will follow.

In the course of the story, the author applies her skillful technique to interweave little Pierre's charming language into the important joints of the whole book, which is exceptionally appropriate and flavorful. She also portrays the evil of the owner of Ormeau. When he bullies little Marie and Jeunet's way of punishing him is to drag him off his horse and press him to the ground; from the author's compassionate heart, one can see the author's view of life, and attitude towards art.

"A faithful depiction of the society in which an artist lives is a painful irony. He focuses on sin and suffering; but what do we artists of later generations depict? We will wait for the reward that anticipates death, which is the reward of mankind today. Will we pray for it to be the punishment for evil and the compensation for disaster?"

In Europe during George Sand's time, most art workers were accustomed to exposing the dark side of society, and accustomed to injecting somber satire into their works. Dürer, Michelangelo, Holbein, Callot, and Goya have strongly satirized the crimes of their countries, and their immortal works are historical documents of positive value. We will not deny artists the right to explore and expose social scars; but is exposure the only function of art?

Based on her true heart, the author recognized these vulgar and cruel views. She believes that the mission of art is a mission of emotion and love, and that artists should shoulder a major poetic task – "We would rather take mild and gentle characters that can be converted than terrifying villains that evoke terror, because terror will never correct selfishness, but only increase it." After affirming her artistic viewpoint, she also issued a hymn of "life" – a view of life and the universe.

"We should pay attention to life, not death. We no longer trust the empty of…to live richly, we must appreciate life. Lazarus should leave his dung heap so that people no longer need to rejoice at the death of the rich. Everyone should promote happiness, so that the fortune of a few does not become a sin and sorrow…We can no longer see death as the punishment for prosperity, or the comfort of disaster…We will no longer allow any graves to be the only escape for those whom we do not wish to make happy.

Using her correct thinking to measure the negative attitude held by the average person in today's society, the key to happiness that they abandon is so regrettable.

Writing to this point, we then close the book and meditate on the voices and smiles of the characters in the book, the lively and moving breath, containing a pure, fragrant and lasting flavor like olives. The end of the story is as bright as the afterglow after the wind.

Spring and Autumn

### My Recent Life and Writing

— Lu

Preface

It was on the afternoon of the seventeenth of this month, at the Literary Tea Party, that, on a whim, I proposed this topic and asked the friends who came to participate to write a little about their personal trivia. The intention was nothing more than to give readers a deeper understanding of the writer, and to add some interest to the publication.

I am grateful that the friends who participated that day did not take offense at my method of "assigned writing, submitting the paper on the spot." Everyone put aside their teacups and wrote it down in one go. A total of thirty-eight pieces were received at that time, and there were others who accepted the topic and were scheduled to submit their manuscripts later.

Now, in order of receipt, I will first publish the ten copies that have been organized. However, due to the limitation of space, the rest, together with the ones received successively, will be prepared for publication within the next week. I hope the friends will forgive me. —— Editor

One

Writing about the Tea Party

The tea is still bitter, and it will always have a bitter taste. It is precisely because of this bitterness that we cannot forget it. Talking in the bitter taste feels so delicious. What's more, the objects of conversation are all like-minded people who know the bitter taste, so they do not hesitate to talk more and do not distinguish the bitterness of the tea.

Two

My recent life is nothing more than teaching, editing, and writing. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I teach "Selected Songs," "History of Chinese Novels," and "Chinese Composition" in the Chinese Literature Department of Fudan University in Jiangwan. On Tuesday afternoons, I teach "History of Chinese Drama" at the Municipal Experimental Drama School.

I am the editor-in-chief of Beixin Bookstore, editing the monthly magazine "Youth World." This publication has a history of more than ten years and is a comprehensive publication targeting middle school and university students. The pre-war sales volume reached tens of thousands of copies. It is currently publishing the third issue of the new second volume. In addition, I publish the "Popular Literature" weekly in Da Wan Bao every Tuesday, and the "Folk Literature" weekly in the Central Daily News every Thursday. Mr. Dai Wangshu and Mr. Ye Dejun, who write for the Spring and Autumn section of this newspaper, are the main contributors to these two publications. Researching Chinese novels and dramas has almost become my obsession.

Because life is busy and there is no complete time, I cannot write a systematic and complete work, but only write scattered manuscripts for various publications. However, I suffer from having to cope with it, and I feel that there is nothing to say. Most of what I write is textual research on novels and dramas, and occasionally I also write some feelings about reading and watching dramas. All publications hope that I will write about literary anecdotes and reminiscences of the past, but I have already published "Literary Silhouettes" and "Literary Impressions." Although I have met many newly acquainted writers, I have no deep friendship with them. The biggest regret is that I have no time to read each writer's works in detail, so what I write with difficulty is not profound. I think writing this kind of article is the most ancient thing.

Three

I am afraid that I will not be able to write articles if I am not full.

Four

Mr. Jinshan's request for manuscripts was too great. As soon as I sat down, before I even talked to him, he gave me a topic to submit the paper. This is the way to test new students. It's a bit overwhelming. Fortunately, there is no limit to the number of words and no limit to the style of writing, so I will "take the exam" once.

I came from Hankou this time and passed through Shanghai to Beiping. Since the sixth of this month, I have been living a life of travel, so I am very unstable. But being able to meet friends whom I haven't met for more than ten or even twenty years is a very happy thing!

As for writing, I am very ashamed. The "Victory Travelogue" that I planned to write has just begun. After I settle down in Beiping, I plan to finish writing the two long novels "Great Fire Woman" and "In the Flames of War." In addition, I want to read more books.

I have been away from Shanghai for more than nine years. I am so happy to be able to meet many old friends today. I need to talk, so I will stop writing here.

Five

Recently, I returned to my hometown, which I had not returned to for ten years. After returning to Shanghai, I originally wanted to write some essays or the like to send to Jinshan. Coincidentally, the Wu Bao was published, and the editor asked me to continue writing "Wawa Diary." So I changed my plan, but after writing a few paragraphs, Wawa was spoiled and refused to write. Coincidentally, Bing Xin came from Hankou. She was going to Beiping to edit the monthly magazine "Literature and Life," and asked me for "literary works." I thought I would give her this unfinished Wawa Diary, but Wawa was too young, and I was afraid that she would not be able to withstand the hardships of the journey. Moreover, the season has already entered winter, and Beiping is terribly cold, and I am even more afraid that my Wawa will not be able to bear it; I have to think of another way.

Six

Speaking of my life, it is really insignificant. I remember when I was studying at school in the 20s, I read the debate on the scientific outlook on life, in which Mr. Wu Zhihui's outlook on life was "eating, having sons, and entertaining friends." In the past twenty years, my life has been nothing more than these three items. In my recent life, except for the second item, which I am not prepared to expand, the third item has always been consistent. Every time I decide to participate in a literary tea party, it is nothing more than wanting to greet more friends.

Speaking of writing, I am very ashamed. I am busy with eating every day, working as a lawyer on the one hand and doing business on the other. I really don't write often. If the editor asks me to write an article, of course I will not refuse.

Seven

Recently, in addition to handling fixed routine official duties every day, I also serve as a special writer for two or three publications during my spare time, so I am busy all day long. Dancing halls have no place for me, and at most I just watch a movie. I don't drink alcohol or smoke, and this has been the case for more than thirty years. In addition to writing, reading and reading newspapers are also daily necessities.

Eight

I am now busy teaching at three schools: Shanghai Merchant Marine College, Chengming, and Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, rushing to meet the time, and squeezing onto the tram. It can be said that "there is no time to spare"; therefore, the effort of writing is also very little. Before the summer vacation, I used to paint every day. Now I can only paint one or two paintings a week, and I can barely write one or two short articles; as for the planned revisions to the "Dictionary of Chinese Painters' Names" and the compilation of the "Collection of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties," they cannot be carried out, and I can only wait until life is a little more relaxed to work on them.

Nine

Life is monotonous, but there are poems to prove it:

"Everything seen must be recorded, everything heard must be written, the four seasons have no leave, when will it rest? Long gatherings instead teach estrangement of friendship, but on the eve of parting, I compose farewell sorrows!" (Part 1)

"Spring flowers and autumn moons pass by indifferently, snails' horns and roc's wings are all caught in the net, but I hate that the pen has been bald for a long time, what can I do with deleting poetry, books, and history!" (Part 2)

"As graceful as a startled swan, as lofty as a dragon, floating clouds and world affairs are the same in the nine provinces, please enter the urn, don't laugh at me, I am also confused in the painting." (Part 3)

Ten

Before the war, I lived a life of chalk dust, but I was trapped in Jiangnan and joined the guerrilla work, enduring a lot of wind and frost. After the victory, it was the first time to work as a civil servant. Perhaps it was a fluke that the job was very easy. So I openly carried out reading and writing work at my desk. After Xiao Qian returned to China, he presided over the literary editing of Ta Kung Pao and asked me to write regular book reviews for "Literature and Art." Living in an unsettled place and with a turbulent life, it is inconvenient to collect many reference books, and it is not easy to search for them. I know that I cannot provide many examples in my writing; writing a book review cannot discuss the entire creative process of the author in detail, which makes me feel uneasy and ashamed in my heart.

Eleven

I am a current primary school teacher. Speaking of primary school education, it should be so important that those who engage in education work should dedicate all their energy and all their time to our future generations. But now is an era when things do not go as desired eight or nine times out of ten, and cultural people naturally cannot forget their passion for literature and art.

I am currently writing short stories, but this era often cannot complete a work as one wishes. Of course, there are many reasons for this, and the most important one is the writing environment. It is difficult to produce literary works in an atmosphere where the entire life cannot be stable.

Twelve

Speaking of life, it seems that recently it is the same as in the past, and there is no change. The week before last, I went back home and lived a relatively leisurely life, enjoying some late autumn mountains and tasting the "oily chicken" flavor of Wang Si Restaurant, which I hadn't tasted for eight years.

Recently, my "Four Great Painters of the Ming Dynasty" has been arranged and proofread by the world, and the Commercial Press has signed a royalty contract with me for "Research on Color Science." As a result, it has aroused my interest in writing long manuscripts again, and I am preparing to complete a 30,000-word "Concise History of Emerging Chinese Art" before the end of the year. I really want to write it from a "materialistic" point of view. This is an attempt, and I don't know if I will be able to write it.

Thirteen

This semester, I taught at Dongyi University and Suzhou Provincial Industrial College, etc. In addition to the various things in the local area, I was so busy that I had no time to read. Recently, I came to Shanghai, although I am still busy, but it is much better. I go back to Suzhou every one or two weeks, and sometimes I go to Hangzhou. In terms of life, I have added a lot of fun. Stealing leisure from busyness, I really want to read some famous works of classical literature. I don't want to write for the time being. What I want to prepare for is to write a "General History of China," but this is not a casual matter, and I don't dare to say that I will definitely start writing it now.

Fourteen

Recently, during my spare time in the bank, because I am the editor-in-chief of the local Pudong newspaper "Dong Bao," it has affected my writing time. I hope to have some time to organize the manuscripts of "Special Ethnic Groups in Guangxi" first, and then write the two books "Research on Pangu" and "Exploration of Flood Legends and the Myth of Fuxi Creating Man." As for the outlines of the two books "Southwest Collection Notes" and "Collection of Drama Criticism" have already been roughly completed. If there is a chance to publish them, I can immediately organize them and send them to press.

Fifteen

Mr. Jinshan gave me a topic and ordered me to "submit the paper on the spot!" Although my brain juice is dry, I squeeze it horizontally and vertically, but I can't squeeze out a drop. But the order to submit the paper on the spot, ah! How dare I disobey!

Life, in the past, maybe it was because I was a bachelor, often was, with wine, I got drunk; with money, I used it; with time, I played; making a lot of noise, how happy it was! Walking in the middle of the night, and touring the garden in the heavy rain were common occurrences. Perhaps it was the relationship of the war, but it seemed impossible for a person's character to be calm in a troubled world.

Recently, I have changed. To quote a literary catchphrase, I have changed my style. I'm sorry, but it's not because I have a wife. (My wife is a "rat" from Hedong, but she can't roar like a lion. She's a stupid donkey!) However, I ask myself, life should be rectified. To be persevering and to be hardworking, that requires determination.

So, recently, I am determined and trying to temper my life!

Lately, although I also want to write, I lack the childlike naivety, the spirit of hard work, and even more, the trust in myself. Apart from occasional translations, I really dare not write. I really dare not write.

Sixteen

I am a journalist. During the Anti-Japanese War, I served in the press in the rear. Because I lived in the north for a long time, I was not accustomed to the life in the southwest, and my friends in the rear gradually disappeared, and I had a feeling of living alone! So I left Jincheng on October 21 and came to Jinghu to see friends I hadn't seen for a long time. In two or three days, I will go to the old capital I haven't seen for a long time to engage in journalism.

Seventeen

For eight years, I have lingered in Shanghai, which was shrouded in demonic atmosphere. I have not acted as a traitor. All year round, I only close my doors to paint. Sometimes I write a few short poems to express my feelings. Many friends think that I am as poor as I am, and I must have starved to death. Friends who care about me often ask about my recent life. I only ask them to look at a self-written couplet in my studio. The couplet reads: "Half a day for reading, half a day for painting. Sometimes planting vegetables, sometimes planting flowers." This is a realistic description of my life, but I feel that I have achieved nothing, and I am getting old. I feel very sorry for my friends who care about me.

Eighteen

Everyone knows that running news is the freest job. It is of course enviable to develop freely without any restraints. However, entering this circle also has very nerve-wracking aspects. Every day, I chase clues, rush for time, regardless of day and night, regardless of distance, and go everywhere to drill down and visit everywhere. I live in this kind of situation every day. But I am very happy, I think it is very interesting, and my mood is happy.

Because I am biased towards news reports, I have become indifferent to literary writing invisibly. But it is not giving up, it is not disgust, but really, it is the lack of time. So, in addition to writing news reports and newsy features, I can say that I haven't written anything else recently.

Nineteen

Because I participated in the Anti-Japanese War, I joined the Air Force. Years of mechanical life made me feel bored. So, in order to adjust my spirit, I engaged in writing and researching words. Recently, I wrote a book called Victory Font, changed the manuscript eight times, and made a plan for a new font. It retains the characteristics of the old Chinese characters and adopts the strengths of the characters of various countries. It solves the problem of homonyms in phonetic characters and the problem of dialects. Now it is starting to be published for the discussion and guidance of the cultural world.

Twenty

Mr. Jinshan:

Thank you for your concern in inquiring about my "life" and "writing" situation. I'm really sorry, recently my life has been very simple. Apart from reading newspapers and magazines every day, I have simply done nothing. On the one hand, it is because of the busyness of the store, and I don't have a calm mind to write manuscripts. No! To be frank, I am not qualified enough. However, I am a lover of literature and art. Although my strength is not enough, I want to learn and dedicate my sincere heart to learning. I hope to have more guidance in the future. It would be great if a "literary writing guidance group" could be set up in the "literary tea party."

### Chat with Literary Artists

— Lü Baihua

How could the beauty of culture lack gentlemen engaging in the arts, even more so, great talents; I offer a deep bow for the snow-boiling, engaging in delightful conversation, intimate and close.

Was it last week? Chen Chengyin invited me to the "Literary Tea Party." Originally, I wanted to see Sun Fuxi and Hualin as well. Fortunately, I also ran into Zhao Jingshen, so I wasn't lonely after all. Although this was my first time participating in the grand Literary Tea Party event, it is said that it was established fourteen years ago. But before those fourteen years, I remember often visiting Sun Fuxi's home. Back then, I was still young and deeply moved by this person who truly possessed "literature" and "art" and was also a refined recluse. His large bow tie, long hair, and gentle demeanor have been deeply imprinted on the heart of a weary traveler who has experienced many vicissitudes of life and will never fade away. At that time, he ran the "Artistic Wind" magazine. Because of the traveler's life of moving around, my time in Shanghai was very short. Aside from occasionally writing a few essays for the local supplement of your esteemed newspaper, I didn't contribute to any other publications. Soon after, I went to Nanjing, where life was relatively stable, but the daily routines and formalities entangled and overwhelmed my mind. I lived in "Sheepskin Lane," and every day I gazed at the riverbank and the sparse willows, thinking of Baili Xi's five ram skins. In this era, how could a poor scholar's worth be raised? So, whenever I had free time, I would pick up my pen and dispel my worries. The "Central Park" section of the Central Daily News, edited by Hualin, could be said to be my park for dispelling worries. "Baihua" was the pen name I adopted to commemorate my deceased mother, but the old writer Zong Baihua didn't mind. He wrote for the supplement of the Central Daily News, and it seemed we were proceeding side by side without conflict. I remember once, Hualin published my article under both my original name and pen name on the same day, gradually causing my original name to fade away, and many friends started calling me by my pen name. A short story called "Moon" from "Artistic Wind" was also sent from Nanjing at that time. My interest in writing can be said to have deepened, so even though I didn't participate in the Literary Tea Party, I formed a bond of literary friendship with its founder.

Now, fourteen years later, even before the Literary Tea Party has been restored in the five-story building of the Great New World, I have reconnected with friends from the Literary Tea Party; that was during the period from the end of last year to the beginning of this year. The "Literary World" monthly magazine that Wei Jinzhi and I co-edited was discontinued due to unsustainable sales. At the same time, Guo Lanxin wanted me to temporarily edit a supplement for a certain newspaper, but I left due to issues with the payment. I only taught at Zhijiang and the Law and Politics School, feeling bored. At this time, Lu Danlin was editing "The Beginning of Man" and invited me to help him. Perhaps it was a matter of resonance, we got along very well. And there was Chen Chengyin, whom I had been meeting frequently for many years, even until now. It was only through Xu Zhongnian's article that I learned that he and Lu Danlin were both mainstays of the Literary Tea Party. I am a layman when it comes to literature and art, and besides, in my middle age, filled with sorrows and joys, I can no longer muster the courage to "write at once when mounted." However, the vague past and present circumstances have unconsciously created a little warmth and some closeness towards the Literary Tea Party in me. Grasping Sun Fuxi's hand again, he said:

"You haven't changed a bit!"

This made me smile bitterly. More than ten years have passed, how could I still be the same? There were many people there that day, and Chengyin patiently introduced me to them. I thought of "The gentleman transforms like a leopard, his culture becoming brilliant." The "culture" in literature and art should be metaphysical to achieve the brilliance of virtue and accomplishment. "Engaging in the arts" is even more of an instruction from the former sages. However, the "great talents" I mentioned in my poem do not necessarily refer to "a great talent, tall and imposing." The original meaning of the word "great" is "large." Why does literature and art start with tea and not wine? I agree with this very much. Wine can lead to recklessness, while tea can purify the mind. Outside the passes, snow is flying. If we use snow water to brew tea, that would be even better. See "Classified Assemblage of Affairs":

"Dang Taiwei obtained snow water to brew tea and asked, 'Does the Dang family have this pleasure?' He replied, 'How would they know this? They can only drink lamb wine under gold-decorated tents.'"

In this way, friends of the Literary Tea Party, gathering in a "place of books and records," would not fall into clichés! This has already been explained in the few points for improvement discussed by Chen Chengyin, Hualin, and Xu Zhongnian in "Spring and Autumn" a few days ago. A little warmth and some closeness made me write such an unpresentable poem.

### Interesting Anecdotes from the Literary World

— Zhan Weng

When Chen Shiyi lived in Suzhou, he was eighty years old. He usually regarded himself as the chief of the poetry world and used his age to act old and sell his seniority. Shao Tanqiu from Nanchang happened to pass through Wumen and was introduced by Jin Songcen to visit him. Chen Shiyi regarded him as a young upstart and treated him with disdain. Shao Tanqiu was furious and pointed out more than ten errors in Chen Shiyi's poems regarding the use of allusions. Chen Shiyi was stunned and unable to answer. The next day, on the Shangsi Festival, there was a ritual gathering at Black Dragon Pool in Nanjing, hosted by Cao Lianheng, Shao Yuanchong, and others, who revered Chen Shiyi as their leader. Shao Tanqiu then wrote an essay titled "The Poem Calamity," severely criticizing the shamelessness of poets mutually praising each other, leaving Chen Shiyi completely humiliated. Observers all praised Shao Tanqiu for his straightforwardness and decisiveness. Chen Shiyi suffered this great blow and began to look at Shao Tanqiu with new respect, no longer daring to act old.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 99

— Ye Jingfeng

Therefore, it was not easy to get through this kind of "five-level test." Even the best results required forty-eight hours. That is to say, from the first to the fifth level of testing, you had to answer satisfactorily, with no point where you lacked "logic," and at the same time, you had to endure the torture under each test. However, it was also common for some people to get through by pulling strings and getting more lenient treatment during the tests. For example, when Tsurumi Tama returned to the country this time to be tested, powerful figures had already intervened on his behalf beforehand. Because Tsurumi was a top-notch talent among the "young and vigorous faction," the association should have recruited him, so after only forty-eight hours of various procedures, everything for the "initiation ceremony" was completed at midnight that day.

Having passed the five-level test and successfully becoming a member of the Black Dragon Society, Tsurumi found it much easier to explore the "seven sealed letters." Although he was quite excited, he was physically exhausted and constantly thinking about the disclosure work after obtaining the "seven sealed letters," so he thought of going to Ueno Park to relax a bit, partly to restore some energy and partly to clear his thoughts in preparation for the next step of work.

Who knew that after just taking a few steps, he suddenly felt someone coming out from under the eaves of a house corner, following him. In the perception of ordinary people, there would of course be no response to this kind of thing. Tsurumi had something on his mind and had also undergone quite rigorous training. He himself was someone who engaged in this kind of activity, so of course it was easy for him to notice. Moreover, it was already midnight, and there were few pedestrians on the road, making it easy to distinguish whether the person was following him or just an ordinary pedestrian.

However, Tsurumi didn't make a big fuss when he discovered someone was following him. He just silently noted "one" in his mind. That is to say, he had discovered one person tailing him. Little did he know that just after noting one, there were as many as five more, coming out from the left and right dark corners of the street, remotely trailing at a considerable distance, following his every step. If it were only the Black Dragon Society sending people to complete the procedure and create a kind of "pledge of allegiance," that would be a trivial game to Tsurumi, and he wouldn't be flustered at all. But Tsurumi was someone who concealed heavy, even triple, secrets, so how could he be careless?

"Are they the spies of the Lan Group? Are they the mortal enemies of the Black Dragon Society, the Jiangchuan Restoration Society? (Most of the people in this Restoration Society were former partisans of the shogunate, and they were politically opposed to the Black Dragon Society in domestic affairs.) Or are they other newly emerging dangerous enemies in the dark?" Because at this time, the war of aggression against China was already brewing successfully. The military, political, and financial circles, those who were greedy for credit and wealth, had already established many factions, competing for profit externally and competing for power internally, or even competing for both power and profit. Each party squeezed out the others, possessing assassins who specialized in carrying out assassination work.

In normal times, not to mention just five or six people, Tsurumi wouldn't even put them in his eyes. Even if there were twice as many, he would have to weigh them carefully, joke with them first before talking. You have to know that Tsurumi's "judo" was nearly at the seventh dan level, making it easy to deal with ten or so people. His "kendo" had also passed the fifth dan level, and he had learned from a famous kendo master of the time, undergoing special training that allowed him to face a sword bare-handed. As for his marksmanship, in addition to receiving a special shooting skills award at the Army University, he had won the first prize at the military's suburban "Umu" group. But why did he come to Tokyo? Why did he join the Black Dragon Society? Wasn't it all to expose the secrets of the seven sealed letters of several international evil leaders?

### Blood Plasma

— Shao Fu

The blood plasma trading case has become one of the fashionable topics. In fact, it is just the same as other commodities, such as automobiles, steel, aircraft materials, military blankets, and ration food boxes. What's the difference? However, because it is blood plasma, something fresh from inside the human body, everyone is paying special attention to it.

The U.S. Foreign Assets Disposal Committee should bear the responsibility for this incident. First, the merchants purchased it from the Disposal Committee through formal procedures, neither stealing nor smuggling. Second, the blood plasma was mixed in with many items, and no one knew about it beforehand, and the Disposal Committee never announced a ban on trading. Third, the term "black market" is not very appropriate to use here. Experts bought in bulk, added interest, freight, and losses, and wholesaled it to pharmacies, so naturally they had to raise the selling price. Pharmacies openly priced it for sale. Is this a black market? Is raising the selling price a black market?

Since they sold it themselves, how can they say that the buyers are violating the law? If they are violating the law, the first violators are the sellers. So, above all, they should have considered it more carefully when they originally put it up for sale.

Now this batch of blood plasma has been sealed up. Those engaged in this windfall trade are truly in a state of mixed emotions. They are now saying that as long as there is a reasonable price, it can all be taken back. Although there will be losses, there is nothing they can do. They hope that the host can consider this approach, otherwise, merchants will not dare to trade with the Disposal Committee in the future.

### A Swift, Decisive, and Delightful Original Judicial Performance: A Report from a Foreign Reporter

— Liaoran

American journalist William Ayers once lived in the Communist "Liberated Areas" of Shandong for some time. After returning to Shanghai, he recently published several articles in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury about his memories of the "Liberated Areas." The most interesting article was the one describing how the Communists handled the case of a traitor. Because from this article, we can see how the Communist judicial organs are organized, how they exercise their powers, and what the Communist judicial concept is. The article begins by describing the peaceful tranquility of the Chinese countryside. Suddenly, the article writes: "Secretary Hu said, 'There will be a mass meeting this afternoon... We are going to execute someone.'" The matter was so sudden that the number one traitor in the area was to be tried. There was no public announcement beforehand, and no newspaper published the news. The leaders of the various small groups that were firmly organized in the Communist regime all received the following order: "Select a few people from your group to attend a meeting this afternoon." There was no preliminary hearing, in stark contrast to the International Military Tribunal's trial of war criminals from Japan and Germany.

Secretary Hu told me (the reporter claims) that the traitor did not have to be tried, as long as he repented and admitted his guilt. In the twenty-four hours that followed, the Communists I spoke to all unanimously believed that as long as the traitor was willing to repent, he would not have to be tried. Every time I heard this, I was shocked, because this statement had a religious tone, which contradicted the Communist materialism... The Communist Eighth Route Army's method of dealing with prisoners was to educate them through persuasion, first criticizing the other side's wrongness in conducting the war, then praising the Communist Party, and finally showing them that peace was more valuable than war for them personally. If the persuaded prisoners expressed repentance and determination to reform, they could be released; otherwise, they had to be tried. The traitor to be tried this time, a certain Wang, had undergone a year of persuasive education by the Eighth Route Army without repenting, so he was to be "tried" on August 31. Here, the word "trial" is similar in name but different in substance to the "trial" used by the International Military Tribunal to try Japanese and German war criminals. The trial that the traitor Wang underwent could actually be considered to have already taken place unofficially during that year of persuasive education. The trial I witnessed that day was merely the announcement of the verdict. There was no need to guess what the verdict would be; everyone already knew the outcome.

The Drama

"About two thousand people were sitting on the platform. The curtain was raised on the platform, and in the middle sat Judge Sun, with two judges from the 'government' on his right and three judges sent by people's organizations. On his left were Prosecutor Yu and the clerk. When the truck carrying the prisoner arrived, there was a moment of silence in the court... I was reminded of the drums of the French Revolution. The truck stopped in front of the stage, and two policemen escorted the prisoner, whose hands were cuffed behind his back... The prosecutor began his indictment... After the prosecutor finished his indictment... Judge Sun asked, 'Is the indictment fair?' The defendant replied, 'Some places are wrong, some things I didn't do.' Question: 'Do you want to summon witnesses?' Answer: 'I wouldn't dare trouble the court.' Then Judge Sun walked towards the crowd at the meeting and asked what the people's opinions were. No one spoke. 'According to the crimes committed by the defendant, he should be sentenced to death. The court has already discussed it. What are your opinions?' Judge Sun waved his fist in the air and shouted, 'Kill!' Then the crowd shouted three times, 'Kill! Kill! Kill!' Judge Sun took out the written judgment from his pocket and read it line by line..." After reading it, the defendant was shot on the spot. (See the full text in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury on November 14)

From the above facts, the Communist judicial concept is primitive, backward, and barbaric, and is far removed from the modern democratic judicial concept. According to the principles of democratic politics, judicial power and administrative power are separated, while Communist justice is purely an appendage of the administration. Communist justice has no so-called "principle of legality of punishment," and guilt is not necessarily punished. As long as one is willing to "repent," one can be declared innocent; if one is unwilling to repent, one must be sentenced to death. Therefore, the entire Communist justice system can be encompassed in just eight words: "Those who obey me live, those who oppose me die." Communist justice is merely a means of achieving political goals, and has no independence in itself. Therefore, as long as the political goals are achieved, the judicial means can be dispensed with, and the defendant is naturally acquitted. The judges have people's representatives, which seems to be a jury system. However, the people's representatives under the Communist Party are merely nominal. Even the "crowd" attending the meeting is selected by the "leaders of each group" according to orders from above, so the people's representatives on the jury are even more chosen by the Communist Party themselves. It is conceivable that even if they are truly elected by the people, their task is probably only to be present. If the chief judge does not shout "Kill!" they probably would not dare to shout "Kill!" first. Don't you see those "masses"? When the judge asked for their opinions, no one spoke until the judge waved his fist and shouted "Kill!" Then they followed with "Kill! Kill! Kill!" It can be seen that these jurors are used to deceive the people, and their opinions cannot affect the verdict at all. Furthermore, the judicial organs represent the state in exercising criminal punishment, and have the right to punish those who should bear criminal responsibility according to the law, without soliciting the opinions of the general public. Communist justice is not like that. On the one hand, the outcome of the judgment is already known to all, and the judge has already written the judgment and put it in his pocket; on the other hand, he pretends to ask the masses how they should be judged. Although his hypocrisy is ridiculous, this action is completely incompatible with the modern concept of justice!

Conclusion

Communist justice has no system of appeals, no so-called appeals, retrials, protests, or rehearings. Once a judgment is made, it is immediately executed. Even if the judgment is improper, there is no way to remedy it. There is also no preliminary hearing, and the trial procedure is very simple. There is only prosecution, no defense. The defendant is not only physically restricted (wearing handcuffs), but also has no one knowledgeable in the law to defend him. Therefore, a case can be concluded in just a few tens of minutes, which is vastly different from the year it took for the Netherlands to try German war criminals, the half a year it has taken for Tokyo to try Japanese war criminals, and the several months it takes for the Shanghai High Court to try each case of a traitor. Modern democratic countries all recognize that the purpose of punishment is to prevent crime, and criminal proceedings adopt the principle of discovering the substantive truth. Therefore, the defendant is presumed innocent before the verdict is made, and evidence favorable or unfavorable to the defendant should be investigated, and the defendant should be given the opportunity to defend himself and the opportunity to make a final statement. The Communist Party believes that justice is the superstructure, and the purpose of punishment is only to eliminate obstacles to communism. Therefore, all so-called levels of review, defense, investigation, and preliminary hearings are naturally absent. This kind of justice is far removed from the judicial concepts of modern democratic countries, so it is said to be a primitive, backward, and barbaric judicial concept.

### Thinking from Photographs

— Zuiyin

No matter how fierce a person is, when taking a photo, they always like to have a bit of a smile; even if they don't smile, they have to put on a look that gives people a good impression of them. The reason why humans are different from animals is probably because they have a little more of this.

So, when you look at those different faces in front of the photo studio window, you always feel that those people are like "good people," they are all "smiling," and they are all powerful and promising; no face lets its ferocious true nature appear in the lens. It is said that this is certainly a falsification of hypocrisy, but social order depends entirely on this to maintain it.

These words were spoken to me by someone not long ago. At that time, I only felt that the speaker had some insight. Unexpectedly, today, I feel more and more that the above in-depth and simple statement is really reasonable!

Look: from Göring of Germany to Zhou Fohai of China, these executioners of war and accomplices of aggressors, when they arrived in court, all spoke eloquently, talking a lot of nonsense. If we were a little naive, we would really think that this world is full of benevolent, righteous, and moral great people. Before committing suicide, Göring also tried to spread his will, saying a lot about the "future mission of the German people," etc. He was not unrepentant until death, he certainly knew that he had been acting recklessly in the past, but even though he understood it in his heart, he could not help but "sanctify" it with nonsense in his mouth, trying to make people see him as a revolutionary; furthermore, even a heinous traitor like Zhou Fohai could not help but come up with a set of blind and absurd defenses. Fortunately, compatriots in Shanghai and many other occupied areas are still alive and not too forgetful, otherwise, Zhou Fohai's "simply moving people's hearts" eloquent talks would really make us fall into a fog!

What I am most interested in is: since the public trial of the number one traitor Chen Gongbo, all of them, big and small, have been grandly confessing and speaking plausibly. Among them, some knew that it was difficult to escape death, but they still refused to be frank and all tacitly gave a lot of rhetoric and put on a "moralistic" appearance. This is just like: when taking a photo, even a great thief who has killed countless people will show a bit of kindness and amiability.

In this day and age, no one exposes their heart anymore. Everyone is acting in a foolish way! No wonder, a few years ago, a baby in Manila died after three days because his heart grew outside his chest!

### Private Life

— Saintly

Starting with Xia Peizhen

Fifteen years ago, Xia Peizhen, a female movie star second only to Hu Die, was sentenced to one year in prison after the victory due to a drug case. According to reports, she will soon be released. This news reminded me of the past of this red star who once starred in "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple."

In 1932, she joined the Star Film Company and began the life of a movie star in that golden age. At that time, her income, excluding remuneration, was a monthly salary of two hundred yuan, and the price for filming one day was seventy yuan. This kind of generous treatment was beyond what ordinary people could compare to. However, she became addicted to the world's worst habit because of this. Her artistic achievements were destroyed at this point. Later, when she left the Star Film Company, she had a legal dispute with the company. For a time, she was a news figure known to women and children. However, the flood of poisonous substances gradually eroded her youth and vitality, and she became depressed. She rarely performed in the film industry. When we recall this history of the artist's fall, we also feel infinite regret! Reality is always the most ruthless! Thinking of Yuan Meiyun from Xia Peizhen, this pair of red stars with black records both committed the same problem. Their future was ruined in "one wrong step," and now there is no way to solve it!

The hard life of film and drama artists evokes our sympathy, but precisely because of working day and night, and having a more free lifestyle, it is easiest for their private lives to collapse. One wrong thought can lead to irremediable consequences. I am not preaching here, but as an artist, one must be able to manage oneself and restrain oneself. Otherwise, once emotions are released and unrestrained, the degeneration, corruption, and white killing and martyrdom, those sentimental behaviors, are enough to kill the individual and kill art!

After a while, he heard the people below shouting loudly, and he knew that he was almost at the top. He opened his eyes and saw Lu Xun standing against the wall, about ten feet away from him. Mi En felt a little dizzy, but not afraid at all, and even felt happy. He said, "Lu Xun!"

"It's Mi En."

"Hmm."

"I'm here to accompany you down, you don't have to worry, I will take care of you."

Lu Xun moved slightly, but did not turn around. He said, "I can only do that. I know people will definitely misunderstand me. But, I can't worry about so much."

"I climbed up so hard," Mi En said happily, "How did you get up here?"

Lu Xun said, "I smashed his head and then shot her. His head didn't break after all. The stick actually bounced off, and my hand hurt so much."

"It doesn't matter," Mi En said, "Now everything is over."

Lu Xun suddenly raised his head and shouted in a special tone, "Mi En!"

"Oh, Lu Xun!"

Lu Xun paused for a long time, and then asked, "Do you think doing this will hurt her heart?"

Mi En replied, "God! She certainly won't be sad. She will never feel anything."

"Do you think that's for sure?" Lu Xun asked with a strange laugh.

"I think that's for sure."

"That's great. Then, let's go down now." He immediately stood up.

"Mi En shouted," Stop! Don't do this!" But Lu Xun took up his gun and fired at his own head. With a bang, blood splattered, and his body slowly leaned over and lay down.

Mi En listlessly stared at his corpse, still leaning tightly against the ladder. The people below all shouted together. He closed his eyes tightly and shouted, "It's all settled, there's no need to panic now."

When Mi En got into the car, the police officer handed him a letter, but he didn't have the heart to pay attention to it at all. He simply forgot about it. When he got home, he felt around in his pocket and remembered it.

The envelope was addressed to Dr. Mi En. Mi En looked at it and felt very sad, but it was obviously not written by Lu Xun later on. He tore open the envelope and looked at it. There were four one-pound notes and two ten-shilling notes inside.

He looked at it for a long time, then put it back into the envelope, put it in his pocket, and closed his eyes. He didn't sleep all night, of course he was too tired to support himself. (End)

### News Figure: Overseas Chinese Tycoon Aw Boon-Haw

— Whirlwind

Aw Boon-Haw has arrived in Shanghai.

According to Mr. Aw, the purpose of this trip is to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing and report on the situation of overseas Chinese. In addition, he will visit President Song and Minister Yu to seek instructions on the future development of the Fujian Economic Construction Company under Mr. Aw's leadership.

Some newspapers reported that Mr. Aw enjoys Peking opera and various local operas, and that he had been to the Gong Wu Stage to see a theatrical production with elaborate stage machinery. One evening newspaper ran the headline: "Aw Boon-Haw Watches 'Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes'," which was nothing short of an unpaid advertisement for the Gong Wu Stage.

Thinking of Tiger Balm

Mentioning Aw Boon-Haw immediately brings to mind Tiger Balm, Eight Treasures Pills, and Headache Powder produced by the Tiger Balm Yong An Tang. "Tiger Balm Yong An Tang" was established by Mr. Aw single-handedly. Currently, branches have been established in Rangoon, Java, Siam, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, Fuzhou, Tianjin, and other places. There are also special agents in major ports around the world. The popularity of its sales is truly remarkable. However, it is said that when Mr. Aw first started the business, he personally led his staff, dressed in colorful tiger costumes, to promote and peddle their products to various businesses. Through diligent management, he eventually rose to become a wealthy overseas merchant, which was no easy feat.

Mr. Aw's ancestral home is Yongding, Fujian, but he was born in Rangoon, Burma. His father took a "big-eyed chicken boat" (named so because the bow of the sailboat had two large eyes painted on it) to Rangoon fifty years before the founding of the Republic of China, established the Yong An Tang Chinese medicine shop alone, married a woman surnamed Li, and had two sons, Boon-Haw and Boon-Par.

Mr. Aw is known for his generosity and vigorously supports general charitable and public welfare undertakings, which cannot be compared to "charity scammers." He has initiated the establishment of middle schools in various overseas locations to provide education for overseas Chinese children, built medical facilities, and established elderly homes, benefiting overseas Chinese quite substantially. Worthy of note is Mr. Aw's concern for national affairs: during the Northern Expedition, the September 18th Incident, and the January 28th Incident, he donated large sums of money and a large quantity of medicines each time. During the Anti-Japanese War, his support for the motherland was also considerable.

Starting a Newspaper in Shanghai

Some say that Mr. Aw's visit to Shanghai this time is to prepare for the publication of a Shanghai edition of the "Star" newspaper series, to be named the "Star Shanghai Daily," which is his [illegible] business "feeling [illegible]." This move [illegible]. Aw Boon-Haw's newspaper business began in 1921 when he invested 50,000 yuan in Rangoon to establish the "Burma Morning Post." In 1928, he invested 500,000 yuan in Singapore to establish the "Singapore Daily," dominating the Singaporean newspaper industry. In 1931, he also founded the "Sin Hua Daily" in Shantou. Given the strength of Mr. Aw's capital, his newspaper business certainly has a good chance of success.

In Pasir Panjang, Singapore, Mr. Aw once independently opened a large-scale swimming pool with attached basketball courts, tennis courts, badminton courts, etc. A sign was posted stating "Chinese Only Allowed to Swim." Comparing this to the sign of the past in Shanghai that read "Dogs and Chinese Not Allowed," it is a reflection of changing times.

Mr. Aw is now sixty-four years old, but his spirit is as vigorous as ever, and it seems that he has several more ventures waiting to be completed!
