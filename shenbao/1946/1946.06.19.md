### Xu Yongchang Visited Marshall and Zhou Yesterday; Negotiations Enter Important Stage; Unified Military Organization Awaits Yan'an's Reply

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Peace negotiations have transitioned from individual consultations to the important stage of overall resolution. Chairman Chiang's three points, as outlined in the ceasefire announcement on June 6th—restoring sovereignty over the Northeast, restoring transportation, and reorganizing and unifying the military—regarding (1) and (2), involving the Northeast Communist Army's garrison areas, the number of reorganized troops, various police forces, and (3), the unified organization of Communist forces in various regions, are, due to the approaching ceasefire deadline, effectively integrated and have become the issue of Communist defense zones, the issue of Communist military reorganization, and the issue of Communist transportation corridors, representing the final test. Major negotiations are expected on the 19th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] With only three days remaining until the ceasefire deadline, hope for peace remains tenuous. It is reported that the result of the meeting between Special Envoy Marshall and Zhou Enlai at 10:00 AM on the 18th clearly indicated a significant impasse in the peace process. This is because Zhou Enlai, representing the CCP, explicitly stated that they hoped for further revisions to Chairman Chiang's proposal, delivered to Marshall for transmission to the CCP last night, concerning the Northeast Communist Army's garrison areas and the plan for unifying the Northeast Communist forces, to grant the Communist forces greater concessions. It is said that Marshall personally urged Zhou to consider the matter carefully, advising against making excessive military demands. Subsequently, given the importance of military reorganization, it was agreed to continue discussions today. According to sources close to one side, the CCP delegation has sought instructions from Yan'an regarding the key points of the CCP's military plans related to restoring transportation and unifying the Communist forces, and instructions are expected to be received today or tomorrow.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The Democratic League, the Youth Party, and a group of enlightened figures who came to Nanjing, convened a meeting at No. 15 Lanjiazhuang on the morning of the 18th to meet with CCP representatives Dong Biwu and Li Weihan, to receive a detailed report on the progress of the negotiations. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, they invited government representatives Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen to report at the National Assembly Hall. According to sources on that side, the current negotiations focus solely on the three issues of ceasefire, military reorganization, and restoration of transportation. Regarding the military reorganization issue, there is considerable hope regarding territory and the number of reorganized troops. The restoration of transportation should, in principle, be easier to resolve, but there are current complications regarding bunkers and transportation police. Furthermore, after listening to the reports from both sides, these figures will hold discussions at Fengyi Village at 3:00 PM on the 19th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] According to the Ministry of Transportation, if the current KMT-CCP negotiations succeed, the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways are expected to be repaired within two months, with the Jiaoji Railway possibly being repaired within two weeks. Simultaneously, railway construction starting from Jinan can also begin. Once the railways are repaired, the vehicles currently located in Jinan and Qingdao can be immediately deployed for use.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Government representative Xu Yongchang visited General Marshall at 4:30 PM on the 18th, departing at 6:00 PM. He then accompanied Yu Dawei to the Lizhi Society to meet with CCP representative Zhou Enlai for two hours. The issues discussed were very concrete.

### Zuo Shunsheng Discusses the Current Situation; Third Parties Should Maintain a Fair and Impartial Attitude; Future Political Negotiations May Change in Format

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Propaganda for the Youth Party, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai a few days ago with Liu Dongyan, the party's Minister of State. When asked by reporters today about his views on the current situation, Zuo stated: "If the CCP is sincere and the government can make concessions, these negotiations will 'have results, but it won't be very pleasant.'" Regarding the reorganization and unification of the Northeast armies and the issue of Marshall's arbitration, Zuo believes that greater difficulties will be encountered, as the CCP is very firm in its demands regarding so-called "local governments" and garrison locations. He also stated that third parties should maintain a fair and impartial attitude to promote progress in the negotiations between the two sides. Zuo continued by pointing out that the Democratic League's spokesperson, Luo Longji, was biased towards the CCP with his statement, "The KMT has a hundred faults and not a single merit, while the CCP has a hundred merits and not a single fault," which lacked the impartiality expected of a third party. When asked if political negotiations between the two sides would continue after the expiration of the Northeast ceasefire deadline and what form they would take, Zuo replied: "The continuation of political negotiations after the end of military negotiations is essential, because political issues are fundamental to the country's politics. Once negotiations resume, the Youth Party will put forward concrete suggestions on political issues." Zuo also stated: "Whether the negotiation format will continue to be the convening of a comprehensive committee is currently unknown, but I believe it may be changed, because the Comprehensive Committee was established by the Political Consultative Conference. Now that the PCC has not been reconvened for a long time, and the issues discussed by the Committee cannot be finalized by the PCC, the Committee has no foundation. Therefore, future political negotiations may adopt another format."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The government sent a memorandum to the Military Mediation Department on the 18th, listing the facts of the Communist army violating the agreement and attacking the National Army after the signing of the ceasefire agreement on March 10th. It also hopes that the Communist army will quickly abide by the agreement, immediately stop attacking, and resolve the problem peacefully.

### Bode Flies to Shenyang, Transfers to Changchun; Jireen Meets Marshall and Returns to Shanghai from Beijing

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] Bode, accompanied by central representatives Li Minran and Wang Shoudao, left Ping by plane for Shenyang at 8:35 AM today, transferring to Changchun. Rao Shushi, the CCP representative in Changchun, is in Shenyang and may board Bode's plane en route today. Bode's trip is to prepare for the expected establishment of a Northeast ceasefire plan, so that the plan can be quickly implemented once it is established. The government side of the Executive Headquarters has greatly adjusted the personnel of the Northeast Executive Group. The leader of the 27th Central Group has been replaced by Lieutenant General Zhang Hanchu. Recently, it is planned to add four Northeast subgroup numbers, designated as 34, 35, 36, and 37. The leaders of these groups have been selected, Cai Wenyu for Group 34 and Huang Jiexin for Group 37. The candidates for Groups 35 and 36 have yet to be finalized.

### Precondition for Mediating the Shandong Situation; Conveyed to the CCP by Marshall; Communist Army Should Withdraw from All Occupied Cities

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The Communist army must withdraw from Dezhou, Tai'an, Laizhuang, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Jiaoxian and other cities and towns occupied after 12:00 noon on June 7. It is said that this requirement has been conveyed to the CCP by Marshall, but the CCP has not yet given a concrete reply. The general opinion is that if this matter is not discussed as a special case, but is attached to the negotiations on restoring transportation and withdrawing the Communist army along the railway, it will give the CCP a great deal of face, because according to the "66" ceasefire agreement, the National Army has the right to withdraw the Communist army from the above-mentioned areas. After the issuance of the "66" ceasefire announcement, the Communist army's actions are not straight with the people, and this is the most prominent example.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] Regarding the Shandong conflict, the government side of the Executive Headquarters insists that the Communist army must first withdraw from the cities occupied after June 7 before it can respond to Chen Yi's request to send the Xuzhou and Jinan subgroups and senior personnel from the Executive Headquarters to Linyi for a meeting. Under the circumstances that the Communist army has not withdrawn from the cities occupied after June 7, the government has even considered withdrawing the government personnel of the Executive Group in Shandong Province. According to official sources, the situation in Qingdao has eased, but the situation of Jinan being besieged has not changed. A telegram from Jinan today stated that the war is still taking place in the area 20 to 25 kilometers outside Jinan.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] After the death of Lei Fenqiang, the government representative of the Yancheng subgroup, Chairman Chiang was extremely saddened upon hearing the report. Today, a telegram was sent to the Executive Headquarters stating: "The telegram from Committee Member Zheng of the Beiping Executive Headquarters on June 15 has been received. Major Lei Fenqiang was tragically murdered in Sunzhuang, which is deeply regrettable. It is said that the deceased's father was also a revolutionary martyr who died in the Northern Expedition. Father and son sacrificed themselves for the country, which is particularly commendable. Their surviving relatives should be comforted and generously compensated by the Ministry of National Defense to comfort the loyal souls. Chiang Kai-shek, June 18, Beijing."

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th Dispatch] Military News: (1) Communist troops have been discovered south of Guodian North Lijiazhuang He Erzhuang, and within two kilometers north and south of Licheng, seemingly planning a large-scale siege of the outskirts of Jinan. (2) The Shandong Military Region Special Task Force and the main force of the First Division, totaling over ten thousand Communist troops, attacking Danggiazhuang Shao Nan Zhuang Xinglong Zhuang, are currently attacking in four routes. Our defending troops are meeting them head-on, and the battle is extremely fierce. The Communist troops at Dajiangou and Sherongzhuang have been driven back by us, but the Communist troops near Shaoerzhuang and Danggiazhuang continue to increase and are still confronting us. (3) The Communist troops attacking Changqing and Qihe, totaling about four thousand, stopped attacking Changqing last night, and their main force shifted to the Qihe area to join with reinforcements coming from Yancheng and attacked us fiercely. Due to being outnumbered, our defending troops suffered many casualties, and the position was once breached, resulting in fierce street fighting. Fortunately, our defending troops from Jinan quickly came to the rescue, and the Communist troops were eventually repelled.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 18th Dispatch] Communist troops have suffered heavy casualties in recent days attacking the outskirts of Qingdao, and their lower-level cadres have suffered many casualties. On the morning of the 18th, the National Army recovered Bushang Wangjia, and also recovered Chengyang (50 li away from Qingdao). The Communist troops retreated north in a panic, and order in Chengyang is gradually being restored. The administrative organs have moved back to work.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th Dispatch] After capturing Dezhou, the main force of the Communist army moved north. Their 17th and 18th Regiments and the Hui Muslim Brigade are gathered in Xinqiao and other places southeast of Cang County, attempting to invade Cang County.

### Jiang Jiadong Reports in Beijing; Recounts the Details of the Tragical Events in Tanjung Priok

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press conference on the afternoon of the 18th. Jiang Jiadong, the Consul General stationed in Batavia, attended the conference to report on the occurrence and causes of the Tanjung Priok incident. He stated: "Java is currently in a state of extreme chaos. No government or army can be responsible for the security of the entire island and protect our overseas Chinese. There are more than two million overseas Chinese in the South Pacific islands, scattered throughout the area, even in remote rural areas. Therefore, when there is war, our overseas Chinese will inevitably suffer losses. The Tanjung Priok massacre, in which more than 1,000 overseas Chinese were killed and injured, is not the first time. If the situation continues to be unstable, it is feared that similar unfortunate incidents will continue to be unavoidable in the future." The loss of life and property of overseas Chinese can be divided into three categories: (1) Sacrifice in the struggle between the Indonesian natives and the Allied forces. (2) After the Allied forces withdrew, the Indonesians suspected that the overseas Chinese would help the Dutch army and retaliated. (3) On the periphery of the front line, they were robbed, abused, and murdered. Our government has already made demands to Indonesia for the arrest of the murderers and for compensation. Finally, Director He Suqiu of the Ministry replied to reporters' inquiries that "Indonesia is only a revolutionary organization, and our country has not yet recognized it. The current government is striving diplomatically to promote peace between Indonesia and the Netherlands in order to protect overseas Chinese." He also said: "Effective measures to protect overseas Chinese are also underway, but it is not yet time to announce them."

### Talking About Xuzhou Amidst the Sound of War Drums

— By Our Special Correspondent Xu Shou-lian

Your correspondent arrived at the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai railways – Xuzhou – on the evening of the 8th. During the enemy and puppet occupation, this important commercial and military town underwent an unknown transformation of manpower and resources, having been built into a new city with a modern appearance. Therefore, when we stepped out of the station, we discovered that the historically renowned and glorious ancient Pengcheng had undergone a complete transformation – wide streets lined with towering new buildings, although the street lights were dim.

Today, Xuzhou has become a target for the Communist army. They are eyeing this piece of land covetously, but they dare not act rashly because Xuzhou has sufficient troops to resist and defend itself. The National Army has deployed 300 bunkers in the suburbs, and three armored vehicles patrol the ring railway. In addition to the defense forces, the police and the security regiments are also shouldering the responsibility of defending the city. The security of Xuzhou is ensured without worry.

Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order has been disregarded by the Communist army! Not a day, not an hour, goes by without them attacking the National Army. The seven counties under the jurisdiction of Xuzhou – Lu, Pi, Tongshan, Dangshan, Feng, Suining, and Pei – have all been attacked mercilessly; the people have suffered the ravages of the Japanese army for eight years, and are now continuing to suffer these ravages. However, in the past, it was our enemies who oppressed our compatriots, but now it is our "compatriots" who are oppressing us, which is truly heartbreaking!

When we – the group of reporters – arrived at the old airfield outside Xuzhou, a great picture of displaced people unfolded before our eyes. Whose masterpiece is this?

Thousands of temporary thatched sheds shelter tens of thousands of refugees. They have been "liberated" from the "liberated areas," they have been "struggled" out by those who "fight" for justice, they have abandoned their fields, left their homes, their families have been broken, and they are encountering the tragedy of life and death in this world.

Men, women, old, and young, faces difficult to count, with a sallow complexion, with millions of eyes containing infinite grief and indignation, filthy and tattered clothes, a gust of wind brings a stench that suffocates.

Is this the human world? Is this hell? Are these the people who achieved final victory after eight years of resistance against Japan? I don't believe that these are the people of China at the end of the 20th century!

The group of reporters toured the field, and they looked at us with fear, pity, and curiosity! They spoke with various accents – Anhui, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu...

Currently, there are approximately 70,000 refugees in Xuzhou. Apart from a portion who live in the urban area with relatives and friends, the municipal government has designated three concentration areas: the old airfield, the foot of Paoma Mountain, and the old Yellow River滩. Every day, more than a dozen people die from epidemics or in battle, but the number of refugees continues to increase, and it is said that including the suburbs, there are more than 200,000.

The Su-Ning branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has provided 1,000 tons of wheat as an emergency measure, and the local authorities have also contributed 5 million yuan from charity sales, but how much real benefit can the refugees get from this amount!

People place great expectations on Xuzhou, because there is a capable Mayor, Luo Dongfan. "Effective governance does not require much talk." Let us look at the successful municipal administration of Xuzhou:

1. Organize Baojia: Xuzhou City is divided into 479 Bao, 5140 Jia, and 62,344 households, with a total population of 337,341. All are elected by the people, and the municipal government holds at least one spiritual lecture for them every month to give them a correct ideological understanding. The party, government, military, and people of Xuzhou can all work together, which will be of great help to municipal construction.

2. Overview of Education: Xuzhou City has one university – Jiangsu College, with 300 students. There are 14 national, provincial, municipal, and private middle schools, with a total of 7,097 students. There are 69 provincial, municipal, and private primary schools, with 16,202 students. All students are able to concentrate on their studies without any student unrest.

3. Public Burden: Xuzhou is an important military station, so in theory, the public burden for firewood, fodder, and military supplies is very heavy, but in fact, it is not so. The Pacification Commissioner's Office and the municipal government authorities are both planning for the people and trying to reduce the public burden as much as possible. From January to the end of May, it has been reduced to 80 percent. This is truly benevolent governance, and this is also the reason why the people are happy to cooperate with the municipal authorities.

Xuzhou City, with a population of more than 300,000, is developing rapidly, but it is still far from the goal of becoming a modern city. The first problem is electricity. Electricity is the foundation of all construction, but today, Xuzhou's two power plants have limited power generation due to outdated machinery. The second problem is drinking water. Xuzhou still does not have a water plant, and drinking water is taken from earthen wells, which makes it very easy to become a medium for infectious diseases. Also, due to the old Yellow River, there is a lot of sand, which can lead to bladder stones. (Now I hear that a water plant is being prepared, with a capital of 1.5 million yuan.) The third problem is fuel. Although Xuzhou has coal transported from Jiawang, the mining methods have not yet been improved, and production is limited, so most of the fuel still relies on sorghum stalks. In the event of a famine, there will be a fuel panic.

During our five-day stay in Xuzhou (from the 9th to the 13th), the tense situation on the periphery meant that we had to abandon our planned trips to Damao on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and Hanzhuang on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, which were close to the so-called "liberated areas"! Although we had requested permission from the American representative of the Three-Man Group and the Communist representative, we were "politely" refused. On the morning of the 13th, we only sent a representative and a photographer to fly to Lincheng, which had been besieged for eight months, for a tour. Upon our return, we held a farewell tea party for all sectors of Xuzhou at the Political Department of the Pacification Commissioner's Office that evening.

On the morning of the 14th, our group continued on the Longhai Railway to visit our second target – Kaifeng.

During our five-day stay in Xuzhou, we were warmly received by all sectors, which made us feel very ashamed. In particular, Teng Jie, the director of the Political Department of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and Wu Yizhou, the chief secretary, gave us many conveniences for our interviews. Here, we would like to express our deep gratitude to all sectors of Xuzhou! (Written on the Longhai Railway on June 14)

### Investigation of Current Financial and Economic Situation: Legislative Yuan Submits Preliminary Report, Requests Administrative Authorities to Answer Ten Matters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Nine-Member Joint Committee organized by the Legislative Yuan to investigate the current financial, economic, and monetary situation held two meetings on the 15th and 17th of this month. At the 302nd plenary session of the Yuan on the 18th, Chairman Zhang of the Committee submitted a preliminary report, first pointing out that the price issue was the most serious problem in the financial, economic, and monetary aspects a month ago. Although this problem was formed by several objective reasons, "the failure of human planning and the lack of careful consideration of policies are also undeniable facts." The report pointed out: (1) the recent Shanghai fraud case, (2) the China Textile Company's high-priced sale of yarn and cloth, (3) the taxation of customs duties and commodity taxes based on black market prices, (4) the customs release of large quantities of luxury goods, and (5) the increase in public utility prices, using these five points as examples to illustrate that they all have a "direct stimulating effect on price increases." It also stated that "the competent departments may take this as a good strategy to increase national treasury revenue, but they do not know that with the widespread increase in the prices of goods, the national treasury expenditure is more than ten or a hundred times the revenue, resulting in the opposite result. Thus, high prices and paper money issuance are mutually cause and effect, creating the current situation." The report then raised ten major questions, requesting administrative authorities to provide answers. These are the ten major issues: (1) the amount of currency issued; (2) foreign exchange and gold reserves, and the situation after the opening of foreign exchange; (3) the quantity of relief goods from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the distribution methods; (4) the types, quantities, values, and handling methods of enemy and puppet materials; (5) the current situation of private industry and commerce and the relief policies; (6) the profits of state-owned enterprises in the first half of this year; (7) the status of industrial and agricultural loans in the first half of this year; (8) the true situation of the treatment of officials in state-owned enterprises and agencies; (9) the status of loans and vehicle allocation; and (10) the content of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau. After Chairman Zhang finished his report, Committee members raised three questions and specifically pointed out that the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau was established without legislative procedures, which is incomprehensible. It is said that the purpose of the bureau is to supply the necessary materials to poor civil servants, but it has been established for several months, and civil servants have not seen any real benefits, so it should be given special attention.

### Lively Debate on Amnesty Case, Decision to Submit for Re-Discussion at Next Meeting

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The long-shelved amnesty case sparked another lively debate in the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting this morning. The case was decided to be postponed at the last meeting, and today, Li Jinfang and 32 others made a temporary motion to request re-discussion. The proponents explained the scope of the amnesty, stating that the scope of amnesty reviewed by the Legislative Yuan does not include traitors, corruption, heresy, and criminals whose original sentence is the only death penalty. In addition to the above, the death penalty and life imprisonment will only be reduced as appropriate, so only ordinary fixed-term prisoners can be pardoned. This kind of measure to start anew with the people should not have any drawbacks. At that time, members such as protested against it, and then the chairman submitted it for a vote and passed it, and it was submitted for re-discussion, but due to the lateness of the time, it was decided to submit it for discussion at the next meeting. Regarding the issue of civil servant treatment, in today's Legislative Yuan regular meeting, some people advocated that it should still be implemented from July according to the Yuan's resolution of 1,000 times the basic salary plus 200,000 yuan for the basic salary, and jointly appeal to the Chairman of the National Government and the Supreme National Defense Committee.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The 302nd meeting of the Fourth Legislative Yuan was held at the Yuan at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th. Sixty-six members attended, and President Sun presided over the meeting. First, Zhang Yuan, the convener of the Nine-Member Joint Committee, submitted a preliminary work report of the committee, and then the following five important cases were amended and passed: (1) Amendment to the Organization Regulations of the National Father's Mausoleum Management Committee; (2) Regulations on the Management of Self-Defense Firearms; (3) Amendment to Article 5, Paragraph 5 of the Organization Regulations of the Anti-Smoking Committee of the Ministry of Interior; (4) Amendment to the Tax Rate in Article 3 of the Deed Tax Regulations; (5) Amendment to the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law and the Implementing Regulations of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law.

Local Dispatches

### People in Northern Jiangsu Living in Deep Water and Burning Fire, Desperately Awaiting Government Rescue, Fudan University Northern Jiangsu Students and Teachers Appeal

[This Newspaper, Yangzhou Dispatch] Professors and students from Northern Jiangsu at National Fudan University, in view of Northern Jiangsu's proximity to Nanjing and Shanghai, and its extremely important strategic position, have suffered oppression from the enemy and puppets for eight years, leaving the people impoverished and destitute. Just as they regained their freedom, the people were able to escape from deep water and burning fire. Who would have expected that the Communist army, under the name of liberation, would seize Northern Jiangsu, implement various tyrannical policies, arbitrarily massacre, confiscate people's property, forcibly conscript and equip soldiers, extort food from the people, and even incite so-called class struggles, in an attempt to destroy the vitality of our Northern Jiangsu's reconstruction, and to plunge the nation and the people into eternal ruin. Their cruel and inhuman actions are even worse than those of the enemy and puppets. Our Northern Jiangsu compatriots cannot bear their trampling, and they flee en masse, supporting the old and carrying the young, wandering around Yangzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. They do not have enough food, are filled with grief, have no fixed place to live, and their plight is unbearable. They have experienced these atrocities and tyrannical policies firsthand, and have decided to appeal to the following relevant agencies, requesting rescue. The main points are as follows: (1) Request the government to drive the inhuman Communist army out of Northern Jiangsu and save the people from their suffering. (2) Immediately rescue out-of-school youth and provide universal relief to our displaced compatriots in Northern Jiangsu to prevent starvation. (3) Clarify the administration in Northern Jiangsu and work hard on reconstruction.

### "Red Serpent" Kills Jin Shuzhong, Filial Daughter's Revenge Case, Sentenced to One Year and Three Months

[This Newspaper, Dispatch] Jin Lingjun, a woman from Jin Huibiao in Yi County, is now seventeen years old. Her father, Jin Shuzhong, was killed by Huang Muquan, nicknamed "Red Serpent," and others in July of the 28th year. Therefore, Lingjun had long harbored the desire to avenge her father, but she was too young and weak to do so. As she grew older, her desire for revenge intensified. On the morning of November 15th of the 34th year, Huang Muquan was drinking in the Nanhua store, and Lingjun saw him. She immediately grabbed a kitchen knife and, taking him by surprise, slashed Huang Muquan twice in the face. He was injured but not killed. Jin Lingjun moved the knife forward to the county police station to surrender. The station escorted her to the county government for judicial investigation. At the time, it caused a sensation throughout the county, and society sympathized with this filial daughter's revenge. Now this case has been repeatedly investigated and publicly tried by judicial officials, and the trial was held on the 13th. Jin Lingjun was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to one year and three months of imprisonment, with a three-year suspended sentence. During the period of suspension, she will be placed under probation. The case of Huang Muquan and others jointly killing Jin Shuzhong has also been investigated and tried by the judiciary and found to be true. At the same time, a judgment was announced. Huang Muquan was found guilty of joint murder and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, with ten years of deprivation of political rights.

### Wu Zhihui Passes Through Wuxi to Shanghai

[This Newspaper, Wuxi Dispatch] Central Supervisory Committee member Wu Zhihui passed through Wuxi to Shanghai at 12:00 noon on the 17th. It is rumored in the county that Wu's visit to Wuxi is not confirmed, but some local people were waiting at the station to welcome him.

Also: The treatment of public school staff and faculty is notoriously poor, and with the fluctuating and rising prices, it has long become a problem that urgently needs to be resolved. The new standards for public school staff and faculty announced by the Central Government this time are based on 380 times the base salary of public school staff and faculty in Beijing and Shanghai, plus a living allowance of 70,000 yuan, while the salaries of public school staff and faculty in various parts of Jiangsu Province are 240 times the base salary, plus a living allowance of 55,000 yuan. Therefore, the public school staff and faculty are panicking, believing that the difference in treatment is too great and very unfair. They have made requests for improvement to Provincial Chairman Wang and Education Director Chen, but have not received any satisfaction. The Provincial Education Federation Temporary Representative Assembly has sent a telegram to the faculty and staff of provincial middle schools, announcing a general leave of absence starting on June 17th. All faculty and staff of the Provincial Xishi School in this county have unanimously responded to the general leave of absence, pending further instructions.

### Chaozhou National Assembly Representatives Plead for the Hungry People of Their Hometown

[This Newspaper, Chaozhou Dispatch] Chaozhou has always been an area lacking rice, relying on more than 1.5 million bags of rice from outside to meet its needs each year. Currently, the source has been cut off, and Shanghai has banned the export of rice, making it impossible to purchase and transport it, resulting in starvation everywhere and successive deaths. This spring, there was a drought, and rice seedlings were planted out of season. The price of rice is as high as 100,000 yuan per 100 kilograms, causing panic among the people and no end in sight. Chaozhou National Assembly Representative and fellow townspeople in Beijing, Zhou Gongdu, and others, concerned about the serious disaster situation in their hometown, have jointly requested that the League and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration allocate a large amount of rice and flour for relief, in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of people.

Editorial

### Starting from the *Hong Kong National Daily* Incident

On the 5th of this month, the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters announced the second list of traitors to be arrested. To uphold the government's measures to severely punish traitors, the *Overseas Chinese Daily* in Hong Kong, which should be considered a cultural traitor, published an editorial on the 7th, strongly condemning the traitors. Unexpectedly, it was punished by the Hong Kong government with a one-month suspension. The public opinion circles of our entire country are already very surprised at the Hong Kong government's intention to protect traitors. In today's widespread international movement for freedom of the press, the excessive oppression of the *National Daily* by the British, who have always been known for respecting freedom of speech, feels even more like a perverse act against the tide. From a broad perspective, although this is a relatively minor matter, it is, in any case, a regrettable stain on the relationship between China and Britain.

During the World War, Britain was our ally, fighting shoulder to shoulder in Southeast Asia, expressing deep sympathy for our country's resistance against Japan, and providing considerable assistance. Even after the war, for its interests in the Far East, Britain needs to maintain friendly relations with our country even more. Our country, for the sake of the safety of the Far East and world peace, is naturally willing to maintain the close relationship with Britain during the war, with unwavering friendship. However, there is a practical problem that seems to prevent the discord between China and Britain from completely disappearing. This newspaper's editorial has repeatedly pointed out that the recovery of Hong Kong is a common "national aspiration" of the people of our country. Evidenced by the development of many recent sporadic facts, we are even more convinced that Britain should return Hong Kong to China as soon as possible. Otherwise, the friendly relations between China and Britain will inevitably be affected by the old scars of Hong Kong remaining in place. Dr. Gu Weijun, our country's ambassador to Britain, recently flew back to his post in Britain. During his trip, he gave an interview to the press, which touched on the Hong Kong issue. He said, "The time for formal negotiations has not yet arrived, but based on the interests of both China and Britain, we can confidently believe that a reasonable solution must be reached in the near future." Although Ambassador Gu's diplomatic language is extremely vague and unspecific, it can be seen from his words that Hong Kong should be returned to our country immediately. With the return of Hong Kong, not only will incidents like the *National Daily* not happen again, but the entire friendship between China and Britain can also be lifted from behind an old curtain.

Hong Kong was originally Chinese territory. A hundred years ago, it was ceded to Britain due to the Opium War and has been under British rule ever since. However, the island's residents, our compatriots, still account for 80% of the population. The cession of Hong Kong is certainly a humiliation for China, but is it not also a humiliation for Britain? Is it reasonable for a major power to use force to sell opium and then force the signing of a treaty under duress, ceding territory for the sake of opium? The entire world is changing, and the times are moving forward. There is no time to quickly erase such shameful remnants. How can we continue to occupy it? During the war, at the Cairo Conference, the three great powers of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek jointly discussed the long-term plan for the Far East, and in principle, they unanimously agreed to return Hong Kong to China, which is the principle of "returning things to their original owner." The colonial British authorities should also change their mindset. After the victory of the war, although the international situation was turbulent, and the peace treaty had not been signed, coupled with the many domestic troubles in our country, we were unable to take care of everything, and the Hong Kong issue was thus put on hold. However, during this transitional period, the Hong Kong authorities should follow the times, change their perspective, respect the will of the local people, and not go against the national aspirations of our country, turning to perverse acts that arouse the anger of the Chinese people. Taking the *National Daily* incident as an example, China's elimination of traitors is like Britain's elimination of British traitors, which is a wise measure that any country should take to rectify discipline and uphold justice. All allies should assist each other in completing the task. Now, the Hong Kong authorities cannot understand our country's national policy and instead want to protect traitors, considering it slander and ordering the suspension of publication. This not only violates the principles of democracy and freedom but also damages the friendship between China and Britain. We cannot but express our protest against this, and our government should, in particular, promptly lodge a serious protest with the British authorities through diplomatic channels until the goal is achieved. "Hoarfrost accumulates and then comes ice." Any event has its origins. We should still trace this matter back to the issue of the return of Hong Kong.

Our view of this matter is not based on emotional impulses, and we advocate that the government should also remain relatively calm. Because we believe that the actions of the Hong Kong government this time are not a sign of the restoration of the old British Far East policy. The inside story may be simply that the Hong Kong government was deceived by the traitor Cen Weixiu, resulting in this absurd measure. Why do we say this? The British Labour Cabinet, considering the overall global situation and carefully examining the domestic political situation, deeply knows that Britain's foreign policy, especially its colonial policy, needs to be changed. Therefore, the British Cabinet has successively announced that Britain will withdraw its troops from Egypt and recognize India's independence. These have all been well-received by world opinion. Given this, the British government feels that Hong Kong, which is thousands of miles away, is beyond its reach, and the British Labour Party, which is exceptionally intelligent, would not want to cling to this island, refuse to return it to China, and permanently leave an old scar of aggression from the most infamous Opium War in British imperial history. The new British ambassador to China, Stevenson, said in London: "Britain has no ambitions in China other than commerce and sincerely hopes that China will become a strong, stable, and unified country, undertaking important tasks in the United Nations to maintain world peace." Even if we cannot overestimate Ambassador Stevenson's general remarks, frankly speaking, considering the current international situation, what else does Britain need to ask for in the Far East besides restoring its commerce? Instead of occupying a small island for a long time, why not gain the sincere cooperation of a large country with 400 million people? Otherwise, it would only show the short-sightedness of British diplomats, and Labour Party figures would not be so stubborn. Therefore, we believe that the *National Daily* incident is simply that the outdated minds of the British colonial officials have not yet changed, and we cannot believe that the British Labour Cabinet's Far East policy has not shed the style of Conservative Party figures.

However, our country's diplomatic authorities should fight for what should be fought for in such incidents and must not simply yield. Seeing the big picture from the small, preventing problems before they arise, we should immediately submit protests to the British authorities and correct the mistakes of the Hong Kong government. In particular, what our diplomatic authorities should pay attention to is that once the time is ripe, they should conduct negotiations with the British authorities to seek a reasonable solution to the issue of the return of Hong Kong. As long as the Hong Kong issue is not resolved, the friendship between the people of China and Britain will have flaws, which is a shame in Chinese history and a shame in British history!

### Molotov Has Changed His Attitude, The Foreign Ministers' Conference Is Moving Towards Brightness, Most of the Economic Problems with Italy Have Been Resolved

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] The four-power foreign ministers' conference convened at 4 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) and adjourned at 7:30 PM, consistently permeated by a spirit of friendly compromise. Diplomatic circles have expressed satisfaction with the results obtained at today's meeting and the spirit embraced by the four foreign ministers when discussing the issues.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] The four-power foreign ministers' conference today, in an atmosphere of hope, again attempted to save Europe and the world from falling into a stalemate of confrontation between two major camps. Of the seven suggestions regarding the economic aspects of the draft Italian peace treaty, four have been agreed upon, with the remaining three to be discussed on Tuesday. The four suggestions that have been agreed upon are as follows: (1) Compensation for the losses suffered by United Nations property in Italy; (2) The issue of Italian property within the United Nations; (3) Italy's abandonment of claims against the United Nations; (4) General economic matters regarding commerce. The issue of compensation and the issue of Italian property within protected areas will be discussed again tomorrow. The four powers adopted Molotov's suggestion today to first discuss the economic clauses in the Italian treaty, which the Italian government considers to be an extremely friendly gesture from the Soviet Union. Molotov requested that the discussion of the political situation in Italy be added to the agenda, which the Italian side believes is merely a request for information and not an intention of the Soviet Union to interfere in Italy's internal affairs. Previously, the Soviet Union had stated that it would refuse to discuss the economic clauses of the Italian treaty until the Soviet Union's request for compensation of 300 million yuan was resolved. It was not until last week that it changed this attitude.

[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] The four-power foreign ministers' conference decided today that Italy shall have equal speaking rights in the International Court of Compensation regarding the issue of compensation arising from military actions within Italy. According to the U.S. side, some economic problems in the draft Italian peace treaty have been resolved. The foreign ministers also agreed to a U.S. suggestion to compensate the peoples of the United Nations with Italian property held by the United Nations. The conference also passed a clause stipulating that Italy abandon claims against the United Nations for losses suffered during the war.

[Another dispatch] The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union discussed the amount of Italian reparations today. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France are about to reach a compromise on this issue. At the meeting on the 16th of this month, when discussing economic issues related to the Italian peace treaty, the Soviet attitude was clearly more generous, thus arousing hope that the compensation issue could be resolved.

Italian Clauses Concerning Our Country in the Draft Italian Peace Treaty

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] It is learned here that if the draft Italian peace treaty submitted by the representatives of the four-power foreign ministers to the foreign ministers' conference today is adopted, Italy's post-war relationship with China will stand on the same line as that of the four European allied nations. It is reported that the clauses related to China that the four powers have agreed upon are as follows: (1) Italy abandons all rights and interests in China stipulated in the Beijing Agreement of 1901; (2) The Italian concession in Tianjin is abolished; (3) Italy abandons all rights and interests in the Shanghai and Xiamen public concessions.

### Being Pro-Soviet and Pro-British Are Not Helpful for Peace, Americans Must Be Pro-United Nations, Wallace Delivers a Speech to the Veterans' Association

[U.S. Information Service, Des Moines, Iowa, 17th] The U.S. Veterans' Committee held its first constitutional convention. Commerce Secretary Wallace delivered a speech on the eve of the convention, saying in brief: The world in which we currently find ourselves is organized in an extremely complex manner. Being pro-British and pro-Soviet cannot bring us lasting peace. If we seek security as progressive elements, we must be pro-United Nations. If we need to accomplish any task, then this task must be a task of the great nation, neither profiting from it nor wanting to be controlled by any group. What we want to strive for in this world is what we want to strive for domestically. At home, we are eager to obtain security and abundance in all units of social and economic life, and in the world, we seek the same thing. What we want to strive for is a simple solution to world problems. Those of you present, having fought alongside our allies, should be able to understand the true meaning of this. People around the world are tired of war. In every corner, people are working hard to pursue peace. If we work tirelessly, this peace can be achieved.

### Will the US and USSR Go to War? Not While Stalin Keeps His Mustache

[United Press, New York, 17th] A reporter who lived in the Soviet Union for five years, and has just returned to the United States, is often asked, is there a possibility of war between the United States and the Soviet Union? This question has surprised me. A young man, recently discharged from the army, asked me: "Should I re-enlist?" He said to me: "You lived in the Soviet Union for a long time, please tell me if the Soviet Union is preparing to fight us!" Middle-aged businessmen, social women, housewives, workers, police, and drivers all ask me the same question. I have been away from the United States for more than six years, and it is difficult for me to understand how such a question and idea as going to war with the Soviet Union could be seen as so important.

I lived in the Soviet Union for five years, and I talked at length every day with diplomatic figures in Moscow who had contact with the Soviet leaders. My wife is also Russian, so I cannot say that I do not understand the situation in the Soviet Union, nor can I say that I have no understanding of the attitude of the Soviet people. But in my view, as long as the clock on the Kremlin still has a face, and as long as Stalin still has his mustache, the Soviet Union will not want to fight with anyone.

Besides the fact that the Soviet leaders and people do not want to fight, there are also the following reasons that are worthy of American consideration: For example, the Soviet Union was greatly wounded during the war with Germany, losing many men and women, machines and livestock. Although the Soviet Union's coal, iron, and electrical industries are recovering rapidly, the situation is still very bad. Also, according to those familiar with the development of atomic energy, the Soviet Union's research on atomic energy is far behind that of Britain and the United States. In addition, the Soviet people are already very tired and unable to fight. In fact, even if they were capable, they would not fight, because the Soviet people have not been a warlike nation in the past. The Soviet Air Force is also small compared to the United States or Britain, and the Navy cannot compete with other Allied countries. Moreover, the Soviet leaders are actively promoting their Five-Year Plan. The Soviet people seem to yearn for peace and pray for peace. Where would they want to fight?

However, where does the talk of war come from? A large part of the reason is because the Soviet Union cannot deeply understand the psychology of the Anglo-Saxons. In addition, the methods the Soviet Union takes to implement its policies are also a major reason.

### Japanese War Criminals Show No Remorse, Tojo Still Quibbles and Blames Pre-War Policies of Britain and the United States, Concealing Aggression and Falsely Claiming Self-Defense

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Japanese war criminal Tojo has submitted a defense statement to the United Press, refuting the prosecutors' accusations to Tojo and the other 27 defendants at the International Tribunal, saying that the prosecution failed to prove that the defendants had a conspiracy to dominate the world. It is claimed that the Pacific War can be traced back to the early 1920s, and that "Britain and the United States tricked Japan into getting involved in a war against civilization, destroying civilization, and the responsibility lies with Britain and the United States." This statement is a combination of propaganda and theory, with a slight sting, and is Tojo's first detailed account of the causes of the Pacific War. The reasons for the war listed by Tojo are as follows: (1) The Anglo-American group oppressed Japan after the First European War; (2) Some major powers opposed East Asian immigration, adopted discriminatory tariff policies, and formed economic groups to prohibit the development of Japanese trade; (3) Racial discrimination; (4) Before the "Greater East Asia War," Britain and the United States jointly imposed an economic blockade on Japan and exerted military and economic threats on Japan; (5) Adopting a policy that prompted China to continue resisting and to cause a Sino-Japanese war; (6) In the final stage of the Japanese-American negotiations, proposing impossible suggestions to Japan.

Tojo mentioned racial discrimination and immigration restrictions, bringing up the old issue of the Immigration Act of 1924, saying that some Japanese people were already talking about war at that time, and that years later, the Japanese military used this as part of its propaganda campaign. Tojo claimed that the above reasons show that Japan was forced into a war of self-defense to "ensure its integrity and establish the permanent survival of the people of East Asia. This view should not be dismissed as the voice of a defeated country." Tojo's defense statement did not mention the cause of the Chinese Incident as the root of the Pacific War. All this proves that the fundamental beliefs of the stubborn Japanese militarists regarding the actions that nearly destroyed Japan have not changed in either belief or theory. Tojo continued that the prosecution's accusation that Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor was an act of destroying conditions and slaughter was a "serious mistake." Regarding barbaric acts, even if the violation of war regulations and customs is left to be judged in the future, Japan is still a civilized country. On the other hand, the enemy's slaughter of wounded soldiers on the battlefield, the bombing of hospital ships, the bombing of undefended civilians, and finally the dropping of atomic bombs, are obvious violations of treaties and planned collective massacres. If one only recognizes this kind of behavior as a natural step in maintaining civilization, one cannot acknowledge that one's attitude is fair. The original intention of concluding the Tripartite Pact was not to control the world, but to "enable all countries in the world to get what they deserve, in order to achieve permanent peace." He was unaware of the secret military clauses in the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact. Military training in Japanese schools before the war "is not a problem." If a military training is used as spiritual education in a school of an independent country, it is by no means a reason to suggest that it is the beginning of implementing an aggressive plan. Moreover, "I have heard that this system was modeled after the United States," he said. This point was also raised in court this morning, which may indicate that the views of the defendants and Tojo are very similar.

### Japan's Militaristic Education of Youth, Sea Village's Testimony Does Not Match Expectations

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] The Far East International Tribunal continued to hear the case of the Japanese war criminal Tojo and 28 others today. The defendant's defense lawyer accused American students of having implemented military training in the same year as the Pearl Harbor incident, countering the prosecution's accusations against each defendant for engaging in war preparations in schools across Japan. On the prosecution side, the Japanese witness Professor Kaigo, a professor of educational history at Tokyo Imperial University, testified in court. First, the defendant's lawyer Hara expressed a lengthy defense based on his own opinion, and then asked the witness to express his opinion. Kaigo then said to Hara, "I also agree with your intention that military training in schools is a peaceful step to shorten training." The prosecution originally expected Kaigo to prove that the culprits who launched the war in Japan used schools across the country to incite aggressive madness in young people. Unexpectedly, Kaigo's reply did not match the original expectations, so they told the court that Kaigo was "not responsible" and held a "hostile attitude." Assistant Prosecutor Hammack also asked the court to allow him to refute Kaigo's words, but ultimately withdrew this request. Kaigo said in his statement: Japan intensified military training in 1925 and 1926 because "Japanese society was quite unstable after the First World War, and the implementation of military training was able to curb this trend." All Japanese students must undergo two years of compulsory military training so that after graduation, they only need to undergo another year and a half of training. This is a peaceful step to shorten the training period. After the Manchurian Incident, military training was intensified, and as a result, it "had a considerable impact on Japan's actions." Japanese schools implemented "Japan First" education, which was very effective in middle and high schools. Students' thinking can be divided into two types: one believes that Japan's policies since the Manchurian Incident and the concept of "Japan First" are all correct and without error, and the other believes that Japan's policies since the Manchurian Incident are extremely dangerous. "Japan First" education had no far-reaching impact on students from the northern provinces.

### Powell and Others Arrive in Japan, Will Be Important Witnesses

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] J.B. Powell, former editor of the China Weekly Review, arrived here today from New York and will attend the Far East International Tribunal as an important witness for the prosecution. It is reported that Powell was detained by the Japanese at the Hongkou Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Shanghai after the outbreak of the Pacific War. In the severe winter cold, with thin clothing and bedding, both feet developed gangrene and were not treated properly. After being released back to the United States in 1942, he had to undergo surgery to amputate both feet and was hospitalized for two years.

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] Three American witnesses who "witnessed" the Japanese military's aggression arrived in Tokyo last night from the United States to testify at the war crimes trial. The names of the three are as follows: (1) J.B. Powell, editor of the China Review Weekly in Shanghai, (2) Dr. Wilson, who witnessed the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese army in 1937 and served as a doctor, (3) Reverend Magee, who witnessed the fall of Nanjing and is now at Nanking University. Wilson took film footage of the actions of the Japanese army in Nanjing and plans to submit it as evidence at the trial.

### The Inside Story of Kurusu's Mission to Washington Revealed

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Chief Prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal, Keenan, returned to the country on official business and told reporters here today: Saburo Kurusu, the "peace envoy" sent by Japan to the United States before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, had talked to him about the inside story of his mission to the United States. He said that before he was sent to the United States in the winter of 1941, Tojo had personally asked him to ask the United States for three things as conditions for preventing the Pacific War, namely (1) unfreezing Japanese funds in the United States; (2) transporting high-octane gasoline to Japan in the quantities requested; and (3) prohibiting the supply of gasoline to China. In exchange, Japan agreed to withdraw Japanese troops from Vietnam. After Kurusu arrived in Washington, the Japanese Cabinet changed its instructions again, only allowing the withdrawal of troops from southern Japan. Keenan did not specify whether these conditions were presented to the United States. Keenan also said that after the end of the war, Tojo had told Kurusu that if the Japanese government had not interfered with the urgent telegram sent by US President Roosevelt to Japanese Emperor Hirohito, Japan could have avoided war with the United States, and that it was too late to regret it now. Keenan also said that Kurusu, while in Washington, had telegraphed Japanese Minister of the Imperial Household Kido, asking him to present President Roosevelt's telegram to the Japanese Emperor, but it was blocked by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### The Japanese Emperor is Clearly a Puppet, Why Make Him Stand Trial?

When asked whether Hirohito would also be tried as a war criminal, Keenan replied that, judging from the various evidence collected, the Japanese Emperor was clearly a tool of the Japanese military clique who held the emperor hostage to command the princes, and that it would be a mistake to make him stand trial.

### The "Left" and "Right" of American Foreign Policy (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing

The tendency for the Democratic Party in the United States to split became apparent after Roosevelt's death. At Roosevelt's first White House press conference after taking office as President for the fourth term, a reporter from the New York Times asked him: "President, during these four years, will your domestic and foreign policies be to the left or to the right?" Roosevelt very frankly replied to him: his policies and positions have always been in the middle and leaning to the left, and in the fourth term as president, he would be a little more to the left than in the third term.

However, not long after, President Roosevelt died. We cannot say that the current Truman has completely turned to the right, but the figures in another circle around Truman are waving the banner of Democratic Party "orthodoxy," and the political views and reputations of these people are indeed much further to the left than Mr. Truman's.

### Wallace Criticizes the Government

On Labor Day, May 1, the group led by Mr. Wallace held a meeting at the Commodore Hotel. I heard Mr. Wallace's impassioned speech. He criticized the current government's domestic and foreign policies. He said that the Democratic Party's foreign policy should not be centered on anti-Sovietism, and the Democratic Party's domestic policy should not be to protect the declining capitalism. On another evening in late May, the New York State Labor Association held its annual meeting and dinner. Wallace gave a public lecture on "National Socialism," saying: The economic and social system of the United States has reached its end. A wise Democratic government should gradually push this economic system to national socialism. He also said that superficial and palliative measures to solve the strike wave are not enough to solve the ills of the American economic system. But from beginning to end, he did not mention that the state should take over private enterprises.

That night, there were more than 2,000 members and non-members listening to Wallace's speech. The figures in the New York State Labor Association applauded and cheered enthusiastically. It seems that they have a fervent admiration for Wallace personally. But, most importantly, Wallace said in the last section of his speech: The two-party system is the best system for democratic politics, "So, I (Wallace refers to himself) do not want to organize a third party, nor do I want others to persuade me to organize a third major party." According to the reasons Wallace himself elaborated, it is: "Organizing a third party will only weaken the progressive forces and give an advantage to the reactionary, stubborn, and conservative groups."

The implication of this passage is very thought-provoking. If the Democratic Party splits, it will only give the Republican Party an advantage? I don't know if that's what Mr. Wallace meant. If this assumption can be established, then it means that some people within the Democratic Party have already encouraged Wallace to form a new party and declare a separation from the current government. Wallace does not want to "separate," which means that if he hopes that his political views can be implemented, he can only wait for the next party election.

There are two possible ways to win a party contest: one is to win with political views, and the other is to win with organization. The most powerful person currently manipulating the Democratic Party's organization is undoubtedly Postmaster General Hannegan. I have never met Hannegan. In the photos, he is a man of burly stature and dignified appearance. I know that for each of Wallace's gatherings and public speeches, he wrote a letter inviting Mr. Hannegan to attend, but this central figure of the party has never been to the Commodore Hotel. On the anniversary of Roosevelt's death, President Truman and Hannegan and a large group visited Mrs. Roosevelt at Hyde Park early in the morning, and laid flowers on the grave. In the evening, Mrs. Roosevelt rushed to New York to attend the commemorative meeting called by Wallace. Truman and Hannegan returned to Washington, and Hannegan sent a deputy in party affairs to represent him at Wallace's meeting.

Conversely, during President Truman's every trip or tour, Hannegan is always "inseparable." President Truman went to the seaside to inspect the newly completed battleship, and Hannegan was present when he went fishing by the sea. When Chief Justice (President) Stone of the Supreme Court passed away in old age, newspapers all over the United States speculated about possible successors. However, President Truman's first call to discuss the successor was with this Postmaster General Hannegan. (Editor's note: Truman has recommended Secretary of the Treasury Vinson as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on June 6)

### Secretary of State in the Spotlight

I don't know on what grounds, when the news of Stone's death was sent from Washington to New York, many people in the New York press said that Byrnes was going to change, saying that there was already a deep ideological gap between the President and the Secretary of State, and that Byrnes's most likely and most appropriate retreat was to succeed the old Stone in that role, and be appointed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as a "promotion in name but demotion in reality." When Byrnes was in Paris for a meeting (referring to the last Paris Foreign Ministers Conference), American reporters even chased after him to ask him about it, leaving the authorities unsure how to answer.

I have put in effort to pay attention to this issue, but I have never discovered where the "gap" between the President and the Secretary of State lies? The only possible speculation is that Byrnes's diplomatic style is still the old American style of the past. This set may have been very suitable for Americans to hear before the First World War or before the Pearl Harbor Incident, but now the United States is the leading country in the world. Former President Roosevelt has already laid the foundation for the leadership position of the United States. American intellectuals generally feel that Byrnes's hoarse broadcasting is not weighty enough, especially that he has no way to deal with the Soviet Union's strong and overbearing nature. In this issue of Life magazine (June 3), there is an article tens of thousands of words long entitled "On Soviet Foreign Policy," written by Foster Dulles, the grandson of Secretary of State Old Foster in the late 19th century. He used to be a "foreign advisor" to the Chinese delegation to the Hague Peace Conference, and later mixed in the American diplomatic circles for decades. Now he is the Deputy Representative of the United States to the United Nations Conference. He is very dissatisfied with the current Byrnes diplomacy. Although his article is written very objectively, he repeatedly pointed out: "American diplomacy should minimize conflicts with the Soviet Union"; "Hatred, confrontation, and preparation for war are not diplomacy, and are not the direction that diplomats should strive for." Therefore, he said: "If Americans can understand the Soviet Union a little more, then conflicts with the Soviet Union can be reduced by a fraction." (To be continued)

### Major Car Crash Tragedy at Zhenru Station: Reckless Driving of a Ten-Wheeled Truck Causes Disaster; Truck and Train Simultaneously Catch Fire and Burn; 41 Dead and Injured, Heavy Losses

[Report from this newspaper] At 5:32 AM yesterday, at the railroad crossing in front of the main entrance of Jinan University at Zhenru Train Station, a large ten-wheeled truck, fully loaded with matches, collided with Express Train No. 7, coming from Nanjing to Shanghai, resulting in a massive explosion and burning tragedy. The result was four deaths and thirty-seven injuries. Both the truck and four train cars were completely burned. The truck driver, Shi Hanzhang, the owner, Sheng Guohong, and the worker, Rong Ahai, were burned beyond recognition; their bodies were unidentifiable, a horrific sight. The train driver, stoker, and passengers were either burned or injured from jumping off the train. Among them, a train guard, Zhang Yunsheng, suffered burns all over his body and was rushed to the railway hospital but died within ten minutes. Another driver, He Awu, 46 years old, suffered burns to his face and hands. Stoker He Hezhang, 29 years old, suffered burns to his face and legs. Stoker Peng Zhicheng, 23 years old, suffered burns to his face and both arms. All are currently hospitalized at the railway hospital for treatment.

Injured passengers included Chen Chunrong, 40 years old, with a fractured lower leg; Qiu Shi, 36 years old, female, with burns to her face; Wei Yuankang, 14 years old, with burns to his hands and face; Chen Zhenxin, 25 years old, suffering from concussion; Wei Wenyuan, 36 years old, with burns to his arm. The above were hospitalized due to the severity of their injuries but are not in life-threatening condition. Zhou Baisheng, 48 years old, with a fractured lower leg, received emergency treatment and was discharged to recover at home.

Other passengers, including Ge Huarong, Ye Guanru, Chen Zheng, Lan Juren, Lan Juxing, Zhang Yilong, Yu Ruming, Wei Yinkang, Shao Yuming, Bao Lu, Zhang Tongshun, Li Jintang, Zhang Huipu, Wang Xun, Yang Jialin, Liu Jiaxin, Yan Youqing, Han Fengtian, Zhu Shixiong, Hu Jiaqian, Chen Di Shi, He Junnian, Zhou Jin'yi, He You, Lu Zhenquan, Zhang Acai, Zhang Jincai, and Lian Xun, suffered minor injuries, received first aid and bandaging, and were sent home by car.

The incident occurred yesterday when the northbound slow train No. 523 departed from the North Station around 5:00 AM. More than twenty minutes later, it arrived at Zhenru Station and stopped at the crossing to allow the train from Beijing to pass. At this time, Express Train No. 7 arrived quickly. Just as the trains were passing each other, a large ten-wheeled jeep (license plate number Shanghai National 36074) belonging to Wanfeng Maritime Transportation Company (No. 171, Minhang Road), whose owner is Zhang Kang from Ningbo, fully loaded with thirty boxes of Guohua brand matches produced by the Guohua Match Factory on Huayi Street in the South Market, was traveling from Shanghai to Suzhou. When it arrived at the railroad crossing at Fuxing Road at Zhenru Station, the driver, Shi Hanzhang (38 years old, from Pudong), in his haste to cross, engaged the gears and charged forward, colliding with the locomotive of Express Train No. 7. After being thrown off, it then crashed into the locomotive of slow train No. 52, which was meeting at the station, and overturned, the car rolling under the train car of train No. 7, causing a major disaster.

Because the jeep was on a long-distance trip, it was carrying a large amount of gasoline, as well as a large number of matches, all of which were flammable and explosive. Once ignited, the fire became uncontrollable. The flames blazed, and thick black smoke filled the air. The jeep was completely burned, and the driver, Shi Hanzhang, the owner, Sheng Guohong (32 years old, from Anhui), and the worker, Rong Ahai (27 years old, from Tongzhou), all perished in the flames. The train guard, Zhang Rongsheng (22 years old, from Nanxiang), suffered burns all over his body and died within ten minutes after being sent to the hospital. When the fire spread, it also engulfed four cars of Express Train No. 7, including the first-class cars No. 659 and 613, the dining car, and the second-class car No. 716 and 681. At that time, Feng Xiqing, the stationmaster of Zhenru Station, immediately led all station staff to rush to the rescue, and the eight cars in the rear were detached, thus avoiding disaster.

The passengers on the train were in great chaos at the time. In their rush to escape, many men and women passengers were burned or injured from falls, numbering as many as thirty-seven. Many were unable to retrieve their luggage and packages. It was said that an employee of a certain bank in Suzhou was carrying 30 to 40 million yuan in legal tender but was unable to take it with him, and it was all destroyed in the fire. When the accident occurred, Zhenru Station telegraphed an emergency message to the North Station. Deputy Director Yu Hua, Chief of the Engineering Department, Mei, and Deputy Directors of the Transportation Department, Wu Guan, as well as Ouyang Zhi, Chief of the Xihu Transportation Section, all went to the scene to direct the operation. Afterwards, the Transportation Department dispatched six trucks to Zhenru to pick up the passengers of the express train from Beijing to Shanghai. At the same time, the railway bureau's factory affairs, transportation, and engineering departments mobilized more than a hundred people to rush to work.

After receiving the report, the railway hospital dispatched two mobile clinics stationed at the station to rush to the rescue. At the same time, ambulances from the Central Fire Department also arrived to transport the injured to Shanghai. The fire was extinguished by fire trucks from Zhabei and Zhenru at 7:00 AM. After the railway bureau's workers hurriedly cleared the debris, traffic resumed as usual after a delay of two to three hours. Only the remains of the jeep were left. The driver's body was still in the car, but only half of his head and a charred section of his body remained. It was inside.

According to the Railway Bureau, the loss of the four train cars and the damage to the rails and sleepers caused by the fire is unprecedented. The exact amount of damage is difficult to estimate at this time. Considering only the dining car, the interior decoration was extremely luxurious, and the chairs and compartments were all made of wood. The cushions were also made of silk, so the loss is already substantial. Zhang Kang, the owner, has now been detained by the judicial section of the Railway Bureau's police department for questioning.

### Xia Qifeng: The Old-Line Traitor's Dream Has Not Awoken; Shamelessly Talks About the Past; Deeply Regrets Not Having Become a Central Figure?

A "three-dynasty veteran" who once served as "Minister of Audit," he is very senior. But when Judge Qiu asked him what he did during his tenure as "Minister of Audit," he said shamefacedly, "It's just an empty title, just an empty title. I still don't understand auditing law to this day!" His flustered and ugly appearance could not help but elicit light laughter from the audience. As for the so-called "Ministry of Foreign Affairs," "Humph! Ha!" He frowned and said bitterly, "It's just supporting fifty or sixty outdated diplomats who have nothing to do but eat idly." But Xia Qifeng himself does not admit that he is outdated, at least he has an explanation for his "outdatedness": because he was unable to curry favor. He said, "When I was the Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Joint Committee of the Chinese Government in Beiping, I only managed the proposed documents for a year. If I could run around and make connections, I would definitely have become the center of the situation, and I would never have been willing to be such a small official." This greatly buried his "traitorous talent," and he still feels very sorry to this day! His dream has not completely awoken.

### Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the Puppet Police Bureau: With a Face Full of Ferocious Flesh, Chest Thrust Out and Belly Protruding, Vehemently Denies Root of Tree Massacre of Patriots

[Another report] Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was re-examined by Judge Xiao yesterday afternoon. Su wore a light gray long gown and yellow-rimmed glasses, with a face full of ferocious flesh. When answering questions, he thrust out his chest and protruded his belly, as if he were in Although it has been more than half a year, the prestige of the puppet police chief has not been lost? However, he vehemently denied the massacre of patriotic martyrs during his tenure as a puppet official, and being the mastermind of the Nanjing killing field "Big Tree Root." The court immediately subpoenaed Shen Fenggang, who said: 35 years old, he organized the China Youth Iron Blood Anti-Japanese Traitor Elimination Group in 1939 and served as its leader. He was arrested by Su's department and escorted to Nanjing with Zhang Xiaotong. At that time, Su was the district chief in the Nanjing District of the Puppet Secret Service Headquarters and still vividly remembers the persecution of Zhang Xiaotong. However, Shen then complained a lot, saying that he used to risk his life doing underground work, but now he is being held in a Shanghai prison. (Shen was also prosecuted by the High Procuratorate for turning traitor afterwards, hence the statement.) He was immediately stopped by the court. After strict questioning, he was ordered to be returned to custody and the hearing was rescheduled.

### Two More Members of the German Fifth Column in North China Arrested: Still Working with the Japanese After Germany Surrendered: Arrested by the U.S. Military Authorities and to Be Sent to Shanghai for Trial

[Report from this newspaper] According to the U.S. Army Headquarters in China, two German intelligence personnel in China have now been arrested. One is Volker Lock and the other is Hayeshek. After the German army surrendered in Europe, they still helped the Japanese enemy in the North China Intelligence Headquarters to carry out espionage work against the United States and China. Fukuoka was originally an employee of a German company and once served as a professor. It is said that he will be brought to Shanghai soon and temporarily detained in the Huade Road prison for interrogation. Also, some Germans previously detained by the Chinese military authorities in Guangzhou will also be airlifted to Shanghai for questioning by the US military authorities. It is reported that the German intelligence network is very wide, extending from Beiping deep into the Northeast, Mongolia, Yan'an, and Chongqing. Its Beiping Intelligence Headquarters also hired radio operators to specialize in disrupting the military movements of the Allied forces. According to the Japanese intelligence chief, the main tasks of the German Intelligence Department in North China were: (1) to collect all information on the US military's landing in China; (2) to report on Chongqing's political and military; (3) to report on Yan'an's political and military intentions; (4) to report on the progress of US-Soviet relations, the US-Soviet supply line, the US-Soviet airlift, and landing traffic conditions, and the military trends of the US and the Soviet Union. In addition to the above four main espionage tasks, it also provided the following information to Japan: (1) how the US Air Force controls the Japanese army in North China; (2) the movements of the US fleet; (3) intelligence on the relationship between Chongqing and Yan'an; (4) intelligence on the supply of Chinese troops from Xi'an; (5) intelligence on the supply of free zones from the Lanzhou area in the Northwest.

In addition, the German Intelligence Department supplied Japan with information on the movements of the U.S. Air Force and China National Aviation Corporation in Shanghai and other parts of China, including the routes, troops, guerrillas, and aviation teams that the U.S. Air Force and China National Aviation Corporation used to supply China.

Since December 1942, the highest German intelligence official in the Far East has been appointed by A. The name was changed to. When working later, a separate alias was used. This person was famous for running espionage on the Balkan Peninsula. Initially, O performed the activities under the name of a sales representative of Kelly Company. At the same time as him, there were Rodelov of Zui Shi Foreign Firm, Heil of Feida Company. (Hai was originally a military advisor in Guangxi Province) Lachi of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, and Yullito, Xin Kai of the German News Agency, Li Qiu of Electrical Materials from Aikai Development Center, and Haiping Nieto of Burke Men Company, etc. German firms such as Siemens, Chansen Foreign Firm, and Lihe Foreign Firm also provided a large amount of economic assistance. This economic assistance was the main driving force for its work to proceed. Later, for the convenience of working for Ha, O was appointed as an important official by the German Ambassador. In addition, he used diplomatic personnel to do his best to contact the bureau. In name, he was a Nazi, but in fact, he was an important part of O'Hara's intelligence department.

### Hollywood Casino Boss: Bailed Out with 4 Million in Cash

### Those Who Occupy and Transfer Ownership Will Be Severely Punished: Resolution of the Housing Allocation Committee: Those Who Receive the Transfer Will Be Ordered to Move Out

Cultural and Other Institutions Will Not Be Discussed for the Time Being: Staff of the Disposal Bureau Do Not Need to Be Allocated Housing Again

[Report from this newspaper] The Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan for various Shanghai institutions held a committee meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved: (1) The order of housing allocation will be based on the importance of each institution. (2) If Japanese-occupied houses are forcibly occupied and it is found that gold bars have been collected to transfer ownership to others, they will be severely punished according to law. Those who receive the transferred rent will be ordered to move out within a time limit. (3) If an institution applying for housing allocation is found to have occupied more than 50% of the number of houses approved by the association, the allocation will be suspended. If the applicants do not report the detailed number of returnees, etc., they must re-report before the 20th, otherwise they will not be allocated. The issue of housing allocation for cultural and other institutions will not be discussed for the time being. (4) The number of houses allocated to each institution will be calculated by multiplying the number of returnees in each institution by three times [that is, one person is stipulated to be accompanied by two family members], with two-story houses accommodating six people and three-story houses accommodating ten people as the standard. Because there are not enough houses to allocate at present, only 20% will be allocated temporarily. For example: an institution with 100 personnel should be allocated 30 three-story houses according to three times the calculation, but currently only six houses will be allocated first, and the internal distribution will be handled by each institution.

The committee's allocation and execution work are now being actively carried out, and the investigation work is expected to be completed by the end of this month.

It is also learned that Liu Gongyun, Director of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau, specifically stated when attending the committee yesterday that the staff dormitory of the Disposal Bureau currently has more than 50 houses, all of which have signed leases, and the Housing Allocation Committee does not need to allocate any more houses. The staff dormitory of the Central Trust Bureau is currently occupied by more than 50 houses, and the rest have signed leases but have not moved in.

### Security Department: Five Criminals Executed by Firing Squad, Including Gu Gengsheng, Who Impersonated Rong Youlue to Swindle Money from Wang Xiaolai

### Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau Discovers 30 Billion in Materials; Investigation Agency to Conclude at the End of the Month

The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has largely completed its takeover work. Disputes over property rights have long ceased to be accepted. Now that the investigation work is nearing completion, it has been decided that the Bureau's investigation team and all its offices in various locations will be closed down at the end of this month. A total of over 30 billion in materials has been discovered, of which 1.3 billion has already been auctioned, 5 billion has not yet been auctioned, 16 billion represents the value of real estate, and 8 billion has been transferred to other agencies for handling.

### The Scenery Along the Suzhou Creek is Beautiful; The Water Dwellers are Happy and Carefree; Unaware of the Threat of Cholera! Smiling and Asking Why Need to Learn Embroidery?

The newly appointed Director of the Health Bureau, Zhang Wei, has solemnly warned Shanghai citizens: "The cholera epidemic is spreading rampantly. The Suzhou Creek has been contaminated. Citizens must not drink raw water!"

The Suzhou Creek! This "breeding ground" for cholera! As the bustling crowds come and go on the Bund Bridge, looking at the muddy water in the river, where households of all sizes float, no one can help but secretly feel uneasy for them!

The once prominent China Park is now a desolate wasteland. In order to understand the general situation of ordinary boat dwellers, the reporter made a special trip across the rubble field covered with feces and urine, and walked towards the bank of the Suzhou Creek, and had a brief conversation with a boat woman who was chopping firewood. I am grateful for her frank narration, which gave the reporter a rough outline of the life of these water dwellers.

Salvage and Diving

The boat dwellers along the Bund Bridge are called the "Salvage and Diving" group. Their task is to specialize in salvaging sunken objects from the bottom of the water. Whenever a ship capsizes, they immediately rush to the scene after receiving notification, put on leather suits, wear copper helmets, and dive into the water to salvage lost items. This is naturally a difficult and dangerous job, but thanks to years of accumulated experience, accidents rarely occur. The "Conte Verde" postal ship on the former Bund was able to float because more than 300 of them were mobilized to work for more than a month, salvaging the goods from the ship, closing the hatches tightly, so that the water could be pumped out and the hull slowly floated to the surface.

The reward for this type of work is based on the value of the salvaged goods. However, 20% of the profits must be returned to the "boss" - the owner of the salvage tools (leather suit, copper helmet, etc.) and the owner of the goods. On weekdays, they can barely make a living through hard work, especially after the victory, life is relatively easier because during the occupation, there were always many gangsters on the docks who arbitrarily extorted money, and this level of exploitation has completely disappeared after peace. Therefore, they all say: "Peace is ultimately good, and it's good to be a person in peaceful times."

Passed Down Through Generations

These people who live on boats all their lives have no connection with material civilization. They have been engaged in this industry for often more than ten generations. At least three or four people live on a boat, and the maximum is more than a dozen. Their daily life is extremely hardworking and enduring. Every day, they must save 20% of their income for ship repairs. Because every ordinary ship must be repaired twice in three years. And this repair cost is often very considerable, ranging from two to three million to tens of millions of dollars. Few of them marry outsiders (non-boat dwellers). Usually, before getting married, they must first try to accumulate a sum of money in order to purchase a new boat after marriage and start a new family.

They are accompanied by water for generations, born, grow up, get old, and die on the water. But from their tone, there seems to be no aversion at all. On the contrary, they love water very much. Children always love to soak in the water, and every child becomes a skilled swimmer by the age of ten. When the reporter asked them if accidents often occur, the middle-aged boat woman said, "Just this morning, a baby fell into the water, and the adults saw it and immediately rescued him." Her tone was so peaceful and calm that it was impossible to find any fear in it.

Seeds of Civilization

The seeds of civilization have recently begun to spread to them. Parents are willing to send their children to school, because their residence is relatively fixed, so children generally have the opportunity to study. When the reporter was talking, more than a dozen innocent black children cast surprised glances at the reporter, and several older children introduced their friends to the reporter: "This is Laurel, this is Hardy, this is Han Geng..."

Their understanding of scientific knowledge is too poor. When the reporter asked about the epidemic situation, most of them did not know the seriousness of cholera. After the reporter told them: "This year the epidemic is prevalent, and drinking river water is very dangerous," they replied: "That's not the case. We have been drinking this river water for generations, and we have never had any problems." According to the boat woman, the water in the Suzhou Creek can only be drawn and drunk during high tide (12:00 to 5:00). They store the water in jars at the beginning of each high tide and purify it with alum and raw ginger. "It's cleaner than tap water," they boasted in unison. The reporter looked at the river water that had settled in the jar, and it was indeed clear and green.

Fear of Doctors and Medicine

Usually, they eat more hot water, which is naturally safer. However, in this area where the mud is black, and mosquitoes and flies gather, children inevitably play in the water all day long, and it is difficult to avoid the risk of being invaded by epidemic bacteria. Most of them are afraid of doctors and medicine and refuse to get injections. Everyone says: "Why do you want to prick a needle on a good skin?"

I remember Director Zhang once said: "Disease enters through the mouth. Rich people have very little chance of getting cholera. What really needs to be prevented are those who are toiling masses!" After this visit, I felt that Director Zhang's words were correct. Publicizing the seriousness of the cholera epidemic to those toiling masses and compulsorily implementing preventive injections is really urgent because when the epidemic bacteria attack the world, they are the first to bear the brunt. If, due to inadequate prevention, the bacteria were to break into their positions, taking away one by one dark, strong, innocent, and lively children, that would be the most tragic tragedy in the world!

However, the delivery of custom-made tools is still pending. It is expected that well water disinfection will hopefully begin this weekend. Using DDT to kill flies may also be carried out in cholera-prone areas and restaurant kitchens in the middle of next week. As for killing mosquitoes and bedbugs, it is expected to begin at the end of this month because the purchase of sprayers is still pending.

### Aviation Construction Association Promotes Aeronautical Engineering Education

[Report from this city] In order to promote aviation education, the Political Department of the Aviation Commission will jointly hold an aviation model exhibition with the Shanghai China Aviation Model Research Association at the YMCA Auditorium on Sichuan Road for five days starting yesterday. The reporter made a special visit to the Shanghai branch of the China Aviation Construction Association yesterday to inquire about the association's efforts to inspire civil aviation in China. According to Chen Zhan, director of the finance department, the association's current main task is to recruit members, with a recruitment target of 300,000 people, which will end at the end of June. The only difficulty currently encountered is financial constraints. The association originally planned to build a parachute tower, but the materials had to come from the United States and the cost was huge, so it has not yet been decided. However, the association has entrusted its advisors, General Chennault and General Wedemeyer, to pay attention at all times in the United States in order to obtain materials at a low price. In addition, once the funding is sufficient, the association will also set up an aviation model agency and establish a model aircraft factory in the short term. Director Chen also said: At present, only Jiaotong University in Shanghai has an aeronautical engineering department (most of the professors are foreigners). The association has established close ties with the school and plans to enable every university to set up an aeronautical engineering department in the near future so that aviation and education can achieve mutual development. The Aviation Construction Association hopes to use Yiyuan as its venue and hopes that all sectors of society can provide financial assistance.

The number of books borrowed by those who make a living at sea reached as many as 6.5 million, surpassing the collection of the New York Public Library and its branches. The New York Times editorial continued: A town without books is a dull place, and a ship without books is even duller. Reading is the richest form of cultivation and one of the few pastimes that sailors at sea can enjoy. The number of books they read before and after duty is truly astonishing. For example, last year, the American Merchant Marine Library Association loaned 758,000 books and 1.5 million magazines, and even this number could not meet the demand. The association hopes to expand its onshore library services and deliver its collection to every remote American lighthouse and every American ship.

### Ministry of Education Adds Border Elementary Schools; Enrollment and Classes Scheduled for This Autumn

[Special Dispatch from Xichang by Our Newspaper] Considering that Tibet and Xikang are located on the border and their culture urgently needs to be improved, the Ministry of Education has established elementary schools directly under the jurisdiction of the border areas to improve cultural standards.

### Study of Elementary School Curriculum (9): Reduce Subjects and Teaching Time as Much as Possible to Suit Children's Physical and Mental Development

When revising elementary school curriculum standards, in accordance with the "Simplification" principle of the Ministry of Education, the "teaching subjects" and "teaching time" should be reduced as much as possible to suit children's physical and mental development. Now, based on personal opinions, an outline is formulated separately for reference by the authorities:

Teaching Subjects

According to the original standard promulgated in October of the 31st year of the Republic, the teaching subjects for lower and middle grades of elementary school were set as eight subjects: "Group Training," "Music," "Physical Education," "Chinese Language," "Arithmetic," "General Knowledge," "Drawing," and "Handicraft." Now it is planned to reduce the teaching subjects for lower grades to four subjects: (1) Life Training (including both moral education and hygiene habit training, which is to train children's entire life, so the original standard group training is changed to life training). (2) Chinese Language (including three parts: Chinese Language, General Knowledge, and Hygiene Knowledge, but the weight of each part should not be too heavy). (3) Singing and Playing (including two parts: Physical Education and Music). (4) Work (including two parts: Drawing and Handicraft). The teaching subjects for middle grades will also be appropriately reduced, and it is proposed to be revised to six subjects: in addition to the four subjects of "Life Training," "Chinese Language," "Singing and Playing," and "Work," two subjects of "General Knowledge" and "Arithmetic" will be added. As for the teaching subjects for upper grades of elementary school, the original standard set nine subjects: "Group Training," "Music," "Physical Education," "Chinese Language," "Arithmetic," "Social Studies," "Nature," "Drawing," and "Handicraft." It seems that it can remain the same without adding or subtracting, but the weight of each subject must be reduced as much as possible. "Group Training" is still changed to "Life Training." Some people advocate changing "Drawing" to "Fine Arts," but it is felt that it is not very appropriate. In order to adapt to children's comprehension ability, it seems appropriate to continue to use the original name "Drawing" for safety, because the two words "Fine Arts" are not easy for children to understand.

Teaching Time

The original standard stipulates the weekly teaching time for elementary school: 1,080 minutes for the first grade; 1,170 minutes for the second grade; 1,290 minutes for the third grade; 1,350 minutes for the fourth grade; and 1,500 minutes for the fifth and sixth grades. It is now proposed to revise it as follows: (calculated weekly) 720 minutes for lower grades, that is, an average of two hours per day; 1,080 minutes for middle grades, that is, an average of three hours per day; 1,440 minutes for upper grades, that is, an average of four hours per day. The teaching time for each grade has been reduced compared to the original standard. Reducing teaching subjects and at the same time reducing teaching time can relatively reduce excessive fatigue for children. (Xu Jin, 35, 6, 16)

### 40,000 Fans Throng the Yiyuan; Qingbai Defeats Xingdong United; The 3-1 Loss a Waterloo for the Visiting Team; Qingbai's Offense and Defense Show Excellent Performance

The Hong Kong Xingdong Football United Team, which had won four consecutive victories in its four away games in Shanghai, suffered a Waterloo yesterday in front of 40,000 fans at Yiyuan. Meeting the city's champion Qingbai Team, they suffered a crushing defeat with a score of 1 to 3. In the first half, Qingbai took the lead with 1-0. In the second half, they scored two more goals, and Xingdong almost went blank. Fortunately, in the last ten minutes, Li Shuoyou's corner kick allowed Liu Songsheng to break the duck egg record, resulting in a 3-1 score, which was very unexpected. The intensity of yesterday's competition between Qingbai and Xingdong, the brilliance of the performance, and the grandeur of the scene were the first in Shanghai's football scene in ten years since the National Games.

Unprecedented, Unparalleled Grandeur

The Football Committee, recognizing the inevitable tension of this competition and the inevitable crowding of the audience, specially moved the start of the game forward by one hour to 4:30 PM, originally intending to reduce the number of spectators somewhat. Who knew that there would be no impact at all? After 2:00 PM, fans continued to arrive in droves. By 3:30 PM, it was announced that it was full. After that, they still surged in like a tide. The roof of the grandstand was also full of people. On the opposite roof and in the trees, tens of thousands of heads were moving, which was a spectacular sight. Those who were shut out numbered in the thousands. Not a few climbed over the wall to enter. The surrounding fences were all broken through. They poured into the football field's grass. Although the military and police maintained order, it was ineffective. Some were knocked down, some were shouting, and the order was chaotic for a time, which was extremely regrettable. It is estimated that there were about 40,000 fans in total. More than 29,000 tickets were sold. The number of people who rushed in without tickets, climbed over the wall, and were on the roof and in the trees must have been over 10,000. The enthusiasm of the situation was directly comparable to the Hong Kong-Shanghai final in the National Games of that year.

Qingbai Team: Able to Attack and Defend

Qingbai's brilliant performance and victory were by no means accidental. Qingbai's victory yesterday can be said to be able to retreat to defend and advance to attack. Especially the three-cornered defense of Wu Qixiang, Yan Shixin, and Meng Yiliang was like an iron wall. Although Xingdong was strong, it was difficult to cross the red line. Supplemented by Gao Baozheng and Qu Yongfu, it became a natural barrier. Xingdong's fierce attack failed in the early stage of the first half, and it was here that their spirit was frustrated, and they eventually suffered defeat. Everyone in Qingbai was fighting desperately, which was the most brilliant performance yesterday. Among the forwards, A-Kui also sold his strength. The entire team fought carefully, without wasting a single ball. It can be said that this was Qingbai's most proud masterpiece. Xingdong's goalkeeper was slightly inferior. The changes in the formation in the second half made it even more difficult to cheer up. The forwards hit the wall and could not break in, which was especially beyond Xingdong's expectations. The formations of the two armies are as follows:

Qingbai

Qin Bigao

Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang

Qu Yongfu Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng

Cao Qiuting Luo Taofu Xu Wenkui (down) Li Yichen (up) Gu Yiche Fei Chunhua

Xingdong

Zhu Zhaohang

Xu Jingcheng (down) Huo Yaohua (up) Hou Rong (up) Sheng Huo Yaohua (down)

Luo Weiquan (down) Liu Songsheng (up) Xu Jingcheng (up) Guo Yingqi (down) Feng Kunsheng (down) Guo Yingqi (up)

Li Shuoyou Li Zhaorong Feng Jingxiang Zhang Jinhai Deng Guangsen (up) Liu Songsheng (down)

Xingdong Team: Repeated Attacks Fail

Referee Wu Shouheng blew the whistle to start the game. Xingdong attacked first, but was blocked by Baozheng. A-Kui passed to Xiaofei from afar. Li Yichen tried with a volley, and Huo Yaohua cleared the siege. After five minutes, Li Shuoyou cut in from the left corner. Wu Qixiang lay on the ground and shoveled it out. Before long, Deng Guangsen launched an attack from the right. Yan Shixin did the same, turning danger into safety. Xingdong's offensive was particularly fierce. Around ten minutes, Gu Yiche passed to the right corner, and Chunhua shot, but unfortunately it was slightly off. At the 20th minute, the audience poured into the stadium, and the game was temporarily suspended. After re-engagement, Xingdong continued to attack with all its strength, penetrating deep into Qingbai's hinterland. Qixiang and Shixin were firmly seated and there was no gap to take advantage of.

Qu Yongfu: Header Blooms

At the 37th minute, Li Sikai dribbled forward quickly. Xu Jingcheng failed to block him, and his hand kissed the ball. Li Yichen took the penalty kick. It was high and tricky from 15 yards out. Zhaohang pushed it into a corner kick. Xiaofei opened it well, and Qu Yongfu arrived in time for a header. The ball went into the net from the upper right corner, 1-0. Qingbai took the lead, and the audience cheered. The visiting team still tried to counterattack, but the first half ended.

Cao Qiuting: Scores Twice

After the break, Xingdong's formation was greatly adjusted. Rong Sheng left the field due to injury. A-Huo moved to fill the right back position. Xu Jingcheng backfilled Huo's position. Guo Yingqi sat in the center back position, and Kun Sheng entered the field as the right midfielder. Qingbai retained its original line-up. After the game started, Hai Lai Zhaorong passed and shot back, but it was saved by Bigao. At the tenth minute, Xiaofei passed to the left corner from afar. Qiuting intercepted the ball, raised his foot and shot. A-Huo and Zuojiao Wang Limou tried to remedy the situation, and fell together with Qiuting. Yingqi was about to rush to the rescue, but Xiao Sanzi had already climbed up and shot with his right foot from ten yards out. It was clear and beautiful, and the ball entered the goal from the gap. 2-0. Qingbai reported another victory. With Qingbai already winning two goals, their momentum became even stronger. After a long period of seesawing, at the 17th minute, Qiuting and Xiaofei flanked on both wings. Xiao Sanzi made another great contribution, 3-0. Qingbai scored three consecutive goals, and the outcome of the game was settled.

Liu Songsheng: Breaks the Duck Egg

The visiting team was unwilling to give up. The formation was changed again, and the situation was shaken, forming a melee. Qingbai changed to a strong defensive stance. At the 33rd minute, Yichen left the field, and Xiaoluo entered the field. A-Kui moved to the left, and was taken advantage of by the visiting team. Shuoyou's corner kick was swept into the net by Songsheng, 3-1. Xingdong pulled back a goal. With one minute left until the end of the game, Meng Yiliang committed a foul in the penalty area. Feng Jingxiang executed the penalty, but failed to score. Before long, the statutory time arrived, and the Hong Kong army suffered a crushing defeat with a score of 1-3.

### Chinese Stocks Affected by Government Bonds: Sellers Form a One-Sided Market, Major Speculators Stop Trading, All Stocks, Hot and Cold, Decline

Chinese stocks were affected by the excessive risks in the bond market before the holiday. As a result, major firms such as Gongda, Feida, and Tianyi went bankrupt, amounting to more than ten billion [currency unit]. Many in the industry were affected. Yesterday, major speculators stopped formal trading, losing the lively atmosphere of the past. All stocks were quoted off-exchange, making trading difficult and causing panic. As a result, the supply was exceptionally strong. Yongsha fell from 625 yuan to 575 yuan, and Meiya fell from 4100 yuan to 3700 yuan, before stabilizing slightly. Some of the smaller stocks had no trading at all at their lowest points. By noon, the panic had subsided slightly, and those with funds provided some support, causing the quotes to recover slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, the popular Yongsha and Meiya each fell by half a percent, while smaller stocks fell by half a percent to one percent. All unpopular small and medium-sized stocks also fell by half a percent to one percent. The fate of retail investors depends entirely on whether the major speculators can restore the situation to its original state immediately after the reorganization. This newspaper had warned about such phenomena long ago, but unfortunately, few listened. Foreign stocks were more orderly than Chinese stocks and were not significantly affected. Low prices were absorbed by various Chinese and foreign speculative funds. After weakening, they quickly rebounded. Jardine Matheson broke the 10,000 mark immediately after opening, but continued to fall to 9,200 yuan. As buying interest revived, it quickly rose back to 10,700 yuan near noon, before turning sideways. As a result, compared to the previous close, it still felt like a slight decline. British-American Tobacco was similar. Wheelock Marden rebounded slightly, while other stocks remained stable.

### US Dollar Trend Gradually Stabilizes

Exchange Rate Shows No Intention of Increasing

The momentum of foreign currency, the US dollar, weakened slightly. It opened at 2,630 yuan in the morning with sellers, but buyers remained hesitant. It retreated to around 2,560 yuan midway before stabilizing slightly. However, there were no special changes. It rose slightly to around 2,580 yuan near noon. The trend stabilized further in the afternoon, finally settling at around 2,600 yuan. As a result, it was down slightly by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong currency once fell below 450 yuan, but the result was similar to the previous close, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at around 460 yuan, and the Indian exchange rate at 560 yuan to 565 yuan, with some settlement of accounts. The official US dollar exchange rate remained unchanged.

It is also learned that financial authorities in Shanghai believe that the current foreign exchange policy should be maintained as it is. They also believe that increasing the exchange rate would do more harm than good, because, in terms of current exports, raising the exchange rate cannot solve the current difficulties, but would affect domestic finance and prices. It is reported that the authorities have no intention of raising the exchange rate, and that the recent measures decided by the Central Bank to restrict the settlement of foreign exchange for non-essential goods and to prohibit the use of US currency for remittances are considered appropriate by all parties to control the consumption of foreign exchange.

### Little Change in Gold Prices

Spot Gold Was Extremely Stable Yesterday

It opened at 1.89 million in the morning and gradually declined from 1.893 million to 1.87 million before stabilizing slightly. Speculative funds in the securities market bought on dips, and the situation was still likely to improve. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 181 bars at a price of 1.875 million, and there were even fewer changes after that. It rose back to 1.89 million at noon and was even more stable in the afternoon. As a result, it was up slightly by 3,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were tens of thousands of yuan. Informal short-term lending remained loose, but difficult to obtain easily, with interest rates still around 1.2 to 1.5 percent.

### Cotton Yarn Spot Market Unusually Tight: Large Distance Between Futures and Spot

The yarn market rose and fell yesterday. Large quantities of 20-count coarse yarn were still being absorbed by the Huainan group, who were choosing based on the ability to deliver spot goods. As a result, the distance between the spot price of Shuangma and the warehouse receipt widened. The former was once bid up to 1.4 million at its highest, while the latter was only selling for 1.256 million, lacking buyers. This was because the Guangdong group was rushing to meet shipping deadlines and chose to deliver spot goods. Other 20-count small and medium-sized yarns also followed slightly, but sales were particularly sluggish. 42-count doubled yarn and 32-count fine yarn fell by 355 million instead, because the goods released by the Textile Construction Corporation the day before were allocated according to the order. Therefore, those who were short on funds all lowered prices to sell.

### Dull Cotton Cloth Sales

The American and Mexican Cloths Opened Last Week Have Not Yet Been Picked Up by All Parties

The cotton cloth market is still fluctuating. Actual demand from customers is relatively weak, but the spot market is not very abundant, so the market situation is still stable. The Textile Construction Corporation's midday quotation for 12-pound fine cloth was 500 yuan lower than the previous period, but there was no supply of serge. The market rebounded slightly in the afternoon. The customers who put down deposits four days ago for the American and Mexican cloths opened last week and went to the warehouse to pick up the goods found that there were no spot goods to transport. It is said that the goods have been transported to other cities. As a result, the customers protested, and it was likely that they would be allowed to exchange for other patterns.

### Ordinary Raw Cotton Market Conditions

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraphic reports rose 17 to 30 points, with near-term at US$29.36, forward-term at 29.54, and Mitterling spot at 30.15. Spot raw cotton trading in this port was still good. Dasheng Yarn Mill purchased ordinary Mitterling, and Hengfeng Yarn Mill purchased sub-grade Brazilian cotton, each at two to three hundred bales.

The Social Bureau's rice registered by grain merchants has been decided to be distributed to retail rice and grain stores throughout the city. The first batch has already begun to be shipped. It is heard that future distribution of registered rice will depend on the sales situation, based on the principle of supplying actual needs. Retailers who receive and sell allocated rice can only add the legally prescribed profit margin to the original purchase price. If any price increases are found, they will be severely punished.

### Black Market Debts Mounting: Government Bonds Continue to Fall, Speculators Change Course at the Sight of Wind, Still Snatching Hats on Dips

Government bonds continue to fall. Some people are still confused by the desire to repay with customs gold, and those who are active gradually come and go. Also, because of mounting debts and too much risk, sellers are extra cautious. However, with the general trend gone, many holders would rather slip away first. Tongbing fell from an opening of 2,900 yuan in the morning to 2,200 yuan, and those covering shorts were still active. Also, because this price was close to the principal payment with customs gold, hat-snatchers took advantage of the low to be active, and the midday close recovered to around 2,600 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 500 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia and Yi fell by 400 yuan, Ding fell by 200 yuan, and Wu fell by 450 yuan. Outwardly strong but inwardly weak, the dangers have not been completely eliminated, and retail investors should be extremely cautious.

Each household was only allowed to bid for one case, and a total of about 20 cases were sold. Yesterday's silk market was particularly quiet. There were only a few transactions in silk for users, and prices were slightly lower by 1-20,000 yuan compared to the previous day, but there were still many holders who needed to sell, so there were very few transactions.

### United States Researching Vitamin Rice: California Rice Production Doubles This Year

[Reuters, New York, 18th] According to recent estimates, California's rice harvest this autumn may reach 770 million pounds, almost doubling the production of 1941. In normal times, the United States produces one percent of the world's rice, but in the first half of the 1945-46 trade year, the United States has already shipped about 42.6 million pounds of rice to Cuba, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines. Once the major rice-producing countries in Asia resume mass production, if California rice farmers continue their current high level of production, they will have to find new markets. According to the Rice Producers Association, the solution lies in encouraging the American public to eat more rice. The United States is currently researching the manufacture of "Vitamin Rice," a type of rice that, even after the bran is removed, can still retain a rich amount of Vitamin B1. The method first involves soaking the rice in water, heating it under high pressure, and then gradually reducing the temperature. As a result, the vitamin penetrates deep inside the rice and can last for a long time.

### United States Relaxes Price Controls

[United Press, Washington, 18th] American citizens will henceforth pay higher prices for butter, cheese, and canned milk. The price management office has issued an order allowing manufacturers to increase sales prices, effective immediately. The price increase method was approved yesterday evening as part of the plan to promote milk industry production announced on May 28.

### Longkou Vermicelli Rises

Longkou vermicelli rises in price due to active sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong, but the supply source is relatively scarce, so the market price has risen again and again. It had already risen from around 130,000 to 145,000 yuan the day before yesterday, and the market opened even higher at 150,000 yuan yesterday, with retail at 155,000 yuan, followed by 150,000 yuan to 145,000 yuan.

### Brazilian Silk Production

### In the Cradle of the Jianqiao Air Force: Air Heroes Talk About the Training of Fighters

Our Hangzhou, 15th Dispatch - Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

The birthplace of the Chinese Air Force, Hangzhou Jianqiao, which once annihilated the first batch of Japanese invaders, has finally been restored to its former glory with victory. The Air Force Officer School has also moved here to Hangzhou Jianqiao. They specially chose June 15th as the day for the reopening anniversary celebration. It was the plum rain season, with alternating sun and rain, symbolizing the growth of our Air Force in adversity.

Trained Warriors, Killed the Kisarazu

Following the highway to Jianqiao, I was greeted by Air Force Officer Mao Zhaopin after passing through the guards. He was a valiant soldier who fought with the American 14th Air Force, tall and handsome, looking like an exceptionally dashing young military officer. He led us to the lounge, where Director Zhou Zhirou and Education Director Liu Muqun greeted me and asked me to sit down. Chairman Shen Honglie told the reporter: "I participated in the First European War. At that time, the Navy was displaying its power! The Second World War was the world of air heroes. When I was in Shandong, I asked the officers and soldiers of the naval aviation to come to Jianqiao for training. I came here myself once in the 25th year of the Republic and saw that this school was extremely complete. After the enemy launched the war of aggression against China, when I was in charge of Shandong, I was grateful that they sent relief supplies from afar. I truly love these young people. They are truly patriotic, and their achievements cannot be erased!"

General Zhou Zhirou also told the reporter: "Building an air force talent pool is the most important thing. If we have talent, we will have a way. Our school was founded here on September 1, 1932. At that time, the roads were in terrible condition! Some of the students who were brought in were university graduates, and some were not used to aerial maneuvers, so they hesitated to come to school. We finally overcame many difficulties and trained air fighters. On August 14, 1937, Japan completely looked down on our air force, so they used their elite Kisarazu unit to attack us, but they didn't expect to be completely wiped out."

Going to Allied Countries for Training, Enhancing New Technologies

General Zhou smiled triumphantly and said: "We finally moved all the faculty, students, and most of the important equipment of the school to Kunming via the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Suzhou-Jiaxing-Nanjing-Shanghai line, through the capital, and then by water transport to Hankou, in the early August of that year. Within a few months, we had resumed training on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. From the seventh class to the most recently graduated twenty-second class, almost all the senior air force officers were products of the new school in Kunming. In Kunming, everything was still handled according to the old regulations of Jianqiao. However, the environment and supplies were not as good as in Jianqiao. In addition to transporting students for American training, which was actually more intense than the training in Jianqiao Wengjiabu, the Kunming school faced countless difficulties. In Kunming, although people were here, their hearts were really there. No one could forget Jianqiao. In India, the world of the Chinese Air Force expanded. After receiving some basic training, young Chinese Air Force members came to the Allied training centers in a steady stream to receive newer and more advanced technical training. Now they are back in Jianqiao. The purpose is not only to restore the old appearance but also to revitalize the spirit of Jianqiao to complete the more important mission that remains to be done."

I took the opportunity to ask about the situation of the Juvenile Air Force School. He said: "The Juvenile Air Force School was a trial program. As a result, we felt it was too wasteful because a training from childhood to adulthood, due to innate and acquired changes, has many things that are not necessarily suitable for the air force, and it costs a lot of money. The uniforms issued this year cannot be worn next year. I think in the future, each school should pay as much attention as possible to the necessary basic conditions. We don't plan to continue the next class."

To Be a First-Class Country, Requires a First-Class Air Force

Education Director Liu Muqun, who was sitting next to him, came from the Fujian Naval Aviation School and had visited many countries to observe the aviation industry. He was originally the Education Director of the Air Force Mechanical School and also served as the Education Director of the Air Force Staff School. Now he has been transferred to this position. Mr. Liu said to me: "Foreign air force schools do not welcome other countries to receive training. I have flown planes with them in the UK and the US, but I have not received their training. During the Second World War, we benefited greatly from the Lend-Lease Act. Now we have to build up the air force quickly! We have to catch up! Otherwise, a first-class country without a first-class air force cannot become a first-class country." From this, we talked about national affairs and the world situation. We reached a conclusion that we must "work hard quickly." He also told me: By the end of next year, China will begin to manufacture training aircraft. The factory that manufactures aircraft engines in the Dakongshan cave in Guizhou will also be moved out. Now, many mechanical and tube mechanical personnel are on their way from India to China. There are still many students in the United States. The reopening here was originally scheduled to start on May 1, but it was too late, so it was changed to May 11, but we are still preparing while starting work. He said: "The progress of weapons in this war is really amazing. I believe there will be changes in new tactics. However, because this victory was too quick, no one can announce it quickly. Our school should be in line with the latest tactics. If our understanding is insufficient and we think that the strong enemy has gone and we can sit back and relax from now on, and therefore slack off our efforts, then regardless of whether international conflicts are likely to occur in the short term, even if peace can be maintained, and a backward air force is used as the front line of national defense, the country's position cannot be improved."

A Big Balloon in the Auditorium Marked "The Whole Army is One Family"

We talked very happily. The bugle outside the window told us that the ceremony was about to begin, so we stepped into the auditorium. The auditorium was newly built, decorated with colorful balloons all around. On both sides of the podium were written "The Whole Army is One Family" and "The Whole School is One Family." There was a small white round lamp at each corner of the window, with silk tassels hanging below.

After the ceremony, we went to look around. The ground crew was tidying up the parts, and many valiant soldiers were taking off and performing in Stearman trainers. The Stearman trainer is a biplane single-engine aircraft that can seat two people. Now all the wings are painted yellow. It is very small and can soar to 12,000 feet. Major Cao Chaojue, the first person to fly a Stearman trainer over the Hump and return to the country, the chief instructor told me: "When he started his test flight in India, many foreigners did not believe that this small plane could fly over the Hump because their multi-engine planes had fallen down. Someone took a picture of him before he left (which the Air Force considers an unlucky omen), so he took it. As a result, he did fly over the Hump and arrived in China, and then flew back to India with the trainer group." Deng Huagao, a veteran member of the 14th Air Force, stood next to him and said: "We were always worried in India! Why didn't a telegram come back?" Cao said: "The British refused to send a telegram for me along the way, and they laughed at me for not having a radio plane."

Flying 30 Feet Low, Touring West Lake

Reporters were invited by Major Lai Senquan, who had fought in Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, and North China, and two warriors, Wang Wen and Chen Jiekang, to try an aerial tour. I was very happy to accept.

They talked to me as we walked, telling me how they had shot down enemy planes, how they had rescued personnel behind enemy lines, how they had transported supplies, and how they had killed enemies. I was very happy to hear that. We boarded the TA-17 aircraft. They told me how to fasten the parachute. Soaring in the sky, it was really something to be proud of! They flew as low as 30 feet, really touring West Lake in the courtyard. Along the edge of Baoshu Mountain, they slowly ascended, chasing the train three times. People in the train leaned out and waved to us.

The Qiantang River was like a belt, many mountains like steamed buns, the Qiantang River Bridge like an iron cable, and West Lake simply like a mirror decorated with lace.

We slowly glided back to Jianqiao. I shook hands with them and thanked them one by one. After getting off the plane, I saw a row of medal badges on their pockets. I recalled their past achievements, stood at attention, raised my hand to them, expressing my highest respect.

### On Chinese Political Parties

— Lu Shihao

The Chinese Nationalist Party in the past, and even today, is a gradually corrupting political party. However, it is because of its tendency towards corruption that it is in its current situation and has its future prospects.

To observe the Nationalist Party of today and the future, we must trace its past.

Generally speaking, in a difficult and arduous undertaking, at the moment of success, those who are engaged in that undertaking and struggling will certainly work together and be of one mind. Even if disputes arise in the middle, they can abandon prejudices and sacrifice their personal interests. But once the undertaking is successfully completed, opinions will diverge, and people will go to extremes, diminishing the glory of the achievement and even causing it to fall apart.

The predecessor of the Nationalist Party under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen committed this lamentable error! When the Manchu Qing Dynasty had not yet been overthrown, the comrades engaged in revolutionary struggle were united and fearless. But when the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, the comrades within the party disagreed. We can say that from the day of the revolution's success until his death, Sun Yat-sen seemed to have lost the power to control all the comrades within the party.

The Xinhai Revolution was an immature harvest, which was the most important reason for this situation. Another reason was that Sun Yat-sen took the overthrow of the Manchu Qing as his first task, and he devoted all his efforts to this work but neglected the unification of the beliefs and will of the comrades within the party. Thus, when the revolution unexpectedly and quickly succeeded, his personal greatness could not cover up the disputes and disunity among the other comrades. When the Three Principles of the People and the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction had not yet generally taken effect, communism, like an infectious disease, came to China. Subsequently, due to temporary expediency, communism was allowed to enter the revolutionary camp, and thus modern Chinese history began to be written with a tragic pen.

Around the time of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the ideological divisions and complexities among the members of the revolutionary camp were astonishing!

Sun Yat-sen was not wrong, but he was let down. Sun Yat-sen was definitely not an extreme right-wing or extreme left-wing figure, but his comrades went down these two paths. Even more tragic was the emergence of figures like Wang Jingwei, who said, "I will seek out the leftists in my dreams" but ended his life with "peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction." They used the acquisition of position and power as a guide for ideological transformation.

The split between the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party in those years was inevitable. We are saddened by the losses of the ten years of suppressing the communists, but we are even more saddened by the fact that the Chinese Nationalist Party lacked the support of the masses in the past, and after the completion of the Northern Expedition, it easily lost the support of the masses it had gained during the Northern Expedition.

Although these faults are attributed to the "national destiny" being bad, and the Northern Expedition was another abnormal success, the separatist forces remained, hindering the steps of national reconstruction.

This kind of excuse is wrong! We see:

In those days, the trend of democracy was not as turbulent and rampant as it is today. Since the Communist Party had become a political party that used military force, and the other newly emerging political societies were so nominal and ineffective, if the Nationalist Party had the determination and courage to strengthen the power of party rule under the name of "political tutelage," like the Soviet Union, and made considerable achievements with all its strength, the Chinese people, who had long suffered from hardship, would have sincerely supported it.

Unfortunately, the Nationalist Party had such an intention but lacked the determination and courage. The people granted power to the party, but the party did not use its power to help the people. On the contrary, it embarked on the path of corrupt bureaucratic politics. As a result, the Nationalist Party had many "members" of the masses but lost many of the masses. It gradually moved towards the abyss of corruption and became a political party with only members and almost no masses!

When the Sino-Japanese war broke out, the nearly dying Communist Party revived, and the Chinese Nationalist Party also woke up! During the war, the Nationalist Party gained experience and lessons in the struggle between political parties. After the victory, the separatist forces that outwardly obeyed but inwardly acted independently were eliminated (the Communist Party, as an openly separatist force, was an exception). The greatest gain was that the will within the party achieved firm and unified solidarity because of this war. The phenomenon of changing allegiances was gone. Therefore, this awakening of the Nationalist Party was a greater achievement than the revival of the Communist Party from near death.

What was said above, that the Nationalist Party is in its current situation and has its future prospects because of its corruption, how is this explained?

What is the current situation? Everything in recent days is the best answer. As for the meaning of "future prospects," I believe:——

As long as the Nationalist Party now knows the lessons of past corruption and is deeply vigilant, the suffering of today may well be the medicine stone of the future. If the Nationalist Party relies on some "latent forces" and the history of fighting for forty or fifty years to act as the "vanguard" of "democracy" with a superior attitude, then while the Nationalist Party feels the pain of the Communist Party's actions, it will naturally have a bright future when it catches up.

Two, The Communist Party

The growth and flourishing of the Communist Party were promoted by the weakness and corruption of the Nationalist Party. What will cause the Communist Party to fail in the future is not its distorted theory, but its failure to seize the opportunity for victory and the background of the times, coupled with the distorted behavior that results from this.

If the Nationalist Party had not been "innately deficient" and therefore weak, communism, which went from the study to society and the masses, would absolutely not have been able to grow and flourish so quickly. Unfortunately, when the Nationalist Party accommodated communism and joined hands with the Soviet Union in order to overthrow the warlords, the Chinese Communist Party, like a plant just sprouting, suddenly gained better soil and fertilizer, causing its branches and trunks to grow vigorously. Not only that, it even propagated its roots and vines to other plants in the original area. That is to say, some members of the Nationalist Party began to lean to the left, even to the point of breaking away from the Nationalist Party. In particular, the force that was the factor of the Nationalist Party's rebirth and development—military force—also contracted this problem. Some soldiers did not study the theory and practice of communism at all but joined the "left-leaning group," forming "armed communism," which led to the ten years of communist suppression and today's tragedy!

If we are to analyze the future fate of the Communist Party, it is not enough to base it solely on its distorted theory, which is not suitable for China. The majority of the Chinese people do not have the ability to accept and understand any party's theory at all, and the drawbacks of the distortion of communist theory have already been offset in the minds of another small group of people by the Nationalist Party's years of ineffective governance. Therefore, the factor in the Communist Party's failure should be said to be that it has already lost the opportunity to seize victory.

If a political party in a country hopes to engage in "revolutionary" work by means of military force, its chances of success depend on three factors: the corruption of the ruling party and domestic and foreign aggression and unrest. These three factors, combined with the agitation and military force of the "revolutionaries," can easily become a huge driving force and promote the success of the "overthrow."

In the period around the September 18th Incident, China was in a state of internal and external troubles, and the Nationalist Party was in a state of desperation. The Communist Party had all three of the above-mentioned factors and military force, making it an excellent opportunity to overthrow the Nationalist Party's rule. However, the Communist Party was confined to a corner and could not cause chaos to arise and stir up trouble everywhere. In this way, the Communist Party lost an excellent opportunity. Today, based on the above-mentioned situation, and recalling that the rulers of the Nationalist Party were willing to accept the condemnation of losing power and humiliating the country and abandoned the Northeast without resistance, we can imagine that their actions had their reasons and difficulties. Sure enough, look at what happened after the Xi'an Incident and the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The Communist Party, which had been suppressed for ten years and had gone through the "Long March," was strong again!

However, during the war, the Communist Party took a path that it thought was clever but was actually wrong. During the war, the strategy adopted by the Communist Party was to plunder, expand its territory, avoid contact with the Japanese army, and instead attack the troops under the rule of the Nationalist Party.

They thought that such a strategy could achieve the "fisherman's profit." Of course, their troops expanded, but the excessively large troops caused discipline to be abandoned and made the people feel afraid of their actions. At the same time, they avoided the real and attacked the weak, so the expanded troops lacked the tempering of hard battles.

If the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party had adopted the strategy of Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia during the war and strengthened the rear operations against the Japanese army, although the losses would have been great, it would not have hindered the strength of their troops. Moreover, his achievements would have certainly won the admiration and sympathy of domestic and foreign forces. In this way, they could have used these "achievements" to obtain "legitimate" weapons assistance, perhaps with some "secret sources" of supply. In that case, today's Zhu De and Mao Zedong would definitely not be just objects of adulation by some left-leaning writers, and the Communist Party's munitions would definitely not have relied solely on the Soviet Union transferring the Japanese army's guns to it.

The Communist Party did not do this, and the Nationalist Party fortunately avoided the last and most dangerous move.

Now, the Chinese Communist Party is making a final struggle. It has launched the most brutal turmoil. On the one hand, it avoids bearing the blame for "implementing civil war" and has to form a Political Consultative Conference with the Nationalist Party and the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and others. The result of the Political Consultative Conference can be said to be a success for the Nationalist Party rather than a success for the Communist Party.

If both the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party follow the results of the agreement, when China truly competes for political power through legitimate party struggles, the Communist Party's distorted theory, coupled with its absurd actions in recent years, will promote the Communist Party's path to failure. Then solve it by force. Communism has already laid down an iron curtain in a vast area of the world. Will another group allow this large piece of land in the Far East to be stained red?

The Northeast is the best territory in the Communist Party's ideals. But the Communist Party will be an "A Dou" that cannot be supported. If the troops are dispersed, they will be in danger of being defeated one by one. If the troops are concentrated in the Northeast and the "superiority" of the Northeast is fully utilized, there will still be the performance of Siping Street, and there is a danger of being wiped out in one fell swoop, which is even worse than being defeated one by one.

The Communist Party will definitely accept peace, but only when they are on the verge of exhaustion!

Finally, let us imagine what the Communist Party will be like after accepting peace and engaging in legitimate party struggles.

If we are a political observer, we can forgive the Communist Party's so-called absurd actions of "liberation" in recent years based on the principle that "the revolution justifies the means." But what about those who are personally affected?

In the future, the "rebirth" of the Nationalist Party and the rise of new political parties will definitely take away the new vitality of the Communist Party.

Finally, let us mention the Communist Party's distorted theory as a scalpel for dissecting the phenomenon of today's left-wing writers raving about the Nationalist Party and raving about the Communist Party.

Although the Communist Party has to try its best to forcibly integrate communist theory into the Three Principles of the People because the Three Principles of the People have taken root in China, the best footnote is still the recent speech by the Soviet Foreign Minister: "Communism believes that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the best form of democracy." (General meaning)

Regardless of whether the Chinese proletariat can implement its "dictatorial democracy," the biggest question is whether today's left-wing writers, who attack the Nationalist Party's one-party rule, political corruption, and lack of democracy, will be able to accept those "dictatorial democracies" in the future.

We can assert that they will definitely not accept it. Today's general "lower gentry" who lean to the left cannot tolerate the corrupt atmosphere of the Nationalist Party, so they naturally go from one extreme to the other. When a new, non-communist style, new left-leaning political party emerges, this group of "left-leaning elements" will definitely not speak up for the Communist Party again, even to the point of the British Labour Party rejecting the Communist Party.

When the Communist Party has lost the two best opportunities and wants to be able to grasp the dominance of China again, there are two ways: (1) a miracle from God, (2) the complete collapse of the world's anti-communist group. Is it possible? Wait and see!

Three, The Democratic League and the Youth Party

The constituent members of the Democratic League are the National Socialist Party, the Third Party, the Village Self-Government Faction, the National Salvation Association, and the Vocational Education Faction. When they organized the "Democratic League," they declared that the Democratic League would dissolve the form and characteristics of political parties and become an alliance of a broad democratic movement.

This ideal may be true. However, looking deeper, it is definitely not that simple. First, the Democratic League is still manipulated by the party leaders among its constituent members; second, it still acts in the political circle and absorbs "members" in the posture of a political party; although those new members are said to be mostly people without party affiliation, their actions follow the route led by the "alliance," so how is it different from the party members of a political party?

On the other hand, we can make the following analysis:

When the National Socialist Party and the Third Party felt that their own strength was too weak, they had to look for some new strength. It happened that the members of the Village Self-Government and Vocational Education National Salvation Association were eager to speak out politically. So, under the situation of the same interests, they merged into a "Democratic League."

The Third Party was originally called the Action Committee of the Nationalist Party because it was dissatisfied with the corruption of the Nationalist Party. During the era of this name, the Third Party still had ties with the Nationalist Party, at most it was an radical faction or reorganization faction within the Nationalist Party. But when it was renamed the Chinese National Liberation Committee, it completely broke away from the Nationalist Party.

From that time on, the Third Party even prepared to participate when the "Fujian People's Government" was established, which shows how anxious it was to find a "territory."

However, although the Third Party aspires to come out and enter the world with a posture between the Nationalists and the Communists, until now, they only have two public leaders—Zhang Bojun and Peng Zemin. Their participation in the Democratic League is an opportunistic move.

What is strange is the National Socialist Party's participation in the "alliance." The National Socialist Party already had a certain scale before the war, and its policy strategies were not incompatible with China's national conditions. If it had established itself independently like the Youth Party, its position today would not be so low.

If party struggle is secondary and "democracy" is primary, then the attitude of today's Democratic League has gone further and further and is quite different from the views of the National Socialist Party itself.

Is the Democratic League letting down the National Socialist Party? Or is the National Socialist Party itself moving towards "left-leaning" and agreeing with the attitude of today's "Democratic League"?

Judging from the recent attitude of the "Democratic League," it has become the echo of the Communist Party!

I believe that the Democratic League does not think that it can obtain "democracy" from communism, but hopes to "fight poison with poison" and use this to make the Nationalist Party "vomit" some "democracy." But they don't know that by doing so, the Communist Party will only increase its arrogance, go down some wrong paths, and cause China some more painful losses!

The "original intention" and "attitude" of the Democratic League are so different that the future of China's political struggles is too difficult and dangerous.

The "Democratic League" has become the tail of the Communist Party voluntarily. As for the Youth Party, it is inherently easy to get close to the Nationalist Party.

From the Republic of China year twelve to the present, from the Awakening Lion Society to its public appearance, the history of the Youth Party is not short, but the darkness of the past political situation prevented them from growing up.

Today, on the one hand, the Youth Party is dissatisfied with the behavior of the Communist Party, and on the other hand, it is too weak to take on great responsibilities on its own. Therefore, under the evolution of history and the drive of the environment, it can only get closer to the Nationalist Party.

This policy of the Youth Party is correct, but their "boldness" is unfortunately still not "outstanding." I hope that it can take advantage of the current opportunity to change its facade, enrich its content, and it will naturally be able to earn a higher position among the people in the future.

It does not harm a political party's past history and future life to add new vitality and change its "political views" or even its name.

### The Gestation of New Parties

In today's turbulent political situation in China, the gestation and growth of new political parties is an inevitable trend.

On the way to becoming an industrialized country and cleaning up China's bankrupt rural areas, the working class and peasants are the targets that future political parties will strive for. However, although the development of the labor movement and the exertion of the power of workers in the rising and falling labor tides can be seen in Shanghai or other more prosperous cities, when the proportion is made by region, it is still a pitifully small performance. In addition, the peasants, who are still catching their breath and are content with their fate, are very difficult to generally develop an understanding of politics in the short term. If these two objects are used as the power of new political parties alone, it is very difficult to achieve results in a short time.

It is said that Deng Fa, an important communist labor movement member who died in an accident in Shanxi a month ago, once encouraged current labor movement leaders to organize a Labor Party. If this plan is implemented, then the newly emerging Labor Party will be just a branch of communism, just like the Labor Progressive Party of Canada. Although the name does not have the words "communist," it is actually no different from a communist political party.

Conversely, if the emergence of the Labor Party is due to the instigation of the Nationalist Party, it is because the Nationalist Party wants to guide workers away from communism and weaken the power of the Communist Party.

Unless there are the above-mentioned factors, it is very difficult for the Labor Party to grow independently. Because China's labor movement has not yet been closely linked, it is developing separately in fragments, and it also lacks outstanding leaders. If communism wants to infiltrate the workers' organization and transform itself into a political group that tends to communism, it will be obstructed.

It is also reported that the Zhi Gong Tang, with the Gongmen Triad as its core, will hold a global kinship conference to organize the Zhi Gong Party. The Zhi Gong Tang provided financial assistance to the Nationalist Party in the early revolutionary work and did a lot to overthrow the Manchu Qing. The organization of the Hongmen was originally an anti-Qing organization. This kind of triad has a great potential force in overseas areas and in China. The leaders of the Zhi Gong Tang, Si Tu Meitang and Zhao Yu, have declared that they are inclined to the Nationalist Party. If the Zhi Gong Party can be inclined to the Nationalist Party and be established, then the Nationalist Party will gain assistance.

In the future political arena of China, we absolutely do not want to be like France, where too many political parties have emerged, so that the political situation has become a phenomenon of the tail wagging the dog. Therefore, thinking from the perspective of the interests of the people, the Nationalist Party does not want too many useless political parties to appear and cause chaos in the political sea. It should rather cultivate a strong new political party to compete with itself. In other words, the Nationalist Party should properly cultivate an opposition party that understands democracy and follows the political track. This is the blessing of Chinese democracy!

This new political party clearly contains a left-leaning atmosphere. They will focus on workers and peasants and infiltrate strong "nationalism" to absorb all the descendants of China.

When "fascism" declares its demise, some people will definitely oppose the theory of "nationalism," but China just needs these theories and realizations that are criticized as "crazy."

For a hundred years, China has been constantly invaded. The loss of land is obvious, and the decline of national ambition is a terrible and imperceptible danger. The psychology of most Chinese people has lost its lofty self-esteem, and they show inferior behavior towards foreigners. When Japan provoked the war, many people were optimistic and used history as an example, thinking that China has a large population and will definitely be assimilated like the Yuan and Qing dynasties in the past. But in fact, in the occupied areas, due to the Japanese planned enslavement, the increase in the "slave face" in the occupied areas is directly proportional to the decline in national will. This is a result of inheriting inferiority and humiliation towards Western nations.

At first, the foreign invasions were Western nations, so those who were self-conscious and dissatisfied with those Western nations' invasion of China naturally went to the other extreme. This is the reason for the phenomenon that today's general left-leaning elements in China are so left-leaning that they can sell out their motherland and distortedly protect the Soviet Union's improper behavior towards China.

No country's people, like the Chinese, are willing to use the interests of their motherland as a "sacrifice" for their belief in a certain doctrine!

Under this shameful and terrible situation, the newly born political parties in China must use a strong nationalistic concept to save the people who are heading towards destruction.

The Nationalist Party must cultivate and protect such a newly born political party. Although the Nationalist Party can add some "left-leaning" policies to win over the people, sudden reforms cannot absorb a large number of elements who are hesitating between "left" and "right" and those who have already "leaned to the left." Perhaps such a political party may surpass the Nationalist Party in a few years, but if the Nationalist Party loses the election and lets such an opposition party take over the power, it is much better than letting the Chinese Communist Party "sacrifice" the motherland.

We hope that the future party struggles in China can make China truly and practically reach the position of the strong, rather than weakening China's strength!

### Early Summer in Jinan: Relentless Hail Falls

By our Jinan correspondent, Jiang Jun

It is the early summer season, and the land north of Lixia is already filled with warmth. In Daming Lake, lotus flowers are budding, waiting to bloom. The rough-hewn Shandong girls no longer appear dull-eyed like in winter, and there is even a certain aesthetic appeal to them. However, just as the heat was at its peak, a relentless hailstorm suddenly arrived. The hailstones were as large as peaches and plums. For a time, violent winds, rain, and thunder intertwined, and Jinan city was suddenly without light. It was cold and desolate, with rustling and soughing sounds. Plants and trees lost their color, green leaves withered, and crops were drenched to the point of near death. According to local elders, this was a sight unseen in over twenty years and a sign of impending war.

### Social Services: Responding to Readers

Medical and Health

(1) Feng Shangqi asks: I see your newspaper's Social Services column answering readers' various life questions every day, and I am deeply admiring. My younger cousin suffers from arthritis, which has persisted for over ten years, causing anxiety for the entire family. There are no good hospitals in the inland, and Shanghai is too expensive. Therefore, I hope you can answer the following questions: My cousin is eighteen years old. At the age of six, he fell, causing his toes to swell up to his knee. He was treated by a traditional Chinese surgeon. At the age of twelve, he started to feel soreness from his ankle, reaching up to his knee, gradually worsening. Now, I earnestly request your answers: 1. What is the cause of this condition, and is there any specific medicine? 2. Are there any public hospitals in Shanghai that can effectively treat this condition? 3. What are the inpatient costs at such hospitals? 4. Apart from going to Shanghai for inpatient treatment, can he obtain medicine or purchase electrotherapy equipment to treat himself at home?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, MD]: This condition is tuberculous arthritis. 1. There is no specific medicine for tuberculosis. A plaster cast is the only treatment method. 2. Public hospitals in Shanghai can all provide treatment. 3. If admitted to the third-class ward of the Municipal Hospital, it is free of charge, with only food costs of about 1200 yuan. The cost of injections, medicine, and surgery is extra. 4. Not advisable.

(2) Yang Baorun asks: Kind sir: I am a typesetter who suffers from nearsightedness. In February or March of last year, a black spot the size of a grain of rice suddenly appeared in my right eye's line of sight, floating and sinking. I didn't pay much attention to it at first. After three or four months, this black spot gradually grew into a black line about an inch long, thin and light at the top and thick and round at the bottom, stretching across my line of sight. It stretches and bends as my eyeball moves, but it doesn't interfere with reading newspapers. Now, I want to ask you: Are these two black lines caused by the friction of trachoma on my eyeball? How can I check whether I have trachoma? My eyes feel unbearably dry in the summer. Is this a symptom of trachoma?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, MD]: This is definitely vitreous opacity. It is common in nearsighted eyes and is not caused by the friction of trachoma. Whether it is trachoma can be determined after a doctor's examination. Dry eyes in the summer are not necessarily a symptom of trachoma. Although the black lines, if left untreated, do not immediately lead to the danger of blindness, the symptoms may increase over time, further obstructing the line of sight. There are many trachoma medications on the market. You may want to try "Terregumin" eye drops. As for blurred vision, this symptom is present in various eye diseases and requires examination by an ophthalmologist. It cannot be answered carelessly.

(3) Jingfa asks: My wife has a hard lump on the upper corner of her right breast. It doesn't hurt unless touched. The skin looks normal, with no bulging or swelling. I don't know what disease it is. Is it dangerous? I am a salaried worker, and it is difficult to maintain my daily life. I don't have extra money for medical treatment. I earnestly request you to provide a simple treatment method. It would be a kindness akin to rebirth.

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, MD]: It may be mastitis and requires consultation with a surgeon. It is not dangerous.

### Old Man in a Flowered Coat

— Shao Fu

My friend, Elder Shu, is nearly seventy. Today, he came in excitedly with a paper box, saying smugly:

"I bought a glass raincoat."

The friends present were taken aback, because the old man has always been a gentleman with a serious demeanor, and he often criticizes the frivolousness of young people today. Today, he actually follows the trend, believing that the old man's recent life has been different.

The old man slowly said:

"I bought this coat not to be fashionable, but for economic reasons. Rainproof cloth made of domestic products also costs 50,000 yuan, but now, with an increase of only 10,000 yuan, I can get this 'Plastic' thing. Why would I choose the former over the latter? Wouldn't that be a waste of money?"

So the old man tried on his new coat in front of his friends, swaying a few steps, looking ahead and behind for a long time. Finally, he pointed to his new coat and sighed:

"This coat is beautiful, economical, and waterproof, but I don't know what will happen after it gets dirty? What will happen if it catches fire?"

None of the friends could answer. The old man took it off, folded it neatly, put it back in the box, and left, looking thoughtful.

Buying a glass raincoat is not a deviation from the norm. The reason I wrote this sketch is just to illustrate that the influx of foreign goods has destroyed all national industries, putting the national economy in a more serious crisis. What's so strange about an old man wearing a flowered coat and swaggering through the streets?

### Fifty Years of Automobile Invention: Detroit Hoped to Build 4.5 Million Cars in 1946

— MK

On March 6, 1896, nearing midnight, a young inventor named Charles Brady King drove a two-seater carriage-like vehicle out of a machine shop on St. Antoine Street in Detroit. He drove this four-cylinder car, which he had worked hard on for several months, wobbling straight to Russell Street, finally stalling and wheezing. The onlookers laughed and shouted, "Hey, hire a horse to tow it!"

This young man was not actually the first person to invent an automobile. As early as 1763, a Frenchman named Cugnot had already built a steam-powered car. Moreover, he was not the first to use gasoline as a driving force, because in 1886, a German named Benz had already built a car in Mannheim. However, King was the first to build a gasoline car and drive it on the streets of Detroit, which later became the world's automobile capital.

In early June of this year, the city of Detroit commemorated the 50th anniversary of King's first automobile invention. This industry has now grown to a value of 45 billion US dollars, employs the largest number of workers, and has changed the living habits of the entire world. Among those who participated in the 50th-anniversary celebration was a small, thin old man named Henry Ford. Fifty years ago, on that night when King drove his first car, he was riding a bicycle behind him.

In 1896, Ford, who was a good friend of King's, was working as the chief engineer of the Detroit Edison Company, earning a salary of 150 yuan per month. In the kitchen of the house he rented on Bagley Avenue for 16 yuan a month, he placed a single-cylinder engine for experimentation in the sink. When he was experimenting, his wife was often worried that their two-year-old son sleeping next door would be suffocated by the smoke. He built the car body in the coal storage room behind the house. When it was finished, he had to tear down a corner of the wall to get the car out the door. On June 4, 1896, Ford test-drove the car for the first time, with King also sitting in the car. They drove for nine miles without any problems.

Henry Ford tried to raise funds to organize a company, but failed twice before he finally managed to successfully organize his automobile company. In 1903, he and eleven friends jointly raised 28,000 US dollars to establish the Ford Motor Company. At that time, Ransom Olds, who had already raised 199,000 US dollars in capital, was able to produce about 5,000 cars a year.

At that time, automobile companies in Europe were also springing up rapidly. In Britain, progress was hindered by the government's so-called "Red Flag Act," which stipulated that whenever a "new type of vehicle" came out, a person must sit in front of it, holding a red flag in the daytime and a red light at night. This act was repealed in November 1896, an event as important in the history of the British automobile industry as the appearance of King's and Ford's first cars in America.

Detroit's 50th anniversary of the automobile invention was a grand occasion. In the city park, a huge, splitting atom was bound with neon lights: "Automobiles are ready to use atomic energy." Two famous poets, Robinson and Rapp, even wrote a commemorative song for this.

The automobile industry had its most prosperous era after World War I. It may not be so smooth afterward. But it has created one-seventh of the national gross income. The automobile manufacturing industry is prepared to invest 1 billion US dollars in expansion and improvement. Several important companies, such as General Motors and Ford, are striving to produce low-priced cars in 1947. Each factory has great plans, spending tens of millions of dollars on research.

But setbacks followed closely behind. Last year, Detroit hoped to build 4.5 million cars in 1946. But serious strikes followed one after another. By June 1, only 750,000 cars had been built. This year, it would be considered lucky to produce 2 million cars.

### A Record of Cursing Dogs

— Wan Jun

I belong to the sign of the Dog, but I have no affection for dogs. When I'm in poor alleys, I'm especially afraid of dogs.

However, dogs have no animosity toward me, and I've never been bitten by one. My lack of affection for them is because of the distinction between humans and animals. As for fearing them, it's entirely due to their appearance and their imposing manner.

Today, I unexpectedly saw dogs in a reception room. Not just one dog, but a pair of them.

I was alone in the reception room. The host hadn't arrived yet. Suddenly, the doorknob turned, and this pair of beasts burst in. Bursting in wasn't the problem. They ran straight toward me.

"I could see clearly that they were a pair of large German Shepherds that had undergone considerable training.

They approached me and flanked me, their mouths open, tongues out, eyes glaring, panting heavily, their tails hanging down.

One's long tongue licked my ear, and the other smelled my cheek on the other side. My sense of smell caught the musky smell, and my heart began to tremble.

They licked and smelled, from my head to my neck, to my shoulders, to my chest and abdomen, all the way down to my heels. My face turned green and then white, and my whole body was trembling. My skull felt like it was about to explode, constantly producing a deafening roar that only I could hear.

I wanted to escape, but I was too scared and weak to move. I hated the host, and I was afraid of the dogs, afraid that their wild nature would take over and I would be dismembered in an instant.

It's not uncommon for people here to have their buttocks bitten off, their scrotums torn, or their chests and abdomens pierced. They are all our pitiful Chinese people, supposedly the scum of humanity(?). However, even scum has its uses. In the blink of an eye, the remains are taken away without anyone noticing and sold as curry beef!

— In this world of cannibalism, I'm afraid that my skinny bones and flesh will be used for this purpose.

I trembled so much that my teeth chattered audibly. I trembled so much that cold sweat poured down my body, soaking my heavy clothes.

And the dogs were still on my left and right, licking and smelling. I was still smelling their musky smell in my panic.

Suddenly, the two dogs retreated, moving more than three feet away from me, squatting on my left and right, but their mouths were still open, their tongues were still out, they were still panting heavily, as if watching me.

Sure enough, when I stretched out my foot slightly, they threatened to pounce.

Although I was slightly less panicked at this point, I was still not free from the danger of being bitten.

However, my courage gradually grew stronger from the fear, and at the same time, I hated these two beasts. Although it was inconvenient to jump up immediately, I was already looking around for weapons to fight them. Unfortunately, the reception room only had a few sofas, not even a vase to use as a slingshot.

But I was ready to fight them!

The dogs seemed to understand what I meant and paid even more attention to me.

They were the size of calves. Standing up, I estimated that they were as tall as me. Judging from their attitude, they seemed used to biting people. I imagined that many people had died under their claws. Those who had died under their claws must have been our people. Perhaps I was "invited" here because they were hungry. Or, there must be a reason: to have them check me out first.

My indignation gradually increased, and my hatred grew at the same time. My eyes flashed with fire, and I began to curse them in my heart.

It was difficult to get rid of the danger and walk out of the door of that reception room. My heart was heavier, and my legs were numb, and I could hardly lift them.

When I reread the diary from three years ago and found the above article in the crevices, I seemed to have died once three years ago.

### Shanghai People Want Money, Not Life - You Can't Stop Shanghai Speculation, Even if You Drop an Atomic Bomb

— Chuan Qiu

The following is published from the recent May-June issue of Life magazine sent to Shanghai, based on facts from February and early March. If they saw the May cost of living index and current prices, how would they even write?

Part despair, part inflation, plus two parts speculation, have turned Shanghai upside down!

The Paradox of Money

Among the world cities suffering from money madness after the war, Shanghai is considered extremely paradoxical. Having money is everything, but at the same time, it is also equivalent to having nothing. If people deposit millions in the bank, they don't feel rich. They prefer to buy hundreds of dan of rice to store in warehouses. No one invests in currency, at least not in Chinese legal tender. If a Shanghai friend feels particularly well-off, they will say, "I'm worth about a million US dollars." If another looks okay but isn't doing so well, they will say, "I'm only worth a million Chinese legal tender." The so-called Chinese legal tender is worth about two-thousandths of a US dollar.

Nevertheless, this kind of contempt for paper money doesn't stop people from wanting more. In fact, the only thing that can keep pace with this insane inflation is insane speculation. A White Russian merchant, with the air of a philosopher, said, "You can't stop Shanghai speculation, just as you can't stop war. If you drop an atomic bomb in downtown Shanghai today, the survivors in the suburbs will immediately start trading in radioactive calcium powder."

Not for Eating Sardines

This White Russian, flashing three gold teeth, spoke eloquently about Shanghai's speculation. A box of sardines is bought and sold repeatedly, with the price rising higher and higher. They mostly trade with paper contracts. When the last buyer finally asks to inspect the box of sardines, it is finally found at the bottom of a warehouse several miles outside Shanghai. The buyer opens the box, takes out a can of sardines, opens it, and finds that the fish inside is rotten. He is furious and runs to the reputable seller to accuse him of fraud. But the seller is equally furious and says indignantly, "Fool! Everyone knows these sardines are for kicking around, not for eating!"

The Purchasing Power of US Dollars is Only 20%

According to old Shanghai residents, the current speculation in Shanghai is no worse than in the past. The reason it seems more chaotic than before is that everything in Shanghai, except the roads, is linked to astronomical inflation figures. This situation is similar to that in Germany after 1920. Taking 1936, the last year before the war, as a base, by February of this year, the food index had risen 1,900 times, the housing index 543 times, and clothing 3,461 times. Although the government has recently stated that it is making every effort to stabilize the currency, the signs of inflation are like a kite string, constantly extending. In early March, the cost of living index rose another 40%. (Translator's note: The cost of living index in May was even more terrible.) Thus, salaried workers have to engage in "skimming" or small-scale speculation to earn extra money to make up for the shortfall in income. American citizens, who have benefited from foreign exchange in the past few years, are now also caught in the vortex. The purchasing power of US dollars in Shanghai is now only 20% of what it was before the war.

The Definition of "Key Money"

The only price control currently implemented in Shanghai is rent control. The municipal government is very concerned about regulating rent increases by landlords, with the maximum increase limited to 60 times the pre-war level. But landlords are also human, and they are unwilling to give up the opportunity to make money. So other tricks emerged. Just a few days ago, a family was lucky enough to find a five-room apartment with sanitary facilities, with the rent as usual, but at the same time, they paid "key money" of US$4,500. This situation is almost universal and considered normal. I asked a Chinese landlord to define "key money." He replied gently, "It is a non-refundable deposit."

Speculation and profit-taking on Shanghai housing are not limited to landlords; lease rights can also be bought and sold. A friend of mine lives on Nanjing Road in two cramped furnished rooms. Someone is willing to pay him gold bars worth US$8,000 if he is willing to move out. My friend is willing to let it go, but he insists on no less than gold bars worth US$10,000.

Huge Expenses

Anyone who is lucky enough to get an apartment still has to worry about making ends meet. An American couple calculated their living expenses for last month, most of which was for food, totaling US$800. Any American housewife would be surprised to hear that this couple spends so much in a month. But if she knew the prices in Shanghai, she would understand. A scrawny spring chicken, $3 (USD same below), a pound of American coffee, $3.50, a pair of nylon stockings, $35, a pack of cigarettes, $6—and these are not black market prices. Speaking of cigarettes, importers ship them from the US to Shanghai, including shipping and tariffs, the cost is $2 per pack. Wholesalers sell them to retailers for $3 per pack, and retailers double the price to consumers.

American Soldiers Become Smugglers

Until General Wedemeyer recently cracked down on them, American soldiers stationed in China had been freely engaged in large-scale business. One American soldier almost monopolized all future import contracts for cosmetics, enjoying exclusive profits. Another officer in charge of procuring military food signed a contract with a client worth over US$1 million, preparing to establish his own import and export business after retiring. Before civilians could travel between Shanghai and North China on military or CNAC planes, a soldier who knew fur often used his position to travel back and forth between Tianjin and Shanghai, procuring furs for Shanghai merchants and earning large commissions. The remaining American soldiers who stayed in Shanghai and didn't have wings invested their money and talents in bars and nightclubs.

The oldest American military trick in China, until General Wedemeyer ordered a strict ban, was currency exchange. The danger of this was slightly greater than the profit. Because of the volatility of Chinese currency, like addicts, American soldiers who knew the secrets took advantage of the opportunity to transport Chinese troops from the interior to Shanghai and North China, exchanging one US dollar for 2,000 Chinese legal tender in Kunming. In Beijing, they exchanged 500 Chinese legal tender back for one US dollar. At the same time, they bought a gold bar for 450 yuan in Beijing and sold it in Shanghai for 700 US dollars. They returned to Kunming with the surplus and started their business again, over and over again. Now that the Chinese currency is more stable and military management is stricter, those American soldiers who are一心想賺錢 have changed their careers and joined organizations like 　聯　, so they can do their own thing, not afraid of fines or donations, how convenient.

The Black Market Within the Black Market

A foreign stockbroker once said, "In Shanghai, there is a black market, a black black market, and even a black black black market." Buying and selling gold bars, US dollars, and Chinese legal tender are all illegal. But in every street in downtown Shanghai, it is done very openly. This is the usual black market. As for the "black black market," it is conducted on a less public basis. It often requires a contact who can handle such transactions. As for the "black black black market," no one is willing to talk about it, even if they admit it exists. For example, UNRRA sells flour to the Chinese Hsing Chen, which then sells it to the public for 9,000 yuan (Chinese legal tender) per dan (133 and 1/3 pounds). Somehow, this flour is shipped to Tianjin by sailboat, and the price jumps to 20,000 yuan. The Chinese government does not interfere with this because, according to their explanation, Tianjin would not get any flour otherwise. The reason is that the government has no ships, the trains are not running, and the American planes have no gasoline or maintenance pilots.

Few Shanghai people are optimistic about Shanghai's economic prospects, except for those pot-bellied rich men who check their US dollars and legal tender and smile. Ordinary people don't have the power to afford a house, and ordinary women have never seen UNRRA flour in their hands, so they are not happy. A Shanghai unpopular food commissioner, Mr. Wang, said, "This is meaningless, you know. I buy goods for one million yuan and sell them for two million yuan. Suppose I take these two million yuan to buy some more goods and sell them for four million yuan. You would say that I have earned three million yuan. But suppose I want to buy back that first batch of goods again, now it will cost me five million yuan. So in the end, I lose one million yuan, what can I do?"

### Going to Japan

— Gang

In early June, a thousand wives and children of US Eighth Army soldiers set off for Japan. The booklet issued to them by the Department of the Army contained the following sentences: "There are flowers and fruits all year round, and there are very few freezing days." "Servants are easy to hire. An average family needs about three servants: a cook, a laundress, and a boy or girl. Wages are reasonable, about ten yuan per person per month." "There are many good Japanese tailors... there are not many beauty salons, and there are plans to add them."

### Building a Bridge Over the Huangpu River, Opening a Tunnel Under the Huangpu River

— Wang Guangyuan

Pudong and Puxi are separated by a river, but one side has high-rise buildings, while the other has crisscrossing fields. This is of course only because there is no bridge or tunnel on the Huangpu River. I remember that Brooklyn in New York is very similar to Pudong in Shanghai, and the situation in New York is also very similar to Shanghai. However, Brooklyn has developed equally with other districts of New York, with no difference. If there were a bridge or tunnel on the Huangpu River, Pudong could at least keep pace with Brooklyn within ten or eight years.

There is a lot of debate about building bridges and tunnels. Based on fragmented articles in newspapers and magazines and the leftovers of experts' arguments, it is very interesting and worthwhile to study.

Now I will tell a story. Before the War of Resistance, in order to strengthen the transportation between Nanjing-Shanghai and Zhejiang, there was such a debate on the Qiantang River: bridge experts liked building bridges, and tunnel experts liked building tunnels. Bridge experts said: Bridges are more economical and easier to maintain. Tunnel experts said that tunnels have national defense value. A bomb can break a bridge, but it can never destroy a tunnel. Moreover, the cost of tunnels is not much different. We outsiders did not understand these arguments clearly. It was only later that the bridge became a reality, and the tunnel was never built.

It is said that building bridges was not only because of economic relations. Chinese people are sometimes very generous. There were also some "situational" factors (human feelings, power). Who knew that later, the Qiantang River Bridge, because of the raging tide, the bridge piers were built and destroyed repeatedly, not only were materials lost, but also many lives were sacrificed. As a result, the budget was greatly exceeded. When the tunnel expert heard about it, he shouted that tunnels would not require such waste!

The situation on the Huangpu River is somewhat similar. Bridge experts not only like building bridges, but also say that the soil on the Huangpu River is loose, making it impossible to build tunnels. They can't build high bridges, and they even want to build flat bridges. Tunnel experts, of course, cite evidence and insist on building tunnels. These arguments make it difficult for us ordinary people who are not experts to know what to do.

Leaving aside the high-level arguments of experts, I have a few opinions:

(1) It is said that whether bridge experts or tunnel experts, they all like to build bridges and tunnels on the Huangpu River next to Zhongzheng Road. Why must it be built next to Zhongzheng Road? Why not build it in Nanshi Dongjiadu, where the river is narrowest and the riverbed is smallest? Moreover, according to the current Director of the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Bureau, the most prosperous area of Shanghai in the future will not be the "concession" or Jiangwan, but the current Nanshi. The river surface of Nanshi Dongjiadu is only two-thirds of that of Zhongzheng Road. If a bridge or tunnel is built there, it will not only be in a suitable location in the future, but also save one-third of the engineering and expenses, wouldn't it?

(2) It is said that after the invention of the atomic bomb, the national defense value of tunnels and bridges is no different. In fact, before an atomic bomb is dropped on Shanghai, a small-scale conflict or war cannot be prevented. At that time, although the tunnel has no national defense value, it at least has "city defense" value.

(3) Finally, I hope that bridge experts and tunnel experts will hold a public debate and promotion so that ordinary people can also know some of the content of the debate. If the arguments cannot be finalized, bridge experts or tunnel experts may as well have a "consultation."

### Patting the Cat's Head, Scratching the Dog's Head

— Wuling Ren

After the Grain Loan Scandal was exposed, some people felt sorry for Wu Rongsheng and Rong Yongming, and at the same time felt that the case was too trivial. However, according to reports, there is also Yao Changxian, who is even more trivial than Wu Rong and is currently being seriously tried in court. Because Yao sold 30 bags of rice in March, he was arrested by the authorities for allegedly raising rice prices and manipulating the market. Although I dare not say whether it is a wrongful conviction, Yao Changxian should take a breath today!

The price of a haircut was only two jiao before the war, but now it is 2,000, which has increased exactly 10,000 times. Small citizens feel overwhelmed. The wife of a barber still sighed, saying, "Patting the cat's head, scratching the dog's head, working so hard to earn money is not enough to support the family:" which makes people not know whether to laugh or cry.

The villa where Mrs. Du Yueyuan lives is said to belong to General Feng Yuxiang, and there is currently a dispute over it. A win-win solution is to live together. Fortunately, General Feng has always advocated frugality and does not like spacious houses. Mrs. Du only has her mother and children, and Mr. Du was a friend of the general before his death. If there are no other reasons, this solution should be approved by both parties.

A certain news agency said: After the municipal government banned civil servants from entering dance halls, the dance hall industry in the city will decline significantly. According to people in the dance hall industry, most of the dancers are usually wealthy merchants and civil servants. Now that civil servants have disappeared, wealthy merchants no longer need to come here for entertainment. I am extremely surprised. Aren't civil servants complaining about not being able to survive? Then which kind of civil servants are causing the dance hall industry to decline?

### Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference: Subtle, Complex, and Difficult to be Optimistic

——Special Compilation by This Newspaper's Translation Department——

(1) Origins of the Conference

More than a year has passed since Germany's surrender, but many of the postwar problems in Europe remain largely unresolved. Minor issues may have reached agreements, but important matters are still unresolved. Now, the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference has reconvened after a month-long recess.

To better explain the causes and consequences of the Foreign Ministers Conference, we will briefly narrate the establishment and development of the conference. As everyone knows, the "Foreign Ministers Conference" is a new product of World War II, stemming from the Potsdam Declaration issued after the meeting of the Big Three (US, UK, and USSR) in Berlin on July 17, 1945. Its purpose was to promptly conclude peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, to bring these countries back to normalcy after the Allied victory in Europe.

On September 11, a Five-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was held in London to conduct practical discussions on signing peace treaties with the five Axis satellite states. At that time, fierce disputes arose in the assembly regarding the trusteeship of Italian colonies and the participation of China and France in the preparation of the peace treaties. This eventually led to the main reason for the deadlock, and the meeting ended in discord without reaching an agreement.

To salvage the stalemate caused by the London Foreign Ministers Conference, a conference of the Foreign Ministers of the UK, US, and USSR was held in Moscow on December 15, reducing the conference from five foreign ministers to three, which was itself a compromise. At the Moscow Conference, it was decided that the UK and USSR would draft the peace treaty with Finland, the UK, US, and USSR would draft the treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and the UK, France, US, and USSR would draft the treaty with Italy. After the conclusion of the conference, representatives from the four powers conducted the drafting of the peace treaties in London. Although the meeting was held more than thirty times, progress was minimal due to the divergence of opinions and insistence on one's own position, so the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference, originally scheduled for May 1, had to be postponed. In order to break this deadlock, US Secretary of State Byrnes invited the foreign ministers of the UK, USSR, and France to a meeting in Paris on May 5, which was subsequently endorsed by the UK, France, and USSR.

(2) Previous Results

The Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference lasted twenty-two days from its opening at the Luxembourg Palace on April 25 to its recess on May 16. The main purpose of the conference was to break the deadlock in drafting the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland. Later, it also involved the issues of Germany and Austria, but the real work was to adjust the conflicts between the UK and the US and the Soviet Union.

The first issue discussed at the conference was the peace treaty with Italy, which involved a considerable number of topics. It can be said that compromises have been reached on the secondary parts. For example, it was decided that Italy should pay $75 million in reparations to the Soviet Union; the issue of the disposal of the Italian fleet was decided with some warships remaining with Italy, and the remaining ships being divided among the four powers, with a small number allocated to Greece and Yugoslavia; the issue of the Italian-Austrian border was decided with the southern Upper Adige region of Tyrol remaining with Italy; the issue of the French-Italian border was decided with a survey commission being sent to conduct on-site inspections; regarding the issue of the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands, the UK, US, and France advocated giving them to Greece, while the Soviet representative advocated postponing the decision.

However, more important issues remained unresolved: regarding the issue of Italian territories in Africa, France advocated that Italy administer its former territories under the control of the United Nations, while the Soviet representative proposed establishing an international trusteeship system, with Tripolitania being jointly administered by Italy and the Soviet Union, and Cyrenaica being jointly administered by the UK and Italy. The Soviet representative eventually supported the French proposal, believing that he had made a major concession, but the UK and the US believed that the Soviet Union's previous demands were themselves a luxury and could not be accepted at all. As for the UK, it firmly demanded that Cyrenaica be placed under British trusteeship. As a result, although the scope of the issue had narrowed, no resolution was reached.

But the most important issue was still the southern border of Italy. According to the Soviet proposal, Venice Giulia and Trieste should be owned by Yugoslavia, which differed greatly from the proposals of the UK and the US. Later, the UK and the US expressed their willingness to support the more moderate plan of the French representative, but the Soviet representative was determined, and no agreement was reached. According to Molotov's arguments and the comments of communist newspapers in Europe, the failure of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference was mainly due to the refusal of the British and American representatives to cede Trieste and its hinterland to Yugoslavia.

Regarding the Balkan peace treaty issue, the conference decided that Hungary should return Outer Transylvania to Romania. The border between Romania and Bulgaria remained unchanged. However, the focus of the issue was on the international control of navigation on the Danube River. Regarding this matter, British Foreign Secretary Bevin suggested placing the Danube waterway under international control, while Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov believed that this issue should be decided jointly by the countries along the Danube River. Some people in the UK and the US believed that the Soviet Union was deliberately erecting an "Iron Curtain" in Eastern Europe, while the Soviet Union suspected that the UK and the US had other political motives, and the mutual suspicion led to no resolution being reached.

Regarding the issues of Germany and Austria, in addition to the French proposal to discuss the Ruhr, Rhineland, and Saar regions, which was not resolved, the US representative also proposed that the four countries sign a twenty-five-year treaty to resolve the German armaments issue and discuss the peace treaty with Austria, believing that the current chaotic situation in Europe must be resolved as soon as possible. However, the Soviet Union refused to discuss it on the grounds that it went beyond the scope of the Potsdam Declaration. Germany and Austria are now occupied by the armies of the UK, US, USSR, and France in separate zones, and the situation is quite complicated, but these two countries are located in the center of Europe, and their relationship is indeed significant. Now that the discussion of the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland has encountered many difficulties, there will inevitably be more twists and turns in the future when discussing the issues of Germany and Austria, and countries will need to exert greater influence.

The unresolved issues from the previous Paris conference are now being attempted to be resolved again by the four foreign ministers. The world's expectations are self-evident.

(3) Future Prospects

During the month-long recess of the Foreign Ministers Conference, diplomatic representatives and experts from various countries have certainly reviewed the outstanding issues, but as of now, there seems to be no major progress. Byrnes emphasized the unanimous and firm policy of the United States in a radio address, but Molotov said that what the UK and the US had decided to take was not a "peace offensive" but an "offensive against the Soviet Union." Bevin delivered diplomatic speeches in the British House of Commons and at the Labor Party's annual meeting, reiterating the UK's position and criticizing the Soviet Union, while Soviet newspapers did not carry a single word about Bevin's recent speeches, but constantly attacked the policies of the UK and the US. There is really no reason to be overly optimistic about the future of the conference.

However, the continued convening of the conference is still a good sign. It is hoped that the four foreign ministers will learn reasonable lessons from the past "trial and error" and seek appropriate solutions. In this way, not only will the people of Europe rejoice, but the people of the whole world will dance with joy after seeing the true dawn of peace.

### Inside Poland: Civil War is Underway; Communists Run Rampant

Since the end of the war, successive international conferences have not seemed to have the intention of solving any problems. Since Germany's surrender, the problems have become more and more numerous and more and more complex. The Foreign Ministers Conference held in Paris did not resolve any difficulties. In Germany, the UK and the US suddenly felt that a Germany divided into three zones, each with its own administration, was indeed extremely dangerous. France, which has been liberated for two years, feels that it has not yet found a definite form of government. As for Russia, after sowing the seeds of communist ideology in Eastern Europe, resistance has now been stirred up everywhere. Poland has suffered the most from the war, and this resistance has been stirred up the fastest.

According to news from British and American diplomatic circles, a civil war has been triggered in Poland, with large numbers of people resisting the Polish Communist government under Soviet influence. This result may lead to the Soviet Union and the Western powers finally standing up and causing a new incident. At present, the civil war is still only in the stage of guerrilla warfare, but in the month of April alone, 6,952 civilians have been arrested and killed by officials of the Communist government on the grounds of being "terrorists supported by foreign reactionaries."

In fact, the current Polish people have been divided into two major factions: one faction is the supporters of the Communist government, and the other faction is the followers of Deputy Prime Minister and Peasants' Party leader Mikołajczyk. According to estimates from two months ago, the Peasants' Party has accounted for 70% of the total number of voters. Diplomatic observers believe that 90% to 95% of the people support him, including figures from all factions, and—strangely enough—nobles and the former landlord class also support this Peasants' Party.

The Polish communists have seen this and have recently launched a campaign to suppress the Peasants' Party. Arrests and assassinations are everywhere. Mikołajczyk has personally told Allied diplomats that he is afraid of being assassinated himself.

The political crisis in Poland only became apparent after a speech by Peasants' Party Deputy Leader Penczek on April 26. American reporters telegraphed this speech to Washington that day, but due to inspection delays, it was not received until May 11. In his speech, Penczek said:

"Today's Poland is full of hypocrisy, deceit and injustice, and any honest person will feel fearful. Marxists use superior force to suppress all other parties, and are heading towards a proletarian dictatorship.

"They say that the Polish Peasants' Party is reactionary. Their basis is that anyone who does not agree with dictatorship is reactionary. Even our boy scouts, they say are reactionary.

"What about our wartime sacrifices now? The average civilian feels that things are worse than before, because there is no hope of improvement ahead now. There is no rule of law, no security. In order to maintain its position, the government supports thousands of policemen, who do not ask what people are doing, only what ideas they believe in."

### Change in Japanese Thinking: No Longer Wanting Revenge on America; Report by Famous American Reporter Edgar Snow

Sakuuyama in Tochigi Prefecture, not far from Nikko, is located in the mountains of the Kogen Plateau. This land, like millions of other Japanese villages, can support four million farmers. They once supported Japan's war of aggression. These people never knew the reason for this war. They only knew to follow the opinions of the elders, not because they resented the Americans, but because they had been instilled with the doctrines of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism for centuries.

This village, like other Japanese villages, has no American military occupation. No farmer has ever spoken with an American. The people of Sakuuyama do not understand that Japan has been defeated, why it was defeated, and the meaning of the defeat. Children still regard the emperor as a god.

But now this village is questioning the facts of the past, the true purpose of the war, their government, and other political and social beliefs.

One night, we were sitting in the home of a Japanese man named Fukuhara, and asked the Japanese people present about the land reform law announced by MacArthur: "What do you think of the land reform law?" Everyone expressed their support.

I asked for their opinions on other MacArthur directives, saying "We are all very satisfied."

A Japanese monk named Mori suddenly interjected, saying: "I most approve of MacArthur's directive regarding freedom of religious belief and the prohibition of government subsidies for Shintoism. The Japanese are not all Shinto believers. In fact, ninety-nine out of one hundred are Buddhists."

A teacher in this village who is a Christian said: "The ban on dangerous thought laws is the best. We can now teach the truth and allow students to ask questions freely."

A middle-aged female teacher named Ozaki agreed with her colleague, saying: "We women are most pleased that the Americans have given us women's rights."

I asked: "Now that you have women's suffrage, who will you elect?" Ozaki felt a little dazed, "I don't know much about politics. I will participate in the election after I have learned it."

A man named Yanagisawa shouted: "What's the use of elections? All politicians are stupid and say one thing and do another."

I asked: "Do you think this is the reason for Japan's defeat?"

He replied: "That's right, it's because of corrupt officials."

Ms. Ando interjected: "The real reason is still the military, who deceived the emperor."

I asked: "Do you think the emperor should be responsible?"

Everyone seemed a little restrained when they heard the sacred word "emperor." I turned to the monk for his opinion. He did not think that the emperor should be held responsible for the mistakes made by those around him.

A Japanese woman who had lived abroad told me: "To implement democracy and gender equality in Japan, we must change our lifestyle. We must build houses of another style, wear clothes of another style, and implement democracy starting from within the family."

The price of rice paddies is limited by the government to 1,200 yen per acre, but other prices are not limited. A simple house costs 50,000 yen, a horse costs 10,000 yen, and a cow costs 25,000 yen. The current allocation of fertilizer only reaches 20% of the actual demand. They attribute this lack to the government. They have not thought that they themselves and their sons can improve this situation.

I heard that they recently organized a youth club. I asked: Is your club controlled by a certain political party? They replied: "There are no political parties in Sakuuyama. We have never participated in elections. We don't know if we are right-wing or left-wing. But sometimes we lean slightly towards the Socialist and Communist parties." The next night, eight local young people still wore beautiful kimonos to continue participating in the discussion. The most surprising thing was that six unmarried girls actually came alone to participate in this evening party. This was a phenomenon that had never happened before the war.

They asked about the length of the occupation of Japan, food, and foreign trade issues.

My friend and I immediately explained to them that the United States hopes to resolve all international disputes through peaceful means. The young people all looked relieved after hearing this. They all said in unison: "We don't need war." I asked: "Do you still want to take revenge on America?" Everyone, even the girls, said that they did not resent America and expressed their support for the current American policy towards Japan. Some young people still respect the emperor like their parents. But two people advocated abolishing the emperor. Many elders in the past told us that the emperor was as perfect as a god. Now that he is the same as us and cannot do more than us, we cannot expect him to bear greater responsibility than us. (Extracted and translated from the Saturday Evening Post)

### Five Years Later: Flying a Thousand Miles Per Hour; Penicillin Losing Effectiveness

The modern world is a world of high speed. Among all modern means of transportation, the fastest is of course the airplane. But human desires are endless, and what scientists are diligently researching today is to increase the speed of airplanes to the speed of sound (about 760 miles per hour at sea level) or higher. When today's airplanes fly too fast, the air does not have time to give way and shrinks into shock waves, hindering the lift of the aircraft. But scientists tell us that within three years, commercial airplanes carrying mail will fly across continents and oceans at a speed of 1,000 miles per hour. After a while, large passenger planes of the same speed may follow. At that time, the barrier limiting airplanes from exceeding the speed of sound will be broken.

The above is the prediction made by scientists at the Langley Research Center in Virginia, one of the world's largest aviation research institutions, after six years of research. The focus of their plan is to achieve supersonic flight speeds.

According to scientists engaged in this research, future supersonic aircraft will be more slender than current aircraft. The design of the wings can produce the effect of winged rockets.

Within five to ten years, penicillin and streptomycin will lose their effectiveness in treating diseases. This is the prediction made by Dr. Mauried, a therapist, at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology conference.

The reason is that bacteria are developing resistance to these two antibacterial agents, and soon doctors will use doses of these two antibacterial agents that are more than a thousand times higher than they are now. The only way to prevent penicillin or streptomycin from becoming ineffective is to avoid using them on patients when it is not necessary. Using penicillin tablets or pills will accelerate the arrival of the period when penicillin becomes ineffective in two situations: (1) the medication used is too weak; (2) penicillin is mistakenly used to treat diseases that cannot be cured by the drug.

When using penicillin or streptomycin, large doses should be used to kill bacteria, otherwise bacteria will gradually develop resistance to them. (Translated from the June issue of Science Digest by Xi)

### Germany's Two Worlds

(I) A Tour of the American Zones in Germany and Austria

The United States Army authorities recently invited fourteen reporters and editors to the American-administered areas of Germany and Austria for a short-term inspection to understand the true situation there. Mr. Moore, the director of the editorial department of the American "Newsweek" magazine, was also among those invited. The following is Mr. Moore's impressions after returning from the inspection.

Berlin: After leaving the airport in the center of Berlin, we saw the post-war scene of Berlin for the first time, with ruins and rubble everywhere, a scene of devastation.

The Allied forces deal with Berlin today in one of two ways. One is to draw a line on German territory, with the Soviet bloc of states formed by the Soviet Union and its vassal states on the east side of the line, and the British, American, and French bloc on the other side. Such a confrontational situation will inevitably lead to war. The other way is to form an economic system in Germany under appropriate control, allowing it to establish its so-called light industry rather than heavy industry. In this way, Germany can supply potassium carbonate, coal, and other raw materials to other European countries to contribute to the European economy. The difference between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is: the Soviet Union wants to turn Germany into an extremely weak federal state, hoping to gradually instill communism into the minds of the German people; Britain wants to turn Germany into a strong federal state; the United States' policy seems to favor a compromise.

The reporter had dinner with General Clay in an elegant club. The reporter said: "The German waitresses here are very beautiful, and they don't look like subordinates at all." Clay pointed to a girl and said: "That is a Countess. The social classes in Germany are completely equal now." Indeed, German society has changed completely, just like Berlin.

Munich: Many places here were heavily bombed, but not as tragic as Berlin. The suburbs are dotted with many small huts, where families who survived the catastrophe live. The reporter visited a guest house in the suburbs, which was the former residence of a Nazi party member, whose son who died in the war was buried in the garden.

The reporter and other inspectors visited the head of the German government in Bavaria, which was set up by the American army. We asked: "What do your German compatriots think of you? Do they see you as traitors?" "Yes, those who still harbor Nazi ideology do have this view, but those who really intend to transform Germany into a democratic country believe that our work is selfless."

Vienna: Vienna has wide roads, almost as lovely as Paris, and the bombing here was not as tragic as in German cities.

Under armed protection, we drove to the train station and boarded General Clark's special train. This special train belonged to Ribbentrop and was equipped with wireless telephones and other equipment. Along the way, the magnificent scenery of the Alps flowed by.

We visited the war criminal camp in Hallein, which was full of Black Guards. We chose a war criminal with a higher level of education as the subject of our conversation. This person spoke English, his mother was British, and his father was Austrian. He had done business in British Guiana. He believed that the Nazi philosophy of life and way of life were the only ways of life for Germany and Austria, so he specially rushed back from Guiana in 1935 to join the Nazi Party. The reporter asked him if he regretted it. His answer was "no," and he said he would do it again.

(II) A Sketch of the Head of the German Communist Party

Since the implementation of the Four-Power control of Germany, the Western powers have glimpsed the Soviet policy for the first time, especially the Soviet policy of forcibly merging the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party. At the same time, the Western powers have learned about the style of the leaders of the German Communist Party. This article is a sketch of the German Communist Party made by Mr. Donald, the Berlin branch manager of the American "Newsweek" weekly magazine.

On May 8, 1945, when the Supreme Command of the Eastern German Forces unconditionally surrendered to Marshal Zhukov of the Soviet Union in Berlin, two Germans sat face to face in that conference room: one was Nazi Commander-in-Chief Marshal Keitel, and the other was German Communist leader Ulbricht. Ulbricht had a sinister smile on his face, because he was already destined to be a pillar of the German Communist Party.

Ulbricht compared himself to the German Lenin in private conversations, but in terms of position, he was only the third giant of the Socialist Unity Party. The party was nominally led by Communist leader Pieck and Social Democratic leader Grotewohl. But behind them, Ulbricht was planning and scheming. He was the party's strategist and also the most powerful speaker and propagandist, directly under the command of the Soviet Army Headquarters in Germany and the Moscow government.

Ulbricht was born in Leipzig in 1893, the son of a tailor. At the age of fifteen, he became a carpenter's apprentice. After joining the Socialist Party in 1912, he was very active in the left-wing alliance until Hitler came to power. He joined the German Communist Party in 1918, served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party, and was elected as a representative of Potsdam to the German Parliament in 1928.

After Hitler came to power in 1933, Ulbricht slipped to Austria. The following year, he fled to Prague in Czechoslovakia, and in 1935 he arrived in Moscow. Since then, he has not seen Germany again until the spring of 1945, when he returned to China to serve as an advisor to Marshal Zhukov's staff.

When Ulbricht returned to Berlin, he had various lists hidden in his pocket, such as who should be surrounded, who should occupy important positions, and a plan to establish four anti-fascist parties. He served as Marshal Zhukov's personal translator. He had a special car, motorcycle, and plane so that he could inspect the Soviet military zone at any time and travel between Berlin and Moscow. His car was often accompanied by a neatly dressed adjutant. But his office was located in a humble Red Army headquarters so that he could come into contact with the lower classes.

While in the Soviet Union, Ulbricht not only studied Lenin's doctrine but also tried to imitate his appearance. He had a natural bald head, and now he also grew a Lenin-style beard. Although he did not have Lenin's oratorical talent, he tried to study his speaking techniques.

Ulbricht often explained the purpose of the Soviet reparation policy to German civilians. In mid-April, he gave a speech in Leipzig, stating firmly that the movement of materials as compensation would be stopped from May Day as a special favor to the German working class. However, the movement of materials is still continuing. Whether Ulbricht deceived the German people or the Soviet Union changed its policy is unknown.

### Curious News: Moving Roads

In the cities of tomorrow, when you go from the countryside to the market town, you only need to call an anti-gravity air car, or step on a moving sidewalk to reach your destination.

Soviet engineers are determined to innovate transportation methods. Although air cars are still in the design stage, moving sidewalks have already started in Kiev. The inventor Volberg is also the designer of the Kiev underground escalator. He hopes that the moving sidewalk will be available to the public in 1947. This moving sidewalk has a special feature: pedestrians only need to step onto a slowly moving small road, and then change from this road to another road, and finally take you to your destination.

This is simply the "magic carpet" in "Arabian Nights."

When you are ironing clothes, the phone rings, or an accident suddenly happens in the house, you leave the iron on the table. When you come back ten minutes later, the lining cloth on the table has been burned. This kind of event can be completely avoided in the future. Recently, a new type of ironing board cover has been invented, which is made of glass that cannot burn, scorch, or wrinkle. With this thing, you no longer have to carefully stand the iron up or place it on a metal rack.

### The Devastated Berlin During the war, Berlin was bombed almost every day, and there were no complete houses in the city. The picture shows the German people cleaning up rubble and garbage under the command of the Allied forces.

### At present, Japan lacks everything, but the children are the enlightenment of the earth. They are the only surplus materials in the Orient.

Spring and Autumn

### The Art of Living

— Luo Hong

I often hear people talk about the art of living. Yes, a person in this troubled world should indeed pay attention to the art of living to adjust and obtain some pleasure in life. So, some people love to plant flowers, some people love to drink heavily, and some people like to talk with close friends in front of flowers and under the moon. Recently, I saw Qingge's several essays "Smoke," "Wine," and "Tea." She compared smoke to a lamp, a lamp symbolizing light; wine to a mirror, a mirror exposing the truth; and tea to a lady, a gentle and elegant lady! She often sits alone at night, sipping tea and thinking, letting all kinds of troubles flow to the east, as if she is in heaven! Hearing about other people's art of living, I feel that I am really the most vulgar of vulgar things. I neither smoke nor drink. Although I like flowers, I am not good at planting them, and I may not even be able to say a characteristic of what kind of beauty each flower has. I saw an article "Spring Flowers and Plants" in the third issue of "Live Era," which compared the nature and appearance of spring flowers and plants in various ways. It was very pleasant to listen to. At least in admiring flowers and plants, it can be said that she has deeply understood the art of living. Often, someone takes out a cigarette case and asks me if I smoke. I always shake my head with a smile. At that time, people will definitely say: "Why don't you smoke? When a person is writing, smoke is the best companion." Almost everyone says this, and of course I have to admit that this sentence is completely correct. But I never use smoke to arouse thoughts and help writing. The reason is very simple: first, I don't write much, and I haven't accumulated enough experience to develop this habit, and when I start writing an article, I already have an outline. My conception is that every time I have free time, I sit alone, staring blankly at the floating clouds outside the window, making the outline of a novel appear. Sometimes, I absent-mindedly pick up any book or a picture, and as I look at it, my thoughts actually drift away, slowly drifting away, and I have part of an outline for my novel. This outline is not perfect enough, not clear enough, so I come back to this kind of blank thinking again. Also, because of the busy life, I am not allowed to be in a daze all the time. Here I must explain that I am not fabricating my novel in a "dazed" reverie. When I need to conceive the outline of a novel in a daze, the theme of the novel has already been obtained in a certain real-life experience or some feeling. As for writing, I don't have a fixed time, allowing me to brew a pot of good tea, light a cigarette, and make the personality of the characters more concrete from the smoke rings, and organize the story of the novel more closely. I write, often when I have free time, and maybe something will come to bother me, and I have to stop writing. Perhaps because the outline in my heart is already quite clear, even if I am interrupted, I can still continue writing most of the time when I pick up the pen.

I don't have much connection with wine either. I blush after drinking half a glass of wine, which really makes me a little daunted by wine. Although I can't drink myself, I like to accompany my friends to drink. I advocate that those who can drink should drink as much as they can, and those who can't drink can use tea or other things instead.

In fact, upon careful analysis, my lack of connection with tobacco and alcohol is still because life does not allow it. A married woman has to deal with housework and take care of children, and time is deprived of a part, and you can't arrange it anymore. Therefore, in my life process, I am often fighting for time. Occasionally, I have the opportunity to sit alone leisurely, and I can't help but laugh secretly at my attitude towards life. Often, between every move, it shows a kind of haste, trying to save time and use it in a more useful place.

So, I can't talk about the art of living, and I become the most vulgar and unbearable person.

### Mrs. Juanzi

— Zhong Yuan

The first time I saw Mrs. Juanzi was one spring evening ten years ago.

It was a small banquet held by our venerable Principal Li to celebrate Mrs. Li's sixtieth birthday. Qi Ying and I, as the president and vice-president of the senior class, were also invited. That evening, amidst the clinking of glasses, I saw a woman sitting across from Qi Ying, around forty years old. She was slender, with a pale face and black-rimmed glasses on her nose. She wore a gray qipao, and her demeanor was quiet and gentle, with nothing particularly remarkable. However, as the banquet ended and the guests dispersed, Qi Ying suddenly pointed to the woman's back and whispered in my ear:

"Look! That Japanese woman!"

"Japanese woman?" I was surprised.

"Don't you know her? Her life story is quite pitiful!..."

Qi Ying led me along a row of lush green hollies towards the dormitory. The lights-out bell had already rung, and everything was quiet, with only a pale yellow crescent moon hanging obliquely in the sky. Qi Ying quietly told me that this Japanese woman was a neighbor of her aunt's family, named "Juanzi," and everyone called her "Mrs. Juanzi." In her youth, she worked as a nurse in a hospital in Tokyo. She fell in love with a Chinese student, and despite her family's opposition, married him and came to China with him. However, happiness was short-lived. Soon after arriving in China, the student died. She was heartbroken and vowed never to remarry or return to her country. She adopted a Chinese child as her son, and for twenty years, she lived a lonely and desolate life on the income from her husband's remaining farmland. Now her son has grown up and married, but her life is still bitter and lonely.

"Like that crescent moon, hanging alone in the sky. The crescent moon will soon become full again, but for her! She will never have a day of reunion!" Qi Ying ended the story with a long sigh. I understood her; perhaps she was remembering her lover who died two years ago, and therefore felt particularly sympathetic to this Japanese woman's plight. So I smiled and said to her:

"You and she are in the same boat, aren't you?"

"Not necessarily! But Mrs. Juanzi's situation is indeed very pitiful. I heard that her son and daughter-in-law don't treat her well. Her only friend is our principal's wife, but that is just a very formal relative relationship!"

Qi Ying wanted to continue, but we had already entered the dormitory. We lived on different floors, each in our own room. After that, everyone was busy with graduation exams, busy looking for jobs, and no one cared about an irrelevant Japanese woman!

We graduated. Like birds released from a warm house, we flapped our wings and flew to different places. My destination was an old elementary school. It was a clear early autumn morning, and I was sitting in a quiet office for the first time, looking curiously at several unfamiliar male and female colleagues. Suddenly, I couldn't help but shout:

"Mrs. Juanzi!"

Of course, I was a bit abrupt, but I couldn't be mistaken. The slender figure, pale face, black-rimmed glasses, gray qipao—who else could it be?

She was sitting at a desk by the window. Hearing my shout, she looked up in surprise, as if searching for the source of the sound. When her eyes landed on my face, she suddenly smiled slightly. I could see even more clearly that it was an extremely beautiful smile, a smile with a strong attraction, but sadly, the beauty had aged!

"I recognize you; we ate together once," her voice was very gentle.

"Yes, I am a graduate of Aiguang Girls' High School," I told her.

"Did Principal Li's wife introduce you to teach here?"

"Yes."

I never expected that Mrs. Juanzi would not only be my colleague but also share a dormitory with me. She had been working at this elementary school in hygiene and general affairs for three years. However, as Qi Ying said, her life was truly bleak and lonely. She rarely spoke and rarely interacted with people. The first night I sat with her in the dormitory, I wanted to try to talk to her, but she only smiled at me and said nothing. Later, I was sitting at my desk reading when I suddenly heard a series of shuffling sounds behind me. Turning my head, I was stunned: her gray qipao was off, and a Japanese woman wearing a kimono and wooden clogs appeared before me!

A kind of inexplicable feeling sent shivers down my spine. The next day, I asked the principal to move me to a different dormitory.

After that, although Mrs. Juanzi and I still saw each other every day, we only greeted each other and didn't talk much. Therefore, I still knew nothing about her circumstances—and, of course, seemed to have no desire to know.

Living in the laughter of children, a year passed easily. The sound of cannons at the Lugou Bridge rang out, and the flames of war blazed across the sky. Amidst frequent alarms, the school was dismissed, and organizations such as the "Anti-Japanese Support Association" and the "Air Defense and Rescue Team" sprang up like mushrooms. After a bomb at the Great World, Qi Ying and several classmates hurriedly fled back from Shanghai. They invited me to join the propaganda team of the county's Anti-Japanese Support Association, and I agreed. So, I was assigned every day to sit by a radio and record news reports, while Qi Ying and the others worked outside.

One drizzly dusk, I had just finished recording the third news briefing from the Central Radio Station when suddenly there were two "tap-tap" sounds on the door. I thought my colleague Mr. Wang had come to get the news report, but when I opened the door, it was not Mr. Wang who came in, but Mrs. Juanzi!

"Ah, it's you!..." I was so surprised that I couldn't speak.

"Yes, Miss Zhang, long time no see. I came to see you!..." After saying that, she smiled at me, but I saw that it was no longer a beautiful and moving smile, but an extremely unnatural, forced smile. This smile frightened me. I asked her to sit down, poured her a cup of tea, and said nothing.

Finally, she explained her intentions. It turned out she had come to ask me about the war news.

"The news is posted on the streets every day; haven't you seen it?" I asked her.

"I have seen it, but I want to know some real news."

"Real news?" Did she think the news we posted on the streets was fake? I felt a little bit angry. She was very sensitive and seemed to notice it, so she immediately changed the subject and asked me:

"Miss Zhang, many people here are already fleeing. Are you also preparing to flee?"

"If the Japanese soldiers invade, of course, we have to flee!"

After hearing my words, she smiled unnaturally again. Suddenly, she walked over strangely, grabbed my hand, and said softly, "Miss Zhang, you shouldn't flee! The Japanese soldiers are good; they won't kill ordinary people!"

"What are you saying?" I violently shook off her hand, my face flushed with anger.

The conversation obviously could not continue. She said goodbye, but when she stepped out the door and bowed deeply to me, I saw a teardrop clinging to her glasses.

That night was some day in October of the 26th year of the Republic of China [1937]. There were no old newspapers. Qi Ying came back early, and we talked about Mrs. Juanzi under the lamp. Qi Ying still thought that this lonely Japanese woman was "pitiful," while I thought she was "detestable." Finally, Qi Ying asked me, "If you were a Japanese woman, and you married a Chinese husband, and your husband died, leaving you alone in China with no relatives, no one loving you, and even your son and daughter-in-law hostile to you, what would you do?"

I couldn't answer. So, Qi Ying laughed. A laugh that ended a small argument, ended a drizzly night, and ended a series of dark and tense days.

"The Japanese soldiers have finally landed in Jinshan Bay!"

When this terrible news came, the entire small city was plunged into chaos. The "Anti-Japanese Support Association," the "Air Defense and Rescue Team," and whatever other organizations—although they had not officially disbanded—were each hiring boats and packing their bags. Large numbers of people scattered overnight.

Qi Ying fled to the Shanghai Concession with her family, and I fled to the nearby countryside with my family. In the panic and chaos, of course, no one remembered that irrelevant Japanese woman, Mrs. Juanzi!

However, a year later, after wandering from the countryside to Shanghai, and finding myself destitute in Shanghai, I had no choice but to return to the occupied small city. The first thing that caught my attention was: Mrs. Juanzi had become rich!

Mrs. Juanzi had become a translator for the Japanese military police; a consultant to the "Peace Preservation Association"; the chairman of the "Japan-China Mining Company"; and also held many other high positions that I couldn't even begin to understand!

Not only had Mrs. Juanzi herself become rich, but her son had also become rich. He had become the vice-chairman of the "Peace Preservation Association," the director of the "Tax Bureau," and the general manager of the "Luguang Foreign Company." And not only had Mrs. Juanzi's son become rich, but she had also promoted many unknown nobodies, such as Chen Liansheng, who had been an apprentice at a Japanese barbershop in Hongkou, and Zhou Alin, who had worked as a tea server in a Japanese hospital. Through her introduction and recommendation, they had all become smartly dressed in suits and were remarkably arrogant.

Of course, all these things were told to me by several old colleagues. I personally saw the wealthy Mrs. Juanzi on the afternoon of the Gregorian New Year, when my elementary school hosted several distinguished school board guests.

Mrs. Juanzi was no longer a hygiene teacher and general affairs clerk, but a dignified school board member and a "distinguished guest." She stepped out of a shiny chauffeured car, wearing a new-style gray broadcloth overcoat over her slender body. She walked slowly, and when she reached the stone steps in front of the reception room, she saw me and several old colleagues standing there and nodded slightly before walking inside.

Mrs. Juanzi seemed somewhat proud, but when she came out after the banquet, she suddenly walked up to me, called out "Miss Zhang," and asked me, "Do you know the address of Principal Li and his wife?"

"Principal Li and his wife have gone to the interior," I told her.

"Gone to the interior? Ah, why did they go to the interior? There are many things to do here..." She frowned, looking somewhat disappointed, and said nothing more.

With a "ding," Mrs. Juanzi and many "distinguished guests" got into their chauffeured cars and left. I watched them go, feeling a sense of inexplicable pain in my heart.

Winter solstice, spring, ... time flew by like a rocket, and the war spread wildly.

Asia, Europe, and finally the vast Pacific Ocean were engulfed in an unprecedented conflagration.

The iron hooves of the brutal Japanese trampled over half of China. Under those hooves, millions of compatriots died, were displaced, and gasped for breath... but under those hooves, Mrs. Juanzi's status and position increased day by day.

Although the brutal Japanese had always regarded women as slaves, Mrs. Juanzi, with her decades of experience in China, her fluent and skillful Chinese, and her loyalty to the "Emperor," was trusted and valued by the Japanese. Moreover, because Mrs. Juanzi had promoted countless nobodies and recommended many Mr. Zhangs and Young Masters Li, countless red and green "new nobles" did their best to flatter and fawn over her. However, the most valuable thing about Mrs. Juanzi was that because she had some gentle and kind nature, she sometimes helped our wronged compatriots, and therefore often received praise from our compatriots who had suffered injustice.

"Roosevelt is Jewish, so he is so cruel! Alas! So many people have died; how pitiful!" It is said that once, when Mrs. Juanzi said this to a Chinese neighbor, tears streamed down her face.

But Mrs. Juanzi was happy. She was no longer a lonely crescent moon. Her Chinese daughter-in-law now treated her better than the Empress Dowager, and her Japanese family no longer looked down on her for marrying a Chinese man. They had even traveled from Tokyo to China twice to visit her.

Mrs. Juanzi was happy. On Sunday afternoons, when I and several colleagues were strolling on the street, we often saw her stepping out of a chauffeured car at the entrance of the Japanese military police, looking up at the rising sun flag fluttering on the roof. A strange light appeared on her pale face, and she smiled, smiling enthusiastically under the blood-red rising sun flag!

Mrs. Juanzi smiled under the rising sun flag for eight whole years!

But finally, one day, with a crash, Mrs. Juanzi cried!

Mrs. Juanzi cried. It was one day in September of last year. Just as we were overjoyed and excitedly carrying two large packages, she suddenly appeared in the reception room of our elementary school. She was talking to the principal. I heard these few sentences: "I have lived here for thirty years. I will never go back to Japan!..." "I have saved many Chinese prisoners..." "They can kill me if they want!..." Saying this, she wept softly!

The blood-red rising sun flag, a moment of glory, a dream! Mrs. Juanzi had fallen into a dark and terrifying abyss!

But fortunately, our magnanimous authorities, after investigating and confirming that Mrs. Juanzi was indeed Japanese and had indeed helped several Chinese people, did not make things difficult for her at all, but only asked her to donate a sum of "contribution money," and then gave her freedom.

Not only freedom, but after the school reopened this spring, Mrs. Juanzi actually returned to the school to work in hygiene again.

Pale face, slender figure, black-rimmed glasses, gray qipao; everything had returned to its original state, except that she seemed even more bleak and lonely. Sometimes when my colleagues and I were chatting in the office, happily talking about the world events we had read about in the newspapers, as soon as she heard us talking about these things, she would immediately stand up and angrily walk out.

Mrs. Juanzi lived in the west building of the dormitory. One night when the moon was bright, suddenly a series of intermittent sobs drifted from the west building. This sound made me and several colleagues uncomfortable. Everyone said, "How pitiful. Let's go comfort her!" So, we all rushed to Mrs. Juanzi's door, but when the door opened, a wide kimono and a pair of wooden clogs appeared before us. Everyone shivered at the same time, and no one could say a word.

Yesterday, Qi Ying wrote from Shanghai, asking if Mrs. Juanzi was well. Now I am writing back to her, saying: "Mrs. Juanzi is very well, but—"...

I can't write any more. I feel a sense of helpless sorrow!

The flames of war have been extinguished, and hatred has ended. But when, and by what means, can we forget that terrible memory of fire and pull out the sharp root of hatred?

### Jiang Hanting's Flowers and Birds

### To Friends on the Lake

— Tian Di

I have just come from the mountains and rivers of Bashan and Shu. Before I have even unpacked my luggage or shaken off the dust of the journey, I am pouring out the accumulated sincerity of my heart to friends on the lake whom I have never met, as a gesture of respect.

Although the scenery and culture here are unfamiliar to me, the words Hangzhou and West Lake have long been deeply imprinted in my mind, just as the names of some friends on the lake are very familiar to me. Speaking of which, the story is too long. In my childhood, in the family life I spent leisurely all day long, I heard my elders praising Hangzhou and praising the beauty and tranquility of West Lake. Later, with the westward migration of the Nationalist government, growing up in the midst of gunfire, I occasionally heard news from the southeast. My concern for West Lake and Hangzhou increased with the passing years. Especially when I thought about the historical sites on the lake that made people linger, were they still intact? Under the trampling of enemy hooves, how much more did I yearn to be like a strong hawk, flying over mountains and crossing rivers, flying far away to soar in the sky over ancient Lin'an, and then suddenly flashing over the calm, mirror-like surface of West Lake? Today, this wish has finally been realized. Shouldn't I be able to roar a few times, like a monkey, singing the praises of my own battles and calling out to my companions?

But I have not forgotten that the five thousand-plus li of smooth road from Chongqing to Hangzhou was watered by the blood of millions of soldiers and civilians. Nor have I neglected that the road stretching out before me is still a long and arduous one! Therefore, I have not become ecstatic like ordinary dignitaries and merchants. With tears in my eyes, I remain silent, carefully examining the mountains and rivers of the lake after the catastrophe and the humiliated people. I think to myself, "What efforts must I make to ensure that these beautiful mountains and rivers are never persecuted again?"

For a cultural worker like me, who is so poor that I have no place to stand, raising such a question would cause anyone to shake their head and be dismissed as a damper on the scenery, right? With a burning heart, I walked out of the city gate, tearfully saying goodbye to foggy Chongqing, always thinking that in the vast recovered lands, the "old" had been destroyed, and the "new" would be easy to build. Who knew that, God knows, my eyes did not deceive me. In the rain-shrouded, broken, and lifeless Yichang, in the desolate and deserted Shashi, in the rice-famine-ridden and war-cloud-covered Hankou, in the dust-filled Nanjing, in the decadent and extravagant Shanghai, I now also see this tranquil and silent Hangzhou! All of this made me weep bitterly. I regretted that I had not distrusted the reports on the situation in the recovered areas by my colleagues from major newspapers in Chongqing last August. No wonder I would weep bitterly.

However, I will never be discouraged. I know that in this situation where everything is in ruins and everything is without direction, there are many people who are only focused on "grabbing" in troubled waters, but there are also quite a few who are working seriously. Taking cultural work as an example, if no one takes it seriously, cultural traitors can roam free and no one will expose them. But it is undeniable that the current level of effort in cultural work is still insufficient. Otherwise, how could pornographic publications sell so easily, and how could obscene writings be so bold in their incitement to lust and crime? Cultural work has always been at the forefront, leading the entire social thought. If cultural work is like this, let alone other areas.

Therefore, I must make a request of my friends in the cultural world. We must face reality and work hard to fulfill our responsibilities for the great cause of nation-building! What should be "praised" and what should be "criticized" at the moment, we can faithfully report with an impartial pen, so that good people are encouraged and traitors and villains are deterred. Similarly, we must also intensify our own cultivation, so that our cultural work can truly shift from a point-by-point movement to a comprehensive unfolding, popular, accessible, standing on the position of the nation and the people, so that the future "literary movement" can continue the good style of the "May Fourth" era—democracy and science—and embark on a more glorious and healthier path.

If we put in a little more effort, we can make the social atmosphere a little better. As the saying goes, "Ghosts can't stand the sun." As long as our "pen force" is strong and effective, and we can truly fulfill our responsibility of promoting new culture and transforming social atmosphere, those boring pornographic texts and [obscenities], although they cannot immediately "disappear without a trace," will gradually be scorned by the world and eventually die. However, it should not be underestimated that this will also require a series of arduous battles. Moreover, "to radiate sunshine to others, one must first have sunshine oneself," right?

We can no longer remain silent, no longer be like a plate of loose sand, because "common aspirations" can "build a city." All cultural friends who are loyal to reality, loyal to the nation and the people, and loyal to their own conscience should automatically join hands to make these silent mountains and rivers have a lively life and vitality—I am entering the circle of friends with such a determination, even though I am "dressed in rags" and we do not know each other.

Originally, these things were already well known to my friends. Here, I timidly offer them, only wanting to ask everyone to review them, and at the same time consider it a gesture of respect before meeting. Finally, I offer my deepest blessings for our common tomorrow!

Long serial novel

### Double Flight, Double Stay (57)

— Zhao Qingge

The boss cannot understand the boss's wife's psychology. He knows her temperament, but he never thought she was such an unjust and vicious woman! He sees her as selfish and narrow-minded, but he thinks this is unavoidable for most women. Therefore, he always forgives her and constantly advises her.

"You can't say that. It's okay to ask her to do things, but don't ask her to do things that are too strenuous. After all, she's still young! Also, I think she's wearing too little. It's so cold. Make her another cotton-padded coat!" Boss Liao said worriedly.

"Mind your own business! This is the daughter-in-law's affair; the father-in-law has no say in the daughter-in-law's affair." The boss's wife stopped Boss Liao as if she was angry.

"Fine! I won't interfere; you can handle it!" Boss Liao also became sulky and stopped talking.

From then on, the boss's wife harbored even more resentment towards Xiao Hong. She suspected that Xiao Hong had complained to Boss Liao, so she intensified her abuse of Xiao Hong.

Besides Boss Liao, Bao Ling was the only one who sympathized with Xiao Hong because he saw Xiao Hong suffer with his own eyes. He had secretly helped her, going out to buy groceries for her in the morning and washing dishes for her in the kitchen. He regarded Xiao Hong as someone with the same fate as himself, perhaps Xiao Hong was even worse off than him! He was just an employee of the Huichun Tang, and he could leave the Huichun Tang at any time, but Xiao Hong was more miserable than him! She was a donkey that had been sold to the Liao family forever! She could never leave the Liao family. He no longer had the same attitude of watching a play towards Xiao Hong as before. He felt pity and indignation for Xiao Hong's cruel fate! He was experiencing this kind of pain for the first time! He felt that seeing others suffer was more painful than suffering himself! He couldn't understand why there were such unfair events between people? He told Liao Dong about this, but Liao Dong showed no reaction, and he didn't seem to understand anything. He even complained that Xiao Hong had walked into a trap herself! He had no feelings for Xiao Hong, nor could he have any. He had never even looked at Xiao Hong. In his mind, he had no relationship with Xiao Hong, so he had never paid attention to Xiao Hong's life.

"Don't help me anymore. Help Xiao Hong; she's so pitiful." Bao Ling often said this to Liao Dong.

"No way! I don't want to bother with her. Who told her to ask for trouble, letting her parents send her into the tiger's mouth?" Liao Dong replied to Bao Ling indifferently. For some reason, he had always felt a kind of resentment towards Xiao Hong.

Bao Ling had no way to make Liao Dong sympathize with Xiao Hong like himself, so he could only continue to help Xiao Hong himself.

Recently, the boss's wife suddenly came up with another economical idea. Because it was cold these days, cooking rice required burning firewood, and heating the fire required burning charcoal, both of which cost too much. So, she had a flash of inspiration and ordered Xiao Hong to go outside the city every afternoon to collect firewood, so that a sum of money could be saved on firewood for cooking every day.

Naturally, Xiao Hong could only obey. Every afternoon, she would take a carrying pole and a rope, go to the wilderness outside the city to collect firewood. After collecting enough to make two bundles, she would carry them home and then start cooking dinner. If she didn't do well even once and returned home, the boss's wife would scold her for being incompetent and useless!

One day, it was extremely cold! Heavy snow was falling in the sky, the north wind was howling, and the cold was piercing to the bone! After eating lunch, Xiao Hong took the carrying pole and rope, wrapped a black cloth around her head, put on a pair of torn cotton shoes, and walked towards the desolate suburbs outside the city on the slippery road.
