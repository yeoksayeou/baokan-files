### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Marshall, Two-Hour Meeting and Lunch Together

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] After returning to Nanjing last night, Chairman Chiang went directly to his official residence at the military academy to rest. He did not receive any guests, but he did receive Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, and Chen Cheng, with whom he spoke for about an hour. It is reported that at 10:35 AM on the 4th, Special Envoy Marshall visited the Chairman and had a conversation for about two hours, after which they had lunch together. The content of the conversation was not disclosed, but according to sources close to Marshall, this was the first time Marshall had met with the Chairman after returning to Nanjing, and they had a long and in-depth conversation. It is believed that both sides discussed the urgent issues of receiving sovereignty over the Northeast, restoring full transportation, reorganizing and unifying the military, and strengthening the authority of the Executive Headquarters execution groups, all of which are matters of national concern. This day is also the Dragon Boat Festival, and Marshall has been studying Chinese history and folklore extensively, so his conversation with the Chairman touched on the historical significance of this festival, revealing a feeling of profound nostalgia for the past and present. It is also reported that after receiving Marshall, the Chairman also received government representatives to listen to their reports.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] After Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, an atmosphere of peaceful negotiation permeated the capital. However, opinions differ on how to resolve the Northeast issue. Some say that Zhou Enlai and Marshall exchanged views on various issues during their conversation yesterday, and that on one particular issue, the CCP politely declined the US side's right to make the final decision, insisting that Chairman Chiang should make the final decision. This kind of argument has been seen frequently recently, but because its wording is simple and its meaning unclear, the general reader feels confused. According to a neutral source who spoke to our newspaper reporter, it is indeed necessary for all current issues to be left to the Chairman's decision, but one principle must be made clear: that Chairman Chiang is earnestly expected to make the final decision on all issues related to the peaceful acceptance of sovereignty in the Northeast, the restoration of transportation, and the reorganization and unification of the military, based on national policy. Once this principle is clarified, the situation can be expected to become clearer. Otherwise, even if Su and Zhang were resurrected, the discussion would only become more and more confused, and ultimately fruitless.

[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] General Marshall visited Chairman Chiang this morning and began discussions at 11:00 AM, which lasted for three hours. It is generally believed that Marshall directly raised the issue of peace or war with Chairman Chiang. Afterwards, Marshall began a long conversation with Zhou Enlai, which lasted until the evening. Some sources believe that the issue of peace or war will be decided within a few hours. It is generally believed that Marshall's secretary's peace plan is flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances. Neutral parties believe that Marshall can balance the demands of both the KMT and the CCP.

### National Government Memorial Week; Chief of General Staff Chen Reports

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng attended the National Government Memorial Week on the 4th and gave a military report, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) Military Reorganization: The National Army currently has 89 infantry corps, 239 divisions (including 3 youth army corps and 8 divisions, excluding the CCP's 115th, 120th, and 129th divisions), 2 cavalry corps, and 13 brigades. From March of this year to the end of February next year, these should be reorganized into 30 infantry corps (90 divisions) and 10 cavalry brigades. The surplus officers and soldiers will be discharged or transferred. The reorganization and demobilization of the above troops will be carried out in two steps. The first step is to reduce each corps by one-third, that is, the original corps with three divisions and nine regiments will be reduced to a division with three brigades and six regiments, and the original corps with two divisions and six regiments will be reduced to a division with two brigades and four regiments. All independent divisions will be reorganized into independent brigades with two regiments. The second step will be implemented in accordance with the basic plan signed by the Military Tripartite Group, but after the 90 divisions are formed according to the prescribed establishment, they should be gradually formed into 30 corps, each corps with three divisions, and gradually introduced to the designated locations as stipulated in the basic plan. The reorganization work of the first step will be carried out in three phases. The first phase involves reorganizing the troops along the Longhai Railway and in the northwest (excluding Xinjiang Hexi), totaling 27 corps and 66 divisions, from March to the end of April. The second phase involves reorganizing the troops along the Yangtze River and south of the Yangtze River, totaling 32 corps and 92 divisions, from May 1 to the end of June. The third phase will begin on July 1, and the plan will be determined separately. After the reorganization of the first step is completed, the reorganization of the second step will continue. The method is as follows: each infantry division will be reorganized into 90 divisions in accordance with the formal establishment, each division with two brigades and four regiments, totaling 14,000 people, and each corps headquarters with approximately 6,300 people. The starting date of the reorganization of each corps and division must be determined by the Executive Headquarters, approximately 8 to 9 corps will be reorganized each month, and its establishment will be determined separately. In North China, a total of 7 corps must be formed into one corps in accordance with the prescribed establishment before September 1 of this year, so as to be combined with the CCP troops into a group army in the seventh month (i.e., September of this year). The other 6 corps can be formed separately later, and three of them are designated to be combined with the CCP troops into a group army.

(2) Establishment of the Ministry of National Defense: The reorganization of the original central military institutions has begun, and the original business of these institutions has been transferred to the Ministry of National Defense for continued handling. The Ministry of National Defense was formally established on June 1. Regarding the reorganization of military institutions, Chairman Chiang gave three instructions before returning to the capital: (1) It is hoped that all levels of generals will take the national interest as the premise, and that the adjustment of military institutions is absolutely necessary based on the current and future needs of the country. (2) The reorganization of military institutions is based entirely on the military organization and system of the United States. (3) The reorganization should be completed before the end of May this year.

There are four legislative principles of the Ministry of National Defense:

First, to govern the military with politics. According to the experience of past wars, governing the military with politics is the most appropriate for the application of national policy and the implementation of national defense. This concept is particularly prevalent in Britain and the United States. This reorganization of military institutions, the abolition of the Military Affairs Commission, which was separated from the administration, and the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, is in line with this idea.

Second, to return the military to the state. Returning the military to the state is a consistent policy of our party. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense is to implement this policy. Our country will soon implement democratic constitutionalism, and it is even more unacceptable for military institutions to be separated from the administrative system and independent.

Third, to unify the command of the army, navy, and air force. In modern warfare, the strategy and tactics of the military itself have constituted the unity of the army, navy, and air force. Moreover, as a result of motorization dominating military affairs, the suddenness of war is extremely great. In order to deal with emergency measures, the military administration and military orders of the army, navy, and air force must be unified. This reorganization of national defense institutions is to adopt this system.

Fourth, the organization of the Ministry of National Defense. The head of state concurrently serves as the Grand Marshal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in wartime, so this organization is applicable in both war and peacetime, so that there will be no confusion due to sudden wars. This reform has four spirits and is to establish a century-old system and lay the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country. The Ministry of National Defense also has two characteristics: (1) The division of powers and functions: all "powers" of the military are in the hands of the government, while the military's professional "capabilities" belong to the military department. (2) The concrete manifestation of the three-link system: the Ministry of National Defense represents the government and has the power to supervise, the General Staff Headquarters plans and guides, and the General Headquarters is responsible for implementation. This fully demonstrates the spirit of the three-link administrative system.

The reorganization of the original military institutions into the Ministry of National Defense is implemented in three stages. In the first stage, the unfinished business of the original institutions will continue to be handled by the original institutions. In the second stage, the new institutions will be reorganized and merged in accordance with the new organizational structure. In the third stage, the new institutions will officially start their business. As for the staff of the original institutions, in addition to being incorporated into the new institutions as much as possible, the surplus staff will be properly arranged, and the detailed method will be the same as the demobilization and resettlement method of the troops. (To be continued)

### Chairman Chiang Cares about the Treatment of Civil Servants

It is reported that this case will be finalized at the National Defense Supreme Council meeting held on the 5th. According to sources, the Chairman is extremely concerned about this case and advocates for a reasonable adjustment.

### Chairman's Broadcast Address to the Youth Army (Continued)

In addition to cultivating habits of order and discipline, life training also aims to develop our virtue of hard work and endurance. The revolutionary cause is originally a cause of saving people and the world. Revolutionaries must not hesitate to relieve the suffering of others at the expense of their own suffering, and to seek the happiness of others at the expense of their own happiness. If we can endure the pain that ordinary people cannot endure, and undertake the work that ordinary people cannot undertake, then we will not be ashamed of being revolutionary cadres. All of you, my young men, as long as you study the development of our National Revolution, you can know that the victory of our Anti-Japanese War today is entirely due to the struggle out of hard work, endurance, risk-taking, and difficulty. When our revolutionary army was in the 15th year of the Republic of China, it was able to defeat warlords from all provinces of the country who were hundreds of times stronger than us with a small number of troops and inferior equipment. It was by relying on this revolutionary aspiration to save the country, and the sincere dedication to sacrifice and fight for the Three Principles of the People and for the nation that we achieved victory. This is not only the case for the success of the army, but also for the success of individuals. If you look at the children of wealthy families, who cannot endure hardship, work hard, be thrifty, and simple, but only seek enjoyment and ease, in the end, which one can achieve results? From this, we can know that if a person wants to succeed in his career, he must be able to endure hardship, work hard, take risks, ask only for work, and not count the rewards. Especially you young men, you are only in your twenties and thirties, and fortunately, you can participate in the revolutionary ranks today, so you must regard saving the country and saving the people as your duty, regard hard work as your right, and regard endurance as your duty. If we do not do this, but only count the rewards and seek enjoyment, then we will certainly be eliminated by the times. Everyone knows that the United States is now the richest and strongest country in the world, and President Truman has recently asked his people to tighten their belts and save food to promote it. The youth of our country are all undergoing military training, and our China is such a poor and weak country, and the economic and production capacity is so backward. If our youth can no longer endure hardship, work hard, be thrifty, and simple, how can we 희수면戈一介一, 世代有, and how can we survive in the modern international arena.

The above is to explain the importance of life training for a person's success. Now I also want to pass on my personal experience to all my young men. At the age of 21, I was admitted to the Baoding Military Academy. In the second year, I was sent from the military academy to Japan to study the army. At the age of 24, I was assigned to a Japanese field artillery regiment and enlisted for one year. During this year, I lived entirely as a soldier, extremely monotonous and solemn. The restraint of discipline and the monotony of life, dry and tasteless, made me feel very unreasonable at the time. But today, looking back, the ability of my life to be simple and my work to be constant, forty years as one day, is indeed due to the foundation laid by this year of soldier life training. I think that my lifelong revolutionary will and spirit, and the revolutionary fearless spirit I have today, are entirely due to the influence of this year of soldier life. If I had not had this year of military experience and had not undergone such a soldier's life, I might not have had such a revolutionary career today, so you must cherish this past year of soldier life and training, especially to understand, comprehend, and practice it, so that you will be able to succeed as a revolutionary cadre, and live up to the expectations of the national compatriots and my call for you to enlist and receive training.

### National Army Advances Towards Lafa; Train Service Between Changchun and Jilin Resumes

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] Whether the National Army has reached the outskirts of Harbin is unclear. Two different reports were simultaneously received here today. One said that the National Army marched north in three routes, and the vanguard had reached three miles from the outskirts of Harbin. The other was Zheng Dongguo's statement in Changchun on the 2nd that the National Army had made no new progress in recent days, and that the northeast of Yongji had reached the vicinity of Lafa, while the north had stopped on the south bank of the Songhua River, waiting to clear out the Communist troops with Yongji and Changchun as the center, before starting the first advance towards Harbin. Compared to the two, the latter is more reliable. It is also rumored that the Communist troops are using the terrain to build fortifications along the Xing'an Mountains and fortify Qiqihar.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The train service between Changchun and Jilin will resume on the 4th. General Liao Yaoxiang told reporters that after military transportation starts, passenger transportation can also be sold soon. The National Army in Jilin is advancing towards Lafa Station. Lafa Station is an important stronghold on the Labin Line, and trains on the north bank can reach Harbin.

[United Press, Northeast National Army Headquarters, 4th] General Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of General Du Yuming, revealed today that after the Communist troops blew up the iron bridge three days ago, they are now trying to fight a defensive battle to defend Harbin in the area 75 miles south of Harbin on the north bank of the Songhua River. Zhao Jiaxiang is only 38 years old and is the youngest two-star general in the National Army. When reporters asked where the war had taken place, he said: "It is not fierce in the northeast of Jilin, it is just a rearguard covering battle, the purpose is to delay our army's advance."

### Military Mediation Temporary Group; Inspects Zongping, North of Peiping, Huairou

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The temporary executive group of the Executive Headquarters, which had returned from inspecting Anci, Panggezhuang and other places, set off again yesterday to inspect the Mahuangyu area under Huairou County, north of Peiping, because it had previously been reported that five regiments of the Communist Army's 13th Brigade, led by Xiao Wenjiu, had arrived there to build fortifications.

### Feng Yuxiang and Others Arrive in Beijing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Feng Yuxiang, Wang Chonghui, Li Jishen, and Zou Lu arrived in Beijing at 9:00 AM on the 4th, taking the Minlian wheel from Chongqing via Hankou.

### Communist Army Activities on Various Lines in North China; The War is on the Brink of Explosive Danger

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] According to reliable sources, the Communist Army has again carried out major destruction in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. They attacked the National Army near Liulihe but were repelled. Several kilometers of the railway have been damaged successively and are now being repaired. It is also reported that more than 5,000 Communist troops active on the side of the Zhengtai Railway are also on the move. The Communist troops active on the Beining Line are rushing towards Tangshan, and it is rumored that Tangshan City is surrounded. At the same time, Kailuan, Lutai, and Hangu also telegraphed for help one after another. However, it is reported that the Communist troops in the Xianghe area have been defeated. The purpose of the Communist Army is obviously to seize the Kailuan coal mines, but according to people from North China, the strength of the National Army there should not be underestimated. If the Communist Army acts rashly and threatens the Kailuan coal mines, it will encounter a serious blow. The war in North China is on the brink of explosive danger.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] According to transportation sources, the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway are still being damaged from time to time. The stationmaster and some of the staff of the Jinpu Railway have been detained by the Communist Army and have not yet been released.

### Meeting to Revise the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System to Open Tomorrow Morning in the Capital; Discussion on Tax Reform and Establishing Provincial Budgets

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] The meeting to implement the revised financial revenue and expenditure system is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 6th at the Lixing Society. The conference will be presided over by Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and Minister of Food Xu Kan. It is also reported that the conference has requested Chairman Chiang and President Zhu to attend and give instructions at the opening ceremony. The central issue of this conference is the reform of the tax system, which is also an important adjustment to the current finances. After the conference achieves results, it will be announced and implemented nationwide. Conference members are scheduled to register starting today. It is reported that the conference is expected to have 160 attendees, including provincial governors, directors of finance departments, heads of food administration offices, mayors of municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, and directors of finance bureaus. However, some provinces have also sent observers. As of tonight, more than 30 people have registered, with a total of more than 40 people including observers. The governors, heads of land and grain departments, and directors of finance departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Songjiang, and Nenjiang provinces, as well as the directors of finance departments of Suiyuan and Chahar provinces, have already begun submitting proposals to the conference. Furthermore, the conference has already drafted important proposal documents, but they are still awaiting approval and organization. The conference is scheduled to last three days, proceeding rapidly with the most economical use of time, aiming for maximum efficiency. In addition, Finance Minister Yu is scheduled to hold a tea party at the ministry on the afternoon of the 5th to receive the members attending the conference in Nanjing and listen to the opinions of the representatives.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] It is reported that after this revision of the financial revenue and expenditure system, the provinces will be able to establish their own budgets. Fifty percent of the central government's business tax revenue, twenty percent of the land tax, and a portion of inheritance taxes will be allocated to the provinces. This will put county finances in good condition, and in the future, the collection of arrears will be changed to payment in kind.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] It is reported that Chairman Chiang will take the opportunity of the visit of provincial-level administrative heads to Nanjing to attend the meeting to implement the revised financial revenue and expenditure system to separately summon the provincial governors, directors of finance departments, mayors, and directors of finance bureaus to inquire and give instructions. It is also planned that during the period of military reorganization, he will take the opportunity of the visit of regimental commanders to Nanjing to report on their duties to summon the generals, listen to recent developments in the military, and discuss military reorganization, education, health, and the lives of officers and soldiers. The rumor that an important military conference will be held in the near future is inaccurate.

### The Corpse of Traitor Chen Gongbo is Prepared for Burial; Execution of Traitor Chu Minyi is Near; Traitor Li Shengwu Sentenced to Twelve Years of Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th Dispatch] After the execution of traitor Chen Gongbo on the morning of the 3rd in Suzhou, the prison authorities immediately notified his family to come to Suzhou to prepare the body for burial. It is now known that Chen's corpse was received by his servant Liu Yachen at the Third Prison at about 1:00 PM on the 4th and sent to the Suzhou Funeral Home. At around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, his wife Li Lizhuang finally arrived in Suzhou from Nanjing with her son Chen Gan. They went to the funeral hall and bowed three times to the remains, without shedding tears. She was wearing a light blue cloth cheongsam, and Chen's son was wearing a black Zhongshan suit. The color of sadness overflowed his face. A coffin made of high-quality catalpa wood was purchased for 900,000 yuan. The burial was simple, with only a drummer and no Taoist priests chanting scriptures to offer comfort. The clothes used for Chen's burial were all Zhongshan suits. Today, the number of people who went to the mourning hall to see the remains of this generation's great traitor was no less than several thousand, and the crowds were so dense that even the family members could not step forward to pay their respects. Many of the doors and windows of the mourning hall were damaged, and the desolate scene after the death of the traitor was very different from his former glory.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th Dispatch] Traitor Chu Minyi was sentenced to death by the Jiangsu High Court on April 22nd. His wife, Chen Wuzhen, dissatisfied with the original verdict, applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The First Criminal Division of the Supreme Court upheld the original verdict on May 25th and approved it. The ruling was sent from Nanjing to Suzhou by express delivery on the evening of the 3rd. The High Court delivered it to Chu's prison cell in the Third Prison on the morning of the 4th. After the reporter inquired, he visited President Sun Hongji of the court and learned that the execution order had not yet arrived, but it would take no more than two or three days.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th Dispatch] At 7:00 AM this morning, Chu Minyi's wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, along with her daughter Chu Mengyuan and Wang Wenxun, arrived in Suzhou from Nanjing. They immediately went to the visiting room of the Third Prison to visit Chu Minyi. At that time, Chu Minyi had received the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the original verdict and immediately told his wife and daughter: "My execution is near. You don't need to worry. Live peacefully." His wife and daughter wept bitterly during the meeting, which lasted thirty minutes before they separated.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] The Capital High Court judged the case of the traitor Li Shengwu at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. The defendant was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. After hearing the verdict, Li showed no expression in court. He was then escorted by two bailiffs to the Capital District Court Detention Center for temporary detention. Once the review and approval are obtained, he will be officially transferred to the Capital Prison for execution. The main points of the judgment are as follows: "Li Shengwu, conspiring with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country, is sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for ten years. All property, except for what is necessary for the family's living expenses, is confiscated." The full text of the judgment pointed out that Li's actions of assisting the puppet regime were undeniable, and he could not shirk legal responsibility. However, it stated that when the defendant was the Minister of Education of the puppet regime, he requested the puppet Central Political Committee to issue an amnesty decree, as evidenced by the Puppet Judicial Administration Gazette published on July 8, 1940, which benefited patriotic people and participants of the resistance movement. When he was the Minister of Education of the puppet regime, he made great efforts to maintain church schools and private schools, preventing them from being trampled by the enemy. Furthermore, more than eighty people, including Bao Zhong, came forward to testify to his beneficial acts for the people, and the evidence was indeed reliable. Therefore, the sentence was reduced according to law to show fairness. It is understood that the eighty people mentioned in the judgment, including Bao Zhong, are current faculty members of Jinling University and various private middle schools in this city.

### Supreme Court Judgment: The Crime of Traitor Chu is Clearly Proven; Original Verdict Upheld

Supreme Court Special Criminal Judgment, Thirty-Fifth Year, Jing Fu Zi No. 161

Petitioner Chu Chen Shunzhen is the wife of Chu Minyi, 40 years old, address unknown.

Defendant Chu Minyi, male, 64 years old, resident of Xuzhen Town, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province.

Regarding the petitioner's request for a retrial of the defendant's case of treason, based on the judgment of the Jiangsu High Court on April 22nd of the 35th year of the Republic of China, this court rules as follows:

Ruling:

The original verdict is upheld.

Reasoning:

The defendant in this case, Chu Minyi, originally served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. After the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he took refuge in Shanghai. In the summer of 1939, Wang Zhaoming arrived in Shanghai to secretly collude with the Japanese invaders and convened the Sixth National Congress of the puppet Kuomintang. At that time, the defendant participated, serving as the Secretary-General of the puppet Central Party Headquarters, a member of the Central Executive Committee, and a member of the Supervisory Committee. He followed Wang in running between Nanjing and Qingdao, consulting with the puppet "Renovation" and "Temporary" governments on the issue of reorganization. After an agreement was reached, the puppet National Government was established in Nanjing on March 30 of the following year, where he served as the Vice President of the Puppet Executive Yuan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Puppet Government, and was also in charge of the return of the Puppet Government to the capital. In May of the same year, he accompanied Chen Gongbo to Japan in the capacity of a puppet deputy envoy to offer thanks. Later, he participated in the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, allowing the Japanese invaders to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, as well as station fleets in China's territorial waters and implement economic cooperation. At the same time, he issued the "Sino-Japanese-Manchu" joint declaration, recognizing "Manchukuo," thereby undermining the integrity of China's territory. In February of the following year, he was transferred to be the ambassador to Japan, contacting the Axis powers to recognize the puppet government. In September, he returned to serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the puppet government. After the puppet government declared war on the United States and Britain in 1943, he concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese invaders and accompanied Wang Dao to Tokyo to attend the Greater East Asia Conference, repeatedly using fallacies to spread propaganda to destroy the United States and Britain and eliminate the Central Government. In July 1945, he took office as the Governor of the puppet Guangdong Province, concurrently serving as the Commander of the puppet Guangdong Security Force and the Director of the puppet Guangzhou Pacification Office. The defendant has confessed to these facts repeatedly during the investigation and the Guangzhou trial. The original trial confirmed that his confession was consistent with his "Autobiography of Participation in the Peace Movement" and the confessions of accomplices Chen Gongbo and Chen Bi-jun in other cases. Furthermore, the appointment letter of the puppet National Government, the "Joint Statement of the Greater East Asia Conference," and the "Record of the Puppet National Government's Delegation to Japan for Gratitude" extracted from the Chen Gongbo case, "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government," "The Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War," and "Domestic News Clipping Book" were sufficient to confirm this. It was therefore determined that his actions of colluding with the enemy to plot rebellion were extremely obvious, and the circumstances of the crime were particularly serious. Based on Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Article 2, Paragraph 1, First Section, Article 28, and Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, he was sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property, except for what is necessary for the family's living expenses, was confiscated. The determination of the facts and the application of the law were correct. The petitioner's argument for a retrial states that at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the enemy invaders penetrated deep, and Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui fell, the defendant emerged to rescue the people and preserve the nation's vitality and participated in the organization of the government and assumed duties. This was a division of labor and cooperation with armed resistance against Japan, with different paths leading to the same goal. As for his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was merely holding a nominal position. The defendant did not sign all the treaties concluded between China and Japan, the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchuria, and the declaration of war on the United States and Britain. Furthermore, he used Japan to recover the concessions of various countries, which was not without merit. This court believes that each of the points raised by the petitioner has already been argued by the defendant, and after the original organization investigated, it was deemed that they were just excuses and evasions, and were insufficient to be adopted. The reasoning has been explained in detail in the reasoning of the judgment. Furthermore, it was found that the defendant had served in key central positions, and when the enemy army penetrated deep and the war was urgent, he did not know how to cooperate with one heart to resist foreign aggression, but willingly attached himself to the rebels and betrayed the central government. According to his confession, after organizing the puppet government, he went to Japan to offer thanks, participated in the Greater East Asia Conference, and discussed the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and issued the Sino-Japanese-Manchu joint declaration and declared war on the Allied powers of Britain and the United States, expressing his willingness to live and die with the Japanese invaders. In his speech at the "Return to the Past and New Understanding" on September 18th, he mentioned that "Friendly countries (referring to the Japanese invaders) are doing their utmost to strengthen our National Government (referring to the puppet government) to continue to destroy Chongqing" and "In Greater East Asia, only a corner of Chongqing is still blindly engaging in war, but because the backing of the United States and Britain has been completely lost, Chongqing has become a turtle in a jar, and destruction is only a matter of time." His crimes of colluding with the enemy to plot resistance against his country have been extremely clearly proven. The petitioner's repeated arbitrary defenses are not worthy of adoption. The original judgment is correct and should be approved according to law. Based on the above conclusions, it is ruled that the judgment should be made according to Article 20, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations, as stated in the main text. May 24th of the 35th year of the Republic of China, First Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, presiding judge Zai Jun, judge Li Shaoyan, judge Ren Ji, judge Lin Shangyou. It is certified that this is a true copy of the original, Secretary Li Shiping, May 29th of the 35th year of the Republic of China.

### Resources Committee and Guangdong Provincial Government Jointly Operate Wengjiang Hydropower Plant; First Phase of Project Scheduled to Be Completed in Two Years

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd Dispatch] The Wengjiang Hydropower Plant, jointly operated by the Resources Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Government, has been surveyed by two groups of technicians dispatched by the Resources Committee to the related areas of Wengyuan, Yingde, and Renhua counties. The entire project plan budget and contract, etc., will be signed with the construction company in the short term. It is found that the initial operating expenses are estimated to be about 16 million US dollars. After the completion of the first phase of the project, which is scheduled to take two years, it can generate 170,000 horsepower. The engines and various equipment used in the plant are supplied under the Canadian Reciprocal Trade Agreement and are currently being dispatched to Hong Kong for unloading and transshipment to Wengjiang.

### Guangzhou Flooded with Foreign Cigarettes; Local Tobacco Industry on the Verge of Collapse

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd Dispatch] Recently, the market in Guangzhou has been flooded with duty-free foreign cigarettes, causing the local cigarette industry to suffer severely. More than eighty manufacturers have closed down one after another, with more than sixty facing serious difficulties. According to the person in charge of the Cigarette Industry Association, the current tax on local cigarettes has reached 100%, which is a heavy burden. Smuggled foreign cigarettes are rampant, and the price of foreign cigarettes is almost equal to that of local cigarettes. Therefore, the general public abandons local cigarettes in favor of foreign ones. As a result, the business of local cigarettes, which had a monthly turnover of 200,000,000 yuan, has plummeted. The number of unemployed cigarette workers has reached 30,000. If the domestic cigarette industry collapses and foreign cigarettes seize the market, the country will suffer another huge loss in revenue. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.

Hangzhou: Electricity Prices Increased in Urban Areas. Due to the increase in the price of coal allocated from Shanghai, the Hangzhou Power Plant needs to cover a loss of more than 50 million yuan per month. With the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, electricity prices will be moderately increased from June 1st. The electricity price for motors will be increased by 60 yuan from the original 155 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and the electricity price for lighting will be increased by 25 yuan from the original 135 yuan per kilowatt-hour. However, the price of allocated coal has increased again in Shanghai, and the plant is still losing money in fact.

Kunshan: All Sectors Console Retired Veterans. The 21st Corps of the National Army stationed in Kunshan has completed its reorganization as ordered. All soldiers of various units who have retired beyond their age limit, totaling 210, are about to leave the camp.

After holding a meeting to discuss and decide on the methods, a large number of慰勞品 (consolation gifts) were collected.

Jiangyin: Only a Few Money Shops are Open. As the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, the Qianzhuang (money shop) industry held a special meeting the other day. Only eight companies, including Tongxing, attended. In the past, there were a total of 37 registered money shops. Nine of them were damaged in the war, and a total of 28 could be repaired and opened. However, none of them have received deposits from merchants. The merchants are deeply pained and recall the cruel situation. The current remedial measure is to notify all the money shops to register with the Wuxi Improvement Zone and handle代烘 (proxy烘焙, most likely proxy banking) as much as possible to make up for the losses. Another conference will be held later.

Changshu: Security Team Reorganized into Police Team. The county government ordered the removal of Hu Mingyi, the captain of the security brigade, because his adjutant Pan Shijie and the second squadron leader Mu Jingbin forcibly bought yellow croakers in the third district, illegally profiting from them. After investigation, the facts were verified, and they were dismissed. The adjutant Pan Shijie was detained for four days, and the squadron leader Mu Jingbin received a major demerit.

On the 2nd, more than forty representatives were sent by the township chief Wang Youshi to the county to petition, requesting the county chief to investigate thoroughly and also to go to the pacification district headquarters to request relief. Li, the chief of the military section of the county government, has personally gone to the township to investigate the facts. It is said that the traffic police were reorganized from puppet troops, so there was this illegal incident.

### Review of Overseas Study Policies

Recently, the Ministry of Education has successively announced the regulations for self-funded study abroad examinations and the measures for publicly funded study abroad. Registration for self-funded study abroad began on May 15th, and registration for publicly funded study abroad began on June 1st. Examinations will be held separately soon. Aspiring young people who want to pursue advanced studies will naturally have the opportunity to study abroad. Today's Chinese youth, those in the occupied areas, have undergone poisonous education from the enemy and puppets for seven or eight years. Those in the rear have also been blockaded by the war for seven or eight years. Once they have the opportunity to take the exam and go abroad, change their environment, breathe some fresh air, and study useful subjects with similar characteristics, it is a fortunate thing for both themselves and the country and society. However, should the government have an overall plan for a large number of young students studying abroad? This is the problem of China's overall overseas study policy.

China has been sending young students to study abroad for fifty or sixty years. People have different views on the success or failure of this system, just as the saying goes, "The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom." But in any case, given China's scientific backwardness and the scarcity of talent, if we want to catch up quickly and build a modern country successfully, the overseas study policy is still worth advocating. Over the years, it cannot be said that overseas students have made no contribution to the country. The reform of the political system, the transformation of society, and the establishment of various new undertakings, more or less have the blood and life sacrifices of overseas students in them. The reason why the results are not as good as our ideal is half due to the environment after the overseas students returned to China, and half due to the poor handling methods. As for the malpractices caused by the overseas study system, they are all man-made and not incurable diseases. In the late Qing Dynasty and the Beiyang era, there was no educational policy to speak of. Let's put that aside for now. After the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the government adopted a strict policy towards overseas study. Not only did publicly funded students have to pass the Ministry of Education's examination for admission, but self-funded students also had to obtain a study abroad certificate from the Ministry of Education before they could go through the procedures for going abroad. During the Anti-Japanese War, the government moved west, and the coastal areas were completely blockaded by the enemy. Transportation between China and foreign countries was cut off, and technical obstacles arose to studying abroad. For several years, even the publicly funded study abroad examinations were suspended, let alone self-funded study abroad. Later, when air transportation was smooth, the Ministry of Education began to continue the process in the temporary capital. Both publicly funded and self-funded students had to pass the examination before they were allowed to go abroad. Reading the two regulations recently announced by the Ministry of Education, today's overseas study policy can be said to remain the same, with no changes. We believe that in order to make the overseas study policy more effective, we must pay attention to the following two points:

First, the overseas study policy must be coordinated with the steps of national construction. Now that the Anti-Japanese War is over and we have entered the period of national construction, post-war China is facing many challenges and there are many things to be rebuilt. In addition to material and financial resources, it especially needs a large number of specialized talents and practical cadres. In the past seven or eight years, it is undeniable that China's higher education has declined due to the impact of the war. The world's new knowledge is advancing rapidly, while China's universities are still in the process of moving back and recovering. In addition, the war losses have been enormous, and restoration is not easy, and equipment is even more difficult to perfect. As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." Cultivating talents cannot be achieved overnight. In order to meet urgent needs, encouraging aspiring young people to study abroad is a timely and good strategy. But we must ask: Has the government already determined the steps and priorities for the work of national construction? Has it roughly calculated how many specialized talents and senior cadres are needed for a certain undertaking? Has it considered how to accommodate these trained talents after they return to the country, so that they will not feel that they are "not using what they have learned" or "not being appreciated for their talents"? If today we only know how to examine overseas students, and there is still no plan or coordination, then when a large number of young people go abroad now and return when their term expires in the future, they may not be able to "make the best use of their talents." Having pillars but no foundation, having doors and windows but no walls, still cannot construct a house. In terms of national finances, it is an economic waste; for young students, it is a waste of talent. Moreover, once Chinese students go abroad, they are like horses that have broken free of their reins, and no one cares. Everyone does their own thing, a pile of loose sand, which is not an exaggeration. We have seen that when the Soviet Union sent students to study abroad, the authorities had an overall plan, organization, and guidance, and the talents cultivated abroad were completely able to coordinate with the talents needed domestically. No wonder their three five-year plans were able to turn the country around. Looking back at China, the Ministry of Education's announcement of the number of self-funded and publicly funded students and subjects this time, apart from strengthening the control of self-funded students, there is really no overall plan to be seen. But we cannot solely blame the Ministry of Education. We must first ask whether the entire government has determined a plan and steps for the national construction work in the next three to five years; if not, how can we ask the Ministry of Education to coordinate?

Second, the overseas study examination must select real and practical talents. If the country has a national construction plan and determines the number of talents needed, it can use various methods to encourage young people to study abroad in the subjects that the country urgently needs, and it does not necessarily have to go through an examination. Because there is no official or black market price for foreign exchange now, why not approve foreign exchange to encourage aspiring young people to pursue advanced studies, rather than letting private individuals apply for foreign exchange to buy foreign goods indiscriminately. However, since there is an examination, attention should be paid to selecting true talents and practical skills during the examination. Not only should the favors of relatives and friends not be sold, but also why should we value rigid diplomas? The subjects can be tested strictly, the questions can be set more, the level can be raised higher, and the oral examination can be conducted more seriously. No matter who registers for the examination, as long as they are qualified, we should select the best among the qualified, without having to ask how many years they have studied or which school they graduated from. To be honest, among today's college students, there are quite a few graduates whose level may not be better than that of high school graduates fifteen years ago. Moreover, regardless of China or foreign countries, there are also many scholars in society who are fond of learning and thinking deeply, who have not graduated from college or attended college. They study on their own and have gained knowledge. If they are introduced and recommended by the president or professors of the university, why can't they have the same opportunity to take the exam? Therefore, judging the effectiveness of the examination from the examination system, it is better to strictly prevent cheating by the examiners than to restrict the qualifications of the examinees, because doing the latter can naturally select true talents, while merely paying attention to the former may lead to rejecting true talents from the door.

### Bevin Criticizes Soviet Policy: Is the World Only a Democratic Country in the Soviet Union? Adopting the Soviet System is Actually a Regression

[Special Dispatch] London, 4th (Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, elaborating on British foreign policy. In addition to expressing his approval of the US proposal to disarm Germany for twenty-five years, he also used gentle language towards the Soviet Union, hoping that it would cooperate with Britain and the United States on European issues. Bevin said: Due to the difference in political ideologies, the work of creating peace will be extremely difficult, but he is by no means pessimistic about the future of peace. Soviet Litvinov once said that peace is indivisible, and he absolutely agrees with this statement. If the Soviet Union cannot cooperate in Europe, there will be no peace and security. The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held again next week, and it is hoped that the Soviet side will show cooperation so that the European issue can be resolved. Bevin said that the British side had suggested to Stalin to extend the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship for fifty years, but it was not successful, and he deeply hoped that this could still be achieved. Bevin also reported and reviewed the negotiation situation at the last Paris conference.

[Special Dispatch] London, 4th (Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech in the House of Commons today: If we do not want a total war, we must strive for total peace. In order to achieve this goal, countries must understand each other's motives. The situation after World War II is far more complicated than after World War I. The Soviet Union suffered heavy losses in the war and made many contributions. After the war, the cooperation of the Soviet Union is also necessary to ensure peace in Europe. However, there is a clear tendency on the Soviet side to believe that only the Soviet Union represents the interests of the workers, only the Soviet Union is a democratic country, and other countries are suspected of being fascist or pro-fascist. It seems that the security of the Soviet Union must be guaranteed after every country in the world adopts the Soviet system. However, Britain has its own path to progress. Our country began the industrial revolution 150 years ago. If we start to adopt the Soviet method now, it is not progress but regression.

### The Results of the French Election Satisfy Britain and the United States: The Connection Between the Three Countries Will Be Strengthened: The British Newspaper Believes That Democracy Has Triumphed Over Dictatorship: The Power of the Catholic Party Has Spread Throughout Western Europe

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Diplomatic circles here today expect that the results of the general election in France will strengthen the country's political and economic ties with the United States and Britain. State Department officials remain silent on this, but the Republican People's Movement has overwhelmed the Communist Party in this election and has become the most powerful political party in France. The US government privately expressed its satisfaction. In general, US officials have a good relationship with French Foreign Minister Bidault, the leader of the Republican People's Movement. Now that Bidault's party has taken the lead in the political parties, it will inevitably adopt a stronger position on most issues. The US authorities firmly believe that whenever important issues arise that are very different from the Soviet Union's views, Bidault's position will agree with the United States and Britain. As for the economy, the Republican People's Movement will try to promote trade policies along a path closer to what the United States advocates, rather than nationalizing French industry as advocated by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

[French News Agency, London, 3rd] The "Standard Evening News" published an editorial today, reviewing the results of the French general election, stating: The results of this election are of great significance, not only for France but also for Europe. France has resolutely rejected the dictatorship system. At this time, the People's Republican Movement and the Socialist Party should jointly draft a constitution that can be accepted by the entire country. The "Star", the organ of the Liberal Party, also wrote an article stating: The idea of democracy has triumphed over the dictatorship of the proletariat. People have long predicted that post-war France will become a communist world, but now it seems to prove that their views are wrong. Among the parties in France that oppose the truly democratic parliament, communism is like a small wizard meeting a big wizard.

[Reuters, London, 4th] As a result of the elections in France and Italy, Western Europe seems to be becoming the world of conservative parties and anti-communist parties. Except for Spain and Portugal, which are ruled by Catholic totalitarian regimes, the rest are all democratic and elect the power of right-wing Catholic parties. A political observer in London once said: The famous "Western European Group" seems to have gradually become a reality, but its center is not in socialist Britain, but in the Vatican. According to the results of the recent municipal elections in Italy, the Catholic Christian Democratic Party seems to have an advantage. If so, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Austria, southern Germany and Italy will all become the sphere of influence of Catholic parties.

### The Republican Party in Italy Has the Upper Hand in the Political System Election

[Reuters, Rome, 4th] Italy announced the preliminary results of the election this morning. The densely populated north tends to the republican system, while the south and Sardinia and Sicily tend to the monarchy. King Umberto's fate is still in balance. Although the people in the north expressed opposition, the votes cast in the rural areas should also be counted. According to Associate Nenni, about 10% of the votes have been counted, and the results are as follows: 1,509,000 votes in favor of the republican system. One-fifth of the votes for the constitutional assembly have now been counted, and the results are as follows: Christian Democratic Party 2,050,000 votes, Socialist Party 1,365,000 votes, Communist Party 1,229,000 votes.

### Former Soviet Leader Mikhail Kalinin Passes Away

[TASS, Moscow, 3rd] Prominent Soviet leader and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Kalinin, passed away today at 10:05 PM after a long and serious illness, at the age of seventy.

Kalinin's Brief History [Reuters, London, 3rd] Moscow Radio said: Kalinin was one of the most outstanding creators of the Communist Party and the Soviet state. He resigned from the post of Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Committee on March 19 this year due to poor health, and he was succeeded by Shvernik. Kalinin has the nickname of Kremlin Peasant. He began to learn the alphabet from a soldier at the age of ten. In 1898, he became a member of the Social Democratic Party, which later became the Bolshevik Party. After joining the party, Kalinin began his life of being arrested and fleeing. When he fled to the Caucasus, he became close friends with Chuchashvili, later Stalin. In 1923, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established, and Kalinin became the first president.

Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Hold a Memorial Service [Central News Agency, Shanghai] At 8:00 PM last night, Soviet overseas Chinese in Shanghai held a memorial service for Kalinin at 805 Foch Road. People from diplomatic circles at home and abroad, as well as Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, attended.

### New Soviet Ambassador to the United States Presents Credentials

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Novikov, presented his credentials to President Truman today. Truman and Novikov gave speeches, mutually guaranteeing to promote relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The President declared: The United States will give prompt and sympathetic consideration to the Soviet Union's proposals to facilitate their realization, and hopes that the Soviet Union will give the same consideration to the proposals made by the United States. Former Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko has been transferred to serve as the permanent representative of the Security Council of the United Nations Organization, and his vacancy will be filled by Novikov.

### Vandenberg Delivers a Speech Calling for a "People's Peace" Opposing Secret Cooperation Among Powerful Countries to Monopolize Peace Supporting the Current US Foreign Policy

[United Press, Three Rivers, Michigan, 3rd] Senator Vandenberg today called for a "people's peace," warning against secret cooperation among powerful countries to monopolize world peace. Vandenberg, who accompanied Secretary of State Byrnes to the Paris Conference of Four Foreign Ministers, gave a speech on Washington Radio today for Three Rivers, saying that the Paris Conference established a US foreign policy that advocates "inviting all belligerent countries to have appropriate say in our common peace." In this respect, the Paris Conference was a success. Vandenberg also earnestly asked the Soviet Union to be tolerant in the peace treaty negotiations. Vandenberg expressed his unease at the Soviet Union's insistence on not convening a peace conference until the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and France had reached agreement on basic issues. It is said that the Soviet Union is using a veto power, which makes the entire peace mechanism more shaky. This right of the Soviet Union is within the scope of the agreement previously signed by the four powers, but history teaches us that "rights" can become "mistakes" if they are not exercised with wisdom and tolerance and are solely based on power. Although Vandenberg is a Republican, he said that he will support the current US foreign policy under any government. This policy is the greatest guarantee against any aggression by the Axis powers, and expansionism is a great threat to future peace and security. The armistice treaties currently signed with the countries concerned are not enough to end the war situation. If the peace treaty is delayed and cannot be established, it will exceed the limits of all reason and security.

### Stettinius Resigns, Truman Approves

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Stettinius, the US representative to the United Nations Organization, has resigned, and President Truman approved it today. It is said that during the meeting at the White House today, he accepted it because Stettinius was very determined to leave. The White House then issued a letter from the President to Stettinius, hoping that everything he decides to do will go smoothly. Stettinius, the former Secretary of State, has been dissatisfied for several months because he has been playing a relatively unimportant role in the United Nations Organization, so he had long planned to leave.

[French News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Stettinius will still attend and participate in the Security Council's discussion of the Spanish issue tomorrow until the President appoints a successor representative before he resigns.

[United Press, New York, 4th] All parties in the United States speculate that the successor to Stettinius will be Wright, the current US representative to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations Organization. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davies are also possible successors.

### The First Anniversary of the Signing of the United Nations Charter San Francisco Prepares to Celebrate

[US News Agency, San Francisco, 3rd] June 26 is the first anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, and San Francisco has begun to prepare for a grand celebration. UN Secretary-General Lie will be the main speaker at the celebration.

### 2 Million Japanese Missing in Soviet-Occupied Areas It is Difficult for Outsiders to Explore the Inside Story of the Soviet "Iron Curtain"

According to the Japanese government's report, the whereabouts of the Japanese in the Soviet-occupied areas at the end of the war are still unknown. Among them, there are about 1 million Japanese overseas Chinese, and about 600,000 to 700,000 of the Kwantung Army. The Japanese government also has no way to report on the situation of the Japanese in Korea, Kunashiri Island, and Etorofu Island after the surrender. A senior officer of the General Headquarters said: The "Iron Curtain" erected by the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe cannot be broken, and the situation in Asia is the same. Recently, when Japanese diplomats returning to China from the Soviet Union passed through Siberia, they saw some Japanese working along the railway.

### MacArthur Orders Restrictions on the Activities of Japanese Zaibatsu

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] MacArthur today ordered restrictions on the financial activities of Japan's top ten zaibatsu, including Kawai of the former Manchurian Industrial Machinery, former Prime Minister Ayukawa, aircraft manufacturing tycoon Nakajima, and trader Okura. The four major zaibatsu, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Yasuda, had previously been restricted.

### British Newspaper Cites News From Rome: Southern Country Implements Total Mobilization Venice Giulia Declares a State of Emergency A Fleet of US Warships Arrives at the Port of Trieste

[United Press, London, 4th] The Daily Mail's correspondent in Rome reported today: According to reliable news from Rome, Belgrade (the capital of Southern Country) newspapers declared that Yugoslavia has implemented total mobilization. It is also reported that the first district of Venice Giulia, which is garrisoned by United Nations troops, has declared a state of emergency. United Nations troops conducted searches for arms to prevent a coup by the Tito regime. According to news from the United Nations News Agency in Rome, a fleet of US warships arrived at the port of Trieste on the 1st of this month, which is the first time US warships have entered the port since its liberation. However, little news has come out of Yugoslavia, and it is not yet known what the situation is in the country.

### Invasion, Massacre, Disruption of Order: Japanese War Crimes Shocking, Chief Prosecutor Reads Indictment in Court, International Tribunal Adjourns to Resume Hearing on the 13th

(Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 4th) The Far East International Tribunal convened this morning at 9:30 AM to hear Chief Prosecutor Keenan's public statement of the indictment's intent. General Zhan Jian, Commander of the Chinese Occupation Forces in Japan, who came to Japan to discuss occupation work with MacArthur, also attended the court to listen. Before Keenan read the indictment, Chief Defense Attorney Kiyose proposed that the Japanese translation was incomplete and hoped that the prosecution team would provide a complete translation. Presiding Judge Webb did not allow Kiyose to continue speaking, stating that this was not a reasonable motion and should be stopped immediately. Upon hearing this, Keenan smiled towards the defense counsel and continued to read the indictment, which was 15,000 words long, eloquently worded, and accused the defendants of destroying democratic systems and people's freedom, showing no respect for humanity, and arbitrarily establishing a so-called new order to replace it, massacring and enslaving millions of people. (The following is a United Press dispatch)

 Forming Cliques and Launching Aggression Keenan also stated that this trial is not an ordinary trial, but part of a battle to preserve the culture of the entire world from being destroyed. This threat of destruction does not come from natural forces, but from the meticulous planning of individuals. These people form cliques and seem to want to bring about the end of the world under their crazy ambitions of domination. Each of these defendants now in the dock shares responsibility for murder and robbery, which is part of Japan's eighteen-year plan of aggression in the Far East and the Pacific. A very small number of people in the world, including these defendants, monopolize the law and want to force humanity to obey their personal will. They declared war on civilization, created their own rules, and determined various events themselves. The defendants intended to destroy democracy, so they colluded with the Nazis in an attempt to establish a new order. Japanese aggressors jointly planned, prepared, and launched aggressive wars against democracy with Hitler's party members. The defendants murdered and suppressed millions of people, slaughtered the elderly and children, even eliminated entire societies, and regarded treaties and agreements as waste paper. This trial may be one of the most important trials in history, of great significance to the representatives of the eleven countries present, whose governments govern more than half of the world's population.

Clearly Stating the Trial's Goals This trial is also of equal importance to other countries and the future generations of every nation, because this kind of trial can have a far-reaching impact on world peace and security. At the beginning of this trial, the person presiding over the trial should clearly state its goals. Our broad purpose is to implement the rule of law, and its specific goal is to do everything possible to prevent the scourge of aggressive war. Defendants Tojo Hideki and his group, under strict surveillance, sat in the courtroom converted from the former Army Ministry building, listening to the translated indictment. Keenan continued, this group's conspiracy was to allocate and control East Asia, and eventually the whole world. Keenan then listed the various crimes, saying that initiating murder is by no means consistent with justice and law. Murdering one million people is no less a crime than murdering one person. Swearing to uphold the laws and institutions of a country cannot exempt one from punishment, nor can the war that sacrificed the lives of millions of people be recognized as an "incident," nor can the promotion of national policy interpreted by these individuals be recognized as legitimate. The defendants should know that the war they planned would only result in the destruction of all human life. If it is said that punishing individuals who bring civilization to the brink of extinction is illegal, then justice itself becomes a joke. The defendants argued that even if it is proven that they participated in conspiracies to promote open or covert wars of aggression, there is no power in the world that can bring them to justice.

Citing Legal Principles to Prove Crimes Keenan accused the defendants of wickedly planning and launching a war against the United Nations, and hundreds of illegal acts since Japan's aggression against Manchuria are equally guilty. Keenan responded to the defense's accusation of legal qualification, saying that the victorious nations have the right to bring the warlords and politicians of defeated Japan to justice. This trial is not intended as revenge, but to prevent the scourge of aggressive war. Keenan also cited legal grounds to prove that the eleven Allied nations have the special right to prosecute war criminals, and requested that aggressive war be regarded as a crime according to international law, both now and in the past. To reach this conclusion, two facts must be based on: first, there must be international law on this matter; second, according to this international law, this matter should be a crime. Determining this fact, recognizing and legally declaring these two principles by this court and the Eastern Military Tribunal here as an integral part of international common law, is truly a historical innovation.

After today's adjournment, the International Tribunal will postpone the hearing until the thirteenth of this month.

At this time, Hirota, known for advocating the so-called three principles towards China, took the opportunity to frequently look at his family in the Japanese special audience seats. When the local official shouted "Sit down", he still stared without moving. After the captain of the military police forced him to sit down, he could not help but shed tears. Tojo hurriedly signaled him to pay attention. Hirota took out a handkerchief to wipe away his tears, looking dejected.

### Important Resolutions of Housing Allocation Meeting: Decide to Re-Allocate German Overseas Chinese's Abandoned Houses, Nine Agencies Given Priority for Twenty-Eight Houses, Some Applicant Agencies Should Re-Fill Detailed Forms

(Report from This Newspaper) The Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies held its ninth committee meeting in the City Hall conference room at 3 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu served as chairman, with Deputy Director He Dequi, and Huang Boqiao, committee members Liu Gongyun, Xu [], Cha Liangjian, and others all in attendance. After the committee members discussed the results: (1) In view of the fact that some agencies applying for housing have not filled in the number of returnees, the number of housing needed, and the number of inhabited houses in detail according to the prescribed form, making it impossible to uniformly review and allocate. It was decided that all agencies that have not filled in the details should be given a deadline of one time, and those who do not act will not be allocated housing by the committee, and those who do not report after the deadline will also be cancelled. Those who have already occupied the houses will be ordered to move out, and if any floating or false reports are found, they will be transferred to the competent officials for strict punishment. The application letters that have been reviewed and decided not to be allocated housing will be answered one by one. (2) In order to expedite the allocation of housing, several empty houses that have been found will be allocated to several agencies that urgently need housing. The following were approved: Higher Court 6 (Ruikang Li 31, 32, 65, 110, C58, etc.), Jianghai Customs 3 (Zhe Xing Li 32, 108, 191), Social Affairs Department National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office 1 (Zhe Xing Li 201), Central Propaganda Department International Propaganda Office 2 (East Chang'an Li 28, 29), Shanghai Municipal Government 1 (East Chang'an Li 49), Ministry of Economic Affairs Equipment General Warehouse 3 (Gonghe Li 7, 32, 45), Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department 3 (Yuqingfang 7, 29, 77), Secretary of the President of the Song Dynasty 3 (Yuqingfang 106, 113, 158), Shanghai District Court 6 (Yuan Maoli 36, 38, 42, 43, 56, 57), (3) The houses allocated by the committee were originally limited to the private property lived in by Japanese overseas Chinese. Now that German overseas Chinese in Shanghai will be repatriated one after another in the near future, the houses rented by these German overseas Chinese are mostly located in the central and western districts, and the buildings are quite tidy. It is now also decided that the German overseas Chinese Management Committee will open a clear list and transfer it to the committee for unified casting and distribution. As for the detailed measures, an emergency meeting will be convened at 3 PM tomorrow (6th) for discussion. However, German overseas Chinese private property is still handled by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau.

### Decision to Investigate and Suppress Landlords Demanding Gold Bars

(Report from This Newspaper) Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental and Management Committee, it has provided mediation on rental disputes between landlords and tenants. After Mayor Wu took office, he was determined to suppress the unreasonable method of topping houses with gold bars. According to the person in charge of the committee, personnel have been sent to investigate the matter of landlords demanding gold bars. However, due to the limited manpower in the committee, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate and report any such incidents that occur so that they can be investigated and prosecuted, and please ask the local court and military police authorities to assist in the execution. On the active side, the municipal government hopes that citizens can build houses as soon as possible and encourage construction. It is even better for landlords to build their own houses, otherwise, citizens will be allowed to borrow land to build houses, and banks are expected to provide loans or investments to reduce the housing shortage. At the same time, it is planned to investigate the actual number of houses in the city and allocate them according to the population. Those with a small population and many empty houses will be forced to rent them out. According to the person in charge, the housing shortage in the city is still caused by human factors, so they are extremely willing for tenants to report voluntarily. After the committee verifies the report, in addition to ordering the landlord to return the gold bars, they will also rent the house to the tenant at a reasonable price.

### Time to Send German Overseas Chinese Back is a Matter of Time, Technicians May Be Allowed to Stay Temporarily

(Report from This Newspaper) How to send German overseas Chinese in Shanghai back to their country has attracted much attention from China and foreign countries. According to a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in principle, China and Germany are still in a state of war, and German overseas Chinese should be regarded as enemy overseas Chinese and sent back to their country as a whole. However, after being included in the list of those who should be evacuated, German overseas Chinese often put forward various reasons to request to stay in China. It is not known that the reasons and proof are legal issues, and today's evacuation of enemy overseas Chinese is a political issue, so even if they put forward various reasons and evidence, the Chinese government does not need to consider them. However, our country has always advocated generosity and also wants to retain some technicians to help us build, so the proposed evacuation lists have been submitted to the department for detailed assessment before making a decision. This list includes more than a thousand German overseas Chinese, but the date of evacuation and the evacuation theory have been formally denied by the spokesperson. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government's German overseas Chinese Management Committee息: The list of German overseas Chinese to be evacuated back to their country is decided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the committee is only responsible for execution. Yang Zhixiong, the former director of the committee, has resigned from the war, and the newly appointed director, Shen Naizheng, has personally taken over on June 1.

### The Foundation of New Buildings Should be Strengthened to Avoid Subsidence

(Report from This Newspaper) Some skyscrapers in the city have slight tilting or subsidence phenomena due to their location on the riverbank or low-lying areas. According to the construction magnate Tao Guilin, these high-rise buildings are all made of cement and steel, so there is an impact. The degree of subsidence has reached its peak and will not sink further. In the future, according to the terrain of Shanghai, the highest building can still be built with about 20 floors. However, the upper-level materials should use light and strong materials, and the foundation should be strengthened and increased to avoid subsidence. As for the construction of residences, although the construction materials are generally available, the sanitary equipment and appliances still need to be ordered from abroad, and the city's existing equipment is insufficient to meet the demand, so the date of construction must be determined after the sanitary equipment is enriched.

### The Litigation Fee for the Guangzhao Guild Case is More Than One Million, Request for Litigation Relief Requires Additional Submission

(Report from This Newspaper) Because Wen Niyongyao arbitrarily sold public property, the Shanghai Guangzhao Guild specially filed a deed with the court to sue Wen and Qiantai Commercial Bank, Tongyi Real Estate Company, Da'an Industrial Co., Ltd., Da Zhonghua Match Company, and Zhang Tonghe, etc., requesting confirmation that the sale and purchase of land was invalid and revoked the deed.

The legal representatives of the plaintiff, Lu Xingyuan, Feng Shaoshan, and Liang Yuming, all attended the court, while the defendants were not summoned. The subject matter of this lawsuit is more than 130 acres of real estate, worth 100,681,954,540 yuan in national currency, so the plaintiff should pay a litigation fee of 1.13 million yuan.

### Property Leasing Tax Rate Reduced After Modification, Sales Tax Still Levied According to Previous Regulations

The Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance is actively collecting property "leasing" and "sales" taxes. The reporter was recently told by the person in charge of this tax item: "Property leasing tax" is levied on the leasing of houses, godowns, docks, warehouses, fishing grounds, machinery, ships, automobiles, and other categories. Taking the real estate item as an example, there are more than 700,000 buildings in the city, so the collection work is very heavy. The property leasing tax rate for the first half of this year is still in accordance with the old tax law, with a maximum of 80% and a minimum of 10%. Recently, the tax law has been announced by the Ministry of Finance and included in the fourth category of the new income tax law, and the tax rate has also been modified and reduced, with a maximum of 30% and a minimum of 10%. It can be implemented in the second half of this year. As for the "property sales tax", sales tax can be levied on the income from the sale of land, houses, warehouses, docks, forests, and machinery. For example, automobiles are based on the sales and transfer registration form of the Public Works Bureau, and ships are based on the transfer form of the ship registration certificate issued by the Shipping Administration Bureau. Houses are based on the land ownership certificate obtained from the government. The tax rate is levied at a maximum of 50% and a minimum of 10% in accordance with the old law. In addition to the free declaration by the bureau team a few days ago, the ten district offices in the city have also conducted a general survey to avoid tax evasion.

The ancient Dragon Boat Festival set off a wave of revelry on the Huangpu Beach. Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, the Bund area was crowded with people, many of whom brought their elders and children and came from afar. They all gathered in the Bund Park and the Waibaidu Bridge to gamble on the dragon boat race. After the bell rang twice, twelve dragon boats were seen slowly sailing north from the Nanshi River. Each boat had about 20 people, sitting on both sides in an orderly manner, flying like arrows. There was also one person on the bow of each boat performing a grass skirt dance, playing games such as dragonflies, singing light songs and dancing wonderfully, high-spirited and cheerful. Eleven of the boats in front were all men, and those following behind were all women, heavily dressed and beautifully revealed. When the dragon boat team arrived near the Suzhou River, the sound of drums and gongs floated across the river. The audience suddenly cheered. After the dragon boats paraded in front of the audience for several times, they went one after another to Yangshupu.

### 生生 Pasture Manager Shen Wanling Refuses to Accept Appeal The Supreme Court Discovers Further Doubts Remanding for Retrial and Re-judgment Fake Councilor Yin Ding Yi Bitterly Proclaims Innocence Old Mother, Wife and Children Embrace and Weep Profusely

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shen Wanling, manager of the Sheng Sheng Pasture (son of Shen Jiu Cheng), was accused by all the employees of the pasture of providing resources to the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, and the High Court sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. The defendant refused to accept the appeal, and the accusers also expressed dissatisfaction, submitting a request for retrial. The Supreme Court has completed the review of the case files, discovered further doubts, and remanded the case for a new trial. The case will be reopened for debate in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court soon, with a re-judgment scheduled.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court heard several cases of traitors, all of which were adjourned for further hearing. The details are as follows:

Liu Shengwu, 50 years old, from Baoding, Hebei, graduated from Beiping Republic University. In November of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he led more than 20 political workers to work in Yiqiu Village, Yuan County, where he was captured by the enemy and immediately turned traitor. He successively served as a councilor of the pseudo-Henan Province Xiantiandao Association, the pseudo-Chongming County Magistrate, and the commander of the pseudo-Chongming County Security Brigade. After the victory, he was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau and sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. The defendant still quibbled, saying: (1) He complied with the pseudo-government's orders only when he had no other choice, (2) He had sheltered underground workers and organized welfare projects beneficial to the people, (3) He organized a defense team and had "merit" in opposing the communists, (4) He requested that Lu Jiangguang, Xiluo, and three others be summoned to testify.

Jin Xingjian, from Jiangsu, was transferred to Kunshan, Changshu, and other districts in the spring of the 30th year of the Republic (1941) by the pseudo-Special Service Headquarters to carry out espionage work, hindering our central government's great anti-Japanese cause, spying on military and political intelligence, and benefiting the enemy. The defendant repeatedly denied the charges in court.

Li Wenqi, a secret agent of the Shanghai South Gendarmerie, had framed Wu Senlin, the adjutant of the Loyalty and Salvation Army. The defendant also strongly defended himself, attempting to avoid punishment.

Yin Dingyi, a lieutenant general councilor of the pseudo-Nanjing government, confessed that he had never actually taken office. In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), his son Mao Xuan was captured and killed by pseudo-agents for underground work, and he was also arrested and released, monitored by two special agents. Later, he was appointed as a lieutenant general councilor as a means of appeasement. After the victory, he joined the Anti-Japanese War Martyrs Association and made speeches advocating strict punishment for traitors, which were resented by Lin Zhijiang and other pseudo-agents, who preemptively accused the defendant and went into hiding himself. Therefore, his arrest this time was unjust, he said. His wife brought the certificate of the Anti-Japanese War Martyrs Association to court as evidence. His old mother and three young children embraced each other and wept profusely, a truly tragic scene.

[Further Report] The cases of Li Xinchang, a ticket inspector of the pseudo-Central China Railway Company's Shanghai North Station, and Qiu Junlian, a protection officer of the pseudo-Gan County Nanxiang Township Office, who are suspected of being traitors, have been concluded. Qiu Junlian is scheduled to be sentenced on the 7th of this month, and Li Xinchang is scheduled to be sentenced on the 11th of this month.

(2) With the resumption of securities trading imminent, the association, in order to express the position of the municipal securities industry and fight for the rights it deserves, has sent letters to the Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance and Economics, stating that the association is the only securities industry association in the city.

### Government Commemorates Martyrs and Supplements Bereavement Regulations

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Military Affairs Commission, considering that the bereaved families receiving bereavement pensions lost government protection and suffered enemy and puppet oppression during the period of the occupation, has specially stipulated three measures for handling bereavement orders reissued by puppet organizations during the occupation period, in order to commemorate the martyrs and show sympathy: 1. Those who have received bereavement pensions from puppet organizations will not be reissued for the years they have already received. 2. If the original bereavement order has been cancelled and reissued by the puppet municipal government, the reissued puppet bereavement order should be submitted to the commission for verification and replacement with a bereavement order from this commission, based on which the pension will continue to be received. 3. For bereavement cases that were filed and lost before the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the bereaved family should submit the bereavement order when receiving the pension and forward it to the commission for verification and processing. The above measures have been instructed by the Military Affairs Commission to the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct its subordinates to investigate.

### Cardinal Tian Gengxin's Speech The Pope Admired Our Leader

Tian Gengxin, the Chinese Catholic Cardinal Archbishop, went to Sheshan from Shanghai at 7 a.m. yesterday to hold a solemn and unprecedented Thanksgiving Mass. At noon, a banquet was held in the Zhongshan Hall of Sheshan to welcome him. During the banquet, Cardinal Tian gave a speech, stating that the Pope's promotion of him to Cardinal Archbishop shows the lofty international status of China. Among the dozens of cardinals personally appointed by the Pope this year, one is from China. When the Pope received diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Vatican, he publicly praised China and even shouted "Long live the Republic of China! Long live President Chiang!" This is an unprecedented innovation in the Holy See. All of this can be taken as clear evidence of the Pope's admiration for our country's wise leader, his sympathy for China's new construction, and his concern for China's church. The Cardinal returned to Shanghai at 6 p.m. yesterday and will attend a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu of this city tonight. He will take a special train to Beijing the day after tomorrow to meet with the President.

It is reported that the property of Shao Shijun, Sheng Lao San, and other more than ten major traitors has not yet been inventoried. Because Shao Sheng and other traitors have a large amount of property, the property inventory of each household is said to exceed the property of all other traitors by more than 20 times. Therefore, the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau will place the inventory of this property last to show solemnity. It is expected that the inventory of all properties will be completed by the end of this month.

### Enemy Plane Wreckage Sold by the Pound

[Our Newspaper's Report] Japanese planes, which have been rampant and tyrannical for eight years, harming countless compatriots in our country, have mostly become shapeless wreckage piled up in the Jiangwan Airport.

### Tailor Induces and Defiles Teenage Girl Police Discover Clues While Searching the Room

[Our Newspaper's Report] Jin Xiuzhen, a 16-year-old woman from Wuxi, lost her parents and came to Shanghai from her hometown in January. She stayed with her cousin at No. 371, Lane 391, Jiangning Road. Through an introduction, she became a female worker at the Meihua Silk Factory on the same road, earning more than 100,000 yuan a month, which was enough to make ends meet. Yan Xiuying (18 years old), a girl who lived in Pudong, was a close friend. Last month, Yan induced her to go out and introduced her to her fellow villager Zhu Donggen (26-year-old tailor), who defiled her at the Yuanshi Yuanyuan Hotel on Jiujiang Road. One day, Zhu induced her to go to the Xinkai Road Xinzha Hotel for a tryst. While they were meeting in secret, police officers Wang Wenbin and others from the Criminal Section of the Xincheng Branch unexpectedly came to search the room. Finding their actions suspicious, they interrogated them strictly and learned the truth. They were taken to the police station together. After Jin Xiuzhen was sent to the hospital for examination, it was proven that her hymen was broken. According to the criminal law, the crime of inducing and defiling a girl under the age of 18 has been determined and will be sent to the judicial authorities today for prosecution.

### Unfilial Grandson Steals Cloth Kills

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yu Yaqing, the owner of the Datong Cotton Yarn store at No. 4, Chongrang Lane, Fuzhou Road, has a grandson named Wu Sheheng, 22 years old, who usually sets up a cloth stall in Longyou, Zhejiang. He came to Shanghai at 11 p.m. the night before and stayed at his maternal uncle Yu Yaqing's place. Wu was habitually extravagant and had previously borrowed 300,000 to 400,000 yuan from Yu, which had not been repaid, so Yu despised him. This time, he asked Wu to stay with Ji Minglang, the cook of the store (50-year-old from Chongming). At 5:20 a.m. yesterday morning, Wu quietly left and stole four large packages of cloth worth more than 3 million yuan, intending to move them onto a tricycle that had been hired in advance to wait outside the lane. Ji Minglang discovered this and argued with him, refusing to let him take it out. Wu became anxious and took out a sharp blade, slashing Ji's neck and shoulders several times. Ji was injured and fell to the ground, unconscious. The sound alerted Li Xinji, the lane watchman, who immediately locked the iron gate of the lane and called the police. Wu had nowhere to hide and returned to the Datong toilet to hide. When the police arrived, they finally found Wu, arrested him, and took him to the bureau for investigation. The injured Ji Minglang died after being sent to the hospital.

### British Foreign Firm Breaches Contract Fraud Zhongyuan Shipping Bureau Suffers Damage Lawsuit Filed with District Court

The privately-owned Zhongyuan Shipping Bureau, represented by its legal agent Gao Xinmu, ordered a 3,800-ton ocean-going ship from the British firm Mollers & Co. on November 28th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), intending to use it to replace the shipping lines previously under Japanese influence, sailing along the South China Sea and the Indian coast. At that time, the purchase price was set at 75,000 British pounds (equivalent to more than 60 million yuan in national currency), with a deposit of 15,000 British pounds to be paid first, 37,000 British pounds to be paid upon delivery of the ship, and the remaining balance to be paid in full within one month of delivery. Zhongyuan immediately paid the deposit of 15,000 British pounds as agreed. On December 10th of the same year, Zhongyuan received a notification from Mollers & Co. stating that the ship had arrived in Shanghai and requested that Zhongyuan prepare for the reception procedures and pay the second installment of 37,000 British pounds. Unexpectedly, the foreign firm broke its promise and, after receiving the payment, used the excuse that the British wartime transportation management authorities had not approved it, and the British wartime transportation bureau came forward to transport the goods, making a considerable profit. Although Zhongyuan negotiated with the foreign firm, the other party made various excuses and ultimately did not fulfill the contract. The two parties terminated the contract on March 8th of this year, and the Zhongyuan Company suffered significant losses (the ship's entire staff, such as the captain and sailors, had been hired, and the expenses were considerable). Therefore, Zhongyuan demanded that the other party compensate for the losses of 90 million yuan, but the other party still ignored it. Zhongyuan still filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court, requesting lawyers Pan Renxi, Wei Wenda, and Lu Ronggan to jointly handle the case. The district court believes that the case involves Sino-British international relations, so it attaches great importance to it and will open the trial soon. It is reported that the litigation costs paid by Zhongyuan have reached a huge sum of more than 11 million yuan, which is the largest case accepted by the Shanghai District Court after the victory. At a time when the recovery of navigation rights and the development of the civil aviation industry are being loudly promoted, it is regrettable that Chinese shipping companies have suffered such humiliation. It is reported that the shipping industry is concerned about this and will unite to support Zhongyuan.

### New Guangda Theater Vandalized Dissatisfaction with "Absurd General" Dozens Arrested in Two Places

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 9:15 p.m. last night, the New Guangda Theater on Guizhou Road was screening the silent film "Absurd General" by Chaplin. When the film was about 15 minutes from the end, the audience downstairs thought the film was too old and demanded refunds, which was echoed by those upstairs, and the order was greatly disrupted. At the same time, spectators upstairs covered the projection lens with clothing, and the situation became even more chaotic. More than 200 headsets in the theater were damaged, more than 90 chairs were smashed, and all six sets of neon colored advertisements were shattered. The advertising glass doors and windows and the large glass on the main door were mostly smashed. The total loss is estimated at more than 10 million yuan. When the incident occurred, the theater manager Han Guangyao reported to the Lao Zha Branch Bureau, and a large number of patrol teams rushed to the scene, arresting eight perpetrators. It is reported that several employees tried their best to stop the riots, but were beaten and humiliated, but the injuries were minor.

Conflict Outside Paradise

After the New Guangda was vandalized, a group of plainclothes soldiers and a small number of spectators retreated to the entrance of the Paradise of the Xianshi Company on Zhejiang Road, and there was a lot of noise. As a result, hundreds of soldiers and civilians from the Paradise also rushed down and joined the commotion. At that time, Director Shi of the Lao Zha Police Bureau rushed to the scene with a large team of police officers, and the First Patrol Team of the Garrison Headquarters also dispatched a large number of patrol teams to suppress the situation. Unexpectedly, the crowd clashed with the military police, and in the chaos, they robbed two handguns from plainclothes police officers. Therefore, the patrol team fired four shots to suppress the situation. At this time, Section Chief Lu Dagong of the Garrison Section and Team Leader Lao of the Motorcycle Team had also received the news and rushed to the scene to try their best to suppress the situation. After the incident, it was found that police officer Song Shaomei and police chief Sun Juemin were severely beaten and sent to the hospital. As for the two robbed handguns, one has been recovered, but the whereabouts of the other are unknown. More than 30 soldiers involved in the incident have been arrested.

Therefore, he did this out of hatred.

### Students from Huaiyuan Middle School in Anhui Petition in the Capital; Tragic Incident Resolved, Classes Resume as Normal

[Report from our Bengbu Correspondent] The tragic incident involving students from the Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School in Anhui being killed by the Anti-Drug Team occurred nearly a month ago, as previously reported by this newspaper. According to information from the Anhui Provincial Government, upon receiving the report at the time, the provincial government immediately dispatched He Yizhao, a section chief from the Department of Education; Shu Shuyuan, the principal of Bengbu Middle School; together with Li Mindian, the Director of the Political Department of the Eighth Pacification Zone Command; and Liao Keqin, a judge from the Military Law Office, to investigate the circumstances of the incident and comfort the families of the deceased. Subsequently, the Anti-Drug Team Twelfth Detachment provided generous funerals for the deceased students Hui Yongkun and Sun Mingde, and arranged for medical treatment for the injured Ruan Zhenhua and Li Guangyi.

Minister Chen indicated that he would provide preferential treatment to the families of the deceased students, provide medical care to the injured, and issue a warrant for Hu Zhonggui's arrest and severe punishment.

Commentary

### The Future of Middle School Art Curriculum Standards

— Wen Zhaotong

Last month, when I published an article in this newspaper titled "A Critique of the Elementary School Art Curriculum Standards," Mr. Gu Yinting, the Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, happened to be in Shanghai on official business. He spoke with me and indicated that he largely accepted some of the humble opinions I had put forth.

Continuing on from elementary school education is middle school education. Since the current revision of the "Elementary School Art Curriculum Standards" is not very ideal, what is the situation with the recently revised middle school art curriculum standards? It is necessary to bring this up.

The "Junior and Senior High School Art Curriculum Standards" were officially promulgated by the Ministry of Education in June of the 25th year of the Republic (1936). In August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), in view of the fact that art education could inspire the spirit of resistance, it was expressly ordered to increase teaching hours, with junior high schools receiving two hours per week and senior high schools receiving one hour per week. In December of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), it was revised and promulgated. If one were to compare the new and old versions, the only official change was the teaching hours, with junior high schools receiving two hours and senior high schools receiving one hour. The teaching syllabus seemed more concrete than before the revision, and more emphasis was placed on teaching the two methods of traditional Chinese painting: line drawing and ink painting. The former was the official implementation of the order from the 27th year of the Republic, while the latter was merely an adaptation to the poor material environment of the interior. Therefore, I dare say that the "Junior and Senior High School Art Curriculum Standards" have not been fundamentally revised.

Of course, in the process of national reconstruction, there is a need to revise the curriculum standards, and how should the "Art" aspect be revised? This is a problem that needs to be solved. First of all, it should be understood that junior high school is a continuation of elementary school, and senior high school is a preparation for university. Therefore, the "Drawing" subject in elementary schools should be restored to "Art," and the main goal should be to neglect technical training and emphasize the beautification of life. Junior high schools may as well also be changed to "Art," using the appreciation, expression, and research of art to enrich the requirements for the beautification of life. Senior high schools can generally continue the requirements of junior high school, but they should also pay attention to the preparation of artistic talents and guidance for specialized training, i.e., preparation and guidance for entering art vocational schools. If similar students are discovered in junior high schools, they should be guided to enter five-year art vocational schools for specialized training. In other words, the last year of junior high school and senior high school may tend towards the training of art techniques, and the subject name in senior high school can also be changed to "Art."

Secondly, middle school students' intelligence and physical strength are higher than those of elementary school students. Therefore, the teaching of the practical application of middle school art can be further emphasized, i.e., in addition to appreciation, expression, and research assignments, a "application" item can be concretely added, such as: guiding participation in various social art activities, guiding applications for various art jobs, guiding reading of art books and newspapers, etc.

Finally, the format of the middle school curriculum standards should be consistent with that of the elementary school curriculum standards, so as to facilitate the implementation by teachers.

### Pure Lodge Opera Narrative

— Zhao Jingshen

Madam Yin Junong really knows how to pick a place. On April 28th, for the second Kunqu Opera gathering of the Rainbow Society, she chose the Zhou family's garden on Haige Road, also known as Pure Lodge. This place is really nice. Going in along a small path lined with trees, there is a large hall, and we held our opera gathering in this hall. After putting down my "bedding" (opera scores), I took the opportunity to wander around. Passing through winding railings and small bridges, I saw the boat hall. Azaleas were in full bloom. It was already late spring; if I didn't come to enjoy them now, I was afraid the azaleas would wither. I said to Xitong, "How wonderful it would be if we could walk and sing, with the flute player following us, like the 'Pied Piper of Hamelin' in the fairy tale! Chunxiang wouldn't have to point things out artificially; nature itself would be our stage set. When she says, 'This is a crape myrtle trellis,' she can point to the crape myrtle trellis; when she says, 'These are azaleas,' she can point to the azaleas; although there are no green mountains, there are rockeries!" But they weren't quite so free and easy, and were still a bit reserved. In the end, the six ladies—Zhang Yuanhe, Zhang Yunhe (sisters), Gu Junong, Shen Zhuoru, Wang Yijian, and Fang Yingda—sang "Wandering in the Garden" together in the hall as the opening performance.

It was quite a coincidence that Jin Tongyin from Fudan University and his niece, Jin Chengjie, also came here with many fellow townsmen from Pinghu for a gathering. Among them, Ge Jujie was an opera friend from the Gengchun Opera Society. After Shen Zhuoru sang "The Interrupted Dream," Jujie was temporarily pulled in to sing Emperor Ming of Tang from "The Pledge of Love and Presentation of the Box," with Zhu Yaowen, the "comic relief" of Kunqu Opera, playing Yang Guifei. Next, Yingda, Yijian, and Shen Hengyi sang "A Sudden Change at the Small Feast," after which a "picnic" was held.

We brought beef, roasted gluten, smoked fish, jam, bread, beef tea, lemon tea, and jackfruit. The Pinghu townsmen also contributed some wine and platters. Everyone stood around the long table and ate, which had a unique flavor. During this break, I took another walk around Pure Lodge, this time venturing deeper. The air was especially fresh after the recent rain. I carefully walked across the stone bridge in my leather shoes, ascended the rockery, and almost slipped on the moss under my feet. I admired the Chinese-style garden, which, although not large, was extremely winding. I explored the secluded spots and sought out the scenic views, going straight to the top of the hill along the small path before contentedly returning the way I came.

When the afternoon performance hadn't started yet, Gu Zhicheng played the flute, and my sister-in-law, Cai Shuliu, and I sang "Sweeping the Flowers." Next was Gu Junong and my wife Xitong's "Pavilion Meeting." By this time, there were more and more guests. Yunhe's scheduled "Entrusting the Sword" and Yao Jilang's "Persuading to Make Up" were generously omitted, with the time allocated to allow guests from outside the society to sing as much as possible. Miss Mu Ouchu, Yi Ru, who hadn't sung opera in a long time, was invited to sing an excerpt from "Enjoying the Play." After Wang Juchuan and Wu Jichuan (the two Chuans) sang "Teasing with the Zither," Miss Liu Jingfeng sang "Questioning Her Husband," with Shuliu accompanying her. Then there was Zhou Mengxuan's "Feigning Jealousy," with Yuanhe accompanying her. After Miss Cai Linghui's "Night Flight," there was the scheduled "Broken Bridge" by Yijian, Zhuoru, Yaowen, and Peng Zhimin. The grand finale was "The Floss Pavilion" sung by Cao Zhongtao, an old opera singer from Hangzhou. He was a disciple of Yu Yaoxian, and his singing style had many gliding notes, much like Western opera singing. Even so, there were still many guests who didn't get a chance to sing, such as Madam Wang Baoqiu, Madam Pan Fangren, Madam Zhu Xizhen, Madam Ru Yiqin, and Mr. Zhao Zenghe, Mr. Liu Yunmei, Mr. Zhu Dingyi, and Mr. Mao Lianbo, who didn't get the opportunity to sing. It was truly regrettable.

This day could be said to be the Rainbow Society's grand gathering. We only have fifteen core members currently in Shanghai, but unexpectedly, the number of people who signed in was already fifty-one. The "Flute King" Xu Baiqiu also played the flute for us. There were also two Americans—Marshall and Moore—who honored us with their presence. Adding the twenty Pinghu townsmen and dozens of students from Datong University, there were at least over a hundred people listening to us sing, both inside and outside the hall (some sitting on stone benches, some on the other side of the river). This gathering of a hundred people was not announced beforehand, and some were even strangers. They happened to be strolling in the garden and also heard Kunqu Opera, which they don't usually get to hear. You could say it was a kind of fate. We were all very happy and said that Madam Yin Junong had chosen a good location.

### The Crisis of a Large Influx of Foreign Films into Shanghai

— Zhong

There are over forty movie theaters in Shanghai, and almost all of them are now showing foreign films. The daily income of foreign film companies is estimated to be around 40 to 50 million in national currency, which amounts to over 1.5 billion per month. This staggering wealth is constantly flowing out of the country, which is truly alarming! However, this 1.5 billion is only for Shanghai. Adding the financial drain given to foreign film companies by movie theaters in other major cities, such as Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, etc., it is at least over 20 billion. In other words, the total amount of money flowing out of the country due to foreign films is around 30 to 40 billion. Think about it: China's economy, after eight years of war, is already devastated, with people struggling to survive and resources depleted to the extreme. Yet, after the victory, even more money than during the war is flowing to foreign countries. How can we not expect our national currency to continue to inflate at an accelerated rate, prices to soar, resources to be depleted, speculation to run rampant, and the gap between rich and poor to widen? Although we cannot blame the recent economic panic in China entirely on the large influx of foreign films, we cannot fail to quickly find a way to plug this huge loophole.

There are two ways to plug this loophole: active and passive. Actively, we should quickly produce Chinese-made films. The call to quickly produce Chinese-made films has been going on for more than half a year, but not a single film has been produced. There are many reasons for this: first, personnel issues—the distribution of various film studios has not been completely resolved to this day, so production cannot begin; second, technical issues—the machinery and equipment have become old and unusable due to the war, and new ones need to be purchased from foreign countries as soon as possible, but there are problems with both finances and time, so the matter has been delayed until now without a solution. I hope that the various studios will be returned as soon as possible and that you will stop fighting and snatching from each other. I hope that the film companies will send people to foreign countries to purchase machinery and all equipment as soon as possible and that you will no longer hesitate and waver. Quickly producing films is a rescue effort, and we should abandon our personal interests and make every effort to sacrifice for the economic future of the country. The relevant authorities should fulfill their supervisory responsibilities and urge them fairly and impartially.

On the passive side, we should severely crack down on frivolous foreign films and not issue licenses. The number of films imported each month should be limited to a few at most. The tariffs on films should be increased. The percentage of revenue split with film companies should be reduced. This requires the responsible parties of various movie theaters to unite and, together with the government, engage in serious negotiations with foreign film companies. We are willing to use not showing foreign films as our last weapon.

Whether active or passive, we should have the greatest determination, prepare for the greatest sacrifices, and move forward bravely, no longer being timid, advancing and retreating, hesitating and wavering, and missing the opportunity. If everyone is willing to put the public interest first and their personal grudges last, any problem can be solved, and there will be a way to succeed in everything.

### Mountain City Love

— Ke Di

I weave a basket of emotions with hazy recollections and fervent memories, placing it before the face of the calendar during this springtime of celebrating victory. Calculating the days of separation from within my meditations, the ethereal, scattered dream shadows surge and swirl within my mind.

The first thing that leaps into my memory is the mountain city nestled between the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. Though it abounds in rugged roads and ramshackle houses, and lacks the glamorous façade and irresistible allure of a modern metropolis, I still yearn for it with great fervor! For it endured unspeakable suffering, and within its suffering, I spent arduous days; it rose from destruction with indomitable spirit, and within its rebirth, I forged a strong will; it nurtured the resolve to resist until the end, and within its resolve, I now witness the glorious victory with my own eyes upon the lands once lost!

Besides all this, it was also where precious historical traces of life and the warmth of friendship were gathered.

I remember several times, taking advantage of the setting sun, climbing hundreds of stone steps from Lianglukou, then walking along the dusty highway, wandering beneath the majestic Fuxing Pass (formerly known as Futuguan, the site of the Central Training Corps); and following the winding mountain road down, lingering on the banks of the Jialing River, listening to the boatmen's loud songs as they pulled the ropes, each sound piercing the tranquil sky; I relived the childhood games there, using enthusiasm to turn back the years, becoming a child full of innocence, chasing and throwing oval-shaped pebbles on the beach with my playmates. There were also the moments of sitting in the Nan District Park outside of Nanjimen, gazing at the lights on the South Bank, flickering like twinkling stars; the overlooking from the Kaixuan Bridge, watching pedestrians climb the towering stone steps as if ascending a perilous blue sky…

In those days of hardship, I felt the preciousness of friendship more keenly and learned to cherish it, especially with young companions, who, amidst the instability of wandering, tribulation, and the threat of death, could more easily open the river of hearts and evoke resonance. Therefore, in teahouses with the dim glow of triangular tung oil lamps illuminating complex and unfamiliar faces, we often gathered around square tables, drinking Tuo tea, our spirits lifted by expansive, unrestrained conversations and laughter that drowned out the pain and sorrow. Most unforgettable was the Lunar New Year's Eve of one year, when several homeless young people gathered at an inn near Huixian Bridge, pooling the money each had earned to buy a sumptuous afternoon tea, replacing the clear tea with rich, dark, steaming coffee, drinking, talking, and laughing until dawn. The next morning, New Year's Day, we stepped on a layer of pristine snow, rare in the mountain city, each counting our footprints as we set out on our respective journeys home. Enthusiasm not only drove away fatigue but also made us feel the preciousness of life even more, forgetting in our hazy sleepiness that the years spent in the mountain city had been a series of years tormented and manipulated by the black hand of war!

The mountain city I had cherished for several years is now far away with the victory. Who can be sure when the day of reunion will come? Yet I cannot forget the piece of earth I once trod, though rugged, scattered with fragrance; I cannot forget the place where the turbid waters of the Yangtze and the clear waters of the Jialing reflected each other, upon which I adorned my life's journey with laughter and tears. First, I wish to send a sincere longing from afar, wishing her well since our parting!

Old Boatman, Lu Han Made

### Strawberries

— Yang

One year, I once cultivated a good plot of land, prepared to grow strawberries, but ended up not finding the saplings. Another year, I painstakingly planted them well, but ended up harvesting nothing at all, except for seeing a few withered and weak little leaves.

However, selfishness is human nature. Because of this, my love for them has increased. Although in terms of color, fragrance, and taste, they have nothing particularly special, every year, during strawberry season, I can't help but buy a few.

Every time I read Western novels, there are many descriptions of strawberry picking, which further increases my envy. We have to buy a few strawberries from the fruit shop, unlike them who can freely pick them in the wild. How can this not be tempting?

However, because of this, their status has also become more noble. If we also had them everywhere, perhaps they wouldn't be so precious and cherished!

Serial Novel

### Double Flight (45)

— Zhao Qingge

When Madam Mo saw Zhang Xian arrive, she quickly slipped away. This was a rule Zhang Xian had set in advance: no idle people were allowed to be present during opera instruction.

Zhang Xian called Lihua and Liyun to his presence, giving each of them an opera script. Lihua took hers and stood to one side. Liyun looked at it with small eyes, reciting in a low voice with great interest:

"Complete Edition: Arrest and Release Cao..."

"What? Have you not studied? Xiaoyun!" Zhang Xian asked, widening his eyes in surprise. Then, pointing to the opera script, he corrected, "The word is not 'arrest,' but 'capture'!"

"I only recognize a few characters," Liyun replied frankly.

"And you? Xiaohua!" Zhang Xian turned to ask Lihua.

Hua flipped through a few pages of the opera script, nodded, and said nothing.

"Alright, then! You should first look at the characters I circled in red. If there are any you don't recognize, come ask me, and I'll tell you." Zhang Xian said, quietly glancing at Lihua. He thought to himself: This child's temper is indeed not small. Turning back to Liyun, he said: "Since you don't recognize the characters, just follow me and recite, but you must remember it firmly and recite it back to me tomorrow. If you can't recite it, I will punish you."

Liyun responded with a sound.

Zhang Xian began by teaching Liyun, from spoken lines to singing. He taught her with dramatic gestures, tapping the beat on the table with his fingers. He had Liyun learn the role of Chen Gong in "Capturing and Releasing Cao." It is said that starting to learn male roles always begins with "Capturing and Releasing Cao" because it is easy. However, Liyun was indeed not clever enough; whether it was the spoken lines or the singing, she had to be taught each sentence three or four times before she could learn it even slightly accurately. This not only made things difficult for Liyun but also for Zhang Xian. Later, Zhang Xian became impatient and had to stop at a small passage, telling Liyun to practice on her own and then come back for more teaching to Lihua.

Lihua had already read half of the opera script. This was "Yutang Chun" ("The Story of Su San"), and although she also did not recognize some of the characters, she became interested in the story. She did not follow Zhang Xian's instructions to only look at the characters circled in red; she read all the characters, even those that were not circled.

"Xiaohua, are there any characters you don't recognize?" Zhang Xian stood up, stretched, took a sip of water, and then pulled Lihua over, saying.

"No." Lihua solemnly shook off Zhang Xian's hand and answered him.

Zhang Xian encountered another hurdle. He sat down awkwardly, saying to himself in admiration, "Indeed, she comes from a good background. At such a young age, she already knows how to be polite."

"Then, you should also do like Xiaoyun did just now: I say a sentence, you say a sentence; I sing a line, you sing a line; and you must learn from me with the same tune and rhythm, beat by beat. When learning, you must carefully listen to how I speak; you say it the same way; how I sing; and you also sing it the same way. After we're done, tomorrow you will recite it all over again, exactly the same as how I taught you today. If you make a mistake, you will be punished." Zhang Xian said with a hint of threat, thinking: If Lihua doesn't know how, he can use punishment to subdue her stubbornness.

At first, Lihua couldn't open her mouth no matter what. She looked at Zhang Xian's strange gestures and expressions, finding them both annoying and hateful. No matter how much Zhang Xian said and sang, she simply refused to follow him. Zhang Xian became anxious and shouted.

"My young lady! Can you please open your golden mouth?"

Lihua finally couldn't resist any longer and had to open her mouth shyly in a low voice. This first sound surprised Zhang Xian, because not only was it accurate, but it was so good that it sounded like someone with experience. The tune was loud and melodious, her pronunciation was clear, and her delivery was fluent. Compared to Liyun, there was a world of difference.

"Suffering!" After Lihua cried out in a trembling voice of sorrow and despair, she then cried "Hey, ya..."!

This cry was precisely the mournful sound that Lihua's heart wanted to call out; this weeping was precisely the grief she wanted to vent! She cried very naturally without any affectation. She cried even more naturally! She forgot that this was a play; she forgot that she was crying out in the guise of Su San! She only felt that what she was expressing now was herself. At this moment, she happened to have a belly full of bitterness and a heart full of grievance; so she cried out, she wept! She mixed the play and life together, and she shed real tears!

"Xiaohua, this is a play! There's no need to worry about the ancients." Zhang Xian patted Lihua, saying. He mistook Lihua for being moved by the play. "Now, follow me and learn to sing again." After speaking, he cleared his throat and began to sing in a low voice. After singing, he told Lihua: "This is called Erhuang Yaoban, remember! This is Su San's first piece of singing after she comes onstage."

Lihua said nothing, mechanically following Zhang Xian sentence by sentence. Although it was not as natural as before, the tragic atmosphere of this past tune could still match her current mood, so the singing was still beautiful. She almost didn't need Zhang Xian to teach her any sentence a second time. Especially in the spoken parts, Zhang Xian's pronunciation was not as clear as hers. Because she had a pure Beijing accent, crisp and delicate. In addition, because she knew how to read, it was especially easy for her to learn.

Zhang Xian also taught Lihua a section of Fan Erhuang Manban, which was considered a smooth completion of the first day's lesson. Finally, he told her that when they learned stage movements in the afternoon, she would also have to memorize the lyrics and spoken lines she had just learned because the stage movements had to match the lyrics and spoken lines. Then Zhang Xian called Liyun over again and asked her:

"Xiaoyun, have you practiced enough at this time?"

Liyun did not answer because in fact, she had only been paying attention to Lihua just now and had completely forgotten to practice her own part. Her impression of the singing passages and spoken lines that she had learned was already very vague, so she was very embarrassed at this time.

Zhang Xian had no choice but to teach Liyun again from beginning to end. Finally, he warned her:

"If you still can't do it tomorrow, you will be beaten!"

Liyun puffed up her small eyes and made a sound "哼". She was very disappointed in her heart: she originally thought that learning opera was fun, but she didn't know it would be so difficult. Moreover, Zhang Xian wanted to "beat" her at every turn, which made her very frightened. She thought about not learning, but she was afraid that Auntie Weng wouldn't allow it, so she couldn't help but resolve to work hard. But if she did, she would have no time to play at all, so she couldn't help but get annoyed.

In the afternoon, Shi Yulou began teaching them stage movements. This was more interesting for Liyun, who liked to move her hands and feet, jumping and hopping. However, because she moved too much, and she wasn't familiar with the lyrics and spoken lines, the two couldn't coordinate, making Shi Yulou both amused and annoyed! He had to teach her haphazardly.

When it was Lihua's turn, she was still shy about raising her hands and feet at first. When she was forced to, she moved rhythmically and orderly according to Shi Yulou. Because she was clever and learned quickly, Shi Yulou taught her more energetically and earnestly.

After that, Lihua and Liyun learned and practiced in this way every day. In less than half a month, Lihua had learned the entire "Yutang Chun", but Liyun had only learned one-third of the entire "Capturing and Releasing Cao". Usually, Lihua also helped Liyun teach her to recognize the characters in the lyrics and spoken lines. But unfortunately, Liyun's talent was limited, and she could never catch up with Lihua's speed. Therefore, she was often slapped on the hand as punishment. Lihua had also been beaten, that was when she was too lazy to speak, or when she was annoyed with Zhang Xian and deliberately disobeyed him, she had been beaten a few times by Zhang Xian.

### Gold Certificate Transactions Sparse Yesterday, Government Bonds Suspended Due to Special Circumstances, A Certain Bull Market Crushes Over a Million

Yesterday, the gold certificate market was even more erratic, its movements entirely dependent on how positions were adjusted. There was no sign of improvement in the morning, and overnight bulls continued to sell at high prices, gradually declining from around 1.8 million. Around 10 o'clock, it was around 1.79 million. The Bank of China allocated over a hundred strips at a price of 1.795 million. After the entry, the money market eased, and actual sales were still strong. Near noon, it rebounded to 1.82 million and then stabilized slightly. The afternoon saw some flatness, and transactions were sparse due to the holidays. The result showed little change from the previous closing. Gilt was 192,000, sycee silver was 1,900, silver dollars were slightly stable, the underground discount rate for money was slightly evened out, and the interest rate was from 1.5 to 1.8 cents.

Foreign currency, US dollars, remained strong and stable, fluctuating slightly between 2315 yuan and 2335 yuan, with gold arbitrage at around 771 yuan, with some differences. It was slightly stable at noon, and transactions were limited in the afternoon. The result showed a slight increase of five yuan from the previous closing. Hong Kong notes were mediocre, and the result showed a slight drop in old notes. Indian exchange was 528 yuan, and Hong Kong exchange was 430 yuan with supply. US exchange was stable.

Government bonds were again suspended yesterday due to special circumstances. A certain firm on the seventh floor, which had purchased 1.02 million in face value bonds at high prices the day before, refused to complete the transaction, citing a difference of 1,000 yuan in the purchase price, causing the industry to be implicated and stopping public trading. As a result, all bonds had no formal trading. The C-series loan rose from 5650 yuan to 6000 yuan, resulting in an increase of over 300 yuan from the previous closing. Miscellaneous bonds had varying times, with A and B rising 100 yuan, D flat, and E falling 150. Chinese stocks continued to be weak, with hot and cold stocks reversed. Wing On Textile was at a high of 5750 yuan and a low of 5450 yuan, American Asiatic was at 4250 yuan and a low of 3980 yuan, King Fook retreated from 295 yuan to 270 yuan, New Kwong retreated from 280 yuan to 260 yuan, Kwan Hing retreated from 225 yuan to 203 yuan. Other small and medium-sized unpopular stocks rose from their lows. This was because the exchange had recently reopened, and the general sentiment was to abandon hot stocks for cold ones, with arbitrage being quite active, leading to this. Compared to the previous closing, the hot stocks Wing On Textile, American Asiatic, New Kwong, and Kwan Hing all fell slightly, King Fook rose slightly, and the colder small and medium-sized stocks, except for Wing Fung which did not change, all recovered half to one-tenth. Veteran stocks were inactive, and the market was weak. The afternoon saw fewer transactions due to the holiday. The foreign stock market continued to be mediocre, with stocks being bought and sold selectively. Generally, there were still sellers of hot stocks, while cheaper stocks had buyers, resulting in a balance. Compared to the previous closing, Ewo Silk, Union Paper, Asia Industries, Canton Wharf all saw slight declines, while Ewo Brewery and Shanghai Steel saw slight increases.

### The Tung Yih Godown Receipt Dispute Remains Unresolved – The Consequences of Robbing Yarn

[Our Correspondent] Due to various reasons during the period of the occupation, Tung Yih Spinning Mill had many godown receipts that had not been cleared. However, the yarn and cloth inventory covered by these receipts had already been forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes. Before the victory, they had already cleared batches of receipts, reaching settlements with the holders and paying them at a discount. Currently, there are still many holders of 16-pound coarse cloth godown receipts who have not reached a settlement. They have registered with the Cotton Cloth Industry Association and entrusted them to negotiate on their behalf. The person in charge of the association has contacted the factory multiple times, but without progress. Some of the impatient receipt holders have repeatedly questioned the factory, believing that the factory is already shipping and operating, but has not cleared the outstanding receipts, making them feel uneasy. The factory has presented documents issued by the enemy when they were forcibly purchased as a defense. Both sides are still deadlocked. According to sources from the receipt holders, the documents issued by the enemy are very vague and do not specify the type of goods, believing that the receipt holders should not bear the consequences. They also claim that some of the receipt holders are from the rear area and are completely unaware of the situation. The factory has previously stated that the forcibly purchased yarn and cloth did include all goods, as evidenced by the accountant's audit report. It is rumored that both parties will nominate responsible persons to reopen negotiations within the next few days.

### Coal Allocation Unattractive to Buyers – Six Reasons

[Our Correspondent] The Fuel Management Committee of this city issued another batch of coal allocation for production enterprises in May, following April. The allocation price remained largely unchanged, but the recipients were not as enthusiastic as in April. The reasons are: (1) The selling price of production allocation is higher than that of merchants, and often the coal resold by merchants is cheaper; (2) Except for small retailers, the goods must be picked up in Pudong, and recipients are not clear about the quality and procedures; (3) Industrial decline and limited electricity supply. Factories in the former French Concession are not allowed to operate motors after 5 pm daily, further narrowing sales; (4) Diesel substitution is less costly; (5) The time limit for payment of the allocation is shortened; (6) Industry associations restrict member factories from reselling. Due to these reasons, it is said that the coal allocated to industries such as rubber and dyeing last month has not yet been fully collected.

### New British Products

London, April 4 (British Information Service) – The British glass industry is about to complete many new glass products, including transparent bricks, doors, inlays, and even tow ropes. In the future, it will also supply the world with glass tables, tubes, belts, backs, arches, straps, bracelets, shoes, and boots. A manufacturer in northern England is producing the world's cheapest small car, the six-horsepower Kendall four-seater, which can travel 60 miles on one gallon of gasoline and has a speed of 60 miles per hour. The price per vehicle is £200.

### Wool Fabrics Made with Fruit Juice

New Invention by Australian Scientists

Canberra, April 3 (Agence France-Presse) – This correspondent has learned that Australian scientists have recently discovered a type of fruit growing in Australia that can be used to extract a chemical atom from its juice, called "Baping," which can be used to manufacture soft and shiny silk-like wool fabrics. The textile industry here expects that this type of fabric will be produced and sold in large quantities, as light-as-a-feather clothing is most needed in tropical areas. Thanks to this chemical invention, this type of fabric can absorb and evaporate moisture, and its use will certainly be great.

### Flying Tiger General Chennault – Establishes Sino-American Industrial Company – Capital Reaches 100 Million Yuan – Focuses on Import and Export Business

[Our Correspondent] This newspaper previously reported that Flying Tiger General Chennault planned to organize a company to engage in commerce. It is now known that this plan has been concretized. Its name is Sino-American Industrial Corporation, a joint venture organized by Chinese and American personnel, with a capital of 100 million yuan, shared equally by China and the United States. The American half is the responsibility of Mr. Chennault, while the Chinese half has also been fully subscribed. A promoters' meeting was held in this city yesterday, chaired by Mr. Li Mingyang. All progress plans have been agreed upon. It is said that the company is dedicated to supporting factories, revitalizing industry, improving agricultural production, assisting in transportation and sales, and increasing farmers' production, in order to fulfill the goal of building the country through industry. Its business scope is extremely broad, including (1) investment in improving rural native products and rural welfare; (2) investment and management of factories and industries; (3) investment and operation of various enterprises; (4) promotion and operation of domestic and foreign trade and transportation; (5) design of various production industries and supply of machinery and raw materials; (6) investment in various securities; (7) operation of warehouses and all trust businesses; (8) investment in other various businesses. The head office is located in Shanghai, and branch offices or offices may be established in major commercial ports. In addition to Li Mingyang, the Chinese promoters include Wang Lihang, Ren Jin, Zhu Xuefan, Xu Caicheng, Liao Gongzhu, and more than thirty others.

### Shirting Actively Sold

No Market After Dragon Boat Festival Yesterday Yesterday was the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival. The Paradise and Cotton Cloth Association markets were open in the morning, but transactions were very few. Shirting was actively sold by northern merchants and others, and the market price rose by 500 to 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to tight money, there were no transactions on this street, so the market price slightly decreased by 300 to 500 yuan. There were no transactions in the afternoon.

### Money Exchange Shops Uniformly Renamed Money Exchange Stores

[Our Correspondent] There are many money exchange shops in this city. Except for a few that have applied to the Central Bank and been approved to trade in foreign currencies and gold, the rest have been strictly prohibited by the Shanghai Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance from engaging in speculative transactions and trading in foreign currencies. It is now known that the Shanghai Finance Bureau, for the sake of price management, has drafted several rules, which have been agreed upon by the Social Affairs Bureau. In the future, money exchange shops will be uniformly referred to as money exchange stores, and must obtain a license from the Finance Bureau before they are allowed to operate.

### Current Situation of Hog Bristle Export – Tianjin and Shanghai Production Losses, Chongqing Production Barely Covers Costs

There have been continuous business transactions in hog bristle exports to the UK and the US recently. It is reported that the Sichuan Production Company sold over 1,200 boxes to the US in May for delivery in New York, priced at US$3.25 per pound for 27 combination boxes (per pound price), US$2.15 for 2-inch bristles, 15 shillings and 8 pence (purchased by an American merchant on behalf of the UK), and US$1.05 for bundles. Another 150 boxes of 27 bristles were sold to the British government last month for delivery in London, priced at 15 shillings and 8 pence. It is said that the recent New York hog bristle prices show that Tianjin's 43-box longer combination can be sold for up to US$4.00, Chongqing bristles with 27 combination boxes can be sold for US$3.25, and Shanghai bristles, due to their inferior quality, are only sold for between US$1.00 and US$2.00. Based on the current domestic prices, shipping and sales from Tianjin and Shanghai to the US result in losses, while Chongqing barely covers costs.

### Indian Glycerin Arrives

US and Philippine Caustic Soda Export Ban

A large batch of Indian glycerin has arrived, causing the price of triangular glycerin to be lowered by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The market price of Indian glycerin is quoted as high as 180,000 yuan. [Another report] The inventory of caustic soda in this city is thin, and sales have been extensive. Previously, New York and the Philippines had both banned exports, and merchants in this city had secretly tried their best to buy it. Now that the US ban has been confirmed and the import of caustic soda is hopeless, it has become the target of raw material merchants. Raw material merchants consider caustic soda to be the commodity with the largest sales volume, and also the most volatile. The highest price in Shanghai was around 2 million yuan per 300-kilogram barrel, and the lowest price was only 180,000 yuan. It is also said that customers from Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have come to Shanghai to purchase. General speculation is that this round of price increases may exceed the previous peak.

### Exporters Hope for Reduced Export Taxes

According to Mr. Karl S. Chen, manager of the merchants' Lai Wai foreign firm, recently, our country's trade with South America has gradually returned to its pre-war state. Last week, the firm had a batch of light bulbs worth US$80,000 shipped for export. The cost of each light bulb is 30 yuan, plus an export tax of 5 yuan, so not only is there no profit, but there is also a loss. Therefore, at a time when the export industry is extremely difficult, it is hoped that the government will reduce export taxes and broaden the scope of tax-free goods to encourage exports. The import taxes of countries such as the UK and the US are generally between 50% and 70%, and some are even as high as 90% or more. Therefore, it is also hoped that the government authorities will negotiate with the UK and the US to reduce them.

### The Dyestuff Market Varies – Basic Colors and Grounds Are Very Strong – Manufacturers Are Not Eager to Order

[Our Correspondent] The dyestuff market has seemed calm recently. De Fu Foreign Firm continues to distribute goods. The number of distributed indanthrene and direct dyes is still considerable, while vulcanized yuan is very tight. Recently, TBO yuan has been distributed. Hengxin Foreign Firm has not accepted orders for the past month or two. Its previous orders are arriving one after another, and a small amount of vulcanized yuan is also being delivered. Therefore, the yuan color market has recently turned from strong to flat. Its American goods, 693 yuan, were 900,000 yuan in early May, rose to 1 million yuan when cleared customs in mid-May, and have recently returned to 1 million yuan. Dye factories are accepting orders well, and there seems to be a positive outlook. The price increase of TBO yuan is more intense. The reason for this is that this brand has been unpopular for a long time, but recently there has been a sudden increase in demand. Therefore, although De Fu has distributed goods, the price has instead increased. It is currently standing at between 835,000 yuan, which is about 150,000 yuan higher than mid-May. NLA yuan has been almost out of stock for the past ten days, and there are no transactions on the market. It was quoted as high as 1.12 million yuan in mid-May. This brand is very good, but it seems to have been overshadowed since the American goods, 693 yuan, became popular. However, manufacturers are still willing to pay a higher price to buy it. The body of TBO yuan is still acceptable, but it is a blue-green color, and its sales are ultimately narrower. Moreover, De Fu's inventory is also not large. From a general perspective, the yuan color market seems to have a strong foundation. Bleaching powder has been fatigued since orders from foreign firms such as Xiehe and Meihe arrived. The price in early May was 200,000 yuan, but it has now fallen to between 150,000 and 160,000 yuan. Indanthrene and sunfast dyes exceeded 20 million yuan at the end of last year, but now 9 million yuan is still rarely accepted. The reason for this is not due to De Fu's large distribution, but due to the continuous arrival of American sunfast dyes. There are few of these American goods that come from Hengxin, their sales agent, but many are resales of orders placed in the interior before the victory. The exchange rate for these orders was much cheaper than it is now, so it is appropriate to sell more at a small profit. According to this situation, it seems difficult to be optimistic about sunfast blue. In the past two or three months, the dyestuff route of dye factories cannot be said to have been without improvement, but in the end, they are afraid of the price drop of foreign goods and dare not buy too much, let alone hoard them. Therefore, except for a few mainstream goods such as vulcanized yuan, where foreign firms are unwilling to continue accepting orders, a tired outlook is a common psychology. Therefore, whenever news of imported goods arriving is heard, the price is bound to fall. Sunfast blue, bleaching powder, and caustic soda are all typical examples. However, low-end and fast-selling goods can quickly trend upward again, and vulcanized yuan is also one of them. Currently, most of the goods sold by dye factories themselves are light-colored goods. The goods produced by dye factories are still concentrated in basic color and blue-colored goods. Although there are more factories operating, sales have not developed much. The silkworm season on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway has diminished in color, and acceptance is mediocre. Tianjin merchants have the impression that their buying is unfavorable due to incompatible prices, and the route to Hubei is also sluggish. The future is not optimistic, and it is said that many factories are planning to reduce work and save expenses to overcome this difficulty.

International Knowledge

### Who Will Win the Third World War?

— Translated and Narrated by Zuo Xi

From the "Second World War," it is easy to associate with the "Third World War." The recent evolution of the international situation makes people even more concerned about the arrival of the "Third World War." Indeed, many people have been talking about this matter recently. The British Labour Party's newspaper recently published an editorial stating that the Third World War is no longer just empty talk, but has the possibility of evolving into reality. It says that the Soviet Union harbors great suspicion towards the United States and Britain, and if this suspicion continues to progress at the current rate, it will soon reach the point of explosion, and once it explodes, it can instantly raze our world to the ground.

On the other hand, the American "International Digest" published a moving article by Charles Burns in its July issue, entitled "Who Will Win the Third World War?"

At the beginning, he made a definitive statement: the victor of the Third World War will not be the United States, which promotes democracy; in other words, unless the United States abandons democracy first and adopts a military dictatorship similar to Hitler's, it will certainly fail in future wars. Because in the atomic bomb war, whoever strikes first wins. Only armed nations can take such action, which is impossible for the democratic United States.

If the disputes between the powers today cannot be resolved through political means and must be settled with weapons, then the lineup of the two sides will be like this: the United States against the Soviet Union—the rest of the countries will join either side according to their own interests.

If the future conflict is an atomic war, it will be difficult to distinguish between the victor and the vanquished, just as it is impossible to distinguish between one pile of stones and another.

The scene of the future war is probably like this: at a high temperature of 21.2 million degrees Fahrenheit, the entire city melts into a mixture of cement, glass, and steel. Factories collapse completely, and people and machines turn into sparks in a giant cloud of smoke. One bomb explosion simultaneously kills hundreds of thousands or even millions of people and animals. People who are several miles away from the explosion site, even if they do not die today, may not be able to survive tomorrow. Strange burns will later be found on their skin, which cannot be cured, because the patients are still affected by other radioactivity: diarrhea, sore tongue, bleeding without wounds, hair loss, loose teeth that can be pulled out immediately, and the collapse of white blood cells, making it impossible to resist germs. What do scientists say about the Third World War?

Dr. Wu Zeng, who won the Nobel Prize, said: "The future is unpredictable. In fact, future history often cannot last long. Our technical wars are extremely terrible. If we engage in this kind of war, there will be no survivors." He also said: "Our conclusion is: when the enemy is able to freely choose the method of throwing atomic bombs, there is no effective defense against the explosion of atomic bombs." What do military experts say?

Army General Marshall fully acknowledges the scientists' most pessimistic arguments. In his final report to the President, he categorically stated: "The outbreak of the Third World War is like a thunderbolt attack," and predicted that this attack would be launched from afar with rockets exceeding the speed of sound. He warned that this lightning-fast attack would give the leisurely and peaceful United States no time to prepare for war. He believes that if the United States wants to defeat the enemy, it must establish strong fortresses and a peacetime-trained army of 4 million men capable of fighting immediately.

In theory, perhaps the United States could become the only country capable of coping with the Third World War: the United States could turn the entire country into an armed camp, and all islands into outer fortresses. The United States could send spies to infiltrate military stations in all countries. However, all of this would be difficult to pass in the democratic Congress. Only after the United States adopts a military dictatorship can there be hope for the realization of the above-mentioned possibilities.

In addition to this, if the United States wants to prevent the Third World War, it must follow the following path: use delaying tactics to prevent the outbreak of a future war, and elect people with the determination to promote world peace and support the United Nations organization as members of Congress. If we can delay a world war for ten or twenty years, then international cooperation will certainly be able to advance further, and perhaps a more advanced international organization than the United Nations organization can be produced.

In short, must mankind lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot, or will we only tend towards the path of destruction?

### Radar and the Moon

— By D. Daez, Translated by Na Jie

During the Second World War, "radar" played a very important role, second only to the "atomic bomb." Warships sailing in the dark or in dense fog can use radar to detect enemy ships many miles away, and then fire cannons, which can almost be 100% accurate. In addition, radar can also be used to detect enemy aircraft and coastal defenses. As for the principle of radar usage, radar waves are first emitted into space. When the waves move forward and encounter obstacles, they will fold back and generate fluctuations in the recording device. A specially trained person can see the enemy's movements from above and immediately take appropriate measures, thereby killing the enemy. Radar accelerated the victory of the United Nations.

While radar has many uses in wartime, it will certainly have even greater uses in peacetime, and the future is simply unlimited. For example, recently, radar has been successfully used to detect the moon, becoming a prelude to humans further understanding the moon and even exploring the moon. On January 10, 1946, the US Army Air Station in Belmar, New Jersey, emitted radar waves to the moon on a moonlit and windy night. The distance between the Earth and the Moon is 238,000 miles. The waves moved forward at a speed of 186,000 miles per second (equal to the speed of light), and then folded back to Earth, taking 2.4 seconds. At that time, the recording device emitted a light buzzing sound, and white ripples appeared on the black recording board. From these ripples, it is possible to infer the topography and formation of the moon.

This is not the first time that humans have tried to explore the moon. Previously, some people advocated using searchlights to shine extremely strong light on the moon, and then using sophisticated telescopes to observe, but the results were unsuccessful. Later, some people advocated radiating radio waves to the moon, but in the airspace 30 miles above the Earth, there is an ionosphere created by sunlight, and radio waves cannot pass through it, so they fold back when they reach 30 miles, and the moon is 238,000 miles away from the Earth! Thanks to the invention of radar, these difficulties have been overcome.

The attempt by humans to build rockets to explore the moon has approached the point of realization from fantasy, and the success of radar detection of the moon can be said to be good news for adventurers.

### The Transformation of European Politics

— Written by Stanley High, Translated by Jia Na

On July 5, 1945, a momentous event with far-reaching impact occurred in European politics. Was it the collapse of Germany? Or the surrender of Japan? Everyone knows it was not. If readers are eager to know exactly what this major event was, I can say it straightforwardly: It was the Labor Party's victory in the British election.

As the Labor Party came to power and the Conservative Party stepped down, amidst the comings and goings of British politics, people often mistakenly believe that Britain will henceforth lean left, and that Anglo-Soviet relations will inevitably become closer than during the Conservative Party's rule. This is because the Labor Party advocates socialism, and isn't socialism practically the fraternal twin of communism? This notion is specious, even counterproductive, so I dare say: it is a misconception.

The following are the views expressed by American writer Stanley High on this issue, in an article titled: "Will the British Labour Party Turn Europe Away from Communism?" published in the May issue of "Reader's Digest."

In my (Stanley High's) opinion, world communism and the British Labour government are on a collision course: if the Labour government succeeds, the prestige and power of international communism may gradually decline; conversely, if the leaders and policies of the Labour government fail, then the momentum of communism may expand.

I hold this belief for two reasons: first, because communists themselves hold this view. Since the Labor Party's moderate democratic reform policies began to take shape, international communists, in their newspapers and strategies, have revealed that the target they aim to overthrow is none other than the British Labor Party! Second, because the various changes that have taken place in European politics have already begun to confirm this point. In the nine months since the British Labor government came to power, it has not bolstered but rather weakened the power of international communism, and has restored the inherent beliefs of moderate parties in Europe that had long been losing ground.

The Labor Party's victory in the election and assumption of power on July 5 has had a very significant and far-reaching impact. The politically astute Dr. Noel Burg said, "The liberated nations of Europe almost immediately recognized the British Labour Party's platform as an excellent alternative to communism."

Since the British Labor Party came to power, six liberated European countries have held free elections. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party has not won in any of the six countries, and their gains have been far smaller than predicted by most qualified observers.

The transformation of European politics due to the Labor Party's success in Britain is no longer limited to Western Europe, but has begun to extend to Southern and Eastern Europe. The fact that this phenomenon is even occurring in Eastern Europe, a bastion of communism, is truly remarkable! "The Times" said, "This is the biggest political news in Europe. The rise of anti-communist forces in countries such as Hungary, Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, and Yugoslavia was almost unimaginable, yet the impossible has become possible."

The current political trend in Europe is not just anti-communist. In fact, as the "New York Times" said, "It is a revival of democracy." European people, who had gradually lost faith in democracy, are now changing their beliefs.

This change in the world situation is not unexpected to international communists. Marx and Lenin have used thousands upon thousands of words to earnestly advise their communist successors that the greatest threat to communism is not unscrupulous capitalism, because capitalism itself contains elements that contribute to its own disintegration. The Communist Party's number one enemy is the Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party, as well as all figures who oppose violent revolution and advocate striving for the masses through reform methods.

When international communists cannot prevent the rise of this movement, they try to participate in it, thereby expanding their power and, at the appropriate time, subverting it from within. For example, Lenin personally prescribed this method in order to overthrow the first British Labor government in 1924.

During the British elections last year, the British Communist Party had already anticipated that the Labor Party might win. In order to implement its consistent strategy, it twice requested to unite with the Labor Party, and was twice rejected. After the election, they issued a third call, and were rejected a third time. In its letter rejecting the Communist Party's request, the Labor Party said, "The experience of the past twenty-five years has made the National Executive Committee of this party deeply aware that the Communist Party's current plans and long-term goals are fundamentally different from those of the Labor Party."

The Communist Party's newspapers were extremely indignant because its plan failed. The American Communist Party's "Daily Worker" said, "In fact, the British Labour Party seems to have told the socialist parties of Europe: If you sever ties with the Communist Party, you are guaranteed to receive British support. This is the core of Bevin's policy."

Therefore, this movement led by Britain has become a major political issue for Moscow. So when Bevin and Vyshinsky met in the Security Council, in fact, they represented not only two great powers, but more importantly, two fundamentally different ways of life. The real dispute is the dispute between socialism and communism. Anyone who understands the trends of the post-war world knows that the most acute struggle of political thought at the moment is between the two philosophies mentioned above.

Indeed, the founding fathers of these two philosophies were both Marx's doctrines, but the biggest difference between them is that socialism has continuously inclined towards liberalism, while communism has become totalitarian in nature. The British Labor Party's victory in the election was the spark that ignited this ideological war.

That is why this article stated at the outset: The British Labor Party's victory in the election was a major event with far-reaching impact on European politics.

### The U.S. Plans to Solve the World Housing Shortage

— Xi

The United States, like other countries, is experiencing the most severe housing shortage in its history. Previously, Mayor Wyatt of Louisville, Kentucky, was ordered by President Truman to be responsible for planning a solution to the housing problem in the United States. After receiving the order, Wyatt devoted all his energy to this problem. He suggested mobilizing most of the American construction industry to build 1.7 million new homes within two years. Due to the consequences left by the failure of the American "New Deal" before the war, and the suspension of housing construction during the war, his difficult problems are numerous. People in the construction industry have loudly attacked him and his policies because he has severely restricted their 450 billion yuan construction plan, and the construction industry has therefore suffered a major blow.

But Wyatt disregarded everything and, with resolute measures, stipulated that only low-value houses are allowed to be built. Wyatt's plan is to build houses using six methods, and divide the houses into four grades, and predetermine the number of houses of each grade to be built according to the needs of the two years. The American construction industry has been able to meet the need for high-end houses, but the gap in building inexpensive houses is still large. Wyatt's goal is to change this situation; in other words, he hopes to reduce high-end houses and build more inexpensive houses to meet the needs of the general public. To achieve this goal, he must rely on the construction of mobile homes and other completely new and untested methods.

At the same time, there is a cheapest and fastest construction method called "on-site construction method," which can build a large number of houses in a short period of time. The most famous architect who advocates this construction method is Bohannon of San Francisco. His method is to first build a light wooden frame on or near the open space where the house is to be built, and then put the boards, beams, pillars, floors, etc. required for the house building on it, and then use a road roller to tamp the foundation of the house, and finally use nails to nail the various ready-made wood materials together to build the house frame. In 1944, Bohannon used this method to build 700 houses near Oakland, California, with a total working time of 693 hours.

Wyatt believes that the "on-site construction method" and the "mobile home construction method" are two effective methods to achieve his housing construction goals. But he believes that most of the new houses will be built by thousands of traditional small-scale construction companies in the country. Therefore, he also encourages another construction method that can be adopted by small-scale construction companies. This method takes the ready-made house's important equipment—such as bathrooms, kitchens, and heating equipment—as the core, and builds the house around it. This ready-made house equipment can solve the expensive and complicated indoor equipment problems. At present, the production of this ready-made house equipment is extremely slow, but at least one large-scale industrial company is preparing for mass production. Wyatt plans to build 2.7 million new houses in two years. If this plan is successful, then the industry of building inexpensive houses will lay a foundation, and it can be promoted and developed from this. If this is the case, then not only can the housing shortage in the United States be solved, but also the housing shortages around the world may be solved easily.

### Interesting News

Soon, fresh fruits such as apples and oranges can still be kept fresh weeks or months after they are picked, just like when they were just picked. The method is very simple: wrap the fruit with a special film (the thinnest is only one ten-thousandth of an inch thick). Even easily perishable apples can be kept for more than eighteen months.

Matches that are damp naturally cannot strike a flame, but almighty science has already solved this shortcoming. A match that has been placed in a damp room for several months, or floated on the surface of the water for twenty-four hours, can still strike a flame. Scientists have spent a hundred years researching this kind of "waterproof" match, and it has only recently been successfully completed. This new type of match has been immersed in six different solutions, and each solution applies a transparent film on the match. It was originally used by the army in humid climates and by the navy in lifeboats during the war. It will probably be available on the market in a few months.

### Who Is the Richest Person in the World

— Zhu

The richest woman in the United States—perhaps in the world—Wilkes, is the daughter of Wall Street tycoon Hetty Green. Her total wealth amounts to US$100.01 million.

The most precious part of her property is a collection of jewelry worth $20 million, including a golden helmet adorned with emerald peacock feathers, a diamond-encrusted chastity belt, and a box of unset jewels. The income she receives from her husband's estate and her own property is $5 million per year, which is more than King George VI of England's pre-war annual salary of $4.5 million. The current income of the King of England is less than this amount. She can mobilize $10 million in cash within 24 hours.

Mrs. Wilkes's life is very regular. She gets up early every day and eats a fairly rich breakfast (including fruits, eggs, toast, coffee, etc.), and drives to the office (a real estate company) at 10:00 in the morning to work.

When someone asked Mrs. Wilkes who she planned to leave her property to, she just shook her head and said nothing.

Current Situation of the Gambling Kingdom

### Monte Carlo Is Still Safe and Sound

— Translated by Nan

There is a very small principality on the Mediterranean coast in southeastern France, which is Monaco, known as the "Gambling Kingdom." The country covers an area of ​​only 20 square kilometers, has a population of more than 25,000, has a mild climate, and beautiful scenery. It is a summer resort. The town of Monte Carlo in the country has a huge gambling company. People in Europe and even the world who love gambling all "flock to it." The eight-year world war has changed the landscape and the map. In this changeable world, what is the current situation of Monte Carlo? I think readers would like to hear about it.

American journalist Acheson recently visited this small "utopian" country, and afterwards published an article in "Life Magazine" describing the past and present situation of the gambling kingdom. I will excerpt the main points below.

The first point to tell readers is that Monte Carlo is "business as usual." Even when the war was at its hottest, and even when stray shells from air raids affected the Principality of Monaco, the casino did not hang up the "no war" sign.

Just like the casinos in various countries and regions all have elegant names, the Monte Carlo Grand Casino also has a falsely named nickname, called "Seawater Bath Tent." This name was taken by the founder of the casino, Brock, 80 years ago. Someone asked him why he named it so inappropriately. The old comedian said, "Isn't it just to make the customers look better?"

During the war, the ivory ball on the roulette wheel of the Monte Carlo Casino never stopped, but in the comings and goings, the faces of the customers have changed significantly. Although there are Germans, Italians, French, British, Americans...there are not many nobles, wealthy gentlemen, luxurious wives, and beautiful girls. The characters who are active there have changed into black market nouveau riche who made war fortunes.

But it would be an exaggeration to say that the war had no impact on Monaco. For example, once a group of warships came to visit the country, and unfortunately, all the cash on the ship disappeared. This incident made the officers on the ship furious, and they declared that if the lost money was not found, they would bombard the copper roof of the Monte Carlo Casino. Later, this matter was finally concluded in a "happy ending," and the lost money was "returned to the original owner."

On another occasion, in the final stages of the war, Germans felt a great lack of yellow steel, so they turned their attention to the steel roof of Monte Carlo. Fortunately, the German commander who occupied Monaco had read many novels about Monte Carlo and was unwilling to excessively ruin this art treasure, so they survived another crisis!

Monte Carlo has been profitable for 80 years, with the exception of 1939-1940, when it lost 5.8 million francs. Afterwards, it resumed profitability. After the end of the war, business declined again due to the difficulties of life in various places.

Although there are many difficulties at present, Monte Carlo is still quite confident that the golden age of the past will eventually return. The casino management is already preparing to build a radio station, preparing to broadcast sensational "gambling scriptures" to the world in order to attract tourists to this small country with beautiful mountains and clear waters to spend some time, then the money spent in hotels, restaurants, casinos, and scenic spots can maintain the country's expenses. In addition, the casino is also greatly expanding, and it must be made all-encompassing, with everything that should be available, so that tourists can broaden their horizons. In addition, the pawnshop has resumed overnight business, and a police bell, similar to the entrance of a pharmacy, has been installed on the door to meet the urgent needs of customers.

Indeed, for those who are interested in world travel, it seems necessary to take a trip to Monte Carlo. One thing that is certain is that the local hosts will definitely treat you with sincerity.

### After Chen's Execution

— Shao Fu

Before Chen Gongbo was executed by shooting, he repeatedly requested to "look good."

Once, during the final trial in court, he requested to wear a long gown; once, before going to the execution ground, he requested to be exempt from being bound; once, during the execution, he requested that the police officers be quick. The conclusion was all for the sake of "looking good."

In fact, a bullet entering from the back of the head and exiting from the right cheek cannot look good no matter how hard you try. Chen Gongbo, as clever as he was, probably still didn't want to think about this. Alas, how extreme is the desire to "die with dignity"!

Chen Gongbo has now been executed according to the law. The traditional Chinese moral view is that once a person dies, everything is written off; this is because emotion outweighs reason and law. However, there is a historical exception, which is the story of Wu Zixu flogging the corpse.

Following this tradition, there is naturally a thought of pitying talent and a fondness for the defeated. It is said that when Chen was first tried, someone in the audience applauded greatly; and after the verdict, two gentlemen in Shanghai applied for a retrial for him. Yesterday, this page published "How Zhou Zuoren Should Be Sentenced," which is also an example.

There are too many examples. In the past, if Wang Jingwei had not died, now if Hitler was still alive, even foreign friends would inevitably have this mentality.

This is a danger, which can evolve into destroying the law and disrupting discipline, with no true right or wrong.

### Strolling in the Park in Summer

— Ping Qi

There are thirteen parks in Shanghai

"Sir, what would you like to eat?"

"DDT!"

In a corner of Zhongshan Park, I heard a young tourist tell the waiter in the park tea room. The companions all laughed at this novel answer, and then asked him to bring a few bottles of soda.

The

weather is gradually getting hotter, and the number of tourists in the park has suddenly increased. This is the cheapest place for recreation in Shanghai. You can get a small booklet of tickets for one hundred yuan, with a total of five tickets, which can be used in any of the thirteen parks in Shanghai. From June 1st, the closing time of the park has been extended to 10:00 pm, so after spending twenty yuan, as long as you are interested, you can stroll from early in the morning until late at night. There are tea rooms in the park, Western food and egg fried rice to eat in the Bund Park, and Cantonese dim sum in Fuxing Park in Gujiazhai. Sitting in front of the flowers and eating heartily is not a joy in life.

But—have you had a vaccination?

I

don't know why, but Shanghai people especially like to eat shaved ice, so the tea rooms in various parks often supply a large amount of it. Is it clean and hygienic? I haven't heard of anyone testing it. The soda that the tourist who wanted to eat DDT drank was the "××" brand, and others should test the "××" brand of beverage for our health bureau—the person who tested it was found by the American MP, and they found twenty-two kinds of beverages that "contain unclean and harmful ingredients and are not suitable for human beverages."

The Public Works Bureau has indeed made achievements in repairing these thirteen parks. When we just won, the benches in Fuxing Park were torn down and used as firewood, but now they have been repaired and painted with a layer of green paint, which is quite harmonious with the surrounding lush shade.

But, if you are a female tourist, I will ask again—are you wearing high heels?

Because, the asphalt roads in any park are sparsely covered with small sunken pits, some deep and some shallow, some large and some small. In case you think the scenery on all sides is really too beautiful, or you are not careful, your heel will be embedded in these scattered small trap pits, and there will be a risk of tragedy.

The park, of course, is a paradise for children. A happy mother pushing a delicate and beautiful stroller slowly walking in the park is such a beautiful picture!

But

, if your child is already five or six years old, likes to ask questions and get to the bottom of things, then you should think more about taking him to the park.

Because, inside the park, some things cannot stand your child getting to the bottom of them. For example, in Zhongzheng Park in Hongkou, people often squat on the ground playing Pai Gow, and some gamblers are just big kids in their teens. They gamble and shout, and I have even seen them fight. There are many strange women in the Bund Park. They dress strangely, and the way they walk and look at people is also very strange. At night, they sometimes pull and pull other tourists—if your child asks you, how will you answer him?

However, the sports park in Zhongshan Park (formerly Zhaofeng Park) is worth a visit. Those animals are happy. The zoo is not very large, but these rabbits, monkeys, geese, three bears, and one deer—are all more fortunate than ordinary Shanghai people. There are too few of them, so although they may be a little lonely, they never suffer from housing shortages. Someone may feel dizzy and even nauseous from the smell of the road and the park's pool when walking to the zoo, but this is actually giving us all the best opportunity to use waste. You think, how many gas masks that are completely useless have been left after the war? Everyone wearing gas masks to stroll in the park, isn't that great!

### See You Poor

— Di Ping

The English name of Yiyuan is Canicrome, which means "dog ring", and the pronunciation is equal to "see you poor". In the past, when there were dog races, I don't know how many people could not escape this ring, becoming very poor; now the dance hall and restaurant are expensive, and still maintain the atmosphere of "see you poor".

### The Mermaid Prefers Quiet to Activity

— Feng Yi

Mermaid Yang Xiuqiong, since becoming disillusioned in the realm of love, had once disappeared from public view. A month ago, the Overseas Chinese News was launched, and Yang, due to her connection with the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, was invited to join the newspaper as a reporter. When Mayor Wu's wife came to Shanghai, Yang wrote an "Interview Record," which was published in the newspaper. Her writing was clear and elegant, and praised by her colleagues. However, the only condition for a reporter's life is to have a thick skin and diligent legs, to "show one's face" everywhere, but the Mermaid was not accustomed to this, preferring quiet to activity, which affected her work mood and gradually lost interest. Recently, Yang finally resigned. She was then hired by the Finance Department of the Executive Yuan to serve as a "typist." Thus, the Mermaid's life has taken another turn. Some say that Yang's situation is similar to that of Wang Renmei, a colleague in the Executive Yuan, and they can be said to be in the same boat. Now that they meet in the same room, they must feel "Why did we need to have known each other before?"

After the former president of the Heping Daily, Wan Meizi, resigned, he is now preparing to establish a publishing company, named "Ren Cong Zhong" (meaning "crowd"). I remember that there is a snack bar in Chengdu called "Kou Pin" (meaning "taste"), which would make a wonderfully matched couplet. In addition, I still remember that more than ten years ago, there was a student at the Beiping Women's Normal University named "Shi Lei" (who was involved in a property dispute and had a lawsuit with a monk, which once caused a sensation in the old capital). Compared with the above two names, it is also a rare and excellent couplet.

Since the arrival of the American army in Shanghai, bars and brothels have all been doing good business. Because American soldiers have been on the battlefield for a long time, their lives are dull and monotonous. Once they arrive in the world of pleasure, their revelry is only human nature. However, many reckless ghosts, relying on their complete "equipment," believe that there is no danger. Unexpectedly, indulging excessively has led to many carelessly contracting diseases. When they triumphantly return home and stagger ashore, their families are unaware and believe that a "decorated soldier" has returned, giving them extra comfort. Later, the American military headquarters learned about this and implemented collective treatment and conducted a detailed investigation of the source. According to the reporter's report, among the Shanghai part, a total of 69 people were infected by prostitutes, 111 by bar girls, 310 by dancers (referring to sailor dance halls), and two by girlfriends (?). However, the above figures also include foreign prostitutes, dancers, bar girls, and girlfriends. Afterwards, the American military also sent a letter to the Shanghai Police Bureau, expressing "concern" about this and willing to assist the police bureau in "disinfection," which is another cooperation outside of Sino-American cooperation.

### A Descendant of Qu Yuan

— Sima Huan

Yesterday, while eating zongzi, I wonder if everyone still thought of that great national poet who walked along the riverbank, was upright and talented, and had a backbone and blood?

King Huai of Chu alienated him, and King Qingxiang was even more impolite, relocating him to the riverbank. This scholar, who was knowledgeable, strong-willed, and clear about governance and chaos, and skilled in rhetoric, encountered two periods of repression from father and son. How could he not be worried and thoughtful, throwing himself into the Miluo River with a stone in his arms, and indignantly seeking to remain pure?

If Qu Yuan were to be reborn more than two thousand years later and encounter that Shangguan Dafu who slandered him again and again, he might put on a smiling face, run to the public mansion, make arrangements, be willing to be included in the cadre, get promoted and make a fortune, be successful in all directions, and have nothing to say.

However, every year at the Dragon Boat Festival, how can we eat zongzi and how can we perform the Dragon Boat Race?

"Messiah" is a world-renowned work by the famous oratorio composer Handel. The structure of recitation, solo, and chorus is very symmetrical. The above two pieces are selected from the drama. The first song is a very beautiful soprano piece. The words have been selected as Handel's gazette in the Holy West Temple in England to commemorate this generation of music sage.

"The Maid of Cadiz" was published in 1872, with a Spanish dance flavor. The author, Delibes, focused on operas, comedies, and operettas in his early years. His later works began to focus on ballet.

B

The Italian pianist and composer Arditi (1892-1903) composed many coloratura soprano songs, "Il Bacio" being one of them. This is a waltz that depicts the sweetness of a kiss. It is very humorous and popular. Arditi spent most of his life abroad, traveling to Germany, Austria, Russia, and other countries to perform, and was known as an opera conductor.

The author Wekerlin was musically gifted as a child. His father was a manufacturer. Because he was unwilling to study business, he fled to Paris and entered the Conservatory of Music to specialize in music. He then succeeded as a famous composer. The tunes he composed were all light and exquisite.

4 Homecoming Song

This song depicts the emotions of people returning home after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. It was recently created by the young Chinese writer Zhang Dinghe. Zhang has created many works during the Anti-Japanese War, which have been well received everywhere. It was performed in Chongqing and appreciated by General Marshall.

Among modern Chinese songs rich in poetry, Mr. Zhao Yuanren's works are the most popular. These two are the most loved by the general public. Zhao is currently teaching at an American university.

Madam Guan of Zhao Mengfu was good at writing poems and painting. Zhao wanted to take a concubine and first used a short poem to observe Guan's intention. Guan answered with this poem. Songxue laughed loudly after getting the poem, and the intention to take a concubine stopped. This tune was composed by Professor Ying Shangneng for the bass.

6 A

Hahn Qingnian loved composing music since he was young. From his songs, ballets, and operas, we can understand the essence of his art. This song means that if my poems have wings, they will fly straight to the beautiful garden, and like little birds, I will lovingly surround you all day long.

B

This nocturnal feast song was composed by Gounod. The mood is very beautiful. Gounod is a French composer. His masterpiece can be said to be unprecedented. He became famous before his famous opera "Faust" was completed.

6 A

Cavatine is selected from the opera Semiramide. This two-act song with oriental colors was completed by the author Rossini in just one month. The lyrics were written by the French writer Voltaire. The plot tells a story of a love triangle in ancient times. This song is sung by the heroine of the drama.

B

The author Verdi is from Northern Italy and is from the same era as Wagner. In "La Traviata," he once again showed his outstanding talent in his later years. This song is one of them. His music in this play is suitable for performers to match, but it is extraordinarily exquisite. He does not need to spend a lot of energy, creating nature ingeniously.

### Breaking Glass Solves Food and Lodging

— Wuling Ren

It is said that there was a monk who ate meat all year round. When a pilgrim asked if he was not afraid of sin, the monk said well, "If I don't go to hell, who will?" The abbot of the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road has recently had the temple premises occupied by the district government as an office. Killing chickens and cooking meat in the temple kitchen is suspected of insulting the Buddhist temple. He has submitted a request to the authorities to order them to move. In the eyes of the monk who eats meat all year round, he must think that the problem is not just killing chickens and cooking meat.

The movie theaters in Chongqing, although the buildings and facilities are far inferior to the small movie theaters in Shanghai, have long implemented assigned seating. Shanghai, which is known for taking the lead in everything, has caused a storm over the issue of assigned seating in major movie theaters, causing a mess. People in Sichuan were very surprised to hear this.

In the past, Shanghai had regulations that poor people deliberately broke store windows in the downtown area, waiting to be caught and taken to the government office, but were therefore able to solve three meals in the Western prison. In the future, if the same incident is discovered, I believe that there will be at least two factors. In addition to the bread problem, it should be the housing problem.

According to reports, Lang Yuxiu is scheduled to hold solo concerts at the Lyceum Theater every night on the 5th, 6th, and 7th. The program includes Western famous songs such as Messiah and Flowers of the Alps. Another news item said, "A gathering will be held at a hotel in Paris on June 4, where French film and drama actresses will recite ancient Chinese poems, mostly Li Bai's poems." This is certainly a good example of Sino-Western cultural exchange. What is suspected is that many ancient Chinese poems are so profound that even the Chinese cannot understand them, but foreigners can recite them fluently from the mouths of actresses. Who knows.

According to estimates by the Hong Kong health authorities, there are currently one million rats in Hong Kong, equal to the population. This estimate is not to be believed unless rats also have household registration to check.

— Da

The Shiwan Mountain Survey Team, jointly organized by Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, entered the mountains before the victory and worked for more than seven months, traveling nearly ten thousand miles. Starting from Maju Mountain in the Qin and Fang counties of Guangdong Province in the east and ending at Paiai in the Sile County of Guangxi Province in the west, the survey has been completed. The team's measurement results revealed that the entire area of ​​the Shiwan Mountains reaches more than 2,000 square kilometers. In terms of plants, forty to fifty species of rubber vines have been discovered, including six of the best. There are many medicinal plants, including a species of bitter cassia, which can be an effective drug for dysentery. A considerable number of wood that can be used for aviation manufacturing has also been discovered. In terms of minerals, the most abundant reserves are antimony, silver, and coal. Deposits have also been found, but the mineral age is young and the value is low. All plants, minerals, and other items have been sampled by the team.

### Shu Gan (Feeling Comfortable)

— Guo Lanxin

Deep national hatred is knotted, family disasters leave traces of vicissitudes, firewood and rice are sad to meet, and wars are busy with drastic changes. There is no clean land in the world, and people have passionate hearts. Seek life from death, the sky is dim and the sun and moon are barren.

Business Notice

### Stamp Tax Application Method

Interpretation from the Direct Taxation Bureau

Qi Zhaogang asked: I read the notice from the Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance: All commercial account books or capital books, except for joint-stock companies that have already affixed stamp tax on stocks, must be affixed with a stamp tax of 40 cents per hundred yuan of amount. The reader deeply believes that the general merchants in Shanghai feel troublesome, for two reasons: (1) It is said that the largest face value of the newly issued stamp is four yuan. (2) It is not easy to buy large denominations from banks and post offices that sell them on behalf. Currently, the capital of general merchants in Shanghai is around tens of millions of yuan. Even if the stamp tax is 40 cents per hundred yuan, a large stamp with a face value of 400 yuan, for example, a capital of 10 million yuan, would require purchasing 40,000 yuan worth of stamps, which is as many as 100 sheets. How can it be affixed to the account book? Can the Direct Taxation Bureau issue a tax payment receipt and affix it to the account book for convenience, whether it is legal or not? Please ask your column to answer on behalf of the public. (Reply from the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance)

I have received a letter from your reader, who has questions about the stamp tax application method. The following is an explanation: (1) Stamps with a face value of 1,000 yuan are now available on the market and can be purchased from banks and post offices that sell stamps on behalf. (2) If the amount of each application is more than 10,000 yuan, you can come to the fourth section of this bureau or the offices in each district to apply for a triplicate payment form. After paying to the national treasury, affix the receipt to the account book. I hope you will check and forward the above two points, and publish them in your newspaper for public viewing. Sincerely yours, Social Service Department of Shen Bao.
