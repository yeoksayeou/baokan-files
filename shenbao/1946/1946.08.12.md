### The Hope for Peace Has Not Yet Reached a Desperate Stage: Marshal and Ambassador Stuart Resolve to Continue Efforts; The Core Issues Remain Unresolved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] At 7 PM tonight, Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Wang Bingnan, accepted an invitation to dinner at the U.S. Embassy. Following dinner, they held talks with Ambassador Stuart and Advisor Fu Jingbo. They did not leave the embassy until after 10 PM. The discussions reportedly still revolved around old issues, such as the military reorganization plan, the withdrawal of troops from northern Jiangsu, and local government issues. However, no progress was made. They merely exchanged views on the core issues again. It is said that the Communist Party has no room for further concessions. Ambassador Stuart will visit Marshal tomorrow to convey Zhou Enlai's views from today. Whether or not Marshal goes to Guling will depend on the outcome of discussions on Zhou's views. This shows that both men have not given up on the final efforts for peace.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The Communist Party delegation held an internal meeting today to carefully study the statement issued by Marshal and Ambassador Stuart yesterday. They are awaiting instructions from Yan'an before deciding on a public statement. Zhou Enlai may hold a press conference tomorrow.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at the U.S. Embassy at 9 AM this morning for two hours. It is understood that both men were quite disappointed with the outcome of their mediation efforts for peace. However, both agreed that the door to peace negotiations has not been closed. If both sides can make further concessions on the core issues, namely the issue of local administration after the troop withdrawal, negotiations can still continue. Both men are awaiting the reactions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to their statement issued yesterday to decide on their next course of action. Marshal has denied the rumors circulating last night that he would fly to Xunyang today.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] In the peace talks, the issue of troop withdrawal and local administrative power has led Ambassador Stuart and Marshal to feel disappointed with their efforts to mediate peace because the Communist Party refused to accept the government's views, resulting in the issuance of this joint statement. However, both men believe that if both sides can make further concessions, negotiations may still continue.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 11th] People here are not surprised by the issuance of the joint statement by Marshall and Stuart. The reaction from all parties to the joint statement has been uniformly positive. First, the joint statement clearly demonstrates the hard work, perseverance, and dedicated effort of the two men in pursuing peace with enthusiasm and courage. Second, the extent of progress in continuing peace talks can be better understood from the joint statement. Third, the crux of the current inability to reach an agreement lies in the nature of local governments in the areas from which troops are withdrawn, a problem arising from determining the areas of troop deployment. It is generally believed that replacing unification with division and guaranteeing separatism with autonomy are consistent with the Communist Party's approach. However, unified military and administrative orders are essential basic conditions for a modern national army. The two men will surely find a reasonable solution to transform contradictions into unity.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] It is said that Marshal intends to issue a statement on the Anping Incident in the near future to express his position. It is understood that the statement is currently being carefully studied by Marshal.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Ambassador Stuart has decided to leave Nanjing for Beiping on Wednesday to handle school affairs at Yenching University. He will return to Nanjing in about a week.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] According to Stuart's advisor, Fu Jingbo, Marshal is unlikely to return to the United States soon, and there has been no news of a fourth trip to Lushan.

### Reactions to Marshal and Stuart's Statement Vary; Most Approve and View It as an Ultimatum

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] According to well-informed diplomatic sources tonight, the joint statement issued by Marshal and Ambassador Stuart yesterday should not be seen as a sign of failed mediation, but rather as an ultimatum to both warring parties, urging them to withdraw and seek peace. Most observers said that when they initially read the statement, they all believed that Marshal and Stuart had publicly announced the suspension of negotiations. However, after examining the document more closely, they believe that it is undoubtedly a firm ultimatum.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Political circles here believe that Marshal and Ambassador Stuart's declaration in their joint statement that negotiations have reached an impasse indicates that the United States must re-examine its China policy. The current dangerous situation, where the political struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which has spanned two decades, has re-emerged on the battlefield, seems to be a reliable observation. Some political figures say that the United States has three options: a policy of non-intervention, a policy of "neither advancing nor retreating" (which the United States is currently adopting), and unconditional support for the National Government. These people insist that the United States must align its China policy with its global policy. When meeting with spokespersons for the CCP and asking for their views on the joint statement, they replied that the CCP was still studying it.

A Statement from a Certain Important Person

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] After the release of the joint statement by Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, a relevant person here told reporters, "From now on, negotiations will probably be put on hold temporarily." The spokesperson implied to reporters that some issues that cannot be resolved through negotiations will be resolved in another way. The spokesperson also predicted that Marshal would return to the United States temporarily, but reserved judgment on whether Stuart would continue to serve as ambassador. As for the question of whether the Executive Headquarters would "close down" under these circumstances, the spokesperson said that the Executive Headquarters would still continue to exist. (Cai Wenzhi, but should not disclose his name)

Ye Jianying's Opinion

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] Today, reporters visited Ye Jianying and asked for his opinion on the joint statement by Marshall and Stuart. The questions and answers are as follows: (Q) What are your thoughts on the joint statement? (A) I was very busy this morning, and I have only just begun to study it. (Q) Does this indicate that negotiations are impossible to continue? (A) The negotiations certainly did not yield results, but there is no clear indication that negotiations have broken down. (Q) Do you predict that Marshal will return to the United States? (A) I can't tell. (Q) Do you think Stuart will continue to serve as ambassador? (A) It's hard to say. (Q) Will the Executive Headquarters continue to exist? (A) As long as the Nanjing Three-Man Committee exists, the Executive Headquarters will also exist.

The Executive Headquarters Will Close

[United Press, Beiping, 11th] Since the release of the joint statement yesterday by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation has been tending towards closing down because it cannot fulfill its mission of peace, and this has become increasingly imminent tonight.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 11th] The American branch of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation is awaiting orders from Nanjing today to facilitate closure. Americans who have thoroughly studied the joint declaration by Marshall and Stuart believe that it is impossible to find hope for peace in China within it. In view of this statement, they firmly believe that the Executive Headquarters will be abolished.

### Chairman Chiang is Deliberating and Finalizing an Important "August 14th" Statement for Broadcast Worldwide on the Eve of the Victory Anniversary

[Our Guling Dispatch on the 11th] Chinese and foreign individuals have long awaited Chairman Chiang's statement on the current situation, indicating the government's approach to various issues. After the full text of the joint statement issued by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart in Nanjing arrived in Guling yesterday, people here are paying even closer attention to the policies adopted by the National Government. It is understood that Chairman Chiang's August 14th statement is being finalized. It is said that the statement will reiterate the government's policy of peaceful resolution. Reporters believe that this important statement will certainly have a clarifying effect on the current difficulties and the speculations and rumors they have caused, and will also reveal the government's sincerity in helping Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart succeed in their mission.

[Our Guling Dispatch on the 11th] The international English draft of Chairman Chiang's important August 14th statement will be sent to Nanjing by special envoy on the afternoon of the 12th, while the Chinese draft for domestic publication will be sent to Nanjing on the morning of the 13th after further revision.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 11th] Chairman Chiang's important statement, which will be released on the anniversary of Japan's surrender, will be delivered to the Central News Agency here on the eve of the anniversary for broadcast to Nanjing, and then broadcast to the world by the Nanjing headquarters. The Chairman is currently in the tranquil environment of No. 12 Hedong Road here, making final deliberations and revisions to the contents of his important statement.

[Our Guling Dispatch on the 11th] At 9 AM on the 11th, Chairman Chiang summoned Wu Dingchang, the Secretary-General of the National Government, and spoke until 9:40 AM. Wu then left. At noon, the Chairman hosted a banquet for Chen Jinghan, Wu Dingchang, Chen Bulei, Lai Lian, Li Shuming, Cai Mengjian, and Chiang Ching-kuo. At 5 PM, the Chairman also summoned Dr. Yao Le.

### Zeng Qi Goes to Guling at Chairman Chiang's Invitation; Visited Ambassador Stuart Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, will fly to Xunyang and then Guling at 9 AM on the 12th, accompanied by Ke Dong, a member of the Standing Committee of the party, at the invitation of Chairman Chiang.

[Another Dispatch] After Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued a statement on the 10th regarding the mediation of peace in China, Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, a member of the Standing Committee of the party, visited Ambassador Stuart again at his residence at 9:30 AM on the 11th. Zeng said: The problems in China are indeed extremely complex and difficult, but encountering intertwined roots and knots makes the weapon visible. If approached with an indomitable spirit, it will not be difficult to achieve the final goal. However, haste makes waste, and one must not be too impatient and must be patient and resolute. He hopes that Ambassador Stuart will not be discouraged by the difficulties. The ambassador expressed his willingness to work towards China's peaceful unification, democratic strength, and prosperity, and to see it through to the end without giving up halfway. Zeng was very satisfied and stated that the Youth Party is willing to do its utmost to help.

### Two Weeks After the Anping Incident, the Investigation Work Is Still Obstructed, and American Officials and Civilians Are Becoming Impatient and May Proceed Independently

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] Two weeks have passed since the Anping Incident, but the Executive Headquarters 25th Group, which was ordered to investigate the Anping Incident, has been beset with obstacles and has been unable to begin its investigation work as of today. It is generally believed that if the work of the group is further hindered, the American side may proceed with the investigation work independently in order to quickly complete its report, because American officials and civilians are becoming impatient to understand the truth of the Anping Incident. The 25th Group held another meeting at 9 AM on the 11th, which lasted 40 minutes, but no results were achieved. According to Chairman Davis, the instructions from the three members of the Executive Headquarters regarding the work of the group had not been received as of the meeting. He then tentatively suggested listening to the Marine Corps report, but Communist Party representative Huang Yifeng still objected. Davis then announced that they would await instructions from the three members and hold another meeting on the morning of the 12th. According to Ye Jianying, he has received instructions from Zhou Enlai stating that Marshal has agreed that the group investigating the Anping Incident will be chaired by the three parties in rotation, and that the investigation procedure will be discussed before the investigation begins. However, as of today, the official order from the Nanjing Three-Man Meeting regarding this matter has not been received.

### The Situation in Datong Relaxes; All Stations on the Zhengtai Railway Are Fully Recovered

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] The situation in Datong eased slightly today. General Ma Zhanshan's office in Beiping did not send any more urgent telegrams. However, the Communist Party representative of the Datong Group of the Executive Headquarters left Datong yesterday and went to the Communist area. Officials suspect that the Communist Party representative's departure was a planned action. The government representative, Lieutenant Colonel Li Xin, and the American representative, Colonel McTeer, are still in Datong, but they cannot work. The Pingfawang Power Plant and the Kouquan Coal Mine, which were occupied by the Communist Party, have not been destroyed, and they are planning to use the power from Pingwang to resume mining operations at the Kouquan Coal Mine.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 11th] The stations on the Zhengtai Railway, which were attacked by the Communist army, have been completely recovered by the National Army. The Communist army has withdrawn from the railway, and the Railway Bureau has sent workers to repair all the damaged areas. If there are no special obstacles, repairs can be completed by the 15th.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 10th] Baoding Telephone: According to military sources, traffic east of Yangquan and west of Zhengshui on the Zhengtai Railway has been completely cut off. On the 8th, the Communist army failed to destroy the Zhengshui Bridge and retreated. Its Jinbei Field Army is concentrated in the Jingxing and Niangziguan areas, and is well-equipped. Fighting continues in the Baiyangbao area. The Communist army along the Zhengtai Railway is advancing towards Taiyuan. The sound of cannons can be heard all day long in the area west of Shijiazhuang. There are no incidents around Baoding, but the city defense authorities have been stepping up precautions in recent days. The construction of city trenches is nearing completion, and bunkers in the suburbs are also being built rapidly.

### U.S. Forces in North China Announce the Resumption of Security Exercises; Reserve Troops Stationed Here to Return Home in Batches

[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 11th] The U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters in North China announced the resumption of security exercises, which had been suspended for a year. During the exercises, all officers and soldiers assume that they are under enemy attack and engage in defense in an emergency state. Even giant tanks are mobilized. These exercises will now be held every Saturday. People who are concerned are pondering the implications of this move by the U.S. military.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 11th] Two U.S. transport ships, the USS Alnitah and the USS Rancher, arrived in Qingdao on the 10th, carrying regular troops from the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. It is understood that these are troop rotations. The number of personnel is unknown. It is understood that the reserve troops of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao have begun to return home in batches.

### The Breach of the Dike Is Clearly a Planned Act of Sabotage; The Communist Army Uses Water as a Barrier; Who Are They Deceiving with So-Called Natural Causes?

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Regarding the Communist army's breach of the dike in northern Jiangsu, the Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency in Huaiyin claimed on the 10th: "A small part is due to natural causes, and the majority is caused by the Kuomintang's policy of civil war," placing all the blame for the disaster in northern Jiangsu on the Kuomintang. However, based on the terrain of the disaster area, we can gain the following understanding: (1) The flooded area south of Suqian City extends the Hongze Lake and connects the Yaowan flooded area. If Huaiyin is the center, this flooded area will form an arc shape, which can prevent the National Army from advancing beyond the arc and can protect the heart of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, Huaiyin City. (2) The flooded area west of the canal around the Canal Station is designed to block the National Army's attack from Xuzhou. Longchiji has now fallen, and the reason why Suqian has been spared is that the Communist army has troops in Suqian. (3) The Donghai flooded area is only a few miles from Donghai City, but because Donghai City is located at a higher elevation, it has not been affected. However, its northern side is connected to the Yellow Sea, and the western side is connected to the Guanyun flooded area, isolating Donghai. Judging from the overall situation, the majority of the flooded area is not within the Communist army's area, which is clearly a planned act of sabotage, using the water as a barrier. Its impact has already made a very obvious impression on us.

### The Situation at Huangkou Station Is Unclear; The Communist Army Fiercely Attacks West of Xuzhou

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th] The Communist army, which has been gathering in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan, suddenly attacked Huangkou Station, about 50 kilometers west of Xuzhou on the Longhai Railway, with three to four thousand men on the night of the 10th. A fierce battle broke out with the security forces stationed there. After the telegraph lines between Huangkou and Xuzhou were cut, the situation is unclear.

### Unless the CCP Army Implements Unified Organization, the U.S. Will Never Consider Equipping Them - Mr. Acheson's Response to Questions on China Policy

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] According to Under Secretary of State Acheson: the United States has absolutely not considered providing the Communist army with American-style training or even the most minimal equipment needs, unless the Communist army soon shows hope of unifying with the National Army and becoming a unified national army. His statement was made in a letter dated July 31st to Mr. Colber, Executive Committee Member of the newly established American China Policy Association. The letter was in response to the American China Policy Association's questions to the State Department on July 24th regarding U.S. China policy, especially the rumor that the Communist army would be supplied with American-trained equipment even before it merged with the National Army. The letter cited a statement by the President on December 15, 1945, considering that statement as the basis of U.S. China policy. The U.S. government has always opposed resolving political problems by force, and General Marshall is currently doing his utmost to enable the two major political groups in China to cooperate peacefully and form a joint government with representatives from all parties to fulfill the U.S. government's hope. This is well known. Military forces should be merged, and political aspects must also be merged. The agreement on the reorganization and unification of the army, signed in Chongqing on February 25, 1946, is the basis for the reorganization and unification of the armies of both the Nationalists and the Communists. For armies with different standards of equipment and training, any unification must be given an equal amount of time so that the chaos during unification can be minimized. However, unless the Communist army soon shows hope of unifying with the National Army and becoming a unified army of the Republic of China, the United States has no intention of providing the Communist army with American-style training or even the most minimal equipment needs. The armies under the direct rule of the National Government, according to the wartime thirty-nine division plan proposed by General Stilwell, are equivalent to thirteen corps, each with three divisions, each of which has American military equipment, and twenty divisions have been fully trained by the United States. The American China Policy Association was recently established, with Powell as Chairman and Mrs. Fairbank as Vice Chairman. The founders also include Green of the American Federation of Labor, Hopkins, President of Dartmouth College, Gideon, President of the Brookings Institution, and Cowles, publisher of newspapers and magazines.

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] Colber, a member of the Executive Committee of the American China Policy Association, announced on the 9th the letter he sent to Acting Secretary of State Acheson on July 31 regarding U.S. China policy. In the letter, Mr. Colber raised eight points, requesting answers to "better understand all aspects of your department's China policy" by the Committee of the China Policy Association. According to Mr. Colber's statement, the following questions were raised in the association's first letter to the State Department on July 24 and were not answered: (1) Does our aid depend solely on the Chinese government fulfilling the demands of the Communist Party, regardless of whether their demands are reasonable? (2) If the Chinese government is willing to abide by the agreements brokered by Marshall on January 31 and April 25 of this year, and the Communist Party still insists that the government make repeated concessions, will the U.S. military withdraw due to China's lack of unity? (3) Is Marshall ordered to force the Chinese government to accept further demands from the Communist Party? (4) In the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945, the Soviet Union promised to assist the Chinese National Government without any conditions, so why should U.S. aid to China depend on whether China reaches an agreement with the Communist Party? (5) Has the official received news that the Communist Party has violated the terms of the political agreement brokered by Marshall on April 10? If so, will you prepare to announce this notice or statement? (6) Regarding the consultations made by Hurley in 1944 and 1945, the committee made a statement. Is the essence of this statement correct? Is it not the time to publish Hurley's report? (7) Would forcing the Chinese government to organize a coalition government with the Communist Party not lead to China becoming a vassal state of the Soviet Union, like Poland and Yugoslavia? (8) Is the Open Door and the territorial integrity of China still our basic policy? In its letter to the State Department on July 24, the American Policy Association asked whether the U.S. government had changed its Open Door policy to a sham policy.

The U.S. government stated that "the deaths of four U.S. Marines in China is not the main issue," and that "the Chinese Communist Party's resistance to opening up transportation lines through Communist areas by U.S. Marines is quite justified." The letter stated: In terms of the latter point, it was agreed to by both the Chinese Communists and Marshal Marshall in the January 10 agreement.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Regarding the joint statement by Marshall and Ambassador Stuart stating that it was impossible to mediate the Chinese war, the State Department stated that this news has not been confirmed. A spokesman said: No official criticism will be made until the State Department has confirmed this statement. Congressional reactions to the statement were mixed, with some saying "U.S. troops should withdraw from China as soon as possible"; others suggested that the U.S. should take "stronger action" to "clarify the overall situation in China."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] This afternoon, the local newspapers suddenly published a joint statement by Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, which was tantamount to admitting the failure of their peace mission in China, but the newspapers did not immediately comment on it.

### Communist Troops Lurking in the Wuxi Area, Attempting to Sabotage the Nanjing-Shanghai Line - Mao Zedong Orders Cadres to Create Riots

[Central News Agency, Yangzhou, 11th] The CCP is attempting to sabotage the Nanjing-Shanghai railway. More than 600 armed sabotage team members have been scattered in Wuxi, Shitangtan, Yixing, and other places, waiting for opportunities to act. Xue Bin, the CCP Sunan Action Army, is currently strengthening sabotage work in the Maoshan area and has also formed assassination squads. These squads are divided into four groups, each with six or seven members, all equipped with short guns, lurking in Danyang, Jin and other places, secretly operating.

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th] It is learned here that Mao Zedong recently instructed CCP cadres that the so-called "important tasks at present" include two items: (1) CCP personnel lurking in Nationalist Party areas, if their work has a considerable foundation, should create incidents under absolutely favorable conditions and take the opportunity to riot, but this riot must be covered up to avoid exposure. (2) Actively expand the number of self-defense militia to strive for the goal of reaching four million troops, and strictly strengthen the militia's combat training.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] Communist troops in Dongtai and Xinghua have recently forcibly conscripted 20 able-bodied men, 15 women, and 12 children from each village in various townships, causing public resistance. At the end of July, the people successively destroyed five Communist district offices in Caoren, Xiaohai, Shenzao, Baiju, and Bazao, and beat and injured the head, instructor, and district head of the Communist district of Baiju.

### First Anniversary of the Victory of the War of Resistance - Christians in Nanjing Hold a Celebration Service - U.S. Ambassador Speaks in Chinese on World Vision

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Nanjing Christian Association held a celebration service for the anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance at Hanzhong Church at 4 p.m. on the 11th. U.S. Ambassador Dr. Stuart delivered a sermon, with more than a thousand people attending. The ambassador wore a simple white summer suit and spoke in fluent Chinese. He first stated that during his three years and eight months of detention by the Japanese in Ping, he deeply felt the preciousness of freedom. To save mankind from suffering, the key is to avoid war and killing, and to gradually form a world state (World State) among all countries in the world. The ambassador believes that the anniversary of the victory has arrived, but the contradictions and conflicts among the Allied countries still inevitably exist. He often thinks that the Allied countries should gradually form a world state. Before this dream is realized, the people of all countries must first have a global perspective. The ambassador said: "The world state cannot be achieved by the rulers and leaders of a few countries alone. Its formation lies in the people of each country automatically developing a global perspective. Furthermore, it is the realization of the Datong ideal, that is, the practice of Confucius's ideal of 'all within the four seas are brothers.'" The ambassador continued: Democracy is the best of the current political systems, but if the people lack a sense of responsibility, it can also evolve into the worst political system. China is moving towards democracy, and all Christians and Chinese youth should work hard for its realization.

### The Capital High Court Tries the Traitor Wang Yintai

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Capital High Court reopened the trial of Wang Yintai, the former chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, on the 10th. Judge Ge Zhaotang served as the presiding judge, and the defendant's lawyer, Dai Xiuzan, accompanied Wang to court. He continued to submit three kinds of documents favorable to the traitor. The traitor had submitted a total of 43 rebuttals. The court first inquired about the six incidents of forcibly occupying ancient porcelain. Wang Yintai categorically denied them. The defense attorney requested the court to consider that the traitor defended Tianjin and Beijing until the enemy surrendered, stabilized the overall situation in North China to await the Central Government's takeover, and that he had made contributions to the country. However, after repeated questioning by the court regarding his participation in the puppet organization, the defendant finally admitted his mistake. The court adjourned at 12:30 p.m. The court continued at 2:50 p.m. Wang Yintai continued to submit several documents favorable to the people. The court then read a letter from a reader named Jin Shi in Beiping, which described in detail Wang Yintai's employment of personnel, administration, and private life during his tenure in the enemy puppet regime. Those who attended the hearing laughed at this, but Wang Yintai repeatedly quibbled until 5:45 p.m., when the court ordered him to collect documents and scheduled another trial for September 3.

### To Develop Transportation in Northwestern Hubei, the Provincial Government Plans a Five-Year Highway Plan

[This newspaper, Xikou, 11th] In order to develop transportation in western and northern Hubei, the Hubei Provincial Government has drafted a five-year highway construction plan to build five highways: Yuan-Yi (Yuan Kuipo to Yichang), En-Li (Enshi to Lichuan), Lao-Ba (Laohekou to Badong), Nan-Zhu (Nantan to Zhushan), and Yi-Xuan (Yichang to Xuanen).

It is proposed to ask the Central Government to bear half of the cost.

### Chinese and Foreign Water Conservancy Experts Arrive in Hangzhou - Inspect the Qiantang River Railway Bridge - And Inspect the Seawall Repair Project

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] A Qiantang River Seawall Inspection Team composed of twelve Chinese and foreign water conservancy engineering experts arrived in Hangzhou yesterday. In the afternoon, the newly appointed Director of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, Mao Yisheng, led the inspection of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge. The cement road on the upper level of the bridge had five holes blown up during the War of Resistance. The authorities urgently planned to repair it and stabilize the bridge foundation. This project will take one year and cost 110,000 yuan. It is currently awaiting allocation of funds from the Central Government. Once the funds arrive, the repair work can begin. At 8 a.m. this morning, the team, together with Chairman Shen, Construction Department Chief Pi Zuohuan, and Mao Yisheng, went to Haining Baobao to inspect the seawall repair project. There are a total of seven breaches in the Haining stone seawall, totaling more than 1,740 meters in length. Six breaches have been blocked, leaving only Zhao Wei breach. The method is to build a firewood seawall near the river, build an earthen seawall in the middle, and finally build an earthen storage seawall. The entire project requires 77,000 bundles of firewood, 100,000 workers, and 116,000 cubic meters of earth. The seawall engineering work in Haining accounts for 70% of the total, while that in Haiyan accounts for 30%. The team will go to Haiyan Zhapu tomorrow for inspection and return to Shanghai the day after tomorrow via Jiaxing. The repair project is nearing completion. The Seawall Engineering Bureau was established yesterday. After this inspection, a specific plan for the seawall can be determined.

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Wang Xiaolai told reporters that this was his first time in the Northeast and he felt the momentum was enormous.

He and others plan to go to Sipingjie, Changchun, and Jilin on the 16th for sightseeing, and then fly back to Shanghai. After returning to Shanghai, he plans to urge the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles to organize an industrial and commercial inspection team to come to the Northeast to facilitate investment in the Northeast by people from the Southeast to restore or expand industry and commerce in the Northeast. Because many people in Shanghai are speculating in U.S. dollar speculation, speculative business is ultimately not as reliable as engaging in meaningful industry. Also, in his opinion, after the capital or manpower from the Southeast comes to the Northeast, it should start with small-scale industry and commerce, so that it can achieve greater results and succeed quickly, and then engage in the construction of large-scale industry and commerce. The future is really bright and great. Finally, talking about the relief problem, Wang said: In addition to general relief, he is also very concerned about the Mongolians and will discuss it with the Northeast Relief Association. The industrial and commercial circles and people in Shanghai will never lag behind in helping those in need.

Editorial

### The Situation After the Marshall-Stuart Joint Statement

Humbly Offering Our Recommendations to the Government and the People

We are deeply grateful to the two friendly mediating envoys, Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, for issuing a joint statement in the capital on the afternoon of the 10th. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the main points of this statement are threefold: (1) They have consistently been studying various possible methods to end the current conflict and are starting to reorganize the government; (2) Peace is the unanimous desire of the entire Chinese people. To avoid economic collapse, a solution to the political situation must be devised, and both the government and the Communist leaders also desire a ceasefire, but the scope of the war is expanding daily; (3) Among the issues that must be resolved immediately but have been difficult to reach an agreement on, are 1) the redeployment of troops, and 2) the nature of local governments in the areas from which troops are withdrawn.

When we read this dispatch the night before last, we were shocked and overwhelmed with thoughts, but we could only express a few mixed feelings of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness. (1) The two envoys, Marshall and Stuart, are old and carry great responsibility, working tirelessly for peace in China. Although they have not yet been able to celebrate success, after peeling away the layers, only two seemingly difficult-to-agree issues remain. If they can make further progress, "sincerely investigate things," there is still light ahead. This seems sweet. (2) A year of victory, a golden age has been wasted. The Chinese cannot resolve Chinese affairs themselves, troubling allies to such an extent, and they are still unwilling to compromise for the sake of the country. When we think of our compatriots in SuBei, Anhui, and the border areas of Hubei and Henan, in the suburbs of Datong, suffering in deep water and scorching fire, how can we not feel sourness? (3) The Chinese people have suffered enough! Enduring eight years of war was not enough; they must also endure the suffering of internal strife spreading. Allies are so reluctant to come to rescue us from suffering, yet the warmongers who create internal strife, after a year of contention, insist on adding more suffering to the people. Seeing that peace is temporarily hopeless, when will the taste of bitterness end! (4) During the war, China was originally one of the "Four Powers," but later became one of the "Five Powers," with China relegated to the bottom of the Five Powers. The Moscow Conference concentrated power in the "Three Powers," and although the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference changed the Three Powers to the "Four Powers," China was no longer among the "Four Powers," replaced by France, which had once been occupied. Every time internal strife in China expands, its international status declines; every time internal strife in China deepens, its international status weakens. We read the newspaper every day, always feeling a spiciness that makes us unable to close our mouths. We believe that the statement by Marshall and Stuart will surely increase these mixed feelings of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness in general.

However, whether it is sweetness, sourness, bitterness, or spiciness, as Chinese people living in today's China, we must strive to resolve the issues of today's China. Some people believe that the Marshall-Stuart statement shows the failure of mediation efforts, even calling it a tragedy; it is also rumored that Marshal Marshall is preparing to return to the United States next month, seeming to further imply that the situation is difficult to salvage. Our view is not entirely so. First, the Marshall-Stuart statement does not explicitly state that they have failed and have no intention of further mediation.

Second, Reuters reports that general observations still believe that Marshal Marshall has not hinted at leaving China, and Beijing has not indicated that the situation is hopeless. Third, as pointed out in the statement, the government and the Communist leaders actually desire peace. Fourth, the trend of domestic economic collapse is forcing everyone to seek a peaceful solution. Fifth, Zhou Enlai has stated that "the seriousness of the situation is actually greater than what is said in the statement," and Wang Bingnan has stated that "the core of the problem lies in peace or war," but the CCP has not yet dared to publicly say that there will only be "war" in the future. At the same time, Chairman Chiang has stated that as long as the four main issues of ceasefire, troop reorganization, restoration of transportation, and the locations where the Communist troops will be stationed are effectively resolved, other issues can be easily resolved, showing that the door to peace is not completely closed. Sixth, and most importantly, the Chinese people, who have experienced the pain firsthand, have not yet made their greatest efforts for peace. If the people can truly propose concrete methods for achieving peace, who would dare to stubbornly refuse to comply? Therefore, we dare to say: The situation after the Marshall-Stuart joint statement is serious, but not necessarily hopeless, and there is no need to be extremely pessimistic. From now on, everything depends on what the people do.

To break this deadlock today, we must find a reasonable solution to the two points that Marshall and Stuart consider difficult. However, before proposing concrete methods, we must first establish three preconditions: (A) The government, the CCP, and the mediators (whether allies or Chinese people who call themselves third parties) must only use reason and not be emotional. Everyone must think about the people's livelihood and not consider the interests of parties. (B) Everyone must show sincerity and not intend to delay further, but especially needs great patience. Mencius said, "Those who do something are like digging a well; digging a well without reaching the spring is like abandoning the well." Today, the work of seeking peace for China is a thousand times more difficult than digging a well. We earnestly hope that the parties involved and the mediators must take "abandoning the well" as a warning. We still need them to show greater patience and perseverance to do the work of deliberation and refinement. (C) Everyone must jointly recognize that China is the China of the Chinese people, not a China divided by the KMT and the CCP or monopolized by one party. Therefore, how the Chinese situation should be resolved in the end can only be determined by the Chinese people. It would be good if the government and the CCP could negotiate well, but otherwise, if they each hold their own opinions and cannot reach an agreement, then the people must step forward and make the final decision. Therefore, at this stage of the Marshall-Stuart mediation, the Chinese people should quickly stand up to support them and cooperate with them to make a public judgment on this matter, and no one is allowed to violate it. It is said that Chairman Chiang will convene a national university president conference at the end of this month. We believe that it may be expanded, how can we have people represent the national opinion to express their national opinion for solving the national crisis. Now, the disease is indeed in the bone marrow, but if we can truly prescribe the right medicine, we may be able to bring the dead back to life.

With the preconditions established, we humbly propose the following suggestions for the survival and glory of the nation:

(1) The government and the CCP should first reiterate their promises to the whole country in the next few days: (1) Stop all propaganda warfare, (2) Absolutely return the government to the people (political democratization) and return the military to the country (nationalization of the army), (3) Be willing to follow the military reorganization and integration plan and effectively restore transportation. This is to establish a "sincere" foundation for future negotiations.

(2) The government should announce its troop redeployment plan, designate the area where the Communist troops will be relocated, and report the extent of the implementation of the troop reorganization that has been carried out in the past; at the same time, the Communist Party can also provide its redeployment plan, the area it is willing to relocate to, and report the extent of its past reorganization. This is to provide the people with information that can be used for public judgment.

(3) After the above two items are completed, the government should, in accordance with the example of the recent 20-day ceasefire in the Central Plains area, immediately issue an order for a general ceasefire throughout the country for 20 days or one month. At the same time, the Military Mediation Department should instruct all groups to immediately go to the conflict areas to supervise and enforce this ceasefire order.

(4) At the same time, the government should convene a more representative national conference or talks in the capital or Lushan, and invite Marshall Marshall and the original mediators and the three members of the Military Mediation Department to participate in the conference or talks as observers. The participants should include (1) the Standing Committee members of the Kuomintang Central Committee, (2) the Standing Committee members of the Communist Party Central Committee, (3) the Standing Committee members of the Youth Party, (3) the Standing Committee members of the State Socialist Party (whether it has been renamed is another question), (5) the Standing Committee members of the Democratic League, (6) the Speakers of the National Political Council, (8) the presidents of universities, (9) the Standing Committee members of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Preparatory Committee, (10) the Standing Directors of the National Industrial Association, (11) the presidents or chief editors of major national newspapers (including Liberation Daily and Xinhua Daily) and news agencies (including Xinhua News Agency), (12) the Standing Directors who can represent national agricultural and industrial groups, and other leaders who can represent religious and social groups. News reporters can be allowed to attend this meeting as observers. The government and the CCP should sincerely state their concrete methods and reasons for resolving the situation, and openly discuss the military reorganization and integration plan, and the reasons why it has not been effectively implemented, and listen to everyone's calm and rational discussion before making a fair and reasonable decision. Not only should the method of permanently stopping the conflict be determined, but also how to effectively reduce the army, how to reorganize the government to expand its democratic foundation, how to convene the National Assembly on schedule, and how to discuss the main points of the constitution can be decided in this conference or talks with national significance. This is truly the supreme method for the Chinese to meet each other with sincerity and for all time.

(5) If the Lushan Conference in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China is considered a conference that decided on the War of Resistance, then the Lushan Conference mentioned above can be said to be a conference that decides on nation-building. Its relationship to China's future is too important. If the Communist Party truly loves the country, it should participate in this conference. As long as the Communist Party can sincerely participate, and the government and the CCP are willing to listen to the opinions of the people and follow the public judgment of the people, not only is there an absolute guarantee of peace in China, but China can also make a leap forward miracle on the road to nation-building. To this day, we believe that the greatest regret is that in the process of negotiations between the government and the CCP over the past year, they have always relied on a few parties and ignored or even forgotten the broad masses of the people! They do not know that today, without the power of the people, it may not be possible to resolve the Chinese situation. If any party refuses to participate in this conference or talks, or does not comply with the decision of this conference or talks, it is tantamount to cutting itself off from the Chinese people. The people must judge right and wrong to help the party that complies with the people's decision to achieve China's democratic unity, and no force should be allowed to obstruct and undermine it.

Readers should not doubt the slow and difficult nature of our proposal; if everyone is sincere and practical, the overall situation in China can be resolved within two months, and the clouds can be cleared to see the blue sky. We think that Marshall and Stuart are currently suffering from being at a loss, so how can the Chinese people still stand by and watch, only sighing under the bean vines and melon racks, or only saying some seemingly neutral cool words? To be honest, the reason why the Chinese situation has been so bad over the past year is that the deep-seated prejudices of the Kuomintang and the CCP are one reason, and some so-called "village good men" who call themselves "neutralists" must also bear part of the responsibility. These "neutralists" do not understand the principle of "being in the middle," and especially do not know the wonderful use of "weighing the pros and cons, weighing the urgency, and weighing the right and wrong," truly committing the fault that Mencius said, "Holding the middle without weighing is like holding one; what is hated about holding one is that it harms the way." Thus, they only know "I am neutral," "I want to be impartial," and they do not ask about right and wrong at all. They think that this way they will not be involved in the whirlpool of right and wrong, and that this way they can please both sides with the word "neutrality." They have no opinions of their own. What is this if not "village good men"? Confucius said, "If someone passes our door without entering our room, I would not regret it, except for the village good men! Village good men are the thieves of virtue!" Mencius further explained that they are "disliked, but there is nothing to criticize; attacked, but there is nothing to attack; they conform to the customs of the world, and they are in harmony with the corrupt world; they live as if they are loyal and trustworthy, and they act as if they are honest and clean; everyone is pleased with them, and they think they are right, but they cannot enter the way of Yao and Shun." Today, we Chinese people must stand up as masters of the country who judge right and wrong, and we must not be village good men-style neutralists who please both sides and are "pleasing to all." Only when the Chinese people change this fundamental attitude will the Chinese situation have a day of rapid and sudden improvement!

### The Palestine Question; Britain Plans to Clarify its Policy in a Declaration; The US Proposes a Compromise Plan; Soviet Newspapers Write Articles Criticizing London; Arab Countries Held a Conference in Egypt Yesterday

[Reuters Dispatch from Washington, 10th] Reliable sources say that the State Department has now drafted a compromise plan to resolve the Palestine issue, in order to eliminate the differences between Britain and the United States on the partition plan for Palestine. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Bernas, who are now in Paris, will discuss this plan this weekend. It is expected that President Truman and the British government can reach a final agreement on the revised plan. It is reported that this compromise plan has been approved by Acting Secretary of State Acheson and submitted to President Truman for consideration. The content is still based on the principle of the partition plan, but it proposes several important revisions.

[Associated Press Dispatch from London, 10th] Britain is awaiting President Truman's decision on the Palestine federal plan. Today, an informal order was issued to the fleet to prepare to intercept, search, and capture any ships carrying Jewish people illegally to the Holy Land. Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, has drafted the main points of Britain's policy on Palestine as follows: (1) Take measures in various parts of Europe to prevent Jewish people from illegally immigrating to Palestine. (2) Block the Mediterranean Sea, intercept, search, and capture illegal immigrant ships. (3) Establish shelters on the British island of Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean to temporarily accommodate illegal immigrants. (4) Ask countries with sparse populations in the world to absorb European refugees as much as possible in order to relieve the burden on Palestine. According to the Palestine news, the British army has prepared to enter the third stage of action. The first stage is said to be "preparing the state" to deal with any possible terrorism by the people, and the second stage is only "defensive" in nature to protect lives. The third stage will take "offensive" actions. British government officials said: The British army in Palestine is ready to deal with the "major developments" in the Holy Land.

[Reuters Dispatch from Alexandria, 10th] The foreign ministers of the Arab countries will arrive here on the weekend to hold a meeting to discuss the Palestine issue in order to determine the attitude of the Arab people towards the statements made by Britain and the United States on this issue. This meeting was convened by the Arab League at the request of Egypt.

[Associated Press Dispatch from Paris, 10th] A telegram from Cairo said that the Imam of Jerusalem, Huseini, told Pei Huseini and other Muslim leaders in Palestine that he had been placed under house arrest by Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky, and Sidky had banned him from expressing his opinions. The failure of Sidky and the Imam is due to the differences in their views on the Palestine issue.

[Associated Press Dispatch from Moscow, 10th] Today's "News" newspaper discussed Britain's Palestine policy, saying: The plan to divide Palestine into four districts is Britain's attempt to evade its responsibility for Jewish immigration. This policy is just adding fuel to the fire. According to the plan, the highest power is still in the hands of the British authorities, but only part of the power is transferred to the local authorities. In other words, it still maintains its control over Palestine's political, economic, and military strategy.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The French government announced today that it cannot agree with the U.S. proposal for a partial merger of the German occupation zone economy. General Pierre Koenig, commander of the French occupation forces, also submitted a compromise plan to the Control Council in Berlin. It proposes that a committee composed of representatives from the relevant countries be organized to coordinate all transportation, communications, banking, industry, agriculture, foreign trade, and pricing matters in the four occupation zones. This committee should operate under the Control Council. Germans may be included in the committee, but their authority should be limited to that of consultants or executors of orders.

[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] Today, during the Allied Control Council meeting, France responded to the U.S. plan to merge the German occupation zones by proposing several counter-suggestions, one of which advocates that the Allied Central Economic Bureau should not apply to the Saar region.

### British Troops Entering Iran Complies with the Charter

[United Press, New York, 10th] British sources here stated today that if British troops were to enter Iran to protect British citizens and property, this action would be in full compliance with the United Nations Charter.

### UNRRA Meeting: Soviet and Czech Representatives Oppose Termination Plan; Discussions on Transferring to the United Nations Continue Today; U.S. Contribution Accounts for 70% of UNRRA Funding

[United Press, Geneva, 10th] The UNRRA Policy Committee discussed the transfer of UNRRA relief operations to United Nations agencies today, but no agreement was reached and the meeting adjourned. Discussions are scheduled to continue on the 12th.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] The U.S. proposal at the UNRRA General Assembly in Geneva to end UNRRA operations has left countries within the Soviet sphere of influence feeling abandoned. Since the end of the war, UNRRA has shipped 2,367,542 tons of food and 208,213 tons of clothing to Albania, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia. With the exception of Albania and Hungary, all of these countries participated in the Paris Peace Conference, and all have voted in unison with the Soviet Union to oppose the termination plan of UNRRA's largest donors, the U.S. and the UK. The U.S. contribution of 2.7 billion USD accounts for 70% of UNRRA funding. Half of UNRRA's relief supplies are provided to countries within the Soviet sphere of influence, with only 14 countries receiving UNRRA assistance in total.

### Ernest Bevin: The British Giant Attending the Peace Conference, Is Clement Attlee's Great Assistant, And Is Vyacheslav Molotov's Nemesis

In physique and will, Bevin is a giant. He will not bow his head before any strong wind, nor will he be swayed by any force. If someone thinks that he regards the Soviet Union as an equal opponent without any respect and defends certain British foreign policies, it indicates that he has been influenced by right-wing forces. Such a person can be said to completely misunderstand his character and the entire background of British politics. Certainly, at every diplomatic conference, he is almost always Molotov's arch-enemy, because both of them are outspoken and uncompromising. Bevin's voice is thunderous, and his eloquence is unrestrained, often leaving even the most articulate Molotov at a loss for words. However, this does not indicate that he is a right-leaning thinker. The fact that the British people chose the Labour Party in the election shows that their left-leaning attitude has not changed in the slightest.

Undoubtedly, Bevin's foreign policy is his own, and it stems from his unwavering left-wing perspective. This may be difficult for some to understand, not only foreigners but also British people. But as long as we understand the background of the development of the British left wing, it will seem very natural.

This background can be divided into two parts. On the one hand, there is the working-class labor movement, originating from various industrial unions. Two equally important leading figures in this movement are Bevin and Morrison. This group believes in the slogan of the French Revolution, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," which is also known as the "pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness" in the American Declaration of Independence. They hope that everyone can speak freely, that their talents and strengths should be respected regardless of their social background, and that they should share in their due share of the wealth created by their own labor.

Since the last World War, this group has been at odds with the Communist Party for three reasons: First, the Communist Party has always tried to divide the left wing in politics and trade unions, causing them to waste a lot of time, energy, and money. Second, communism, both in theory and in practice in the Soviet Union, is opposed to free trade unionism, and they are more actively trying to eliminate this branch of the left wing than any right-wing group. Third, and perhaps most profound, is that people who grew up in poverty fear any form of insecurity, so they prefer moderate reforms to the revolution desired by the Communist Party. Therefore, the labor movement of this branch has always criticized the Soviet Union, which is why Bevin and Vyshinsky were so often at odds.

The other part can be said to be the labor movement of the propertied class, the most important of which is Sir Stafford Cripps, a descendant of a landed aristocracy. This movement was founded by his aunt, Beatrice Webb (i.e., Lady Webb). Mr. and Mrs. Webb and several friends organized a society for social reform. The members are mainly middle-class people. These people do not demand "the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness" because they already have these things. They are people of order and have a certain degree of ambition to eliminate disorder in one fell swoop and reform the social institutions of England so that they can harmonize with the changes since the Industrial Revolution and create a strict planned economy.

This thinking deserves our highest respect, because it is indeed essential to harmonize. Mrs. Webb and her group are also devout and capable people. In the Soviet Union, they saw the realization of their ideals. At the same time, they were very pleased that the results of the Bolsheviks were quite satisfactory and enabled government leaders to reform the Communist Party's activities did not interfere with their labor movement organizations, and they themselves had never experienced this kind of insecurity in their lives, which would make them afraid of the revolution. Therefore, they have always given full support to the Soviet Union. This is the case now, and it will probably be the case in the future.

Anyone who thinks that Bevin must have abandoned his earlier ideas before dealing with Molotov either does not understand the division of these two backgrounds of the British left wing or has classified Bevin into another camp.

Bevin's attitude is dignified and serious, with a sense of integrity. He never looks for excuses to forgive himself; he only deals with problems one by one directly. And in the United Nations, he also solved the fundamental problems of all problems. I once asked an American journalist, "What is your impression of the United Nations?" He replied, "My most profound impression is that everything is done on stage, and there is no need to explore any behind-the-scenes secret activities." Because of Bevin's straightforward and frank attitude in the first General Assembly of the United Nations, he has kicked the despicable secret diplomacy of the Tehran and Yalta Conferences to the skies. This is Bevin's style of dealing with people.

### Zhao Family Archway in Nanshi; Ming Dynasty Tombs Excavated and Destroyed; Descendants of Yan Song's Adopted Son, Zhao Wenhua, Impoverished and Selling Ancestral Tombs, Calamity Befalls Bones; Grave Robbery of Burial Objects; Lu Ni Also Involved; Eight Men and Women Have Been Arrested for Strict Investigation

[Our Correspondent] The Penglai Road Police Station in Nanshi cracked a major case of illegally excavating ancient tombs and stealing burial antiques the day before yesterday. The tombs are hundreds of years old, belonging to Zhao Wenhua, adopted son of Yan Song in the late Ming Dynasty, who was a right-wing Zheng Tongsui official. The antiques inside were all embezzled by the "Police Chief" Ying and the "Branch Chief" Jiang Ziyun of Zhonghua Road during the enemy-puppet period. Eight main male and female criminals have now been arrested, and old rifles, bullets, steel helmets, Japanese military uniforms, etc., have been seized. The witnesses were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial this morning. It is reported that Shen Hanlin, who committed many evils during the enemy-puppet period and lives at 441 Jiangyin Street, is a shoemaker. Due to the suspicion of privately purchasing military fire, he was arrested by Police Section Staff Sun Hao and Fu Zhaoxu, led by plainclothes police officer Wang Yimin, at midnight on the 7th of this month. A broken rifle, more than 20 bullets, Japanese military uniforms, and a lawyer's announcement sign for the relocation of ancestral tombs were found. After the witnesses were taken to the police station, Branch Chief Yao Qihong ordered Criminal Section Chief Yao Yuanlong to investigate. According to the confession, on July 5th, 1944, Shen Hanlin participated in the illegal excavation of the tomb of Zhao Wenhua, adopted son of Yan Song in the late Ming Dynasty, located at the Zhao Family Archway on Dalin Road inside Xiaoximen (who was beheaded and buried there after serving as a right-wing Zheng Tongsui official), because Zhao Wang, the widow of Zhao Wenhua, and Zhao Xiaomei, a sister-in-law, sold the tomb land to Huang Xiji due to poverty for 140,000 in currency. However, the buyer insisted on relocating the tomb before paying the money. Therefore, Zhao Wang and others entrusted Rong Wanxiang, a gravedigger also known as She Tou, who specialized in flipping dead bodies at the Nanshi Funeral Home, to hire workers to excavate. Two coffins made of Phoebe nanmu wood were found on the spot, one of which was Zhao Wenhua's coffin. A large number of antiques were found in the coffin, such as jade bracelets, jadeite, jade rings, gold fan crowns, gold hairpins, pearls, beaded flowers, earrings, etc. At that time, Jiang Ziyun, the "Deputy Police Chief" of the "Puppet Zhonghua Road Branch", sent "Inspector" Li Jihua, a puppet officer, to supervise the scene. All the antiques that were unearthed were taken away. Except for a gold fan and two dragon and phoenix jade rings, which were offered to "Police Chief" Ying, another gold fan was swallowed by Pang Zilin, a "puppet officer" of the branch, and the rest were taken by Jiang Ziyun. Branch Chief Yao then ordered the original police officers to bring seven people, including Gu Zilin, Zhao Xiaomei, Zhao Wang, Zhang Rongsheng, Li Jihua, Zhao Ahu, and Rong Wanxiang, to the station for investigation separately. According to Zhao Xiaomei's confession, she had an affair with "Inspector" Li Jihua, and Li Jihua handled the matter of bribing Police Chief Ying. Zhang Rongsheng was a rickshaw puller and also participated in the excavation of the tomb at that time. All the antiques and other items were loaded into his cart and transported elsewhere. Other suspects also confessed. Jiang Ziyun, the main criminal who is still at large, is currently being strictly investigated.

### A Tragic Incident Eight Years Ago: The White Russian Massacre of the Lone Army; A Memorial Ceremony Was Held in Jin Yuan Park Yesterday

On August 11, 1938, the lone army of the 88th Division inside Jiaozhou Park was massacred by White Russian soldiers for requesting to hang a flag in commemoration of the first anniversary of their departure from Wuxi. Yesterday morning at 10:00, led by the widow of former Commander Xie, a memorial ceremony was held in Jin Yuan Park. Many guests, including Chairman Wu Shaoshu, attended, and wreaths from all walks of life were piled up next to the tomb. Recalling the historical traces of the lone army's resistance against Japan, people paid their respects with tears. During the memorial ceremony, the widow of former Commander Xie described in detail the lone army's struggle and stated that on August 11, 1937, nine years ago today, the 88th Division departed from Wuxi to defend Shanghai. Two days later, the "August 13th" battle broke out. After three months of fierce fighting, 800 brave soldiers retreated into Jiaozhou Park under the leadership of former Commander Xie. A year later, to commemorate their departure, they hung a flag and were brutally massacred by the White Russian police officers of the Public Works Department, resulting in the martyrdom of lone army comrades Liu Shangcai, You Changqing, Wu Zude, and Wang Wenyi for the national flag. Chairman Wu then reported on the circumstances in which the underground workers and former Commander Xie fought against the enemy and puppet regime in the same difficult environment at that time. The listeners were all moved to tears. The ceremony ended at around 12:00. (The photo shows Chairman Wu (left) and Mrs. Xie (right) during the memorial ceremony. Photo by China News Agency.)

### Inauguration of Party Affairs Training Class: New Party Members Take Oath

The Shanghai Municipal Party Department held the inauguration of the first Party Affairs Training Class and the eleventh New Party Member Oath Ceremony at the Municipal Gymnasium at 9:30 am yesterday. More than 1,500 new party members and 180 cadres and students of the training class attended. After leading the ceremony, Chen Baohua, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, was followed by Mayor Wu giving instructions, stating that the Party must pay attention to two things in the future: First, sincere unity among comrades to maintain the glorious history of the past and carry it forward; second, to strengthen local efforts. It is necessary to make all compatriots in the country believe that only the Kuomintang can clarify politics and create benefits for the people everywhere, so as to complete the great cause of the Party's revolution and nation-building. Subsequently, all the new party members took an oath under the leadership of Lu Entan, the Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Municipal Party Department. Chairman Wu Shaoshu of the Municipal Government acted as the overseer on behalf of the higher-level party department, and delivered a speech to the students and new party members. Mr. Wu read three important points from the Director-General's instructions to party members and members: (1) Every party member should practice what they preach; (2) Pay special attention to unity among comrades; (3) The essence of revolutionary philosophy lies in recognizing that the purpose of life is to improve the well-being of all mankind, and the meaning of life lies in creating the continuation of cosmic life. All our party members must practice living for the revolution, dying for the revolution, and devoting ourselves to the end. At the end, Chairman Wu issued party certificates, and Secretary Chen led the reading of the party member code of conduct. At 11:00, the General Assembly announced the completion of the ceremony.

### Paper Birds Soaring in the Wind: Model Airplane Competition Held Enthusiastically Yesterday

[Our Own Reporter] With the August 14th Air Force Day approaching, the Chinese Aviation Construction Association, the Air Force Headquarters, and other organizations jointly held a model airplane competition at Hongqiao Airport yesterday. Around 9:00 yesterday morning, the long-desolate, weed-strewn Hongqiao Airport was packed with spectators, numbering nearly a thousand. The participants, mostly students from various large, medium, and small schools, numbered over 230. The flight competition was divided into seven categories: (1) Catapult Gliders, with 9 participants; (2) Hand-Launched Gliders, with 13 participants; (3) Pylon-Towed Gliders, with 13 participants; (4) Fuselage-Towed Gliders, with 25 participants; (5) Pylon-Rubber Band Powered Models, with 89 participants; (6) Fuselage-Rubber Band Powered Models, with 69 participants; (7) Gasoline-Powered Models, with 7 participants.

During each category's competition, the groups were simultaneously divided into four groups: Red, Green, White, and Yellow. Each group was spaced over thirty feet apart, with a colored flag marking their area. Four to five referees were responsible for timing and other duties. The competition was based on flight time to determine the design and performance of the models. Before the competition, each model underwent a rigorous inspection by graduates of the Jiaotong University Aviation Engineering Department, who measured them to ensure they met international standards. The competition began around 10:00 a.m. The participating youth held their handmade models high and took off in turn. For a time, paper birds crisscrossed the blue sky and white clouds, creating a spectacular sight. The model airplanes participating in the competition were almost entirely made of paper and wooden sticks. Very few had entirely wooden fuselages. The light paper and the wind speed of about twelve miles per hour caused many models to flutter uncontrollably after takeoff. The pylon-towed models were the most spectacular, rising against the wind to a height of over fifty feet before releasing the towline, after which the model circled and descended, gliding a great distance. It is said that the highest gliding record in the Chongqing competition was over forty minutes. According to Professor Yang Pengji of the Jiaotong University Aviation Engineering Department, the chief referee at yesterday's event, the materials in Shanghai are superior to those in the interior, and the designs are excellent, so the national record may be broken. However, the exact records and the rankings of the winners in each category will not be announced until the calculations are completed in the next few days. The entire competition ended at 5:00 p.m. yesterday.

[Another Report] At approximately 11:00 a.m. yesterday, U.S. Air Force Second Transport Group Captain Dahl, accompanied by two teammates, brought a self-made fuselage gasoline model to the airport for demonstration. The wingspan of the yellow model was approximately one foot. It was a true-to-life model of a Ryan-style monoplane trainer, equipped with a miniature gasoline engine, reportedly newly shipped from the United States. It was said to be able to fly at a speed of seventy-five miles per hour for fifteen minutes. The plane attempted to take off twice, but failed due to the plywood runway, which was both too short and uneven. The first time, the propeller broke when it collided with the ground just seven meters from the end of the runway. The second time, the newly replaced propeller was too small and lacked sufficient thrust, so it also failed to take off.

### Duanmu Kai Does Not Serve as Senator: Zhu Wenbin Substituted According to Law

[This Newspaper Report] Amidst the flurry of municipal senators reporting for duty, lawyer Duanmu Kai, elected senator for the Dachang District, suddenly announced to reporters yesterday: He had never intended to accept the position, so he would not attend the inaugural meeting on the 13th. He stated: Having been away from Shanghai for nearly a decade, he was inevitably out of touch with the city's situation. He has already been elected as a National Political Council member and cannot attend to both. Therefore, he wrote to the Civil Affairs Bureau on July 26th, stating his position. Answering reporters' inquiries, he said that the reason he was unable to clearly state his position earlier was that the validity of the municipal senator election had not yet been determined. Now that he knows the election is valid, he should declare that he will not accept the position, so that a substitute candidate can be appointed. It is further reported: Duanmu's resignation has been approved, and candidate senator Zhu Wenbin has been selected to substitute according to law.

### Substitute Senators Petition, Requesting the Right to Speak

The inaugural meeting of the first Municipal Senate is scheduled to be held tomorrow.

### Adjudicating Housing Disputes

Housing Management Committee Will Be the Sole Agency, Requesting Courts to Send Personnel to Handle Cases Jointly

Director Wu of the Housing Rental Management Committee informed reporters yesterday that the government has passed amendments to the Housing Dispute Resolution Measures, which will be sent to the Executive Yuan for approval within days. Approval is expected to be problem-free. At that time, the Housing Management Committee will become the sole agency for adjudicating all housing disputes, and the courts will be requested to send personnel to participate and handle cases jointly. Regarding the future new work of the Housing Management Committee, the first step will be to investigate the rental relationships in the city over the years to clarify whether there are any illegal rental relationships (such as using gold bars to secure housing), in order to take steps to ban them. The elimination of second landlords is a consistent goal of the Housing Management Committee, so as to gradually establish a direct relationship between third tenants and the primary landlord, eliminating intermediate exploitation. The next task is to investigate vacant houses in the city. If vacant houses are found, they will be forced to be rented out to alleviate the housing shortage. Regarding the construction of affordable housing, it is said that due to financial difficulties, it has not yet become concrete.

### Investigation Team Leader Zhang Zhiben Says He Will Never Trust "Reimbursement Accounts"

[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Zhiben, the leader of the investigation team for the takeover work, told our reporter yesterday: The reports from the various takeover agencies have all been submitted, and all the committee members have reviewed them. Judging from the reports alone, the takeover work is generally good and without any problems. Therefore, the investigation team is currently collecting materials and evidence from the side to achieve the purpose of the investigation. Team leader Zhang specifically pointed out that our country's long-standing "reimbursement policy" reverses right and wrong and is extremely harmful. The authorities often only consider the rationality of the reimbursement as a test of the work. Therefore, those who are good but not good at reimbursement are wronged, while mediocre and corrupt people use the cleverness of reimbursement to be praised by the authorities. Team leader Zhang gave an example and said: The investigation team's investigation policy focuses on collecting materials from multiple sources and listening to opinions from multiple sources, and will never trust "reimbursement accounts." When asked whether the fifty-day deadline could complete the mission, Team leader Zhang replied: If we step up our work, fifty days is not short. If the work is slack, even a hundred days is not enough, so the team does not plan to extend the deadline for the work.

Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and Jin Liang, the director of the First Section of the Bureau, also attended. Chairman Wang Xianqing explained the significance of the election and hoped that female civil servants in the city would make a deeper contribution to social charity work. Director Zhang then gave a speech, stating: "I hope that everyone can embrace the determination to give up self for others in this great era, to establish merit, establish virtue, and establish a career. Participating in the election to help relieve the refugees in Northern Jiangsu is a very glorious thing. I hope that the mobilization of all of you can inspire female civil servants from all agencies in the city to respond enthusiastically." Sixteen people immediately joined the list of candidates for the socialite group, including Hu Jingxia, Huang Yuru, Wang Shizhen, Wu Fengying, Chen Xiufen, Jin Siyuan, Fang Ling, Fu Yueying, Chen Peimin, Fan Xiyuan, Sun Qingyun, Shao Meixin, Wang Diyin, Gao Weijuan, Wang Guangcui, and Zheng Caiqi, all female staff members of the Civil Affairs Bureau.

Baoshan Natives Save Food to Help Disaster Relief

In addition to having my family of three save three days' worth of food, worth 20,000 yuan in national currency, which I personally handed over to Mr. Leng Yuqiu to be delivered to the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. Now, the elders and workers in my hometown of Baoshan, out of sympathy, are saving food to help the Northern Jiangsu refugees who have suffered from the Communist disaster, totaling 1 million yuan in national currency, which is sent to your newspaper by special personnel, requesting that it be remitted to the Zhenjiang Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association immediately to purchase food for relief, and requesting that it be published in the newspaper to call on the elders in the southern Jiangsu counties to join in this righteous cause to save the millions of refugees in Northern Jiangsu. Respectfully, Yuan Xiluo." This newspaper immediately complied with Yuan's intentions and handed over the funds to the Social Service Section to be remitted to the Zhenjiang Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association to purchase food for the refugees to show its advocacy.

### China Musical Theater: Rehearsing in the Summer Heat: Wang Yuan and Bai Yuwei Will Soon Go Abroad

[This Newspaper Report] Under the leadership of musician Aiyi Galomov, the China Musical Theater is still rushing to rehearse these days despite the recent sweltering heat. The repertoires that have been rehearsed include "Meng Jiangnu," "Five Planets," and "Rippling Heartstrings." It is said that a large part of "Rippling Heartstrings" is adapted from the Beijing opera "Fisherman's Revenge." It is also reported that the troupe is scheduled to go abroad in mid-October, with a total of more than 30 people, including actors and staff. Among them, the famous dancer Wang Yuan has signed a contract with the troupe, with a very low salary. During the rehearsal period, she receives a monthly subsidy of 100 US dollars for transportation and meals. After going to the United States, it will increase to 150 US dollars. Also, because Wang Yuan suffers from heart disease, she can no longer continue with strenuous Western dance. The performances she participates in with the troupe are only gentle Chinese dances. The famous performers Bai Yuwei and Li Shifang have been hired by the troupe and may go to the United States to participate in the performance. They have already participated in rehearsals. Last Monday, they showed off their skills at Yiyuan. Li Shifang performed a section from "Farewell My Concubine," and Bai Yuwei performed with ribbons. It is also said that their remuneration is planned by the troupe to be 800 US dollars, but Bai Yuwei said that she is not satisfied, so whether it will happen is still difficult to decide.

### Questions and Answers on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Second Series)

(52) Question: Article 19 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that household registration should be registered in accordance with the number assigned by the autonomous region within the jurisdictional area. Does this autonomous region refer to the Baojia system?

Answer: The Household Registration Law was promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic of China, and Article 3 stipulates that the township area of a county and the fang area of a city are the jurisdictional areas. Therefore, the autonomous regional division within the jurisdictional area stipulated in Article 19 refers to the Lu Lin within the townships and fangs before the implementation of the Household Registration Law. Since the promulgation of the County-Level Organization Outline in Article 28 and the Municipal Organization Law in the 32nd year, the names of Fang, Ban, and Lin no longer exist. In the future, household registration and personnel registration should temporarily use the township of the county and the district of the city as the jurisdictional area.

(53) Question: The Household Registration Law does not provide for receipts for reading fees, copying fees, and fines. Which agency should formulate them, what format should they be, and what should this income be used for?

Answer: The county government can formulate and issue the format itself. Since the amount of this fee is not much, it can be allocated to the township office for household administration expenses, but it must be reported to the county government for approval before it can be used.

### District Briefs

Chen Bingguo, the city councilor elected in the Twenty-Ninth District, was originally also a district people's representative.

The Fifth District Office (Taishan) is scheduled to handle its own handover at 10 AM on the 14th of this month. In addition to preparing various forms and tables, it has submitted a request to the Civil Affairs Department to send personnel to supervise the handover at that time.

Zhong Keto, the District Chief of the Fourteenth District, has been selected as a representative of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles to petition in Beijing. Yesterday, he reported to the Municipal Government for a four-day leave, and the district affairs will be temporarily handled by Deputy District Chief Sun Jingqi.

### The Issue of Factory Closures Is Under Meticulous Study

[Our Dispatch] Since the industrial and commercial crisis has become increasingly profound, some companies have adopted austerity policies, laying off employees and reducing their scope in an attempt to barely survive. Others have taken decisive measures, such as closing factories or stores, to avoid depleting their expenses. In the past month or so, such events have increased daily, and companies have reported to the authorities for record-keeping or requested instructions on how to deal with the remaining employees after the factory closure. It is heard that the authorities are handling this matter with extreme caution. Currently, the unemployment problem is very serious, and they are trying their best to resettle unemployed workers who have come to Shanghai from this city and the rear. Although the Temporary Relief Committee for Unemployed Workers established after the victory has expired, they will find ways to reorganize it and continue to provide relief. To maintain social stability, employed workers must not be allowed to become unemployed. However, it is also a fact that most of these factories and companies are unable to sustain themselves. Moreover, industries and businesses are free to close voluntarily for certain reasons under the law. According to the new Company Law, if the capital is depleted to one-third and the shareholders' meeting is not convened to discuss whether to continue or stop, the board of directors and staff are responsible. Therefore, whether to approve their opening and closing of factories and stores, and how to dismiss all employees after the factory closure, are currently under meticulous study.

### The Ministry of Economic Affairs Stipulates Factory Registration Measures

Since the revised factory registration regulations were promulgated on March 25th of the 30th year of the Republic of China, most factories have registered according to law, but there are still many that have not registered. After the victory, there were even more changes in factories in various places, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs urgently needs to understand all the changes. Therefore, it recently instructed the Municipal Government to supervise the Social Affairs Bureau to comply with the following three regulations: (1) Whether newly established or old, all factories that have not received a registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs should quickly fill out a registration form and submit it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for verification and issuance of a registration certificate. (2) Regardless of whether registered or unregistered, all factories should report the types and amounts of products from the previous year, as well as the production plans for this year and the next year, truthfully to the Ministry. (3) All factories that have a registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and have suspended operations should submit the original certificate to the Ministry for cancellation. Those that have temporarily resumed operations should also state the reasons and report to the Ministry.

### Rayon Prices Rise Steadily, but Unable to Surge

At the beginning of the week, it was within the 500,000 yuan range, and by the weekend it was 630,000 yuan, a total increase of 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. Miscellaneous 120 glossy followed Tianqiao. 150 glossy and 120 semi-glossy were less expensive due to sluggish sales, rising by about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan last week. 75 Golden Rooster semi-glossy also rose sharply, starting at 460,000 to 470,000 yuan at the beginning of the week and reaching 1,060,000 yuan on Saturday. Factory warp market conditions were relatively quiet at the beginning of last week, but improved slightly at the weekend. Each warp rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Silk fabrics lingered in a state of fatigue. Meiya's prices rose sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while Dacheng's plaid [fabrics] were no longer in season and could not rise, ending at around 4,600 yuan with extremely rare transactions. Huajin crepe had some inquiries and followed the raw materials to rise, starting within the 2,000 yuan range at the beginning of the week and reaching 2,100 yuan by the weekend. Currently, autumn sales of silk fabrics have not yet moved, and all manufacturers are exhausted under the pressure of high wages and high interest rates. The establishment of a silk industry bank and the provision of small loans to silk merchants will provide some small assistance to silk merchants.

### The Bean and Rice Industry Standardizes Bushels Yesterday

In order to facilitate the loading and unloading of rice grains for merchants, the bean and rice industry in this city has restored the system of using bushels of rice. It specially requested the approval of the Rice Grain Industry Association and the Changshu Rice Industry Association. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the first standardization of bushels was held at the Xie Youlue Zuxiu Hall. More than 200 rice bushels were sent by the rice shops for standardization.

All the bushels were standardized by 4 PM.

Consolidate New Instruments and Eliminate Old Instruments

The implementation steps are to carry out inspection and examination at the same time. The inspection work of small vegetable markets and vendors in each district has been completed. Currently, they are rushing to inspect rice shops throughout the city. If it is discovered that the shops and vegetable vendors that have already been inspected are still using instruments illegally, they hope that all sectors of society will assist in reporting them.

### Returning Hong Kong Residents Talk: Hong Kong Gradually Restoring Old Appearance, Government and People Maintaining Each Other, Everything Back on Track

[Our Newspaper Report] Since Hong Kong's restoration, its commercial situation has gradually returned to its former state. Six factors contribute to this: (1) No excessive taxes and levies. The Hong Kong government's tax revenue consists only of port taxes and police levies, without various new categories. (2) Credit currency prevails. Checks can be used to replace cash. Merchants consider dishonoring checks a disgraceful act. The Hong Kong government, to ensure merchants respect credit and trustworthiness, requires that all commercial transactions, such as sales contracts, be certified by lawyers and the authorities with a seal, to have legal effect. Therefore, neither party dares to easily break their word and bring trouble upon themselves. (3) Bank lending rates are extremely low. Banks do not pay interest on demand deposits but offer an annual interest rate of 3% on fixed deposits. Loans only charge a monthly interest rate of 6%. Thus, merchants can overdraw funds from banks to operate industrial and commercial businesses, which is far better than the high interest rates in Shanghai. (4) Buildings in Hong Kong destroyed by artillery fire have now been repaired or new buildings have been added. It is said that many foreign merchant property companies are selling their businesses in Shanghai and investing huge sums in Hong Kong to build large buildings, so the city is densely built and has quickly returned to its former appearance. (5) Although Hong Kong's trade has not yet returned to pre-war standards, the United Kingdom is actively trying to ship goods to Hong Kong in order to restore its Far East market. (6) Life is stable, and labor disputes are much more relaxed, unlike the disturbances here, which make the industrial and commercial circles hesitate. The above points were discussed by returning Hong Kong residents. Recording this for reference.

### Hong Kong Bans Newspaper Exports

[Hong Kong News] Regarding the export of foreign newspapers here, it was previously approved that over 70% could be exported. Now, due to sluggish supply, the market has suddenly become scarce. Therefore, the authorities have now decided to temporarily prohibit the export of newspapers.

### Summer Sales Have Passed, Autumn Sales Await: Woolen Fabric Industry Looks Forward and Backward, Small Businesses Already in Associations Feel Especially Depressed

[Our Newspaper Report] The summer sales season for woolen fabrics has now passed, and the autumn sales season is approaching. As for the winter sales season, it is impossible to predict due to uncertainty about large-scale imports from abroad, and many fail due to the pressure of high-interest loans. Learning from previous mistakes, everyone is afraid to hoard goods. Buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Also, seeing that those who rushed to buy Melton early suffered losses, they are even more cautious. Looking at the recent market trends for autumn woolen fabrics, most prices have been driven high by summer goods. In addition, the inventory in Shanghai is lacking, especially for fine wool and glossy goods. Customer demand is gradually increasing. Imports from England are still pending. Although there are transshipments from Hong Kong, they are a drop in the bucket and far from sufficient. Some American goods have arrived, but apart from Melton women's fabrics, the quantity is also small, and the quality is not good, so people are still optimistic.

Looking back at the summer sales season for woolen fabrics around the Dragon Boat Festival, initial prices were generally considered too high, and there was mutual price cutting. Unexpectedly, the sales unexpectedly progressed greatly, and all goods became more in demand than supply. Prices soared. Due to the shortage of circulating goods in the market, those who held goods could ask any price they wanted, with no standard. There was often a difference of three to five thousand yuan per yard between different sellers, which was not surprising. However, transactions were mostly small and fragmented, because users who were not in urgent need were unwilling to stock up. For example, worsted yarn, palicos, and valentino, which sold for around 40,000 yuan in counterfeit currency per yard at this time last year, were priced at 30,000 yuan in legal tender this summer, then rose to over 50,000 yuan, and then to 70,000 yuan. The shortage and soaring prices of woolen fabrics led to the great activity in the sales of waxed thread, adhesive cloth, and various grades of burlap such as 945, 948, and 950. At the same time, the Air Force's popular American-style khaki rainproof cloth was selling widely and unexpectedly, with prices soaring. Manufacturers of rainproof cloth were making three times their profit. A custom-made suit of clothes generally cost 60,000 to 100,000 yuan in legal tender. Two years ago, the price of a custom-made suit of golden woolen fabric was not so high.

Currently, the cost of operations is increasing, and capital is limited. (More than ten people have gone bankrupt due to high-interest loans). English and American woolen fabrics are being ordered in large quantities. In the near future, they will inevitably arrive in a continuous stream. What will be the future of the woolen fabric market and prices? Every practitioner is wondering. The summer sales season is over, and whether autumn sales will be smooth is a cause for anxiety. In particular, small businesses that have recently been established and have joined the association feel especially depressed.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Plan: Purchasing Jardine Matheson Ships, Opening Southeast Asia Route

After the victory, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received over 400,000 tons of enemy and puppet ships, and also successively received many landing craft and Liberty ships transferred by the US military. The total tonnage is sufficient for the needs of various domestic routes. It is reported that in order to expand overseas routes, the company has purchased several large ships suitable for sailing in the open ocean from Jardine Matheson, a British company. It will make its maiden voyage between China and the Southeast Asian islands in the near future. [illegible]

### Li Feng Tannery: Shanghai Factory Opened Yesterday

Li Feng Tannery opened yesterday. During the war, the factory moved to Chongqing, producing Bee Ball brand industrial belts and leather goods for the army, navy, and air force. After the victory, it returned to Shanghai to restore its operations. It is reported that the factory base and equipment now in operation are all owned by the former Jingchan China Leather Factory, and are new and complete. It produces 100,000 feet of leather belts per month. In addition, waterproof leather belts are also a new discovery in the domestic goods industry.

### Stopping Foreign Coal Procurement: Domestic Products Sufficient for Self-Supply

The Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan previously approved merchants to order and import foreign coal due to the lack of domestic coal. Some of it came from Pearl Harbor, Canada, and other places. Over 20,000 tons have already arrived, and the rest are en route to China. It is reported that the authorities believe that importing foreign coal incurs a large amount of foreign exchange, and the domestic fuel transportation situation has improved. In fact, there is no need to import foreign coal. Therefore, it has been decided that from yesterday, the measures for encouraging merchants to procure and transport foreign coal, promulgated by the Fuel Management Committee in February of this year, will be abolished. Subsequently, the committee will be responsible for purchasing coal domestically, and will do its best to unblock sources and supply the needs of the entire city.

### American Oil Reserves Are Half Gone: Annual Consumption Is 1.7 Billion Barrels

[United Press Michigan 10th] US Secretary of the Interior Krug stated here today that the United States will soon feel a shortage of oil. Half of the known underground oil reserves in the United States have already been used, and finding and exploiting the other half will be more difficult. He said that the total oil reserves in the United States are about 21,000,000,000 barrels, and the current annual consumption is 1,700,000,000 barrels.

### Zinc and Copper: The United States Has Restricted Exports

[Reuters New York 11th] Zinc plates, zinc nails, zinc ingots, etc. in the United States have now been placed under export control. Any exports must first apply for an export license. Also, the export of copper and copper products must also apply for an export license.

### Chongqing Merchants' Export Surplus Foreign Exchange: Bank of China Approves Purchase at Current Rate

[Chongqing 10th] Previously, during the effective period of the export and transportation of foreign exchange settlement goods, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, all export foreign exchange settlement adopted the method of offsetting imports of essential goods, and the goods could only be shipped for export after completing the foreign exchange settlement procedures. However, after the announcement of the new exchange rate, there are still quite a few export foreign exchange earnings that have not been settled in accordance with the original exchange rate (one to twenty). Now, the Import and Export Trade Association [illegible] is applying for the Central Bank to purchase [illegible] surplus foreign exchange earned by [illegible] exports at the current exchange rate in order to avoid losses to merchants. It is reported that the Central Bank has replied by telegram approving this request.

### The Main Reasons for the Current Decline of Industry in Our Country

— Zhang Bo'an

In this era when our country's politics and economy are becoming increasingly complex, the domestic industrial and commercial sectors are generally declining! Domestic public opinion has repeatedly raised opinions and made urgent appeals, but this declining trend will only worsen, which is to be expected.

Industry is the lifeblood of a country. Without industry, there is no country. Looking at this World War, rather than being a mutual slaughter of human beings, it is more accurately a competition of industries. If the Allied countries did not have the highly developed industry of the United States as a backing, the outcome of the war could not have been determined! The Axis powers relied on their strong industries and did not hesitate to become enemies of the world; however, when the competition reached its limit, there could not be even the slightest difference. Comparing our country's industry with the world's powers, it can truly be said that we are a country "without industry." Precisely because its organization is weak, it cannot withstand a single blow in the economic turmoil. The current suffering of our country's industry and the main reasons for its inability to survive are: first, the lack of industrial capital; second, the inability of finished products to compete with foreign goods; and third, the high cost of manufacturing. These three reasons have led to the industrial collapse of today.

Why is there a lack of industrial capital? Before currency values are stabilized and before usury disappears, I dare say that there will never be a source of industrial capital. Industry is the slowest type of investment of all investments. Industrial production is not as flexible as commercial distribution. Its success cannot be seen in a year and a half. Before the war, some factories in our country took ten years to make a profit, and some even lost money. However, this approach created a solid foundation for them. Even if they were subjected to external fluctuations, they always stood firm. Therefore, in the current era of usury and profiteering, do you think there are still such fools who will invest in industry? This is one.

If you want the financial industry to invest money in factories, that is also wishful thinking. How much ability does the financial industry itself have to divert this large amount of working capital into non-performing loans is also a big question. This is two.

Industrial investment, to be honest, relies on the private sector. Now, our country's industrial conditions, as Liu Gongyun said, are those of the 19th century, which will inevitably be completely eliminated. Now, everyone in the country knows that running industry is important, but everyone also knows that the future of industry can determine its failure? Therefore, private capital cannot be introduced into industrial investment. This is three.

Next, we must talk about the problem of domestic goods not being able to compete with foreign goods. For every industrial product, first, it must compete, and you have no choice but to compete. The result of competition is, of course, the survival of the fittest. This is an inevitable principle.

Second, products must meet "purchasing power." With the same quality and the same goods, if Factory A sells for 10,000 and Factory B sells for 20,000, the former is suitable for "purchasing power." Moreover, when foreign goods are only "promoting sales" and cannot yet be said to be "dumping," Chinese industry is already loudly calling for help. In the future, once there is a real "dumping," what methods can be used to resist it? In short, with foreign goods, there is no choice but to compete. If you don't have the ability to compete, the only result is decline.

Again, the high cost of manufacturing is a fact, but it is not immutable. In all countries of the world, the manufacturing cost of industry is only decreasing, unlike our country, which is increasing day by day. The reason is due to the waste of "manpower" and the lack of utilization of "power" in our country's industry. In other countries, the "manpower" involved in transporting raw materials to the production of products is minimal. Currently, the production of a product in our country almost entirely requires "manpower." At a time when "wages" are rising higher than any commodity price, the difference between the use of "manpower" and "power" cannot be measured. Therefore, to seek the survival of industry, we must eliminate "manpower" as much as possible and use "power." This is the only condition for reducing production costs. In addition, in the present state where the agricultural foundation has not yet been established, it is impossible to reduce the cost of industrial production, because the decline in agricultural production is the increase in the raw materials for industrial production, and the finished product cannot meet the current "purchasing power."

Based on the above discussion, the country should have an overall plan for our country's industrial problems. Without planned industry, even if people with good intentions can make efforts according to their "artificial" efforts, I am afraid it will be in vain.

In April of last year, the US Foreign Economic Administration drew up a plan for planned industry for our country, which included 604 types of industries and the distribution of national regions, completely in accordance with modern industrial production conditions. However, the entire case is over 2,000 pages long. We only saw an outline. It is best to ask the government to publish the full text for Chinese industrialists to study, so that people will not be at a dead end and not know what to do!

Finally, we must also say that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, manpower, financial resources, and material resources were all taken from the countryside. The vitality is exhausted, and anemia has reached its extreme. Purchasing power has dropped to zero. Therefore, the current decline and even total collapse of all industrial and commercial sectors proves that the Chinese countryside is dying. I hope that those who talk about China's industrial construction will pay more attention to this point.

### Hsinchu: Taiwan's Healthy Zone

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taiwan Airlines Report, Third of this Month

In Taiwan, medical scientists and hygienists consider Hsinchu to be the most standard and rare healthy zone. This healthy zone is based on a reasonable geographical situation. It is surrounded by mountains on the east, north, and south sides, and faces the strait on the west side. It is also the most prominent part of [illegible]. From the urban area to the seaside, it is only eight Chinese miles, and the temperature is constantly maintained at 21.4 degrees Celsius. The most easily felt seasonal winds are quite strong here. Therefore, Taiwan has "Hsinchu winds and Yilan rains." Hsinchu's winds and Yilan's rains are characteristics given to these two places by heaven. Because of the strong winds, germs spread through the air are not easy to stay in this area, which purifies Hsinchu.

On the Tainan transportation line, Hsinchu is like Suzhou in Jiangsu. It is the first large station passed through from Taipei to Tainan. The streets are wide asphalt roads, neat roadside trees, and shops. The Japanese era called it magnificent. Comparing this modern urban sentiment to Suzhou is probably a distance of an era! The people who live here clearly remember things that happened just 235 years ago. More than one hundred Fujianese people braved the sea and floated to Zhqian Port (now the old port). They used collective force to drive out the entrenched aborigines. This barren land is the original Hsinchu City, one of Taiwan's five major cities today.

This area should be healthy, but the people of Hsinchu are very severely plagued by abuse and sexually transmitted diseases. Recently, because of the discovery of plague, it was necessary to launch a widespread pre-emptive epidemic prevention campaign.

### The City Government Complains About Poverty Every Day

Hsinchu faces the same fate as other cities. Because there is a large-scale airfield, more than 40% of it was destroyed by bombing, especially the eastern part of the city, which was the most severely bombed. The original commercial area was destroyed and forced to move to the west, but because the capacity of the West Gate Market is limited, a congested situation filling the streets remains, leaving a wartime scene. The city government originally controlled nine districts and has been reorganized into seven districts: East, South, West, North, Xiangshan, Zhudong, and Baoshan. After the merger, the original population of 56,000 has increased to over 117,000. Because Zhudong is an industrial area with production and minerals, the redrawing of boundaries caused fierce disputes between the county and the city. In the end, the city government won!

Mayor Guo Shaozong is a receiving staff member who came to Taiwan after the restoration. He told reporters that the repairs of bombed roads, bridges, sewers, and landing panels are scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. The waterworks project will be completed by the end of August. The repair of gas leaks and the plugging of leaks are also in progress.

Education is quite developed in the urban area, with 15 national schools, 231 classes, and over 10,000 enrolled children, one municipal middle school, and four provincial middle schools, including commercial, industrial, women's middle schools, and ordinary middle schools. The prevalent disease in all municipal schools is salary arrears. The mayor frankly said—all kinds of plans are impossible to implement without money. The city government treasury complains about poverty every day. The budget of 46 million for the 35th fiscal year has not yet been approved. Tax collection will start on July 15, but it will not be possible until the new grain is harvested in August. This period of shortage is not just the city of Hsinchu, but anemia is prevalent throughout the province.

Has the financial policy been determined? People are asking, but the echo is no.

### Industrial City Plan

According to the city government's plan, Hsinchu City may leap to become a modern industrial city. The conditions it possesses are natural resources, convenient transportation, and a concentration of most factories. In particular, Zhudong, the lifeline of Hsinchu City, passes through the Baoshan mining area, which is 17 kilometers away. There, natural gas is produced that is comparable in quality to the crude oil produced in Kettleman, California, in the western United States (the entire island can produce 30 crude oil wells, with an annual output of 23,400 barrels. The entire island has more than one hundred natural gas wells, almost all of which are in the western part of the island). Limestone, silica sand, etc., and coal reserves are even more abundant, and they are the best coking coal on the island, so steel can be smelted. There is also the Southern Cement Factory with an annual output of 100,000 tons, and the wood produced in the mountains. In December of the 33rd year of the Japanese era, the construction of a railway began here with a total cost of 4.55 million Taiwan dollars, which was expected to be completed in one year and four months. As a result, the shrinkage of the wartime economy caused them to complete only 40%. Last year, the city government formulated a plan to complete this railway, with an estimated cost of 7.89 million yuan. Because it was not approved for a long time, the price of goods increased this year, and it had to be increased to 29 million yuan, which was recently approved. It is clear who should bear the responsibility for this invisibly increased loss. The authorities' prudence is certainly necessary, but prices have betrayed the constraints of government laws; as a result, the entire national loss was paid to time.

### Building an Industrial Railway

The industrial railway from Hsinchu to Zhudong is now using the existing rails and sleepers and will start construction immediately. If there are no accidents, old locomotives can be used to transport goods and passengers within half a year. Mayor Guo said that this road, with Zhudong as its terminus, will also become the industrial center.

According to accurate estimates, more than 10,000 tons of wood, more than 5,000 tons (MT) of fuel, 7,000 tons of rice, more than 400,000 tons of bamboo forests, and more than 5,000 tons of fruit can be transported from the production area in the future. The coal transported from the "Ghana brand" coal mine as the central location, the Southern Cement Company providing and producing 400,000 tons of limestone, as well as silica sand and fiber, are all provided and produced by the existing Imperial Petroleum Company, Ghana Brand Coal Mine, Shiono Chemical Co., Ltd., and Uematsu Lumber Factory.

The 600,000-volt transformer of the Natural Gas Research Institute was destroyed by bombing and is still under construction. The Shiono Chemical Factory is a factory that uses the mandarin oranges and other raw materials produced in the city to manufacture scented oil for sale outside the province. Uematsu's current lumber production capacity is only 100,000 stone. If the Lucheng Mountain area can be developed in the future, Zhudong will need lumber equipment with an annual output of 200,000 stone.

### Small-Scale Modern Port

The fatal flaw of Hsinchu industrial city is the lack of an export trade port. The municipal authorities are planning to build a small-scale modern port at Nanliao (the old port) on the coast. The Touqian River and Fengshan River, which originate from the inland areas of the island, flow into the sea from here. It is only 130-odd li to Fuzhou and only 160 li to Xiamen, which is about 70 li closer than Keelung. Hsinchu is the closest point on the coastline of Taiwan to the coastline of Fujian Province. The Japanese once considered it a commercial port, but because the port was silted up, the sea breeze was strong, and the port lacked equipment, the current average number of ships coming from Fuzhou is only twenty-seven or eight per month, with imported goods weighing about ten tons. If this port can be rebuilt, so that ships can enter and leave without being affected by shallow water and strong winds, it is estimated that the tonnage of cargo handled can be increased dozens to hundreds of times per month. At the same time, the abundant milkfish production and the aquatic industry can be developed.

The planned width of the old port entrance is 30 meters, the width inside the port is 100 meters, and the total length is 250 meters. Wharves and revetments will also be constructed. The lowest low tide level inside the port is below 2 meters. The eastern bank wall is 250 meters long and will be used as a fishing ground to store fish. Land-based buildings related to fishing port facilities will be built on the back side. The southwestern bank wall is 250 meters long and will be used as a commercial port, with warehouses and shops behind it. To prevent the impact of floods from the Touqian River and high tides, flood defense dikes will be built. This will accommodate 70 machine fishing boats under 30 tons, 20 steamships under 100 tons, and 30 sailboats, for a total of 120 vessels. The first mayor said that the industrialized and modernized city of Hsinchu has the potential to be completed, and now it is even more necessary to complete a truly healthy city.

### Voice of Xuzhou

— Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th, by Guo Jiannong

After nine years of absence, upon returning, everything in Xuzhou today, in my eyes, seems to have changed. When I, as a veteran, took the first step into Xuzhou, what immediately caught my eye were the wide roads and tall foreign-style buildings. Two main lines, running horizontally and vertically, cut through Xuzhou, even wider than the roads in Nanjing by one-third. When the enemy occupied Xuzhou, they listed Xuzhou as one of the six major cities in North China and used the economic power of the puppet Reformed Government to carry out construction. Later, it was changed to the Central China Special Zone, and the northern funds could not be replenished, so it was stopped. Therefore, the city's construction was not completed. After the recovery, due to the disturbances of the Communist army on the periphery, it was still in a state of military affairs, so naturally there was no time for this. Although the county council had a construction committee, it was only in the design stage, and it was difficult to realize at present. The loss of materials during the takeover also invisibly reduced the power of construction, which is regrettable!

New Urban Buildings and Refugee Tent Shelters

At the same time, in a corner of society, what is reflected is the new buildings of the new city: refugee tent shelters. Along the Jinpu Railway in the east of the city and near the east side of Yunlong Mountain in the south of the city, the shantytowns are closely packed, all built with reed mats, resembling military tents. Widows and children gather, spreading their bedding on the ground. When it rains, the roofs leak, and the ground is wet, with mud and water reaching the ankles. Although relief organizations and local people are doing their best to provide relief, they feel that there is too little porridge for too many monks. I remember when I passed through Zhenjiang, I talked to Wang Gongyu, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, about the construction of Xuzhou. Wang sighed and said that the difficult matter at present is the relief issue. This is indeed a serious problem. According to estimates, there are no less than tens of thousands of refugees near Xuzhou, and even more households are displaced in the countryside. Wealthy households have become refugees, and poor families are all engaged in hard labor. Thugs and ruffians are the central cadres in the "liberated areas." I have traveled through Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, and have not seen such a catastrophe along the way. "Who is responsible for this? Who caused this?" I cannot help but feel resentful towards these perpetrators.

The Main Culprit in Robbery Cases is Executed, Property Rights are Cleared but Not Completely

The society in Xuzhou cannot yet be called stable. A few months ago, robberies occurred in the streets at night. It is said that the perpetrators were related to a certain department. After the case was solved, they could not escape the facts and have been executed. There have been no such incidents in the past two or three months, which can be considered a good phenomenon. However, what the people feel most painful about is the clearing of property rights. It is said that there have been five or six registrations and investigations, and all kinds of procedures have been completed. Recently, the Suzhou office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and the Xuzhou branch have been sealed again, executing provisional attachment. Recently, the chairmen of the Commerce, Agriculture, Industry, Education, and Women's Associations jointly sent a letter to the office, publicly questioning three items in the Xuzhou newspaper: (1) Private real estate that has been occupied or rebuilt by the enemy and puppets, and whose private property rights have been cleared by the municipal government or the Public and Private Property Rights Clearing Committee, and have obtained a management license, why has your office sealed it again after coming to Xuzhou? Is the previous handling by the municipal government and the Clearing Committee legal? (2) The houses sealed after the sealing are nominally provisionally attached, but why are there further sealing incidents after the provisional attachment? (3) After the people's property has been cleared in accordance with the law and the property rights have been determined, the government should protect it in accordance with the law. What will be the final disposition of such provisional attachments or further sealing in the long run? This running account is enough to be settled, and there are also troops stationed in military units occupying official units for retention. The people's requests to resume business are not granted, and there are thousands of problems. How will it be solved?

Organizing Armed Home Returning Corps, Refugees Advance with the Army

The military development is the best phenomenon in Xuzhou at present. Refugees from various counties organize armed home returning corps and advance with the military. Xuzhou West has recovered Xiaoxian County, and Xuzhou East has recovered Shuanggou. There is development in all directions. However, the Longhai East Road has been severely damaged by the Communist army. The railway from Baitabu to A'hu East Sluice Gate has been completely destroyed, the bridge holes of the Grand Canal have been blown up, and the roadbed between the artillery car and Zhaodun has been dug up. The Railway Bureau is rushing to repair it with the army. Recently, it has been reported that 10,000 Communist troops have gathered north of Zhaodun, and disguised teams have been discovered south of the Yanhuang section of the West Road. 10,000 troops have also been added to support Shuanggou. It is said that the National Army plans to first clear the south of the Longhai line and then sweep after the sorghum is harvested. However, the people in the water and fire all want to get rid of their hellish lives as soon as possible and hope for a swift sweep and clearing.

The education in Xuzhou can be said to be quite developed. There is currently one national school (National Normal College), four provincial schools (Jiangsu College, Xuzhou Middle School, Xuzhou Normal School, Xuzhou Women's Normal School), one municipal middle school (Municipal Middle School), one county middle school (County Middle School), and seven private middle schools (Xin Xin, Peizheng, Ding Ming, September 18th, Ziyang, Dapeng, Yunlong). In terms of primary schools, each town has a central school. The number of students in each middle school is mostly over ten classes, and some central schools have as many as thirty classes. With the expansion of the urban area and the increase in population, the number of students has also increased. All schools are currently enrolling students, and there are indeed many applicants. However, the Department of Education has not issued a clear order for the placement of veterans, which is felt to be slow and incomplete.

Material Construction Requires Intensified Spiritual Construction

Finally, let's talk about the public opinion in Xuzhou. Among the newspapers that were re-published before the war, only the Xuzhou Newspaper was re-published. Although the Minbao was also re-published, it was stopped due to the difficulty of printing. The machines and type of the Xin Xuzhou were looted by the enemy and puppets, and it is unknown where they were transferred when they were taken over, so they could not be restored. There are two newly added newspapers, Zhengyi Zhongbao, whose views are fair and appropriate, but their criticism of local issues seems to be still too little, perhaps due to the limitations of timeliness and environment. I remember when I passed through Zhenjiang, I talked to local people in the province about the cultural construction of Xuzhou. Liu Xuzhou, the secretary-general of the Provincial Council, called for the establishment of a central local public opinion. Truly, what kind of construction does the new Xuzhou need? The material may be pending for the moment, but the spiritual is really imminent!

### Dynamics in Suiyuan and Mongolia

— Correspondent Liu Yingyuan, Guisui

Comprehensive Report on the Situation of Various Banners

Since the delegation of Mongol Banners celebrating victory and returning to the capital to pay respects to Nanjing left Guisui, the recent situation of the Eighteen Mongol Banners in Suiyuan and Mongolia has been very quiet. The Sheritu Zhao, where Mongolians gathered in Guisui, is also much quieter than before. Recently, in the Ulanqab League, except for several conflicts between the Communist army's incorporated puppet Mongolian army of Ulijile's department and the Suiyuan Security Division of E You-san's department on the Chahar-Suiyuan border, other places are still relatively quiet. However, the covert activities of certain plainclothes armed personnel near Bailingmiao have made Sonam Chokjur, the Jasak of the Siziwang Banner, afraid to live in the Wangfu (prince's residence). He secretly returned to the banner for more than a week and then hurriedly returned to Guisui.

Among the three Urad Banners, the West Gong Banner is the most troublesome. Queen Yizhunfeng recently incorporated several Bao (units of 100 households) of Han people from the Baotou County into the Banner government and arbitrarily printed people's symbols. Landlords in the Zhongtan area are actively purchasing guns and establishing local defense teams to protect themselves. Among the seven banners of the Ikjoo League, Qi Quanxi, the Western Assistant of the Junwang Banner, is representing Prince Tu in Baotou, busy taking over the puppet Ikjoo League Office. Wang Pengcheng, the Western Assistant of the Darat Banner, has not been released from prison due to the murder of the Han Chinese Wang Sanjie case. Qi Yushan, the acting Jasak of the Uxin Banner, accompanied the young Prince Qi Shiying to visit Commander Fu before returning to the banner. Qi Sicheng, the security commander of the Otok Banner, came to Suiyuan, but has not returned for more than a month. Under the leadership of the two old-fashioned princes, Prince A and Beizi E, the Anti-Jin Banner and the Jasak Banner are like stagnant water without ripples.

Glimpses of Political Affairs in the Jungar Banner

Since the assassination of the dictator Qi Wenying in the Jungar Banner, and because the Jasak Qi Zhiguo died young without heirs, a post-mortem reorganization committee similar to a joint government has been established to preside over political affairs. The committee consists of seven members, including representatives from various factions, and one Han Chinese member. For the time being, they are getting along peacefully. No one dares to guarantee what will happen in the future. Young people from the Tumet Banner who went to Jining seeking new stimulation have disappeared. According to those who returned disappointed, it is easy to enter the "liberated area" but difficult to leave. The four Eastern Banners are all under the control of the Communist army, and the liquidation policy has driven many people to Suiyuan. The Mongolian refugees are being generously relieved by the provincial government. Because they miss their farmland and pastures, they are also calling for an armed return home. At 8:00 p.m. on the 20th of last month, Commander Fu convened the heads of relevant agencies in the heavy rain to hold a temporary Mongolian affairs meeting. It is heard that the main topics discussed were supporting the Mongolian Banners and stabilizing the Mongolian Banners, as well as studying plans for governing Mongolia. It is said that a public notice will be announced on this matter soon.

Farmland in Seven Counties West of Suiyuan is Flooded

In recent years, the population in various parts of the Northwest has increased, and afforestation movements have been widely launched in Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Suiyuan. Therefore, the desert climate has gradually improved. Winters are not as harsh as before the war, and summer rainfall is more abundant than in previous years. According to the Suiyuan Water Conservancy Bureau, the water level of the Yellow River has increased by 2.20 meters during the "fu shui" period, causing the canals in the Hetao area to overflow. The Yellow River near Baotou and Dengkou is overflowing its banks, less than four zhang from the railway. As of now, more than 100,000 mu of farmland in the seven counties west of Suiyuan has been flooded. It is heard that when the autumn floods arrive, the situation will be even more rampant. At the end of the summer and beginning of the autumn of the thirty-second year of the Republic, the Yellow River overflowed its banks in the Hetao area. Fortunately, the garrison troops assisted the people in preventing and blocking it, and no major disaster occurred. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, most of the 70,000 troops in the Hetao area were transferred east, and many strong men joined the army and left their hometowns.

Garrison Troops are Deployed to Challenge the Water

Currently, party and government personnel in the Hetao area are leading the elderly, weak, women, and children day and night to prevent and block the floods. At night, the canals are filled with red and green lanterns. Commander Fu has ordered all the defending troops of the × division stationed in the Hetao area to mobilize and fight the water. Recently, the summer crops have been harvested. If the water level in the upper reaches continues to rise, 70% to 80% of the autumn crops may be corrupted by the overflowing water. In addition, on the 11th of last month, thick clouds gathered in the north, and it rained continuously for nine days. It only cleared up on the 21st. Most of the summer crops that had not yet been harvested were moldy in the rain. 20% to 30% of the yellow earth houses where villagers lived were collapsed by the heavy rain, and there were incidents of people being crushed and injured. Many bridges on the west section of the Pingyuan Road were washed away by mountain floods, which has slowed down traffic. Many livestock in the banners of Suiyuan and Mongolia are suffering from scabies due to the wet soil. The provincial government receives disaster reports every day like snowflakes, and has requested the central government to quickly allocate relief funds to alleviate the suffering of the border people who are suffering from both natural disasters and man-made calamities.

Let the Children Read

Editor: Since the victory, the Shanghai municipal government is striving to improve, but because the municipal treasury is strained, many places cannot meet the high expectations of the citizens. Especially the education problem has reached a very serious stage. During the enemy-puppet period, citizens were unwilling to let their children receive enslaved education, and even wasted several years of precious school age. Some have just returned from the Great Rear Area. Now they want to send their children to school, but there is no place to send them. Most schools, especially municipal primary schools, do not openly enroll students. Sending children to school is as difficult as finding a job.

A certain municipal primary school in Hongkou originally had twelve classrooms. This time, it held an entrance examination, and the results showed that more than 1,700 people applied. If the original old students are included in the statistics, these students need to open up to fifty classes to accommodate them.

In theory, primary school is national education. Citizens have the obligation to complete primary school education, and it can also be said to be a right of taxpayers. They have the right to demand that the government provide their children with the opportunity to receive primary school education. School authorities should distinguish between high and low grades in the grades to be enrolled, regardless of the level of the students who want to study, no matter how many people there are, and cannot refuse to accept them.

However, because there is no way to obtain educational funds, we feel that the education problem has reached a very serious stage.

But, has the city government tried its best?

Of course, the few primary schools exemplified above have their special reasons. Because the Hongkou District was originally inhabited by Japanese residents. After the Japanese residents evacuated, the population is increasing rapidly. Moreover, there are only two municipal primary schools in that district. In particular, the fact that other districts' primary schools are not enrolling students is also an important reason for the surge in the number of candidates in that primary school. These are all special factors, and there are only two ways to solve them: either open several other primary schools in this district, or let this primary school use its original school site to provide as much school equipment as possible and expand the number of classes as much as possible. On the one hand, all schools should be expanded and dispersed in an all-round way in order to be solved, otherwise many school-age children will have no place to enroll.

In general, because the city government's finances are strained, there is no way to provide expansion funds for education. Moreover, fearing that citizens will increase their burden, schools are not allowed to raise funds on their own. Therefore, the managers of all levels of schools dare not make expansion plans. Private schools are also strictly managed, and people who are enthusiastic about education dare not try to start a business.

For this kind of reality, if we want to solve the problem, we dare not make too high-sounding arguments, for example, to ask people who are enthusiastic about education to donate money to schools voluntarily, or to ask the managers of various schools to understand the importance of education and not to be too concerned about the issue of funding. To be honest, in this society, under today's economic conditions, without a proper solution, no one has the power to solve this huge problem alone. To allow the education business to remain high-minded, without seeking a solution from the funding issue, will only lead the education business to its death.

We believe that there are several ways that may solve this serious problem:

(1) If municipal schools still have room for expansion, they should be helped to expand as much as possible. If it is impossible to provide equipment costs, parents of students may be allowed to raise funds. The city government will still provide regular expenses. In this way, according to the current situation, the burden on each parent will not be more than 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per semester. Although it is not as good as free education, it seems slightly better than being turned away. Many parents are willing to do this as long as their children have books to read.

(2) The municipal government should submit a petition to the Executive Yuan to order the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to provide low-interest loans for education, whether it is municipal or private, whether it is a newly established or existing school. If the Education Bureau believes that there is a real need for expansion, it can borrow funds from the four United Banks for establishment or expansion with the guarantee of the municipal government and strict management by the Education Bureau. This loan will be repaid by the municipal schools when the city government's finances improve. In private schools, it will be repaid in installments over several semesters.

(3) When allocating enemy and puppet houses in various regions, the municipal government should pay more attention to education, and should not focus too much on university school buildings. Especially in enemy-occupied areas, school buildings for primary and secondary schools should be reserved.

(4) Instead of allocating funds to provide relief for those who have dropped out of school, it is better to use this money to rescue children who are about to lose their school age.

In short, children cannot be left without books to read; we must think of ways in the absence of ways. (Ding Lifan)

### A Scene of Broadcast Debate on U.S. Policy Toward China Held in Springfield, Massachusetts

— Airmail dispatch from New York, July 31, by Wei Fan

In any case, the aid we give to the Central Government of China should not be used to incite civil war. All the efforts we make now and in the future are to promote a unified China.

(Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the U.S. State Department)

Recently, after the Anping Incident, U.S. Congressman Marcantonio of the left wing loudly advocated "U.S. troops should immediately withdraw from China and stop aiding China." This did not surprise most people, as he had long held this view. What is worth reporting to the countrymen is that in May or June, before the ceasefire order in the Northeast was issued, a broadcast debate on U.S. policy toward China was held in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. Besides Congressman Marcantonio, those who participated included Congressman Judd and Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department. From this debate, one can get a glimpse of the attitude of the U.S. government and the public. Butterworth said: The United States is committed to helping China achieve peaceful unification, which is a realistic policy. Congressman Judd said that the situation in Northeast China is now extremely complicated and may endanger world peace. If agreed by all parties, the United Nations could temporarily take over the administration of Northeast China until China is truly unified domestically. A world war occurred in Northeast China, and the region is now a dangerous powder keg. Marcantonio's speech reflected the opinions of the left wing and repeated the old tune of attacks habitually made by communists. He accused the Chinese government of failing to comply with the agreement to establish a coalition government. Judd and Marcantonio held different opinions on the cause of the current crisis in Northeast China and refused to yield to each other. Judd believed that the turmoil in China should be mainly attributed to the planning activities of the Communist Party, while Marcantonio said that the Central Government of China had failed to comply with the regulations. However, they all agreed that from the perspective of U.S. security and world peace, China's unification is indeed necessary, and Marshal Marshall's efforts in this regard should be trusted and supported. Butterworth summarized the State Department's views, believing that the United States' commitment to helping China achieve peace and unification is not a selfish act, but to promote international interests. Because of China's failure to unite, Japan was able to launch its aggression in 1931, and the United States' participation in the all-out war in 1941 was also directly caused by this. Congressman Judd correctly pointed out: We must support China's independence and the integrity of its territory and sovereignty, but we can no longer completely rely on the principles of the self-restrained Open Door and the Nine-Power Treaty. We must actively strive to bring about the emergence of a strong and unified China. The question today is not whether our efforts can achieve a perfect unification of China in the short term, but whether we can allow ourselves to abandon or change the direction of this effort to promote China's unification in the face of obvious difficulties. The policy proposed by Marshal Marshall is to achieve China's unification by peaceful means. Any other way beyond this policy, in my (Judd speaking) view, is to fully support the Chinese government, hoping to achieve unification by force. However, this has the possibility of creating the following unpleasant fact: China will be divided into two hostile camps, and any constructive policy in the Far East will therefore be seriously affected. In conclusion, Butterworth stated: "I deeply feel that while avoiding being drawn into Chinese partisan politics, we should continue to give Marshal Marshall trust and support to help him carry out the important task he is shouldering concerning the long-term interests of the United States, China, and international peace." In this broadcast debate, the most noteworthy thing was the attitude of Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department. It is said that after collecting and reviewing the opinions of various newspapers, the U.S. State Department firmly believes that almost all parties in the United States support President Truman's statement on China policy and also admire Marshal Marshall's approach to handling the "tricky" China issue. When asked if the opportunity for China to achieve domestic unification would be undermined if the Soviet Union supported the Communist Party while the United States supported the Central Government, Butterworth replied: Being undermined would be a minor matter. However, our policy is to consult with the Central Government of China, because the Central Government is the Chinese government recognized by all parties, and it is not only we who are only assisting the Central Government of China, but the Soviet Union's official policy is also the same. This can be seen from the alliance treaty signed between the Central Government and the Soviet Union last August. However, in any case, the aid we give to the Central Government of China should not be used to incite civil war. All the efforts we make now and in the future are to promote a unified China. We definitely do not want China's situation to be affected by external forces from both sides. For this reason, Secretary of State Byrnes held on to this concept at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference last December and reached an agreement with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Minister Bevin to issue a declaration stating that "China must become a unified and democratic China under the National Government, with broad participation of all democratic elements in all departments of the National Government, and stop domestic conflicts." Butterworth continued: "The most urgent task for the Chinese National Government is to formulate an agricultural reform plan to improve the people's livelihood, so as to prove that its government is indeed governed for the people." The reporter believes that Director Butterworth's remarks should be valued by all parties in our country. If the U.S. policy toward China is reviewed in the future, how will it evolve? I am afraid it still cannot go beyond this scope.

### The Heat Wave in Changchun

— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao from Shenyang Airmail Dispatch, this newspaper, 2nd

The heat wave has blown into Changchun, and Changchun is sweltering in the summer heat! On Zhongshan Road (formerly known as Central Avenue) in Changchun, the big trees shade the street, blocking the rocket-like sunlight and giving pedestrians great kindness. Several large squares and a few streets without trees flash with blue sky, scorching people. Although the streets are like this, the rooms are breezy, and it is even cooler in the evening, sometimes even feeling a little cold.

Most people's clothing is still white and blue cloth. Luan-colored Zhongshan suits and Western suits do not feel very shabby, because the weather is cool when it is cloudy and in the morning and evening. Red cloth short shirts and pants are still favored by women and young girls, and blue cloth is also common clothing, especially for the lower body.

Except for tall buildings, most of the residents in the urban area still live in low Japanese-style houses. Fortunately, the evenings are cool and not too sultry, and there are not many mosquitoes, so it is very comfortable to sleep. In the evening, there are few pedestrians on the street, and the habit of going to bed early and getting up early is still maintained here.

Good Business for Vehicles and Horses

Although some of the large buildings have been damaged, and there are also some bullet marks, the scars have not yet healed, but generally speaking, most of them can still be considered complete, which is much better than Shenyang.

The number of trams running can still barely meet the needs of citizens. On the main roads in the city, there is a burst of clattering hoofbeats; on Zhongshan Avenue, there is also a string of wheels rolling on the ground. The fare for horse carts starts at five yuan, and the tram is five yuan across the board?

The business of several large shopping malls and stores on Huoma Road in the city is still good. General daily necessities can be said to be readily available. Opening hours in the morning are mostly at eight or nine o'clock, and they close at seven o'clock in the afternoon.

On Wuma Road, the streets are lined with vendors hawking miscellaneous Japanese goods. They buy them cheaply and sell them at high prices, making a lot of profit in an instant, so many are doing this kind of business, similar to the scene on Hongkou Qujiang Road in Shanghai.

Japanese Who Have Not Left

The Japanese expatriates in Changchun have begun to evacuate. More than a dozen iron sheds at the South Station are filled with Japanese men and women expatriates preparing to board the train. Mouyu is also making plans to return home. According to a survey, the total number of Japanese expatriate prisoners in Changchun is 230,000, and more than 50,000 have already been evacuated.

On the road from "Eirakucho" in the south to "Yoshinocho" in the north, eight or nine out of ten are places where Japanese expatriates sell clothing. This is almost exactly the same as "Kasugacho" and "Aobacho" in Shenyang. Shenyang takes "Kasugacho" as the center, and Changchun takes "Yoshinocho" as the focus. Our compatriots are also mixed in the long streets, doing business inside.

Dancing is banned in Shenyang, but dance halls in Changchun still exist. The beautiful music of the band is sent outdoors through loudspeakers, and inside there are many people and Japanese dancing girls dancing the "Beng Cha Beng" steps. A dance ticket circulation coupon is five yuan, and sitting at a table for half an hour is one hundred yuan. The "Zhijiang" Dance Hall is one of them, but soldiers are not welcome. If they enter, someone will pat them on the shoulder and persuade them to leave.

On the afternoons of the 14th and 15th, the Japanese expatriate prisoners in Changchun gathered their excellent singers and dancers and held a meeting at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall to慰劳 the National Army. The music, lights, dance, and singing were all very good. Among the Chinese pop songs sung, there were "When Will You Come Again" and "Roses Bloom Everywhere." The Japanese girls who sang wore brightly colored and well-fitting cheongsams, singing beautiful Chinese lyrics with expressions and light dances, making our brothers enthusiastic, and applause filled the sky. These smiles and sounds had been presented to different people over the past ten months.

Leap Forward in Propaganda

The press in Changchun has published in a competitive manner. As of now, there are nine newspapers: "Central Daily News," "Forward Daily News," "New Life Daily News," "Huasheng Daily News," "Jilin Daily News," "Xiangchao Daily News," "Construction Daily News," "Northeast People's News," and "Minsheng Morning News." In addition, there are Japanese versions of "Northeast Guide," "National New Newspaper," and the Japanese version of "Forward Daily News." Each newspaper is almost equipped with excellent printing conditions. In order to maximize the effectiveness of propaganda, many newspapers include books and newspapers as supplements.

There are approximately eight enemy-puppet cinemas, all of which were taken over by the Changchun Office of the Northeast Special Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department. The films being shown are produced in Shanghai, but most of them are outdated. Among them, the most produced by the puppet Manchukuo "Man'ei." There are also quite a few Japanese films. These are allowed to be screened after inspection. According to Mr. Pan Gongbi, the special commissioner: "The constructive films made by puppet Manchukuo and Japan can be temporarily used by changing the explanations to maintain the current situation of the film industry. When new films from the Central Film Studio arrive in the future, the audience's tastes can be changed."

All cinemas are now controlled by the Changchun Office of the Northeast Special Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department. Film merchants operate on a lease-for-rent basis. It is said that the Changchun's largest Zhongshan Hall Theater will also be handed over by the Three People's Principles Youth League soon to the Changchun Office of the Northeast Special Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department for reasonable use.

It is said that the Cultural Movement Committee has also started working in Changchun and should have some performance. Mayor Zhao Junmai said: "Changchun's printing conditions are superior to other parts of the Northeast, and the general cultural level is also very high. I hope everyone can make good use of these superior conditions."

The Deserted Puppet Palace

The puppet palace is deserted. Not only are there few horses in front of the gate, but the main gate is also locked. When the reporter passed by the gate of the "Palace Affairs Department" by car, the yellow glazed tiles on the roof of the building reflected a dim light. Outside the palace gate, overgrown with weeds, a team of soldiers was drilling. Inside the palace courtyard, two or three soldiers walked to the side. Besides the guards with guns on the right side, there was nothing else.

Although Changchun cannot be spring forever, the current summer is still beautiful and tranquil. I pray that the bleak scene will not come.

### The Clouds Over the Provisional Capital

— Qing Shi, airmail dispatch from Chongqing, 3rd

During the peak of summer in Chongqing, the entire society seems to have fallen into a state of boredom. Let's talk about the merchants first! The wisdom of the merchants here is not necessarily weaker than that of the merchants "under the feet" (Chongqing people call people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang "under the feet," they also know how to make money, and compete to do speculative business.

A Landslide of Foreign Goods

Glassware floods the market. The appetite of imported foreign goods merchants is bigger than that of the Shanghai merchants. The brands of "glass" and "atomic" can be heard everywhere, and there is almost a feeling that there is no market if one is missing. Merchants are all smart and quick-witted. Sometimes, a fashionable item arrives at the same time. Because the outlet is narrow, it forms a stagnant state. Take the American glass comb as an example. It was sold for three thousand yuan each two months ago… and it was only available in luxurious department stores… Later, it was only sold for one thousand five hundred yuan each, and recently it has fallen to one thousand yuan. Other foreign goods are also the same. The most unlucky ones are the small merchants and street vendors. They use capital borrowed at high interest rates to operate foreign goods. At first, there was a little hope, but now it is frozen, and everyone is complaining. Big businesses will not be damaged. They are well-informed. If this business is not good, they will try another one. Anyway, they have a lot of money and can turn around easily. They always win a few. So in this society, the rich get richer, and the poor, no matter how hard they work, are still poor. "Big money makes small money" is absolutely correct.

The arrival of foreign goods is like a landslide. It is impossible for the small and medium-sized factories in our country, which are economically poor, to block this pit. Labor strikes are raging: layoffs, closures, and downsizing are heard every day. According to statistics, more than 360 factories have been sacrificed in these disputes. Now, those who can barely maintain are either those with extremely large financial resources, those with official capital participating, or those with some special forces to protect them. These struggling manufacturers could not withstand the invasion of foreign goods a month ago and once called for help… what about advocating the use of domestic goods… Despite shouting their throats out, they did not get a single sympathetic response. As a result, they changed their careers and speculated. Factories were closed and another business was started. The machines were like dead people in coffins, and no one asked about them. The word "production" has gradually disappeared from the mouths of manufacturers. Everything is left to fate, allowing the wind and rain to invade at will.

Construction of the Provisional Capital Remains a Slogan

When the government left Chongqing, there was a slogan "Build the Provisional Capital." Under this slogan with historical significance, the officials of the municipal government and the municipal council were busy, holding meetings, discussing, planning, and everything was perfect, building sewer projects, the two-river bridge, new-style roads, and trolleybuses! A provisional capital is really like a beautifully painted picture, and the citizens are happy to hear it! But after saying it for a few months and publishing it in the newspaper countless times, the funding is still at a loss, and it is only "talking on paper." Not only has this great plan not been realized, but even the original civilization has gradually degenerated! In the past, electricity was cut off regularly in different areas. Although some areas were temporarily dark, most areas were bright. Because the power outage was scheduled, the citizens had already prepared candles, so it did not affect nighttime work. Now, however, the power is cut off at any time, everywhere, and the darkness is unpredictable, making the general public laugh and cry, and causing considerable losses. Tap water is also often cut off, causing the coolies who make a living by carrying water to gather and fight for water, and the price of water has skyrocketed. Speaking of the story of public buses, it is really something that people "under the feet" have never heard of. The buses are aging items from seven or eight years ago. When the government had not yet returned to the capital, it promised to allocate one hundred new buses to replace them. Later, the supplies were "requisitioned" and emptied, and the official paperwork took time, so it has not been cashed in. After the government returned to the capital, this city, which is ornamental and almost historical, has gradually been forgotten by people.

Mountains of Garbage and Overflowing Sewage

The public buses here are more "scientific" than those in Shanghai. Its tail will emit smoke, which smells bad and is unbearable. Every time it drives into the street, it either drags a straight line of smoke or rotates like a gray-black rolling dragon with the wind. Unfortunately, people are afraid to see it, and no one goes to appreciate its posture. The garbage here is famous throughout the country. In some places, it is piled up like mountains. The collapse of garbage on a branch road in the southern district caused an unprecedented tragedy, killing nine residents. At that time, the newspapers exposed the incident, and the police局 was once tense and carried out cleaning work, but afterwards, it became deserted and no one cared about it. In secluded alleys and cold streets, garbage and urine can be seen everywhere. When the sun comes out, it smells pungent. Every time there is a heavy rain, the sewage overflows, making it impossible for people to set foot. If you pay a little attention to the streets when you walk, you can find dead rats everywhere. From morning to night, no one cleans them, so the prevalence of diseases in summer cannot be said to be a factor. People living in the provisional capital seem to be used to it and don't think it's strange, and no one suggests it to the health bureau, so those in charge of cleaning agencies seem to be happy to take it easy and not care.

Dance Halls Forge Ahead

Everything has not progressed, but we cannot deny that dance halls have made progress in forging ahead. There are seven large and small dance halls here: Sino-American Night Garden, International Chongqing Club, Allies, Yangtze River, and one that has not yet opened. Each dance hall is improving its decoration in order to compete for business. It is luxurious, comfortable, and men and women are fascinated by it, creating a lot of social scandals. The government authorities have wanted to accept the public's suggestion to ban dancing several times, but they are reluctant to give up the huge tax revenue, so the word "ban dancing" is only a slogan. In fact, apart from dance halls, there is no essence to discuss in the civilization construction of the provisional capital. Recently, general business people have paid attention to hotels and restaurants, so they have successively built new-style hotels and restaurants, such as the Queen Hotel, Dahua Hotel, Huixian Building, Yongnianchun Hotel, and Standard Hotel, all of which have hundreds of millions of yuan of capital. There are still several under construction that have not been included. Currently, a single room costs 11,000 yuan, which is already a surprising price here, but "Shanghai customers" say that it is only one-third of the price in Shanghai, and they still call it cheap. It can be seen that there is no absolute expensiveness or absolute cheapness in this world. All the standards of expensive comfort depend on comparison and the evaluation of a few people.

Disappointment with Repatriation Transport

Speaking of repatriation transport, it is really disappointing. The government itself has not changed, saying that party, government, and military agencies can complete their repatriation within a limited time, and ordinary people certainly do not need to talk about it. A batch was indeed repatriated in the first phase, far before the government returned to the capital. In the second phase, in order to urgently relieve the disaster in Hunan and Hubei, all ships were transferred to transport grain. In the third phase, the military situation was tight, so the ships were transferred to military transport, and the number of planes was also reduced. Now it is the third phase, and there are still more than 300,000 people waiting for repatriation here. Reading the newspaper last month was also just this number, which shows that it has not decreased. With fewer repatriation ships, black market transactions have increased. The black market price for direct transport from Chongqing to Nanjing is 500,000 yuan. The price for planes varies depending on the urgency, with some at 1.5 million, some at 1 million, and the lowest at 560,000 yuan. Rich people come and go without stopping, so there is no difficulty. Those who are suffering cannot help but shout difficulties to the sky. The small civil servants and righteous people waiting for repatriation ships are constantly living a life of hunger and destitution. The urban area is very large, and people sitting in the room or those who have not personally experienced it will not understand or see their groans and sorrows.

Gloom Envelops Deformed Changes

Doesn't the public opinion know this? Even if you know, what is the use of saying a few cool words in the newspaper? What's more, people's hearts are now suddenly evil and everyone is afraid of things. Speaking of the press, the reporter can't help but feel ashamed because he is also one of them. The newspapers here rarely say a word for the people.

Everything in the provisional capital is changing in a deformed way. After the government returned to the capital, this sacred land, this great command platform, seemed to be shrouded in gloom. I hope that distant light will come to illuminate her, but "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire," and this hope will inevitably disappear in the dimness!

### Black Rice and White Rice in Xi'an

— Special Correspondent Li Chi, Xi'an Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 5th

A police statistical report illustrates the social aspect of crime in Xi'an: In the first half of this year (January to the end of June), the city police bureau handled a total of 218 cases related to opium and drugs, involving 223 offenders. According to statistics released by the Shaanxi Provincial Security Command, during the same period, the department had adjudicated 245 similar cases within the city, sentencing 18 to death and a total of 174 to fixed-term or life imprisonment (the department adjudicated a total of 1,540 drug cases in outlying counties during the same period, sentencing 162 to death). Considering the statistics from the above two public security agencies, I cannot help but say that the thorough eradication of opium and drugs here is still a serious issue at present. At the same time, I firmly believe that the responsible authorities are determined to intensify enforcement, which explains the above figures. However, calculating the numbers, on average, one in every five hundred citizens is involved in drug cases within a year, which cannot help but be shocking and disheartening! The Shaanxi Provincial Anti-Opium Association and the Xi'an Municipal Branch have been established successively recently. Starting from the first day of next month, the branch will begin to implement rehabilitation work. For all those who are determined to quit drugs and apply on their own, the association will provide various conveniences. In addition, it can also provide relief to the families of those undergoing detoxification during the detoxification period, provide food and accommodation for the detoxifying persons themselves, and keep all secrets confidential. During the rehabilitation, if the person undergoing detoxification is reported by others, the association will also provide reasonable protection. This cannot be considered anything but a meritorious policy. It is said that Shaanxi Province has special difficulties in terms of the environment in implementing anti-opium policies, and the thorough solution to the problem may involve a scope beyond the sphere of anti-opium policy itself.

Everyone hopes to thoroughly eradicate the "black rice" of "opium addicts"; however, ordinary people hope that their "white rice" will be sufficient in quantity and lower in price. Unfortunately, the latter is contrary to expectations. Yesterday, the resident committee of the Provincial Assembly passed a temporary motion: "Recently, grain prices have been stable, and local flour prices have not increased, but various flour companies are suppressing the sale of their stockpiled flour, which is obviously hoarding, resulting in a sudden increase in the price of machine-milled flour, which has greatly stimulated general prices. It is proposed that the Provincial Government be consulted to investigate and deal with it quickly in order to calm the people..." Yesterday, the price of flour increased to 13,500 yuan per bag. Fortunately, the price of rice has remained stable after the increase. The Provincial Government recently sent a telegram to the special commissioner's offices and municipal governments of various districts, urging them to earnestly implement the grain price negotiation measures. The principle is to only allow legal grain merchants to operate grain and prohibit illegal merchants from concurrently engaging in the grain industry or hoarding for speculation.

"It is not easy to eat!" Standard salary for municipal teachers. This is "a drop in the bucket" for them, but for a person whose throat is parched and burning, there is nothing more precious than a cup of water. -- Water! The price per cart in Xi'an has recently increased from 190 yuan to 800 yuan; and one catty of flour can only be exchanged for two catties of charcoal!

The preparation for the Xi'an Municipal Waterworks seems to have been under consideration for a long time. Some people in the past assembly have also mentioned this matter, but due to the limited supply of equipment, it has been delayed. The recent concretization of preparations can be seen in the Provincial Government's passage of the proposal to establish a preparatory office for the waterworks. It is reported that the reason for revisiting this construction plan is that we have obtained more than a dozen sets of waterworks equipment from the U.S. military surplus materials. The Shaanxi Provincial authorities once went to Beijing to negotiate and were allocated one of them, which will be transported to Shaanxi and installed in Xi'an in the future. Insufficient lead wire pipes will be purchased separately. Equipment is no longer a problem, and the fundraising for capital is also not a problem.

This municipal project is also a "contribution" of the war: the roads in Xi'an are straight and long, and 80-90% of the intersections are perpendicular right-angled crosses. These three points already meet the standards of urban roads, but the road surface is poor, muddy and foot-sinking on rainy days, and yellow dust flies around on windy days. In order to improve the city's appearance and improve the road administration, the authorities have decided to allocate a large amount of asphalt from the Japanese military supplies received in Henan for the construction of asphalt roads in the city. When it is completed in the future, it may still be a pioneering undertaking in the northwestern cities. At present, the municipal government is starting to renovate fourteen roads, and tenders will be invited from merchants in the short term. Citizens are eager for these projects to be completed as soon as possible.

Starting from last night, the police strictly enforced nighttime measures. After midnight, any hawking or disturbing noises are prohibited on the streets, and residents without ID cards are prohibited from traveling on the streets after midnight to prevent the activities of unscrupulous elements. According to another report, some young children in the city have recently disappeared for no reason because illegal persons are designing to abduct and sell them. They have secretly set up institutions for trafficking in persons along the railway line. The authorities have paid close attention to this and will strive to protect the safety of citizens.

### Reader Replies: Legal Inquiries

(1) Fei Wuji asks: Dear Editor, when I was studying in junior high school in my early years, I met female classmate B. The two were deeply in love, so they made an oral agreement to marry each other. Unexpectedly, the enemy invaded our hometown. Out of a strong sense of patriotism, I engaged in the war of resistance underground. When victory came, my mother betrothed Miss C to me without my consent since I was over twenty years old. Unexpectedly, two weeks later, female classmate B, who had been separated for four years, returned from the interior. After meeting, they both remembered the past and wanted to renew their marriage vows, but they were both already engaged at this time, and they were both adults, so they felt unresolved resentment. (2) If both parties request each other to terminate the engagement, if the other party does not agree to terminate it, can they automatically publish a notice in the newspaper to terminate it? (3) Is there any violation of the law? (4) If we get married with the consent of our parents, is there any violation of the law? (5) Do the other parties have the right to interfere and prosecute our engagement and marriage? (6) What other legal methods can be used to terminate it?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies] The six points mentioned in the letter are not clear and concise, so it is difficult to answer them separately in order. The following is a general answer: Marriage is the most important event in life and cannot be regarded as child's play. Although Article 972 of the Civil Code stipulates that it should be decided by the male and female parties themselves, it should not be like changing one's mind in the morning and evening, going back on one's words, arbitrarily engaging, and arbitrarily breaking off the engagement. This is not only contrary to ethics but also harmful to customs. Now that both parties (referring to Fei Jun and Miss B) are engaged to another person, they must first negotiate with the other party who has engaged to them and agree to terminate the engagement before both parties can re-engage. And they must pay considerable compensation to the non-negligent party. This damage is not limited to property damage. If the other party does not agree, (2) A loyal reader of this newspaper asks: A had a family. At the end of 1943, he met B (a prostitute), had a relationship with her, and then cohabited. A issued a letter of guarantee (without witnesses), stating that he would bear B's living expenses in exchange for B not returning to prostitution; otherwise, A could unconditionally break off the relationship with her, etc. In the spring of 1945, A saw B walking with another man, C, and learned that B was indeed having an affair, so he orally declared the termination of the cohabitation relationship to B's mother and B. B is still secretly engaged in prostitution. The other day, she suddenly asked someone to go to A's place to negotiate and demand compensation for losses. Now there are four questions. Please ask your lawyer to answer them: (1) If B sues in court, is this letter of guarantee valid? (2) If B sues A for abandonment in court and asks A for living expenses, is this crime established? Does A still have the obligation to pay living expenses? (If) If B makes a scene at A's place of service, what methods can be used to sanction her? (4) Can A's wife sue B in court for the crime of interfering with the family?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies] (1) If conclusive evidence can be obtained to prove that B is still secretly working as a prostitute, it is B who has destroyed the letter of guarantee herself, and A can no longer be bound by the letter of guarantee. (2) The crime of abandonment is not established. If B's behavior is as described in the previous paragraph, then A has no obligation to pay living expenses. (3) The method of sanctioning depends on the consequences of B's making a scene. (4) If A's wife did not know the truth beforehand and only now knows that B is having an affair with A and has obtained evidence of the adultery, she can sue B in court for the crime of interfering with the family.

### Rejuvenating the Sericulture Industry in Guangdong

— He Zhiduan

(Continued)

Unfortunately, it was lost in the period when the West River was once occupied by the enemy. Therefore, the establishment of silkworm seed farms in our province is urgently needed. If cold storage is not easy to purchase immediately, the address of the seed production farm should be selected in a place with wind tunnels or caves, which are sufficient to naturally refrigerate the silkworm seeds to solve the current difficulty of lacking refrigeration equipment. In the past, farmers were limited by old habits and were not easy to accept the promotion of improved seeds. Now the situation is particularly special and seeds are scarce. Promoting improvements at this time can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

The places that should be added in the second phase: (1) Sericulture Guidance Office, to guide farmers in mulberry cultivation, silkworm rearing, silk reeling, silk business and raw silk trade, to organize young silkworm rearing rooms, public cocoon drying rooms, silk reeling cooperatives, raw silk transportation and sales cooperatives, and silk weaving cooperatives; (2) Silkworm Seed Elimination Office, to eliminate irregular seed producers and indiscriminately produce silkworm seeds, (3) Raw Silk Public Warehouse. In addition, regarding raw silk inspection institutions, the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for this, so there is no need to add another one. The places that must be added in the third phase: (1) Sericulture Vocational School, to train practical middle and lower-level talents; (2) Sericulture Children's School, to train the children of sericulture practitioners to develop the next generation of sericulture backbone; (3) Silk Testing Farm, to engage in sericulture testing and research in the province to seek improvement.

4. Recruitment of Talents

The sources of sericulture talents in this province are as follows: (1) Graduates of the Sericulture Department of the Agricultural College of Sun Yat-sen University, totaling less than 40 people; (2) Provincial Zhongkai Agricultural School, each session of the Sericulture Department has a minimum of 10 graduates and a maximum of no more than 20 graduates. Up to now, there have been a total of 16 sessions, totaling less than 250 people; (3) Shunde Agricultural Vocational School, which has now been discontinued. The Sericulture Department of that school had only three sessions of graduates, totaling less than 50 people. This refers to the middle-level cadres of sericulture in this province. Secondly, there are sericulture training classes at the Agricultural College of Sun Yat-sen University and sericulture training classes at the Agricultural College of Lingnan University, which have now been discontinued. The number of technicians trained is not large. As for the specialized talents for upper-level leadership, there are only a few professors in the Sericulture Department of the Agricultural College of Sun Yat-sen University. It can be seen that the sericulture talents in this province are poor! Reflecting on the current situation, these specialized and technical talents

Due to the war, the sericulture industry in this province has been left without a place to use their talents, or due to the low salaries during the war, they have changed their minds and cannot stick to their jobs. There are even those who are unemployed and wandering around. This situation should not be allowed to continue in today's restoration and construction of the country. To fix the fold after the sheep is lost, on the one hand, talent registration must be carried out so that those who have changed careers and those who are unemployed can make the best use of their talents in the work of revitalizing the sericulture industry in this province. However, in the near future of high-speed development, this small number of talents is not enough. Even if training is intensified, it cannot be achieved immediately, but the revival of the industry is an urgent task for the economic construction of this province. It cannot be abandoned due to insufficient talents. There are two methods for short-term solutions:

1. Borrowing sericulture talents from Japan. The development of sericulture in Japan is noteworthy. The climate in the southern counties, such as Okinawa, is similar to that of Guangdong Province. During our country's war of resistance, the sericulture industry in this province was plundered and destroyed by the Japanese enemy. It is reasonable to use their talents to start from scratch.

2. Supplementing the lack of sericulture talents with other specialized talents. Sericulture often has close connections with natural sciences or applied technologies. For example, those who study fruit trees, forests, and crops can be responsible for mulberry cultivation technology; those who study biology and insects can be responsible for silkworm rearing and seed production technology; those who study agricultural chemistry, industrial chemistry, mechanical engineering, and factory management can be responsible for silk reeling or raw silk inspection technology; those who study agricultural economics and industrial economics can be responsible for cocoon and silk trade or sericulture administration. Therefore, the talents for the revival of sericulture are not limited to graduates of agricultural colleges, and talents in law, engineering, science, and business can also be recruited and employed. Based on the above methods, there is no need to worry about the lack of talents. In addition, the fundamental solution should be the establishment of secondary agricultural vocational schools, the supplementation and enrichment of agricultural colleges, and the establishment of training classes attached to various sericulture farms.

5. Expansion of Sericulture Areas

The distribution areas of the sericulture industry in this province can be divided into several regions:

1. The main distribution areas in the central region are as follows: Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, Liangjiao, Shuiteng, Leliu, Lecong, Yingzhou, Lunjiao, Longjiang, Longshan in Shunde County, Guanshan, Xiqiao, Jiujiang, Zhou, Shiwan, Luocun, Shatou, He in Nanhai County, the third, eighth, and ninth districts of Zhongshan County, Poshan, Shuikou, Yuetang, Qichong, Gulao, Weidun, and Nineteen Forts in Heshan County, the southwest city of Sanshui County, and the northeast of Xinhui County.

2. The main distribution areas in the western region are as follows: Lubu, Xitun, Bagui, Dongtun, Anhuai, and Sundong in Gaoyao County, Sanxiang, Liucun, Luohong, Ping'an, Shengping, and the county seat in Deying County, Jiancheng, Baixia, Liyuan, Xianping, Xiba, Shangsi, Sining, and Ducheng in Yunnan County, Wuqiang, Duqi, Zeyuan, Cushi in Yunfu County, Fucheng, Xiaduan, Zhongyi, and the county seat in Fengchuan County, and Fucheng, Pingxi, and Ganping in Luoding County.

3. The main distribution areas in the northern region are Lechang County and Qingyuan County.

4. The main distribution area in the eastern region is Huiyang County.

5. The main distribution areas in the southern region are Maoming County and Xuwen County.

Looking at the original sericulture areas, the central region is the most prosperous, followed by the western region, and the eastern, northern, and southern regions are extremely undeveloped. The central region is the Pearl River Delta, with an area of approximately 20,000 square li. It is a river alluvial plain with convenient irrigation and fertile soil. It is used to plant mulberry, hemp, rice, and sugarcane. It is an important agricultural area in this province. Planting drought-resistant and flood-resistant mulberry trees in fertile soil seems a pity in terms of land use. Also, due to the low and humid terrain, the mulberry leaves contain a lot of water during the plum rain season, and the silkworms are weak and prone to disease. Therefore, the second, third, and fourth crops are not easy to make, and the silk quality is also poor and difficult to store for a long time. However, this area has always been the main sericulture area in this province. Local silkworm farmers have skilled technology, experience in farming that has been eliminated, and a simple material foundation. Therefore, it still has value for maintenance. The western region is the counties along the West River. The distribution of sericulture is limited to the banks of the West River. The soil is deep and suitable for mulberry cultivation. However, unfortunately, there are floods along the river every year from June to September, which makes the mulberry leaves easy to turn into mud, which requires more labor to use as feed. Also, when the silkworm season is in full swing, the silkworm rearing room must also be moved. This is its disadvantage. Sericulture in this area is still in its infancy and requires greater efforts to develop it. The sericulture areas that need to be expanded are the eastern, northern, and southern regions. The northeastern regions are mountainous and have no floods. In addition to the sloping land that is suitable for forests, the slightly sloping land is not suitable for cultivating intensive crops and is extremely suitable for mulberry cultivation. The southern region is a flat slope with no end in sight, covering an area of approximately 30,000 square li. The soil is deep, weathered, and transparent, and most of it has been abandoned. It is very suitable for mulberry cultivation. In summary, maintaining the Pearl River Delta sericulture area, developing the West River sericulture area, and opening up the East River, North River, and South Road sericulture areas are the current key tasks.

6. Conclusion

The revival of the sericulture industry depends on precise planning, perfect organization, and sufficient financial resources. However, sericulture workers must have a high degree of professionalism and a sense of responsibility, value the interests of the country, and not hesitate to sacrifice themselves! In order to improve work efficiency, they must not only have passive behaviors such as public service, law-abiding, and breaking away from bureaucracy, but also give full play to their active service to the country and the nation.

Economic construction after victory is the main task of nation-building in the future. The sericulture industry in this province has suffered deep wounds in the short term, and its relationship with economic construction in the future is also very close. Therefore, no one warmly hopes that the agricultural and forestry authorities of this province will have a new understanding of this cause, quickly launch it, and truly improve it to revive the sericulture industry in this province with a new, fast, and practical spirit.

In the past month, there have been several things that have satisfied and excited enthusiastic sericulture practitioners: (1) Mr. Zhang Yujiu, advisor of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Mr. Wang Longsheng, a specialist member, flew from Chongqing to Guangdong to discuss the revival of sericulture with the provincial authorities; (2) Chairman Luo instructed the organization of the Guangdong Construction Research Committee, which is divided into three groups: economic, political, and cultural. We expect that the study of silk industry construction in this province in the future will not be ignored in the economic group; (3) The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has been expanded and reorganized into the Agricultural and Forestry Office. The administrative organization has been expanded, so the effect of sericulture construction can also be enhanced; (4) The Guangzhou Commodity Inspection Bureau is about to start the inspection of exported raw silk, which will promote the improvement of raw silk quality internally and enhance international trade credit externally. We sincerely hope that after this prelude, there will be more active work to revive the sericulture industry in this province.

### An Outline of Industrial and Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

4.  Manufacturing

When a business organization is being organized, or after it is established, there should already be a plan for the goods to be produced. Many factories exist, some even using the name of the product as the factory name.

Therefore, the manufactured goods have a significant relationship with the organized business, because the goods determine the estimated annual turnover (market research referencing the sales of similar products), the type of factory and equipment needed, and the amount of capital required. These issues are important data for preparing a business plan. Many companies include a business plan when raising capital, so that investors believe there is great hope or potential profit in the future, and are happy to invest.

We are now going to discuss the issues that need to be considered at the beginning of the manufacturing process. These issues may already have been concretely planned when the business organization was started. Fortunately, everything is possible through human effort. As long as the various principles are known, they can be applied flexibly.

A. Product Design

Who is responsible for the design: Before manufacturing a product, the ideal product must be designed. Who is responsible for this design work varies depending on the business organization. If it is a manufacturing plant solely owned and operated by one person, then the owner can design it himself, or ask someone to design it, and then decide on it himself, which is the simplest. If it is a partnership or unlimited company, then it needs to be discussed by several people. If it is a limited company, and the manager has the power to handle it, then he will decide. If the board of directors attaches great importance to this aspect, then it should be discussed jointly by the board of directors. As a rule, the design of the goods greatly affects the sales of the goods, so the board of directors should carefully study and discuss it. Usually, the person in charge of production in a manufacturing plant is a factory manager, who is often an expert in the goods to be produced and released. Therefore, he can also competently design the goods.

Based on his knowledge, he can manufacture a perfect product, which will certainly be superior to the general products on the market. At the same time, the sales department responsible for promotion should also participate and provide opinions, because the person in charge of sales should be very familiar with the general situation of the market and the psychology of customers. He should contribute as much as possible for reference in the manufacturing aspect. Otherwise, if the factory managers only manufacture goods based on their knowledge, and they cannot be sold, it is equivalent to building a car behind closed doors.

Commercial competition is very fierce. For a business to exist and make a profit, it is necessary to manufacture goods seriously. Usually, before starting to manufacture milk powder, a milk powder manufacturer must buy all the milk powders on the market for reference, study their ingredients, effects, color, decoration, and price, and then formulate their own manufacturing standards, which will be jointly discussed and decided by the important figures in the company.

When deciding on the design of the goods, the following points should be considered:

A. Relationship to manufacturing: Each product has its own special needs. Some products require very complex machines, while others only require the use of labor. Even the same product can be made in several different ways, and the manufacturing costs of the different ways are different.

In order to obtain profits, a manufacturing plant should strive to reduce manufacturing costs. The most ideal thing is to use the lowest manufacturing cost to produce the highest standard of goods, because we want to reduce manufacturing costs without implementing a policy of cutting corners.

### What is Art

— Zheng Wuchang

What is art? It seems difficult to explain this question. Let's say an artist is like a silkworm. The silkworm eats mulberry leaves and, when the time is right, it can spin silk. An artist is like a bee. The bee collects flower nectar, and after considerable work, it can make honey. Silk is silk, honey is honey. You can't say that silk is made from mulberry leaves, or that honey is made from flower nectar. But you can't deny that the silkworm's spinning of silk is related to eating mulberry leaves. The bee's honey-making uses flower nectar as a raw material. The silkworm's spinning silk is the silkworm's art; silk is its work of art. The bee's honey-making is the bee's art; honey is its work of art. My use of silkworms, mulberry, honey to explain art is of course a very superficial and crude analogy. Human talent, coupled with long-term cultivation, results in artistic food that is by no means as simple and limited as silkworms, mulberry, and honey. Therefore, what is discovered in artistic creation is naturally ever-changing, brilliant, and complex, each according to the artist's innate talent and acquired cultivation, and each has its own discovery of beauty. Therefore, an artist observes, appreciates, comprehends, and uses ingenuity on everything in nature to express his own unique beauty, to transcend nature without losing the truth and ultimate principles of nature, is what counts as art. Even in copying and transcribing the works of the ancients, one must digest the old and transform it, showing one's own emotions and skills. If it is not like this, if one writes about nature but only seeks to be the same as nature, if one copies the ancients but only seeks to be the same as the ancients, whether it is nature or the ancients, one can never copy or transcribe it in the same way; even if one can, it is nothing but nature, nothing but the ancients, and there is no me. For example, if the silkworm eats mulberry leaves, it is still mulberry leaves; if the bee collects flower nectar, it is still flower nectar. Why bother with this extra effort? What's the point? Photography is the most mechanical way to write about nature, but the framing, lighting, intention... all differ according to each person's skills and emotions, and the resulting works are distinguished by beauty and ugliness. As for drama, sculpture, calligraphy, and painting, in particular, one must go beyond the image to grasp the essence, and promote one's own unique life as beauty. Therefore, works that are mechanically copied or printed without the author's life are not considered works of art. Imitating, following in the footsteps, repeating sounds, and never finding one's own way out are not considered art. The true meaning of art lies in independently creating in a new direction towards beauty. Artists each have their own universe of truth, beauty, and goodness, solemn and beautiful, relying on your wisdom and your efforts to travel with the Creator.

### Painting and Economics

— Yu Jianhua

The nature of painting and economics is not only completely different, but also very contradictory and mutually exclusive; but painting is not easy to sever ties with economics in any way, which seems to have a principle of mutual opposition and complementation.

It is commonly believed that painting is a noble art form, which should be very pure; painters are noble artists, who should be very noble, and should not haggle over every penny or be diligent for profit. Painters should paint for art, to express their own emotions and personal thoughts; they should not paint for a living, let alone work hard for money. In fact, among the countless painters throughout the ages, there are indeed a few who do not paint for money, for example:

(1) Emperors and nobles—at their leisure, they paint as they please. As rich emperors and nobles, they naturally do not need to exchange paintings for money.

(2) High officials and ministers—with light duties and a comfortable life, they use painting as a means of recreation.

(3) Wealthy merchants and gentry—owning vast lands and abundant jewels, they spend money lavishly and use painting as a means of attaching themselves to elegance.

(4) Poets and recluses—romantic and unrestrained, not engaged in production, aloof from the world, and never mentioning money, they use painting as a tool to express their feelings.

Of the above four types of people, the first three have money themselves and do not need to earn money by painting. The fourth type does not have money, but is naturally eccentric and does not like money. These people not only do not exchange paintings for money, but even if princes and nobles ask for them with money, they are even less willing to paint. On the contrary, if intimate friends or ordinary people ask for them casually, they are happy to paint. They do not care at all about their living needs. Apart from the above four types of painters and similar types, most painters cannot but rely on painting to maintain their livelihood. Relying on painting to maintain one's livelihood can also be divided into two types: wholesale and retail. For example, painters in the imperial court in past dynasties painted for the government for their whole lives, and received a monthly salary from the imperial court to make a living. It can be said to be a lifetime contract system. As for ordinary painters who sell paintings, they are all retail. They paint one painting for one purchase, and two paintings for two purchases. They are paid by the piece. "In leisure, I paint green hills, and do not let the world tarnish my heart." This is the self-expression of retail painters. "If you can't write a popular poem, then paint peonies." This is the painter's business strategy. In order to make a living, it is easy to lower the quality of one's paintings in order to cater to the customer's psychology. Now the imperial court has long been abolished, and the government has no spare money to support painters. Painters who make a living by painting only do retail. Retail can also be classified into types: one type is to create many works and hold exhibitions in order to sell them temporarily; the other type is to visit door to door selling one painting today and one painting tomorrow. Among these, the value of the works naturally varies greatly due to the quality of the works, the size of the reputation, and the amount of the price. However, they all make a living by selling paintings, and there are also many people who do not care much about the amount of remuneration, and still preserve a little romantic and refined nobility in maintaining their livelihood. Only those painters who haggle over every penny, are indifferent to their relatives, seek only profit, and have no feelings, who regard money as their life and books as goods, are really worse than merchants. It really makes people feel that "civilization has been swept away" and "elegance has been cut off."

Because painters cannot be separated from economics, the prosperity or decline of a country's economy has a great influence on the rise and fall of painting. Western countries such as Italy, France, England, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain all attach great importance to painting, and the lives of painters are generally not a problem. Once a painter becomes famous, not only do people in society buy his works, but also the government and museums compete to buy them.

Because painters cannot be separated from economics, they cannot be separated from the economic centers of cities. For example, Venice in ancient Italy, Paris in modern France, and London in England have become centers of Western painting. In China, when the economy follows politics, the capitals of past dynasties have become places where painting flourished and painters gathered. Beijing still has this phenomenon now. The most obvious place where the economy has developed independently and painting has followed is Yangzhou during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, and Shanghai since the late Qing Dynasty. Why are there so many painters in Shanghai now, like "crossing the river"? Although there are no accurate statistics, it is no exaggeration to estimate that painters in Shanghai account for half of the painters in the country! This is because Shanghai is the largest commercial port and the only economic center in China. There are many rich people, and there are many people who buy paintings. Naturally, painters "flock like water to a drain" to Shanghai.

Because Shanghai is the largest economic center in the country and the city with the largest population and area in the country, it is not only a place where "all talents gather," but also a place where "all merchants gather." All kinds of goods, whether new or old, Chinese or foreign, can be bought. When there are more talents, there are naturally opportunities for observation and competition; when there are more goods, there is naturally everything one needs. For example, in small cities in the interior, talents are naturally scarce and materials are scarce. Even in larger cities such as Jinan, Kaifeng, Nanchang, Fuzhou, and Xi'an, there are no more than five or six people who can paint well. There is often a shortage of paints and paper, and it is even more difficult to find oil paints and canvas for Western painting. In Shanghai, there are at least several hundred painters, and all the tools for painting, even silk for painting, can be said to be readily available, which provides great convenience for painters. People who live in Shanghai for a long time do not feel this way, but if you go to the interior, you will deeply feel it. During the Anti-Japanese War, I traveled in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian for seven years, and I asked everywhere for Chinese painting materials but never bought any.

Because there are many painters in Shanghai, there are also many exhibitions. There are many antique shops and many families who collect ancient paintings. Therefore, it is very convenient to see new paintings and old paintings in Shanghai, followed by Beijing. In the West, Paris in France can be said to be the center of world art. There are more painter exhibitions than in Shanghai, especially the various art academies, museums, galleries, and individual exhibition rooms of famous painters established by the public and private sectors, which bring together great writers of all ages. It is really dazzling and beautiful. The construction of such art academies and the purchase of famous paintings require huge economic capabilities. In China, only the Palace Museum in Beijing spent a lot of money transporting thousands of ancient paintings back and forth during the Anti-Japanese War, which cannot be borne by private individuals. Therefore, if you want painting to develop, economic strength is a major condition that cannot be ignored.

### Poetry in Painting, Painting in Poetry

— Jin Qijing

Some time ago, I went with Mr. Jiang Danshu to visit Mr. Xiao Wuquan. Mr. Xiao was Mr. Jiang's teacher, so I should call him Great Teacher. In his simple studio, I saw a very extraordinary couplet, which was Zheng Yuan's birthday couplet for Mr. Xiao: "There is poetry in painting, and there is calligraphy in poetry; there is no Dao outside of man, and there is no man outside of Dao." The sentences were natural and perfect, truly seamless, and gave me a deep impression at the time.

Su Dongpo once commented on Wang Wei, saying: "Mo Jie's paintings have poetry in them, and Mo Jie's poems have paintings in them." In fact, poetry in painting is not only true of Wang Wei, but also of many poets since the Tang and Song dynasties, who also have many famous lines that can be used for this. For example: "Green trees surround the village, and green mountains lean outside the city; A distant autumn sail on the Green Maple River, ancient trees sparse on the edge of White Emperor City; The mountain emerges from the wind and clouds, the sky slopes low at the end of the plains; The stream turns green, rolling the water on the flat dyke, the forest is missing, and green separates the mountains on the other shore." Which of these famous lines is not a painting? All poems that describe scenery must have a sense of painting.

As for painting in poetry, just look at more famous paintings from the Song and Yuan dynasties and experience them, and there are many examples that cannot be enumerated. For example: Dong Beiyuan's "Dragon Lodging in the Countryside", Xia Yuyu's "West Lake in Spring Dawn", Li Di's "Returning Home in Wind and Rain", Ma Qinshan's "Wine Cup and Bright Moon", Huang Shijiu's "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains", Wang Huanghe's "Spring Farming in the Valley", Ni Yunlin's "Rongxi Zhai Tu", Wu Zhonggui's "Fisherman", Mi Nangong's "Cloud Mountain", Leng Pengtou's "High Pavilion", Qiu Shizhou's "Waiting for Crossing in Autumn River", Tang Ziwei's "Pine Sounds on the Mountain Road", and many other famous works, which one does not have poetic meaning? However, most of the famous works after the Yuan Dynasty were inscribed by the authors themselves, who directly expressed the essence and poetic meaning of the paintings, creating a unity of poetry and painting. Otherwise, the paintings with poetry are more thought-provoking! When we look at Mr. Xiao's paintings, they are grand and magnificent, often capturing thousands of miles of the Yangtze River in a small space, as if they were Han Changli's articles, with endless charm, naturally worthy of the famous line "poetry in painting".

Mr. Xiao is over eighty years old this year and can be called the head of the contemporary painting world. The Qing Dynasty painting history of Youzheng Bookstore says of him: "He traces the Song and Yuan dynasties, and takes nature as his teacher." His landscapes are indeed vigorous and profound, opening up new paths. His disciples are all over the north and south, standing tall as a great master of the contemporary era. Ni Yunlin praised Wang Shuming, saying: "Wang Youcheng's brush is exquisite and his ink is wonderful, he calms his mind and lies down to tour the landscape, following Zong Shaowen. Shuming's brushstrokes can lift a tripod, and there has been no such person in five hundred years." In the five hundred years of Wang Shuming's era, which was the golden age of our country's painting, were there no painters who could compete with Wang Shuming? It can be seen that the ancient custom of friendship was very simple and sincere, and the praise of peers was like this. Therefore, Zheng Yuan's praise of Mr. Xiao was also an expression of this spirit. Mr. Xiao himself said in the preface to the second collection of his paintings, which was published ten years ago: "I have been learning to paint for more than fifty years, and I deeply know that this way is difficult to speak of." He has experienced fifty years of painting, and is still as humble as a valley, which is in line with the meaning of the old man Gengyan's saying: "I only understood the method of green and blue after fifty years," and there is a subtle similarity in their views. As the saying goes: "After learning, you know your inadequacy." Mr. Xiao's painting way does have the true meaning of the Buddhist saying "As a person drinks water, he knows whether it is cold or hot." It is definitely not comparable to the general academic paintings that are common nowadays. The famous line "There is no Dao outside of man, and there is no man outside of Dao" has long been deeply imprinted in my mind.

Hua Xinluo, a native of Fujian, is good at flowers and plants, and his landscapes are especially beautiful and vigorous. He lived in Hang County and died at home at the age of eighty. Xinluo's flowers and plants occupy an important position in the art world of the late Qing Dynasty, and are equal to Futang, Nantian, and Qingxiang. The right picture and the previous ones are all his masterpieces. Xu Bangda recognizes.

### Zheng Manqing in the Last Thirty Years

— Lou Xinkun

Manqing is a native of Yongjia. He was clever as a child, and the villagers regarded him as a child prodigy. He was known for his poetry, calligraphy, and painting at an early age, and it is appropriate that he was valued by the art world. It was the fifth year of the Republic of China when Manqing traveled to Hangzhou. I lived on the lake and had a previous connection with him. Living together day and night, I saw his paintings, which were interesting and profound. I admired his extraordinary talent and respected him as a close friend. I wanted to seek a long-term friendship, but Manqing returned east after living there for more than a year. In the autumn of the tenth year, he was re-hired by the Beijing Academy of Fine Arts and Yuwen University to teach poetry and painting. After several years, he returned to Shanghai and became the head of the Chinese painting department of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. From then on, his art became more refined, and he created naturally, and he was regarded as the leader of the Yongjia school. Wu Changshuo sighed that it was an absolute art, similar to Tianchi Xuege, and able to absorb its essence and remove its dross, which is truly no exaggeration. In the eighteenth year, the elders in Shanghai thought that the quintessence of the country was declining day by day, and that it would be useless if there were no talents as capable and experienced as Manqing to come forward to advocate for it. Therefore, they invited him to gather like-minded people and establish the Chinese Academy of Literature and Art. For a time, the rising stars all came from his school. Who knew that Manqing, in addition to the three perfections, devoted himself to studying the classics, and had been in the hall of Mr. Qian on famous mountains for many years. He also had a wide understanding of medicine and Tai Chi, and had a deep understanding of the profound principles, expressing what previous people had not said. In the twenty-sixth year, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Manqing moved west with the national army. After ten years of being praised, he suddenly returned, and he has never slackened in his work. The poet's inspiration is simple and unrestrained, making people look up to him. Why wait for tedious words? After the disaster, we meet again, and he presents dozens of fine works for the people of Shanghai to appreciate. What is his impact on the revival of art? I have described Manqing's simple history of the last thirty years in this way, which I hope will be pleasing to those who admire Manqing.

### The Early Movement of Opera

— Song Shouchang

Opera was born in Florence, northern Italy, at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries. At that time, the Renaissance was in full swing. Music was also inspired, and a group of poets and musicians who admired Greek art gathered at the mansion of Count Giovanni Bardi to engage in the revival movement of ancient Greek tragedies. They returned the complex counterpoint music of the Middle Ages to simplicity, abandoning counterpoint and trying harmony, imitating the form of popular music at the time, and adding harmonic accompaniment to the monophonic songs. Their earliest works were Dafne, created by Jacopo Peri (1561-1633), Rinoceini, and Ginlre Carcini (1550-1618), a short and poetic work. The subject matter was taken from mythical stories. "Dafne" was staged in Florence in 1597 and achieved considerable success, but it was still experimental and not performed publicly. The second work, Euricice, was performed publicly in 1600 to celebrate the wedding of Duke Henry IV, attracting general attention. The organization and form of this work were derived from the madrigals popular in the 16th century. Because madrigals were considered unsuitable for dialogues between characters in dramas, in addition to the old-style chorus, recitative and accompaniment of several instruments were added. From then on, the singer expressed emotions based on the natural tone of the language, without being restricted by music. This kind of song tune sounds like spoken language, but it is still melodic, and the effect of the opera is greatly enhanced.

After opera was produced in Florence, this new art movement influenced Venice, and Italian opera gradually developed. In Venice, Claudis Monterverdi (1567-1643) made the greatest contribution to opera. His works can be said to be the ancestor of modern music. He was a great genius musician who boldly applied dissonant sounds, expanded the orchestral structure in opera, and created the Tremolo of stringed instruments to enhance the effect of the drama. Regarding the expression of drama, he paid special attention to the fusion of music and drama, and used the timbre and characteristics of different instruments to describe as much as possible. His famous works include Orfeo, Ariannu, and Tancredi. These works are much more advanced than the first opera Dafne, using an orchestra of thirty-nine instruments for accompaniment, and its melody and harmony are very beautiful and expressive. Since the effect of stringed instruments was used in opera, orchestral beauty gradually progressed with the development of opera. From then on, instrumental music was not only used for accompaniment but also often played independently in the overture of the opera.

By the second half of the 17th century, the center of Italian opera moved from Venice to Naples in southern Italy. Opera underwent a reform movement, which was characterized by emphasizing the melodic beauty of the songs in the play. The leader of this school was Alessandro Scarlatti (1659-1725). He created an Italian-style overture and added it before the opening of the opera, using musical performances to hint at the content of the opera to be performed. This overture was composed of three musical movements: fast, slow, and fast. In terms of form, it is actually a pure instrumental music, and the symphony of later generations evolved from this form. He made special contributions to vocal music. He believed that the Florentine school of opera only focused on recitative and ignored melody, so he created an aria to remedy its shortcomings, and the melody of singing became more and more beautiful and lyrical.

Later, the Italian opera revival movement spread to other parts of the European continent, and France, England, Germany and other countries responded. Among them, the works created by Giouanni Lalli (1632-1684), the music director of the court of Louis XIV of France, were more prominent. He focused on the application of ballads and worked hard to harmonize the lyrics and music, and the French-style overture was also completed by him. A musical work was established using a slow movement, a fast fugue, and a dance finale.

In summary, the above is about the development of the Italian opera revival movement. The evolution of the forms of madrigals, recitatives, arias, and ballads, which are related to the long tones of the main music, has gradually developed the accompaniment of harmony. In terms of instrumental music, the creation of overtures has laid a foundation for the orchestra, and then the form has been expanded to establish pure instrumental music, which has influenced the generation of symphonies in the future. These developments in the form of the main music have given great help.

### Public Bidding

— Shaofu

Our city has a large number of enemy and puppet properties. It is said that the disposal bureau will publicly bid for them. However, there is a caveat, which is "except for those approved for valuation and transfer and those allocated by order." This caveat includes a lot of content. Let’s put it aside for now and talk about public bidding first.

Although the newspapers have not mentioned the housing shortage much recently, we know that the housing shortage in our city is still very serious, and it has not been resolved or alleviated just because it is not mentioned. The municipal authorities even have plans to allocate special funds to build citizen housing and to order landowners to build houses. This proves that Shanghai has not yet reached the state of "more houses than people."

However, it is really strange to say that although there are not more houses than people, in fact, the current situation of more houses than people has been created. How can this be said? It turns out that those who really need houses are unable to get houses, while a small number of wealthy people control a large number of houses and hoard them for speculation, talking about gold bars, US dollars, key money, deposit refunds, etc. On the one hand, they cannot afford gold bars and US dollars, so they have nowhere to live; on the other hand, it is not easy to get gold bars and US dollars, so the houses are left empty.

Today's Shanghai has such a contradictory phenomenon.

A large number of enemy and puppet properties are publicly bid for. Who can bid for them? Is it you? Is it me? It is very obvious that it is the very few wealthy people. Do these very few wealthy people really bid for them to live in themselves? No! They already have very comfortable foreign houses. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the so-called public bidding for enemy and puppet properties is just helping a few people get rich, supporting the prevailing gold bar and US dollar key money system in Shanghai, and making most people homeless.

If the government's policy is to help a few people get rich, if the government's policy is to support the gold bar and US dollar key money system, most of us will have to be homeless.

### Where to Save Knowledge: Where are the Children Outside the School Gate Going?

— Lü Tian

For the sake of their children's schooling problems, I have visited several schools and asked friends to write many letters of introduction, but everywhere I went, the "no admittance" sign was hung high, "Sorry, there are no places available, we cannot serve you properly." The seriousness of the school shortage has put the education bureau in a difficult situation to deal with. Children cannot study, and parents are even more anxious. It has been a year since the victory, and children cannot even study. How serious is this problem!

The problem of the housing shortage lies not in the scarcity but in the inequality, but the school shortage is really because there are too few schools and not enough classes. Since the recovery of Shanghai, the population has been increasing rapidly. Due to financial and other technical problems, the number of schools cannot be increased in proportion to the increasing population, so everywhere there are too many students and too few places available. In order to adapt to the current situation and alleviate the severity of the school shortage, the "half-day system" should be universally adopted immediately; students spend half a day at school and half a day at home, concentrating the courses in the half-day at school, and moving after-school work and rest to the half-day at home. In this way, one classroom can accommodate two classes of students, and a school that could only enroll 500 students can now enroll 1,000. I cannot say how good the half-day system is, but at least, the schooling problems of many students - especially primary school students - can be solved.

Regarding the implementation of the half-day system, there are a few more points that need to be explained:

(1) Fully utilize space: The central problem of the school shortage is finance, and school buildings account for the center of finance. After the implementation of the half-day system, in the same classroom, Class A attends class in the morning and Class B attends class in the afternoon. People can take turns to rest, and space is fully utilized.

(2) Save material resources: Currently, the education authorities cannot balance school funding and actual expenses. After the implementation of the half-day system, the number of classes will increase, and the class funding of a school must be allocated in full, but the ordinary expenses such as rent, water, and electricity will not increase by half due to the increase of half the classes. In this way, overall payment can reduce part of the imbalance between income and expenditure.

(3) Improve teachers' treatment: Currently, an average of about one and a half teachers are responsible for one grade in primary schools. After the implementation of the half-day system, because of the concentration of class affairs, one teacher can be responsible for one grade. Teachers are certainly more hard-working, but their treatment can be improved. In this way, the allocation of funding for each grade is still the usual practice for the authorities, but it is a small compensation for teachers. In today's situation where teachers' treatment cannot match the social cost of living index, it can also give them a little relief.

The main purpose of implementing the half-day system is to eliminate the current pathological state of insufficient primary school classes. Please, enlightened education administrative authorities, formulate methods as soon as possible and submit them for implementation to save the children who are wandering outside the school gate and cannot enter!

### The World of Gods and Monsters

— Tianyi

The inventions in the world now are somewhat similar to the various things in gods and monsters novels (such as The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple, Journey to the West, and Investiture of the Gods).

For example, in these gods and monsters novels, the most common and well-known thing is that those swordsmen and immortals can spit out flying swords and take people's heads from thousands of miles away, or with a wave of their hands, a white light will go out. However, during this war, London, England, was often attacked by Germany's V1 and V2, and Meteor missiles. These Meteor missiles all flew from distant Germany, and their tails also had white light. Isn't this somewhat like flying swords?

Secondly, there are those immortals and swordsmen who can stand in the clouds and watch the lower world, watching everything in the lower world. However, today there is the invention of direct-landing airplanes, and it is also like the characters in The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple who often unleash palm thunder. Today, there are atomic bombs controlled by wireless radio. In Investiture of the Gods, there are two people, Flying Sky and Drilling Earth. Flying Sky is already known to everyone, there are airplanes, and Drilling Earth can enter tunnels (this is not yet available in our country, but it has long been available in European and American countries). Furthermore, there are some swordsmen and immortals who can fight fiercely in the water for seven days and seven nights. This has long been replaced by warships and submarines!

Also, in Investiture of the Gods, there are two people, Thousand-Mile Eyes and Wind-Following Ears. Thousand-Mile Eyes has a telescope, and today it is further advanced with the invention of wireless radio facsimile machines. Wind-Following Ears is still replaced by wireless radio.

However, so far there does not seem to be an invention that can match Sun Wukong's somersault - 108,000 miles.

In short, the world now is already like those swordsmen and immortals in old gods and monsters novels who are fighting treasures. It depends on who has more magic weapons and whose magic weapons are more powerful, and whoever can be king.

### Can't Live Anymore!

— Pingjing

Teachers, this sacred and noble profession, are the gardeners of the nation's tender seedlings, the nannies of the new generation. Every advanced country attaches great importance to the status of teachers. Because the fate of the country in ten or twenty years lies in the hands of the teachers who are gardeners and nannies today.

However, in our China, it is a bit different. Teachers cannot even get some stability in their lives, and they are always shouting that they cannot live anymore! Humph! Smart people all think that being a teacher is a dead end. Only fools want to do it.

Fortunately, at the beginning of the War of Resistance against Japan and the founding of the country, the government authorities immediately and correctly put forward the slogan "Education First in the Founding Period." At the same time, many places also launched movements to respect teachers. But, sadly, how much can two beautiful and pleasant slogans help? How much has a one-time charitable "respect for teachers" improved the status of teachers?

Teachers' treatment is not as good as that of rickshaw pullers, workers, or vendors. Mr. Tao deeply lamented and said: "Also taking care of children for people, life is not as good as a nanny." Then, is the value of teachers' work not even as good as that of soldiers, workers, vendors, and nannies? Friends! Please calculate it again! In the founding period, in what place should teachers rank?

Teachers are people, not "supermen." They also have families and they also have to live. Are we really going to let teachers eat "sacred food" and wear "noble clothes" for a lifetime?

Teachers are leaving. Many teachers want to desert from the education ranks. Are we really going to let the education world be filled with scummy teachers? Alas! How many good teachers are still sticking to their posts and remaining unswerving?

According to general estimates, at least 80% of the teachers engaged in primary school education are young female teachers without family burdens. Of course, I am not saying that female teachers are not suitable for education. There are indeed many education warriors among female teachers who are enthusiastic about education. However, we can clearly see that male teachers are gradually retiring. Their living burdens make it impossible for them to exist in the education world. They have the ambition to dedicate their lives to education, but the whip of life constantly urges them, causing them to painfully gradually withdraw from the education world.

Although the local education authorities have also promulgated the laws and regulations of the Private School Economic Open Organization Funding Review Committee in order to improve teachers' treatment, stipulating that all tuition income should be used as teachers' salaries and distributed equally and reasonably, the facts tell us that in addition to a few enlightened principals who are willing to follow the regulations automatically, another part of the school owners who profit from the school still turn a blind eye or use various methods to cover up, such as adding nominal positions, etc. If teachers really want to strive for it, well, this will lay the main cause for dismissal at the end of the semester. Most teachers are still silent.

Therefore, we hope that the education authorities should put forward more effective methods to strictly check at any time whether private schools are complying with the laws, because in this city, private schools still account for the majority of schools in the city. Those responsible for schools who disregard the laws should be severely punished.

At the same time, regarding the method of paying private school teachers' salaries in one lump sum at the beginning of the semester, we hope that the education authorities can also announce it in the shortest possible time. Our reasons are as follows:

(1) The school authorities collect the tuition fees in one lump sum. And when collecting tuition fees at the beginning of the semester, the standard is roughly not far from the ratio of usual prices. However, by the end of the semester, half a year has passed, and price fluctuations are too severe. For example, a salary of 50,000 at the beginning of the last semester (economically open schools are probably around this number, but some schools actually have 5,000 without food and accommodation) can buy about four piculs of rice, but by the end of the semester, 50,000 salary cannot even buy one picul of rice.

(2) Avoid increasing the burden on parents and collecting tuition fees a second time in the middle of the semester, because the salary is paid in one lump sum, the teachers can decide on a semester's plan, and their lives can be slightly guaranteed. Why collect tuition fees a second time?

(3) If the principal is worried about teachers resigning in the middle of the semester, they can take security money and guarantee. Anyway, the amount guaranteed is only the small amount of salary for one semester. In case of resignation in the middle of the semester, the guarantor will of course compensate for the loss.

(4) Or if it is thought that there is no precedent for this in other occupational sectors and public schools, it should be known that the allocated number of private school teachers' salaries in a semester has been stipulated, and there will never be the possibility of adjustment or extra income, such as teacher respect money and collecting tuition fees a second time. These can only be said to be remedial measures after the panic of teachers' lives, so why not prevent it before the start of the semester?

We hope that the above suggestions will be considered by the education authorities, and we hope that teachers, principals, parents, and students will discuss them together and make corrections, so as to reduce the sadness of teachers even by a little bit. Teachers will be fortunate! Education will be fortunate! The country will be fortunate!

### Grievances

— Ruiyun

Middle school tuition is 200,000, university is 300,000, public funding for national universities is reduced to 30%, and the entrance examination is more difficult than ascending to heaven. The country has not arranged a path for young people to take. Where should young people go?

The treatment of female workers in yarn factories is more than 200,000 per month. A female English professor at a famous national university is also only 200,000 per month. If it is solely for living, all the professors will change their careers.

Last year, overseas Chinese were massacred. If we had moved troops westward and given a slight punishment at that time, the tragedy of massacring overseas Chinese would definitely not have happened again in various parts of the world.

### A Smile

In the morning, in a very crowded tram, a man "sitting" by the window suddenly put his head in his hands and covered his eyes with his hands. The people next to him asked, "Are you sick? I have ready-made medicine, do you want to take it?"

"No, no," the man replied, "It's really because I saw those old ladies standing there, being crowded by people, and I feel very sad in my heart!"

After Lai's husband died, Lai was very sad. In the cemetery, she almost fainted from grief. In the car on the way back, she was still crying loudly. Her friend couldn't help but persuade her: "Hey! Don't be too sad. Actually, it doesn't matter much. Although it is indeed making you very sad now, after six months, when you meet a middle-aged wealthy businessman, in the blink of an eye, you will get married again!"

Lai said angrily: "Six months! You bastard, what am I going to do tonight?"

### A Few Words to Fathers (Part 1)

— Zhou Shang

"We must ensure that the next generation is stronger in body than us, superior in intelligence than us, and surpasses us in moral character!"

Father means baba, dieye, or yeye. Ji Yun: "The Wu people call father ba." Zheng Zi Tong: "Barbarians call elders baba or baba, later people added the radical for 'father' to create the character ba." Nan Shi: "Die, means father." Song Shi, Biography of Zong Ze: "Common people call father yeye."

Although Father's Day has passed, I still want to say a few words to fathers about the "Way of the Father." In ancient books, there are terms like mother as teacher, maternal education, maternal model, and maternal example, but for a time, no equivalent for "the Way of the Father" could be found. Today's education only teaches people how to make a living and how to do things, but it doesn't teach people how to be a father. Normal school education only teaches people how to be teachers of other people's children, and it doesn't teach them how to be their own children's teachers. Some gentlemen in Shanghai are promoting Father's Day. I think the meaning of this holiday should not be for children to respect their fathers, but rather to talk more about fatherly education, so that those who have become fathers but still don't know how to be one can think about it.

The main topic of fatherly education is "the Way of the Father." The object of the Way of the Father is children. The upbringing of children is the mother's responsibility, but it is also the father's responsibility. In ancient times, it was said that "the mother toiled," because the scholars themselves raised their sons. But nowadays, in addition to being good wives and mothers, women also work in national professions. They carry the double burden of being both father and mother, especially at present, they are living a destructive life of "burning the candle at both ends." The traditional Chinese women's outlook on life is based on the spirit of self-sacrifice, working like oxen and horses without expecting rewards, enduring a hundred times, enduring silently until death. But fathers should also understand this and share the responsibility of raising children. Do not just hold a cigar, sit in an easy chair, look at your nose, speak official jargon to your wife, or even frequent prostitutes, gamble, eat extravagantly, and live a life of dissipation, treating the family as a temporary residence.

Today's children are the source of the nation's life and the reserve force for national construction. The future prosperity and strength of a nation depends on whether the children of that nation are healthy now. Goujian implemented the internal policy of "ten years of reproduction, ten years of training." These two major tasks mostly belong to the Way of the Father. The minimum requirement of the Way of the Father is to ensure that the next generation is stronger in body than us, superior in intelligence than us, and surpasses us in moral character, so that the next generation is stronger than their grandfathers and ancestors, and that the next generation is full of outstanding talents for the future nation.

To realize the above, we must focus on the Way of the Father. To focus on the Way of the Father, we must first pay attention to the following four things concerning children: first, health protection; second, moral cultivation; third, knowledge development; and fourth, marriage guidance. Now, please learn from me:

1.  Health Protection—Only a nation with first-class physical health can build a first-class country. If a nation is to have a golden age of culture, its people must first have a golden age of physical health thirty years earlier. If you want your children to have great ambitions, do great things, and become famous in later generations, you must first nurture them to have a strong and healthy body. In ancient times, the practice of "archery and chariot driving" had a profound meaning, embodying national defense in self-defense. Health is divided into two aspects: mental and physical, and they influence each other. A foundation must be laid from an early age, and special attention must be paid to every stage from conception to university studies. Fathers should take care of their mothers' lives during pregnancy, especially their diets. The superstitious "prenatal education" of the past is actually "prenatal nourishment," because the fetus's nerves are not related to the mother's body, so there is no way to teach it. Only blood vessels are connected to the mother's body, allowing it to absorb food. Children's baby teeth and permanent teeth are rooted and developed in the early stages of conception. With appropriate nutrition, their teeth will be strong. Also, if children are abused when they are young, they are more likely to develop mental illness or even commit suicide when they grow up. These are just a few examples. The period from a child's birth to five years old is really the nutrition period; six to twelve years old is the period of large muscle exercise; and only after twelve years old do they enter the stage of knowledge cultivation. As a father, one should thoroughly understand this and nurture and protect them with caution.
