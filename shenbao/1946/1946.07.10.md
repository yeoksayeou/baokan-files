[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The Communist troops in Northern Jiangsu are extremely busy preparing for war, reaching a fever pitch. It is learned that between Donghai and Xuzhou, and from Xuzhou north to Pukou, effectively up to Shaobo, there are gatherings of 70,000 to 80,000 Communist troops in each location. Especially south of Shaobo, around the Grand Canal dikes, martial law is in effect, with landmines extensively laid, cutting off pedestrian traffic. Furthermore, Li Yimin, Chairman of the Communist Party's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region government, accompanied by Liu Ze, commander of the Communist 9th Regiment, Huang Yisan, commander of the 25th Regiment, and about thirty attendants, traveled from Huaiyin by small speed boat to the Gaoyou-Shaobo area on the 8th to inspect and convene a secret military conference of cadres.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] After launching a major offensive into Northern Jiangsu, the Communist army is now actively expanding its areas of encroachment. Haimen, surrounded by the Communist army, faces a critical situation, with Communist troops continuing to advance fiercely towards the city from all sides. Three divisions transferred from the south have arrived in the Huaiyin, Gaoyou, and Dongtai area, joining the Communist forces there and rapidly advancing towards Luhe and Lai'an on the 6th. The 3rd Division of the Communist army crossed Gaoyou Lake from Gaoyou in the afternoon and landed at Lingtangqiao, continuing its fierce advance towards the east of Luhe. The 2nd Division of the Communist army advanced to the vicinity of Lai'an on the 7th, with subsequent units continuing to follow. The Communist forces gathered in the area between Fengxian, Pei County, Dangshan, and Yongcheng number about 20,000 and are pressing towards Dangshan, attempting to cut off traffic on the Longhai Railway. The puppet troops under Hao Pengju, incorporated by the Communist army, have also advanced to Baitabu and Shahezhen and are continuing to press towards Donghai.

### Communist Troops Repulsed in Zao Yang; Xinye Falls; Situation in Yicheng Unclear; Communist Troops Gather North of the Zhang River in Southern Tianjin

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 9th] The Communist forces under Li Xiannian of the Central Plains Military Region have been fiercely attacking Zao Yang in successive waves for days, and fighting is in progress. The Communist troops who infiltrated near Qingtai, 15 kilometers north of Zao Yang, were resisted by local villagers for looting grain.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The "Central Plains Military Region" of the Communist army launched a large-scale offensive on June 29th, and it has continued for ten days until the 8th. The Wen Jianwu column and parts of the Wang Shusheng column, which invaded northern Hubei, fiercely attacked Suiyangdian, Zaolin Store, and Liuti, attempting to seize Zao Yang, but were repulsed by the National Army. The Wang Shusheng column of the Communist army, which crossed the Xiang River to invade Xuancheng, has increased reinforcements to besiege the city, and the situation there is unclear. At the same time, the Liu Bocheng column of the Communist army also gathered 80,000 troops in northern Henan and launched a large-scale offensive, fiercely attacking Tangyin, Wuzhi, and Wenxian in separate directions. Observers here believe that the simultaneous large-scale offensive launched by the Li Xiannian and Liu Bocheng columns towards various places in Hubei and Henan clearly marks the opening of their full-scale internal strife.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] Over 20,000 Communist troops who have been harassing southern Henan and northern Hubei are trending towards joining forces on the west bank of the Laokou and Xiang Rivers. Mengjialou, 60 li north of Laokou, was found to be occupied by Communist troops on the morning of the 9th. The vanguard unit of Li Xiannian, the Wang Shusheng column, also infiltrated from Yicheng towards Cihe and Gucheng on the 8th. One unit of the First Column under Li Xiannian's command infiltrated from Guotan, 70 li north of Zao Yang, on the 8th; one unit captured Xinye on the morning of the 8th; one unit infiltrated Goulinji, 40 li south of Deng County; and another unit infiltrated Shayan, 70 li south of Nanyang, crossed the Bai River from Fanji on the afternoon of the 8th, and infiltrated Jitan, over 60 li east of Deng County.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The Communist troops on the Zhengtai Railway are actively withdrawing southward. The Zhengtai Railway has been restored to peace. The 5th Brigade of the Communist army, which previously attacked Niangziguan, has withdrawn to Gaoyi, trending towards the Zhang River. The Communist troops in Yuanshi have also withdrawn to the vicinity of the Zhang River, seemingly intending to concentrate heavy troops near the Zhang River to prevent the National Army from opening up the Pinghan Railway.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] Qingxian in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway is still surrounded by the Communist army. Communist troops are also harassing the vicinity of Maguan. A rail repair train heading north from Cangxian reached Xingji on the 9th. A rail repair train heading south is currently working in Chen Guantun. Zhaopo, 15 hua li southeast of Xiaocangxian, was captured by the Communist army on the 6th, and they are currently attacking the city walls.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The seven columns under the jurisdiction of the Communist army's Jin-Ji-Yu Military Region (each column has three brigades, and each brigade has three regiments), plus about 100,000 Communist troops from southern Hebei and northern Henan, are gathering on the north bank of the Zhang River.

### Lu Han, Sun Liren, etc., Arrive in Shenyang; Dai Berleman Flies to Changchun Today; Arrangement for Du Yuming-Lin Biao Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] Shenyang is once again a gathering place for military stars. Generals Lu Han and Sun Liren have both newly arrived in Shenyang to discuss matters with Du Yuming. Rumors of a reorganization of the Northeast institutions are again rampant. Whether Du Yuming and Lin Biao can meet as scheduled without postponement remains to be seen, but it is a fact that both official and Communist sides here do not attach importance to this meeting. However, some minor local issues may be resolved. It is heard that the government side is prepared to propose at the Du-Lin-Dai meeting that the Communist army not destroy the small county's telephone and telegraph lines to Shenyang and release the captured personnel in Changchun. Dai Berleman is still staying here today and will fly to Changchun tomorrow to arrange the Du-Lin meeting. Officials have given a very relaxed explanation for Dai's visit to Beiping, saying that he is returning to Beiping to request clothing and food rations from the American side of the Executive Headquarters for replenishments.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 9th] Recently, there have been rumors of the Communist army withdrawing from Harbin. After reporters inquired with military and political authorities, all stated that they had not received official information on this and would wait for the facts to prove it.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Regarding the mission of Army Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong to the Northeast, the reporter interviewed Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, who replied: Mr. Gu's trip is just a routine inspection and he will return to Nanjing in a short time.

### Beiping Establishes Air Defense Department; Emphasizes Training of the Public

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The Beiping Air Defense Headquarters was established on July 1st. Personnel assignments are still pending. The address will be located in Zhongnanhai inside the Yintai. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Hu Bohan told reporters: All countries in the world have air defense headquarters, and China cannot be an exception. Therefore, the headquarters is of a permanent nature. The primary task of the department is to focus on training the public.

### Railway Between Beiping and Taiyuan is Open

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The railway between Beiping and Taiyuan is now open without obstruction. All stations on the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines have resumed joint passenger and freight transport. Many independent merchants are traveling back and forth. However, all stations are prohibited from transporting food out of the area. Except for military transport, coal from Jingxing is not allowed to be freely transported out. The Military Mediation Department has not been able to take effective measures to restore Pinghan Railway traffic. The Railway Bureau is now making preparations for road repairs and has ordered all stations to dismantle and transport unimportant branch lines in preparation for construction southward from Shijiazhuang.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th] The western section of the Jiaoji Railway was repaired to Puji on the 7th and is continuing to be repaired eastward, with the goal of achieving full operation soon. The traffic train between Jinan and Zao Yang Temple is scheduled to extend to Mingshui starting on the 9th.

### Political Atmosphere in the Capital Still Quiet; Chairman Receives Xu Yongchang; Marshall Exchanges Views with Chen Cheng and Wang Shijie

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] It is heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned General Xu Yongchang, the government representative to the Military Three-Person Committee, today and gave instructions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The political atmosphere remains quiet. Spokespersons said this afternoon that a meeting of the Three-Person Committee might be convened tonight, but as of midnight, there had been no such development.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th] Special Envoy Marshall met with Wang Shijie, Chen Cheng, and Shao Lizi today to exchange views. The results of the meeting were not announced. This was the only important meeting in the capital today.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] In view of the mediation of the Central Plains war, Marshall specially dispatched a special plane to Hankou today to invite the American and Communist representatives in the Executive Team in Hankou to Nanjing. They arrived at 3 pm and will report to Marshall within days to provide a basis for Marshall's mediation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A reporter learned from responsible government sources that the so-called Five-Person Committee is a misnomer. The representatives of the government and the Communist Party are only exchanging views temporarily. Rumors that subsequent discussions will be held in this fixed format are incorrect.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 8th] A Communist Party spokesman announced today that the situation is extremely critical for two reasons: first, peace talks have completely stalled, and second, fighting has broken out in various places. The government is equally pessimistic. Zhou Enlai met with Chairman Chiang and government representatives three times. The government resolutely refused the Communist Party's request to retain local governments in the areas from which the Communist army withdraws, with no hope of compromise. Therefore, Zhou has given up direct negotiations with the government. A Kuomintang spokesman said that this deadlock has existed since the beginning of June, and despite various efforts, it has not been broken.

### Luo Longji Visits Marshall; Democratic League to Hold Meeting in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Luo Longji, a representative of the Democratic League, visited Special Envoy Marshall at around 11:00 am this morning to discuss unresolved political issues in the Five-Person Committee talks and exchange views on breaking the current deadlock. He left after about an hour. Luo took the night train to Shanghai tonight.

[Our Newspaper Report] It is learned that the Democratic League plans to hold a meeting in Shanghai. Luo Longji was scheduled to take the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai last night. Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, and other members of the Democratic League in Shanghai will begin discussions as soon as the representatives from Nanjing, Luo Longji, Zhang Shenfu, and Liang Shuming, arrive in Shanghai. At that time, a compromise solution to the Kuomintang-Communist Party issue will be collectively drafted and offered to both sides.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th] Representatives of the Democratic League attending the Political Consultative Conference will meet in Shanghai tomorrow to hear a report from Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji on the current situation, so there is hope that the political deadlock will be broken. According to Luo, he requested to meet with Marshall this morning in order to obtain the best information. After I go to Shanghai to report on the current situation, I will discuss whether the Democratic League can propose a proposal that satisfies both sides so that peace talks can be reopened. I believe that the only way to break the deadlock is to restore the Military Three-Person Committee meeting. Marshall can exert necessary pressure on both sides during the meeting. The Democratic League is very disappointed that the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations have not been successful. Since the government has refused to convene a comprehensive committee meeting of the Political Consultative Conference to discuss political issues, then having Marshall chair and reopen the Military Three-Person Committee meeting is the only way to move towards peace. The Democratic League is not opposed to the convening of the National Assembly, but it firmly opposes unilaterally deciding the date of the meeting.

### Injured Reporters in Xiaguan Receive Medical Compensation

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th] The four Nanjing news reporters injured in the Xiaguan incident received cash compensation from the Central Propaganda Department today.

After listening to Zeng's opinions, Marshall replied to Zeng in sincere and humble terms, saying that the American people, regardless of government or the public, earnestly hope that China will be peaceful, united, and become a rich, strong, and happy country. He personally hopes for peace in China and will continue to work hard. It is heard that the Marshall-Zeng meeting lasted about an hour. Marshall inquired in detail about the Youth Party's policies, and Zeng said that the Youth Party's position is that, in addition to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it is the third largest party that maintains independence and neutrality, representing the petty bourgeoisie, which is the people of the middle class. The characteristics of the Youth Party are (1) independence, (2) neutrality, and (3) constructiveness. The Marshall-Zeng conversation lasted an hour.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The first symposium on the Party and Government Reform Movement for Party members in the capital was held in the afternoon on the 8th, inviting responsible persons from the various district Party headquarters in the capital to participate. About 200 people including Liang Hancao and Yu Jingtang attended. He Zhonghan chaired the meeting.

### Soviet Opposition to US Aid to China Intended to Prevent Our Strength; Analysis by New York Times Reporter

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] New York Times correspondent in Moscow, Middleton, reports that for a week, the Moscow press has fiercely opposed U.S. interference in Chinese affairs. Pravda even accused the United States of violating the Moscow Agreement not to interfere in China's internal affairs. The reason for the Soviet Union's attitude is that after the collapse of the powerful Eastern nation of Japan in World War II, the Soviet Union believed that the development and plans of the Soviet Far East could proceed unimpeded from now on, and hoped that no other powerful nation would rise up to be the Soviet Union's enemy. Therefore, we should observe this from this perspective: The Soviet Union blames the U.S. for military aid to China. He also pointed out the Chinese part of the Soviet Union's world policy, saying that although the Soviet Union was among the strongest countries after the war, the development of various situations since the end of the war has weakened the hopes of the Soviet Union's expected expansion period. One of these developments is the continued U.S. aid to China. Soviet newspapers commented that China, with its huge manpower and "reactionary" government, could become an area of military development to interfere with the Soviet Union's plans in the Siberian interior and Primorsky Krai. The Soviet Union believes that after the disappearance of Japanese pressure, the Soviet Union should have the right to do what it wants on both the east and west sides and does not want the United States to assist an Asian government that is uniquely capable of rivaling the Soviet Union. This meaning is very clear in the comments of various newspapers.

### Sino-American Agricultural Technology Mission Paid Respects to Chairman and Ambassador Ma Yesterday and Will Immediately Begin Studying Our Agricultural Problems

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chairman Chiang received the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Delegation at his official residence at 4:00 PM today. The delegation, which arrived in Nanjing yesterday afternoon, consisted of eighteen people: H. H. Love, Homer, Buck, Meier, Miss A. C., Ke Yu, Ge Shi, Xie Zhi, Shen Zonghan, Ye Qianji, Yun Wansen, Yang Maochun, Lin Gang, Wu Jinqing, Ma Baozhi, and others. They were accompanied by Zhou Yichun, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The three American representatives of the delegation paid a courtesy visit to Special Envoy Marshall at 12:35 PM this morning. In the next few days, they will collectively visit the ministers of various central ministries. Starting from the 11th, they will begin discussing issues related to agricultural education, research, promotion, and finance. They are scheduled to visit the Jinling University and National Central University agricultural colleges and their affiliated farms on the 19th.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Delegation was received by Chairman Chiang today, who hosted a tea party. According to the American experts, the Chairman was extremely cordial, deeply concerned about the delegation's plan, and inquired about various issues.

[Another Dispatch] The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Delegation began its research today, hoping to formulate a plan to ensure that the Chinese people have no worries about food and to restore the export of its main agricultural products to provide foreign exchange and maintain the national economy. The delegation consists of twenty members, ten of whom are American agricultural experts selected by the U.S. government, and ten are Chinese agricultural and trade talents selected by the government. The delegation is tasked with going to Shenyang and northern Manchuria, and hopes that the CCP leaders will cooperate with them to investigate the agricultural situation in the "liberated areas" controlled by the Communist army. In addition to investigating the backwardness of Chinese agricultural technology, diagnosing its ailments, and seeking to increase production and improve quality, the delegation will also formulate plans to improve China's tung oil, silk, tea, carpets, and fisheries, and increase their output. The delegation will be divided into five teams, each with at least one American expert, who will work with Chinese members to thoroughly investigate their production and sales methods. The delegation will focus on the quality of Chinese export goods and standardize them. In the past, exports from China and other Eastern countries lacked standards, and the quality of each batch of goods was inconsistent, making sales difficult. One of the main problems for the agricultural delegation is to suggest a method so that those purchasing tung oil carpets from China in New York or London can be sure of the quality of the goods they are purchasing. Once the investigation is complete, they will reconvene in Nanjing or Shanghai to prepare to make recommendations.

### French Economic Delegation Discusses Sino-French Trade Relations and Will Discuss Ways to Promote Them with Us

[Agence France-Presse Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Henri Hoppenot, head of the French Economic Delegation to the Far East, who came to Nanjing on official business, issued a statement today, saying that the purpose of the French Economic Delegation to the Far East is to promote the development of technical, industrial, and trade relations between China and France. France has historically exported industrial equipment and chemicals to China, while importing raw silk, tea, and other special manufactured goods, such as light bulbs and rare minerals necessary for French industry. Vietnam's exports to China are mainly rice, coal, and rubber. After the restoration of security in Vietnam, the export of rice may resume. France's transportation and steel industries have recovered, and heavy industry is also active, so France may regain its position in the world market. Currently, trade relations with China are hindered by high prices in China, and this point will be one of the items to be discussed when I hold negotiations with the Chinese authorities in the future. I can confidently say that by September of this year, French ships can resume sailing between Shanghai, Haiphong, and Saigon, and trade between China and Vietnam will be greatly developed. In addition, I hope that an agreement can be reached on the issue of French airlines passing through China, but there is no definite date for the resumption of normal air traffic between the two countries.

### Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Group Recommends Construction of Three Major Highway Lines Total Expenses Over Three Hundred Million U.S. Dollars

[Report from This Newspaper] It is reported that the construction of highways in our country after the war, due to the limitation of reconstruction funds and the unstable domestic situation, will still focus on maintenance work at the current stage. As for new highways, it has been tentatively decided to construct three lines: (1) from Shanghai via Nanjing, Hankou to Chongqing, (2) from Xi'an to Hankou, (3) from Beiping to Tanggu. The construction of these three highway lines was recommended by the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, adopted by the Highway Administration, and personnel have been dispatched in batches to various sections to carry out surveying and mapping work. All three highway lines are first-class standard national highways, with a road surface width planned to be 6 to 7 meters and a roadbed width planned to be 9 to 12 meters. The road surface is planned to be paved with cement. If cement production is insufficient, asphalt or bitumen pavement will be used instead. The original old roads of the three lines are too badly damaged and the slopes are too far from the standard. Therefore, the construction of the new roads will not utilize the old roads, and new routes will be opened up entirely. However, this project is huge, with estimated expenses of US$337,395,250. The official commencement of the project depends on the loan from the United States.

[Another Dispatch] The tasks of the American consultants of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan have been largely completed, and they will gradually leave China and return to the United States in the near future. Also, Hou Jiayuan, the leader of the group, went to Beijing yesterday morning (9th) on official business.

### Cultural Traitor Wen Yuanmo Publicly Tried at the Nanjing High Court Yesterday

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Wen Yuanmo, one of the major traitors in North China, was tried for the first time at the Capital High Court on the 9th. Wen Yuanmo is 55 years old, a native of Guiyang. He studied natural sciences in Japan in his early years.

Since August of the 27th year, he willingly accepted the invitation of the traitor Tang Erhe, served as the dean of the Faculty of Science of the puppet Peking University, and was appointed by the enemy as the director of the Faculty of Engineering of the East Asian Cultural Association.

When he was interrogated on the 9th, Court President Ge Zitan presided over the trial and announced that the trial would be adjourned to 9:00 AM on the 22nd.

### Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate Warrants the Arrest of Traitor Gao Zhongli

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate issued an arrest warrant for the traitor Gao Zhongli on the 9th. Gao Zhongli became attached to the enemy at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, serving as a member of the standing committee of the Second District of the puppet Lianglu Party Department and the deputy director of the Shanghai North Station. In October of the 28th year, he induced the arrest of Li Dasan, a member of the Lianglu Party Department. Recently, the Special Party Department Executive Committee of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways reported him to the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate. When the Railway Management Committee detained him, Gao Zhongli absconded in fear of punishment.

### Puyi's Crimes are the Same as Wang Jingwei's and Should Not Be Regarded as a War Criminal

Statement by Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Puyi, the "puppet emperor," was captured by the Soviets after the victory and detained in Boly. After repeated negotiations by our government, the Soviets have agreed to extradite him to our country. Recently, there have been rumors that he will be escorted to Beijing and tried as a war criminal. Today, a reporter met with Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, and inquired about this matter. According to his statement: Puyi was originally a citizen of the Republic of China. His actions in the Nine Eastern Provinces, willingly being used by the enemy and falsely claiming to be emperor, are similar to the crimes of Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo. He should be convicted as a traitor and should not be regarded as a war criminal. War criminals must have committed the crimes of invading a country and causing war. The "Manchukuo" puppet regime has not been recognized by our country, nor has it been recognized internationally. Moreover, the Northeast has now been recovered by us. All former officials of the puppet Manchukuo should be punished as traitors. Traitors and war criminals should never be confused.

### Editorial: Please Allied Nations Understand China

China is one of the five major powers of the United Nations. In today's world of increasingly developed transportation, China and its allies have frequent exchanges and close relationships, which goes without saying. The Chinese people must understand the allied nations, and the allied nations must also understand China. Mrs. Roosevelt once said that demanding international cooperation must begin with international understanding, which is indeed a penetrating statement. And today, we must first ask the allied nations to understand China, and there are several fundamental points.

First, China is a peace-loving country, and the Chinese people are especially peace-loving. Traditional Chinese thought has always opposed "aggression"; sayings such as "stopping war to show power" and "those who are good at war should be severely punished" are especially embraced by the Chinese people. Special Envoy Marshall said at a farewell banquet for General Feng Yuxiang that the Chinese people used to be fond of philosophy, but now they are very different from before, and seem to be fond of war. Perhaps Marshal Marshall's words were spoken in jest, out of deep affection, but in fact, the Chinese people in general are definitely not fond of war. Currently, there are many places in China where there is an "on-and-off" civil war, the reason for which is that a few "fire-starters" want to use military force to争夺地盘, which is definitely not what the people want. Even the more they say "oppose the civil war," the more vigorously they actually "fight the civil war." Therefore, what the people hope for is not the beautiful slogan of "opposing the civil war," but the fact of eliminating the civil war based on justice and fairness. The Chinese people believe that the only way to stop the civil war is to advocate justice and fairness, distinguish right from wrong, and then give the peace disruptors the punishment they deserve to make them dare not provoke, which will be effective; otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. Mrs. Marshall said that Marshal Marshall could not sleep or eat well because of his mediation work. While we are ashamed and grateful, the fact that Marshal Marshall was unable to exercise his right of arbitration as a mediator is indeed a major factor in the delay in making a decision. Therefore, we first ask the allied nations to understand that it is not that the Chinese people are fond of war and do not love peace, but that the Communist Party opposes arbitration and obstructs peace.

Second, the Chinese people today are neither willing to be subservient to foreigners nor intentionally xenophobic. Subservience to foreigners or xenophobia is caused by a sense of national inferiority. Only those who have cultivated a subservient mentality toward foreigners will have xenophobic words and actions. The two come from the same source. China is a member of the United Nations, and unequal treaties have been abolished. The Chinese people should be self-reliant and self-strengthening. Why be subservient to foreigners? And all nations that treat us as equals, based on forgiveness, certainly do not want China to flatter them again. As for xenophobia, we have received much help during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. We are now striving to work hand in hand with the allied nations, so how can we妄图閉關自守? Moreover, the United States has sincerely helped us, and the U.S. military is currently stationed in China with a mission, so the Chinese people have no anti-American sentiment at all. Although the Yan'an Communist Party's "July 7th Declaration" still clamors for "U.S. troops to withdraw from China" based on the anti-American arguments of Moscow newspapers and Mao Zedong's anti-American broadcasts, discerning people can definitely see where the command post of this shallow cry is, and it is definitely not what a patriotic Chinese people want to issue. Professor Pei Fei, an authority on U.S. Far Eastern affairs, recently came to China and discussed the current situation in our country with reporters in Nanjing, saying that China urgently needs national peace and unity. The United States also sincerely hopes that China will be democratically and peacefully unified, and has no political or territorial ambitions. The stationing of U.S. troops in China is beneficial to China's peace and causes suspicion in the Soviet Union, but China can no longer use international contradictions. Whether it hopes to use the Soviet Union to resist the United States or the United States to resist the Soviet Union is wrong. In recent years, Professor Pei Fei can be counted as one of the best in understanding China among the allied nations.

Third, the Chinese people are determined not to see another world war, especially not to see the flames of world war break out on Chinese soil first. Therefore, China has no intention of exploiting international contradictions for its own benefit. Frankly speaking, China is nominally one of the five powers, but it is still the "weakest" of the five. We can only treat each other with sincerity to gain the trust of the allied nations. In the late Qing Dynasty, those who handled foreign affairs had the idea of "using barbarians to control barbarians," but we believe that the national government will never adopt this inferior strategy. In today's China, when discussing international routes, there may be two completely different opinions: relying on the United States to resist the oppression of the Soviet Union. In fact, both of these views are either foolish or妄, and are unacceptable. China, between the United States and the Soviet Union, even if it cannot fulfill the mission of being a bridge between the two countries, at least does not want to use the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union to cause war, because if war is inevitable, then the first victims will not be the United States and the Soviet Union, but China, which will become a battlefield. What we want the allied nations to understand is that China today only knows how to work hand in hand with nations that treat us as equals, only knows how to abide by the international treaties that China has signed, and will never oppose the Soviet Union, nor will it ever oppose the United States; but at the same time, it does not want a part of the people to rely on foreign influence to cater to one country and oppose another. This is the way for the Chinese people to be self-reliant; this is also the way for the Chinese state to maintain world peace.

### After the Opening of the Shanghai-Hankou-Kunming Line, the Transportation to Kunming Improves

[Our Newspaper Kunming Aviation News] Nearly a year after Japan's surrender, everything here is still not much different from the war period. More than 100,000 people from other provinces who have been in Kunming for several years, even if their hearts are set on returning home, have not been able to leave Kunming by more than one-third due to the lack of transportation. The news of the restoration of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is still extremely vague, and there is no possibility of opening the line within this year due to the lack of materials. In terms of air transport, the China Aviation Corporation is doing a good job. Passengers on the Kunming-Chongqing and Kunming-Hanoi lines can make their trips on schedule after registering. However, it is heard that tickets for flights or ship berths from Chongqing to Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin are extremely difficult, so Chongqing is called a "dead end." Returnees here regard it as a dangerous road and dare not go there rashly. Since the Central Company's Shanghai-Hankou-Kunming flight opened on the 1st of this month, a new route has been opened for returnees in Kunming.

Songjiang Training Instructor Escaped in Fear of Embezzlement

Tong Cheng, a technical instructor in the first squadron of the county security team (from Xiangtan, Hunan), was always extravagant and spent money without restraint.

Wu, the deputy squadron commander, discovered this and reported it to the county government, ordering the cooperation in the arrest.

Hangzhou Robbers Rampant Census of Households

The firearms of the self-defense team in Wangjiazhuang Township and the self-defense service team in Yuanjiahui, Haiqing, Hang County, were all confiscated by bandits. There were eight or nine bandits who confiscated the firearms in Yuanjiahui. They spoke in mixed voices and were violent, holding short guns, and the team members could not resist. The county is currently pursuing them. In Jiaxing, in view of the rampant robbers in the countryside, a suppression campaign has been implemented. The county government summoned the heads of various townships and towns to implement a census of households, pay attention to the actions of the unemployed, and collect all firearms from the people to ensure the safety of the community.

### Summoned by the Four Nations of the US, UK, USSR, and France: Peace Conference Invitations Issued Yesterday, Accompanied by Proposed Amendments to the Rules of Procedure; Four Foreign Ministers Begin Discussions on the German Question

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 9th (Broadcast): The French government has today issued invitations to twenty-one countries to attend the Peace Conference to be held on July 29th. These invitations were sent out in the names of the four foreign ministers.

[United Press, Paris, 9th]: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference, previously deadlocked over the convening of the peace conference, broke the impasse after four days and has today turned to discussing the German question. The Soviet Union's "important declaration" on its German policy is now eagerly awaited. There is much speculation about the nature of this announcement, with some suggesting that the Soviet Union intends to establish a central administrative body within the Federal Republic of Germany, together with the US, UK, and France. Others say that the Soviet side will condemn the US and UK for "engaging in secret negotiations behind the Soviet Union's back." After the Foreign Ministers' Conference concludes its discussion of the German question, it will discuss the Austrian question and the Italian political situation. The four foreign ministers will then perhaps adjourn in order to attend the Peace Conference. The rules of procedure for the Peace Conference will be drafted this morning by the four national advisors and submitted to the four foreign ministers for approval in the afternoon.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th]: Regarding the procedures for the Peace Conference to be held on the 29th of this month, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has reached an agreement and decided to send invitations to the participating countries, a total of seventeen, this afternoon. This agreement was reached at the request of French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault, who held a secret meeting and used his compromise proposal as a basis.

Today, the four foreign ministers held one secret meeting and two open meetings, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The first meeting was chaired by US Secretary of State Byrnes and lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes. At the adjournment, the four foreign ministers had not yet reached an agreement on the convening of the Peace Conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated that since the date for convening the Peace Conference had already been jointly decided, he had no intention of reconsidering it and advocated issuing invitations immediately, but hoped that a draft of the rules of procedure for the Peace Conference could be attached to the invitations. Regarding the rules of procedure, the French proposal could serve as a basis for discussion, with only the addition of an amendment stating that all resolutions passed by the Peace Conference plenary session or its committees must be approved by a two-thirds majority of those present. Except for procedural matters, a simple majority would suffice for passage. US Secretary of State Byrnes replied that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference had previously decided on the date for the Peace Conference and should abide by it, but it would be unacceptable to force the Peace Conference to accept a set of rules of procedure by dictation. The US delegation insisted on issuing invitations immediately and was prepared to discuss all suggestions regarding the procedures of the Peace Conference. British Foreign Secretary Bevin held the same view and said that he was prepared to consider all suggestions, provided that the right of the Peace Conference to amend the agenda was not restricted. He also implied that the proposals put forward by France and the Soviet Union after the invitations were issued could be discussed.

Thereupon, Byrnes, in his capacity as chairman, asked the foreign ministers of the UK, France, and the Soviet Union, "Should the invitations be issued immediately?" The British and French representatives gave affirmative answers. Molotov reiterated that he had no intention of postponing the convening of the Peace Conference, but still believed it was necessary to attach a draft of the rules of procedure to the invitations. He said that there were three precedents that could be cited regarding procedural matters: (1) The rules of procedure for the 1919 Peace Conference were decided in advance; (2) The rules of procedure for the United Nations General Assembly were decided in advance by a preparatory committee; (3) Regarding this matter, the French delegation had made suggestions in April of this year, to which all parties had not raised any objections in principle. These suggestions, together with the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union (see above), could be attached to the invitations for issuance. Molotov also implied that if the Four Foreign Ministers Conference could not agree on the procedures for the Peace Conference, then the resolutions passed by the four foreign ministers might become problematic again.

US Secretary of State Byrnes also made it clear that the US delegation would support any resolution unanimously passed by the four foreign ministers in the twenty-one-nation Peace Conference, such as the resolutions that had already been established regarding the issue of Trieste's affiliation, reparations issues, and other matters. British Foreign Secretary Bevin agreed, but the British delegation reserved the right to reconsider any issues that had not been fully resolved. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference then adjourned until 5:00 PM, when it would hold another secret meeting.

### Analysis of Soviet Attitude Toward Germany in the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference: Full Guarantee of the Implementation of Democracy Required; Foreign Troops Should Remain Stationed for a Long Time to Ensure Security

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th]: As the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference is about to discuss the German question, all parties are concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude toward this issue. According to diplomatic sources here, the Soviet political and journalistic circles have not announced any specific plans regarding the future of Germany. However, the Soviet Union's general attitude toward the German question can be seen in the various principles that had been established before Germany's defeat. These principles stipulated that Germany should bear responsibility for the war and should lose territory, but the entire German people should not be punished. Germany must remain unified, but the implementation of democracy must be fully guaranteed. Foreign troops will continue to occupy Germany for a long time to ensure the security of other European countries. The first principle stipulates that the German people, the German national character, and the German state should not be destroyed. The German people must continue to exercise their sovereignty within their territory, and Germany should maintain spiritual, political, and economic unity. Most importantly, Germany should forever cease to threaten the peace and freedom of other countries. However, to achieve this goal, it is essential to fundamentally democratize the political and economic institutions and national spirit of Germany. As for the other principles, they are of secondary nature and can be ignored.

Regarding the division of Germany into several independent small states, not only would it never ensure common peace, but it would also form a threat from the very beginning, because these small states would have no other role to play except to be manipulated by imperialists. The Soviet government believes that Germany should bear responsibility for the war, without any doubt, and recognizes that the entire German people did not offer much resistance to their militarist leaders, but at the same time also believes that the German people should not be punished indiscriminately. For the sake of the German people, not only should reparations be allowed, but territory must also be ceded, so that the German imperialist acts of aggression will never be seen again. The Soviet government believes that the current state of the German border revision is a fait accompli, and this revision is beneficial to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European allies. The Soviet government also attaches particular importance to the results of the recent Polish referendum, in which the vast majority voted in favor of Poland's new borders. The Soviet Union fully recognizes that France has been invaded by Germany three times in less than a hundred years, and the country has the right to obtain security guarantees. The German Ruhr industrial zone should no longer be used as a military and economic weapon and a military factory for direct attacks on France, but the Ruhr area should also not become a stronghold against the Soviet Union.

In short, the Soviet government has not yet put forward a specific plan on the Soviet Union's view of the future status of western Germany. Government officials only believe that the Soviet representatives are eager to solve the German problem and are fully prepared to discuss it. Soviet government officials certainly also admit that the establishment of a peace treaty with Germany is still insufficient; eradicating National Socialism, promoting democracy, and eradicating militarist ideas are all long-term and arduous tasks. The occupation of Germany must last for a considerable period of time. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it took nearly three years to drive out the aggressors under Hitler's command. After suffering a painful lesson, there is no room for compromise on this point.

China was not included in the countries invited to the Peace Conference.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch]: The Shanghai branch of the China National Diplomatic Association believes that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's opposition to China being invited to the Peace Conference was inappropriate. Not only was there no repeated protest, but it was ultimately not agreed to, which is deeply regrettable. A telegram is currently being drafted and sent to the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries, urging them to reconsider. It also telegraphed the Nanjing General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wang, and Ambassador Qian Tai, making a solemn statement and firmly demanding that they argue on the basis of reason to respect China's status.

### Five Small Countries Apply to Join the United Nations: Conflict Lurks in the Security Council

[United Press, New York, 9th]: The United Nations Security Council recently received membership requests from four countries, Albania, Ireland, Portugal, and Outer Mongolia, and now the Kingdom of Transjordan has also requested to join as a member state, leading to the potential causes of conflict that seem to be forming today. Because some of these newly applying countries have deeply biased views on the issues that the council is about to consider, this point may cause disagreements on the issue of whether to allow these countries to join. The Security Council is now scheduled to meet tomorrow at 7:00 PM to discuss temporary rules and study technical decision-making methods so that the International Court of Justice in The Hague will be open to non-member states uniformly.

### Armed Farmers Riot in Central Provinces of the Philippines: Fierce Battle Occurs in Southeastern Suburbs of Manila

[United Press, Manila, 8th]: Armed farmers in the Philippines engaged in a fierce battle before dawn today near the headquarters of the US 13th Air Force near Fort McKinley, six miles southeast of Manila, and were dispersed by the Philippine constabulary. It is not yet known whether this battle was a party struggle or just a clash between bandits. At the same time, the invisible martial law in central Luzon Island also has a strengthening trend. According to Interior Minister Sulyte, the number of Philippine constabulary in the disturbed area will increase. Since the failure of the July 4 truce agreement, the number of conflicts in the central provinces has been increasing daily. The constabulary is ordered to pursue lawbreakers to their hiding places and isolate them until they agree to disarm. According to inspectors from the central provinces, the government's policy of wanting the armed farmers to submit is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree. In addition, the representative of the government of Nueva Ecija province reported that the Huk people in the province refuse to register or hand over their guns, and 80% of the province's rice fields have been abandoned because farmers do not have sufficient protection and dare not go to the fields to work.

### Huk Leader Accuses Government of Implementing Policies

[United Press, Manila, 8th]: Philippine Huk leader Taruc told a reporter from this agency today, accusing President Roxas and other government leaders of reactionary policies, saying that this policy is enough to hinder the restoration of peace in central Luzon Island and cause national disturbances. It is said that agricultural reform is still a fundamental problem, but the illegal violence of the Philippine constabulary has caused turmoil. Eighty percent of the constabulary in central Luzon Island were police officers during the former Japanese occupation, and farmers hate this group to the bone. Recently, as a result of a conflict between villagers and government personnel, 100 farmers died, and farmers' wives in Pampanga province were raped by constables everywhere. Two labor union leaders had their tongues cut off.

### International Red Cross Holds First Meeting After the War: Soviet Representative Has Not Yet Arrived

### Observation by American Reporter Stationed in the Soviet Union: Amity Between the US and the Soviet Union is Impossible; Soviet People are Pure, Hardworking, and Practical; There is Still Some Freedom Under a Dictatorial Government

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th Special Dispatch]: Atkinson, a special correspondent for the New York Times who has just returned to the United States from the Soviet Union, recently wrote that amity between the United States and the Soviet Union is not possible for several years, and that dealing with the Soviet government in a friendly way will inevitably lead to failure. In the first article, Atkinson said, "If we want to have a proper relationship with the Soviet Union, we must abandon some of the usual familiar concepts of friendship." He then explained that the meaning is "friendship" with close links to political compromise is not what we need. In fact, it is neither possible nor what is being discussed here. Because the Soviet government agency is a political tool, and the friendship between ordinary human beings is completely different. Atkinson concluded, "Although we are not enemies, we are not friends either. What we can hope for at most is to maintain armed peace for several years." According to Atkinson, generally speaking, "the Soviet people are respectable people, pure, hardworking, and practical, but unfortunately, there is a Soviet government between us and the Soviet people. After traveling in the Soviet Union for nearly a year, Atkinson observed that the dictatorship of the proletariat is actually the dictatorship of the thirteen members of the Politburo of the Communist Party. There is no freedom at all in the Soviet Union." When Atkinson was the special correspondent in Chongqing before being transferred to Moscow, he said that the Soviet government is accustomed to using force within the union, so it also has its instinctive concept of force in its diplomacy. At this point, Atkinson advocated that the United States also needs to use equal force, and said, "Where our interests lie, we must apply equal power on the opposite side. This is the most reactionary method of dealing with international affairs, but judging from the Soviet government's attitude towards the defeated countries and the behavior of the Soviet army in the three northeastern provinces, the fundamental spirit of its government is reactionary."

### Tanaka Ryukichi Recalls: On the Eve of July 7th, Using Anti-Communism as an Excuse to Create Autonomy

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th]: Former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Tanaka Ryukichi, continued to testify in the International Court today, saying that when Japan planned to establish autonomous regions in North China, it wanted to find an excuse. Finally, it was decided to adopt the slogan of "anti-communism." This was decided in 1935, and the Kwantung Army sent Doihara to Peiping. Tanaka avoided mentioning any aggressive intentions of Japan, and his answers intended to prove that the CCP guerrillas and anti-Japanese elements forced Japan to do so. When asked whether this action prompted the Kwantung Army and the Japanese army in North China to decide to establish an autonomous region in the five provinces of North China, Tanaka replied: This is one of the reasons for the anti-communist slogan. Half of Shanxi Province was occupied by the central government, and its purpose was to resist Japan and save the country. The central government and guerrillas made Manchuria uneasy. Japan wanted to set up a buffer zone to prevent the CCP army from entering Manchuria from the Chinese headquarters. Tanaka continued: Doihara and Doihara had a dispute over the issue of stationing troops in North China, and their friendship broke down; but the two had the same views on the issue of establishing autonomous regions in the five provinces of North China. The court asked whether Japan intended to create trouble in China? Tanaka replied sharply: "I said that the autonomy movement was intended to cause friction with China more than once." Tanaka made a favorable defense of Minami Jiro, the commander of the Kwantung Army at the time. At the same time, the defense counsel for defendant Hiranuma Kiichiro requested that Hiranuma be transferred from Sugamo Prison to Tokyo Imperial Hospital, but was rejected by Presiding Judge Webb.

### Seven Arab League Nations Send Memorandum to Britain and the United States, Requesting a New Status for Palestine Based on the Spirit of the United Nations Charter

[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] Following the Arab League Council meeting last month, each Arab nation individually sent a memorandum to Britain and the United States. The Arab League released this memorandum tonight, stating that the current status of Palestine must end and be replaced by a new status established according to the spirit and provisions of the United Nations Charter.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 8th] The Arab League issued a statement tonight in response to the American memorandum regarding the U.S. investigative report, stating: We feel that the Zionist policies will lead to a conflict of interest between the Arab East and the United States. The Palestine problem is not a result of Nazi persecution of Jews, but a direct consequence of Britain's erroneous policies since World War I. If the United States can comprehensively resolve the issue of racial persecution based on humanitarian principles, it will gain the widespread support of the Arab people.

### New American Weapon: Germ Warfare Successfully Developed; More Terrifyingly Destructive Than the Atomic Bomb; Reportedly Once Planned for Use in Attacking Japan

In this great era of ours, the success of germ weapons has once again increased people's terror. According to information obtained from congressional references, the Navy Department has successfully researched and developed secret weapons. The significance of this new weapon's successful research is not only international, but also cannot be ignored given the current situation in the United States. It should be stated here that the discovery and successful research of bacteria for use as weapons is not solely the work of the Navy Department. The United States has long had an independent institution dedicated to biological warfare testing. The destructive power of these biological weapons is more terrifying than that of the atomic bomb, yet its manufacturing is not as dangerous as that of the atomic bomb. In addition to the Army and Navy, many scientists and civil servants participated in this testing, the most important of whom is arguably Joe Muck.

Three Types of Effects

The effects of this weapon can be divided into three types: The first is that it has a potent toxin that can cause plague. Tests on animals have shown that the toxicity of this weapon can quickly and massively kill enemies at the beginning of infection. This toxin is extracted from a type of bacteria that is constantly reproductive and easily transferable. The seeds propagated by these bacteria can survive in the air or on the ground for a considerable period without the need for special cultivation or specialized equipment. In this situation, these newly generated seeds can be made into bombs and dropped, or carried into enemy territory by special agents and dispersed to trigger their toxicity. The second effect is that the toxicity of this weapon can also cause various malignant diseases in plants and animals.

Small Bomb, Great Toxicity

There have been rumors that this weapon was to be used against Japan in this manner. If the atomic bomb failed to force Japan to surrender after being dropped, a piece of this bacteria, the size of an ordinary pill, could completely poison a field of rice paddies. The original purpose of preparing to use this weapon against Japan was to cut off its food supply. The third effect is increased concentrated toxicity. When applied, it can affect a very large number of people. For example, if this concentrated toxic weapon is placed in the enemy's water source, everyone who drinks the water will be poisoned. If a toxic pill made from this bacteria is mixed into food, a slightly larger dose can kill the poisoned person within a minute. If the dose is smaller, it will cause vomiting and diarrhea. It is currently unknown how long it will take to recover after being poisoned by this toxin.

Bloodless Killing

Just a little thought about this new weapon reveals that it is revolutionary, with the same value as the atomic bomb. Naturally, the difference between this germ bomb and the atomic bomb is that it does not destroy the enemy's production facilities like the atomic bomb does, but rather it is absolutely effective in terms of its killing power; however, in military terms, its value is still inestimable because the effect of this weapon is a bloodless form of killing. This weapon can be made into a bomb or a small pill that can be carried into enemy territory and used. The most difficult problem is that it is much more difficult to control this weapon than the atomic bomb. The method of manufacturing an atomic bomb is very complicated and requires a lot of equipment; but what about biological weapons? According to an authority, it can be manufactured in an ordinary brewery.

Germ Bombs and Peace

These facts undoubtedly add to the responsibility on the shoulders of Mr. Baruch, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. None of the various methods currently used to limit the control of atomic energy can escape a basic conclusion. If the control of atomic energy is to be successful, then all participating countries must sacrifice a portion of their sovereignty. The method of atomic energy control proposed by Acheson requires each country to sacrifice the minimum amount of sovereignty. Baruch may ask each country to sacrifice more sovereignty. Baruch's recent trip to Washington was to conduct a final review of atomic energy control policies before formally submitting a recommendation to Truman. At present, if each country participating in this atomic energy control conference is willing to sacrifice a portion of its sovereignty to this control, then this international institution can truly take effect for a considerable period, using this effective international institution to solve international problems in a peaceful manner, eliminate mutual suspicion, and avoid repeating the mistakes of World War II. This is the ultimate goal of American policy. (Translated by the Central News Agency from the New York Herald Tribune, May 31)

### A Grand Plan to Expand Shanghai

Eight architects and engineers in this city, with the assistance of technical experts, have spent five months drafting a preliminary grand plan to expand Shanghai into a metropolis capable of accommodating 15 million citizens. This plan has now been submitted to the heads of various municipal departments for study, so that the municipal authorities can formulate a detailed work plan to transform Shanghai, with the first phase lasting five years. According to the preliminary plan, the city's commercial district will be expanded to Nanshi, and the intricate maze-like narrow streets of Nanshi will all be demolished and rebuilt. Hankou Road will be widened to become a secondary thoroughfare, with its western end running through the racecourse. A portion of the racecourse itself will be designated as the central location for civil administration agencies, with the remainder rebuilt into a park. Parks and sports fields will also be added throughout the city, with the area of parks for citizens to stroll in increasing with distance from the commercial district, to improve the health of citizens. The suburban area of Shanghai will be expanded to the shores of Taihu Lake and Zhapu on the edge of Hangzhou Bay. The main industrial area will be located near Yunzaobang in Wusong, and the main port will be located in Zhapu, in accordance with the teachings of the President, with a secondary port in the Wusong area. Pudong will be developed as a residential area, but nine-tenths of it will still be used for cultivation. According to the designers of the plan, the urban population of China accounts for about 5 percent. Based on the situation in other countries, the gradual industrialization of China could increase the urban population to 40 percent. The ideal population of Shanghai is around 25 million, but the area necessary to accommodate this huge population is currently less than one-tenth established. Therefore, Shanghai will have an excellent opportunity that other large cities have not had, to design new urban areas and perfect transportation on virgin land. For centuries, urban designers have only focused on planning on a grand scale, and have largely ignored the importance of rapid vehicular traffic in modern life. Therefore, Shanghai should open up main thoroughfares scientifically designed to be 200 meters wide, and secondary thoroughfares 70 meters wide, to meet the vehicular traffic on congested roads. The designers encountered great difficulties during this planning due to a lack of various statistics and surveys, but it was completed in five months, which is much faster than the urban planning design of London and New York, which took several years.

### Public Trial of Four Defendants in Assault and Injury Case during Parade; Charged with Obstructing Freedom and Causing Injury; Xu Damao and Zhu Jiangsheng Not Allowed Bail

[This newspaper] The case of "Publicly Trialing Spies" and obstructing the freedom of others, which occurred during the "June 13th" parade to see off "People's Representatives" Ma Xulun and others to Beijing and protesting the civil war, has been investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office and prosecuted. A public trial was held yesterday morning at the District Court. Many listeners came, mostly young students, and the Fourth Tribunal was almost unable to accommodate them. The trial was temporarily moved to the First Tribunal, and the opening time was delayed from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.

Of the four criminals, Xu Damao and Zhu Jiangsheng were in custody, while Diao Minzhi and Ruan Guangyu were out on bail. Yesterday, they reported for questioning. Plaintiffs Zhang Yong, He Xuechun, Yu Yinrong, and others filed ancillary civil suits and hired five lawyers: Duanmu Kai, E Miao, Yu Chuanding, Lu Jiayi, and Zhao Zuwei to appear in court. The defendants also hired three lawyers: Sha Qianli, Yu Zuoliang, and Zhu Shaowen to defend them.

### Prosecutor Fang States the Main Points of the Prosecution

The case was presided over by Judge Wu Shaochang. After taking the stand, he ordered the bailiffs to bring Xu and Zhu in, and Diao and Ruan stood together in the defendant's dock. After asking for their names, ages, and places of origin, Prosecutor Fang Zheng stood up and stated the main points of the prosecution: Defendants Zhu Jiangsheng, Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, and Ruan Xianyu, on June 23rd, due to the "People's Representatives" Ma Xulun and others going to Beijing to request peace, participated in a parade. While passing Henan Road, Lin Sen Central Road, the YMCA entrance on Xizang Road, and Fuxing Park, because the victims Yu Jinrong, He Xuechun, Zhang Yong, and others were distributing leaflets, the defendants Xu Damao, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Diao Minzhi beat them. Defendant Ruan Guangyu shouted encouragement in the background. Qiu Shengqing was also beaten and injured in front of the YMCA entrance. The victims Yu Jinrong, He Xuechun, Zhang Yong, and Qiu Shengqing were tied up with ropes and forced to march with the parade. At Fuxing Park, the victims Zhang Yong and others were imprisoned in trucks and guarded by the defendants Diao Minzhi and Zhu Jiangsheng. The police brought the defendants to justice and transferred them for interrogation. When the defendants Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, and Zhu Jiangsheng committed the assault, students Gu Qingzheng, Huang Jiaqing, and Li Zhaolin witnessed it and gave separate statements to the case. There is also the Nan Yang Hospital injury report submitted by the victims as evidence. The defendants Zhu Jiangsheng, Diao Minzhi, and Xu Damao are jointly charged with the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 302, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Defendant Ruan Guangyu is charged with Article 30, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for shouting encouragement and assault. In accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a joint prosecution is filed, requesting legal action be taken.

### Interrogation of the Defendants; All Four Deny the Charges

Xu Damao stated: 24 years old, working at the No. 1 Woolen Mill of the Central Textile Factory. He participated in the parade as a patrolman on that day. (Question) Why did you march? (Answer) To demand peace and send off the "People's Representatives." (Question) Why does the plaintiff say you beat him, and point out that you beat him in front of the YMCA? (Answer) The plaintiff mistook me. I don't even know where the YMCA is. (Question) How were you arrested? (Answer) After the meeting ended, I was riding a rickshaw back to the factory, passing Guiba Road. Because I had a patrol badge and a patrol stick, I was shouted at and taken to the police station by an unknown young man.

Zhu Jiangsheng stated: 29 years old, a teacher at a school, participating in a primary school teacher's joint training association. They hold a literary morning meeting at Yucai Middle School every Sunday. After arriving at the meeting on June 23rd, it was temporarily decided to postpone the meeting until next week. He immediately formed a team to participate in the parade, with the aim of stopping the civil war, demanding peace, and sending off the "People's Representatives." He knows nothing about the beating incident. (Question) How were you arrested? (Answer) I saw a large truck outside the park entrance. I heard that it was going to western Shanghai, so I jumped on for a ride. I didn't expect the car to drive to the Taishan Branch. Because I was wearing a patrol badge, Branch Chief Zhu called me down for a talk and I was detained. (Question) Was there a "spy" publicly tried in the park? (Answer) I only heard about it. (Question) Were there people on the car or on your body who were "written on"? (Answer) No. (Question) Were you serving as a guard during the public trial? (Answer) No. (Question) Did you hit or arrest anyone on Nanjing West Road and at the YMCA? (Answer) I was at the back of the team, I don't know anything.

Diao Minzhi stated: 19 years old, a second-year student at Lianhua Commercial Practical School. He was notified directly by the "Shanghai Students' Association for Peace" to go to the North Station to welcome the "Representatives." My job was to put up slogans. (Question) How were you arrested? (Answer) I picked up a camera case in Fuxing Park and wanted to find the person in charge to return it. After searching everywhere, I saw a truck and thought the person in charge was on the truck, so I jumped on the truck, and the truck immediately started. When it arrived at the Taishan Road branch, I was taken to the bureau. (Question) Did you see the plaintiff with the words "Spy" and "Bad Egg" written on his body? (Answer) I saw it, but the handwriting was unclear. I only saw a patch of black ink. The court then said, "There were many people distributing leaflets, why did you only grab him? There is no such coincidence that the car would start immediately after you jumped on." Diao could not argue at this point, so he held up two Boy Scout food bags and presented them to the court, saying: "This can prove that the two bags were for the people who posted slogans on that day." The court said: "This bag can also be used to put other things in, so it cannot be established as evidence." Again, (Question) The biggest reason why you arrested those people was because they were distributing leaflets and disrupting the team. Do you know what they said in the leaflets? (Answer) Oppose internal turmoil and demand peace. (Question) Since you are for peace and they are for peace, you are the same and want peace, then their distribution of leaflets cannot be called disruptive behavior, especially the distribution of leaflets cannot be called "National Special Agent." Diao blushed and said, "Yes, yes, yes, I am too young, I am too young."

Chen Guangyu stated: 18 years old, a third-year student at Gezhi Middle School. He came to participate in the parade. He went to the YMCA to watch a ball game, and he doesn't know how they got him to the police station. To this day, I don't know why.

### Three Plaintiffs Describe the Insults They Suffered

Zhang Yong stated: He has been working as an accountant at the YMCA for four or five years. On the afternoon of the 23rd, when he was reading a book in the library on the second floor, more than 20 people rushed in, holding wooden sticks and wearing patrol armbands. They claimed that they wanted to arrest people who were disrupting the team and distributing leaflets. He told them that the YMCA was a religious organization and that this would not happen. At that time, a tea servant in the dining room on the ninth floor was holding a leaflet he had picked up from outside and was reading it. He was accused of distributing leaflets and throwing foreign bottles and plates at the team from the ninth floor. They forcibly tried to take him away. He argued with them, saying that if they wanted to arrest someone, they should call the police to arrest them, and they should not use this method. He was then falsely accused of being a spy, pushed, and beaten. When he exited the gate, he was tied up and paraded. When he walked to Ma Lang Road, Lin Handa ordered: "National Special Agents" should be searched. His pens and other items were searched, and his clothes were stripped off. A female student walked behind him and wrote the words "Special Agent" on his back with paint. He was then escorted onto a truck to Fuxing Park. Lin Handa stood on the truck and said: "Now we have caught a 'National Special Agent', should we publicly try him?" There was then chorus of agreement. Later, the police sent people to the scene, and he followed them to the police station. The next day, he went to the Nan Yang Hospital for treatment. At that time, I did not find any leaflets. Xu Damao, one of the four defendants, was the one who hit me at the YMCA. Zhang also presented three pieces of dirty clothes painted with red paint on that day.

Yu Jinrong stated: He is a student at the Chinese Vocational School. He did not participate in the parade on the 23rd, but received five or six hundred leaflets from the Shanghai Students' Anti-Internal Turmoil Alliance and distributed them at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road. He was arrested, beaten, and had words written on his back. He was pulled onto a truck. At that time, Xu, Zhu, and Diao were all on the truck, and Xu was one of the people who participated in the beating.

He Xuechun stated: He is a student at the Sino-French Middle School. He did not participate in the parade on the 23rd. He distributed leaflets from the roof of the high-rise building where he lived on Lin Sen Central Road. He was arrested by a group of people who rushed up, and beaten while walking. When he arrived at Ma Lang Road, his pens, money, diary, and other items were searched and taken away. He was escorted onto the St. John's School bus, and ink was used to write words on his back. After entering Fuxing Park, a chief patrolman asked the public: "Now that we have caught a 'Special Agent', how should we deal with him?" Some people shouted, "Publicly try him," others shouted, "Beat him to death," and others shouted, "Execute him." Later, the police arrived, and they forced us to stand up three times to show the public, and threatened us that if we continue to engage in activities in the future, we should be careful. We were then sent to the police station. He also presented a piece of clothing that was torn at that time.

### Interrogation of Witnesses; Witnessing the Beating

Another plaintiff, Qiu Shengqing, was absent. Witness Huang Jiaqing was also absent. Two other witnesses, Gu Qinzheng and Li Zhaolin, were interrogated.

Gu stated: He participated in the anti-internal turmoil parade and also participated in the so-called "People's Representative" farewell parade on the 23rd. That day, while passing near the Xie Da Xiang cloth shop at the YMCA, someone said that there were "National Special Agents" in the YMCA. We surrounded and attacked. At that time, Lin Handa said to the crowd: "After they are caught, do we need to publicly try them?" The people below shouted, "Execute them," etc. They then escorted a person with a shaved head and wearing a Western suit surnamed Zhang from the YMCA. Later, someone next to me saw that I was holding propaganda, so they also pointed me out as a "National Special Agent" and grabbed me. They asked me if I was a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and I replied no. Because I had no documents, I was slightly beaten and then released. When I returned to the Anti-Internal Turmoil Alliance office to report, I went with several people to Fuxing Park to observe the "public trial" results. I was then transferred to the police station at the intersection of Bopu Road and Fuxu Road.

Li stated: A student at Zhengzheng Night School. After dinner on the 23rd, I was reading a book in the YMCA library when a crowd of paraders rushed in and started beating people. Ruan Guangyu was shouting and hitting from the side. Later, a person was taken away. Several hours later, I saw Ruan coming up and down in the elevator in the questioning office on the second floor, so I took Ruan to the police station. In this democratic era, there should not be such an incident of obstructing the freedom of others. The reason why I took Ruan to the police station was to find out who the real murderer was. The trial was adjourned at this point. The defense lawyers stood up and said: "The case files have not been read, and the defendants have not been interviewed. We will present rebuttal evidence next time." They also requested that Xu Damao and Zhu Jiangsheng, who are in custody, be released on bail. The court did not approve it. The case was adjourned to 9:00 AM on the 16th for further trial. Diao Minzhi and Ruan Guangyu remained on original bail. Xu Damao and Zhu Jiangsheng were returned to custody.

### Most of the German僑 (Overseas Chinese) Who Evaded Repatriation Have Been Arrested and Detained; Only Nine People Landed Temporarily

[This newspaper] There are about dozens of German Nazi Party members in this city who were in hiding to avoid being repatriated. It is now known that most of those who were in hiding have been arrested and detained by the relevant parties. It is heard that the list of those arrested is currently being compiled by the US military authorities. As to whether they should be sent to concentration camps for detention in the future, it must be determined after requesting instructions from the government authorities. In addition, of the first batch of Germans repatriated, nine people, including Li Men, Franz, Miss, Hiblitz, Heishe, Oberme, Roki, Hermann, and Andanqi, were approved by the Executive Yuan to stay here three hours before the "Robin" ship left Shanghai. However, the families and luggage of the nine people were taken back home because they could not be returned in time. Seven of the nine people are technicians and will join several agencies in this city to serve, while the two doctors Roki and Hermann will work in the hospitals of the Chinese Ministry of Health. In addition, three people, Asstedt, Lent, and Heiser, also requested to stay in China and were approved, but before they were ready to leave the ship, the ship had already set sail.

### The Plague is Terrible! Another High Record Set

[This newspaper] Yesterday, the number of cholera patients broke the highest record again, with 101 people! Seven people have died. A total of 1,545 people have been transported for treatment, with 102 deaths. According to the statistics of the Health Bureau, there are currently about 2,000 cholera beds, but according to the current spread, it is feared that they will soon be full again. Therefore, the health authorities urgently hope that the public will donate hospital sites, medicines, equipment, etc. It is also hoped that doctors and nurses in this city can cooperate voluntarily.

### Police Bureau Promotes Meritorious Personnel

[This newspaper] Director Xuan of the Municipal Police Bureau has promoted police officers who have repeatedly made meritorious contributions. Xia Guoliang, the deputy chief of the fire brigade, was promoted to chief of the brigade at his original rank. Zhou Guanghui, the chief of the criminal section of the Huangpu Branch, has repeatedly solved major cases, and has been given two major merits and promoted to the second level of appointed rank. Inspector Hong Zhang has been given one major merit and promoted to the fourth level of appointed rank, in order to encourage them.

### Smokers Tested for Toxicity and Sent to Police Stations for Compulsory Detoxification

[This newspaper] According to an announcement by the Police Bureau, the total number of registered smokers in this city is approximately 6,000. Starting from the first of this month, random inspections will be carried out. Those who are selected will be sent to the police hospital's addiction testing center for testing. As of yesterday, there were more than 100 people, of whom more than 10 people who were found to be toxic after testing were sent to the police station for compulsory detoxification.

### Broadcasting for Relief of Northern Jiangsu Refugees Achieves Success: A Play Dotted for 60 Million Yuan; Zhu Xiaofang's Enthusiasm is Admirable

Mr. Du Yuesheng, Director of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, requested all radio stations in the city to organize a broadcasting fundraising team. From the 8th to the 10th, they broadcasted for three days at Shanghai Radio Station, inviting famous amateur opera singers, celebrities, stars, singers, and performing artists to participate voluntarily. For the past two days, donations and requests for songs have been extremely enthusiastic. For example, famous amateur opera singer Huang Zhenshi and Mr. Du Yuesheng's daughters, the Misses Meiru and Meixia, earned donations of 10 million yuan. Yesterday, Mr. Zhu Xiaofang donated a three-story garden villa with five bays in Hangzhou, covering 1.6 mu of land, valued at 60 million yuan, and requested Ms. Shao Zhang Eyun to sing a play. The real estate will be publicly auctioned on the radio, and all proceeds will be donated to the association. The property deeds are stored at Mr. Zhu's office in Zhonghe Real Estate Company, Fuhu Building, Fuzhou Road. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively participate in the bidding to support this charitable cause together.

### Key Criminal in the Rong Desheng Kidnapping Case Negotiating Ransom Arrested in Longhua Temple; Careful Planning Afterward Shows He is an Old Hand; Two Packages of US Dollars Found Hidden Under Coal Baskets in Son-in-Law's Home

[Report from this Newspaper] The complexity of the Rong Desheng kidnapping case and the difficulty of solving it are unprecedented in this city. Although more than 20 criminals have been arrested by the military police, it is claimed by related parties that this is less than half of the total number of people involved in the case. According to reports from this newspaper, the arrest of Zheng Liantang (pictured), another key criminal responsible for negotiating the ransom procedures with the Rong family, also required considerable effort. Zheng had previously committed three kidnapping cases. In one case, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released after a general amnesty. In another case, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison after being arrested. The most recent case was on September 25th of last year, when he, instigated by Yuan Zhongzhu and others including Luo Wenqing, attempted to kidnap Zhu Linpu, the manager of Tianhe Money Exchange on Sijing Road in this city, but failed. Therefore, since the Rong case occurred, the military police authorities cooperated closely and learned that the main culprits were Yuan Zhongzhu and Luo Wenqing. Based on the clues, they began investigating. At that time, the Rong family was deeply afraid that the hostage would be killed, so all negotiations were kept secret. As a result, it was necessary to seek more information from other criminals. However, when the police sent personnel to Zheng Liantang's residence (next door to Jin Situ Temple on Kangtuo Road, Gordon Road), it was already empty. This further proved that Zheng must be an accomplice.

A few days after the Rong family was released, the police received intelligence that Zheng had received more than 40,000 US dollars in赃款from the case, which was now stored in the belly of a Buddha statue in Jin Situ Temple. Officers were immediately dispatched to the temple, where there was only an old nun. After questioning, she said that someone had indeed hidden a paper package in the belly of the Buddha statue, but she did not know what it was, and it had been taken away by "Sister-in-law Peide." When asked who "Sister-in-law Peide" was and where she lived, she said she did not know. Therefore, the police had to start with "Sister-in-law Peide." Soon, they finally learned that there was indeed a person named "Peide," who was Zheng's apprentice. He and his wife were arrested in Zhengjia Muqiao. After questioning, they confessed: "Zheng came to his residence two days ago, saying that the crackdown on adultery has been very strict recently. He himself had a past suspicion of being a collaborator, so he needed to avoid the limelight temporarily. He now has a package of important documents hidden in Jin Situ Temple, which he instructed his wife to quickly retrieve and send to the Jing'an Temple Road tram stop, to be handed over to a man holding a white fan and wearing white shoes, and also asked to pay attention to newspaper reports, etc." The police followed these clues step by step, and finally learned from "Peide" that Zheng was hiding in Longhua Temple. On the morning of July 5th, in the midst of wind and rain, they went to search the address. At that time, Zheng was still lying in the drum tower. He had originally planned to escape to another place that day, but stopped due to the rain, and was captured. According to his confession, the赃款was hidden in his son-in-law's home. The police found a package containing 10,000 yuan at the bottom of the coal basket, and another package containing 20,000 yuan elsewhere. According to his son-in-law's confession: Zheng told him that it was privately purchased opium and that he should not open it to avoid the smell from leaking out, so he never knew what it was. As for how Zheng was able to stay in Fahua Temple, the monks of the temple said that Zheng usually ate vegetarian food and chanted Buddha, and often came to the temple to burn incense, so they knew each other. This time, Zheng said that he had a family quarrel and came to the temple for a temporary stay to relieve his worries.

Furthermore, Zhan Rongpei (pictured), the factory director of Shenxin No. 2 Factory, who instigated the crime behind the scenes, was found by the police to have paid out 200,000 national currency before the Rong case occurred as capital for the kidnapping. The check he issued to Wu Zhigang has been traced.

### Luo Wenqing's Wife Also Arrested; More赃款Continues to be Recovered

Another report: Regarding the Rong case, Du Chunwen, the Director of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, received a tip-off that Luo Wenqing, the main culprit who had already been apprehended, had some赃款stored with his wife, Wang Cuiying. After Wang learned that Luo Wenqing had been arrested, she was deeply afraid of being implicated, so she handed over all the stolen goods in suitcases to her sister, Tang Wang, for safekeeping, and claimed to be going to Hangzhou to avoid the limelight temporarily, and fostered her two children. At that time, Director Du did not know the whereabouts of Luo's wife, but it was rumored that Feng Jingqing, the owner of Yumeichang Knitting Factory, knew the details. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Section Chief Zhou Guanghui, staff members Cao Yilan, police chief Zhao Hairu, and Dong Haishen went to the address of Shen Taihao at No. 3 Jiru Lane, Jixiang Street to investigate Yumeichang Knitting Factory and learned that Feng Jingqing lived at No. 8 Meicun Lane 1423, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. They immediately went to the address and arrested him. They then went to No. 12 Zhujia Bridge and arrested Tang Wang, and brought them both back to the bureau for interrogation. Wang confessed that the suitcases entrusted by her sister Wang Cuiying were currently stored at the home of Zhang Weiliang at No. 128 Zihua Road, opposite Houjiabang in the city. As for the house at No. 12 Zhujia Bridge, Feng Jingqing rented it on her behalf. Subsequently, the police officers went to the aforementioned location according to the confession and arrested the suspect Zhang Weiliang, who was storing the stolen goods, and seized a suitcase containing US$35,000 in banknotes and four gold rings, worth a total of 80 million national currency. Whether there will be further developments is currently under strict investigation.

### YMCA Luncheon: Mayor Discusses Grain Issues

[Report from this Newspaper] The YMCA of this city held a luncheon at the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday noon. Mayor Wu Guozhen also attended. During the luncheon, he made a speech on the recent rice market situation, stating that when he first took office, he believed that he could stabilize rice prices, but in fact, due to the complex environment of Shanghai and the machinations of hidden evil forces, the black market is still rampant. It is difficult to deal with some cunning rice merchants and organized scalpers. It has now been decided to allocate rice, although the quality is relatively poor, which may only be desired by lower-middle-class citizens. However, our greatest effort at present is to solve the livelihood of these common people. Wu also hoped that the "good people" in society could cooperate with the authorities.

### Zhang Xiaotong Died Tragically: Forced to Drink Poison, Strangled to Death, and Buried; Four Culprits Under Trial Still Attempt to Deny Everything

[Report from this Newspaper] Guo Menglin from Jiashan, Liao Keyun from Changzhou, Liu Bingyuan from Zhuan'an, and Tong Guozhong from Nantong, originally served under Su Nide in the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Party Headquarters. In 1939, Su betrayed the central government and joined the puppet regime's Special Operations Headquarters at No. 76, West Shanghai, and was transferred to be the Chief of the Nanjing District of the puppet department. They also joined the puppet regime and remained under Su. Guo Menglin served as the "Registration Section Chief" and the director of the internal detention center. Liao Keyun served as a member of the Investigation Section, Liu Bingyuan as the Chief of the Action Section, and Tong Guozhong as the Deputy Section Chief of the Investigation Section of the puppet department. In March 1940, Zhang Xiaotong, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, was arrested while working in Shanghai and sent to Nanjing, where he was imprisoned in the puppet detention center and killed by them. Su sent Guo, Liao, Tong, and Lü Beizhen (deceased) to secretly dig a deep pit near the roots of a tree on the Xuanwu Lake. Later, Su, together with Liu Bingyuan, escorted Xiaotong to the site by car. After asking if he had anything to say, Su took out a cup of poison and forced him to drink it. He immediately vomited and fainted. Guo Menglin and Lü Beizhen strangled him with a rope, and Tong Guozhong kicked his abdomen violently. After he died, Liao Keyun found a wooden door, and the four of them, Lü, Guo, Liu, and Tong, carried the body into the pit and buried it. Su gradually took photos and strictly prohibited anyone from disclosing the incident. However, our side learned of the secret, so after the victory, they were arrested and brought to justice one by one. But they still tried to deny everything, saying that they did not know about the incident at all, and claimed: "We sympathize with Zhang Xiaotong very much, but please ask the judge to investigate the real murderer." Liu Bingyuan even cried out "injustice" when answering questions, and even burst into tears when meeting his brother after the interrogation. His brother said that they had not seen each other for ten years, so he was moved to tears. However, he was stopped by the bailiff and sent back to prison within a few minutes.

### Retrial of Special Agent Pan Da: Two Victims Appear in Court to Testify

[Report from this Newspaper] The puppet government's special agent Shi Kui Pan Da was retried in the High Court yesterday. Pan Sansheng and Xia Zhongming were called to court to testify. Zhang Zhiwei and Tao Guisong, the victims, were also called to court to testify. According to Pan Sansheng's testimony: the house at No. 40 Jisi Feier Road, where Pan Da lived, was originally rented from the landlord Tao Guisong by Pan Sansheng, who then lent it to Pan Da. Xia Zhongming said that he did not know what Pan Da's job or work was. Tao Guisong testified that Pan Da lived in his house for more than two years, but only paid two months' rent. At that time, he was forced by Pan's power, so he dared not argue with him. Finally, Zhang Zhiwei was called to testify. According to his testimony: his brother Zhang Zhixin was arrested by Pan when the puppet government held a celebration in Zhaofeng Garden and imprisoned in the puppet West Shanghai Police Station, where he was tortured and died. Pan tried his best to deny this. The court hearing was adjourned to be retried. The head of the puppet Social Insurance Bureau was originally a postal worker in the Shanghai Postal General Bureau and a standing committee member of the Shanghai Postal General Bureau Union. Later, he was introduced to the puppet regime by Feng Yixian and presided over the workers' movement. He made great efforts to promote the puppet regime's party affairs, social affairs, and civil movement, and used the Three Principles of the People to incite social sentiment and train puppet party members, which was a serious crime. However, Zhang claimed that he did not harm the people, and had worked hard in social welfare and surrendered himself. After the defendant's lawyer defended him, the court decided to pronounce the verdict at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th.

### Minsheng Company Lost More Than 3 Billion in the Past Five Months; Lu Zuofu Went to Beijing Again Yesterday with Suggestions to Report to the Authorities

[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter recently visited Minsheng Industrial Company to inquire about the recent business development. It is understood that the company's current business is in a very distressed environment. The main reasons are: (1) During the Anti-Japanese War, the company assisted the country in transportation, and the government provided subsidies from time to time, which slightly made up for the losses. After the victory, the subsidies were cancelled, which had an impact on the company's financial adjustment. (2) Since the victory, all the company's ships have been ordered to transport grain, troops, and civil servants, with limited freight charges, while expenses have increased month by month, and revenue and expenditure cannot be matched, resulting in huge monthly losses. (3) All of the company's ships have never been thoroughly repaired in docks during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, and now all have passed the repair period, and it is difficult to repair them all. Currently, the repair costs for some of the ships have reached 4 billion yuan. (4) Although the Yangtze River ships are smaller than ocean liners and have less tonnage, they have very high horsepower and consume a lot of fuel, and the risk of sailing is also greater than that of ocean liners, and there are frequent unexpected repairs. However, the manpower and equipment on board are not less than that of ocean liners, so it is more difficult to maintain them. (5) The company has been operating the route from Yichang to Chongqing for 20 years, but recently a large number of technical personnel have been moving elsewhere, which makes it difficult for the company to cope. Mr. Lu Zuofu, the General Manager of the company, returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. According to people close to Mr. Lu: Mr. Lu visited Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications during his trip to Beijing and made some statements about the company's current situation. However, it is reported that no clues have been obtained. It is learned that Mr. Lu went to Beijing again yesterday, carrying a proposal for the future of the shipping industry, to report to the authorities. According to Mr. Lu, the company's total loss in the five months of this year reached more than 300 million, and the debt also increased to more than 300 million. Mr. Lu said that the procedures for borrowing money from Canada to purchase 18 ships have not been fully finalized, and he will need to go abroad in the near future.

### Continuous Rain Breaks 68-Year Record

### Few British Goods are Exported, and it is Difficult for Chinese Businesses to Order

[Report from this Newspaper] According to Mr. Hanmen, the secretary of the British Commercial Counselor, there are currently 140 British companies operating in Shanghai, most of which are companies that resumed business before the war, and only five or six new companies have been established, and they are not important.

Soon, more British businesses will resume business in Shanghai. The above 140 companies include the Shanghai British Business Electricity Company, the Water and Fire Company, the Royal Chemical Company, and the Gu Zhong Tobacco Company.

### UNESCO Secretary Advocates Dividing the World into Ten Regions

[Reuters, London, 8th] Dr. Kesley, Executive Secretary of UNESCO, presented a memorandum to the bureau's preparatory meeting today, advocating breaking the whole into parts by establishing branches of the bureau in various locations. He suggested dividing the world into ten regions: North America and the West Indies, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, the Middle East (including North Africa and Africa south of the Sahara), India (including Burma and Ceylon), the Far East, and Australia. A branch would be established in each region. He advised that care should be taken when planning and conducting work to prevent the bureau from being controlled by any one powerful nation.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] Dr. Somme Selte, the Norwegian representative to UNESCO, said: This organization should concentrate all its efforts on completing one project, instead of reaching too high and far. For example, the illiteracy eradication program is a worthwhile endeavor.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Civil Affairs Bureau Orders Districts to Distribute National Identification Cards Door-to-Door; Citizens Who Have Not Yet Received Cards May Apply at Any Time

With the exception of the 11th District, which has not yet completed the process, and the 12th District, where the district government offices have been sealed off by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, preventing timely distribution, all other districts in the city have completed stamping national identification cards. The Civil Affairs Bureau has issued them to the district government offices for distribution to residents. It is learned that the Civil Affairs Bureau also intends to issue nine points for attention to the district government offices for compliance regarding this work.

(1) The stamped identification cards should be distributed door-to-door immediately by the neighborhood administrators in conjunction with the block leaders, and should not be kept for citizens to pick up themselves, in order to expedite the process. (2) If the cardholder is traveling elsewhere or has other reasons for needing to wait for a period of time to pick up the stamped identification card, it should be turned over to the district government office for safekeeping and should not be kept at the neighborhood office. (3) If the cardholder is deceased, has moved elsewhere, or for other reasons cannot be issued the stamped identification card, a list should be compiled and the identification card returned level by level to the bureau for verification and cancellation. (4) Foreigners who have obtained Republic of China nationality or have naturalized in China according to law are eligible to receive national identification cards, but must submit their documents to the district government office for special processing and stamping. The circumstances and timing of obtaining nationality or naturalization should be noted in the remarks column of the identification card, and the original nationality should not be entered in the nationality field.

(5) After the first issuance of national identification cards, those who become legally eligible to apply for national identification cards must be urged to complete the application form at any time, follow the prescribed procedures, and submit a formal request to the bureau for stamping. If there are a large number of applications, an index should be included. This verification work should be done as it comes, without waiting to accumulate a certain number or process it in batches, in order to expedite the process. (6) If a citizen who applied for a national identification card during the first issuance lost it while it was being stamped, resulting in not receiving it, they should be urged to complete a supplementary application form and identification card, attach a list, and submit it to the bureau for verification and stamping. (7) If a citizen who has already received a national identification card moves, they should submit the identification card along with the relocation application form to the local neighborhood administrator, who will forward it to the district head/household registration director for registration of the new address in the "Change of Address Registration" section of the identification card and return it after stamping with the district head's name.

(8) If a stamped identification card has a photograph that has fallen off due to improper adhesion, the cardholder should be instructed to submit a replacement photograph, which will then be sent to the bureau for restamping. (9) If identification cards from District A are mixed in with those of District B due to carelessness during the stamping process, they must be sorted out and sent to the bureau for redistribution.

Furthermore, citizens aged 14 and above who have not applied for a national identification card should immediately complete an application. Those who subsequently move into the city with the intention of residing permanently, who apply for registration or have resided for more than one month, may apply for a national identification card at the local neighborhood office at any time.

### Authorities Determined to Eradicate the Black Market; Regulations Set Maximum Retail Price for White Rice; Subsidized Rice to be Distributed by District Starting Tomorrow; Five Sheng Per Person Available Upon Presentation of Household Registration

[Reported by this newspaper] The Grain Price Review Committee held its first meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Representatives from rice shops, including Qu Zhenhua and Zhang Xichao, rice dealers, including Yang Jiuzi, and bean and rice operators, including Wang Bingkun and Gu Yisheng, attended. The meeting was presided over by Ji Mingqi, Chief of the Grain Section, to discuss the price of white rice. The representatives brought various rice samples for reference. The meeting decided on the following prices for white rice: top-grade white *geng* rice, 65,000 yuan; slightly lower-grade rice, a bit less; *yangjian* rice, 65,000 yuan; *buyou* rice, 62,000 yuan; *baodao* rice, 65,000 yuan; milled *you* rice, 58,000 yuan; white *you* rice, 56,000 yuan.

About 20 rice shops in the north and south markets and in the city will have white rice for sale starting today. The price cannot exceed the above limits, and the final price, plus the legitimate profit margin of the rice shop, cannot exceed 71,000 yuan.

The Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau also has 5,000 *dan* of Brazilian rice, which will be allocated at a limited price to rice shops that have applied to the Social Affairs Bureau. Groups and factories can apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for purchasing certificates to purchase directly from other locations.

### Rice Shops to Sell Subsidized Rice; District Government Offices to Assist in the Process

A meeting on subsidized rice sales was held at the municipal government yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, chaired by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government. Ji Mingqi, Chief of the Grain Section, gave a report on the recent rice situation. Representatives from more than 22 district government offices attended. The meeting decided that each district should assist in the authorities' efforts to sell subsidized rice. It was stipulated that at least three rice shops in each district must sell subsidized rice. In order to prevent black market scalpers and to completely eradicate the black market, the following three concrete measures for purchasing rice were resolved: (1) Citizens must purchase rice based on their household registration certificate. After use, the rice shop will stamp it to prevent fraud and hoarding. (2) Each person is limited to purchasing no more than five *sheng* of rice at a time, and it was decided that purchases can only be made once every five days, so that each person can purchase an average of one *sheng* per day (e.g., a family of five can purchase two *dou* and five *sheng* of rice every five days). (3) When rice shops retail, neighborhood administrators and district representatives will supervise at all times. The above decisions will be implemented across the board starting tomorrow.

It is learned that the municipal government has ordered the police bureau to assist the Social Affairs Bureau in strictly cracking down on rice shops that do not sell allocated rice in accordance with regulations and to strictly prohibit black market scalpers from buying allocated rice to sell on the black market. The police bureau will reportedly dispatch police officers to rice shops distributing rice every day to maintain order. Anyone who attempts to purchase rice without a household registration certificate will be treated as a black market scalper and strictly detained. Citizens without household registration certificates should apply to their neighborhood administrator for a certificate in accordance with regulations.

It slightly decreased, and after 10:00 AM, it dropped below 18.9 million. The Central Bank distributed 12 bars at a price of 18.85 million, and it became even more stagnant afterwards. It stabilized somewhat near noon, approaching the 19 million mark. In the afternoon, the US dollar suddenly became popular, boosting demand and rising back to around 19.2 million. As a result, it closed up 25,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were 200,400, and silver bullion and silver dollars were both flat. The secret commissions ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 *jiao*. The money market continued to loosen.

The initial rate for foreign currency, US dollars, was flat and stable, very mediocre. It retreated from 2,370 yuan to 2,320 yuan when the market opened, and stabilized somewhat near noon, rising to over 2,360 yuan. In the afternoon, the supply dried up, and as soon as demand increased, it rose immediately. Talk of 100 yuan resurfaced. As a result, it closed up 80 yuan. The swap rate for gold was squeezed to around 784 yuan for ten *liang*. The Hong Kong dollar was stable after a flat start, and closed up 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 525 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 635 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 8,500 yuan. Supply still exceeded demand, and trading was sluggish. The US exchange rate remained [blank].

### Public Bonds Rise

Public bonds continued to see new activity, and short positions were squeezed again. Unified Class C rose from 600 yuan, hovering and rising, and finally approached the 800 yuan mark. The trend revived, which was quite unusual. As a result, it closed up 200 yuan compared to the previous close. Classes A and B also rose 130 yuan, Class D rose 100 yuan, and Class E also rose 150 yuan.

### *Hong* and White Tung Oil Show No Improvement

The white tung oil market has seen a slight improvement recently due to changes in domestic sales, but exports are becoming increasingly unprofitable and have been temporarily suspended pending price adjustments.

The current selling price for white tung oil is 77,000 to 78,000 yuan. Old brands of *Xifu Hongjiang* oil are around 80,000 yuan per barrel, slightly down to 74,000 to 75,000 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Rise Then Fall; Foreign Stocks Have a Dim Future, Trading is Scarce

The gains and losses of medium-sized stocks were minor, while small, unpopular stocks were flat. Veteran stocks were extremely bleak, with more sell orders than buy orders.

Trading in foreign stocks was significantly reduced. The stock exchange's resumption of trading lacked clear regulations for foreign stocks, causing disappointment among holders and shrinking buying interest. With any sell orders, dangerous situations arose. The decline was in order of coldness and heat. Jardine Matheson was the most fearful and weary. Smaller stocks were still mediocre. As a result, only steel was flat. Jardine Matheson fell by 15%. Paper, Asia, Guangyi, and beer were all slightly down. Ewo and the British Alliance fell into flatness.

### Yarn Prices Plummet

The yarn market plummeted significantly yesterday. From the opening to the close of trading, it was completely dominated by sell orders. Traders rushed to sell before others, and factories lowered prices drastically. 20-count *Shuangma* yarn plummeted by 120,000 to 130,000. Small and medium-sized 20-count and 16-count yarn also followed suit, falling by 30,000 to 50,000.

### Leasing Livestock Market; Forming Joint Venture; Request from Fresh Pig Industry Association

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the municipal government ordered the revocation of the livestock market, it has been closed and managed by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the original equipment of the livestock market is quite complete. Recently, due to the special situation in northern Jiangsu, the transportation of pigs has been difficult, and the pig pens in Wusong and Yunzaobang are poorly equipped. The City's Fresh Pig Industry Commercial Association believes that the livestock market has equipment for boiling oil and quarantining diseased pigs, making it the best pig pen in the city. The association has recently submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to lease the original site and equipment of the former livestock market, and that the industry would form a joint pig pen. It is reported that preparations will begin as soon as approval is granted.

### Struggling Banks and Firms are Taking Steps to Adjust; The Liquidity Crunch Seems to Have Passed

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Shanghai financial market suffered heavy blows from the sharp drop in the price of Unified Bonds and the period-end settlement at the end of June, the Daya Bank failed first. On the 4th and 5th of this month, market liquidity tightened sharply, and as a result, several financial institutions were threatened. Rumor has it that Dunyu Qianzhuang has been offered to Yangzi Jianye Company. Dakang Bank has been offered to Great Wall Bank. A small number of those with insufficient liquidity have also been trying to bring in powerful figures to reorganize. However, according to news from the clearing house, liquidity among the clearing banks has been easing since last Saturday. The total amount of deposits in the clearing house has reached 3 billion yuan. Therefore, it is believed that the financial turmoil has passed. Yesterday, the reporter asked Mr. Li Lixia, Director of the Business Inspection Department of Financial Institutions of the Central Bank, about the financial turmoil. According to him, the financial turmoil was not as serious as rumored outside. In total, there are more than 300 large and small financial institutions in Shanghai, and only three to five have had problems. The Central Bank's position is not to take any measures in the financial market unless absolutely necessary. Especially in the case of this event, assisting would be to reward these institutions. Mr. Li then cited the example of the turmoil in the financial market in Chongqing from the end of August to mid-September last year. At that time, because the impact was too great, the Central Bank stepped in to maintain the market, and the crisis finally subsided. Mr. Li concluded that the speculative atmosphere in Shanghai has always been stronger than elsewhere. He hopes that financial institutions will operate their businesses with stability as the main goal.

### Yongqing Qianzhuang Reopened Yesterday

Chongqing Yongqing Qianzhuang, founded by Lai Shanducheng in 1924, with a wolf's ambition, established its Shanghai branch in 1931. It withdrew automatically after the Anti-Japanese War and reopened yesterday at 108 Ningbo Road.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Cloth Market Weak: The cloth market continued to be weak due to stagnant demand and tight credit, making it difficult for the market to improve. The textile company's opening sale continued to supply V-brand at 53,500 yuan, down 500 yuan from the previous period. The rest was flat, but *Shilin* cloth from the Sichuan region had some purchasing activity, making the situation slightly better.

Raw Cotton Sales Brisk: Yesterday's New York American cotton telegram reported that due to inflation, prices soared 98 to 100 points per pound, with near-term cotton at US$32.06, forward cotton at US$32.30, and spot Midling cotton at US$32.71. Local raw cotton trading is becoming more brisk. The textile company handled 2,000 bales of Midling cotton, and private yarn factories such as Sulun, Jiafeng, Defeng, and Zhenxin also had considerable demand. Market prices rose another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

Hardware Sales Stagnant: Large quantities of Elephant brand shellac have recently arrived from the United States, but the quality is similar to the previous batch, and it is feared that it will still be difficult to get a good price. Many blue *hezi* belt buckles have also arrived, with prices only reaching 8,000 yuan per *he*, compared to local factory goods. The previously popular Rongchang belt buckles have faded, and no one is asking about them. The crisis in the industrial sector is becoming more serious.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Official Discusses the Soaring Sugar Prices: Direct Sales to Citizens May Begin Next Week

[Report from Our Newspaper] The recent surge in sugar prices has drawn widespread concern, and there has been much commentary on the operations of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Our reporter therefore paid a special visit yesterday to Mr. Song Yixin, the manager of the corporation's department, who explained that the Far East's sugar production centers have historically been in the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Due to factors such as land, climate, and labor, prices varied among these regions. Before the war, Java sugar was about three US cents per pound, while Philippine sugar was more than five cents per pound. China's annual sugar demand, excluding the Northeast, was a substantial 600,000 to 800,000 tons, mostly purchased from the Dutch East Indies, with Jardine Matheson & Co. acting as the agent. As for Taiwan sugar, it was never imported before the war due to its high price. Even if small quantities occasionally appeared, they were smuggled in by the Japanese. Philippine sugar was all shipped to the United States tax-free, so China also did not import it.

Taiwan Sugar's Production and Sales

Taiwan's sugar industry, after repeated encouragement from the Japanese, did increase its production. Although initial annual production was only 300,000 tons, by 1939 it had jumped to a peak of 1.4 million tons annually. The main reason for this increase was the forced labor system implemented by the Japanese. Production decreased slightly in the following two years. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the Japanese, fearing food shortages, reduced sugarcane cultivation in Taiwan and increased the planting of miscellaneous grains. Sugar production thus drastically decreased, and by the time China took over, annual production had fallen to a low of 200,000 to 300,000 tons. The actual sugar stock at the time was 150,000 tons. From December to mid-March, another 90,000 tons of sugar were produced from existing sugarcane. Therefore, when the Taiwan Sugar Corporation began operations, it only had 240,000 tons on hand. Currently, the people of Taiwan are unwilling to plant sugarcane because rice can be harvested two or three times a year in Taiwan's climate, while sugarcane requires 18 months to harvest only once. Therefore, it is estimated that next year's production will probably be no more than 30,000 to 40,000 tons. Together with the company's existing 240,000 tons, this makes a total of 270,000 to 280,000 tons, which must sustain domestic sales for 18 months. The difficulties are numerous. Therefore, although Taiwan sugar can come to Shanghai, it is premature to say that it can defeat foreign sugar. The government deeply hopes that sugar from Cuba and other places can be imported continuously to alleviate the panic, because the 1.5 million tons of sugar accumulated in the Dutch East Indies over the past few years have been completely destroyed in the recent civil war. Java today also relies on imports to meet its sugar needs and has no possibility of selling to China.

Four Rounds of Sales

When the company was first established, it planned to ship 10,000 tons to Shanghai each month. However, due to various reasons, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had difficulties with its ships, so by July 2nd of this year, only 6,000 tons had arrived. The rising sugar price is mainly due to transportation issues. The company was established on May 1st and began distribution on the 24th. The distribution method was to group 50 bags together, which sugar trade association members would then apply to purchase. Distribution occurred once a week. In the first round, 1,000 tons were sold at 66,000 yuan per 100 catties. In the second round, 1,300 tons were sold at the same price. In the third round, 1,200 tons were sold at 66,500 yuan per 100 catties. All sugar merchants were able to purchase the full amount they applied for, with profits of approximately 10% to 15%. When the fourth round of deliveries (June 13th) occurred, the sugar merchants were informed that the company was having transportation difficulties and insufficient stock. Knowing that there were profits to be made, the amount of their applications suddenly increased to more than 4,500 tons, exceeding the company's stock by a large amount. It was then agreed with the sugar trade association to proportionally reduce the amount based on the average amount requested in the previous three rounds, and 900 tons were sold. Sugar merchants established after June 8th were refused sugar in order to prevent speculation. At that time, the market price had risen to 81,000 yuan. In order to protect national interests and prevent sugar merchants from making excessive profits, the company increased the sugar price to 73,000 yuan per 100 catties. As a result, the sugar merchants who could not buy sugar complained and focused their criticism on the company, saying that it was "not selling sugar." At the same time, the sugar price rose to 120,000 yuan per dan. The company had no choice but to ask the sugar trade association's brokers to sell directly in the market starting from June 20th, because the company did not have the authority to sell sugar at the association without going through the association's brokers. Furthermore, if the company's staff went to sell the sugar themselves, how could they avoid suspicion of bias and favoritism? Each bag of sugar cost more than 100,000 yuan, while the brokers only received a commission of 250 yuan per bag. If it is said that this 250 yuan commission increased the burden on the sugar merchants, then the increase can be said to be extremely small.

The company then received a telegram from Taiwan stating that a sugar ship would arrive in Shanghai around June 23rd. On June 25th, it sold all of its remaining sugar (800 tons) at a price of 98,000 yuan per dan. And because it was certain that goods would be arriving, it also sold 3,000 tons of futures contracts at 95,000 yuan per dan. Unexpectedly, just as the goods were about to arrive, people's expectations turned bearish, and sales decreased sharply due to tight credit conditions. Therefore, the sugar merchants still have 30,000 to 40,000 bags that have not been collected, and currently there are those who are opposing price drops, fearing further losses.

Preferential Measures for Sugar Merchants

In fact, the company has been working hard to protect the interests of the sugar merchants. All association members who purchase sugar receive a 1% discount and an additional two catties of sugar per bag. For those who sell and transport sugar to other ports, the company also assigns staff to handle license procedures on their behalf. Therefore, it is hoped that all sugar merchants can be self-aware and, on the one hand, ask the government to encourage Chinese people to purchase sugar from foreign countries so that China can resolve the serious sugar shortage that is coming soon.

Possible Direct Sales

Mr. Song also said that starting next week, the company will receive orders from superiors and there may be changes to the distribution method. Mr. Song also hinted at the possibility of cooperating with the municipal government to directly distribute sugar to citizens.

Yesterday, the head office of Taiwan Sugar Corporation came to discuss and explain the handling process and policies, which were consistent with the above, so they will not be repeated here. Reporter

### Shanghai Municipal Public Works Retrospect and Prospect (Continued) (Conclusion)

— Zhao Zengjue

Regarding Gas

Regarding gas, according to statistics from May of this year, the average daily output of the Shanghai Gas Company, a British-owned enterprise in the city, was 3,750,000 cubic feet. The average daily output of the Wusong Gas Plant was 60,000 cubic feet, for a total of 3,810,000 cubic feet. The total number of users of both plants was 19,615 households, with an average daily usage of approximately 200 cubic feet. However, gas usage in summer is approximately 11% less than in winter, and gas supply will become even more problematic in winter. Therefore, how to increase the gas output of the gas companies is the most pressing issue at present. The following is a brief discussion of both temporary and permanent solutions:

(1) First, regarding temporary solutions, they can be divided into two parts:

(A) Urge the Shanghai Gas Company (British-owned) and the Wusong Gas Plant to jointly supply gas to residents in the Hongkou area in the eastern district. This requires the installation of transportation stations and gas storage tanks. The detailed design is currently being studied and planned by the plant.

(B) The Shanghai Gas Company (British-owned) and Zhao Zengjue, the director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, studied the possibility of using Indian coal. According to the general composition of Indian coal, the fixed carbon content is approximately 45%, volatile matter 40%, sulfide 1%, and water and ash content are quite low, approximately 1% and 13%, respectively. This is less than other types of coal, which contain 5% water and 15-22% ash. Transportation can reduce weight, and because it contains more fixed carbon and volatile matter, it can increase daily production by one million cubic feet. It also encouraged the company to add water gas equipment to achieve the purpose of supply.

However, before the output of the Shanghai Gas Company (British-owned) and the Wusong Gas Plant increases, all gas users in the city should save as much as possible and avoid unnecessary consumption.

(2) Now, regarding permanent solutions:

The heat energy of the gas supplied by the gas company is only 350 BTU per cubic foot, because the quality of the coal is poor. The coal currently used is Kai Zao coal. Zhongxing coal is more suitable, and Indian coal is of course better. If we can use suitable coal, the heat energy of the coal per cubic foot can be increased to 400 BTU, because we buy gas not for the gas itself, but for the heat energy.

Gas is the most economical and clean fuel, and it also has valuable by-products.

Regarding the city's gas industry in the future, it is necessary to actively expand and complete a complete high-pressure gas grid to meet the needs of the metropolis and its people. The city may be divided into three districts: (A) Wusong Zhabei district, which is supplied by the Wusong Gas Plant. (B) The former French Concession and the former International Settlement area, which is supplied by the Shanghai Gas Company (British-owned). (C) The Nanshi district, where a new plant will be set up separately to be responsible for the supply. The managers of each plant should maintain close contact with each other to avoid hindering the supply of people's livelihoods.

Wharves and Warehouses

The wharves currently under the jurisdiction of the bureau, in addition to the small wharves along the Suzhou River, include the 15 Bund wharves owned by the former Shanghai Municipal Council, the 6 astronomical observatory wharves owned by the former French Municipal Council, and the 6 wharves left by the former Japanese army, for a total of 27 wharves. Among them, 5 wharves are occupied by the US Navy, 2 wharves are occupied by the Customs, 1 wharf is occupied by the Post Office, 1 wharf has already sunk, 1 wharf is occupied by the Water Police, and 1 wharf is used for city ferries. Only 16 wharves can actually be used.

The Bund wharves of the former Shanghai Municipal Council were short and small, and before the war, they were only used for berthing iron lighters and small ferries. The wharves of the former French Municipal Council were only used for berthing wooden lighters and motorized boats. Now, due to the shortage of wharves, most ships are berthed at the Bund wharves.

According to statistics from May, a total of 2,572 iron lighters and ships, totaling 332,064 tons, were berthed at the above 16 wharves. (Wooden lighters and sailing boats are not included.) On average, 83 ships totaling over 10,700 tons were berthed daily. It is obvious that the burden on the 16 wharves to accommodate such a large number of ships cannot meet the current environment.

In order to provide emergency relief, we are preparing to promote the following matters as soon as possible:

(1) Restore the Nanshi Wharf: Before the war, there were 11 wharves in Nanshi. Only 6 wharves left by the enemy remained at the time of takeover, and they exceeded the dredged channel line by approximately 70 feet, which was not in accordance with the regulations. It is now planned to adjust the location of the above wharves and the existing wharves, for a total of 11 wharves. After the adjustment, 11 new wharves will be built on the vacated location.

(2) Cooperate with shipping companies or provide loans to build wharves and warehouses: As an emergency measure, it is planned to designate a certain amount of public land in a suitable location along the Pu River to cooperate with shipping companies to invest or borrow from financial institutions to build a certain number of wharves and warehouses to meet the needs.

### Adjusting Prices

As for the permanent solution plan, it must also be coordinated with the Shanghai urban construction plan and designed precisely based on the port layout. In general, all future wharves and warehouses should be concentrated in the following locations:

(1) The area from Jiangwan Qiujiang Wharf to Wusong Town should be designated as a deep-water port area for berthing ocean-going ships in order to transship domestic and foreign goods and supply the factories in the area.

(2) The Riyuegang port connects to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and is used as a medium-sized shallow-water port, specifically for the import and export of coastal vessels and industrial raw materials.

(3) The wharf near the Hefeng Shipyard in Pudong will be constructed after Pudong prospers.

(4) The area from the mouth of the Suzhou River to Caojiadu has many factories, and the area should be arranged as a shallow-water port with wharves and warehouses.

The construction of the above wharves should have new-style wharf equipment. The loading and unloading of materials at each wharf should be classified and grouped, such as coal, grain, machinery, and oil, which should be loaded and unloaded in separate areas. The equipment should be the latest model, according to the nature of the goods being loaded and unloaded.

Commodity prices in the city continue to rise, and wages have increased sharply. The income and expenses of various public utility companies cannot be balanced, and none of them are losing money. This phenomenon not only makes investors hesitate to move forward, but also prevents the expansion of the business. Even the repair of existing equipment and the maintenance of normal operations will be impossible. In addition to accepting the company's request for reasonable adjustments, there is simply no other way.

Since the Bureau resumed operations, it has made three adjustments to the prices of public utilities, but all of them have adopted the method of taking into account the burden on small users and saving on large users. After careful calculation, we strive to be reasonable. The situation is roughly as follows:

(1) Electricity price: It is determined according to the rate of increase in coal prices. When adjusting prices last year, it was stipulated that when the coal price increases or decreases by 1,000 yuan per ton, the electricity price at all levels can increase or decrease by 2 yuan. Therefore, at the end of March and the beginning of April of this year, the allocated coal price increased to 29,970 yuan per ton, which was more than 13,000 yuan higher than before. It was approved to add 26 yuan to each kilowatt-hour of electricity at all levels, and other factors were temporarily ignored.

(2) Approval of water prices: First, the cost calculation books opened by various companies were collected and studied comprehensively. The minimum amount of materials and the lowest prices were used to calculate that the water price must be 120 yuan per cubic meter, so this number was used as the approved price.

(3) Determination of gas prices: First, all factors related to the selling price were listed in a fixed calculation formula, and then the current accurate prices of each factor were investigated and substituted into the formula to calculate a reasonable price. Based on the results of this calculation, the approved adjustment price was 400 yuan per unit.

(4) Streetcars and buses: Because the company's losses were too large, not only could old cars not be repaired, but also normal maintenance costs could not be maintained. Vehicle damage and lack of funds for repairs created a more serious situation, so a relatively generous price must be set. Streetcar first class: 90 yuan to 200 yuan, third class: 60 yuan to 100 yuan, trolley bus: 90 yuan to 180 yuan, bus: 100 yuan to 300 yuan. However, after the adjustment, it was stipulated that each company must set aside a considerable amount of money to rush to repair old cars, so that all vehicles can serve the public in a short period of time. At the same time, in order to take into account the burden on civil servants of municipal administrative organs and teachers and students of schools, each company was ordered to issue half-price monthly tickets to show preferential treatment.

(5) Telephone prices: Because the current call volume is overloaded, all equipment is difficult to cope with, and it is not easy to purchase new equipment for a while. In order to ensure that the company's revenue and expenditure are balanced and to guide citizens to use the telephone sparingly, a progressive charging method is adopted. That is, the fee for the number of calls within the specified limit is very low, and the fee for exceeding the limit is increased proportionally, so that small users with fewer calls will not be excessively burdened. The company can increase considerable income to make up for accumulated losses. (After the adjustment, the telephone fee is 25 yuan per call on average within 100 calls per month, 50 yuan per call above 100 calls, 100 yuan per call above 200 calls, 150 yuan per call above 300 calls, and 200 yuan per call above 400 calls. Public telephones are 100 yuan per call.) Public utilities should be based on service as a prerequisite, but they must also take into account the maintenance of their business. If the business is suspended, the loss and suffering suffered by the public will be even greater. Therefore, we must not ignore the burden on the public, and we must reach a compromise under the principle of taking both sides into account. As of now, the prices of water, electricity, gas, streetcars, and buses in Shanghai are cheaper than anywhere else in China.

### Several Questions Amidst the Anti-Epidemic Efforts

— Bo Gan

Cholera is becoming increasingly rampant. According to the figures released by the Health Bureau, the number of patients and deaths is increasing daily. As of the 2nd of this month, there have been 1,034 patients, a figure that has reached half of the record of the major epidemic in 1926 (Year 15 of the Republic of China). Moreover, according to the usual situation in previous years, the current season has not yet entered the cholera season, or is only the beginning of the cholera season. Furthermore, according to experts' records of past cholera epidemics, Shanghai may indeed reach the cholera cycle this year. Therefore, we are urgently worried about cholera. We hope that all of Shanghai will work together to eradicate this terrible epidemic, and at the same time pay special attention to the various measures taken by the health authorities in terms of epidemic prevention.

The Shanghai health authorities believe that they have an unshirkable responsibility for epidemic prevention, and this attitude is truly admirable. But how many solutions the health authorities actually have, please see the following description:

First, regarding the vaccine issue. We remember that when the takeover began last September, cholera once occurred in Shanghai. At that time, the health authorities publicly declared that Shanghai's cholera vaccine could supply the entire city, with plenty to spare. According to common sense, Shanghai is a commercial and industrial center, and the affiliated areas of this center will naturally rely on Shanghai for items such as vaccines. In other words, Shanghai has the obligation to supply vaccines to its affiliated areas. Furthermore, from the perspective of epidemic prevention needs, in this era of frequent transportation, Shanghai and the surrounding cities are interconnected, and the boundaries cannot be self-drawn. If cholera is prevalent around Shanghai, then Shanghai will also find it difficult to guarantee its safety. If the surrounding cities need assistance in epidemic prevention, the Shanghai health authorities should generously consider it, and should not categorically refuse it. We know that the Shanghai Health Bureau has in the past supplied vaccines produced by the bureau to other provinces and cities. From this, we infer that the city's vaccine supply is not only sufficient, but indeed has a surplus. However, at this moment of tense epidemic situation, we suddenly heard that the Health Bureau prohibited the sale of vaccines to other places on the pretext of resisting the war. People believe that such measures should not be taken unless there is a shortage of inventory in the city. At the same time, therefore, we doubt: Is the vaccine produced by the Health Bureau itself sufficient for the bureau to carry out epidemic prevention work? Is the vaccine produced in Shanghai sufficient to meet Shanghai's needs without fear of shortage? The Health Bureau must have an accurate calculation on this. If the calculation results show that there is no shortage, then this calculation should be made public.

Second, regarding the issue of hospital beds. The number of cholera patients is increasing day by day, and several isolation hospitals are all overcrowded. According to a report on the 1st of this month, there are a total of 590 isolation beds in the city: 250 beds in the Municipal First and Second Infectious Disease Hospitals, 150 beds in the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital, 20 beds in the Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital, 100 beds in Guangci Hospital, and 70 beds in the Emergency Epidemic Hospital. Among them, except for Guangci Hospital, which still has more than 20 empty beds, all other hospitals have declared themselves full. The Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital has a particularly large number of patients because of its central location and historical significance. It is estimated that on the 2nd of this month, the hospital had a total of 148 inpatients and 682 outpatients. Some cholera patients, when sent to the hospital, have to be injected for a while and then sent back immediately because there are no beds available. The shortage of beds is evident here. The health authorities must be very clear about this point. We have also heard that the Health Bureau is applying for funds to build mobile wooden houses donated by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and we have also heard that the National Shanghai Medical College can lend the Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge as an epidemic hospital if necessary. However, until now, we have only heard the Health Bureau planning and preparing, but we have not seen any additional beds actually added for cholera patients anywhere. Is the reason that it is difficult to add beds? Or is it a problem of efficiency? In the past, whenever cholera was prevalent in Shanghai, social figures would come out to organize temporary epidemic hospitals on a voluntary basis. Last year, when cholera occurred in Chongqing, many social groups also devoted themselves to this matter. Now that cholera in Shanghai has become a prairie fire, if the Health Bureau's own strength is not enough, it should quickly mobilize social forces.

Third, regarding the issue of funding. On the 2nd of this month, we saw a news report saying that the disinfection staff of the Health Bureau's anti-epidemic team refused to go out because half a month's salary for June had not been paid. Hearing this news would be shocking even in normal times, let alone when "epidemic prevention is like putting out a fire"! We fully understand that all agencies are currently experiencing financial difficulties, and at the same time, we hope that people who eat public meals will be willing to work even if they have to spend their own money. However, we are willing to clarify the truth about the Health Bureau's wage arrears and work stoppage. After many inquiries, we know that the various bureaus under the municipal government have paid the salaries for June according to the newly promulgated standards, but the Health Bureau, to this day, has only paid half of June's salary, and it was paid according to the old standards. At the same time, we have also heard that some staff members of the Health Bureau are working part-time in the Executive Yuan, and their head of finance is one of those working part-time, so he is often not in the bureau. We feel that, if the above is true, then today's health authorities are not only insufficient to prevent epidemics, but also insufficient to handle any official business. Just imagine, the salaries of civil servants are so meager, and they cannot be paid on time at the end of the month, how can people survive? Furthermore, regarding the allocation of funds, if an agency cannot even pay salaries on time, then other expenses can be imagined. In this situation, it is still impossible to cope with normal situations, how can it cope with emergencies?

The three points mentioned above are the simplest and most concrete. There are also many areas related to epidemic prevention that need to be improved or strengthened, such as publicity and education, management of food and drink, and promotion of environmental hygiene. We greatly admire the spirit of responsibility and willingness to improve that the health authorities have always expressed, but the epidemic is so rampant that empty words cannot help the reality. We hope that the health authorities will work harder.

Social Services

### Answering Reporters' Legal Questions

(1) Jin Lüzhong: In the 11th year of the Republic of China, my late father mortgaged his farmland to someone surnamed X, with a contract term of five years, and the rent was used as interest. In the 31st year, my father passed away, and I immediately, together with the original intermediary, redeemed the land from X, and both were verbally agreed. Afterwards, I repeatedly urged him, hoping to clear the formalities as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, he deliberately made excuses to delay. When I wrote to urge him again, I suddenly received a reply saying: "According to Article 8 of the Regulations on the Disposal of Real Estate, redemption is allowed within ten years from the date of signing the contract. If it is more than ten years, of course, it cannot be redeemed. Moreover, this land has been more than twenty years, and the regulations have clear provisions, and it is definitely not possible to deceive people with arbitrary judgment," and so on.

Judging from this, it is no longer possible to redeem it. But since redemption was agreed several times in and after the 31st year, why is it now rejected? This is obviously too deceitful and deliberately intends to embezzle it. Now I plan to sue in court. Please give your reply to the following questions: (1) According to the Regulations on Real Estate Mortgage, how many years after the date of signing the contract is it considered abandoned? (2) During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, if a reason is stated for not being able to clear it within the prescribed time limit, can it be established? (3) Is the contract price at the time of signing the contract in silver dollars or yarn dollars, and what is the calculation standard?

(Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia): (1) Ten years; (2) If the redemption period was still within the redemption period during the Anti-Japanese War, then the right of redemption can be exercised within two years after the implementation of Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation after Recovery; (3) There is no calculation standard. The mortgagor can return the same amount of legal tender, but the mortgagee can request an increased payment in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the aforementioned regulations. If there is a dispute between the two parties, they can sue the court for a fair judgment.

(2) Shen Hanying asks: Before the war, the reader pawned means of livelihood and sundries to a certain gentleman. Later, due to the outbreak of the war, our place was the first to be hit, so most of the pawned items were lost. The pawn money had been paid at that time. Now, the gentleman wants to return the money and take back the items for his own use. Now there are two questions: (1) Is the pawner responsible for compensating for the items lost due to the war? (2) If responsible for compensation, can it be calculated according to the price of the items at the time of pawning? Please reply.

(Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia): (1) No responsibility for compensation for losses caused by force majeure of war. (2) For the claimant to recover, the liability for compensation is limited to the benefits received from the loss or damage.

(3) Chen Bokang asks: My late father passed away in November of the 26th year. He left a house that has not yet been transferred. Now I want to transfer it to my name, but the inheritance tax was not yet implemented when my father passed away. I don't know if I have to pay inheritance tax now that it is transferred?

(Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia): According to the regulations on the collection and exemption of direct taxes in the recovered areas, the inheritance tax portion of inheritance facts that occurred in the recovered areas during the period of enemy occupation (i.e., before September 2, 34th year of the Republic of China) are all exempt from inheritance tax.

### Wang Rongsheng of Shaoxing Visits, Newly Destitute

The Hateful Pickpocket Makes People Beggars on the Spot

Chen Xiguang (Tiemin) brother-in-law: Your nephew came to Shanghai last month. The address, letter, and money presented to you at the station were all picked up by thieves. I only know that you live at No. 15, Jiyi Lane, but I don't know the name of the road, and there is nowhere to ask. I am adrift in Shanghai, my pockets are empty, I have no place to stay or eat, and I have no travel expenses to return to Shaoxing. I am in extreme pain. Please inquire at the entrance of the Zhonghua Times at No. 241 Nanjing Road. If any of my brother-in-law's relatives see the report, please also inform them. I will be eternally grateful. Respectfully, Wang Rongsheng from Qianqing.

### The New Life of Guangdong

Guangdong is a fortress in South China. Whether this fortress is strong or not has a very significant impact on the entire China; therefore, the people of the whole country are expressing great concern about the situation in Guangdong Province after its recovery. Moreover, the author's concern for his hometown is more extraordinary than ordinary. Recently, I went back to Sangzi Road and lived there for more than a month. I made a more in-depth investigation of the recent administration of Guangdong Province. Now I will simply write down everything I know below for the revision of current sages.

Governance Lies Not in Much Talk

Mr. Luo Zhuoying, the chairman of the province, is a well-known man of action. In the past, his military governance was praised by the world for his constructive style. Now that he has come to Guangdong to preside over provincial affairs, he has made people recognize his character and talent even more; his view of life seems to have only one simple word "do"; and his talents are multifaceted; his foundation in old learning is very good. He has a very good understanding of the practical studies in Confucian academics. When he was a soldier, he taught his troops wherever he went. He helped the local people build roads, and even built cultural construction projects such as Confucius temples and parks. Later, in Guilin and the Youth Army in Chongqing, he used the power of the army to organize the nearby public utilities in an orderly manner. To this day, the Li Family Village in Guilin and the Daping in Chongqing still have achievements there. However, I don't want to write a biography for Mr. Luo Zhuoying here, so the reason for explaining it is to let readers know that the politics of our Guangdong can gradually embark on a new life. It is not an accidental thing.

In September last year, as soon as Chairman Luo arrived in Guangdong, he followed the instructions of the central government and passed five guidelines for administration at the provincial government meeting: (1) Select the virtuous and appoint the capable, and establish a clean and upright atmosphere. (2) Support agriculture and industry, and improve people's lives. (3) Strengthen county administration and consolidate the constitutional foundation. (4) Encourage science and promote modern culture. (5) Promote overseas Chinese affairs and enrich construction strength.

Once these guidelines were decided, they were immediately put into practice without discount, and they did not know how to be lazy. The words "singing high-sounding tunes" cannot be found in their dictionary.

Recalling the Past

Guangdong is not a simple province! Anyone familiar with the political situation will still remember it? Guangdong has always been very complicated. In addition, after seven years of enemy occupation, in order to open up and maintain the so-called mainland lifeline, the enemy cruelly destroyed all the material equipment in central and southern Guangdong. The bloody rule and exploitation of the occupied areas was far more severe than in other provinces. What's more, it was the hometown of Wang Ni and Chen Ni Bijun, who often sat in Guangzhou, and the past pseudo-provincial governors were relatives of Wang and Chen. As a result, they spread their claws and poisoned and harmed them in every possible way. Therefore, there were particularly many righteous people in Guangdong Province who fled to the interior.

After the victory, the righteous people flocked home; but their homes were broken, not only were their houses and furniture gone, but even the most basic farming tools were gone. As a result, the righteous people were transformed into refugees, traveling around and living a displaced life.

At the beginning of the recovery, Guangdong Province planned to put forward four preliminary plans: "appeasing the refugees," "restoring transportation," "clearing bandits," and "stabilizing people's livelihood." On the one hand, it made every effort to appeal to the central government for relief. After more than half a year of efforts, the broken Guangdong finally had a glimmer of hope for recovery.

Now, in Guangzhou alone, there are more than 280 civil dormitories that accommodate refugees. There are 17 civil canteens that provide meals for refugees. (Each meal costs only 50 yuan in national currency.) In addition, charitable organizations and the Young Women's Christian Association and other agencies have been mobilized to send meal tickets and bread to implement emergency relief.

Transportation in various rivers has gradually stabilized, and the righteous people have returned to various places one after another. With the help of the county government, they are all tidying up their homes or doing some small business. The social situation in various places has gradually returned to the state before the war.

Signs of New Life in Guangdong

The problem of how to build a new Guangdong is proceeding at the same time as the post-disaster work.

Strengthening cadres is a prerequisite for promoting the new administration. In the early days of recovery, the provincial government set up a training group to train local administrative cadres. Now, under Guanyin Mountain, behind the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, this place with rich historical significance has become the cradle of reforming Guangdong politics—commissioners and county magistrates throughout the province, as well as administrative staff in other departments, must be transferred here for training; there are few subjects in it, and they can be roughly divided into political training and professional training. At that time, the administrative expenses of the entire province were extremely tight, and this group naturally goes without saying, often the meals also had a precarious situation. But they are very energetic, even when they are so poor that they cannot eat enough, the people from top to bottom of the group are all energetic, and each one implements the proposition of "poor doing" and "doing in practice," full of new life and optimism in the tension. Chairman Luo also serves as the director of the group. Mr. Zhang Ming serves as the director of education. This Mr. Zhang is also particularly energetic. It is simply to the point of desperate. Because there are not enough houses, we need to add a few, but we don't have money; so Director Zhang launched a brick-picking campaign, stipulating that each person should pick up 100 bricks a day and bring them back. Director Zhang also personally started doing it himself, anyway, there are many ownerless broken bricks and tiles left over from the enemy's bombing. In less than a month of sweating work, the house was built. It saved more than 70% of the cost for the public.

I can't help but take out the two words "admire" from my heart for their spirit of doing it. With such a group of people going out to be local officials, can the local politics of Guangdong not be improved?

These are all spiritual fortresses in South China!

The Last Few Words

Recently, the provincial government decided on a five-year construction plan to revitalize Guangdong: 1. First priority is economic construction 1. To lay the foundation for industrialization and seek a large increase in people's food and clothing materials, so as to improve people's lives and enrich national defense strength. 2. In terms of agriculture, in addition to seeking increased grain production, attention should be paid to promoting agricultural products that earn foreign exchange. 3. Undertake economic construction projects such as water conservancy, transportation development, and mineral development. 2. Cultural construction: 1. For national education, the principle of one school per guarantee is adopted. 2. Secondary education, vocational and teacher training are equally important. 3. Pay attention to the education of border residents, so that the ethnic minorities of Guangdong can enjoy the same education. 3. Political construction: 1. Improve civil institutions. 2. Focus on public health. 3. Promote social welfare and cultivate social customs. 4. Support returned overseas Chinese and run production enterprises.

The above is just a summary of the plan. As for the original text, it is very long and there are many of them. I will not copy them here one by one.

This plan is obviously focused on economic construction, and it focuses on the industrial aspect. There are enough conditions for building an industrialized Guangdong. Let's see how to implement it. (Narrated by Xiaozhuang, recorded by Zhuoqing)

### Unprecedented Famine Spreads Globally! Five Hundred Million People Are Already Struggling on the Brink of Starvation

— This article is written by American Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, translated by Jun Mo from Collier's magazine.

Insufficient Food to Relieve World Hunger

The United Nations Food Conference has already taken place. We may hope that they can devise some methods to prevent future famines in the world, but at present, it would be good enough to prevent the famine from becoming more serious. Because the fact is: there is not enough food in the world to alleviate this unprecedented global famine.

Five hundred million people are struggling on the brink of starvation. If we Americans eat a little less, if we can reduce wheat consumption by forty percent, then tens of thousands of people on the verge of death may be able to be reborn. But even so, it can only slightly alleviate the pain of the famine. It is impossible to completely drive out the famine from the world.

Even if food-abundant countries do their best to help them, it will still be difficult to save all five hundred million hungry people in the world. Moreover, even if we Americans are as hungry as they are today, we will never truly understand their pain, because they have endured freezing and starvation in the long years of war. Today, they can no longer endure hunger as people who used to be full. Many, many people are dying—many, many people have already starved to death, and many, many people have died because of malnutrition and difficulty resisting diseases.

If an American eats an extra piece of bread that he could have done without, then in fact, he is hastening the death of a person in India, China, Italy, Yugoslavia, or Australia.

In the first half of this year, the hungry countries in the world need 20 million tons of wheat. But the countries with a surplus of wheat in the world can export at most 12 million tons. At the same time, the rice-eating countries in the Far East, India, China, and Japan, will lack two to three times the total amount that the world can export this year.

Only parts of the Americas and Australia can supply a considerable amount of surplus food. In the United States, the minimum goal for the first half of the year is to export 7 million tons of wheat. Whether this goal can be exceeded or even achieved—depends entirely on whether Americans can restrain themselves.

It seems to be a deliberate prank of heaven that, at this time of widespread famine, the two food-producing countries in the world, Argentina and Australia, also have poor harvests due to drought. Nevertheless, there is still hope for exports. In Canada and Australia, staple foods are still rationed; in Argentina, fuel is always insufficient, and we are prepared to supply them with coal and oil so that they no longer have to burn food and vegetable oil as fuel.

Dying Slowly, Two Days Between Meals

By July 1 this year, the United States had approximately 125,000,000 bushels of wheat. So far, the weather has been exceptionally good, and this winter's wheat harvest may reach 830,000,000 bushels. Let's compare our situation with the 100 million starving people in Europe: 74% of Austrians, 43% of Finns, 75% of Germans, 59% of Italians, and 50% of Hungarians eat only a few small pieces of bread a day—this is simply slow starvation.

In the United States, children have lunch at school, but in many European countries, children are too hungry to study, teachers are too hungry to teach, and parents are too hungry to guide them in their homework. In the United States, children have milk at school, but in Greece, they can only mash bread in olive oil as milk. When the first batch of UN food arrived in a small Yugoslav village, the village chief slowly said:

"Our children eat only every other day."

The famine in Europe is mainly due to two reasons. The first is drought, the most severe drought in modern history, which withered the crops on both sides of the Mediterranean, North Africa, Spain, France, and the Balkans. Moreover, European land relies on fertilizers, and the war interrupted the work of fertilization. In fact, the war itself was a fatal cause: farmland became battlefields, coupled with the lack of agricultural machinery and insufficient manpower and animal power, making the European harvest extremely poor, and the destruction of inland transportation further increased the severity of the famine.

Disease and Death: The Price of War

If Europe were the only famine-stricken land, then the world's food crisis would already be serious enough, but unfortunately, other parts of the world are also in the midst of disaster.

Ninety percent of the world's rice is produced in the countries on the "hem of Asia"—Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam. China, Japan, Malaya, and India have always been roughly self-sufficient. But the situation this year is very bleak. Burma, formerly the world's largest rice granary, can only export 100,000 tons this year.

In China, more than ten million people are suffering from hunger. Many have already starved to death. More people will starve to death before the autumn harvest, because in this war-torn country, transportation has been greatly damaged in the war, and food distribution cannot keep up with the race of hunger. Hubei, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Guizhou are all lands of hunger, but none of this is more serious than Henan. There, in order to contain the last foolish attempt of the Japanese in 1945, the Yellow River embankment was opened, turning two million acres of land into a marsh, which supplied food for three million Chinese people.

But we must understand that this large-scale world famine is the result of a large-scale world war. It is war that destroyed farmland and disrupted transportation. After every large-scale conflict, the world sees that the price of war is famine, disease, and death. Let us hope that mankind can remember this lesson before the next war breaks out.

### The "Glass" Age

British and American scientists have repeatedly said: "Almost nothing cannot be made of glass plastic." Indeed, look: glass belts, glass raincoats, glass handbags, glass leather shoes, glass combs, glass... If atomic bombs hadn't been created at this time, everyone would probably be shouting, "The Glass Age has arrived!"

In reality, the "Glass Age" has indeed arrived. American and British industrialists are working hard to manufacture glass plastics to meet the large-scale needs after the war.

In fact, the glass products we see... are just luxury goods. What China really needs is not these kinds of luxury goods, but rather radios, telephones, and electrical appliances made of glass plastics.

Large factories in England are mass-producing glass plastic radios, telephones, electrical appliances, auto parts, and building materials. Many complex parts are molded into a single piece using glass plastics, making manufacturing simple and durable. When manufacturing plastic utensils, they are mostly pressed with a press, with each square inch of plastic subject to a pressure of several tons to dozens of tons. One press uses a pressure of 75 tons per square inch to manufacture glass combs, producing hundreds of them per hour. Another factory produces thousands of plastic telephones and radios each week. One type of plastic is simply indistinguishable from ordinary glass, and another type of plastic can be used as optical glass. In England alone, there are 40,000 workers engaged in this industry. The speed of development of the plastics industry is truly astonishing. At present, it has become the most fashionable industry. We are preparing to welcome the arrival of the "Glass Age"!

### Another New Invention

Tooth decay is a very common problem, but it can have a very serious impact on human health. Famous dentist Dr. Gottlieb has invented several inexpensive chemical drugs. After brushing your teeth with these drugs, you can guarantee that you will not suffer from tooth decay within an hour, with an effectiveness of 90 to 100 percent.

This doctor is sixty-one years old, originally from Austria, and fled to the United States when the German army occupied the country.

### Accurate Statistics

Soviet Army Removes German Machinery

How much industrial equipment did the Soviets actually remove from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany? This is a question of great concern to the military administration and even journalists. Last week, "Newsweek" obtained a relatively accurate estimate from the files provided by the Military Government's Industrial and Military Administration Department, the figures are as follows:

50% of metal factory equipment was removed; 80% of alkali manufacturing plants were removed; 70% of nitric acid plants were removed; 50% of caustic soda factories were removed; 75% of other chemical plants were removed; 100% of celluloid factories were removed; 60% of paper mills were removed; 80% of sugar refineries were removed.

It is said that the Soviet side also removed 2,000 kilometers of railway track (equivalent to 1,240 miles), and in fact, the number may be even higher.

### Atomic Bomb Test Results: Neither Too Good Nor Too Bad; The Bomber's Mistake Will Be Regretted Forever

— Translated and Narrated by Zuo Xi

In this joint US Army, Navy, and Air Force atomic bomb test held at Bikini Atoll, there are many different opinions from people of various countries regarding the test results, and there is no consensus. The following is a translation of the personal impressions mentioned by six special reporters from the United Press who witnessed the bombing from the air and sea from various angles, for consideration.

The first reporter, Bartholomew, was soaring over Bikini Island when the atomic bomb fell. He said: "Looking down from the air, the situation was far different from what was predicted at first, which inevitably makes people disappointed. But the next day, looking down at the panoramic view of the bombed target from a low-flying plane, I found that the affected area was very large, and the extent of the damage was very severe. The reason why people feel disappointed is just like an excellent movie, which is hyped too much beforehand, and when you see it, you feel it is bland."

The second reporter, Terry, participated in the atomic bomb test aboard the United Press special ship Appella Jiang, saying: "The atomic bomb is terrifying, even when viewed from twenty miles away. No military weapon in the world can produce such a huge flash, and it can sink five ships and damage more than forty other ships with one blow."

The third reporter, Myer, observed the bombing from the flagship of Lieutenant General Blandy, saying: "I dare say that the destructive power and fierce scene of this bomb fully meet all the reports, although it pales in comparison to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. My impression is that this test was not very successful in terms of scientific research, for two reasons: the bomb did not hit the Nevada, but sank the Gillen, a military ship carrying important instruments."

The fourth reporter, Pennyhoff, said: "Bomber Major Wood failed to drop the bomb within 500 feet of the target ship, resulting in the fourth atomic bomb in history failing to achieve its full extent of damage and provide the expected scientific data. In fact, it exploded in mid-air, which is not very clever in the strategy of attacking naval ships."

The fifth reporter, Moller, observed from the observation ship Panamint, saying: "Calmly speaking, the firepower of that bomb was much smaller than initially expected, but after inspecting the lagoon on the ground, my emphasis on that bomb increased accordingly. Based on my observations in Japan, this bomb has the same destructive power as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Because the buildings there are fragile and the population is dense, the superficial losses seem to be greater. But this bomb does not seem as fierce and terrifying as the one in Nagasaki."

The sixth reporter, who observed from the Appella Jiang special ship, said: "My impression of this test is one of disappointment, because there was nothing surprising except for the usual mushroom-shaped smoke column. However, I believe that although the bomb is not as terrifying as ideal, it is ultimately a fierce weapon against the fleet."

### Hymns

— Liang Youting

Religion and art have been connected.

Indeed, religion has made use of art, as Mr. Feng Zikai said, in the Middle Ages, music was the slave of religion. But many arts also rely on religion to spread. A chapel combines the arts of architecture, sculpture, fine arts, and poetry (hymns) as a tool for preaching. They use that magnificent architecture, majestic arrangement, and solemn singing to create a psychological reaction when you walk into the chapel, making you feel the sublime and greatness of the environment, and the moving sound of the singing, making you feel smaller and smaller. This is the intention of the missionaries. If you look at the independence of art, of course, art has been captured and used as an accessory; but after each major war, art can still be preserved, and this cannot be attributed to religion. Just as after music and words are combined, the music itself becomes an accessory to the beautiful words, but without the combination of literature, the melodious melody and gorgeous harmony feel without attachment. The emergence of "Program Music" is also due to this.

Therefore, there is no need to be hostile to religious music. I think that the upright melody and calm rhythm can indeed nourish our souls. People in the city are constantly competing for fame and fortune all day long, and their nerves are constantly tense, and they really need to have opportunities to clear their minds often. Even if you are not willing to mechanically go to church, if you can take the time to listen to or sing a hymn in your daily life, in the clear morning when you get up, or in the night before going to sleep, it will definitely give your mind a vision of goodness and beauty. We do not have to believe in the soul and heaven, but if you assume that the magnificent singing comes from the distant "heaven," and that heaven symbolizes a sacred realm, then the mind entangled with troubles and pain will suddenly calm down and have a far-reaching sustenance. I often feel that the form of religion is very beautiful, and the content is very good. Although we do not necessarily believe in it, we can often appreciate its beauty and yearn for its goodness. This is actually one of the ways to enjoy life.

Don't think that religious music belongs to religion. In fact, the melodies of hymns were not originally written for hymns; many hymn scores were originally the crystallization of the hard work of famous musicians or famous folk songs, and religious people took these artistic essences to use as religious tools. For example, the famous hymn Holy Night, its score was originally a German folk song, and the ancient Chinese songs "Man Jiang Hong" and "Yangguan Sandie" have also been included in hymn collections. Therefore, religious music is originally very good music, and it should not be discriminated against just because it is given a religious color.

However, some people complain that hymns are too "monotonous" and feel boring; I remember that at the music festival the year before last, we held a concert in the rear, and there was a short chorus of religious songs, and the listeners impatiently said: "Let's go to church!" This is just like the reason why many people can only accept Jazz. Of course, I do not deny that listening to too many hymns can also be tiring, but treating it as a part of your musical hobby program—that is, a part of your daily life—must be very beneficial.

I appreciate hymns.

### In Memoriam

— Yao Naiyu

Xueyan, my child! I never imagined that after enduring eight years of suffering, you would end your life so hastily. Eight years ago today, your mother and I, carrying you unborn, reluctantly left Shanghai. And eight years later, we finally returned home for a family reunion, only for you to quietly leave this world!

I recall last year, when we returned to Shanghai and then back to our hometown, how fortunate and joyous we felt! After enduring these long years, we finally saw the hometown we had dreamed of for eight years. Your grandmother greeted us at the door, suppressing the tears that welled up when she saw her two granddaughters, you and your sister Bingzhi. Then, you shyly called out "Grandma," making her so happy that she picked you up and stroked you with her withered hands, forgetting the hardships, pain, and all the wounds she had suffered under the enemy's iron heels for eight years. Child, I secretly rejoiced for you and blessed your grandmother.

You lived in the countryside for over four months, mainly because I couldn't find a house in Shanghai. But the rural life was beneficial to your frail body. When school started, you entered the local elementary school. You began to recognize those unfamiliar children and the faces of the villagers. Your inherent intelligence and gentle nature won the love and praise of everyone. Child! The hometown retained the simple old customs of the eighteenth century. People were diligent and frugal, not inclined to meddle in others' affairs, especially those of a girl from another family, which they considered unworthy of discussion. But, child, you were like a handful of fine sand thrown onto the calm surface of the hometown lake, stirring up a beautiful ripple. You stirred their ancient nerves, causing them to spend some time each day talking about you. You created a miracle in the hometown.

The hometown was close to Shanghai. Every Sunday, when I had time, I would ride my bicycle back to see you. You would always be like when I returned home from work, holding Bingzhi's hand, jumping and shouting, "Daddy's here!" to welcome me. When I left home, you would wave your hand and shout, "Goodbye, Daddy." You seemed very happy and satisfied with life in the hometown. But your mother told me that you often secretly asked her, "Has Daddy found a house yet?" or "Why hasn't Daddy found a house yet?" Child, I understood your feelings. Although you were welcomed and praised by the hometown, your heart often flew to my side. So I tried my best to ask people everywhere to help me find a house, and finally found one at the beginning of last month. On the twelfth, I took you from the countryside to Shanghai. For the sake of your schoolwork, I had tried to let you finish this semester in the hometown before leaving, but you were unwilling under any circumstances. I couldn't bear to go against your wishes, because you had never left me before! Who knew that you would fall ill only ten days after arriving in Shanghai. The Western doctor said your illness was chronic meningitis—an incurable disease! The Chinese doctor said it was damp-heat disease and prescribed medicine for you, but it was also ineffective. You finally left me. I regret that my months of rushing around ruined your little life!

When you were dying, I returned you to the hometown for the last time, forever. Many people who loved you came to see you. Many people who loved you shed tears and called out your name. But your bright eyes would no longer twinkle, no longer recognize those faces that had once been unfamiliar but had become intimate. Your thin lips would no longer softly call out "Daddy." At 12:50 PM on June 8th, you took your last breath!

Child! You are gone. You lay quietly on the wooden board. Aunt Fang put on makeup for you and dressed you in your favorite red qipao. She combed your long, black hair and braided it into two smooth little braids, tied with red silk ribbons, just like the first time you returned to the hometown. You were still so beautiful, so exquisite. Child ah! Who says you are dead? I wonder if my nerves are failing. I rushed up to kiss you, but the people around dragged me away. Someone was burning your clothes, and the flames blazed, illuminating the room. I stared at the terrifying fire. It burned your beautiful clothes, and it burned my heart, but it couldn't ignite the beating of your heart.

I sat on the threshold of the east wing, staring blankly at your black and lovely little braids, which contained the stories of the past eight years, displayed before my eyes scene by scene. You grew up in a mountain city by the sea. That vast sea and the soft beach were what you often longed for. We had spent three years and ten months there living on borrowed money. Later, we crossed four provinces and nine major cities. We were once on a Yangtze River ferry, where everyone was scrambling to cross. For your safety, I broke my rule and argued with people, almost resorting to violence. Because there was no food, you once ate peanut cakes to satisfy your hunger, which only made you hungry for two days. In different locations in a big city, you and I were simultaneously attacked from the air, but luckily we were unharmed. You once secretly shed tears because I was whipped by the enemy, not letting me know. You sometimes had palpitations and insomnia because of excessive fright. You... child, all these unbearable memories, you have made me relive—and will forever relive again and again in grief!

Child, school is dismissed for the evening. Your little friends are carrying their schoolbags and passing in front of our house. Their cries startled them, and they stopped curiously, holding their schoolbags and looking inside. Child, I opened your schoolbag for you: in addition to two textbooks issued by the school, there was a pencil box and a doll that I had recently bought for you. On the first page of your notebook, you copied "Sun Yat-sen's hometown is..." On your arithmetic book were the last arithmetic problems I had given you. I seemed to see your hand waving, writing in the book. But your hand will never wave again after all. You were put into that wooden box that takes away the laughter of the world. I gently placed your schoolbag beside you. I cried out to you bitterly, child, but you no longer say "Goodbye, Daddy"!

Child, you are gone! Your death may be indifferent to this world, but to me, it is an irreparable wound. You took away your wisdom, your gentleness, and you also took away the miracle you created in the hometown. Eight years of cuddling together ended with the end of your life. But I will always remember all of this, always remember all of this, always remember you!

### Mother and Child

— Xie Zi

"If she is a wall, we will build silver battlements on her, and if she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar..." This passage is particularly familiar to me. It must have been about two years ago. One day, after we had finished our evening chores, Mother suddenly opened the Song of Songs in the Old Testament and asked me to read to her the marked passages and try to explain them. But I had never read this chapter before. I never thought there would be such words in the Bible!

"I really don't understand, Mother," I said embarrassedly, "and I don't need to understand either!"

"No, you need to understand. Otherwise, you won't understand how much I love you." She smiled gently—what a gentle solemnity! "My dear child," she stroked my hair and let me lie on her lap. "I went to your room to see you the night before last. You didn't know, did you?"

"The night before last? Was it the night of the heavy rain, Mother?"

"Yes. I was thinking of you because it was raining and cold. Why didn't you even close the window or turn off the light? Were you asleep when you didn't want to fall asleep?" She paused and then said, "Did you have any dreams that night, my Mei?"

I looked up at Mother, who was also smiling at me.

"No," I said, "I can't remember."

"But I still remember for you! Wasn't that a very annoying dream? Alas! When I went to cover you with a blanket, you were simply a weepy child. Your eyes were full of tears, and even your pillow was half wet. At the time, I really wanted to wake you up and ask you what was going on. Or at least I could free you from the annoying dream. But after thinking about it, I didn't do that. I know there won't be any other reason for this. You have always been raised in a clear family, haven't you?" As she said this, her voice was simply as gentle as a whisper. "When you were in swaddling clothes, I guessed that you were an emotional daughter. But, my child, this kind of character, added to a mother's love, will certainly turn into pity. Added to a mother's responsibility, it becomes a heavy burden."

I lay in silence, like a two or three-year-old child. I felt that since that day, Mother had been particularly kind to me. It was really more than just kindness. How should I say it? I have seen many people's families, where it seems like there is no sunlight. But me, am I dreaming? Can I enjoy such close love in this world?

Mother just came again. "You're not asleep yet?" She said in a soft surprise.

"I was thinking about you, Mother." At this moment of perfect understanding, I was almost moved to tears. "Brother just came back. He said he wanted to come and see you. I told him you were already asleep. I didn't expect you to be pondering here! But you should go to sleep, Mother," I said gently, "Look, the moonlight is already filling the window!"

### Two Mothers

— Zhongyuan

Recently, I saw a letter written by a deeply religious mother in her forties to her only son. The son was already twenty years old, strong and healthy, and studying at a certain university. One day, he suddenly sent a quick letter home, saying that he had been admitted to a certain army and would soon go abroad for training. The mother calmly read her son's letter several times and immediately wrote a reply to her son. She wrote:

"If you are going to save people and love people, even if you drift to the ends of the earth and never come back, I will never be reluctant to let you go. But if you are going to train to kill people, train to shed blood, I don't think this is God's will, and I will do everything in my power to stop you!"

Seeing this mother, one can't help but think of another mother, the very famous Spartan woman in the storybooks: In the past, when Sparta was at war with another country, a woman first sent her eldest son to the battlefield. Soon, he died in battle, and when the bad news came, she was not sad at all. She immediately sent her second son to the battlefield. Soon, he also died in battle, and she was still not sad. She sent her third son to the battlefield, but soon the third son also died in battle. This time, when the bad news came, the woman wailed loudly. People asked her why she was so sad this time. She replied, "I only had three sons in total. Now they are all dead, and I no longer have a son who can fight and sacrifice for the country!"

Two mothers, one who loves peace and opposes bloodshed, and one who is bravely patriotic and not afraid of sacrifice. We cannot deny that they are both great. However, the concept of right and wrong varies according to time and place. In today's world, of course, the Spartan mother is greater. Otherwise, you love peace and are afraid of killing and bloodshed, and you stop your son from joining the army; but others do not love peace and are not afraid of killing and bloodshed, and encourage their son to fight you, then wouldn't you just sit and wait for death?

But even if that is the case, we might as well have an ideal.

I often close my eyes and imagine: If one day, every mother in the world, like this mother who loves peace and opposes bloodshed, does everything in her power to stop her son from joining the army, then what a happy and lovely world will be created!

Serialized Novel

### Double Flying Swallows (18)

— Zhao Qingge

Lihua's status has not only risen in the theater, but also at home. Regarding the profits she earns, she does not ask or interfere, and everything is handled by Mrs. Mo. But regarding her personal actions, Mrs. Mo cannot excessively inquire. For example, she likes to read; she does not want to go out for social events; Mrs. Mo must not interfere with these things. This minimum right is what she has earned in exchange for the profits she brings to Mrs. Mo, and it is a little progress in her life in recent years. She is no longer like before, completely at the mercy of Mrs. Mo, a puppet to be manipulated. Now, she has finally redeemed a part of "herself" from Mrs. Mo's palm, and Mrs. Mo has to accommodate her to some extent. She has become silent, serious, and dignified! Whether in the theater or at home, she hardly pays attention to those colleagues who are seven parts ghost and three parts human; she also rarely pays attention to Zhang Xian and Mrs. Mo; even Liyun. On stage, she is doing it for "duty," crying, laughing, speaking, and singing; off stage, she is a mute who does not speak. Others can do nothing about her, and dare not do anything about her. This is another little progress in her spirit, she is able to make people respect her!

Only Zhang Xian, this kid, still does not change his old ways, often trying to tease Lihua with a playful smile. Because he relies on the fact that he is Lihua's teacher, and Lihua cannot scold him. And he relies on the fact that Lihua needs him to play the huqin, and Lihua cannot leave him. Therefore, others are afraid of Lihua, but he is not afraid! Others respect Lihua, but he does not respect her! This makes Lihua very painful. She has negotiated with Mrs. Mo several times to dismiss Zhang Xian, but Mrs. Mo refuses. Mrs. Mo knows that half of Lihua's success depends on this huqin. But if Lihua gets angry and threatens Mrs. Mo that she will not sing anymore, Mrs. Mo will also gently persuade Zhang Xian with kind words. Zhang Xian knows Lihua's temper and does not dare to provoke her too much, but he will never easily give up on this beautiful flower that has yet to bloom!

In this way, Lihua spent her fourteenth year in a seemingly peaceful, yet not peaceful, living environment. Suddenly, there was an unusual commotion in Beijing, followed by war and chaos, and people were panicked! A few days later, the flames of war blazed, and the sound of artillery rumbled!

In President Song's press conference, there were several places where the news was unclear, and I will now make a supplement.

President Song said: I have presided over the Bank of China for nine years, and I have never appointed a single private individual. If you don't believe it, you can investigate. I believe that those who can be law-abiding, diligent in their duties, are my people. Taking the directors of the three enemy and puppet property disposal bureaus established after the victory as an example, Liu Gongyun used to be a colleague of the Bank of China. At that time, he opposed me, but I still use him now because he is honest, brave, willing to work, and responsible. Sun Yueqi and Lin Jiyong, I definitely did not know them beforehand. Someone said they were good, so I used them. I didn't meet them until they took over the job.

President Song said: Public and teaching personnel are indeed too hard. Among them, the best are selling clothes to maintain their lives, and the second best are complaining. Those who complain are also good people. There is also a third group, and that is corruption.

President Song said: When Japan surrendered, there were a total of 3.5 million spindles. The original yarn factories had fallen into a difficult situation to operate. Knowing that the yarn price would definitely rise after receiving them, why did the government sell these spindles and let a few people gain huge profits? The government has no such obligation. Rather than letting a few people make windfall profits, it is better to make it contribute to the country's finances.

The press conference adopted a numbered seating arrangement, with cigarettes, snacks, and coffee on the seats. One question followed another, and the questioners were very enthusiastic and passionate. As soon as the questioner sat down, President Song immediately stood up to answer, quickly, directly, and very sincerely. The scene was indeed moving. If President Song didn't have other business, if it was extended, it might not have ended until dark.

### Where is the Rice?

— Shijing

I remember Mayor Wu said at the Tsinghua Alumni Association: Every time I participate in an alumni association, the rice crisis will be suppressed once. This time, the rice crisis has been going on for more than a week, and I have not seen the wise mayor come up with a way to suppress it. I think this must be because the Tsinghua Alumni Association has not yet held a meeting! Otherwise, the rice crisis would have been suppressed long ago.

It is a fact that the city government distributes rice to rice shops (reported on July 5 that the city government distributed more than 7,000 bags of rice to rice shops). It is also a fact that all the large and small rice shops in Shanghai have their doors open, but there is not a single grain of rice in the shops for more than a week. It is also a fact that the common people take the banknotes issued by the National Bank, but they cannot buy rice in the rice shops. Even if there are occasional rice vendors on the streets and alleys carrying a few dou of rice, they are sold out in a rush due to scarcity and competition, and the price is more than double the usual price, which is beyond the reach of poor scholars like us. Moreover, this situation does not happen every day, forming an abnormal phenomenon where money cannot buy rice. The common people are panicking that there will be a day when they have no rice to eat, because we are ultimately Chinese and should eat Chinese rice, and we cannot change our daily lifestyle to eat Western food. This problem is really too serious. We citizens cannot help but shout loudly: "May I ask the mayor, where has the rice gone"!

### Seventy Years of Telegraphs

— Xi Ju

The installation of telegraph equipment in our country has not even reached seventy years yet. The laying of telegraph lines began with the Shanghai-Songjiang line, and the company responsible for its operation was the Great Northern Telegraph Company, a Danish trading house. In the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, Shen Baozhen, submitted a memorial detailing the benefits of telegraphs, but it was not implemented due to certain circumstances. In practice, China's own self-established telegraph line dates back to the second year of the Guangxu reign. In that year, Li Hongzhang laid a telegraph line from Tianjin to the Dagu Beicang Fort, marking the beginning of China's self-managed telegraph service.

The telegraph entered China during the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, primarily managed by the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company. At that time, maritime transport between China and foreign countries had been established, and novel foreign objects were continuously introduced to China. While foreign guns and cannons were previously unknown, foreign dragons (fire engines), kerosene, and gas were also considered novelties. As for telegraphic communication, it was even regarded as an unbelievable act of ghosts and spirits. After the successful opening of the Great Northern Telegraph line, an announcement was first published in the Shenbao newspaper of the second year of the Guangxu reign, seventy years ago. The text read: "In recent years, the ingenuity of Western methods is unparalleled by telegraphs. Over tens of thousands of miles across the ocean, ordinary letters take months to arrive, but now they can be delivered instantly. Even if it is thousands of miles away, a response can be received in an instant. Therefore, all countries have established telegraph services. In the imperial court, they transmit confidential and important matters. In commerce, they transmit market prices of goods. It is indeed a most ingenious and essential method..." At that time, various Western studies had not yet spread to China, so the telegraph service was regarded by the public as a "clairaudient."

The Great Northern Telegraph Company belonged to the Danish Jing Shi Telegraph Company. Around the time of the signing of the Five Ports Treaty, it established telegraph lines in several trading ports in China and Japan. In its published advertisements, it specified that "Wusong Seaport, Snake Island, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, New Gold Mountain (now Melbourne), Nagasaki, Yokohama, Kobe, Hakodate, and even India, Europe, and America are all reachable. To facilitate communication for the Chinese, the company also hired specialists to compile a telegraph codebook, as evidenced by this advertisement. The text reads: "Our company has now created a Chinese character telegraph book, convenient for Chinese people to understand its use. The method involves using numbers to represent Chinese characters. This book is available at our company and various branches. Those who wish to send telegrams to our offices will receive a free copy of the book, along with a detailed explanation of its wonders. There is also a price list for sending telegrams to various distances, so that one can know the cost at a glance."

By the sixth year of the Guangxu reign, Li Hongzhang again petitioned for the allocation of 178,700 taels of silver to establish the Northern and Southern Seas Telegraph, laying the Shanghai-Tianjin line and establishing seven telegraph offices in Tianjin, Dagu, Jining, Qingjiang, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Shanghai. On the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month of that year, the entire line began operation. In the eighth year of the Guangxu reign, another line was extended westward along the Yangtze River from Zhenjiang to Nanjing, passing through Wuhu and reaching Hankou. It took two years to complete the project. In January of the tenth year, it was further extended to connect with Hong Kong. In October of the same year, the Shanghai-Guangzhou line was also constructed by the Qing government. To the north, the line was extended from Tianjin to Beijing, and from there to Shanhaiguan and Baoding, with two branch lines from Jinan reaching Zhifu and Qingdao. These were all matters of the tenth year of the Guangxu reign. By the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign, the line from Beijing across Mongolia to Kyakhta was completed, and our country's land line to Europe was thus completed.

After the national government established its capital in Nanjing, national unification was achieved in the summer of the following year. A national transportation conference was convened, and given the facilities and contracts of the Great Northern, Yangtze River, and Pacific submarine cable companies over the years, which were deemed extremely unfair, after various negotiations (the contracts expired on December 31st of the nineteenth year), the receiving and sending offices of the three companies were taken over. Thus, the Chinese Telegraph Bureau was unified. In total, the Chinese telecommunications industry, from its inception to the present, is less than seventy years old. Now, not only can the entire country communicate by telegraph, but wireless radio stations and broadcasting stations have also sprung up everywhere, its development cannot be considered slow. However, today, the United Kingdom and the United States have already entered the business phase of wireless radio image transmission and wireless radio films from the experimental stage. It is hoped that the Chinese people will catch up quickly to avoid being left far behind everywhere..."

### The Beginning of Prostitute Inspection in Shanghai

— Xi Ju

Reports state that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has already ordered the registration of prostitutes in Shanghai. Meanwhile, another source claims that the number of American soldiers stationed in Shanghai suffering from venereal diseases has increased sharply, and has sent a letter requesting our government's assistance in solving this problem. Recalling two or three months ago, He Chuqin also mentioned the serious problem of sexually transmitted diseases in the military in his report, urging all parties to pay attention. It is understood that the Shanghai health authorities, in order to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, will intensify the inspection of prostitutes in the city on the negative side, and are planning to add sexually transmitted disease hospitals on the positive side, in order to eradicate venereal disease bacteria.

The system of public prostitution in Shanghai began, and the history is no longer verifiable, but the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to inspect prostitutes dates back to the fifth day of the sixth month of the second year of the Guangxu reign, in the year of Bingzi. According to the Shenbao newspaper of the thirteenth day of the sixth month of that year: "On the fifth day of the month, the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting, not only merchants were present, but also Consul Macgregor, the naval commander, and the naval doctor of the Municipal Council were also present. The matter discussed was that prostitutes may be infected with venereal diseases, which are bound to be transmitted to others. It is necessary to open a hall and have doctors examine each person. Those who are free of disease will be allowed to work as prostitutes. Those who are infected will have their licenses revoked and be ordered to be treated in the medical hall. They will be allowed to receive customers again after recovery. This measure already exists in Hong Kong, and the procedures are roughly similar. From my humble opinion, the matter is for the sake of the 'salty water girls' (note: prostitutes who specialize in receiving foreign sailors). It is feared that sailors who are intimate with them may contract sores or venereal diseases, and be unable to exert their efforts in their duties." It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Council did not order the "Shu Yu," "Chang San," "Yao Er," and "Hua Yan Jian" prostitutes to be inspected one by one at that time. The reason was obviously that the patrons of the above-mentioned prostitutes were all Chinese, and had nothing to do with foreigners, and a laissez-faire policy was adopted. The last paragraph of the article also stated: "If these 'Shu Yu,' 'Chang San,' 'Yao Er,' and 'Hua Yan Jian' are also to be inspected one by one, it would inevitably be a chaotic and shameful scene. It is now planned to conduct a trial run first, and then decide how much the expenses will be before making a final decision."

On the fifteenth day of the same month, the Shenbao newspaper published a commentary on the inspection of prostitutes, saying: "Western doctors inspecting prostitutes seems quite indecent to the Chinese, but Westerners consider it a commendable act. More than ten years ago, various Western countries believed that human desires are inherent in nature, but if they are indulged without restraint, disasters will inevitably befall the body. This is a self-inflicted sin, and heaven uses it as a warning, which the state need not interfere with. Later, after the state carefully investigated, it was found that prostitutes have more contacts and are more likely to be infected. Once sailors, soldiers, and other personnel are intimate with them, they will transmit the infection. The minor cases will develop sores and toxins, and the major cases will damage life and lead to infertility. The ignorant and foolish are pitiable. Therefore, special regulations are made to establish bureaus and assign doctors to examine them. Prostitutes who are found to be infected will be given careful treatment. Once they are cured, they will be sent back. If there are those who do not want to be prostitutes again, the bureau will help them find suitable matches and marry them off. Many prostitutes have thus been removed from the register and escaped from the fiery pit. Now, various ports in the West are following suit, and all are well-managed. This measure not only protects many prostitutes, but also benefits the military and civilians alike. The Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to implement it is a practical move, silently embodying the beauty of creation. It is hoped that those who hear and see it will not treat it as a strange thing."

Currently, our country does not have a clear policy on the issue of prostitution at the central level. Some cities have adopted a laissez-faire policy, while others have banned prostitution. Regardless of which is considered the better policy, the inspection of prostitutes is not only reasonable, but also necessary. After the war, all countries in the world are suffering from rampant venereal diseases. Although our country does not have accurate statistics, its spread is widespread and has already reached remote rural areas. If it is not eradicated urgently, the health of the nation will be threatened in the future. Therefore, the inspection of prostitutes is not only a matter of urgency, but should also be followed nationwide, so as to avoid the danger of extinction and national decline.

### Cicada

— Wu Daquan

Cicada, cicada,

Flying east, cicada,

Flying west, cicada,

Just how much do you know,

Yet hanging on the treetop, chattering,

All just nagging,

I see you have no plan at all,

Vainly swaggering,

Considering yourself a hero,

But all in vain,

Don't wait for the west wind to get angry,

Sending you to see the King of Hell,

Too late to regret.

### Travel to the Moon

— Dongfang Jing

Long before "radar" made contact with the moon, more than a thousand people in the United States had planned to travel to the moon. These visionary people belong to the "American Rocket Society" - a non-profit organization; founded in Illinois in 1942. Members include engineers, astronomers, chemists, and other scientists, both professional and amateur. It is the largest "rocket craze" group in the world.

According to past estimates by the vice president of the society, a rocket ship traveling to the moon would cost about US$25 million. Now, with the application of atomic energy, the cost has been reduced to US$300,000. Atomic energy will also reduce the supply of fuel to accommodate more crew and other instruments.

This group believes that in the post-war world, lunar travel will surely be realized. Let's wait and see the realization of this miracle!

### Humorous Sketches

— Jiang Ping

After the court sentenced Little Peter and Big Peter to twenty years of imprisonment each; Little Peter straightened his chest and said confidently: "Big Peter is already fifty years old this year, but I am only twenty years old. I believe Big Peter has at most two or three years of life left, so he will at most serve two or three years of his sentence. But I am still a young man, so my life will certainly not be shorter than Big Peter's. So, if you calculate it this way, Big Peter will only have two or three years of imprisonment, while I will have twenty years of imprisonment."

### Flattery

— Yang Mou

When you are sitting there getting your shoes shined, and the shoe shiner compliments how good the style of your shoes are or how sophisticated they are, even if your shoes are already broken or old, he seems to reopen the brilliant history of the past for you, and you often can't help but smile.

As a human being, one always likes people's flattery to a greater or lesser extent. The degree inevitably depends on personality, and likes and dislikes also vary with personality.

I remember such a fact that one person refused all praise and flattery, but when someone complimented him as the person in the world who loved flattery the least, he would also nod and smile.

Everyone has their own position and attitude towards life, and they all vary from person to person and from place to place. But, in a word, who can jump out of its circle?

However, whether flattering others or being flattered by others, one should always have appropriate consideration between the acceptable and the flattering, otherwise, one will definitely be ridiculed.

### Sent to My Deceased Wife Fengjun (2)

— Zhou Shoujuan

I didn't spend this Lunar New Year well. On the one hand, I was busy checking things and preparing for the move to Suzhou; on the other hand, I was secretly worried about your illness. Occasionally when I went out and met relatives and friends, I always used this as a topic of conversation, hoping to gain their sympathy and comfort, and their views were exactly the same as those of Dr. Cheng. Therefore, my heart was a little relieved. I fully believed that when I returned to Suzhou, you would be able to slowly get rid of the clutches of the disease. However, our hometown has a quiet environment, lush flowers and trees, and plenty of air and sunshine. It is a natural sanatorium. If you go back to recuperate for one or two months, actively treat with injections and medicine, even if the disease is fierce, you must know that it is difficult to retreat; you are also very optimistic, just waiting to spend the Lantern Festival, you can see the gentle mountains and soft water of Suzhou again.

After all the furniture was loaded onto the ship, we set off on the 18th morning. Zheng'er and his young couple and Bao Mei and her son were all scheduled to accompany us to Suzhou; my old friend Major General Liu Hanjun knew about it and first sent someone to the train to reserve a few first-class seats, and then sent a captain to pick us up in a jeep. Such kindness really made me very grateful! The weather was not cold that day, but there was some wind. Even though you were wearing a thick camel hair coat, I was still afraid you couldn't stand it. I wrapped a scarf around your mouth, nose, and neck, and wrapped a large handkerchief around your head. Along the way, I asked you if you were cold or uncomfortable? You always smiled and said you weren't cold, you were very comfortable, putting my mind at ease. When getting on the train, the daughter-in-law helped you walk a long way, you walked very fast, and you didn't pant; sitting opposite me in the car, you were always talking and laughing, very happy. When we got off the train at Suzhou Station, the daughter-in-law still helped you walk a long way before we left the station. Then we took a rickety rickshaw for twenty minutes to reach home. Your thin face still had a smile on it, saying that you didn't feel tired; I knew that you were so happy and forgetful because you were seeing your hometown after eight years of separation.

The next day, I was busy visiting a few medical friends and showing them the X-ray photos. They all said that the situation was not serious and that calcium and vitamin BC should be injected. So, the retired Dr. Pang introduced a young Dr. Wu next door to me, who came to inject it every other day. The calcium and vitamin C were injected into the muscle. At that time, your fever rose and fell every day. When it was high, it was two degrees higher than normal, and when it was low, it was one degree higher than normal. There was never a time when it was completely gone. At first, I didn't hide it from you, which made you very anxious, but I couldn't comfort you. After more than half a month, my old friend Cheng Xiaoqing and his brother returned to Suzhou. Hearing that your fever had not subsided, he suggested that you should get air injections. His wife and his cousin Yude, who had suffered from lung disease and was still recuperating, also thought that air injections were necessary. It was useless to inject only calcium and other three kinds of medicines. Now that things have come to this point, there is no room for delay. I was very grateful for my old friend's enthusiasm, so I asked him to book a first-class ward for you in Boxi Hospital. The next day, the person in charge of the hospital sent a stretcher to carry you away. I stayed at home to keep guard, and Grandma Ye, who had been working in my house for more than twenty years, took care of the housework, so that Bao Mei could accompany you in the hospital to avoid loneliness. Two days later, Dr. Huang gave you an air injection on your right lung. I watched trembling beside you. Your face turned very ugly. It seemed that your chest was very stuffy. After the doctor left, you still said: "It's extremely stuffy, extremely stuffy, how can I not breathe?" I panicked and went to ask the doctor. He said that this was a phenomenon that should occur after the injection, and it would be nothing in a while. After more than ten minutes, it gradually recovered. At that time, I was very optimistic, because I had heard Yude say that if the air injection could be given, then as long as it was given, the lungs could be killed, and the bacteria would have no way to move; I comforted you with these words, and we both had joy. While you were staying in the hospital, I always came to visit you every morning. A long blue and white patterned vase was placed on the side of your sickbed. When there were any flowers in the garden, I would pick them for you to enjoy, from green plums to white magnolias, each flower seemed to be smiling at you. In a blink of an eye, half a month had passed. Air injections were given every three days, and the left and right lungs had been injected twice each, and calcium and other three kinds of medicines were still injected every other day, plus bihekoling was also injected four times, and medicine from the hospital was taken, always three or four times a day. But I don't know why, your fever still rose and fell, and there was not much progress. I had to ask the nurses to lie to you and tell you that the fever had completely subsided. Feng, you must understand my suffering, my deceiving you is all to make you feel at ease!
