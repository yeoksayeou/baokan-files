### Unfinished Mediation Work in Shandong Province: Jinan Group Flew Back to Beiping Yesterday; Communist Army Requests Discussion in Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] The Jinan Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters has completed its mediation work in Shandong. This afternoon, they flew back to Beiping to seek instructions on their work direction from the Executive Headquarters. They will return to Jinan within the week to continue mediation work.

[Another Dispatch] The Jinan Group of the Executive Headquarters flew to Linyi, the location of the Shandong Provincial Government of the Communist Party, twice on January 31st and February 2nd, to meet with Chen Shiqu, Chief of Staff, and Chen Yi, Commander of the Communist Party (New Fourth Army). During the meetings, Chen Shiqu stated to Colonel Lake: Upon receiving the cease-fire order, they will certainly adhere to it. However, the Japanese and puppet troops who have not yet surrendered still have intentions to attack the Communist army. If they retreat sixty li according to Order No. 2 concerning Peace, it would be tantamount to relieving the siege of the Japanese and puppet troops, rewarding traitors, and rewarding aggressors. He hoped that the Executive Headquarters would reconsider this point. Regarding the implementation of the cease-fire order and the restoration of transportation, Chen Shiqu also stated that after the cease-fire order was issued, the entire Shandong Province entered a state of cease-fire. The only conflicts that remained were those against the Japanese and puppet troops. Since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, there was no need for puppet troops to exist. Therefore, having the puppet troops lay down their arms today is a prerequisite for all current issues. The Communist army is capable of disarming the Japanese and puppet troops and has the right to do so. Therefore, the issue of the surrender of Japanese and puppet troops was the focus of the Linyi meeting. During the meeting, Colonel Lake elaborated on his position, stating that he did not represent either the Kuomintang or the Communist Party. The sole purpose of this trip was to find a way to stop the conflict and end the state of war. Lake cited the examples of France and Norway in dealing with enemy troops after all issues had been resolved. He hoped that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would not dwell on the past, meet with sincerity, and that all issues would be easily resolved. The first meeting did not reach a conclusion. After staying overnight in Linyi on February 6th, the Communist side presented six demands as a result of the meeting, still based on the proposals from the first meeting. The group felt that they could not be resolved, so Chen Shiqu, representing the Communist army, came to Beiping to seek instructions from the Beiping Executive Headquarters. In short, the Communist army in Shandong believes that it controls nine-tenths of the 107 counties in the province, while the government only holds Jinan and Qingdao, which are like isolated islands. Therefore, they firmly advocate that the Japanese troops in Shandong should surrender to them to replenish their weapons. As for the restoration of transportation, the Communist Party believes that the Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways in Shandong are under their control and that they must have the right to guard and manage them before they can be restored.

[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] According to the government, the New Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Party has put forward various demands, making it impossible to implement the cease-fire agreement in Shandong, including (1) the abolition of the Jinan and Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, (2) the reorganization of the National Army in Shandong, and (3) the surrender of the local Japanese troops to the Communist army, and the management of railways in the Communist-controlled area by the Communist side. Brigadier General Bird, the American representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, is here now and is scheduled to meet with Zhou Enlai today, mainly to discuss these demands.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th] The Xinxiang Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters held a symposium on the 7th to exchange views. The Communist Party representative requested that Xiuwu and Huojia counties should be assigned to the Communist army, while the government representative proposed that Meng County should be stationed by the National Army, which became the focus of the dispute. According to reports, Xiuwu and Huojia counties were recovered by the National Army before the cease-fire order, while Meng County was occupied by the Communist army after the cease-fire order.

[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 8th] The Shijiazhuang Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters held a three-person meeting on the 6th, both in the morning and afternoon. In addition to reiterating the No. 2 order of the Executive Headquarters and requiring both parties to strictly comply with it, they also studied the implementation methods of the work. At 7:00 a.m. on the 7th, government representative Hu Pinghan, American representative Greble, Communist Party representative Xu Decao, and others took a special train to the conflict site in Yuanshi to conduct an actual investigation.

### Restoring Rail Traffic in North China: Authorities Are Actively Preparing; Mediation Executive Headquarters Sends Planes to Inspect Various Lines

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 8th] It is reported that the transportation authorities have a preliminary draft and are fully prepared for all preparations for the current restoration of railways in North China, waiting for the notification from the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters.

It is also learned that after the materials ordered in the United States are shipped to China, the Jingwu Railway will be relaid. The Jinghu Railway has recently added four passenger trains during the Spring Festival to facilitate passengers returning home. Currently, the Jinghu Railway has more vehicles operating than before the war.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] News from transportation circles: Although the issue of restoring railway traffic is still in a stalemate, the third batch of road repair personnel has been ordered to depart. Once an agreement is reached on the road recovery issue, the restoration project of the northern section of Jinpu and the Qianjin along the Jiaoji line will be started first. Today, informed sources said: If Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai can quickly fly from Chongqing to Shandong, this worrying situation can be opened up in three days.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chongqing News: Colonel Lake, the American representative of the Jinan Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department, will cancel his resignation due to Marshal Marshall's possible visit to southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu with Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai to inspect.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] The Military Mediation Executive Headquarters dispatched several reconnaissance planes today to fly to various important locations to inspect traffic conditions, and all returned to Beiping on the same day. [United Press, Tianjin, 8th] Today's Chinese newspapers reported: Night trains will be running between Tianjin and Beiping in the near future.

### Starving People Trapped in Various Parts of Shandong Number More Than 500,000; The Tragedy Is Beyond Imagination

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] According to Shandong provincial government officials who came to Beijing from Tai'an, the number of starving people trapped in Tai'an, Yizhou, Lincheng, Zaozhuang, Yixian, and Jimo is more than 500,000. The number of refugees fleeing to Jinan and Xuzhou from various counties in southwestern Shandong is 600,000. Currently, at least 100 people die of starvation every day in Tai'an and Zaozhuang. The trapped people in various places not only need food and clothing relief but also spiritual comfort, because after being disappointed, some people are so angry that they automatically throw their children to death. The tragedy is beyond the imagination of those who live comfortably in cities, drink and chat, and talk about democracy. The Army Department has now requested the Relief Administration to allocate a large amount of flour for relief.

Slightly Capable of Escaping and Seeking Refuge

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Since the cease-fire order was issued, the Communist army in Shandong Province has continued to carry out its brutal acts in its stationed areas. The counties near Jinan and Qingdao, unable to withstand the trampling and destruction of the Communist army, have all fled to Jinan and Qingdao for refuge. Taking Rizhao County as an example, 20,000 people have fled to Qingdao. According to Zhang Ji, the number of such refugees registered in Qingdao has reached 200,000. According to He Siyuan, there are more than 100,000 such refugees in Jinan. The so-called local Eighth Route Army in various counties is unimaginably brutal, and it is feared that it cannot be controlled by the Communist army. Fair-minded people in various places hope that after the consultative conference, the Communist army should join forces with the National Army to suppress bandits. This call is indeed a noteworthy issue. According to someone who came from Qingdao on January 27, the Communist army's conscription in the Communist-controlled areas is becoming more and more severe, changing the age range to 13 to 45 years old, and even 70-year-old women have to stand guard. Sun Sheng's family property, clothing, and utensils have been completely taken away, and he is still being held in custody. His mother, who is over 90 years old, has also recently been paraded through the streets and forced to sit in a stand-up bamboo basket, which is also one of the Communist army's cruel tortures. The basket is filled with thorny weeds, forcing her to sit in it, with a jolt every three steps, the thorns piercing into her thighs, causing unbearable pain. After the parade, she is ordered to go on stage to confess her crimes. Yang Hanchen wears a white paper hat and is paraded through the streets with his hands tied behind his back. More than a thousand families, including Sun Lechang and Qu Hesheng, have recently been completely taken away. Houses of those who have been struggled against are hung with lanterns, and deaths after being dragged away are common. Recently, a virgin in Shuicheng Village was dragged away, and her breasts were ground off. The walls of Penglai City have recently been completely demolished, and the city has been divided into twenty villages. Recently, each village was ordered to produce a Yangko team, with women stilt-walking and men playing gongs and drums.

Penglai Ancient Pavilion Leveled to the Ground

Penglai Pavilion, a famous scenic spot since the Song Dynasty, has recently been leveled. Cui Weiwu, secretary of Envoy Zhang Xuan, who went to Qingdao, said that the people in his hometown of Yucheng are living a miserable life, and the situation is roughly the same as in Penglai. His aunt, who is over 70 years old, was also tied to a stack of tables by the Communist army and placed on a high platform, forced to announce the crimes of her sons and grandsons who worked outside. The food at home was taken away, leaving them with nothing to live on.

Homeless and Grieving

The reporter is from Rizhao, and his family has more than ten mu of thin land and several heads of livestock, which were confiscated long ago. The forest mountains have also been taken away. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan and the recovery of the territory, his personal thin land was also taken away, leaving him homeless. Thinking of this, he sighed deeply. The various brutal acts of the Communist Party in his hometown, as described in a letter from Si Xiang from Qingdao, are roughly the same as in other places. Their methods of struggle, such as ordering landlords to compensate tenants for many years of rent and forcing owners to address servants as elders, are also the same as in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces. If the government and the Communist Party can faithfully implement the secondary proposal of the consultative conference, the reorganization of the Communist army will be successful, and how the social order in its stationed areas will be restored and how the brutal acts of the so-called local Eighth Route Army will be corrected are issues that urgently need to be resolved. Otherwise, the local people in several provinces in North China will have no survivors.

[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] Negotiations on the reorganization of the government continue today. The Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Kuomintang is scheduled to be held here on March 1, and the reorganization is expected to be realized after the meeting concludes.

Then, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun attended and reported on the recent agricultural and forestry facilities and the reception of agricultural and forestry enterprises in the recovered areas. Zhou first reviewed the main work of the department last year, which was to increase the production of grain and cotton. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective, but affairs such as reclamation, fishing, and forest protection have not been able to be promoted due to various reasons. He then reported on the situation of agricultural rehabilitation, the handling of post-disaster relief materials, and the reception of enemy and puppet agricultural and forestry enterprises, explaining them separately. Finally, Zhou Min described his work and feelings during his six months as the head of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and put forward discussions on issues such as the use of foreign technology and materials, the use of received enemy and puppet agricultural and forestry enterprises, the cultivation of technical talents, and the strengthening of local agricultural institutions. After the report, senators Qian Gonglai, Wang Puhan, Li Zhongxiang, and Kong Geng raised many inquiries, which Zhou answered separately. Then, the proposals were discussed. Those present at today's meeting were members of the presidium Mo Dehui, Jiang Yong, Wang Yunwu, senators Yin Shuxian, Fan Yushui, Wang Puhan, Qian Gonglai, Wu Zhaoxu, Luo Heng, Xu Deheng, Kong Geng, Li Zhongxiang, He Baoren, Chen Bosheng, Xu Xiaoyan, Hu Jianzhong, Chen Qitian, Department Secretary-General Lizi, and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen, totaling nineteen people.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] At the 15th meeting of the Senate on the 8th, two proposals and one inquiry were passed as follows: (1) Senator Wang (Puhan and three others) proposed that the national cotton price has fallen sharply, which has greatly affected the livelihood of farmers, and the purchase and transportation of foreign cotton may deepen this crisis. It is requested that the government give priority to purchasing and using domestic cotton stocks, promote cotton loans, and encourage cotton production to protect the interests of farmers and save the bankruptcy of rural areas. It was decided to send it to the government for practical handling. (2) Senator Yin Shuxian and three others proposed that the government increase the salaries of public servants and teachers promptly and practically based on the price index. It was decided to send it to the government for prompt handling. (3) Senator Qian Gonglai and three others proposed that they had recently read in the newspaper that Zhang Xinmin and eight others, members of the Fushun Coal Mine Reception Committee of the Northeast Camp, were killed on their way back to Shenyang.

### Situation in the Northeast Remains Chaotic; Rumored to Be Related to New Sino-Soviet Economic Negotiations

[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] The repeated delays in the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast are rumored to be related to new Sino-Soviet economic negotiations regarding the disposition of mining and industry in the Nine Eastern Provinces. Observers with informed sources here have gradually come to believe this rumor. After the Political Consultative Conference resolved various internal issues of China, at least in theory, the attention of the Chinese press has shifted back to the Nine Eastern Provinces. It is said that all heavy industry in the area is still in Soviet hands.

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Qualified sources here told a United Press reporter that the Northeast today is facing the darkest moment in its history. This powder keg of the Far East is already smoldering, brewing a future war in Asia. Informed sources revealed that, to date, there is no sign that the Northeast issue has been submitted to any United Nations agency, and it remains in a "ominous state." They pointed out that there are many reasons why the situation in the Northeast has become difficult, most of which are international in nature. They are listed as follows: (1) The Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference stipulated that Soviet troops should withdraw from the Northeast by February 3rd, but this has been delayed again. To date, neither Chongqing nor Moscow officials have provided any explanation for this extension. (2) The mysterious difficulties encountered by the Chinese government forces in taking over the garrison work in Jinzhou and Changchun. (3) There are Communist forces in the southern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces and a "Communist League" in the northern part, posing as resistance to the government forces. (4) The emergence of the newly independent "East Mongolian Autonomous Republic," with its capital located in Wangyemiao, 220 miles northwest of Changchun. (5) The mysterious Sino-Soviet negotiations on the joint management of Northeast mining areas, heavy industry, and transportation. Neither Chongqing nor Moscow officials have provided any information on this matter. (6) The Red Army has renewed contracts with local grain and coal merchants until the end of May. (7) The Communist Party is taking this opportunity to demand that the Central Government allow it to participate in the handover of Northeast sovereignty from the Red Army. (8) The increasingly imminent threat of civil war, as the Northeast is not included in the ceasefire agreement signed between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on January 20th. (9) There are still two million Japanese military and civilians in the Northeast waiting to be repatriated. (10) There is an unknown number of former Japanese mercenaries in the Northeast, who are now being used by various political groups. Some are affiliated with the Communist Party, some are affiliated with the "Communist League," and most are affiliated with the Mongolian cavalry of the new "East Mongolian Autonomous Republic."

[United Press, New York, 7th] The "New York Herald Tribune" discussed the issue of the continued presence of Soviet troops in the Northeast today, stating that the United States' participation in the discussions between Chongqing and Moscow on this matter is based on the United States' "traditional desire to maintain China's territorial integrity." The newspaper believes that it is extremely important that the disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue should be resolved in a friendly spirit. "But the independence and well-being of the Chinese and Korean people should be considered first." The "New York Times" commented on the Korean issue, stating that the occupation situation in Korea is far from satisfactory. [Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] February 23rd is Soviet Red Army Day. The Soviet troops here are preparing a grand celebration at that time.

### Constant Conflicts between National Army and Separatist Factions: An Outline of the Xinjiang Situation; Special Article from Our Newspaper; Sent by Zhu Minwei After Returning from Xinjiang

Xinjiang Province—this fertile and still undeveloped virgin land in the cold desert—has a population of four million, among whom, besides the Han people, there are other ethnic groups such as the Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and Mongols. For decades, there have been no significant conflicts or struggles among these disparate groups. However, in the past year or two, the Kazakhs, because they have not shed the habit of robbery, and coupled with new factors, have repeatedly stirred up warfare in the desert, causing concern among people at home and abroad. Fortunately, after our National Government dispatched General Zhang Zhizhong to Xinjiang for negotiations, the situation of warfare came to an end. Now the Kazakhs are once again using the excuse that the negotiation agreement has not been approved by our government to provoke the National Army, which is noteworthy. The author of this article recently went to Xinjiang on official business for the Political Department of the Aviation Commission and has just returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Based on what he has seen and heard, he has written two special articles, which will be published in our newspaper in succession, to share with our readers. (Editor)

Starting from November 7th of the year before last (1944), the prelude to the war in the Xinjiang desert was opened by the battle for the defense of Yining city. Defending the Yining city area were the Seventh Reserve Division, the Air Force Training Corps, and the local troops of the Yining area. Attacking were the Kazakh cavalry.

Kazakh Cavalry Stir Up Desert War

How did this war start? No one can say for sure the immediate cause. If one must find some reason, it can be said to be the manifestation of the conflict between settled economic forces and nomadic economic forces. Those who have been to the Northwest know that there is a clan in the desert called the Kazakhs. This is a nomadic clan similar to the Mongols. The population is not large, and their base is in the Altai Mountains bordering Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang.

The Kazakhs are accustomed to nomadic life, with no fixed residence. Like the Mongols living in "Mongolian yurts," the Kazakhs live in "Kazakh yurts." The form and structure of the "yurt" are extremely simple. Mud and grass are their main materials. In Xinjiang, when mentioning the Kazakhs in the Altay region, everyone knows that this term is linked to the meaning of robbery and plunder. This Kazakh clan, based in the Altay region, has been drifting in a nomadic state throughout history. The rugged terrain of the Altay region has protected them like an impregnable fortress. The Junggar Basin south of the Altay region and the entire northern Xinjiang north of the Tianshan Mountains are naturally their nomadic grasslands and plunder areas. Especially in the past twenty years, the Kazakhs in the Altay region have been unable to invade to the north and west (the Northwest is all Soviet territory). They have no choice but to forever direct their fierce gaze at the settled clans in the south. The urban areas of the northern Xinjiang region, centered on Dihua, are mainly Han and Uyghur agricultural and commercial areas. Therefore, the Kazakhs regard the Han and Uyghur people as thorns in their sides. In addition, the military and political power of Xinjiang Province has been in the hands of the Han people for decades. The first goal of the Kazakhs in battle is naturally to "kill all the Han people." In October 1944, it was precisely the period of transition in the Xinjiang provincial regime. Governor Sheng Shicai, who had ruled Xinjiang for fifteen years, had just been transferred to Chongqing in August. Wu Zhongxin, who was known for his deep understanding of Mongolian and Tibetan border affairs, came to lead the provincial administration. The Kazakhs felt that this was an opportunity, coupled with other factors. The Kazakh cavalry charged into the Yining city area, a vital town in the western frontier of northern Xinjiang, on November 7, 1944.

Sabers Enter Yining; Garrison Soldiers Determined and Firm

Yining is a border city where various ethnic groups live together, with a population of over 80,000. The Uyghurs and naturalized groups (Russians who entered Xinjiang during the old Russian era and were naturalized after the Soviet revolution) are the most numerous. The customs and habits are similar to those of the new urban areas of Harbin, with a strong Russian urban flavor. In this place, as early as the beginning of our country's war of resistance, the Soviet Union assisted our air force in training, so there was a large air force barracks and several airports. In this battle for the defense of Yining, the air force barracks and airfield located in Alinbagh (place name) became the most intense battle centers in Yining. The battle lasted for eighty-seven days. This first battle of the Xinjiang War was truly fierce. Both sides were determined to win. If the defending soldiers failed, there was no reason to live, only to be beheaded by the Kazakh sabers. The Kazakhs were determined to capture this rich city. Whether they could control part of Xinjiang in their hands was a key. The Kazakhs increased from 10,000 to 20,000. The entire Yining city area gradually fell into their hands, but the training corps barracks and airfield remained in the hands of the defending soldiers.

National Army from Lanzhou Advances Westward on a Long Snowy Journey

Of course, our government did not want this important place to fall. But if we do not forget the situation a year and a half ago, we naturally remember that November 1944 was precisely when Guilin and Liuzhou fell, and the Japanese army advanced rapidly toward Guiyang. The entire landscape of China was as dark as the winter season. Commander Zhu Shaoliang led a force from Lanzhou, traveling west day and night, but the snowy journey from Xingxingxia to Yining was too long. The air transport planes were busy transporting Tang Enbo's troops from Xi'an to Guiyang to build an emergency defense line to prevent the Japanese army from advancing north to Chongqing. Air Force Commander Luo Ji desperately requested several air transport planes to personally send weapons, ammunition, salt, and medicine, and also send Guokui (flatbread) to Yining. This kind of rescue undoubtedly supported the hearts of the defending troops, but when all their strength was exhausted, those defending soldiers could only regret losing this jewel on the national border when they died. The troops of Li Tiejun, who rushed to Dihua from Xingxingxia, only had time to build a defense line in front of Jinghe County to defend against the Kazakh cavalry occupying Yining from advancing eastward.

However, it was also quite difficult to supply the Jinghe front line from Dihua via Suilai Wusu, a long road equivalent to that from Chengdu to Wanxian. This supply line was not only exposed to the wind and snow of the severe winter in the Northwest but was also entirely exposed to the threat of the Kazakh cavalry in the Altay region. Therefore, throughout the winter, until May 1945, small groups of Kazakh cavalry harassed the line from Jinghe to Dihua from time to time. Due to the difficulty of supply and the lack of equipment to resist the freezing of thirty degrees below zero, the army officers and soldiers from Lanzhou not only had difficulty launching attacks but also stiffened in the trenches or had their hands and feet frozen off. After the arrival of spring, the war seemed a little more lively due to the vitality of the sun, but due to the disparity in strength, the Kazakh cavalry still defeated our infantry everywhere.

From spring to the present, the military situation in northern Xinjiang for the past six months has still been unfavorable. At the end of July, the situation in Tacheng, another border town in northern Xinjiang, was unclear. Emin, near Tacheng, was lost. Commander Wan, who was bitterly defending Chenghua City at the southern foot of the Altay Mountains, was certainly holding on to the death. However, ground transportation has been cut off, and there is only one line for transporting ammunition and other military supplies by air, while southern Xinjiang has always been a prosperous and peaceful industrial park. On August 14th, Baicheng in southern Xinjiang was lost to the Kazakhs who crossed the Tianshan Mountains. (It was then recaptured by the garrison on August 19th.) In September, Wusu, a vital place on the Dihua-Jinghe line, was occupied by the Kazakhs coming down from the Altay region. The defensive front had to be rearranged, with Suilai as the first line, forming a defensive posture to defend Dihua to the death. This is the outline of the war that has taken place in the Xinjiang desert in the past year.

Wu Zhongxin's Style as a Classical-Style Head of Household

The sixty-two-year-old Wu Zhongxin has always been a figure in the government who frequently comes into contact with border affairs. When the central government changed the new provincial government, this old man was sent here. After arriving in Xinjiang Province, he did many things quietly. This is a more classical-style head of household. He observed and listened, handling the affairs of the new province based on his forty years of political principles and experience. First, he released the thousands of political prisoners held in the Dihua prison in the provincial capital. These prisoners included Uyghurs and Han people. Many of the Uyghur prisoners were leaders in the Uyghur community. This matter improved the poor relationship between the government and the various ethnic groups under its rule. It is known that Wu Chairman knew that Xinjiang had made the mistake of Han chauvinism in the past, so he tried his best to appoint talented people from various ethnic groups to many government positions. For example, each department of the provincial government set up a deputy director. The deputy director of the Construction Department was a Mongolian, and the administrative commissioner of the Dihua region was a Tatar student who had studied in Germany. Many county magistrates were Uyghurs. The Uyghurs, Tachs, and Kazakhs jointly formed a Comfort Commission in Dihua. This commission regularly carries out comfort work for remote ethnic groups. After Wu Chairman arrived in the province, many ethnic representatives came to Dihua from all over the province to see him. He felt that at least all ethnic groups knew that the new provincial government in Dihua was approachable, which meant that the first step towards a new beginning with the people had been taken.

Senators from Various Ethnic Groups Gather in Dihua for Negotiations

In August and September of this year, the temporary Senate of Xinjiang Province was convened. I saw cars after cars of Uyghur senators from southern Xinjiang and senators from other ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province gathering in Dihua. War is a chasm that divides the government and the Kazakh cavalry on both sides, but in the promotion of the entire provincial administration, Chairman Wu took into account giving political power to various ethnic groups, giving them freedom, and giving them the opportunity to participate in being masters of Xinjiang Province. In August, even one of the four leaders of the Kazakhs in the Altay region voluntarily came to negotiate. The government plane flew to the Chenghua airfield and landed, taking him to Dihua. Chairman Wu, this old man, believes that reason can be communicated with any ethnic group. Therefore, in the turmoil in Xinjiang, he did not publicize any great principles but simply and practically sorted things out peacefully, like untangling a tangled thread.

Promoting War and Construction Simultaneously

Although Xinjiang is at war, construction work is being carried out closely to meet political needs. Without a doubt, the economic phenomena on the surface of Xinjiang consist of the coexistence of nomadic and agricultural societies. The construction effort of the Xinjiang provincial government is to gradually improve the economic structure and form to achieve the purpose of Xinjiang's progress. For example, from labor on the ground to development underground, from nomadism to agriculture, from agriculture and small handicrafts to industrial production. Planned government construction is indeed more powerful in Xinjiang Province than the natural development of the social economy.

At present, the construction work in Xinjiang that directly benefits the people is water conservancy, followed by transportation. If there is a railway from Lanzhou, connecting the transportation within Xinjiang Province, the movement of people and the circulation of goods can be smoothly resolved. At present, apart from irregular aviation and automobiles connecting the inland and Xinjiang, Xinjiang is in fact isolated from the inland. The situation is no different from the relationship between Tibet, Outer Mongolia, and the inland. Therefore, I hope that the western extension of the Longhai Railway will end west of Lanzhou and be closer to Xinjiang than being far away from Xinjiang. Of course, due to resource constraints and geographical proximity, Xinjiang needs to obtain the assistance of the Soviet Union in transportation construction and the development of important mineral resources, which requires breaking the diplomatic deadlock.

### Solving the City's Traffic Problem

— A Commoner

Improving Traffic Regulations; Enforcing Traffic Control

On the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance—from 1944 to 1945—in major cities in the rear such as Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and Guiyang, due to the concentration of military vehicles and the surge in transportation volume, traffic order was chaotic, leading to unfortunate accidents that caused injuries and deaths. At that time, there were many American military vehicles in various places, so the transportation authorities felt that Americans were not accustomed to driving on the left. They planned to switch to driving on the right to correct all weaknesses. After the victory, Shanghai's traffic also encountered the same problem. Therefore, on January 1st of this year, the authorities resolutely decided to switch all traffic nationwide to driving on the right.

Now, this system has been in place for over a month. During this month, how much effect has it actually had? How much has order improved? How many deaths and injuries have been reduced? The municipal authorities must have investigated and compiled statistics on the number of incidents that have occurred. The January 31st newspaper reported that General Wedemeyer "intends to visit Mayor Qian Shiwei to discuss remedies because Shanghai's traffic situation is quite chaotic," which shows that the current traffic order in Shanghai has still not been sufficiently improved, causing concern for our allies. Therefore, we ourselves must quickly solve our own problems and take effective measures as soon as possible. Stabilize ourselves and facilitate others.

The way to solve traffic chaos and reduce accidents causing injuries and deaths, to put it boldly, cannot be solved by simply driving on the right or left. The basic principles lie in having regulations for driving and having control over driving. When Americans drive in their own country, they are familiar with American traffic regulations and abide by their traffic controls. However, when they arrive in major Chinese cities, some places have no regulations, and some places have traffic regulations but no control methods. As such, because we ourselves fundamentally lack order, foreigners are at a loss in this environment, and they will therefore disregard and boldly rush around, causing many unfortunate incidents, making it impossible for us to sanction them. However, we should also state that Americans often cause accidents while driving after drinking alcohol, for which they alone must bear responsibility. Therefore, Shanghai needs to explore these two aspects to improve traffic in order to solve the entire problem. The self-examination should start with asking: Do we ourselves have comprehensive traffic regulations? Do we ourselves enforce traffic according to these regulations? Then ask: Do we need to improve our various traffic control equipment and methods? Generally speaking, these issues need to be studied from multiple perspectives. First, our traffic volume must be suitable for the width of our streets. Second, our streets must have classified properties in order to channel our traffic congestion. Third, our traffic lights must be functional in order to meet actual needs, so as to avoid chaos and danger. Fourth, when our vehicles have no passengers, the place and time of their stop must not affect or obstruct the movement of traffic. Fifth, pedestrians on the road must use the functions of the sidewalk and must not walk randomly in the middle of the street in order to avoid the risk of injury or death. Sixth, how do we enforce control over these actions that do not comply with regulations, so that we can gradually guide them into normal behavior? Seventh, how can we make cars, pedicabs, rickshaws, and bicycles travel in separate lanes, so that they do not interfere with each other and avoid the chance of collision? Eighth, how do we revise our traffic regulations, how do we improve our control equipment, and at the same time, how can we make millions of people in the city understand these regulations and know their obligation to comply? These issues cannot be fully explained in a few words; we must discuss and plan each aspect in detail.

I believe that before the entire plan is decided, there are five urgent matters that need to be implemented immediately:

(1) The streets of the entire city should be re-designated with a traffic-oriented street system based on the number of vehicles and the direction of travel on each street. For example, important streets should be designated as thoroughfares, and connecting non-important streets can be designated as one-way streets or stop streets. Definite parking spaces should be marked on various streets, and all kinds of vehicles should not be allowed to stop on the street at will.

(2) The traffic lights at important street intersections should be changed to fixed-time signals. It must be able to display the prohibition or permission of turning left, turning right, and reversing at that location, so as to save the traffic police who control the traffic lights and instead use them for patrol and control work, and to increase the function of the traffic lights. Unimportant intersections can be equipped with flashing signals to guide traffic and pedestrians.

(3) The police force should add a traffic police system and train traffic police officers, teaching them modern traffic management knowledge. If necessary, a traffic court can be established in the police station to execute punishments for those who disrupt traffic order, and to analyze the causes of traffic accidents to prove who is responsible for the accident.

(4) Pedestrians must be able to fully utilize the sidewalk and must not walk in the middle of the street, and they must not cross the road at will in any place. Pedestrians who want to cross the road must cross it in the designated place to avoid danger. In this regard, not only is the guidance of traffic police needed, but also efforts must be made to make the public feel the need for this action.

(5) Set up more slogans and promote more publicity, so that the general Chinese and foreign public can have a deep understanding of traffic order and traffic regulations, so as to have an automatic behavior of complying with everything, and then reduce unfortunate incidents.

Shanghai is the largest city in the country, and maintaining traffic order is a very important and necessary administration. In general, the quality of a city's municipal administration can be seen from its traffic order. Traffic regulations and traffic control are specialized disciplines. Shanghai must solve the current traffic problem, and there is no doubt that it must start from these two aspects, and it cannot be shifted by simply implementing driving on the right or left. Alas! No city in China has good traffic order. Walking through each city, the traffic situation is completely chaotic! Therefore, I hope that Shanghai can lay the foundation for traffic management in our country, serve as a model for traffic management in cities across the country, and thereby resolve the current misunderstandings between allied personnel and our Chinese people caused by traffic accidents, and reasonably analyze who is ultimately responsible for such accidents.

Editorial

### Dark Clouds in a Bright Atmosphere

According to a special dispatch from Beiping in our newspaper yesterday, the situation in the Northeast has become increasingly complex in the past week. According to reliable sources, an organization called the "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" was established on January 15th in Wangye Temple, the capital of the former puppet Manchukuo Xing'an South Province, and announced the independence of the "East Mongolia Republic" in its National Congress. The chairman of the government, Wu'erzhan, is a Buryat Mongolian general affiliated with the Soviet Union. This news only reached here yesterday due to transportation delays. It is understood that the so-called East Mongolia refers to the Zhuolei Tu and Zhelimu leagues, and its area includes most of the three northeastern provinces of Xing'an, Liaobei, and Rehe. The newly established "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" has determined its national flag to be a red flag with a yellow miner's knife and whip inlaid on it, indicating that it is an agricultural and pastoral country. Agence France-Presse also had similar reports yesterday. On the same day, a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, citing private sources, said that the National Army and Xinjiang separatists had clashed again. The conflict was caused by the central government's failure to approve the agreement signed by Chiang Kai-shek's special envoy Zhang Zhizhong and three representatives of the separatists. The separatists are mostly Turks, and the entire territory is called the "East Turkestan Republic," with its capital in Yining. These two news items, one from the Northeast and one from the Northwest, are truly regrettable when the whole country is immersed in a peaceful atmosphere caused by the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference. Although this news still needs to be verified and further developed, it is generally a well-founded report. All this news inevitably shows a few more dark clouds in the gradually clearing political sky.

Since the surrender of the enemy, the situation in the Northeast has been clear and dark at times in the past five months, almost like periodic malaria. This situation has continued to this day and has not been greatly improved. According to a Chongqing dispatch in our newspaper on the 7th, the Soviet army was originally scheduled to withdraw from the Northeast at the beginning of this month, but it has been delayed again. Now, the main personnel who are to take over are coming to Chongqing one after another to ask for instructions, and their actions are confidential and tight-lipped. On the other hand, news also says that the takeover of factories and mines in the Northeast has been suspended, and experts have to stay in North China to work. The personnel we sent to the Northeast to take over are mostly tight-lipped about the situation in the Northeast, and the experts can see the Northeast but cannot reach it. General public opinion has not commented much on the situation in the Northeast. Some people, especially us reporters, only allow themselves to see the bright side of the dark side of the situation in the Northeast and try to exaggerate it, hoping to be self-indulgent in the exaggeration. All this is truly unspeakably difficult. However, today, when the situation in the Northeast has been deadlocked for more than five months, and new situations have been unfolding one after another in the past five months, if we still cannot reveal a little in our tolerance and silence, we are truly ashamed to be reporters again, and we are really too sorry for the people of the country.

Why do we need to tolerate and remain silent about the situation in the Northeast? This is because we deeply cherish the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Because we believe that the Soviet Union will fulfill its commitments and respect the treaty of friendship between China and the Soviet Union, we always look on the bright side under the basic right of "freedom of speech" and would rather tolerate and remain silent. However, the development of the situation in the Northeast over the past five months cannot but make us deeply anxious. The National Army taking over the defense of the Northeast cannot use the seaports of the Northeast and must advance along the railway line from Qinhuangdao, and it has not yet entered the city of Shenyang that the Chinese people will never forget! From the Liaodong Peninsula across the great plains of the Northeast to the border between China and the Soviet Union, it is said that there are still so-called "people's armies" in each of these places! After this series of unpleasant news, the news of the sudden emergence of a so-called "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" has recently come!

The leader of the "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" is said to be a Buryat Mongolian affiliated with the Soviet Union, who graduated from the Soviet Red Army University and received the title of General in the Red Army. The Buryat Mongolians live around Lake Baikal. Although they are Mongolians like the Inner Mongolians in the Northeast, they are not indigenous to the local area, and they are also generals in the Red Army. The truth of this so-called "autonomous" movement is highly questionable. Moreover, the agreement on the Northeast region was concluded by the Chinese National Government and the Soviet Government. Before the power of the National Government reached the Northeast, the Soviet authorities had the treaty obligation to transfer the entire Northeast to the National Government for takeover. Therefore, within its defense zone, any situation that arises and develops that conflicts with the interests of the Chinese National Government is difficult for the Soviet Union to ignore. Therefore, even if this so-called "East Mongolia Autonomous" movement is a spontaneous movement of the local people, we believe that the Soviet army, which is responsible for maintaining order, will also stop it. Otherwise, won't this situation of dividing China's borderlands gradually obscure the light?

The same divisive movement has also appeared in the Northwest, which is far away from the "Mengjiang" of the Northeast. In the western border of Xinjiang, the so-called "East Turkestan Republic" has also appeared. The "Turkestan Republic" in Central Asia was originally a part of the Soviet Union. What is the relationship between the "East Turkestan Republic" that has appeared in Xinjiang today and the "Turkestan Republic"? We don't know, and we don't want to speculate. The Soviet Union also has the "Kazakh Republic" and the "Tajik Republic" in Central Asia, and there are Kazakhs and "Tajiks" in our Xinjiang. If this principle of division can be recognized, then we will no longer have Xinjiang! Outer Mongolia established the "People's Republic" and recently left us. The "Tannu Uriankhai People's Republic" also left us long ago and joined the territory of the Soviet Union. Today, there is the "East Mongolia Republic" in the Northeast and the "East Turkestan Republic" in the Northwest. What will happen to them in the future? Only future history can prove it. Coincidentally, we see the Azerbaijan autonomous movement in Iran and the Kurdish autonomous movement in Iraq from afar, which are similar in different ways and are a sight to behold. In order to maintain the integrity of our territory and the integrity of our sovereignty, we did not hesitate to wage a long-term war of resistance against Japan. Now that victory is in sight, the situation before us is a map showing the beginning of piecemeal encroachment, which truly makes us ashamed to be a "great power"!

China and the Soviet Union are adjacent to each other, from the west coast of the Pacific Ocean through the Ussuri River, the Heilongjiang River, across the desert and the Altai Mountains, to the Pamir Plateau. The length of the border between them is unmatched in the world. The Soviet Union is eager for peace, and the Chinese people love peace even more. Yesterday, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's speech stated that "for the sake of world peace, the Soviet Union is always prepared to maintain friendly cooperation with large and small countries that love peace." The Chinese government and people fully agree with this. Former US Vice President Wallace once said when he came to China years ago that the length of the border between China and the Soviet Union can only be compared to the border between the United States and Canada, and he hoped that the border between China and the Soviet Union would be as sufficient as the border between the United States and Canada to promote understanding and cooperation between the two countries. We also truly hope that this long border can be like the border between the United States and Canada, where there is never any need for defense. The "East Mongolia Republic" that has appeared in the Northeast and the "East Turkestan Republic" in Xinjiang, we certainly believe that there is no support from the Soviet Union in them, but the former appears in the Soviet military-occupied area, and the latter appears in an area closely adjacent to the Soviet border, which is ultimately unavoidable as a dark cloud in a bright atmosphere. China needs peace, but it also needs security. China needs democracy, but it also needs unity. Peace, security, democracy, and unity all require a complete China.

### US Military Also Responsible for Sending Japanese Nationals in Northeast Back to Their Country; General Wedemeyer Answers Reporters' Questions

[Our newspaper] At 11:00 AM yesterday, General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US Military China Theater, received Chinese and foreign reporters at the Construction Building. He gave detailed answers to various questions regarding the Northeast. Wedemeyer also stated that he expects the Chinese army to enter the Northeast in about a month.

A reporter present asked: Will the US also handle the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces? General Wei said that the United States also has the responsibility of sending Japanese nationals back to their country in the Northeast and will provide the same transportation and other tools. The United States will provide assistance in areas north of 16 degrees latitude, such as Hainan Island and Taiwan. From the time of Japan's surrender to the period of US President Truman's statement on Far Eastern policy, the US has sent a total of 25,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians back by the US. It is now advancing to 360,000 people. At the same time, the US military is investigating the situation of the Japanese army in the Northeast through official and legitimate procedures to lay the foundation for carrying out the mission. However, the most important aspects of sending people back are the problems of transportation and food. This depends on whether the Chinese side has the ability to control transportation and food. And I hope that this can be resolved within a month.

No News of Soviet Withdrawal

Regarding the matter of journalists going to the Northeast to work, General Wei himself believes that if reporters from every country can be in the Northeast and report the facts fully, it would be an excellent thing. However, he has not received any response at the moment and is also inconvenient to promote this matter. He also has not received news about the withdrawal of Soviet troops in the Northeast. The US military is currently busy with transporting the New Sixth Army, sending Japanese nationals back, and has no time to take care of other less important matters. However, official information about the situation of the Japanese army is being obtained. He knows nothing about the rumors that Japanese soldiers and civilians in the three northeastern provinces have withdrawn to the Soviet Union.

Striving to Reduce US Military in China

When asked about the number and date of personnel coming to China to take over in the next three months, and the news that about 4,500 US troops will return home, General Wei felt difficult to answer this kind of unconfirmed report. He briefly said: I have previously reported that "perhaps" about 4,000 US troops will return home, but I did not say "definitely." After the families of US troops received unconfirmed reports, they often sent letters to inquire, which not only made it difficult for me to handle matters, but also made the US military department in Washington inconvenient. I will now give a general answer, that is, I will strive to reduce the US military in all parts of China, only seeking a sufficient number to carry out the work. Personnel who have achieved high scores will naturally return home according to the scheduled plan.

US Advisory Group Assists in Building the Military

The US Military Advisory Group in China has not yet been established. If it is established, its job will be entirely to assist China in building the navy, army, and air force. However, all service personnel are volunteers, and of course, a small number of them must have experience serving here to provide guidance. If the advisory group is established, the navy and army will be formed separately, but the heads of both sides will cooperate with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to facilitate the progress of the work.

General Wei said that there is no such thing as rumors that the US Army will withdraw completely and the Navy will carry out all tasks. If the Military Advisory Group is established, there will be more and more important army personnel than naval personnel. This rumor may have been caused by Admiral Cooke's visit to Chongqing. In fact, Admiral Cooke's visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was purely a courtesy visit, and there was no jealousy between the navy and army.

Restoring Official Ranks After the End of the War

General Wei said that US military officers are now being demoted, and that most officers were promoted during the war. Now that the war is over, they will return to their previous ranks. I received a list from Washington stating when a certain person should return to their previous rank and execute it. However, there are also some officers who will not be demoted.

A reporter asked that two Japanese war criminals who were captured in Japan this time in connection with the murder of three pilots under General Doolittle, one had been sent and one was still in Japan. When will he come to China? General Wei said that it was inconvenient to answer why he was left in Japan. General MacArthur and I cooperated very well. If General MacArthur thinks that this other war criminal should be left in Japan, there must be his reasons, and I think this move is quite reasonable.

### He Zhuguo Goes Blind, Will Go to the US for Treatment

General He Zhuguo, the former commander of the 15th Army Corps, suddenly went blind. Medical treatment in Chongqing was ineffective. He took a flight from Chongqing to Shanghai a few days ago for diagnosis and treatment, waiting for a ship to go to the United States for medical treatment.

### Xue Yue and Chennault Visit President Song

At 10:00 AM yesterday, President Song received General Xue Yue, China Merchants Bureau President Xu Xueyu, and Liu Hongsheng at the Executive Yuan Office in the Bank of China Building. At around 4:00 PM, he received General Chennault and several people from foreign trade.

### Visiting Zuo Shunsheng

— Cang Long

"My personal view has always been that the interests of the nation come first, the interests of the people second, the common interests of the international community third, and the interests of political parties fourth. There's no point in overemphasizing the interests of political parties..."

Wearing a blue cloth robe, cloth warm shoes, and hair without the nourishment of oil wax, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, with his long, round face and seven-part seriousness, gave me the impression of a Chinese commoner. After the reporter extended his hand for a handshake and explained his purpose, he immediately asked him to express some political views. A few smiles appeared on his serious face. After a moment of silence, he finally said:

"I did not participate in the Political Consultative Conference this time, but I know the details of the process very well. Now the conference has already reached a conclusion, and the Constitutional Drafting Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 14th of this month."

"The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of this year, and the steps for drafting and implementing the constitution will be separated. How the next National Assembly will be convened after this National Assembly is convened depends on how this constitutional draft is stipulated."

"As far as I know, all parties have conducted lengthy research and exchanged opinions on this constitutional draft. In the past, there were the Constitutional Government Promotion Association and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association. Both of these associations were convened by the government, and I participated in them. All parties also exchanged opinions."

"This time, the Political Consultative Conference also discussed the constitutional draft. After exchanging opinions, several principles have been passed. The Constitutional Drafting Committee, which is about to be convened, will further discuss these passed principles. I believe that this review committee will have results quickly. Therefore, in terms of realizing democracy and implementing constitutional government, I think it is quite optimistic." He lit a cigarette, took two puffs, and fully revealed his confident expression.

"Generally speaking, from the passage of the constitution to the formation of a government based on the constitution, this so-called transitional period will not be too short. I think if the government reorganization is completed and all parties can unite sincerely and show results in promoting democracy, then peaceful unification is very hopeful, and there will be no more civil wars."

"I very much recognize that the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Youth Party, and the Democratic League all have a common understanding, that is, they must unite, unify, democratize, and achieve peace. Since the common understanding of all parties is the same, then after the government is reorganized, there will be relatively satisfactory results for all parties." His views on this aspect seemed to have come to a small conclusion, and his focus immediately shifted to the point of nationalizing the army.

"Regarding the issue of the nationalization of the army, all parties are very concerned, and international friends are also very concerned about this and are very enthusiastic in helping. On this issue, the CCP has the same understanding as other parties, that is to say, China needs a large-scale reduction in troops because the country's total budget for this year, the military expenditure accounts for almost half. If it is not a large-scale reorganization and reduction, then the country's construction and finance will encounter difficulties. Therefore, on this issue, I hope that the CCP can fulfill its promise to temporarily reduce the army to twenty divisions. Then, it will not be difficult to initially solve the problem and achieve the goal of nationalizing the army."

Finally, Mr. Zuo ended his speech in a solemn and sharp tone. He said: "This time, the reorganization of the government, the convening of the National Assembly, and how the quotas of all parties will be allocated, as long as everyone attaches great importance to the interests of the country and the interests of the people, and clearly understands the international environment, then these problems will not be difficult to solve..." Then, he expressed his usual views on the order of importance of national, people's, and party interests.

At the time of departure, he told me that he was preparing to publish a "China Times," which could be published as early as March. He himself may visit Nanjing, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places within a month to consolidate and connect the youth party headquarters in various places that have lost contact for eight years.

### British Cruiser with Distinguished War Record Captain Warn Invites Inspection

[Our Newspaper's Report] The British cruiser "Euryalus" sailed to Shanghai from Hong Kong ten days ago to replace the flagship "Belfast." Captain Warn specially invited Chinese and foreign reporters from this city to visit at 2:00 PM yesterday. The ship's name comes from three famous Euryalus figures in ancient times, all of whom were known for their heroic deeds. This ship bearing its name is the fifth. It went to sea for combat in June 1941 and is a Dido-class 5,500-ton light cruiser, equipped with eight 5.25-inch caliber cannons, twelve anti-aircraft guns, seventeen machine guns, and three torpedoes. Each torpedo weighs one and a half tons, and sailors specially opened the tubes and pulled them out for visitors to inspect. From September 1941 to March 1942, the ship performed great deeds in the Mediterranean. Under continuous bombing by German aircraft, it supplied Malta with food and ammunition. One battle with the powerful Italian fleet resulted in one of the most glorious battles in British naval history. In December 1944, it sailed to the Far East and joined the British Pacific Fleet for combat, becoming one of the first warships to attack the southern overseas islands of Japan, and then attacked the Japanese mainland.

The ship can carry more than 600 officers and soldiers. During wartime, there was no time to take care of the interior, so it is currently repairing and cleaning machinery and the hull. After several weeks, once the relief ship arrives, it will sail to Hong Kong or Japan.

### Major Speculators Squeeze the Market, Gold Shops Absorb Supply Gold Prices Soar, Once Exceeding 130,000 Mark

Yesterday, gold prices initially appeared weak due to low quotations from the wartime capital, but major speculators re-engaged in a market squeeze, resulting in aggressive purchases by northern merchants and gold shops. Those short on contracts became visibly panicked. After initially falling, a sharp rebound occurred as a short squeeze took hold. Under the leadership of major speculators, buying momentum surged. The market opened lower at 1.19 million, but bank sales continued. The price fell below 1.16 million, which the gold shops took advantage of to absorb supply and maintain prices. Major speculators in the industry saw an opportunity and coordinated to push prices up, quickly breaking through the 1.2 million mark again. Later, the market briefly retreated from above 1.23 million to 1.197 million, but with the short squeeze in full swing, northern merchants aggressively bought, and the price rose again to above 1.27 million before slightly receding. The morning session closed at 1.246 million, up 26,000 from the previous close. In the afternoon, the spot price initially fell slightly from 1.265 million to around 1.24 million, but as next-day delivery transactions gradually increased, various buy rumors arose due to the Soviet army's delayed withdrawal from the Northeast. Sentiment was extraordinarily strong, and industry participants rushed to buy, pushing the price from 1.265 million to around 1.322 million. Finally, it hovered around the 1.3 million mark. Gold ornaments were priced as high as 140,000, silver 1,200, and silver coins 730 yuan. Illegal exchange rates were slightly higher due to tight money supply, ranging from 0.12 to 0.14.

The initial exchange rate for US dollars was 1,680 yuan, but it slightly declined to 1,650 yuan following the gold market. As gold prices rebounded, arbitrage buying surged, rising to 1,760 yuan. It hovered around 1,730 yuan at noon and rose to 1,780 yuan in the afternoon, eventually closing at 1,770 yuan. The difference was pulled to above 730, entirely passive due to a lack of speculative activity. Hong Kong dollars were slightly stronger after initially being flat. Old notes rose by 10 yuan, and new notes by 2 yuan.

### Although There Was Some Profit-Taking, Stock Prices Continued to Rise Sharply

Chinese stocks continued to advance yesterday with great momentum. Yongsha opened at 2,550 yuan, then fluctuated from 2,730 yuan to 2,660 yuan, and then rose to 2,820 yuan in the morning. The high price led to profit-taking, and it fell back to 2,730 yuan at noon. A tall tree attracts the wind, and high prices were difficult to sustain. Maya rose from 1,850 yuan to 2,170 yuan, and closed at 2,100 yuan at noon. Jingfu failed to break through the 14 yuan mark. Overall, Yongsha rose by 170 yuan, Maya by 150 yuan, and Xinhuo by 120 yuan compared to the previous close. The "Three Small" rose by 9 to 12 yuan, while the rise of unpopular stocks was also extremely sharp.

After foreign stocks rose, old bulls sold off. Stock firms were unable to support further price increases due to tight money supply, causing prices to retreat slightly from their highs. Yisha reached a high of 6,900 yuan, Jardine Matheson 16,500 yuan, and British United 9,000 yuan, all falling back. At noon, Yisha, Jardine Matheson, Yinglian, and other popular stocks had risen by 15% to 20% compared to the previous day, but selling orders were more prevalent.

### Bond Market Stable

Government bonds were initially flat but then strengthened, although major players gradually shifted their attention to other markets. The performance was not as eye-catching as gold and stocks. Apart from Class C bonds, high prices for miscellaneous brands proved unsustainable. The highest price was 2,370 yuan, and the lowest was 2,140 yuan. The afternoon close was 2,270 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Classes A and B rose by 60 yuan, Class C by 50 yuan, Class D by 100 yuan, and Class E by 30 yuan. The price differences slightly narrowed.

### Rice Prices Soar

Rice prices are rising due to the continuous increase in gold prices, causing sellers to be very firm. Inland prices are also rising, leading to further increases. Japonica rice rose by another 600-700 yuan, and Xiangu Baiyuan skyrocketed by 1,000 yuan. Flour sales were active, rising by another 400 yuan. The oil market also experienced soaring prices due to demand exceeding supply, rising by over 4,000 yuan. Soybeans also increased by 300-500 yuan. However, raw peanuts saw little change. Soybean cake was slightly firm, rising by 200-300 yuan.

### Yarn Market Demand Exceeds Supply All Brands Set New Prices

The yarn market continued to see strong price increases yesterday. As weaving factories gradually resumed operations, the demand for raw materials was very strong. Dealers firmly held onto their stocks, as the purchases made by colleagues from the textile and construction company in the past two days were not enough to satisfy their appetite. This led to a situation where demand exceeded supply. Medium and small-sized 20-count yarns were particularly strong. Brands such as Xing Shi and Feima have reached 720,000, a huge increase of 60,000 from the previous day. The 20-count Lanfeng saw transactions at 780,000, also up 40,000. The prices of other coarse yarns and threads were also rising. The situation was extremely urgent, and all brands reached new highs. Textile and construction company prices for 20-count and below remained the same as the previous day, but fine yarns were raised again.

### Spot Cotton Demand Remains Strong

Spot cotton trading remained active yesterday. The market continued to be firm as factories had strong demand, mainly for fine-grade cotton. American cotton (Midelin) was delivered to factories for 78,000 to 80,000 yuan, and Huoji cotton was delivered to warehouses for 53,000 to 55,000 yuan, each rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

### Woollen Fabric Red List Rises Sharply

Woollen fabric red lists were mostly released by various firms yesterday. Due to various environmental factors and the high closing prices last December, all of them rose sharply. Summer goods such as Paristine, Feather Yarn Cloth, Wan Lieding, Yuancang Serge, Huar Dunn, and Light Gray Thin Flower Cloth were the most prominent. The red list prices for western suit linings such as French Xichen, Black Charcoal lining, Fancy Cloth Sleeve Lining Silk, and Mercerized Feather Yarn Soft lining were also higher than in the past. Only outdated goods such as overcoat cloth, riding breeches cloth, Tuosijin, and long-haired velvet were quoted at lower prices.

### Coal Dust Rises in Price: Rumor Spreads of Goods Confiscated at Station; Discount Coal Sales to Begin Tomorrow

The initial opening of coal dust [market] saw factories gradually expand their intake. All felt that the actual goods on the market were insufficient, so prices were very tight. Later, it was heard that fellow businesses had purchased a large amount of coal dust, about thirty to forty cars, from Bengbu, Nanjing, and other places. Although they have now arrived in Shanghai, they were temporarily confiscated at the Shanghai Maigen Road Station for unknown reasons, causing a commotion in the market and rising prices. White coal dust and hand-operated coal ball manufacturers are still actively searching, but the market is short on goods, and the price continues to rise. The downward trend of white coal chunks is difficult to reverse, and the retail of white coal nuggets remains strong, with stable prices.

In other news, the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to prepare for the allocation of coal for citizens' cooking, ordered the coal and coal ball industry associations to organize a "People's Livelihood Coal Management Office." Its first batch of discount sales is scheduled to begin tomorrow (the 10th) in the Xujiahui district. It stipulates that each household holding a December 1945 electricity bill can purchase 50 jin of Shanxi anthracite small and medium-sized coal at 40 yuan per jin. The discount sales locations are: (1) 489 Ladu Road, (2) 224 Stesdelang Road, (3) 1 Jiaxiyi Road.

### Cotton Cloth Rises by 30%: Textile Construction Company Also Increases Prices

After the Spring Festival holiday, private dyeing and weaving factories had generally completed preparations for factory equipment. However, due to the extremely weak inventory of grey cloth, they fully expected the China Textile Construction Company to universally open sales of cotton cloth to registered member manufacturers in order to reduce production costs. However, the China Textile Construction Company has recently opened sales of a small amount of bleached cloth, grey light twill, yuan light twill, etc., at prices higher than the market. As a result, market cloth prices have increased by about 30% compared to the previous year. Therefore, if the China Textile Construction Company continues to delay opening sales of grey cloth, it will not only stimulate cloth price increases and affect manufacturers, but also affect the lives of workers. It is reported that the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association plans to apply to the company to quickly open sales of grey cloth.

In other news, the China Textile Construction Company yesterday announced prices for yuan light twill and bleached cloth. Here are the recorded cloth prices: yuan light twill 30,000 yuan, grey light twill 28,000 yuan, camel grey twill 28,000 yuan, bleached cloth 51,000 yuan. The opening price of bleached cloth is more than 10% higher than comparable products on the market.

### Hardware Transactions Gradually Become Active

Since the opening of the hardware business on the 6th, purchases by factories on this street have gradually become active. Goods such as black iron sheet, drawn wire, foreign yuan, etc., have all been traded, and the market is about 20% better than at the end of last month. As for customer traffic, it still remains to be seen.

### Nanjing Municipal Government Rescues Out-of-School Children: Plans to Build Elementary School Buildings, Submitting a Request to the Executive Yuan for a Special Appropriation of 1.5 Billion

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 8th] Many elementary and middle school buildings in Nanjing were damaged during the war, and many that were not destroyed are currently occupied by military agencies. According to the current situation, school-age children cannot be accommodated. After the return to the capital, the number of school-age children will inevitably increase. In order to rescue out-of-school children and enable them to receive universal education, the municipal government has formulated a plan to submit a request to the Executive Yuan for a special appropriation of 1.5 billion to build elementary school buildings.

### Recent News on School Buildings in the Capital: Most Schools at All Levels Have Not Resumed Classes at Their Original Sites

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the construction and revitalization of education is an urgent matter. In the capital's education, recovery depends on funding, and school buildings are also a prerequisite. The situation of school buildings at all levels is briefly described below:

Higher Education

Regarding the school buildings of colleges and universities of higher education: (1) Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Donggua City, Nanjing, served as a refugee area for Nanjing citizens during the war, accommodating many refugees, especially women. During the atrocities committed by enemy troops entering Nanjing, the college relied on the assistance of Western professors staying in Nanjing to protect the chastity of many women. Although inhabited by refugees, the buildings were fortunately preserved after the war. The school is currently running a middle school, and the university can resume after the summer. (2) The Ginling University school building in Gulou is currently borrowed by the Temporary University Preparatory Class. It will be returned after the Temporary University Preparatory Class concludes in the summer, and Ginling University can also resume school after the summer. (3) Central University at Sipailou, Chengxian Street, has recovered a portion of the main building from military and political agencies. Negotiations are currently underway to transfer the buildings of the Agricultural College of Central University in Sanpailou, and they will be recovered soon. Currently, the Temporary University Preparatory Class is borrowing the gymnasium of Central University for office and classroom use on a limited basis. The class will end in the summer, and Central University will also resume school after the summer.

Secondary Education

The school buildings of private schools, such as Zhongying, Yuqun, Huiwen, Mingde, Yecheng, Ginling Girls' High School, and Zhonghua Girls' High School, were not destroyed. Anfeng and Dongfang were partially destroyed. Zhongnan was largely destroyed. Municipal schools, such as the Municipal Normal School building at the porridge factory outside the South Gate, were completely destroyed, and the Second Middle School building in Zizhu Forest was demolished. Therefore, as a temporary measure, many schools are borrowing school buildings to hold classes. For example, Municipal First Middle School has been relocated to Baixia Road (the original buildings on Fuxi Street are being negotiated for recovery and will soon be returned to the original school; all the buildings on Baixia Road are used as offices by the Capital District Court). At the same time, a branch school will be established in the former Shengping Bridge Elementary School (Zhengshi Middle School has been merged into it). Second Middle School is borrowing Gulou Elementary School. Third Middle School Vocational School is holding classes in the Wesley Church on Shengzhou Road.

Thoughts

### Education Leads Politics

— Yang Tongfang

Recently, I read Lin Han's educational thought, "Which Road Does Politics Take?" in "Ping Lun," and Mr. Da's "Is Education the Tail of Politics?" I feel that the arguments are pertinent and worthy of attention. Education and politics are inherently intertwined and cannot be separated. The ideals of education can only be realized through the power of politics; and the advancement of politics can only be effective through the power of education. Plato emphasized the relationship between education and politics in his "Republic." Many educators in Greece at that time were almost all practically engaged in politics, and the performance in politics coincided with the educational thought of that era. There were also many scholars who included education in politics, believing that politics itself is education. Politics is the affair of the people, and governance is management. Managing the affairs of the people is politics. To put it more progressively, politics contains the meaning of leadership and instruction. Subordinating the meaning of education to politics does not neglect education, but rather expands the connotation of education.

However, many people misunderstand these two aspects, believing that education inherently has no power, and politics determines all educational effects. Their mistake lies in neglecting the meaning of education, which has fundamentally shaken people's belief in education. They feel that politics has unlimited power, and they have seen that in many countries, education has long lost its decisive role and simply follows politics. Like the education of the three major aggressor countries in the past, Germany, Japan, and Italy, it showed a very strong fascist political color everywhere. If their education were to depart from the political concepts of fascist rule, it would have no other meaning at all. Indeed, education, under certain circumstances, is often used by ambitious politicians, because adding a pleasing educational coat to the outside of extremely despicable politics can deceive people everywhere. Education is a form of cultural flower, and it is often regarded as a "political cover." It is clearly a fascist culture of aggression, but ambitious politicians can add the appealing phrase "military national education." It seems that there is a reason to say that politics determines all the effects of education.

Furthermore, from a factual perspective, the power of politics is, after all, greater than that of education. Sometimes, without the power of politics, education simply becomes a piece of empty paper. In modern European and American advanced countries, the implementation of their education relies heavily on the power of politics. Their constitutions stipulate the goals and ideals of educational implementation, and their politics also reflect their educational goals and ideals. Even in this situation, we can only say that education and politics are closely related, or, to put it more thoroughly, their politics have implemented their educational thoughts; and we can never say that their education follows politics. Take the United States as an example. Their politics is a progressive democratic politics of "government of the people, by the people, and for the people," but their democratic thought was conceived in education. As Professor Kilpatrick said: "Good politics must be the result of the implementation of correct educational thought, without correctness." At first glance, this seems to be defending education, but it is not entirely true. Education represents a central idea of politics. Without the leadership of a central idea, politics is inevitably blind.

Now, the aggressor countries have been defeated by the United Nations, who fought to defend world peace. In today's world, where public reason triumphs over might and justice triumphs over hegemony, we no longer hope that people will misunderstand the role of education. Education should lead politics forward with correct central ideas, so that politics can have a way, and the country can have a way. Of course, in a certain sense, we cannot deny that politics has its power. However, we can assert that the power of politics must be exerted under the condition that it can reflect and express educational thought.

Currently, the call for implementing constitutional government and democratic politics is shaking the whole country. First of all, we hope that everyone will recognize the meaning of education, establish the thought of true democratic education, and implement the true purpose of democratic education. Democratic politics will never use education as a cover, and democratic politics must accept progressive educational thought as the foundation of its theory. Democratic thought in education should be the highest leadership of democratic spirit in politics, and the democratic spirit in politics is entirely a reflection of democratic thought in education. In this way, education and politics are interconnected, and the construction of democratic countries can lay a solid foundation.

A true educator must be a rational thinker and a clear-headed practitioner. If those engaged in politics can grasp the core of his thought and reflect it in politics and express it in politics, it is equivalent to building a bridge between theory and practice.

Education is by no means an appendage of politics, and education is not the tail of politics. Education truly has the great role of leading politics. As for why education needs the power of politics to have significant effects, we must recognize that this is all a means, a method. The purpose of education, the ideals of education, undoubtedly still lie in education itself. In any case, education should lead politics.

### Interesting Anecdotes of the Labor Movement

— Mao Shukui

Over two thousand eight hundred employees of the electric company, since the beginning of their slowdown strike, have gathered at the Yangshupu Power Plant. On January 31st, around 4 p.m., a "Wife Retrieval Group" of over a hundred people suddenly appeared, seeking to take their "husbands" home. About one-tenth of them were women, but when asked for the names of the "husbands" they sought, they were all dumbfounded, only saying, "Ask the group leader."

When the labor strike in the city's barbering industry began to spread, the Western District's tea-barber shops continued to operate as usual. After being discovered by the union's patrol team, they gathered dozens of workers and stormed into the shop, inviting them to join the strike. Instantly, all the employees were rushed away. At that time, the shop was full of guests, who, seeing the bad situation, all rushed out with disheveled hair. One young woman, whose perm was not yet finished, had her hair still hanging from the machine. She couldn't break free urgently and was afraid of electric shock, so she dared not move haphazardly. She was in a state of embarrassment and anxiety, and she shouted for help. By the time the shop owner returned to release her, more than half of her hair was burnt.

Most of the labor disputes that occurred this time involved labor demanding money from capital. However, the Cantonese cuisine workers uniquely demanded that the capitalists not demand money from the labor. The reason is that the wine and food workers have never had much in the way of salary or stipend, relying solely on tips and gratuities. Because tip income is quite generous, the capitalists also want to take a share, even without transparency, or even with private deductions. Therefore, the workers collectively shouted, "The tips are ours!"

On Lunar New Year's Eve, the nineteen arrested representatives of the electric company workers were released on bail after a petition by all the workers of the factory. At 10 p.m., Zhang Zhenyuan, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, filled in the names of ten temporary representatives on the bail bond. The first name was Ding Buyun, and the last name was Qi Denggao. Since the next day was the Lunar New Year's Day, it could truly be called an auspicious omen. Therefore, the news reporters who followed to interview on empty stomachs were all overjoyed and refreshed, and they all said, "Section Chief Zhang has worked hard and made great achievements. Next year, his career will be prosperous, and he will rise steadily, step by step, to higher positions."

When the Four Thousand Unemployed Workers of sixty-two units including the Fourth District Mechanical Industry Union, petitioned the Municipal Government, Zhou Xuexiang, the representative of the General Labor Union, and Yue Banfu of the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the Holy Trinity Church Square in the workers' rest area to explain to all the workers. The workers raised various requests, asking for answers, for two hours. Later, Zhao was left as a guarantee, while Zhou went to the Economic Bureau to ask for instructions. Zhou left and never returned, so Zhao continued to be detained for more than an hour before he could escape. Gasping for breath, he told reporters, "Mr. Zhou used a golden cicada sloughing off its shell, using me as collateral."

### Introducing Our Culture to the Outside World

— Zhou Tianshou

——To the Comrades of Woodcuts

Zamenhof exhausted his efforts to create Esperanto, considered to have adopted the common points of various national languages. However, this so-called Esperanto is only a newly created language, and cannot be understood at a glance by the world. Otherwise, even though I don't understand Mayakovsky's Russian original version of "Shout," I wouldn't have to rely solely on Wan Shisi's translation from Esperanto. But similarly, I don't understand German, but I can understand the bitterness of the working masses under the high pressure of the fascist dictatorship in Germany from Käthe Kollwitz's prints such as "Unemployment," "The Children are Hungry," and "Death and the Woman." I can't read Belgian, but I can also see from Masereel's "My Confession" and "The Pursuit of Light" how the Belgian petty bourgeoisie lives in the pursuit of beautiful ideals, how uneasy they are with the status quo, and how they yearn for contemplation!

Therefore, I say that this is the real world language.

Westerners often despise us because they don't understand us, which leads to misrepresentation. Under their uneven lenses, what strange images do our culture, life, and ideological trends present! However, in the 20th century, are we still asking Westerners to infer Oriental civilization from Marco Polo's Travels in the East, in the hope of understanding us?

However, there are too few books that can be directly studied. When they read Gleb's "New China," they run to China only to be driven away. Other reports made by so-called China experts mostly distort the facts under isolated emotions. Introducing our culture to the outside world, who says it's not an urgent task?

How to introduce it? Translating various domestic masterpieces into Western languages ​​is of course indispensable, but while busy with the translation of Chinese works, please don't forget that woodcuts are a useful propaganda tool. It has no national boundaries, is a real "world language" that makes people understand at a glance. It is with simple colors, simple pictures, diverse descriptions, nakedly, unreservedly, and universally telling everything about us to all people who do not understand Chinese.

Fortunately, our woodcut art has caught up with international standards from being hasty and childish. In the diligent study and ardent criticism of comrades, the creation of national forms has also had an accurate definition.

Work hard, comrades of woodcuts, work with your love for the motherland, and introduce our culture to the outside world.

### New Language for Rock-Paper-Scissors

(1) Unifying the country (6) The army rises up bravely

(3) The Three Principles of the People (8) Eight years of victory

(4) Exercising four powers (9) Saving our country

The other day, I went to a friend's house for a New Year's dinner. When the wine was strong, there was rock-paper-scissors game. Seeing that the boxing terms used by several old people were all felt to be outdated, I wrote these new words for the first New Year's dinner after the victory, as a permanent memorial.

### The Sanjiang Public Association Serves Overseas Chinese: Voluntarily Forwarding Mail Between China and the United States

The Sanjiang Public Association in New York, USA, is an organization jointly organized by overseas Chinese from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and the Yangtze River Basin. In the past, due to traffic congestion, it was inconvenient to communicate with each other. Overseas Chinese in the United States were deeply concerned about their families in China. In addition, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, fellow villagers had been away from their hometowns for many years, and their families moved, and their addresses often changed. Home letters sent from the United States could not be delivered and were returned, resulting in a break in contact. In order to facilitate mutual communication, the Association hereby announces that all fellow villagers in China who have relatives and friends in the United States should write to the following address, and the Chinese name of the recipient must be written on the envelope for voluntary delivery. If the letter cannot be delivered, the Association will also explain the reasons and reply, so as to avoid mutual distrust. This is specially announced.
