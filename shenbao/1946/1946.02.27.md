### Foreign Exchange Rate Announcement on Monday / Pei Tsu-yi Appointed President of the Central Bank / National Government Issued Order Yesterday Approving Yu Hung-chun's Resignation from Concurrent Post / President Song Arrived in Shanghai by Plane from Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] After the Supreme National Defense Council approved the opening of the foreign exchange market, the market prices of gold and banknotes in Chongqing immediately plummeted. The price of gold fell by 17,800 yuan per tael today, with the closing price for factory bars at 13,500 yuan, and U.S. dollars at 1,940 yuan. The Central Bank will announce foreign exchange rates on March 4 (Monday). (The "Provisional Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange" is published in full on the fourth page; please refer to it.)

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] The National Government issued an order on the 26th: Yu Hung-chun, concurrently the president of the Central Bank, requested to resign. Yu Hung-chun's request to be relieved of his concurrent post is approved. This order. Pei Tsu-yi is specially appointed as the president of the Central Bank. This order.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Chinese and foreign business figures here have expressed their welcome for the new foreign exchange regulations set by the government. A certain merchant said: This regulation has already achieved half the effect of stabilizing China's monetary system. General opinion holds that the new regulations are intended to allow the exchange rate to automatically find its level after trade is restored. The purposes of the new regulations are, first, to prevent the escape of capital; second, to curb speculation; and third, to encourage exports.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] President Song flew from Chongqing to Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 26th. According to a telegram from Hankou, President Song arrived in this city by plane at approximately 6:00 PM on the 26th. Due to inclement weather, he landed here and is scheduled to continue his flight to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th.

[Our Newspaper Report] After the news that the Supreme National Defense Council had approved the opening of the foreign exchange market was revealed, the market prices of gold, foreign currencies, securities, etc., in this city were quite shaken. General speculation is that, with the opening of foreign exchange trading, foreign trade is expected to resume, and perhaps a more favorable exchange rate can be obtained as a result. However, some are taking a wait-and-see attitude because the classification methods for new imported goods have not yet been announced, and they are uncertain about the extent of the application and permit procedures that the government will adopt. As a result, the general market situation was quite volatile when the news was first released, but eventually, there was a uniform decline. Gold saw a low price of 1.46 million, and U.S. dollars once saw a minimum price of 2,330 yuan. Other markets, such as Chinese and foreign stock markets and price markets, all declined, which shows that the authorities' new foreign exchange measures have had a preliminary stabilizing effect on the Shanghai market. A reporter visited the person in charge of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, who said: The authorities' plan to open the foreign exchange market has only been seen in the newspapers, and the office has not yet received instructions from the authorities. However, he firmly believes that detailed implementation measures will be issued soon, and they will be handled accordingly to achieve the central government's aim of stabilizing finance and leveling prices. According to general observation: In the future, the government will allow the people to purchase and import goods needed for industry and people's livelihoods at any time without the government's permission, which will be of great benefit to the development of domestic industry and the future of the national economy. Moreover, the government will have the Central Bank and designated banks assess market conditions and supply and demand realities to provide appropriate adjustments for the supply and purchase of foreign exchange, so that transitional fluctuations can be prevented. The buying and selling of foreign currency banknotes and gold will also be handled according to the same principle, and 500 million U.S. dollars will be allocated as legal tender reserves. In the future, the government can fully utilize its open market trading policy to achieve the significant effect of stabilizing the financial market. Therefore, it is expected that the market conditions of foreign exchange, foreign currencies, gold, securities, etc., will gradually be brought into line, and prices will become more stable, and foreign trade, which has been uncertain, can embark on a smooth path.

### Mediation Department Protests / Petition Group Incident

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The protest letter, signed by Zheng Jiemin, Ye Jianying, and Robertson, three commissioners of the Military Mediation Department, was delivered to the Beiping Municipal Government on the 21st. It lodged a serious protest against the entry of over a thousand petitioners from the Hebei refugee group on the 20th, who crowded into the department, shouting, fighting, and hindering work. It demanded that Mayor Xiong take appropriate and effective measures to ensure the safety and freedom of the department's government, CCP, and U.S. offices, residences, and staff, so that the department can have the conditions to continue its peace work. The three commissioners solemnly stated in the protest letter that, at the time of submitting the protest letter, they fully understood and respected all the freedom of rights of the people, and had no intention of opposing or interfering. In addition, the three commissioners also telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting him to order the relevant authorities to fulfill their responsibility to protect the department. The Military Mediation Department may issue a public statement on this matter in the next two days.

### Chairman Will Go to Chongqing Suburbs and Nanjing Today / Give Instructions to Political School Students / Negotiations with the Soviet Union Based on Treaties

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] Chairman Chiang summoned the Secretary-General and Yu Dingchang at 3:15 PM today. The content of the conversation was reportedly related to the current general situation. According to reliable information: Chairman Chiang will go to Nanquan on the 27th to give instructions to the students of the political school and listen to their opinions on national affairs.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] Chairman Chiang sent Chen Lifu to the Central Political School yesterday to dissuade students from marching, because the school is an organization of the Kuomintang, but the students did not listen. According to reports: The gate of Yenching University in Chengdu was destroyed because students of the school did not participate in the first demonstration march. Yenching students fasted for one day on Monday to protest this, but organized a patriotic group to support other students' views on the Northeast issue.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Chairman Chiang issued instructions to the Northeast Headquarters, stipulating that negotiations with the Soviet Union must be based on respect for the Sino-Soviet Treaty, comply with Chinese law, and not contradict other international agreements signed by China. This is a clear indication to the Soviet Union and the world that China will not make any concessions in the Nine Eastern Provinces that would damage China's integrity. However, the general public believes that the clauses of the Sino-Soviet Treaty were actually decided by the Big Three at the Yalta Conference, and China had no choice but to accept them, which is truly infuriating.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] According to the Communist Party here, the Chengdu "Xinhua Daily" office has been destroyed by the "Gestapo." This happened after the Chengdu students' march last Sunday.

### Students Continue to March

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The capital's various circles, in order to demand that the Soviet Union withdraw its troops stationed in the Northeast and oppose the special status of the Northeast, held an unprecedented national salvation demonstration march today in the overcast and drizzling rain. Participants included over 10,000 professors from temporary universities and representatives from the industrial, agricultural, commercial, and academic sectors. Among them, Professor Chen Cangfu, who is in his sixties and marched fourteen years ago because the Northeast was invaded by Japanese imperialism, once again walked among the marchers, which is most touching. The marching crowd followed a band playing the "March of the Volunteers," advancing mightily, and traffic was blocked for a time. They shouted slogans along the way, posted slogans, and gave speeches in groups, their emotions were tense and passionate, and the citizens stood and watched, all feeling inspired and moved. In many places, the masses spontaneously shouted slogans to respond to the roar of the marching crowd. Today's march did not encounter any accidents because the police and military police had made arrangements for protection in advance.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Over 10,000 students in the Nan'an district of Chongqing held a patriotic march today for the Northeast issue. When they arrived at the National Government, they circled the gate once, and thirty representatives presented their opinions on national affairs to Chairman Chiang. Xu Jingzhi, Director of the Document Bureau of the Civil Affairs Office, received them and gave a speech, which stated: Chairman Chiang highly praised the patriotic actions, and earnestly instructed yesterday that students should pay attention to reason on national affairs, and not increase the government's difficulties or damage international friendship. The government has been striving for the complete victory and integrity of China's territory for more than twenty years. Soviet friendship is not only necessary for us, but also a strong guarantee for world peace. Regarding the Northeast issue, the chairman also instructed that solutions should be sought under the principles of not violating government laws and regulations, respecting the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and not undermining national sovereignty and territorial integrity. He hoped that the students would trust the government.

### Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall Will Go to North China / Scheduled for a Five-Day Inspection / May Go to the Northeast After Returning to Beiping from Yan'an

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Marshall is definitely planning to go to the Northeast. The time will be after inspecting various parts of North China. The scope of work of the Military Mediation Department will be expanded to the Northeast, and the working hours will also be extended because he is still responsible for supervising the troop reduction task. Marshall, Zhang, Zhou, etc., may come to Beiping on the 27th or 28th. The areas to be visited by the three have been tentatively set as Jining, Jinan, Zhangjiakou, Xinxiang, and Taiyuan, and they will spend one night in Yan'an. However, the specific route will be decided only after Marshall arrives in Beiping. It is heard that Marshall's and others' North China inspection itinerary is five days. After completing the trip, they will return to Beiping and then go to the Northeast. Marshall may stay at the American Embassy, Zhou will stay at the Beijing Hotel, and Zhang has not yet decided.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The American side has cleaned the houses of the American Embassy for Marshall to stay in. It is learned that the inspection trip of the three, Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall, is scheduled for five days. On the first day, they will inspect Jining and Zhangjiakou. On the second day, they will go to Jinan and Xuzhou. On the third day, they will go to Xinxiang and Taiyuan. On the fourth day, they will go to Yan'an.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 26th] The purpose of the visit to Beiping by Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai is to review the achievements of the Executive Headquarters in the past six weeks and to take the lead in inspecting the actual situation in various conflict areas. The Executive Headquarters has issued 14 joint communiqués in the past six weeks, which in itself can be considered an important achievement. The Executive Headquarters has three main tasks: (1) Fulfilling the order to cease conflict, which is almost complete; (2) Supervising the restoration of transportation in North and Central China, which is also underway; (3) Assisting in the evacuation of Japanese nationals from North China. The Executive Headquarters announced on February 16 that this work had begun.

### Soviet Commander Publicly Admits / Shenyang Machinery Was Moved to the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Shenyang, 25th] General Stankevich, commander of the Soviet garrison in the Shenyang area, admitted to British and American reporters today that the Soviet Union had moved heavy machinery and equipment from several factories in Shenyang. However, Stankevich insisted that this move was fully in line with the agreement previously established by the three powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. When asked in which Three-Power Conference the agreement was established, he replied: "Perhaps in Yalta, or in Berlin, I cannot be sure which conference it came from." General Stankevich is one of the first Soviet officials to publicly acknowledge this matter.

Responding Honestly

Nine foreign reporters suddenly raised the issue during the reception held by General Shi. They had visited several factories in Shenyang without formal approval. Shi Dan-Ke Weiqu initially avoided answering, but after the British and American reporters frankly told him that they had received reports from various sources that the Soviet side had moved heavy machinery, and that they had personally seen a lot of evidence, he answered truthfully. When reporters asked whether most of the machinery had been sent to the Soviet Union, Shi paused for a moment and then replied: "Perhaps so." He also said: "Even in the areas in Europe where the U.S. military is stationed, some enemy military equipment and machinery for manufacturing war equipment are being sent to the Soviet Union." He believed that the situation in the Northeast was the same.

Meeting Interrupted

Just as he had fully acknowledged this hitherto unknown agreement, General Peng Bisheng, commander of the Chinese garrison in the Panyang area, happened to walk into the room, and the meeting quickly came to a short end. When receiving British and American reporters, General Shi Dan-Ke Weiqu declared: Only 10% of the factories in Shenyang are now guarded by Soviet troops, and the remaining 90% are not guarded. He emphasized that the Soviet army's guarding of factories was "to prevent looting by the citizens of Panyang," and he hoped that the Chinese side would quickly establish their own guards. Shi met with reporters in his personal office at his headquarters, wearing medals and looking very much like he was celebrating the Red Army Anniversary, as "most of the Red Army is busy protecting the factories."

Everything is at a Standstill

Shenyang used to be a major industrial city in the Far East and was known as the "Chicago of the Northeast," with a population of over two million. Now, except for producing a little beer, vodka, and cigarettes for the Soviet army's consumption, all production has come to a standstill. Shenyang used to have 4,570 factories, including 948 first- and second-rate factories that Japanese used to run at full capacity during the war to produce automobiles, machinery, airplanes, munitions, machinery, and various textiles. Currently, only 20 are open, of which 15 are managed by Chinese and 5 by Soviets, but all 20 factories are controlled and guarded by the Soviet side. Most of the other factories are just empty shells, or the internal objects have been burned, or the machinery and equipment have been completely moved away, and the remaining remnants have been looted and stolen by scavengers, who have taken away anything of value to try to eke out a living in this filthy and disease-ridden city of death.

National Army Barracks

Twenty factories with empty factory buildings are now being used as barracks for Chinese troops. Every important factory, whether usable or not, is guarded by Soviet troops. Soviet soldiers mostly reside inside the stone walls around the factories to prevent night attacks. Smaller and unimportant factories that have been looted are not guarded by Soviet troops, allowing passersby to enter and pick up firewood, coal pieces, cotton batting, and other fire starters. No factory in the Panyang area is guarded by Chinese troops, even the factories nominally managed by Chinese. A Chinese military officer who accompanied the British and American reporters to inspect the factories told (the reporter claimed): "We do not have any Chinese guards, because the factory buildings are connected to each other and may cause accidents with the nearby Soviet guards, and there are not enough to protect them."

### Editorial: After the Opening of the Foreign Exchange Market

The plan to open the foreign exchange market, along with measures for trade import and export, was simultaneously passed by the Supreme National Defense Council. Its main points can be summarized as follows:

1.  Abolish the current official foreign exchange rate.

2.  Do not stipulate a rate, but adopt the so-called foreign exchange margin method.

3.  Manage foreign exchange and import and export trade.

4.  The Central Bank buys and sells foreign currency, banknotes, and gold in the same way.

5.  The Central Bank may designate several other banks to jointly undertake the above business. These so-called other banks are not required to be Chinese banks.

We generally agree with the above measures, because (1) international trade can be restored from now on; (2) the free flow of goods and the supply and demand of materials can be adequately adjusted; (3) if the Central Bank can truly consider the market situation and buy and sell foreign exchange at any time according to the actual supply and demand, the fluctuations in gold prices and general prices can be expected to gradually slow down; (4) the floating capital in the market has found an outlet; (5) the import of foreign goods is divided into three categories: (A) free, (B) permitted, and (C) prohibited, which is quite in line with the general public's wishes. Therefore, we must say that the above measures were decided too late.

At the same time, there are still a few points that deserve attention. First, there are no strict regulations on foreign exchange other than import and export trade. Then, black market drafts have a source. Also, because C and B import goods are not easy to freely buy foreign exchange, then black market drafts are needed. Second, goods permitted for import and goods prohibited for import, if they need to be imported, of course, must be subject to permission or special approval. As for goods that are freely imported, as the name suggests, should be freely imported. However, when purchasing drafts, proof must be provided to the bank. What are the procedures for this proof? If the Temporary Committee for Import Design plans as a whole, and believes that the quantity and value of imported goods should be "mutually coordinated to avoid duplication and waste," are the items of import and export goods also subject to adjustment? Third, the so-called foreign exchange margin, whether its lower limit is close to the current black market, in order to avoid excessive price shocks, but its upper limit, how far is it? In theory, this margin may be adjusted from time to time after a considerable period of time, in accordance with the market situation and the actual supply and demand, in order to be suitable for the actual situation, rather than being immutable. The main reason why the government does not stipulate the foreign exchange rate, but resolutely adopts the foreign exchange margin, may be this. However, if the change is too easy, speculation will arise, which can stimulate speculation and make the fluctuations in general prices unable to be缓和, and the cost of import and export goods will not be easy to calculate accurately, which has too much impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, this margin should always be grasped and not allowed to be too fluid. Moreover, this margin should not be too wide, so that speculators can still make waves and disrupt the entire economy.

The goods that can be freely imported, as stipulated in Article 2 of the Import and Export Trade Measures, have a wide range. In order to protect our country's fledgling industry, in addition to this method, we also hope to use other methods, such as tariff policies, to make appropriate supplements. Because the lower limit of this foreign exchange margin, if it is close to today's black market foreign exchange rate, then today's prices are already too high. In terms of stabilizing people's livelihood, it is not enough, and the difference between foreign goods prices and domestic goods prices is still far away. In terms of threatening domestic industry, it is still more than enough. Therefore, opening the foreign exchange market is an important point in opening up economic difficulties, but it cannot be considered the only solution to the current economic problem.

As for the management of foreign exchange and the management of import and export trade, there has been considerable experience during the war period. What is the effect, there is no need to criticize now. Fortunately, this time, the Supreme National Defense Council is in charge of its highest supervisory power, and a Temporary Committee for Import Design is set up to be responsible for it. The candidates and their responsibilities are set very carefully. We believe that the various unreasonable and unrealistic phenomena of the past will not be repeated in the future.

### The Soviet Union stated that it has taken steps to thoroughly investigate the Zhang Xinfu tragedy. We are negotiating with the Soviet Union to jointly handle the matter.

[Chongqing Central News Agency, 26th] According to official announcements, regarding the case of Zhang Xinfu and other special commissioners sent to Fushun to take over industrial and mining affairs being killed, Dong Yanping, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Northeast Headquarters, had written to Lieutenant General Trotsenko, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army Headquarters in the Northeast, requesting him to send personnel to investigate. Subsequently, the Chief of Staff replied that the Soviet army had taken all measures and investigated and arrested the criminals. The government attaches special importance to this matter and has re-telegraphed Deputy Chief of Staff Dong Yanping to quickly negotiate with the Soviet Army Headquarters to send capable personnel to the scene to thoroughly investigate the circumstances of the murder and the principal perpetrators, in order to clarify the truth and responsibility.

### Wuhan Increases Number of National Schools; Provides Relief to School-Age Children Out of School

[Our Wuhan Correspondent] The Hankou Municipal Government considers the problem of children out of school in the city to be severe. This month, the number of new students requesting admission is estimated to be around 10,000. According to an investigation by the Education Department, the number of school-age children in the city, calculated according to a certain ratio, is 63,000. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, each class should have 40 students, requiring the establishment of 1,750 classes to accommodate all of them. The current standard for primary school funding is approximately 60,000 yuan per class, requiring a total monthly expenditure of 100.5 million yuan. The municipal government, due to a lack of financial resources, feels unable to subsidize such a large amount of funding for primary schools. At the same time, national education only accounts for one part of the education sector. Other secondary vocational and social education programs also need to be organized. To achieve the overall improvement of education in the future, the municipal government convened a national education symposium yesterday (the 19th) at 2 p.m. in the Municipal Government Conference Hall. The meeting was attended by the directors of the Finance and Police Bureaus, relevant advisors, section chiefs, district administrators, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the standing committee members of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting discussed methods for the municipal government to universally establish national schools. The Education Department also proposed the following items for discussion: (1) Convert all private primary schools in Hankou into national schools; (2) Establish a national school in each district; (3) Funding should be raised by villages and "bao-jia" (ancient Chinese system of civil registration); (4) The Federation of Trade Unions and the Chamber of Commerce should mobilize various trade unions. The number of primary schools and the situation of students out of school were discussed. It was reported that the number of students out of school is over 30,000. The meeting decided to follow the above proposals to solve the problem of school-age children being out of school.

Wuchang: Although the Wuchang area has established five provincial primary schools, their capacity is only over 3,000 students, causing many parents to suffer in recent days because their children cannot attend school. According to officials in charge of national education at the Education Department, according to the central government's orders, primary schools are to be managed by the county and city governments. However, due to relocation and recovery, students are returning to Hankou with their parents, and the municipal organization of Wuchang has not yet been completed. To prevent school-age children from being out of school, the department established five primary schools last year and has plans to continue establishing five more. Due to funding issues, this semester may be difficult to achieve. Currently, the Wuchang Municipal Office is also actively preparing to establish central national schools and national schools in accordance with provincial government orders. In addition, the provincial experimental primary school and the affiliated primary school of the provincial first women's normal school will begin student enrollment soon. The problem of primary school enrollment in Wuchang can be gradually solved.

### Classroom Films: New Teaching Method After the War

[United States Information Service, New York, 25th] Hev writes in the latest issue of "Freedom" magazine that the rapid training of armed forces during World War II led to various new teaching methods, one of which is the use of films in the classroom. Hev explains that before the war, the development of classroom films was very slow, but the training of millions of people in the military required extreme speed, so new teaching methods had to be adopted. The most effective of these was sound films. Therefore, educational films used to teach the armed forces are now being applied to schools. Hev claims that today, schools in all 48 states of the United States are commonly using sound films as a teaching tool. Before showing a film in the classroom, the teacher first describes what the students will see. Then, the students ask questions. In this way, films not only help understanding but also guide creative planning and supplementary reading. However, the teacher is still an important part of this. It is important not to forget that films are just another teaching tool in the hands of the teacher and are used in conjunction with other teaching methods.

### City Primary School Principals' Association Offers Suggestions to the Education Bureau

Therefore, yesterday morning, the association sent six representatives to meet with Director Gu. Deputy Director Li received them. The representatives presented two points of view: (1) salary adjustment, (2) the addition of detailed and reasonable regulations for dismissing teachers. According to Deputy Director Li, the salaries of primary school teachers and staff are based on the salaries of civil servants, so there is no need to apply. As for the regulations for dismissing teachers, in addition to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, education experts, officials in charge, principals, and teachers in this city will discuss them together in the future to supplement any deficiencies.

Three basketball league games will be held today as usual. The women's division game between Da Hua and Strong Hua will start first. The former has four wins in four games and is tied for the lead with the Green Team. Shen Shuwei, Zhou Zhifang, and others are very skilled, so Strong Hua has no chance of avoiding defeat.

In terms of individual skill, the Blue Team is not inferior to Hua Nan, but the team's teamwork seems to be weaker. If Hua Nan can organize its troops today, it should have a chance of winning.

Da Hua - Strong Hua (Women's) 5:30 p.m.

Dong Hua - Red Team (Division 2) 6:15 p.m.

Blue Team - Hua Nan (Division 1) 7:15 p.m.

I dare to guarantee to everyone that under the leadership of the most brilliant Chairman Chiang, the government will never do anything that would cede territory or humiliate the country.

All the points you have requested today will be immediately reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and forwarded to the government for review.

### General Chennault Hosts a Reception for Newspaper Reporters in This City; Emphasizes China's Vast Land and Resources and the Urgent Need to Establish an Aviation Industry; Expresses Willingness to Continue Assisting the Development of Our Air Transportation Industry

[Report from This Newspaper] Former commander of the American 14th Air Force, "Flying Tiger General" Chennault, hosted his first reception for reporters in China yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Le Ee Hotel on Daxilu (now Yan'an West Road). Colonel Shu Boyan, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Aviation Commission, accompanied him. Over twenty reporters from various newspapers attended. During the reception, General Chennault expressed great concern for the development of China's aviation industry and expressed his willingness to contribute to it.

General Chennault stated that after traveling throughout various parts of inland China, he felt that both China's land transportation and air transportation were extremely lacking and urgently needed to be improved. However, it seems impossible to achieve rapid development of land transportation in the short term. Therefore, priority should be given to developing air transportation and operating our own aviation industry. China has abundant materials for building aircraft, which can be fully utilized. In addition, there are many other products that can be sold in foreign markets, but the lack of transportation is a major obstacle. General Chennault contributed this opinion to President Chiang Kai-shek, who greatly approved and adopted it. General Chennault said that he currently has no concrete plans, but has many ideas. He also mentioned that when the July 7th Incident occurred, he was in Luoyang. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he telegraphed President Chiang, expressing his willingness to serve China. President Chiang replied, accepting his opinion, so he immediately went to Nanjing and began training the Chinese Air Force. This time, he came to China again, hoping to do his best to assist the development of China's air transportation industry.

General Chennault said that China has the largest airport in the world, namely the Luliang Airport in Yunnan, which is truly the largest in the world in terms of scale. The importance of air transportation after the war will be equal to or even greater than during the war. He traveled from San Francisco to Shanghai on a regular airplane, taking only fifty-four hours. American commercial airlines are now planning flights from San Francisco, with brief stops in Honolulu and Guam, to Shanghai, which may only take thirty hours. This plan is expected to be realized in July of this year. General Chennault also told reporters that he planned to stay in Shanghai for some time before going to Nanjing.

Commercial News

### Strict Crackdown on Speculation Causes Continued Fall in Gold Prices; Exchange Rate Issues Draw Attention

Yesterday, rumors reported the highest level of the National Defence Council has agreed to release foreign exchange policy news. People's attitude towards foreign exchange and gold quotation issues gradually turned optimistic, market prices continue to appear weak, the early opening had fallen to 1.65 million, selling pressure turned intense, and at the same time the Sichuan Road area was chaotic. The environment was unfavorable, and the price fell to around 1.45 million at noon. The U.S. dollar gradually opened strongly, and low-priced floating capital was absorbed, and the closing price returned to above 1.57 million, a further drop of 150,000 compared with the previous closing. In the afternoon, the U.S. dollar was unsustainable, and the price of gold also slightly decreased. Restrictions were stricter, and transactions were more inactive. Gold jewelry in silver shops still had no quoted prices, silver ingots cost 2,000 yuan, and silver dollars were still oversupplied, falling to around 900 yuan. The black market discount rate loosened, and interest rates were about 15 to 20%.

Yesterday, the U.S. dollar was subject to speculations about exchange rates. Because the government has a complete plan for foreign exchange, a common perception sees 2000 to 1 as possible. Sellers surged for a time, the opening price was 2510 yuan, with ample supply, and the lowest price dropped to below 2350 yuan. The rupee rose in response to cotton settlement, (rising from 520 yuan to 540 yuan) so Hong Kong dollars did not move. The rupee helped boost buying, and the price recovered to above 2400 yuan. As a result, the closing price fell 150 yuan compared with the previous closing. New Hong Kong dollars were flat, old Hong Kong dollars were very stable due to the influence of the rupee, and low prices were not easily obtained. The buying and selling prices were further widened. As a result, in terms of selling prices, old Hong Kong dollars rose slightly, while new Hong Kong dollars fell slightly.

### Securities Decline

Category C public bonds gradually decreased from 1700 yuan to below 1450 yuan, Category E gradually decreased to 1200 yuan, miscellaneous brands traded around 1000 yuan, Chinese stocks also weakened, Yong Yarn retreated from 2200 yuan to near 2000 yuan, Meya decreased from 1700 yuan to around 1600 yuan, and Jingfu retreated from 115 yuan to around 105 yuan, all falling by about 10%. Foreign stocks were forced by the environment, and the selling price was stronger, but the underlying trend was firm. All of this is an estimated price, and it is difficult to obtain more open transactions. Generally, large stocks fell by about 10%, and small stocks were more stable, falling by about 5%.

### Yarn Prices Decline

Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned downward. Because it was reported that the government authorities would soon open up foreign exchange, and at the same time, the price of gold declined, people's minds were weak. The early opening price of 16-count Guangming was 1.03 million, and then it gradually decreased to 900,000. Other yarns, such as 20-count special Shuangma, decreased to 1.08 million. The price of 20-count small yarn has recently been nearly the same as the price of 16-count Guangming, which can be said to be a miracle. However, 16-count Guangming is still more active in trading than 20-count yarn, because the import and export of Guangming is mostly for speculative purposes. In summary, yesterday's market prices for all counts of coarse and fine yarn decreased by 60,000 to 100,000 compared with the previous day. Fangjian yesterday sold flowered cotton cloth at a flat price.

### Smooth Sales; Brazilian Cotton Opens for the First Time

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was flat, but trading was still smooth. Because the prices of gold and yarn were loose, and general holders of goods were aware of the tight money supply, they made slight concessions. Fangjian Company purchased a large quantity of special concentrates, totaling 1,300 to 1,400 pieces, all of which were fine-staple raw materials. Brazilian cotton has opened for the first time, and the price was softer than the previous day, decreasing by about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Silk Continues to Weaken

Yesterday, the silk market continued to weaken, people's minds were weak, and the market was quiet. The early opening price of 120-count Tianqiao rayon spot was 1.26 million, and then it decreased to 2.2 million. Semi-gloss was in high demand, higher than gloss, with an opening price of 2.3 million. Factory silk was slightly weaker, decreasing by 50,000 yuan. Silk fabrics were in a slump, the price of Meya bedspreads was 110,000 yuan lower than the previous day, and the highest price of Dacheng Gebi crepe was 4,360 yuan, and the final price was 4,100 yuan, 460 yuan lower than the previous day.

### Rice Market Gradually Stabilizes; Soybean Oil Sources Very Abundant

Yesterday, the rice market opened slightly tight in the morning, but digestion was average. The price softened again at noon, with no strength to rise. As a result, the market still tended to stabilize and will enter a winding pattern. The oil market was still depressed with abundant sources from Qingdao, and prices continued to decrease, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was flat, soybeans also had little fluctuation, high-priced goods were slightly outstanding, sesame seeds retreated by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, the raw kernels were firm, the iron skin kernels rose by 100 yuan, and the inland prices of flour were firm and strong. The Ningbo gang products had some inquiries and rebounded by 100 to 200 yuan. Also, according to the investigation by the Rice Market Management Committee, the amount of rice arriving in Shanghai last week was 50,492 shi (approximately 5,049 metric tons). The contents were 10,522 shi of white japonica rice, 12,596 shi of thin indica rice, 3,938 shi of foreign indica rice, 2,326 shi of du indica rice, 19,250 shi of wu indica rice, 925 shi of white yuan rice, and 935 shi of yin yuan rice. In addition, sporadic deliveries were not included, estimated to be around 60,000 shi.

### Tea Market Transactions Decrease

Recently, various tea producing firms in Shanghai, in view of the fact that overseas trade will soon be promoted, are busy reorganizing their businesses and collecting large batches of black and green tea samples to send abroad. As for the tea market situation in Shanghai, street shops and guest gangs still frequently inquire, but the sellers are eager to hold up prices and only sell a little, so the number of transactions is still small, but the market atmosphere is firm as before.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Because the market prices of industrial raw materials have risen too much in recent days, factories have temporarily stopped purchasing. Although holders of goods are trying to support prices, the trend is not as firm as before.

The sugar market is flat, but because the sellers are unwilling to sell, sparse transactions, the price of Xinghua white sugar is more chaotic, from 65,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan. The key lies in whether the tax bill number matches. If it matches, customer sales can move and some people will buy. Otherwise, sales in this street will be stagnant and no one will ask about it. The sugar auctioned by the Enemy Property Administration and the Public Association was not held yesterday because the procedures were not completed.

The early opening price of cotton cloth was 2,000 to 3,000 yuan higher than the afternoon off-market price yesterday, but the trend weakened due to the price of gold being reported lower. As a result, it was similar to yesterday's market, with very few transactions.

Reports of disposal of assets by the German Defu Foreign Firm will increase again. Although other foreign merchants' dye firms have orders, they are unable to confirm the deadline due to shipping vessel relations, so the firms' prices are also tight.

Cotton textiles' prices have fallen due to sluggish customer sales, and the industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude.

Guben scissors soap sales are sluggish and have fallen slightly, while Huang Xiangmao and Guanghua sales are very smooth and prices are brisk. Price drops are quite severe, and the bid price of foreign candles is similar to yesterday.

The early opening of cigarettes strengthened people's confidence, and the sales were very smooth. Apart from the stability of the Baiwanjin and Da Gao brands of Chinese merchants, the prices of all others rose uniformly.
