### Three Prominent Points in Ceasefire Order: Chairman Urgently Hopes for Comprehensive Discussion; Zhou Enlai Visits Marshall for Lengthy Talk Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] It is heard that Special Envoy Marshall and his staff, with superhuman energy, working tirelessly day and night, have drafted a new permanent ceasefire proposal. It is also heard that the informal three-person military council began its meeting at Special Envoy Marshall's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road on the afternoon of the 17th. If the talks result in a convergence of opinions between the two sides, a formal meeting may be announced in a timely manner. Ceasefire talks are rapidly progressing towards the door of peace amidst urgent and complex matters. The three days of the 18th, 19th, and 20th will be a crucial juncture for determining the fate of China and the fate of the Chinese Communist Party.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Today, there are only five days remaining until the ceasefire deadline. While the people of the country have varying opinions regarding the future development of the overall situation, with some being pessimistic and others optimistic, behind-the-scenes news suggests that the major issues currently awaiting resolution are not as complex and mysterious as rumored. It is heard that Chinese Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai had a lengthy talk with Special Envoy Marshall for two and a half hours on the morning of the 17th, during which they discussed issues related to the ceasefire in Northeast China (including the areas where the Communist army is stationed in the Northeast, local government, and traffic management) and the proportion of military reorganization in the Northeast. The detailed content has not been released.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Chairman Chiang, at the Central Memorial Week meeting, analyzed the current domestic political situation, stating that the government has consistently adopted a political solution to the Communist Party issue, but the Communist Party has been constantly delaying and undermining national peace and unity. The Chairman concluded by saying: "The ceasefire deadline in the Northeast is only four or five days away. I sincerely hope that concrete measures can be negotiated during this period so that the three prominent points in the ceasefire order can be fully resolved."

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] The key to the success or failure of peace negotiations seems to hinge on whether an agreement can be reached on how to determine the arbitration authority of General Marshall and the U.S. representatives of the Executive Headquarters and Executive Groups. The government has clearly stated that it will adhere to the original proposal for arbitration. Government representative General Xu Yongchang submitted a formal memorandum regarding the issue of arbitration authority to the Communist Party delegation yesterday. The Communist Party has not yet responded to this memorandum but will insist on the principle of consensus among all parties.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] According to Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, the principles and methods for restoring transportation have been largely determined and will be announced to the public in three days. It is heard that a concrete agreement is expected to be reached before the 20th. Colonel Hill plans to visit Zhou Enlai again tonight to make a decisive discussion on the restoration of transportation. Regarding the issues of dismantling fortifications, participating in management, and road protection police, the opinions of both sides are largely converging.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The railway bureaus in North China are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the transportation restoration negotiations. The Ministry of Communications has sent telegrams to the engineering personnel of the Pinghan, Longhai, and Jiaoji Railway Bureaus, urging them to actively prepare. As soon as a negotiation agreement is reached, they will be dispatched to various regions to actively work. Wu Shi'en, Deputy Director of the Longhai Railway, and the Director of the Zhangming Section Engineering Office of the Pinghan Railway are both in Nanjing, awaiting the final news.

### Navy Enters Changshan Islands; National Army's Breakthrough Troops Arrive at Jinan Suburbs

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] According to an announcement made here today, Central Navy warships, acting on the orders of the Northeast Security Headquarters, have occupied the Changshan Islands at the mouth of the Bohai Bay. The only sea route between the Communist army in Shandong and the Northeast has been cut off by the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 17th] From late night on the 16th to 7:00 a.m. on the 17th, gunshots were heard sporadically and frequently in the city. Dangerous elements lurking in the city had several clashes with the defending troops and military police.

[Another Telegram] The Communist army in Jiaodong, Jimo area outside Qingdao, within 34 hours after the ceasefire order took effect, gathered tens of thousands of troops and launched a full-scale attack on the garrison troops in Jiaoxian, Jimo, Chengyang, and Lancun areas. Within a few days, the aforementioned strongholds were successively captured by them. This kind of attack and seizure of territory by the Communist army, destructive behavior, caused innocent civilians to be brutally killed. The defending garrison troops, due to exhaustion of ammunition and food, perished together with the cities, and the number is countless. The details of the battle are as follows: (1) The Communist army in Lancun and Jiaoxian launched simultaneous attacks at 9:00 p.m. on the 8th. Their main force was Wu Kehua's unit. In addition, there were about 20,000 troops from Hao Pengju's unit, equipped with flat trajectory guns, small cannons, light and heavy machine guns, etc. Among them, the shooters were all Japanese. By 3:00 p.m. on the 9th, our defending troops ran out of ammunition and food. At the same time, about a thousand plainclothes armed Communists infiltrated the city and ambushed us, forming an internal and external attack. Our troops could not defend and broke through from the Lancun defense area. The casualties on both sides were very heavy. (2) The Communist army's Shandong Liberation Army's 4th Brigade, New 8th Regiment, New 9th Regiment, and Coastal Defense Militia Regiment, and the Nanhai District Independent Regiment besieged Jimo City. After eight days and nights of fierce fighting, the defending troops fought bravely, but due to excessive casualties, exhaustion of food, and no reinforcements, they broke through the south gate at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th and are now transferred to the Dazhou Village area. (3) More than 3,000 Communist troops launched a siege on Chengyang in several routes and were captured at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th. Our defending troops are continuing to resist in the Wangjiazhuang and Nuguo areas.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 16th] (1) On the night of the 14th, 13,000 Communist troops launched fierce attacks in four routes towards Shao'erzhuang, Xinglongzhuang, Dajiao, Qihe, Sangzidian, Licheng and other places outside Jinan. Our troops on all routes responded calmly and gave them head-on blows. Both sides are still in a stalemate in the same location. (2) The Communist army attacking Dangjiazhuang in Yancheng launched fierce and powerful attacks on us several times last night and this morning, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat. The enemy suffered many casualties and has retreated to its original position. (3) The bandits attacking Gaojiao have now completely turned to Jimo, Chengyang, Liuting, Xiazhuang, Huangbu and other places nearby, and their momentum is quite rampant. They are using Japanese as light and heavy weapons shooters, using fierce artillery fire to bombard our city and positions. The Xiguan of Jimo has been broken through by the Communist army and street fighting is underway. The battles in various places are extremely fierce. (4) The Communist army attacking Dawenkou has slightly reduced its offensive after being fiercely attacked by us for several days. Both sides are in a stalemate in the original positions. (5) Yidu is actively building fortifications on both sides of the Mi River and prohibits pedestrians in order to block all ferries across the Mi River. (6) Since the 10th, the Communist army has arrested our military, government, party, group, and religious personnel in Zhangdian. Most of them were killed. Soldiers who were captured were tied with iron wires and brutally beaten. It was extremely cruel. This afternoon, the Communist army again detained thousands of people in the direction of Yancheng, intending to launch a major attack on us.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] The defending troops who lost various places in Shandong Province in the past week have now arrived in the suburbs of Jinan. A part of the defending troops in Dezhou arrived near the Ji River. Commander Wang Jixiang's whereabouts are unknown. Commissioner Liu Shoucen is reportedly still in Dezhou, living with the task group. Zhangdian Commander Liu Zongyan was captured in Zhangqiu while leading his troops to break through. Commissioner Wang Chunyuan has safely arrived in Jinan. Zhoucun Commander Wang Yantian led the remnants of his troops to Jinan. Tai'an defending troops Commander Ning Chunlin and County Magistrate Liu Zhence also led their troops to the southwest suburbs of Jinan. Party groups from all walks of life here have been going to the suburbs to offer condolences for several days.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th] The Communist army besieging Wenxi concentrated artillery fire on the morning of the 15th and destroyed the southern city wall of Wenxi. They charged into the city and engaged in fierce street fighting with the defending troops. The defending troops, due to the disparity in numbers, withdrew to the northern wall at 4:00 p.m., and Wenxi City was lost.

[Another Telegram] Transportation sources: The Xiapanxi and Chengjiazhuang military stations on the Zhengtai Line were recovered by the National Army on the morning of the 17th. The Communist army is attacking Niangziguan, and the fighting between the two sides is very fierce.

### Brude Flies to Changchun Today; Preparing to Start Mediation Work in the Northeast; Zheng Jiemin Says Agreement Lies in Implementation

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Brude did not leave on the 17th and has been rescheduled to fly to Changchun on the 18th. An official in charge said to reporters that Brude's main mission to Changchun is still to complete the preparatory work for the Changchun Executive Subdivision, waiting to begin work immediately after the establishment of a comprehensive ceasefire plan in the Northeast. Currently, between now and the 22nd, the Executive Department can implement mediation based on the tripartite agreement of March 23rd, but because the period is too short, personnel cannot be deployed in time, and there is not much need in this short period. Therefore, the start of the Northeast Executive Subdivision's work still depends on the establishment of a peace charter. After Government Committee Member Zheng Jiemin of the Executive Department returned to Beiping last night, he went to the office today. Due to busy affairs, more than ten reporters from Beiping City who visited in the morning and afternoon were not received. He only told reporters in the afternoon that the signing of the new agreement is still based on the old agreement and requires efforts to implement it. Today is the tenth day of the ceasefire. In the Executive Department of the peace command, the heat is stifling. Both the government and the Communist Party are increasingly cautious in releasing news. Reporters are running into obstacles everywhere, complaining bitterly.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The Military Mediation Department has decided to send four more task groups to the Northeast to conduct mediation work.

### Zheng Dongguo Tells Reporters: No Serious Conflicts in the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo met with foreign reporters at his residence on the morning of the 17th. Zheng said: "In recent days, except for occasional attacks by a few Communist troops on the National Army's defense areas, there have been no serious military conflicts. The main force of the Communist army is currently concentrated in the Tonghua and Dunhua areas. The National Army is abiding by orders and remaining stationary. The Communist army is mobilizing frequently and often attacks our small strongholds with large forces. The purpose of the fifteen-day ceasefire is to resolve issues such as military reorganization and restoration of transportation. However, ten days have passed since the ceasefire, and these issues have not been resolved due to the Communist Party's delay." During the meeting, French reporter Rouel expressed his view that this ceasefire period provided the Communist army with an opportunity to reorganize. After the Battle of Siping Street, the main force of the Communist army was defeated, and the situation was quite critical.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] About 500 Communist troops arrived near Taipingchuan, 20 kilometers east of Meihe, and Xinhebao today. They also destroyed two bridges near Hainan Sili Zi Shuangmiao. The Communist army in Huinan is active near Kaoxiaotun.

### Pauley Inspects Fushun Mine; Preliminary Report on Investigation Completed; The Amount of Materials Taken Away by the Soviet Union is Astonishing

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] American Reparations Commissioner Pauley and his team, accompanied by Chairman Zhang Jia'ao, Special Commissioner Sun Yueqi, and Economic Affairs Committee Member Cheng Zongyang, departed from the Fushun Coal Mine by car at 8:30 a.m. on the 17th. They first went to the power plant for inspection. The scale of the factory is huge and the equipment is perfect. It is not only the first in China, but also rare in the Far East. The new power generators have all been transported away, and the old ones cannot be used. They then went to inspect the oil plant, the Xilutianku (coal mine), the liquefaction plant, and the light metal king factory. Among the factories, the power plant, the liquefaction plant, and the oil plant suffered the most losses and were the most severely damaged. The new machines were transported away, and the old ones were destroyed. A small part of the three factories have resumed work, but it is not easy to resume all work. The light metal factory suffered less damage, but there are no raw materials, and it has not yet resumed work. The entire inspection was completed at 12:00 noon. At 1:00 p.m., they boarded the car and left Fushun for Liaoyang, Anshan, and other places for inspection.

[Associated Press, Shenyang, 16th] According to a preliminary report submitted by members of the American Reparations Team to Reparations Commissioner Pauley yesterday, the amount of materials taken away from the Northeast by the Soviet occupation forces in the two months from September to November last year is almost unbelievable. The figures in the preliminary report of the Reparations Team are based on materials provided by officials of the Chinese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Japanese factory personnel, and personal investigations. According to Pauley, this survey shows that most of the materials were moved out between mid-September and November last year. However, what is hard to believe is that Soviet officials could transport such a large amount of materials in such a short period of time. According to the preliminary report, the equipment removed from the industry in the Shenyang area seems to be more than in other areas of the Northeast, because Shenyang is the most important city in the Northeast and a transportation hub. Pauley and most of his team members will go to Tokyo this week to meet with General MacArthur. However, the twelve team members led by engineer expert Hotard will remain in the Northeast for a month and meet with Pauley again after returning to Washington. A part of the team will go to Taiwan for inspection on Tuesday of this week, and after Pauley arrives there, they will accompany him to Paris.

[United Press, Shenyang, 17th] The investigation team led by American Reparations Commissioner Pauley reported to Pauley today that it has investigated 75 to 80 percent of the industry in the Northeast, but the extent of the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment in the Northeast and its impact on the Northeast's economy cannot be determined until the investigation is completed in one to three weeks. According to the survey results of one week, the demolition of the important factories of various industries and the important machines of various factories is tantamount to a fatal blow to the economy of the Northeast.

### Pei Zuoyi Discusses Current Financial Issues in Tianjin

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Pei Zuoyi, President of the Central Bank, went to Tianjin from Beiping on the 16th and will stay in Tianjin for four days before going to the Northeast depending on the situation. Li Junyao, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, and Wang Wenwei, Special Commissioner of the Northeast Region, who went to Tianjin with Pei, have left Tianjin for Shenyang today. It is reported that Pei's main mission in Tianjin is to inspect the current financial situation in Tianjin in order to prepare for improving the financial institutions in North China. Therefore, detailed investigations are being conducted in both Beiping and Tianjin.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 17th] After arriving in Tianjin, the President of the Central Bank discussed several current financial issues: (1) The rumor that we have raised the exchange rate of the US dollar is not true and will not change recently. (2) Although the official opening date of the foreign exchange market in Tianjin has not been announced, in fact, banks such as the Bank of China have already opened, but settlement is only made in Shanghai. (3) The exchange rate is the standard of a country's foreign trade value and cannot be divided into two exchange rates for import and export trade. Regarding encouraging exports, the government is trying to find ways, but there are too many difficulties in export trade, including (A) market interest rates are too high, (B) transportation is difficult, increasing export costs, and (C) domestic prices are high and wages are high. However, in terms of finance, the Central Bank has promised to find ways to provide exporters with low-interest funds and facilitate the turnover of funds from the interior to the port and sea port. (4) The so-called inflation at present is actually a psychological effect. If development and construction can be carried out, the currency may still feel insufficient. This requires everyone's efforts. (5) The government should support commercial banks so that they can gain a foothold. The Central Bank's financial inspection work is to implement government orders.

### Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense Announces Communist Army's Acts of Sabotage of the Agreement

(5) Damage to Transportation: Since the issuance of the order to cease conflict and restore transportation, the following transportation lines have been successively attacked and damaged by the Communist army: On the Longhai Railway line, the Taimiao, Baitabu, Bayiji, Xin'an, Ahu, Yunhe, and Daxujia stations, as well as the railway from Shangqiu to Minquan; on the Jinpu Railway, the Yanzhou, Dawenkou, Fengjiakou, Tangguantun, Hangu, Tangshan, and Machang stations, as well as the Linzi branch line and stations nearby; on the Jiaoji Railway, the Yidu, Gaomi Tabao, and Zhangling stations, as well as the Xin'an, Zhoucun, Mingshui, and Longshan lines; on the Pinghan Railway, the lines in Beiping, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang, and between Anyang, Tangyin, Guangshui, and Wushengguan; on the Daoqing Railway, the Jixian station; on the Tongpu Railway, between Taigu and Xuqing, between Houma and Wenxi, and between Jiexiu and Pingyao; on the Zhengtai Railway, the Yangquan station and between Pingding and Niangziguan; on the Baijin Railway, the railway near Qin County and the Zihong River railway bridge; on the Pingsui Railway, near the Guisui station and between Jining and Zhuozishan; on the Yeba-Chifeng Railway, the Tianyi station; on the Jincheng Railway, the Pingquan and Lingyuan stations and between Beizhen and Taipingfang; and on the Beining Railway, the Wanjiatun station and the entire western section of the Beining Railway line. All these were destroyed by the Communist army.

Obstruction of Transportation Restoration: Initially, during negotiations at the Beiping Executive Headquarters, the Communist Party used the pretext of strenuously vying for railway rights and management to delay the restoration of transportation. Subsequently, a plan was drafted by the American side and approved by the Military Tripartite Group, ordering both sides to assist in the restoration. However, the Communist army again used the pretext that the bunkers and city defense works protecting transportation must be completely removed to obstruct it. The following are examples of their obstruction: The Longhai Railway east of Xuzhou has been repaired, but the Communist army does not allow traffic. It was decided to first repair the Yuanshi to Gaoyi section within the Communist-occupied area of the Pinghan Railway, and track laying began on March 27th. However, on March 31st, the Communist army destroyed the repaired track again and transported the sleepers away. The section of the Jiaoji Railway west of Zhangdian has been obstructed and halted by the Communist army. The Tai'an to Liguo Station section and the Botou to Yancheng section of the Jinpu Railway have also been obstructed and halted by the Communist army. In addition, the Communist army has obstructed the Nankou section of the Pingsui Railway and the Gaomi section of the Jiaoji Railway, which have not yet started construction. Furthermore, the Communist army has detained and attacked government and American representatives of the mediation executive groups. The personnel of the executive groups in various places, who were originally representatives of all parties executing the order to cease conflict, had a significant mission. They had been agreed upon by the Communist side to have full freedom to inspect and act in any area or any conflict location. However, the Communist army deceived or deliberately made things difficult in many ways, making it impossible for the group personnel to perform their duties, or used the pretext of protection to prohibit independent action. Recently, government and American representatives have been detained and injured by the Communist army. For example, a group of seven government and American representatives of the Botou group were lured to Nanpi under the guise of consultation and detained by the Communist army on May 5th. At the same time, the Communist army launched an offensive in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. The group representatives were not released until the 12th. The Communist army representatives of the Chengde group repeatedly obstructed government and American representatives from going to various places for investigation. The American and government representatives were monitored and unable to work. The government and American representatives of the Chifeng group have been imprisoned in the guest house by the Communist army since May 5th and have not yet been freed. Although the tripartite committee in Beiping ordered them to go to various conflict areas for investigation, the Communist group members refused to accompany them. The American representative then requested to leave the city alone for investigation but was also rejected. The Communist Party representatives of the Chaoyang group consistently refused to participate for various reasons and, under the pretext of protection, prohibited free movement for the government and the other party representatives. Furthermore, on February 26th, the Communist army attacked the National Army in the Guozhangzi area, 80 li southeast of Pingquan. On March 1st, a group of several people including Colonel Routh, the American representative of the Chengde group, traveled from Pingquan to mediate. Unexpectedly, the car carrying the group personnel was machine-gunned by the Communist army for half an hour after entering the Communist defense zone through Xiaosigou, and the car was hit in many places. Lieutenant Colonel Hanriff, the American representative of the 26th group, was sniped at by the Communist army in Beipiao, suffering a back injury, and the interpreter was killed.

### "Third Party" Luo Longji: Glass Pants, Crooked Neck

[Our Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] People in Nanjing have gradually become acquainted with the "third parties" mentioned in the newspapers. Regarding Mr. Luo Longji, the "tail-end doctor" among the "third parties," some jokingly call him "glass pants" because everything inside is completely exposed, leaving no room to hide. Others call him "crooked neck," implying that the public is increasingly disappointed in gentlemen who are not upright and whose heads are biased. Because the current situation requires impartial figures like Zhang Junmai, who possess political morality and do not engage in opportunistic behavior, to enhance the voice of genuine third parties in order to shoulder the great responsibility of resolving difficulties.

### Commemoration of the Premier's Ordeal in Guangzhou Held Jointly with Memorial Week; Chairman Chiang Encourages Promoting Revolutionary Spirit

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The commemoration of the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou was held jointly with the Central Memorial Week at the National Government this morning, the 17th. After Chairman Chiang presided over the ceremony, he delivered a speech, encouraging all comrades to promote the revolutionary spirit, stating briefly: Today, we hold the 24th anniversary of the Father of the Nation's ordeal in Guangzhou. All comrades are well aware of the Father of the Nation's ordeal that year, so I need not elaborate. However, one point must be emphasized: the rapid development and great success of the National Revolution Movement in the 24 years from 1922 to the present are all due to the great inspiration of the Father of the Nation's ordeal in Guangzhou. The Father of the Nation's ordeal in Guangzhou was the most violent attack on the National Revolution Movement by the reactionaries. If Chen Jiongming's conspiracy had succeeded at that time, the future of the revolution would have been unimaginable. However, the Father of the Nation, based on the revolutionary spirit and his responsibility to the nation and the people, resolutely regarded himself as Wen Tianxiang, disregarding life and death, and led a small number of comrades in a fierce battle against the reactionaries, with nine deaths and one life. This spirit of fearlessness was the greatest reason for the rapid development of the National Revolution Movement later. As we recall the serious difficulties the Father of the Nation encountered that year, he was able to overcome the dangers and make the revolution grow stronger with each setback. Given the solid foundation and favorable environment of today's revolution, as long as we adhere to the Father of the Nation's Three Principles of the People and our responsibility to the nation and the people, without fearing difficulties and striving diligently, any difficulty can be overcome, and we hold unlimited optimism for the future of the nation and the people.

[Another Dispatch] After today's Memorial Week, President Chiang summoned Wang Bao’an, the newly appointed chairman of the Jiangsu Party Headquarters, and gave detailed instructions on promoting compulsory work in Jiangsu Province in the future.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] The Guangzhou community held a general assembly to commemorate the Premier's ordeal at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on the 17th.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] Today is the memorial day for revolutionary martyrs in Taiwan. The Taiwan Political Construction Promotion Association held a ceremony this morning at the First Theater to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves to resist foreign rule for the past fifty years and gave lectures on revolutionary history.

### Restoration of Mongolian Banners in Progress; Troops from Suiyuan and Ningxia Provinces Have Withdrawn; Democratic System Implemented in Jungar Banner

[Our Beiping, 17th Dispatch] The restoration of Mongolian banners in Suiyuan Province is gradually progressing. (1) The troops from Suiyuan and Ningxia provinces stationed in the Ikh Juu League to assist the Mongolian banners in the War of Resistance have withdrawn as their mission has been completed. The security of the Ikh Juu League is now entirely maintained by the Mongolian banner security teams. Recently, the security teams of various banners have been reorganized, with each banner's security team stipulated to have 300 members. (2) The Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council, which was established in the Jassak Banner of the Ikh Juu League during the War of Resistance, has seen its key members abandon Suiyuan for Baotou. Therefore, there is a proposal to relocate the Jassak Banner Mongolian Political Council to Baotou to conduct business. However, as the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee had a motion to restore the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee, if that motion is implemented, the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council can be abolished. Therefore, the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council remains in a wait-and-see state. (3) Prince A of the Fuxing Banner, who was captured by the enemy, and Prince Kang of the Darat Banner, who remained in the rear during the War of Resistance, have both returned to their banners and resumed their duties. Queen Qi Junfeng (Queen of the West Gong Banner), Ba Yunying (Queen of the East Gong Banner), and Erenhang Dalai Maoming (Queen of the An Banner), who were exiled to Shanba during the War of Resistance, have all returned to their banners victoriously and resumed their duties after the enemy surrendered. (4) After the dictator of the Jungar Banner in the Ikh Juu League, Qi Wenying, was assassinated on his way to Jassak on March 17th of the lunar calendar, the Jungar Banner was leaderless. Chief Fu ordered Mongolian and Han Chinese people in the banner to organize an autonomous committee to govern the banner affairs. Regarding the Mongolians in the Yike Chao League, after the dictator of the Ordos Banner, Zhang Wenxuan, was assassinated on New Year's Day, the Suiyuan Mongolian Guidance Chief's Office planned to order Yangseng Zhabu and Qi Encheng to organize a joint regime.

### Over a Thousand of Our Technical and Industrial Personnel Prepare to Return Home; Excellent Performance in Internships in the United States

[United Press, Washington, 16th] The United States has decided to assist China in becoming self-reliant militarily and economically, thereby becoming a guarantee of peace in the Far East and the security of the United States. This determination will be greatly strengthened in the coming months. In the past year, approximately 1,000 Chinese technical personnel and industrial and commercial professionals have interned in the United States and are now preparing to return home successively. They will use the methods they have learned with the help of the government and the industrial and commercial sectors in the United States to assist their motherland in solving urgent problems. These personnel were invited by the US government and factories and sent by the Chinese government to intern in the United States. There are both men and women, from bookkeepers to deputy directors of railway bureaus. They have been distributed throughout the country for internships. The US government is now preparing several special trains to transport them to San Francisco in batches, where they will board American ships to return home. Judging from the handling of this matter by the Chinese and American governments, this experiment can be considered a complete success. Most of the interns are graduates of domestic universities, and some have obtained degrees from American universities. They have studied what they are good at, and the internship locations are all well-known American factories and commercial institutions. According to the employing authorities, these interns are living up to expectations, and the plan is a complete success. Another group of people advocates adopting a reciprocal approach, as the United States also needs people who are familiar with China and the Chinese people in order to do business with them.

Editorial

### The Misfortune of National Goods Factories

The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories Association held its first meeting since the victory of the War of Resistance yesterday. They decided to launch a "Love National Goods Movement." "Love National Goods" is an old tune from twenty years ago, but it is disheartening that it has to be replayed today, and even needs to be emphasized more strongly! Foreign goods flood the market, and almost everything one sees is "American-style equipment." National industries are on their last breath, and the closure of entire factories is already in sight. At this time, the significance of the national goods movement is even more important. If national goods have no way out, Chinese industry will not only be in difficulty, but will simply be driven to a dead end!

This newspaper has repeatedly pointed out the crisis facing China's industrial future in its editorials, but what is the use of loud appeals when they cannot even budge the slightest bit the people in charge of economic policy? We dare to say something painful: a hundred or a thousand appeals from national goods factory entrepreneurs will rarely reach the ears of the relevant authorities in the current situation where "bureaucratic capital" and "comprador policies" complement each other. Today, the plans of some high-ranking officials are just to import more cheap foreign goods, collect more taxes, earn more money, print more banknotes, and auction off more "extra" property. Why would they care about the disappearance of national goods, the decline of industry, or the collapse of the economy?

National industrialists, with the fire burning their eyebrows, urgently call for "Loving National Goods," thinking that if everyone uses national goods out of conscience, the industrial crisis can be reversed. In fact, this is too simplistic. Why has Chinese industry ended up in this situation today? The reasons are certainly very complex, but also very obvious. For example: (1) The domestic political situation is unstable and insecure, transportation has not yet recovered, freight is not smooth, and raw materials are expensive, directly increasing production costs; (2) The government has no overall plan to stabilize prices, resulting in small increases and small declines, endlessly cycling. The cost of living continues to rise, and wages also increase accordingly. Factories can hardly bear just the expense of paying salaries; (3) Labor disputes emerge endlessly. In addition to demanding improved treatment, workers strike at the slightest provocation, even resorting to mass violence, destroying property, and beating people. Discipline is abandoned, and efficiency is low, giving factory owners the feeling that "it is difficult to maintain operations and impossible to shut down"; (4) Foreign exchange is low, foreign goods are cheap, foreign goods taxes are light, and national goods taxes are heavy. Domestically produced finished products cannot compete with foreign goods. Coupled with the people's psychology of loving foreign goods, national goods have no room to stand. ... Looking at these points, we can see that prescribing the right medicine is no longer just about promoting national goods today.

The authorities in power are certainly well aware of the above reasons; especially the newly appointed Minister and Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, most of whom come from the private sector and may have even run their own businesses or worked as accountants for a long time. How could they not know the pain and the actual crisis suffered by the Chinese industrial sector? It is said that Minister Wang Yunwu plans to convene a national economic conference at the end of this month to find a way out for Chinese industry. Hopefully it will not just be a meeting without discussion, discussion without resolution, or resolution without implementation, merely wasting tens of thousands of millions of national currency. Of course, we certainly cannot expect the government to have a panacea for saving industry from misfortune, but in any case, the most practical way is to encourage exports without haggling over the amount of tariff revenue. This would certainly plug the huge loopholes to some extent. Only by first blocking this foreign goods craze that is formed by a steady stream can China's fragile industry have hope of recovery.

Having said that, the country belongs to the people, and reducing the use of foreign goods cannot rely entirely on the government's efforts. If everyone is of one mind and works together, perhaps the raging tide of China's collapsing industry can be reversed. Therefore, the "Love National Goods Movement" should ultimately be practiced by everyone. In the past hundred years, our country has repeatedly suffered from foreign aggression, and its international status has plummeted. People in major cities often come into contact with foreigners, and unconsciously develop a psychology of admiring foreign goods and fawning over foreigners. The nation's self-esteem and self-confidence have almost disappeared. Especially in Shanghai, fashionable people prefer to be completely "Westernized," equipped with "foreign-style equipment," wishing they themselves could become "blue-eyed and blond-haired." Such a phenomenon was not surprising before the War of Resistance. But after the victory, China's international status should be different from the past. In terms of economy, we should also strive to revitalize industry and produce national goods, so that we can keep pace with the four major powers. The psychology of loving foreign goods should be changed. However, there is no plan for industrial recovery, and the takeover and bidding process has been going on until now. Not only is it impossible to lay the foundation for national industry, but existing factories may also be reduced to a pile of scrap metal. In addition, the government's financial and foreign exchange policies seem to only encourage the business community to order machinery from foreign countries, but instead end up being rejected. This is a mistake on the part of the government, and on the part of the people, they are restoring their bad habit of being fond of foreign goods. Who is doing this, and who is causing it? If everyone does not wake up today, and the government and the people do not quickly repent of their past mistakes, it will be too late to regret!

Before the case could be processed, Xinghua fell to the enemy. The bandit escaped from prison and contacted the Japanese invaders, organizing and expanding a team to serve as the head of the 87th Regiment of the 22nd Puppet Division and other positions. After the victory, the traitor immediately went to the Nanjing and Shanghai area to engage in activities. He was appointed as the captain of the county security brigade by Bu Zhenhai, the magistrate of Xinghua County (currently stationed in Taizhou). However, this was opposed by the gentry of the county.

[United Press Paris, 17th] The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union began today to study the preliminary reports submitted by the representatives of the foreign ministers of various countries. They are paying attention to several major issues on which no agreement has yet been reached. It is reported that the report contains an outline of the draft Italian treaty, but there are several major gaps that need to be filled, mainly who will the Adriatic port of Trieste ultimately belong to, how will Italian colonies and reparations be distributed, etc. The four foreign ministers agreed yesterday to first study the Italian issue. According to sources, the Romanian treaty is also being drafted in outline and is ready to be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The treaty includes recognition of the agreement concluded between the two countries of Romania at the beginning of the war to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union.

[Reuters Paris, 17th] The U.S.-proposed draft treaty with Austria is divided into sixteen main parts. Once adopted, it will restore Austria's independence, abolish the Allied governments' control, and the Allies will guarantee the country's independence and integrity, and recommend the country as a candidate for membership in the United Nations.

### The Soviet Side Believes That All Issues Are Not Absolutely Unresolvable and Supports the Demands of the Southern Country for the Port of Trieste

[Reuters Moscow, 16th] The Soviet News Agency's telegram from Paris stated that the United States and Britain should immediately recognize Yugoslavia's legitimate demands for the port of Trieste at the Paris Conference in response to the Soviet Union's previous concessions. It is recalled that at the last Paris Conference, the Soviet representative made several proposals to facilitate an agreement on the disposal of Italian colonies and the issue of Italian reparations. Therefore, public opinion generally feels that the United States and Britain should show a spirit of understanding this time, especially recognizing the legitimate demands of the Allied country Yugoslavia on the Italian southern border issue and the port of Trieste. People in Allied countries generally feel that the issues facing the Four Powers Conference are not absolutely unresolvable, but only some newspapers in Britain, the United States, and France are extremely pessimistic about the Paris Conference.

Truman is even willing to leave the plane in the Soviet Union so that Soviet pilots can drive it back and forth between the Soviet Union and the United States.

### Allied Control Committee for Japan Passes Plan to Reorganize Japanese Rural Areas. Soviet Suggestion to Confiscate Japanese Private Land Opposed Unanimously by Chinese, American and British Representatives.

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] Today, the Chinese, British and Soviet representatives of the United Nations Control Committee for Japan, passed a two-year plan to reorganize Japanese rural areas.

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] At today's meeting of the Allied Control Committee, the Chinese and British representatives echoed the views of the United States and opposed the Soviet proposal. The Soviet Union previously proposed to confiscate the larger estates in Japan, only giving half the value or even nothing, and then distributing this land to the farmers, as the basis for the previously proposed Japanese land reform movement.

After the meeting began, the U.S. representative, Acheson, read a prepared statement, criticizing the Soviet proposal of May 29. Acheson briefly stated the U.S. position: "Any proposal to change the ownership of land or other assets without paying the value is inconsistent with the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration. This proposal is also contrary to the principle of encouraging and strengthening democratic tendencies within Japan, because they are contrary to the principles of democracy." Acheson emphasized that MacArthur is determined to distribute land according to the following principles, namely that the tillers own their land, and to eliminate all feudal ruling forces of the landlords.

After Acheson's statement was read, the Chinese representative said that he agreed with the British amendment, that is, the maximum amount of land owned by owner-farmers on the four countries, Honshu, and Kyushu islands should not exceed seven and a half mu, and the highest amount in Hokkaido's more barren areas should not exceed twenty-five mu.

The Soviet delegation then made a new proposal, but the proposal still advocated confiscating land from several classes without paying the value. Acheson immediately expressed his opposition, and the Chinese and British representatives also supported Acheson's position.

The suggestion made by the meeting to Master Mai will be to divide large tracts of land into smaller plots, and then sell them to farmers by way of loans.

### De Gaulle Re-Enters the Political Arena Proposing a Bicameral Parliamentary System Granting Extensive Administrative Powers to the President Completely Opposite to the Communist Party's Claims.

[Agence France-Presse France Bei, 16th] Today is the second anniversary of General de Gaulle's return to his homeland. A celebration ceremony was held here. General de Gaulle, wearing a brown brigadier general's uniform, participated in the grand ceremony, and the people cheered for him. After laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, he went to erect a stone monument at the place where he returned to his homeland two years ago to commemorate the liberation of Bayeux. The inscription reads: On June 14, 1944, the residents of Bayeux regained their freedom, and General de Gaulle, the liberator of the nation, gave his first speech in this free place.

[United Press Paris, 16th] With the support of the Popular Republican Party, De Gaulle re-entered the political arena, and the Communist Party issued a statement today opposing any government led by the moderate Popular Republican Party. De Gaulle's political views were expressed at the celebration of the second anniversary of his return to his homeland in Bayeux in 1944, breaking his six-month political silence. De Gaulle advocated granting broad administrative powers to a non-partisan head of state; making him the President of France, establishing a bicameral system and a strong executive branch to defend democracy. It is said that the threat of dictatorship still exists in France, and the new constituent assembly should strictly separate the three powers of executive, legislative, and judicial. De Gaulle also mentioned his resignation as interim president in January of this year, saying that this move was to avoid being involved in political disputes and giving people the opportunity to manipulate legislation. De Gaulle's remarks have a significant political impact, and the constitution he proposed is almost the same as what the Popular Republican Party advocates, and completely opposite to the Communist Party. The Communist Party advocates a one-house parliament and an executive branch with no real power.

The Communist Party Proposes to Organize a Three-Party Coalition Government

### George Bernard Shaw Wishes to Be a Ceylonese, Says Ceylonese are the Direct Descendants of the Creator, Close Relations Between Britain and India Still a Distant Prospect

[Reuters, London, 16th] The famous journalist Sabra interviewed George Bernard Shaw and asked if India's attainment of freedom would bring British-Indian cultural relations closer. Shaw said that the prospect of the two nations establishing closer relations is still very distant. The other questions and answers are recorded by Reuters as follows:

Q: "Leader Magazine" recently published an article by a Ceylonese writer, which stated: "Mr. George Bernard Shaw once said that if he were an Irishman, he would obtain a passport to Ceylon." Please explain why you chose Ceylon? A: I like the place and people of Ceylon; it was a profound first impression. Westerners generally recognize that the Ceylonese are the direct descendants of the Creator, which is the opposite of the mass-produced Western mobs.

Q: "Leader Magazine" also stated, "When the play "The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles" was performed in Colombo by Ceylonese actors, it was more popular than any masterpiece performed in Dublin. Why?" A: The audience's support is a fact that cannot be understood. Please ask the author of the article.

National Conflicts Seek Compromise

Q: The Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority in Ceylon often have conflicts. What is the solution? A: They must seek their own compromise, as the Scots, English, and Russians have done. Or like the compromise between the Catholic and Protestant in Ireland. Otherwise, they should fight each other to the point of elimination, which is impossible.

Q: In Hesketh Pearson's book "George Bernard Shaw", you said that the former Indian guru Jiddu Krishnamurti was the most handsome person you have ever seen. Besides his good looks, what else did he say? A: His refusal to become the "Star of the East" was an extraordinarily clever move. Those who are highly respected do not need any further public praise.

Indian Religions Need Reform

Q: Books such as Huxley's "Time Must Have a Stop" and Maugham's "The Razor's Edge" contain Indian religious ideas. Do you think this is a good phenomenon in British literature? A: This is an excellent phenomenon. It allows British writers to use their minds instead of just shouting slogans. However, Indian religions also need improvement. For example, temple decorations are too simplistic.

Q: What are your thoughts on modern British poetry? A: I have never read modern poetry, mainly because I am too old. Among poets, after William Morris, I only know John Masefield.

Q: After India becomes free, can British-Indian culture have closer relations? Is this relationship beneficial to the British nation? A: It is still very distant for these two nations to establish closer relations. I think you want me to give a detailed speech. You must hope so, no doubt. Goodbye.

### Formation of Interim Government in India Still Faces Twists and Turns, Congress Party Opposes the Principle of Equality, Final Attitude to Be Decided Tomorrow

[This Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: It is reported that Nehru has accepted the invitation from the Indian Governor-General and the British Cabinet delegation to participate in the interim government.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] After the Governor-General of India announced that negotiations between the two major political parties on forming an interim government had broken down, he invited fourteen people to serve in the government today, including five members of the Congress Party, five members of the Muslim League, one chairman of the All-India Depressed Classes League, and representatives of other minority groups. The Governor-General's move is in accordance with the principle of equal numbers of both major parties, but the Congress Party may demand an additional representative from a minority group. The Governor-General stated that if his suggestion is accepted, the new people's government can be expected to be established around June 26. If rejected, he may invite representatives of all factions that have accepted the British proposal for Indian independence to form a government for trial.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] The Congress Party may make a final decision on the British proposal to establish an interim government by Wednesday. Gandhi said that the proposal is half light and half darkness. The opinions of the Congress Party on the proposal are roughly equal between those who oppose it and those who support it. The Muslim League is satisfied because it has equal representation for each Indian district. The interim government is composed of fourteen people, which is not much different from the fifteen people demanded by the Congress Party, and the increase in minority representation is also in accordance with the Congress Party's request. Of the fifteen people on the list submitted by the Congress Party, twelve seem to have been accepted by the Governor-General of India and the British Cabinet delegation.

Political Stalemate Expected to Break

[United Press, New Delhi, 16th] The hope of avoiding civil war in India may be strengthened tonight. Although powerful figures in the Congress Party Executive Committee opposed the British proposal, the party chairman Acharya Kripalani and the spiritual leader of the Indian people, Gandhi, have warned against rejecting the British proposal. Kripalani believes that in view of the food panic and economic crisis that India is about to face, we must be cautious and have a practical outlook.

### Atomic Bomb Explosion Will Not Cause Earthquakes, U.S. Scientists Explain Reasons

[United Press, U.S. News Ship Appalachian, 17th] Wisconsin scientist Dr. Nolask said in a broadcast today: Stralov said that testing the power of atomic bombs on warships may cause the earth's crust to split, causing earthquakes, and all participants in the test will be destroyed. In fact, there is no such danger. The possibility of danger in the Bikini test is less than the chance of a meteorite one mile in diameter falling on the roof of the Empire State Building. The explosion of an atomic bomb is completely different from the nature of an earthquake. Such earthquakes as Stralov said have occurred hundreds of thousands of times on the Pacific seabed, but none of them has caused such a tragic scene as Stralov said, that is, seawater flowing into the earth's core, causing a huge explosion. In addition, the Bikini atoll is also the area in the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are least likely to occur. The country most prone to earthquakes in the world is Japan, but Japan was bombed by atomic bombs twice and did not cause earthquakes. According to Dr. Talask's broadcast, the purpose is to reduce the fear of the participants and their families caused by Stralov's remarks.

### Atomic Energy Difficult to Apply to Airplanes

[U.S. News Agency, San Francisco, 16th] Dr. Alvarez, a physicist at the University of California who helped invent the atomic bomb, said in a speech to the Pacific Coast Electric Association on June 14 that due to the weight of the lead walls required to prevent radiation, any type of aircraft before the moon cannot use atomic energy. He also said that before atomic energy can be used for commercial purposes, two major difficulties must be overcome, namely radiation and corrosion.

### Far East International Tribunal Reads Out Historical Records of Japanese War Criminals, 26 Defendants Anxious

Wei Tao-ming and Qin De-chun Attended the Hearing Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Far East International Tribunal Prosecutor's Office presented detailed records of the past history of the 26 major Japanese war criminals this morning to determine each criminal's responsibility for launching the war of aggression. The criminals were anxious in court. The documents on each defendant's desk were piled up like mountains. The defendants were busy taking notes when the prosecutors read out the historical records of each individual. The most calm among them was Iwane Matsui, who was charged with being responsible for the "Nanjing Massacre." Matsui looked quite thin and wore glasses. When his past historical records were read out in court, he sat in the defendant's box calmly, looked up at the ceiling, or stroked his beard and turned to look at the prosecutor. As for Osami Nagano, when he heard his name read out in his earphones, he immediately took out a pencil and began to take notes, not stopping until the prosecutor read out the name of Rear Admiral Oka Takazumi, the former director of the Navy Affairs Bureau. When the prosecutor read out Oka's past historical records, he closed his eyes and sat upright, frowning from time to time, indicating that he had vaguely forgotten the past. Before the prosecutor read out the record of Hiroshi Oshima, the former ambassador to Germany, his defense lawyer objected to this evidence, saying that the Japanese version of this record was only part of the documents submitted, and requested the entire translation. Court President Webb rejected this, saying that this would make Oshima's trial far more cumbersome than any trial in the world. When the court opened this morning, American defense lawyer McTeague applied to the court to add more defense personnel. He said that the administrative staff on the defense side had been reduced, and the court will decide on this matter later. Wei Tao-ming, our ambassador to the United States, stopped in Tokyo on his way back to China. He attended the hearing today with Qin De-chun, our Deputy Minister of National Defense.

### Use Propaganda and Education Institutions to Promote and Instill Militaristic Ideas

The court session was opened by telegram at 1:30 p.m. Prosecutor Helvey continued to explain the history of the defendants, followed by Prosecutor Hammack's initial presentation on Attachment A of the indictment, "Reorganization of Japanese Politics and Others into a Wartime System." It was pointed out that Japanese leaders used all propaganda agencies and educational institutions to promote militarism, making the Japanese people believe that Manchuria was Japan's lifeline and that it was Japan's mission to extend to mainland China. In order to foster the principle of nationalism among school students, defendant Marquis Kido completely revised the education system in 1937, which was later implemented by General Araki, to instill in young people a desire for war and a cruel hatred of the enemy through training and coercion. In addition, in 1939, organized and planned propaganda began, using newspapers, magazines, general publications, movies, and radio for extensive publicity. Those who opposed this propaganda were suppressed by all means. The police system played a great role in promoting this conspiracy. The conspiracy of the defendants is evidenced by the following events:

(1) Restricting the Minister of the Army and Navy to be served by active-duty generals and lieutenant generals, Imperial Edict of 1936. (2) The Tanaka Cabinet resigned in 1929 following the assassination of Zhang Zuolin. (3) The failure of General Ugaki to form a cabinet in 1937. (4) The resignation of the Yonai Cabinet in 1937. (5) The resignation of the Third Konoe Cabinet in 1941. (6) The assassination attempt on Prime Minister Hamaguchi in 1930. (7) The March Incident and October Incident in 1931. (8) The assassination of Finance Minister Inoue and Baron Dan in 1932. (9) The May 15 Incident. (10) The February 26 Incident. (11) The birth of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in 1940. (To be changed to Zaoshe)

Lieutenant Colonel Nugent Testifies in Court

The first witness for the prosecution, U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Nugent, testified in court. Lieutenant Colonel Nugent taught in Japan before the war and is now the Education Director of MacArthur's Headquarters. According to his testimony, those who planned the war in Japan used schools to instill fanatical beliefs in young people, falsely claiming that Japan had a "sacred mission" to rule East Asia and would eventually realize "Hakkō ichiu" to control the world. Japanese schools not only used teaching materials that were inclined towards military goals, but also forced students to engage in field exercises, street fighting research, bayonet practice, and machine gun practice. This kind of training made students suffer from extreme nationalism and militarism, so that students loved the country as if they were drunk and knew only obedience. Tojo sat blankly during the previous interrogations, seemingly unmoved, but today he leaned forward, staring at the witness, looking quite concerned. (United Press above)

### Two-Pronged Approach: Judicial and Military Organs Simultaneously Investigate Grain Loan Case; Three Grain Officials Detained Successively; Five Rice Merchants Released on Bail Except for Shao Jigaoy Kept in Detention

[Our Own Dispatch] Since Chairman Chiang personally issued a handwritten order and selected senior officials to come to Shanghai for thorough investigation, progress has been made in the grain loan case. As of yesterday, the entire case has reached its climax. In the morning, the District Court Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation hearing, summoning four suspected grain officials and eight related grain loan rice merchants. Among the four grain officials, except for Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of Shanghai Grain Administration, who has not returned from studying in the United States, and Wang Daren, Acting Director of the Grain Administration, who remained in the Garrison Headquarters and did not appear in court, Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Department, and Ren Xingyai, Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section of the Grain Administration, appeared in court in a timely manner. After the interrogation, Ren Xingyai, along with rice merchant Shao Jigaoy, was detained by the District Prosecutor's Office. Li Chongnian was released on bail after providing three million yuan in cash and a shop guarantee, subject to being summoned at any time. Escorted by bailiffs to find a guarantor, he was about to complete the procedures at around 5 p.m. yesterday when the military authorities arrested Li in a lightning manner. At around 7 p.m., he was transferred to the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters. Although Ren Xingyai is currently temporarily detained at the District Prosecutor's Office, it is reported that when necessary, some responsible persons of rice merchants related to grain loans will be summoned. The proceedings of the investigation hearings held yesterday by the District Prosecutor's Office and the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters are described separately below:

District Prosecutor's Office

Around 9 a.m. yesterday, the summoned grain merchants successively reported to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. The first to arrive were Xu Taiyuan, owner of Zhifeng Miscellaneous Grain Store, and Wan Molin, owner of Wanchangxing Rice Store and manager of Wanchang Rice Store, and Feng Genghua, manager of Xiechangtai Rice Store, among others. Around 10 a.m., Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Department of the Ministry of Food (wearing a dark blue Zhongshan suit), also arrived. Shortly after, Ren Xingyai, Chief of the Regulation Section (wearing a beige Zhongshan suit) arrived, carrying a bag of cookies. As he did not have a summons, he was stopped by bailiffs outside the gate of the District Prosecutor's Office. Only after the summons was verified at the summons office was he allowed to enter. The strictness of the gate control at that time can be seen from this. At exactly 11 a.m., all eleven witnesses and defendants were led into the courtroom by bailiffs. Prosecutor Wu Qihua began the investigation. The first to be summoned was Li Chongnian, followed by Ren Xingyai, and then Xing Songwen and Wan Molin, among others. The interrogation was completed at 1:30 p.m. The court ordered the detention of Ren Xingyai and Shao Jigaoy (manager of Fuhang Bank) (detained at the Masnan Road Detention Center). Li Chongnian was released on bail after providing three million yuan in cash and a shop guarantee. Wan Molin and Xing Zhigang (manager of Chenfeng Company) were each released on bail after providing ten million yuan in cash and a shop guarantee. Xu Taiyuan, Xing Songwen (manager of Jiangbei Company), Gu Yisheng (owner of Hushuntai Rice Store), and Zhu Shilu (owner of Xiechangtai Rice Store) were each released on bail after providing five million yuan in cash and a shop guarantee. Only Yang Runhui, the current manager of Wanchangxin Rice Store, and Feng Genghua were not required to post bail and were allowed to return home freely. After Ren and Shao were detained, they spoke with reporters. According to Ren, this matter was truly unjust to him and was completely influenced by the blind attacks of certain newspapers. If he had truly engaged in bribery and corruption, society could judge and execute him. During yesterday's interrogation, nine of the witnesses testified that they did not know Ren. Therefore, Ren Xingyai sighed to reporters: "I have an elderly mother in Nanjing, and my wife in Shanghai has three children. Because of this case, our lives will become problematic. Therefore, after I am released from prison, I will tell my children and grandchildren never to become officials again!" It is said that on the 22nd of this month, Section Chief Pan sent someone to instruct him to go to Beijing to "avoid the limelight." By the 24th, rumors were rife in the rice market that he had been arrested and escorted to Nanjing, but in fact, he was ordered to go to Beijing only on the 25th. While in Beijing, he heard that the District Court was going to summon him, so he rushed back to Shanghai, but the summons had already been sent to Nanjing, so he had not received it. He also said that Wang Daren was clearly arrested in his office by the Garrison Headquarters on the afternoon of the 14th upon the order of Chairman Chiang, but a certain newspaper claimed that he was arrested in a brothel. Ren is a native of Yixing, 33 years old, and lives at 53 Duolun Road. He appeared quite anxious after being detained. The other detainee, Shao Jigaoy, is a native of Shanghai, 31 years old, and lives at 63 Taoyuan Road. He was wearing a blue long gown with white thin stripes and looked very refined. He was quite patient in the detention center.

According to a prosecutor at the District Prosecutor's Office, because the current grain loan corruption case has a great impact on people's livelihood and society, and the Chairman has also issued a handwritten order to handle it strictly, if the office investigates and obtains conclusive evidence that fits the provisions of special laws, it will prosecute according to the special laws or try it by military law, and punish severely (by shooting!) to satisfy the people's wishes.

Garrison Headquarters

On the other hand, the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters also interrogated Wang Daren all day yesterday and brought Wu Rongsheng, who was in custody, and the person in charge of the Changjiang Company to court for cross-examination. In the evening, it summoned fourteen rice merchants who had received grain loans. To clarify the division of authority of the authorities in handling the case, the reporter specially visited Zeng Zhaoyi, Director of the Military Law Office, yesterday. Zeng did not give a definite statement on this point, only saying that judging from the nature of the case, it could be tried by military law (Zeng also showed the military law provisions on the spot), and the most evidence and documents have been collected by this office, so the case may be transferred to military law for trial in the short term. However, because the case involves too many people, it is difficult to publish the interrogation situation at present. It is expected that the truth will come out in about ten days.

### Zhang Daomin of the Grain Department's Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office Comes to Preside

The Shanghai Grain Administration of the Ministry of Food has been abolished and reorganized into the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office. Yang Xizhi was originally appointed as the director, and Wang Daren as the deputy director. Now, because Yang and Wang are involved in the grain loan corruption case, one has been arrested and the other is still in the United States. Therefore, the Ministry of Food has yesterday sent Zhang Daomin, a counselor, to Shanghai to preside over the Storage and Transportation Office, and may succeed to the position of director of the Storage and Transportation Office.

### First Day of General Mobilization for Epidemic Prevention: Separate Actions to Launch Work; Comprehensive Promotion of Epidemic Prevention; Mayor Wu Broadcasts a Speech: We Must Not Be Afraid, Just Do It; Fear Is Useless, Action Is Effective

It was the first day of the joint general mobilization for epidemic prevention. Epidemic prevention personnel from the Health Bureau and other departments were dispatched separately to launch work. A summary is as follows: (1) The National Shanghai Medical College originally planned to send 80 professors and students yesterday to participate in immunization injections, but due to student exams, it temporarily changed to sending 30 teachers and students from the First Hospital Nursing School of the Chinese Red Cross Society, plus the Eighth Epidemic Prevention Team, to carry out injections. (2) Sixteen teachers and students from the Peiping Union Nursing School were assigned to immunization injections. (3) The above two items, together with more than 80 staff members drawn from the Health Bureau, members of the Epidemic Prevention Team, and doctors and nurses drawn from various health centers and municipal hospitals, totaled approximately 250 people, divided into 50 small teams, and went to more than 20 streets such as Suzhou Creek and Shajing Port, the eight city gates of the district and county, various parks, the four major company entertainment venues, and major factory areas to implement "forceful persuasion" for immunization injections, totaling more than 25,000 people injected. Today, injections and epidemic prevention propaganda will continue in the above-mentioned locations. (4) Four additional home disinfection teams were dispatched to disinfect various homes. (5) The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the American Red Cross provided a large number of syringes, alcohol, cotton, and needles, and the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan sent a quantity of vaccine for 100,000 people. (6) The headquarters of the U.S. Army stationed in Shanghai sent 10 trucks, the Executive Yuan sent 4 trucks, and the Police Bureau sent 2 ambulances, along with 5 vehicles from the Health Bureau, totaling 21 vehicles to transport epidemic prevention workers to and from their destinations. (7) Fixed immunization injection stations, undertaken by various practicing physicians, have been set up at 200 locations. The number of injections must be reported after one day. (8) Guo Keda, professor of bacteriology at the National Shanghai Medical College, together with Director Miao of the Health Laboratory of the Health Bureau, went to various epidemic hospitals to plan treatment, and starting tomorrow, they will implement temporary anal swab collection methods to culture cholera bacilli. (9) U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Lono reported by telephone that six naval medical officers would be dispatched in three days to participate in the city's epidemic prevention work, with the required equipment provided by themselves. (10) The Boy Scout Council will dispatch some Boy Scouts starting today, and the General Labor Union will酌调dispatch cadres to assist the Epidemic Prevention Team in its work starting tomorrow.

Epidemic Prevention Committee Moves into the Municipal Government

[Our Own Dispatch] Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei pays close attention to epidemic prevention work. In addition to expanding publicity, he is also actively strengthening the organization of the Epidemic Prevention Committee, mobilizing staff from various departments and soliciting specialized talent to carry out work. The committee has moved into Room 315 on the third floor of the Municipal Government starting today. The telephone number is 12410, extension 14. If people have inquiries or cholera patients need medical treatment, or have questions about home disinfection, they can directly request guidance from this office. According to the bureau's report, on the 15th of this month, there were 24 patients and 3 deaths. On the 16th, there were 11 patients, and there are no statistics for yesterday's patients, but 2 have already died. Therefore, the cumulative total is 272 cases and 28 deaths.

Banning Unhygienic Cold Drink Stalls

The Health Bureau and the Police Bureau jointly organized 12 patrol teams and began two weeks ago to advise small stalls selling ice cream and shaved ice on the roadside to stop selling these unhygienic foods. However, the general vendors repeatedly refused to repent. Therefore, at 4 p.m. yesterday, 40 to 50 vendor stalls were confiscated. Responsible persons from the Health Bureau's relevant departments and the second section of the Environmental Health Division earnestly lectured them, placing the ice cream and shaved ice on the ground. However, to take into account the livelihood of these vendors, the buckets and other utensils were returned, and they were ordered not to sell these cold drinks again in the future. It is also heard that the Health Bureau will also ban roadside cold noodle stalls.

Also, Mayor Wu gave a broadcast speech at 8 p.m. last night at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, urging citizens to cooperate and earnestly promote epidemic prevention plans. He said briefly that the emergency meeting on epidemic prevention had already approved the entire implementation plan, and was only waiting for all sectors to step up implementation. We must not be afraid, just do it. Fear is useless, action is effective, and so on.

### Don't Give Up Your Rights: Get Your ID Card Quickly

[Our Own Dispatch] The city's population survey has been completed by the Civil Affairs Department. Because citizens come and go不定, and there are frequent changes, and some people have not registered, the department will conduct a rigorous review based on the National ID card. Currently, except for the 11th district, where the ID cards have not yet been stamped, the rest are prepared and ready. All of them are expected to be issued by the end of this month. According to Vice Director of the Department, Mian Changquan, citizens who have not applied for the National ID card should do so quickly, because in the future, when food and supplies are allocated, they will be distributed according to the ID card, so citizens should not give up their rights. At the same time, with the ID card, a detailed investigation of the city's population can be conducted. Children under the age of fourteen are to be registered on their parents' ID card.

### Fourth General Meeting of the Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee

[Our Own Dispatch] The Shanghai Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee held its fourth plenary committee meeting at 5 p.m. yesterday. Director Du Yuesheng was absent due to business, and Vice Director Wang Zhixin served as chairman. The operating rules were passed item by item, prepared for approval by the headquarters. Then, the general rules for listed securities were reviewed, and the market layout was discussed. The meeting had not ended by 9 p.m.

### A Bunch of Air Traffic News

[Our Own Dispatch] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has received 15 U.S. landing craft, L.S.T. and L.S.M. types, which have been renamed with Zhong (中) and Hua (華) prefixes. Zhong No. 108 is scheduled to carry gasoline to Yuezhou today, which is the first landing craft to set sail. The company's Jiangshun vessel was originally ordered to serve military duties, but yesterday afternoon at around 5 p.m., the order was revoked. It is now scheduled to sail to Hankou on Thursday, carrying passengers and cargo.

### Yuasa Torakichi Sentenced to Four Years and Six Months for Abusing Prisoners

[Our Own Dispatch] The case of Yuasa Torakichi, former manager of the enemy Shanghai prisoner-of-war camp, abusing our prisoners, was sentenced by the military court yesterday. The main text of the judgment is as follows: Yuasa Torakichi is sentenced to imprisonment for four years and six months for continuous injury and abuse. This is the second case of a Japanese war criminal sentenced by the military court after Shimo da Jirō.

### Wen Lanting Refuses to Appear in Court for Trial; Persuaded from All Sides; Refuses to Leave Prison; Asks for a Quick Judgment; Expresses No Need to Bother, Anything Goes

[Our Own Dispatch] Among the "Three Old Sea Men" rebellious sons, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou, except for Yuan, who has been sentenced to life imprisonment, and Lin, who has been tried once, only Wen Lanting is still in the investigation period at the High Prosecutor's Office and has not yet been indicted. However, it is heard that he has repeatedly told the prosecutor, "There is no need for more trials, just give a quick judgment." Therefore, he once refused to be tried. The office also summoned Wen Lanting from prison, intending to open a court for investigation, but unexpectedly he refused again, saying, "Trying is the same as not trying, why bother, you can judge as you please." Despite persuasion from all sides, he refused to leave prison. Later, it was rumored that the bailiffs would be forced to carry him to court, causing reporters to wait all day at the prison gate, intending to capture the scene of him being "forced into court," but he was not seen leaving until late. It is rumored that the reason Wen Lanting is doing this may be due to the stimulation he received from Yuan Ludeng being sentenced to life imprisonment.

### Advocating Thrift and Promoting Health: Everyone Eats Brown Rice

Mayor Wu once said at a reception for the press that brown rice contains more abundant vitamins than white rice and is more nutritious than white rice. Why doesn't everyone eat brown rice? He also suggested to the government that the whole country should implement it uniformly, saving the manpower and material resources wasted on milling rice. We believe this is a valuable suggestion, but what is the difference in nutritional value between brown rice and white rice? To this end, the reporter went to "UNRRA" to interview a nutrition expert. The expert happened to be away on official business. Dr. Chen, who was busy preparing a report on the nature of food in various parts of the north, spoke with the reporter and handed the reporter a table analyzing the texture of white rice and brown rice. After reading this table, readers will be able to understand the nutritional value gap between white rice and brown rice. A translation is recorded below: (numbers are percentages)

It can be seen that brown rice contains more vitamins, especially vitamins B, A, and C, which are pitifully low in white rice.

Recently, at a municipal conference, a resolution was made to prohibit the milling of high-quality fine white rice. The standard for husking should be no less than five dou of brown rice from each shi of grain; the standard for machine milling should be no less than nine dou each of indica rice and durum wheat from each shi of brown rice. According to the research results of foreign expert Mr. Aufrey, eating brown rice is not only beneficial to health, but also increases the amount of rice by at least 10% to 15%. According to this expert's opinion, milled brown rice can be divided into the following three types: (1) Superior brown rice contains approximately 2% rice husks, 5% red rice, and 10% broken rice; (2) Medium brown rice contains approximately 2% rice husks, 10% red rice, and 20% broken rice; (3) Inferior brown rice contains approximately 3% rice husks, 15% red rice, and 30% broken rice. Because brown rice has a red skin to protect it, it takes more time to cook, but in fact, the fuel consumed is much less than the cost saved by brown rice. Because: 1. White rice needs to be milled two or three times more than brown rice; 2. White rice loses 10% to 20% more weight than brown rice.

The rice milled by villagers using stone mortars is more time-consuming but richer in nutrition than rice milled by milling machines. Recently, the municipal government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the Bean and Rice Industry Association to prohibit the milling of high-quality white rice. It is also stipulated that the cost price of rice should be based on the cost of grain, plus milling fees, transportation costs, and the indirect costs of retail stores. Looking at it this way, people in Shanghai will probably not be able to eat high-quality white durum wheat rice for long. (Ding)

### Zheng Hongnian: Old and Feeble, Claims to Be a Puppet; No Real Power; Faints in Court, Briefly Interrogated and Returned to Custody

[Our Own Dispatch] The "Central China Railway Company," which controlled the entire railway transportation business in Central China during the enemy-puppet period, was an institution jointly established by the enemy and puppets. Its "President," Zheng Hongnian, was interrogated yesterday morning at the Criminal Second Division of the High Court by Judge Xiao. Zheng is now 72 years old, a native of Panyu, Guangdong. He has successively served as the Deputy Minister of Finance of the Grand Marshal's Headquarters and the National Government, the Chief Quartermaster of the Guangdong Military Government, the Director of the Jingfeng Railway Bureau, and the President of Jinan University, among other positions. During the July 7th Incident, he was still a member of the Legislative Yuan. When Hong Kong fell in December of the 30th year of the Republic, he was unable to escape in time and was captured by the enemy and detained for more than a hundred days. Later, under the inducement of Wang Jingwei, he came to Shanghai to serve as the "President" of the "Central China Railway Company" until the victory. The institution was used to control transportation and promote aggression. Zheng's participation in the work clearly constituted collaboration with the enemy and treason. Therefore, after the victory, he was arrested by military agencies, and the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of traitor. Zheng, bald and with white hair, was clearly old. He argued in court yesterday that he did not participate willingly, but was arranged from Hong Kong to come to Shanghai to take the post. However, the company was a commercial institution, not a political organization. He had never attended the company's shareholders' meetings. All positions above the level of section chief in the company were held by Japanese, and he had no real power, like a puppet. Zheng fainted in court and requested to be returned to custody first. The court ordered a change of date for further interrogation after investigation.

### Ye Jiajun Discusses Methods for Improving Transportation

"This newspaper reports" City traffic is chaotic, and vehicles are often congested. The municipal authorities are eager to improve the situation and will convene a meeting of all relevant departments on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss improvement measures. A reporter met yesterday with Mr. Ye Jiajun of the Sino-American Transportation Improvement Research Committee. According to him, fundamental solutions to improve transportation, such as elevated trams and underground passages, are difficult to implement in the short term due to limited funding, materials, and experts. What can be done now are only stopgap measures. The most congested area currently is the central business district. The authorities plan to convert Henan Road and Sichuan Road into one-way streets: vehicles on Henan Road will only travel from south to north, while vehicles on Sichuan Road will only travel from north to south. In addition, the areas and times for rickshaws to operate will be restricted, and parking lots will be designated along the Bund, Suzhou Creek, and Avenue Edward VII for motor vehicle parking. However, detailed measures must await discussion and decision at the meeting on the 19th. Mr. Ye also stated that the number of traffic police is now fewer and their quality is also lower compared to the former concession era, and the authorities are working to improve this situation. Furthermore, some measures often encounter difficulties in implementation. For example, the conversion of Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road into one-way streets was agreed upon long ago, but has not yet been implemented.

### Solutions to the Housing Shortage in the City: Restrictions on Residential Housing Should Be Implemented; Xiang Xueru Submits Suggestions to Mayor Wu

Xiang Xueru, director of the preparatory office of the Shanghai Social Service Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has formulated measures to address the housing shortage in the city and has submitted suggestions to Mayor Wu Guozhen. The main points are as follows: (1) Residential housing in the city should be restricted, with each person allowed no more than 100 square feet. All surplus housing exceeding the limit must be automatically rented out (calculated by population, not by household, because household sizes vary; calculated by square footage, not by room, because room sizes vary). (2) If residents are unwilling to rent out surplus housing exceeding the limit, the competent authority may levy a residential housing excess tax, with progressive tax rates. (3) Residents should not occupy taxable housing exceeding three times the prescribed residential area. (4) Residents should automatically rent out excess housing as prescribed or declare and pay taxes to the competent authority. (5) All vacant entire buildings and apartment owners in the city should automatically rent them out; otherwise, forced rental will be implemented. (6) All vacant land in the city should be used to build houses within a specified period; those who fail to comply will have the land requisitioned by the city government to build affordable housing.

### Tram Hours Extended After Curfew Lifted

### Japanese People's Thinking Has Been Taught a Lesson by the War; Zhu Shiming Discusses the Achievement of Re-education

General Zhu Shiming, Chinese representative to the Allied Council for Japan and head of the Chinese Mission in Japan, told reporters yesterday that the thinking of the Japanese people has improved after the lessons of this war. In the future, Japan will be permanently disarmed, and the so-called democratization and re-education work will achieve success after a considerable period. As for the issue of war reparations to China, the principles will be decided by the Allied Far Eastern Commission. Currently, Japan's domestic economy is experiencing considerable panic, and some factories have not yet been rehabilitated. There is a strong desire for the reparations issue to be resolved as soon as possible. In addition, there are currently about 30,000 overseas Chinese in Japan, mostly engaged in the hotel industry, and their lives are quite difficult. Mr. Zhu also mentioned that MacArthur's headquarters has allowed Japan to fish in international waters to alleviate the Japanese food shortage, which does not affect our fishing rights. Mr. Zhu explained that the situations of various countries are not the same, and our mission has a smaller number of people, currently about 100. According to news from the Mission in Japan, Division Commander Dai Jian has gone to Haiphong. It is not yet determined when our troops stationed in Japan will be sent to Tokyo. Zhou Maobo, Wang Shubei, Wei Yao, and other experts, a group of more than 20 people sent by the Resources Committee to Japan to investigate industrial equipment, are waiting for a flight to Japan.

### Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau Explains Responsibilities and Policies

[This newspaper reports] Jiang Biao, Director of the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, hosted a reception for newspaper reporters at the Duchen Hotel yesterday afternoon to report on the purpose and work of the bureau. He said that the main purpose of the bureau is to supply materials under government loans, assist various ministries and commissions in purchasing goods abroad, and handle payment matters. However, all materials will be sold for cash in principle and included in the budget of each ministry and commission to balance the overall national budget. For example, cotton imported under the U.S. cotton loan will be handled by the China Textile Corporation, timber will be handled by the China Trust Bureau, and landing craft will be handled by China Merchants. To date, the bureau has only received U.S. surplus materials within China, including more than 30 ships and approximately 10,000 tons of military grain. Negotiations on Pacific War surplus materials have not yet concluded. For the distribution of military grain, public education personnel have priority. However, because the purchase price is extremely low, only one-quarter of the market price, it is easy to generate monopolies, resales, and other malpractices. Therefore, distribution is strictly handled according to the principle of punishing traitors, and only the individual is allowed to collect the materials. A trial run is being conducted in Nanjing and will begin shipping this Wednesday, with sales starting next week. After a month of trial runs, it will be implemented in this city. The Supply Bureau recently leased 981 new five-ton U.S. military trucks, which have already been unloaded. The leased materials also include hardware, materials, tools, etc., but all materials do not include military firearms because the U.S. Congress does not allow them to be sold.

### Large Reservoir to be Built in Taiwan; Can Irrigate 6,000 Hectares After Project Completion

[News from this city] According to news from the Taiwan Provincial Government, in the county of Gangshan, Taiwan, there is a river called the Agongdian River, which is 38 kilometers long and has a drainage area of 153 square kilometers, 80% of which is plain. It has great economic value, but the riverbed slope is relatively gentle and easily clogged, especially during flood season, causing serious damage. In 1934, it caused a major disaster, inundating more than 4,000 hectares, and public and private losses were incalculable. In view of this, the former Taiwan Governor-General began constructing a diversion channel in 1936, but with little effect. In 1942, a large reservoir project was started to build an earth dam capable of storing 45 million cubic meters of water. If it can be completed according to plan, it can not only regulate the water volume and prevent river flooding, but also provide irrigation and water supply.

The Japanese started this project as early as 1942, and by early 1945, it was more than half completed. Unfortunately, the project was largely destroyed by an extraordinary flood last summer. After the government took over, the Taiwan Provincial Department of Industry and Mining and the Public Works Bureau sent personnel to investigate several times and believed that it was necessary to continue construction. A project office was specifically established for this purpose. The total cost of the project is estimated at NT$42 million, to be completed in three years. The embankment section was started in May of this year, and the main dam section will be started after the flood season. If it can be successfully completed, it can not only reduce flood volume by 50%, but also irrigate 6,000 hectares of paddy fields and provide water supply for 30,000 residents. The national economy and people's livelihood will benefit greatly.

### Ghostwriter Confesses to Exonerate Brother-in-Law; Five-Year-Old Murder Case Finally Comes to Light

[This newspaper reports] Farmer Wang Tisheng, who lived in Lujiazhai, Jizhi Bridge, Nanhui for generations, married Wang Cihua five years ago (the woman is the younger sister of the ghostwriter Wang Xiaoyi, but from a different mother). Wang was addicted to opium and scorned by his neighbors, so quarrels constantly arose between the couple. Wang had a cousin, Wang Changgen, who is now 20 years old and from a well-off family. In 1942, he was robbed twice. Afterwards, Wang Changgen mistakenly believed that his uncle Wang Tisheng was involved. He conspired with his long-term worker Xu A'gen and gangsters Tang Haisheng, Xu A'jin, and Li Shaofu to murder Wang Tisheng. Four years ago, they lured Wang Tisheng out at night, tied his hands behind his back, and drowned him in the river. Since then, Wang Changgen (who was only 16 at the time) lived with his aunt Wang Cihua as husband and wife. Wang Xiaoyi heard about it, but lacked evidence and those people had great power, so he did not dare to report it. After the enemy surrendered last year, Wang Changgen secretly came to Shanghai with Wang Cihua and lived in hiding at 132 Fuyou Road, acting as husband and wife. Recently, Wang Xiaoyi finally found out and reported it to the Yemiao Branch. The police, led by police chiefs Bai Wenqi, Hong Yucheng, and Wang Wenjie, arrested Wang Changgen, Xu A'gen, and Xu A'jin after much effort. They confessed to their crimes. Accomplices Li Shaofu and Tang Haisheng died in a fight last year over the distribution of stolen goods. Wang Cihua's adultery was not prosecuted because the original informant did not want to pursue the matter. The interrogation of the three arrested suspects has been completed, and they will be transferred to the judicial authorities today for strict punishment.

### Constructing Shanghai, Facility Planning, Progress Status: Director Zhao Reports at the Municipal Government Yesterday

[This newspaper reports] The Shanghai Municipal Government held a memorial week yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Secretary-General He Dequi, directors of various bureaus, directors of various departments, and municipal government staff totaling more than 400 people attended. Mayor Wu led the ceremony. Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau reported, stating that the main work and the progress of the planned facilities of the Public Works Bureau from the restoration of the city last year to September were as follows:

Road Engineering

The city currently has a total road length of approximately 1,000 kilometers, including approximately 300 kilometers of asphalt roads, and approximately 200 kilometers each of macadam roads and cinder roads. During the enemy-puppet period, there was excessive damage. According to a survey at the time of takeover, it was estimated that 300,000 square meters of road surface needed to be repaired. In the past six months, due to the increased vehicle load, the road surface has been unable to bear the weight, and there has been continued destruction. Therefore, routine maintenance has been extremely difficult. In the past nine months, more than 500,000 square meters of road surface and sidewalks have been repaired and newly built. Currently, the monthly area of road surface repaired is approximately three times the monthly amount last year. Road surfaces that have been completely renovated include Wujiaochang, Jinji Road, Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Jiaotong Road in the city center, the section of Zhonghua Road extending to the airport, Hongqiao Road, and the slow lanes of East Zhongzheng Road. For a permanent solution, it is planned to select major traffic arteries and gradually renovate them thoroughly.

Widening Road Surfaces

First, the main arteries will be opened up and widened, in principle to develop traffic in the suburbs, so as to solve the current abnormal phenomenon of concentration in the central area. In addition to the road widening project of the section of West Nanjing Road near the racetrack progressing smoothly, the opening of the boundary road westward through Xinmin Road to connect with Tibet Road, and the widening of Zhejiang Road are progressing slowly due to the difficulty of demolishing houses to make way for the road. However, widening Huashan Road so that the heavy vehicle track in West Shanghai can be connected from north to south is currently particularly necessary and is being actively prepared.

Widening Fees

In order to expand roads, the bureau must levy construction fees on the spot, as the city treasury is tight. The method has been resolved and passed by the Provisional Council and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. The calculation method is based on the distinction between benefited area and benefited line. The benefited area is charged a fee based on the increased land price, and the benefited line is charged a fee based on the prosperity of the market. It is hoped that citizens will understand the purpose of this funding and the fairness of the method, and fully integrate with the government to assist in construction.

Flood Prevention and Flood Control

The city is low-lying, especially in West Shanghai. The inherent weakness is that the water pipes west of Guizhou Road and Huashan Road are approximately 12 inches in diameter. Whenever there is a rainy season and high tide, accumulated water is difficult to drain. The bureau has formulated an overall flood prevention plan, aiming to ensure smooth drainage and prevent backflow, with both short-term and long-term solutions. The estimated cost is 14 billion yuan and will take more than a year, which is beyond the current financial capacity. Even for short-term solutions, more than 2 billion yuan is needed. Currently, only the most urgent projects are being carried out first, at a cost of 800 million yuan. They will be completed in August of this year, and the autumn floods can be alleviated.

Bridges and Docks

The city has a total of 222 bridges, large and small, excluding small bridges that cannot carry vehicles, 16 bridges spanning the Suzhou River, and 35 municipal docks, with 27 in Puxi, all of which have been severely damaged. In the past nine months, they have been repaired in order. There is also a plan for a bridge over the Huangpu River to develop Pudong.

Affordable Housing

The city's housing shortage is serious. It is initially planned to build 3,000 buildings, with the city providing funds. Construction of 150 buildings on Damuqiao Road in Nanshi began on June 1.

Parks and Nurseries

The city has 13 parks that have been opened to the public. In the past nine months, the number of visitors to the parks has totaled 3.5 million. Five nurseries have been established, and 3,000 street trees have been replanted.

Repairing Seawalls

The total length is 28 kilometers. It is currently planned to repair them urgently, which will cost 3 billion yuan, to be borne equally by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration and the Municipal Government. Repairs have already begun at the southern gap of the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach. Currently, only the first phase of 500 million yuan has been allocated by the Municipal Government. The difference is too great, and with rising prices, it is feared that the small amount will be difficult to meet the needs if it cannot be allocated on schedule.

Director Zhao also said that Shanghai is the only major commercial port in the East. In order to transform and construct a new Shanghai, the bureau has an urban planning design committee, hiring experts to conduct research and design. The bureau has a thorough and detailed survey of the city's road system and waterway system, and has completed 1/10,000 and 1/25,000 scale road maps of the entire city, which will be published by Zhonghua Bookstore and will be available soon.

### Housing Allocation Committee Faces Many Problems; Occupants Found Using Gold Bars to Pay Rent; How to Handle?

The Executive Yuan's Shanghai Municipal Housing Allocation Committee held a subcommittee meeting yesterday afternoon. The issues to be discussed are scheduled to be presented at a meeting to be held at the Municipal Government this afternoon at 3:00 PM: (1) There are many requests from various agencies for housing allocation, and the order in which they should be allocated is unclear. (2) In the former Japanese residential areas, there have been cases of current occupants using gold bars to pay rent; how should this be handled? (3) The housing allocation applications previously submitted by various agencies often fail to report information according to the prescribed items, such as the number of employees and the number of repatriated personnel, which are not filled in accurately. Therefore, it is difficult to make allocations. A second application form has been issued. If it is not supplemented accurately in accordance with the regulations, it will be considered an automatic waiver of rights, and it is proposed that the General Assembly not allocate housing to them.

### Real Estate Market: "Tong Yu Chun Wind" Proud Building. Ants Whispering About Price. Who Says Shanghai Has Few Houses? I Ask You, How Many Gold Bars Do You Have?

After this victory, it seems the whole world is experiencing a housing shortage, but Shanghai is different from London and New York. The housing shortage is causing business to thrive, so a "Real Estate Market" has emerged.

In the Jiangnan area, when real estate transactions are mentioned, everyone thinks of "ants." Actually, "ants" are real estate brokers. Why are they called "ants"? Because once termites get into a house, the pillars will quickly be eaten away beyond repair. These ants rely on houses for their survival; when the house is destroyed, the ants grow fat. In a way, real estate brokers and ants are indeed somewhat similar. Although this nickname is somewhat harsh, it is quite in line with the facts.

The so-called "Real Estate Market" is actually a gathering of these "ants." Strictly speaking, the organization of this market is neither rigorous nor is the pricing reliable. Rather than calling it a "market," it would be more appropriate to call it a "tea party." These tea parties are held in more than one place. Larger transactions take place at "Tong Yu Chun" at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shimen Road, while smaller transactions take place at the "Wind Proud Building" in the City God Temple in Nanshi. The gatherings take place in the morning. Although many of the "ants" are opium addicts, they will still arrive on time and are rarely late.

When business is booming, there will be five or six tables of tea drinkers in "Tong Yu Chun." They chat about everyday matters, no different from other tea drinkers, except that these five or six tables of people know each other better and are more intimate. They are very alert and will suddenly change the subject as soon as they notice someone listening to them.

Ants Speak, Good at Reading Faces

If everything is calm and there are no "suspicious figures" nearby, they will start talking about business. Who says Shanghainese have few houses! There are plenty of houses here, as long as you have gold bars. The tone of the conversation is roughly like this: "There's a two-story house on Longfu Road with a telephone, eight gold bars, needs to be quick." They are unwilling to reveal the address right away, for fear that someone will negotiate directly, causing the ant's commission to be lost entirely. There are seven or eight to a dozen such houses for sale each day. There are people whose job is to collect information about vacant houses from all directions and present it at the "market," so the ants go out and get busy. Once a transaction is successful, the errand runner also gets a commission.

The ants with larger networks are mostly managers or directors of so-called real estate companies or real estate departments of trust companies. They have "funds" available, and if they see a good house at a low price, they will sometimes advance the money themselves to "hoard" the house, add a little paint, or put in some cheap furniture, and when they "unload" it, they can make a lot of profit.

Smaller ants rely on commissions at the time of the transaction, also known as "one-tenth head," because the commission is roughly one-tenth. However, if the number of gold bars is really too high, then the commission will be less than one-tenth.

In addition to the commission, there is a difference between "transferring ownership" and "not transferring ownership." The person looking for a house naturally hopes to "transfer ownership" on the lease, to ensure their security, but if you want to go through this procedure, you need more gold bars, sometimes one-tenth, sometimes even more than one-tenth!

The level of the lease fee naturally depends on the location, the size of the house, whether there are sanitary facilities, whether there is a telephone, etc. According to current market prices, roughly in the French Concession, a one-and-a-half-story house with sanitary facilities costs about six gold bars, and if there is a telephone, it costs about one more bar, "commission and transfer of ownership are extra" (this is the most frequently heard sentence, in other words, the more you can raise the price, the more you benefit). Sometimes, it is possible to lease a house for four bars, but if the location is not remote, there will certainly be no sanitary facilities.

Highest Record: More Than Seventy Bars

The highest lease fee, it is said, was more than seventy bars, for some newly opened jewelry stores at the busiest intersection of Old West Gate in Nanshi.

However, Shanghainese are quite generous, but how many people can casually take out five or six gold bars? So, although the market is lively, few transactions are actually completed. Most of the opportunities for hoarding houses are created by so-called real estate companies and trust companies, because they can publicly advertise to attract customers, while ordinary ants, under the repeated orders of the authorities, no longer dare to show their faces as they did before.

I once asked a friend who was very familiar with those ants, "Since business is so slow, why not lower prices and sell off?" He said that the sub-landlords also have their own difficulties in asking for lease fees, because if you want to lease out a house, you have to guarantee that you can clear out the tenants so that the person who takes out the gold bars can move in immediately. But won't those subtenants also be experiencing a housing shortage after they move out? So those subtenants also want to receive gold bars before they are willing to leave, and they will take those gold bars to lease another house. The lease fee for the house is five or six gold bars, and even the most shrewd landlord can only get two or three bars at most, and the rest is given to the tenants and ants. (Ping Xiao)

### Promote Overseas Chinese Education Increase Funding to 3.6 Million Customs Gold Units

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] According to a person from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, although China's international status has improved after the war, overseas Chinese have not yet obtained legal status due to their low level of knowledge. Therefore, the promotion of overseas Chinese education is urgent. In order to strengthen the overseas Chinese education institutions and ensure that the work can be carried out smoothly, the government transferred overseas Chinese education affairs, which were previously under the Ministry of Education, to the commission. Moreover, teaching materials for overseas Chinese education are being actively compiled and printed by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation. The Executive Yuan has also approved an increase in the funding for the restoration of overseas Chinese education to US$3.6 million. The focus of overseas Chinese education is to promote the glory of the motherland and train overseas Chinese in survival skills. Not only should schools be established in various places overseas to educate Chinese children, but also social education and cultural institutions for overseas Chinese should be established to achieve significant results. However, the current difficulties are the lack of awareness of overseas Chinese education among Chinese people and the lack of qualified teachers for overseas Chinese education.

### Zhu Kezhen Talks About the Restoration of the General School of Zhejiang University and Will Persuade Professors of the Hangzhou Branch to Resume Teaching First

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Dispatch] Zhu Kezhen, president of National Zhejiang University, previously went to Guizhou to preside over the restoration of the school. He has now returned to Hangzhou after completing his official duties. The reporter visited him and was told: The General School has five colleges: Arts, Sciences, Law, Agriculture, and Engineering, as well as research institutes. There are more than 1,600 students in the main division, more than 400 students in the attached middle school division, and 400 faculty members. This time, upon receiving the order to restore the school, the ministry allocated 370 million yuan for restoration, 150,000 yuan for each professor, and 120,000 yuan for each student. Therefore, most of them have recently left Zunyi and traveled by car to Changsha, then by boat via Hankou to Shanghai and Hangzhou. However, due to difficult transportation along the way, only more than 700 students have arrived in Shanghai. After the restoration of Zhejiang University, in addition to the above six colleges, there are also the Teachers College in Hangzhou and first-year students in the Colleges of Arts, Sciences, Engineering, and Agriculture. It is planned to add a College of Medicine next semester, so the school buildings are far from sufficient. Although the Ministry of Education has allocated 800 million yuan for construction, it is only enough to build college buildings on the original site of Huajia Pond. The remaining funds of several billion yuan are still needed, and it is planned to submit a request to the Ministry of Education to find ways to raise funds. As for the entire faculty and students of the General School, it will take until mid-October to arrive completely, and the next semester will be extended to November 1. The professors of the Hangzhou Branch stopped teaching due to unreasonable salary adjustments. The author has appealed to the Ministry of Education in Beijing, and Minister Zhu is very concerned and promised to submit the matter to the Executive Yuan meeting. Since the end-of-semester exams are approaching and the holiday will begin on the 7th, it is requested that the representatives of the professors' association be persuaded to return to Hangzhou and resume teaching first in order to maintain the students' studies.

### Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Prepare for the Establishment of National Advanced Printing Vocational School

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Special Dispatch] The printing industry has a direct relationship with education and culture, and is an invention of our country, but due to the past tradition of apprenticeship and the lack of good education and research facilities, it has lagged behind. The printing industry is listed as an important sector in Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan. During the war, the Ministry of Education successively prepared to establish one national paper making and printing vocational school each in Sichuan and Jiangxi. Due to various wartime restrictions and difficulties, the content and equipment were mostly simple and had to be considered temporary in nature. Now that the capital has been returned, Nanjing is once again the political and cultural center. In order to promote the basic tools of culture and meet the needs of national construction, it has recently been decided to establish another National Advanced Printing Vocational School in the capital, and to purchase all the latest printing equipment from Europe and the United States, and to attach a complete printing factory. Yu Guoyi has now been appointed as the director of preparations. Yu has studied printing in the United States for more than ten years, and has also studied printing in Germany and other European countries. The development of the school is promising. [Yu]

### Primary School Curriculum Research Forum (8): Support for Exempting First Graders from Arithmetic

After reading Shang Wu's article "First Graders Should Be Exempted from Arithmetic" in this column, I felt that he is a meticulous person and that he can understand the minds and intellects of young children in great detail. I very much agree with his suggestion because I have also experienced this situation.

My second son, Lesheng, is my most ideal child. He has an innocent and lively attitude, a strong and lovable physique, and an exceptionally clever mind. He is not yet four years old this year and is still eligible to receive the relief center's milk powder. Because of his superior mental abilities, I taught him to recognize characters before he entered school. Two months ago, I bought a box of color-picture block characters at the bookstore, and during my spare time from work, I taught him four characters every day. It only took me about ten minutes to teach him these four characters, and he remembered them well. Moreover, he could distinguish between characters with similar strokes, such as "力" (lì, strength) and "刀" (dāo, knife), "瓜" (guā, melon) and "爪" (zhuǎ, claw). He has now recognized over two hundred characters. However, I discovered a very strange thing, which is that these two hundred characters include the ten numerals. Except for the numbers "一" (yī, one), "二" (èr, two), and "三" (sān, three), which he did not confuse, he had a very difficult time remembering the other seven numbers from "四" (sì, four) to "十" (shí, ten). Sometimes he would read "五" (wǔ, five) as "七" (qī, seven) or "六" (liù, six) as "八" (bā, eight). When asked about "九" (jiǔ, nine), he would shake his head. After being reminded, he would forget again. Once, I was reviewing with him, but as soon as I asked about the ten numerals, he became confused. When asked about "六" (liù, six), he immediately shook his head without pretense. I saw six teacups on the tea table and immediately had an idea. I picked up three teacups and asked him how many there were, then picked up another three teacups and asked him how many there were. He answered the two "three" counts, but I asked him to add these three teacups to those three teacups, and he still couldn't do it. Later, after I added them for him one by one, he reluctantly answered the number "six" that I had asked him.

If even a child who is considered intelligent has such difficulty recognizing numbers, how can we blame Shang Wu's son, Ling Ling, for not being able to do addition and subtraction! At the same time, I understand that when a child's intellect is not yet fully developed, teaching him to recognize characters should be entirely with nouns, and they should be concrete. Because he can see, hear, and touch concrete things at any time, which suits his experience and makes them easy to remember. For example, when I teach Lesheng the character "鐘" (zhōng, clock), he easily remembers it. This character "鐘" (zhōng, clock) has a total of twenty strokes, which is three strokes less than the total number of strokes of the ten numerals, but compared to each numeral's noun, it is already close to abstract. When you hold up three fingers, it's called "三" (sān, three), but three teacups are also called "三" (sān, three), and even three large houses are called "三" (sān, three), which makes the child feel strange and makes it difficult for him to remember. When we suddenly see this example, it seems that the children in the world are too stupid, how can people know that raising three fingers is three, and three water houses do not know is three? We must know that children are children after all, and their understanding is not as good as that of adults. This is like a mathematics master who is proficient in triangles, geometry, algebra, and arithmetic. When he goes to the vegetable market to buy meat, no matter which butcher says how much to buy, the butcher cuts it off with a knife, which is the amount of weight he wants to buy, and the price is also blurted out without thinking, which is very accurate. When this butcher cuts meat, he does not need to prove it with triangular geometry, and when calculating the price, he does not need to write calculations with algebra and arithmetic. If you are joking, if you want the mathematics master to be a butcher and calculate the price, you can borrow paper and pen, or solve it with a lot of brainpower, but if you ask him to cut meat, it will be good for him, he can’t draw dotted lines, measure angles, and cite theorems on the meat, and finally cut the piece of meat to pieces, and still not get the weight. What is this for? The mathematics master has no experience in cutting meat, just like children can't do arithmetic, they feel that this is strange.

Therefore, I support Shang Wu's suggestion: "First graders should be exempted from arithmetic." It is best for first graders to be given a "counting" concept while drawing or playing games to prepare them for future arithmetic instruction. (Cai Renheng · Thirty-five · Six · Ten)

### Anhui College and Anhui University Merge; Anhui University Preparatory Committee Resolves in Beijing

[Our Hefei Report] All the students of the Provincial Anhui College and the Tunxi Branch College in Southern Anhui, upon hearing the news that the Ministry of Education and the Preparatory Committee of the National Anhui University had resolved to establish the National Anhui University at the original site of the former Provincial Anhui University in Anqing, to take over the books and instruments of the Provincial Anhui University, and to discontinue the Provincial Anhui College next semester, were greatly shocked and repeatedly petitioned the Provincial Government to reorganize the Provincial Anhui College into the National Anhui University to avoid starting from scratch. Subsequently, Chairman Li reached a compromise and telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that the students of the original departments of Anhui College be incorporated into the National Anhui University. Wang Shaolun, Director of the Anhui Department of Education, Cheng Yansheng, President of the College, and Ye Yuanlong, Director of the Relief Department, also went to Beijing to request a merger with the Ministry of Education. The Preparatory Committee of Anhui University also held a meeting in Beijing and resolved to pass the merger principle, but the merger method has not yet been decided. Now, Director Wang Shaolun returned to Hefei on the 9th. According to him, the matter has been decided by the Ministry of Education and the Preparatory Committee of the National Anhui University. Students of Anhui College can transfer to the National Anhui University according to the transfer procedures. If students still wish to study at the College, Anhui College will continue to operate in the next semester. The books and instruments of the former Blood-Soaked Battle Established Anhui University will be distributed and used by Anhui University and Anhui College. The National Anhui University will still use the former site of the Provincial Anhui University in Anqing and will start school in the autumn. (Chao)

### Nationally Designated Textbooks; Unified Printing, Unified Sales, Large Supply; Children's Bookstore and Four Other Companies Also Participate; Vigorous Crackdown on Pirated Editions Everywhere Recently

[Dahua News Agency] The seven-company joint supply office for national textbooks has recently moved from Chongqing to Shanghai. It has been decided that textbooks for the autumn semester nationwide will be printed locally and supplied in large quantities in Shanghai, Chongqing, Beiping, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, where supply committees will be established separately. Supply teams will be set up in each province and city. In addition to the funds that have been raised and advanced by each company as much as possible, negotiations are also being held with the Four Joint Banks for loans. As June is nearing its end, the China Bank has been requested to release the loan in advance as an emergency measure and will send personnel to audit various uses to ensure sincerity and credibility. Taking Shanghai as an example, it is estimated that the number of books produced this autumn can reach at least five times that of last autumn. The number of prints in other recovered areas is even greater. It is expected that the book shortage situation this autumn will not occur. In order to make supply and demand more appropriate, in addition to adopting the unified printing method, the office also intends to adopt the unified sales policy as much as possible. It has recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to the local education departments to pre-order books directly from the local branch offices. For areas where transportation is difficult, please also assist in solving the transportation problems. Those who pre-order from the schools can enjoy preferential prices, but they must pay a portion of the book price in advance, or the local bank is responsible for guaranteeing and ordering on their behalf so that they can be printed and shipped on time. It is heard that unified sales contracts have been agreed in several places. The office is now hiring lawyers to contribute copyrights from each company in accordance with the contract of the Ministry of Education, and actively carry out the crackdown on pirated editions in various places in accordance with the Ministry's order to save the finalized proof paper type of the subject. The office will also demand compensation for various losses from the infringing groups, printing factories, and vendors in accordance with the law. It is also heard that the Children's Bookstore, China Cultural Service Society, Independent Publishing House, and Victory Publishing Company have also participated in the supply.

### Two Football Giants from Hong Kong and Shanghai; Star East and Qingbai Meet; 4:30 PM Today at the Recreation Ground; Evenly Matched and Will Have a Fierce Battle

The Hong Kong Star East United Expedition Football Team has made four appearances and won all battles, showing great power. At 4:30 pm today, it will play its fifth match against the Shanghai champion Qingbai team at the Recreation Ground. Qingbai is a double champion of the Mayor's Cup and the A-League, which will be a major test of the Star Army's league strength. The intensity and excitement of the competition at that time can be imagined. The person in charge of the Football Committee announced yesterday: The ticket prices remain the same, but the ticket sales time will be brought forward to 2:00 pm and will still be sold at the City Stadium. The competition time has also been changed to start at 4:30 pm. In addition to the Fuxing Road gate, the Shaanxi South Road gate will also be opened at the entrance of the Recreation Ground.

Lineups of the Two Teams

After arriving in Shanghai, Star East first defeated the British Navy, then captured the Western United, and then defeated the Jews three times. Last weekend, it won against Donghua with a score of five to two. The strength is strong, and the momentum is grand. Today, they will meet their powerful enemy Qingbai. They will definitely do their best to win the game. In terms of lineup, there is no change in the front five tigers. The midfielder Liu Songsheng moves to the left, Guo Yingqi injured. The position of right front, old tune is repeated, the striker is sharp, the defender is firm, the arrangement is quite ideal. Qingbai is still the original team. Goalkeeper Qin Bigao and Huang Shijie will each play half a game. The defender Yan Wu's file, as like as two peas, is active. It is feared that it will be difficult to cross the final barrier. The key to today's victory or defeat lies in the respective methods of the Qingbai striker and the visiting army's defender.

Today's Winner or Loser

Today's Qingbai is undoubtedly the biggest strong enemy of Star East. The number of wins or losses is difficult to predict. Analyzing the strength, the high and low are very small. With Star East's neat, brave, quick, skilled, and final long-term strength, it is not unreasonable to say that it can win Qingbai. However, Qingbai's defender can be said to be two iron gates, and the midfielder is no weaker than Star East, then Star East's attack, whether it can be as desired, is also a question. Therefore, whether Qingbai's striker can break through Star East, the victory or defeat can be determined, and the strength and physical strength are also important factors in today's victory or defeat.

Shanghai League Game Will Not Be Held

The Football Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon. Due to the urgency of time and the hot weather, the game of Star East in Shanghai decided to end with the game against Hualian on the 21st.

After that, the charity game will be decided after the team returns to Shanghai. The Football Committee has received many letters from various charity organizations in the city requesting to hold football charity games in recent days. Yesterday, the Star East team also received a joint letter from Fan Shaozeng, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shizhao, Du Yuesheng, and Gu Jiatang, inviting the team to have a triangular cycle charity game with Western United and Qingbai. The ticket income will be used to relieve the victims in Henan and northern Jiangsu. The Football Committee is discussing whether to hold it.

### After the Ministry of Finance Announced That It Will Continue to Repay Principal and Interest as Usual, the Black Market Price of Public Bonds Plummets

Most of the industry did not agree, and the news that the Ministry of Finance has announced that it will repay the principal and interest of the pre-90,000 yuan debts as usual from July 1 has already been announced. The black market sentiment has been hit hard, and many parties are rushing to sell. The unified C opened in the morning and plummeted by more than 1,000 yuan, reaching 1/4 of the value, which was still difficult to find a counterpart. It only traded when it fell to 3,000 yuan. The short side covered and once saw more than 3,300 yuan. The bulls added to close the position, and the halfway meeting fell by 2,200 yuan before it was maintained. The short side realized that the situation was too serious, and stopped at the right time. A certain bull on the seventh floor even added more codes, and gradually recovered to above 3,000 yuan before the end. As a result, the closing price plummeted by 1,500, A and B fell by 800 yuan, 850 yuan, and Wuzhua also fell by 800 yuan. With such organization and such a way of doing things, retail investors and foreign funds should wake up as soon as possible.

### Gold Price Stable

Huo Chi was extremely stable yesterday, opening at around 1.88 million. The US dollar was weak, and the gold price was inevitably affected. It fell from 1.885 million to 1.86 million. Afterwards, the US dollar gradually improved, and the decline was maintained. The central allocation was 150 bars, the price was 1.87 million. Since then, there have been fewer activities and limited transactions. The overall trend has been sluggish, and it is still hovering within 1.88 million at noon. In the afternoon, the rise of the US dollar rebounded, and the gold price was also brought up to around 1.89 million. As a result, it rebounded by more than 10,000 compared with last Saturday. Jewelry gold rose from 198,000 to 200,000. Silver and silver dollars were stable. The interest rate for informal lending ranged from 12 cents to 15 cents.

### Chinese Stocks Are Cautious at High Levels; All Close at the Bottom Price; Yongshen's New Shares Have Already Risen

Chinese stocks are also wary because they have risen too much. Yongshen's new shares started trading, and the opening price actually shouted a new high price of over 700 yuan. Outsiders could not get rid of this price. 675 yuan was the official high price. Soon after, the sales pressure was small. Other stocks were even worse, and almost all closed at low prices. The small stocks were even more tired. As a result, the closing price of Yongshen Meiya fell by about 50% or so before the closing, Jingfu Xinguang Qinxing each fell by less than 10%, the unpopular mid-sized stocks fell slightly, and the small stocks fell by about 50%. The veteran stocks all showed an oversupply, and the buyers were on the sidelines. Foreign stocks were also affected by the emergence of the old ones. They were afraid that the yarn would enter the 11,000 yuan range as soon as it entered the market, and it continued to fall after opening, lacking maintenance. The supply still exceeded the demand. Except for Yeguang, which did not have many chips and was in good condition, the others were loose. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yeguang was flat, and Yisha and Jardine fell by about 50% or so. British Union and small stocks fell by 10% to 15% or so.

### The Yarn Market Sees Both Glory and Dishonor; Spot Cotton Transactions Are Generally Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market was developed by the Guangdong gang, and they were particularly fond of 20-count Double Horse yarn, which led to the sudden increase of more than 70,000 units of spot yarn. Other large yarns such as Golden Rooster Dafa also followed up by 30,000 to 40,000, but the medium and small 10-count yarns were very mediocre, and the 16-count yarns also lacked vitality. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, and there were supplies for sale from 1 count to 100 counts, and the price was 20,000 to 40,000 lower than the previous bid, and the buyers were quite enthusiastic.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton market was closed for holidays, and there were no telegrams. The local spot cotton market was generally weak. It was heard that Hua Hao had exchanged 12 dan and 60 jin of Pengjiapo cotton for a package of Dasheng Factory's 20-count Hong Kui Xing yarn, and there were about three or four packages of exchange transactions. It is said that the price of Hong Kui Xing was 1.19 million yuan. Apart from this, there were no openings from other factories, and only the industry had a few embellishment transactions.

### Artificial Silk Breathing Greatly

Morning and Afternoon Difference of Sixty to Seventy Thousand Yuan

Yesterday, the artificial silk market initially showed weakness, but ultimately recovered to firmness. No. 1 and No. 2 Tianqiao brand (with luster) opened at 1.48 million yuan, reaching 1.5 million yuan in the morning. The market improved in the afternoon, reaching 1.54 million yuan. The final asking price in the afternoon was 1.57 million yuan, a large increase of 10,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Miscellaneous brand No. 120 (with luster), such as "Beauty," had a minimum price of 1.4 million yuan in the morning, later reaching 1.44 million yuan, and finally an asking price of 1.47 million yuan. Xuhui had a minimum price of 1.38 million yuan, reaching 1.43 million yuan in the afternoon, both rising by about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. 150 Jin San Ma had a minimum price of 1.45 million yuan in the morning, and still remained around the Saturday level of 1.5 million yuan in the afternoon. No. 75 Jin Ji semi-luster had a minimum price of 1.55 million yuan in the morning, later reaching 1.58 million yuan, and an asking price of 1.6 million yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, the price difference between morning and afternoon for artificial silk was as high as 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, because the market was filled with rumors of selling off in the morning, leading to a price drop at the opening. In the afternoon, there was no shortage of bargain hunters, and the asking price gradually increased. 78-filament factory silk with high uniformity opened at 2.33 million yuan. 72-filament 3-grade new single medium-grade silk was traded at 2.18 million to 2.2 million yuan. A user's silk asking price was not much different from last Saturday. Single-piece goods of 30-filament warp had a price of 1.8 million yuan. User's warp was still priced at 1.55 million to 1.6 million yuan, but there were no transactions. Silk fabrics were slightly weaker yesterday. Meiya bed covers were down 50,000 yuan per hundred compared to the end of last week. Dacheng checkered Bige crepe was priced at 5,440 yuan per "ma" (unit of measurement) in the morning, slightly better in the afternoon, reaching 5,700 yuan, down 130 yuan from last Saturday. Kang Sheng's goods were generally stable. Yesterday, Hangzhou native silk opened at 83,000 yuan per 100 taels, factory warp at 2.1 million yuan per "dan" (unit of measurement), dry warp at 1.7 million yuan per "zu" (unit of measurement), flower silk at 1,600 yuan per tael, Changtou Luo at 1,840 yuan per tael, power-loom spun silk at 55,000 yuan per bolt, checkered spun silk at 43,000 yuan per bolt, and checkered Geji crepe at 34,000 yuan per bolt.

### Fifth in Oil Production, Now Belongs to Saudi Arabia; China Actively Pursuing

(Reuters, London, 17th) According to the annual report of the California-based Mobil Oil Company, Saudi Arabia's oil production this year may reach 7 million tons. In 1945, the region's production was 3 million tons, and in 1938 it was 67,000 tons. It has now become the fifth largest oil-producing region in the world, second only to Iran.

Due to the hasty preparations during its establishment, the China Petroleum Corporation under the Resources Committee is still continuing to advance various matters that need to be handled after its establishment. Currently, the company is strictly evaluating the movement of personnel in oil fields and oil refineries across the country, and is also actively promoting three plans: (1) preparing to establish oil refineries in various regions; (2) exploring oil production in various regions, mainly in the Northwest and Taiwan; (3) increasing and improving the production of existing oil fields. It is reported that due to inconvenient transportation recently, no oil has yet been shipped to Shanghai for supply.

### Mercantile Bank Business Report: Prerequisites for Exchange Rate Stability: One is Resurgent Exports, One is Balanced Domestic Revenue and Expenditure

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Mercantile Bank, in its annual report, extended its condolences to all staff in the former occupied areas of the Far East, and stated, "This year, our report is able to include the latest figures from branches in China, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Malaya, so the figures listed this time are more accurate than in the past. In China, branches in Shanghai and Tianjin have already begun operations, and representatives have also been dispatched to Hankou and Qingdao to prepare for resumption of business. Britain and the United States abandoned the unequal treaties in 1943, and other countries followed suit, so the bank is now subject to Chinese laws and tax systems. The Shanghai foreign exchange market has been revived since the Central Bank announced management measures on March 4. However, foreign exchange is allocated to necessary imports of medicine. Under this circumstance, needed import businesses have benefited, and the exchange rate is relatively stable. However, ultimate stability depends on the resurgence of exports and the balance of domestic revenue and expenditure."

### Hunan Lotus Root Lacks Momentum to Rise; Dried Scallops Trend Firm

Cloud ear fungus and preserved mustard greens have similar supply and demand, and are relatively active. Hunan lotus root lacks momentum to rise due to the influx of Raozhou lotus root. Dried scallop prices are high and sales are sparse, due to scarce inventory, and the trend is firm. Rapeseed, bottle gourds, star anise, and sago rice are supplied in a steady stream, with scattered sales, so prices are falling. Mushrooms, dried shrimp, Job's tears, and agar-agar are in demand due to the season, sales are brisk, and the trend is firm. Dried whitebait is also showing signs of strength. Other goods are generally stable.

### Britain Controls Siamese Rice

Surplus Must First Supply Southeast Asia

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 16th] Siam, a small country in Asia, had a rice surplus of 1,500,000 tons last winter. At a time when Asian countries need about 3,000,000 tons of rice to relieve famine, this surplus is urgently needed by other countries. In January of this year, Britain signed an agreement with Siam stipulating that Britain would control Siam's surplus of 1,500,000 tons of rice. Britain needs this rice to supply Burma, Malaya, and India. China is also suffering from famine this spring and is eager to obtain a portion of this surplus rice from Siam. However, Sir Kellan, Special Commissioner of Singapore, stated that Siam's surplus rice is "not excessive" in view of the needs of all Southeast Asian countries. In any case, transportation is a huge difficulty. This statement indicates that besides exporting to British colonies, there is no desire to transport rice to other countries.

### Dodge Trucks: 9.15 Million per Vehicle

The huge surplus of US military supplies in the Pacific theater is being negotiated for purchase by the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan. The first batch arrived in Shanghai yesterday on five US military transport ships, loaded with a total of 961 Dodge T-234 5-ton trucks, totaling 6,846 tons. The goods are scheduled to be unloaded today and will be openly distributed for sale in the short term. The selling price has been set at 9.15 million National Currency.

### Economic Briefs

Industrial oils and fats have seen sparse transactions in recent days, due to weak supply and rising prices at the source. Users here are adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to the sudden price increase.

(Taipei News) The former Bank of Taiwan was formally opened for business on May 20 after reorganization, acting as an agent for the Central Bank's business in Taiwan. It is reported that six other banks, including the Industrial Bank of Japan, Sanwa Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and South China Savings Bank, will also be reorganized into local banks.

### Rice Market Still Unchanged, Coarse Grains and Oilbeans Fall Weakly

Yesterday, registered rice arrivals in the city were over 5,000 shi (unit of volume), but the market situation remained unchanged. Flour fell back 300-400 yuan, wheat bran also slightly 200 yuan. Oil prices plummeted 2,000-3,000 yuan with the influx of goods from various sources. Soybeans are also trending towards stability. Beans saw a surge in arrivals from various places, with prices falling another 500-600 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes also weakened by 200-300 yuan. Weak rural consumption and slow sales of wheat, with slightly more arrivals, led to a price decline of 1,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Sales Active

Recently, the tea market has been strongly supported. Red and green teas, both in local stores and from the Suzhou-Yizhou area, are being sold continuously. It is also reported that the tea market in Suzhou is extremely optimistic. Mid- to low-grade goods require about 100,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), so those holding goods in this city are all hopeful, and their willingness to sell is twice as strong as before. Supply is frequently decreasing, and the situation is regrettable due to demand exceeding supply. In terms of prices, Wenzhou Mingchun new Qiqiang has risen sharply again compared to last week, and other varieties are also sharp. As for the foreign tea market, British merchants Jardine Matheson and Concordia have sent senior Chinese personnel to Fuzhou to operate.

### Coal Market Quiet

The coal market is experiencing quiet trading, and industry players are grumbling. Only those urgently needed are showing some interest, with very scattered transactions. It is rumored that some of the newly arrived Yangquan coal blocks have a strange odor when burned, affecting sales, and many cargo owners are eager to sell, leading to continued weakness in prices. Hongji and Jiaozuo coal blocks are of better quality and have fewer arrivals, and sellers are not as eager to sell, so prices remain stable. Sales of bituminous coal are also quiet, and market prices remain unchanged. Coal balls and firewood remain stable.

### Sugar Prices Tighten Again

Sugar prices tightened again yesterday. The sugar market saw renewed movement in sales, continuing to tighten. The guild's morning benchmark price for medium-grade white sugar was 92,300 yuan, then rose to 94,000-94,500 yuan. The afternoon price rose further to 95,000 yuan. The morning price for Shuang sugar was 91,000-91,500 yuan, rising to 93,000-94,000 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 4,000-5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price for local cotton white sugar was 100,000 yuan. Hao goods (well-known brands), Shantou Qing was offered at 73,000-74,000 yuan, Mianchi at 93,000-94,000 yuan, and slightly lower at 90,000 yuan, totaling over 200 bags. Zhangdiao Qing, over a hundred bags, was offered at 71,000 yuan. Xinghua white was 100,200 yuan. Yuanlou-packaged ice was 95,000-115,000 yuan.

### Summer Fabrics and Woolens All Fall

Summer fabrics and woolens all fell at yesterday's public tea party. Everything from Valentinos, Palaces, feather yarns, four-ply woolens, white pique, white Zhigong, Fassco, Shek Siting, and Ma Gao cloth saw reduced asking prices. Generally, cargo owners were willing to cut prices to sell off inventory, as most of the peak selling season has passed. If they were to raise prices again, the goods would inevitably be shelved. After a certain period, new orders would inevitably arrive in port, simply adding to interest expenses. However, buyers, aware of this situation, showed little interest, leading to a downward trend. However, retail sales have not yet shown any significant price reductions.

In the foreign exchange market, news reports that the Central Bank had notified designated banks not to accept US dollars to offset US exchange quotas caused considerable panic among holders. Immediately, they slashed prices to around 2,550 yuan, pressing down to below 2,500 yuan, creating an extremely chaotic situation. Operators widened the buying and selling spread on small quantities, at one point differing by 100 yuan. Later, the situation stabilized somewhat due to bargain hunters, recovering to around 2,560 yuan, struggling around 2,580 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, cotton settlements poured in, rising to around 2,630 yuan, a net increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous close. The forward spread of 744 yuan was compressed to around 718 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars saw increased demand from importers and also recovered 5 yuan, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 465 yuan, and the Indian exchange rate at 570 yuan, both seeing selling pressure. The US exchange rate remained flat on the surface but stagnant underneath. The Central Bank issued a notice on the 15th regarding

### Central Bank Notice: Goods Not Allowed for Exchange Settlement

On the 15th, the Central Bank issued Notice No. 45, notifying all designated banks as follows: From now on, any designated foreign exchange bank shall not accept foreign currency notes for exchange settlement for the following imported goods and other purposes:

(1) Prohibited imports (all items listed in Table 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Import and Export Trade): prohibited luxury goods, lace, clothing, embroidery, pure wool or mixed wool carpets and other floor coverings, pure silk or mixed silk, musk, ivory products, antiques, perfumes, cosmetics, and other goods.

(2) Imported goods listed in Central Bank Notice No. 42: perfumes, cosmetics, shaving soap, vanishing cream, toothpaste, talcum powder, hair oil, and other cosmetics for hair, mouth, teeth, and skin, apples, unspecified fresh fruits, dried fruit confections, desiccated coconut, lemons, oranges, artificial rosin, and other moldable products, cosmetic tools (such as combs, brushes, etc.), steel pen nibs and fountain pens, and other unspecified office supplies, canned food. However, if such imported goods have already been loaded onto ships en route to China, importers may pay with frozen foreign exchange, but only for goods shipped before June 15.

(3) Other imported goods and uses not approved in advance by the Central Bank.

### Taikoo and Jardine Resume Sailings: A List of Passenger Ticket Prices

[Hong Kong News] "Taikoo" and "Jardine" shipping companies have gradually resumed coastal and Southeast Asian routes. The prices set by these companies for passenger tickets from Hong Kong to Singapore, Xiamen, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Shantou are as follows: "Taikoo" prices: From Hong Kong to Singapore, first class 300 yuan, second class 240 yuan, third class 180 yuan. From Hong Kong to Xiamen, first class 150 yuan, second class 100 yuan, third class 50 yuan. From Hong Kong to Shantou, first class 120 yuan, second class 80 yuan, third class 50 yuan. From Hong Kong to Shanghai, first class 240 yuan, second class 120 yuan, third class 60 yuan. From Hong Kong to Tianjin, first class 450 yuan, second class 250 yuan, third class 125 yuan. "Jardine" prices: From Hong Kong to Shanghai, first class 300 yuan, second class 200 yuan, third class 60 yuan. From Hong Kong to Shantou, first class 150 yuan, second class 100 yuan, third class 40 yuan. All prices are in Hong Kong dollars.

### Traditional Chinese Medicine Declines More Than Rises; Guangdong Merchants Inquire

The traditional Chinese medicine market has seen more declines than rises recently, mainly due to the continuous supply and the reverse of sales trends. Due to the current situation, Northern merchants have not made large purchases, only Guangdong merchants have made some inquiries, adding a slight touch of activity.

### Lingnan Lychee: "Gualu" Exceeds 100,000 Yuan Per Jin, Ordinary Goods Have No Buyers

[Guangzhou News] Zengcheng Xiyuan Temple's "Gualu" lychee is a Tang dynasty relic. Due to several vicissitudes, cultivation was neglected, and one of the original three branches withered, reducing fruit production. In the spring of 1937, the agricultural colleges of "Zhongda" and "Lingnan" Universities, together with the Guangzhou Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Station, sent agricultural experts to the temple to conduct detailed research, apply fertilizers, and use scientific irrigation. After a few months, new branches thrived, and more fruit was produced. The temple was then turned into a park, with "Fragrant Lychee" planted throughout for visitors to enjoy. After the occupation, the trees in the park were destroyed by the enemy. Fortunately, this tree remained unharmed. During the Chongqing period, every year the fruit was harvested and seized by soldiers and presented to enemy leaders. Last year, the harvest was 128 lychees, and this year only three and a half jin (unit of weight). The current selling price is 100,000 yuan per jin, or 5,000 yuan per lychee. A month before the fruit ripened, customers had already registered in advance, and later customers were willing to pay 150,000 yuan but could not get any. According to the owner of the tree, Mr. Liu, 5,000 yuan per lychee is not expensive. Before the war, one lychee could be exchanged for 100 jin of grain. Now 100 jin of grain is worth tens of thousands of yuan. Compared to that, the price is much cheaper.

Guangdong province has a bumper harvest of ordinary lychees, with smooth arrivals from various places. The price is 150 to 200 yuan per jin, but there are no buyers, mainly due to severe grain shortages and the prevalence of epidemics. Lychees are easily infected, so there are few buyers. Comparing this situation with the aforementioned "Gualu" lychees reveals a vast difference.

### Taiwan Longan

Previously regarded as enemy goods, after Taiwan's return to the motherland after victory, it has become a true domestic product. According to Taiwan news, this year's longan seedlings are very scarce. It is estimated that this year's new goods will require a near-90,000 yuan Taiwan old currency exchange cost, which will be difficult to make profitable.

### Loyal Souls Forever, Crimson Blood for Eternity! Public Memorial for Lieutenant General Dai Li

— Yang Yanbing

Nanjing, 12th Dispatch

On the clear morning of June 12th, the weather was unusually gloomy. At the entrance of 357 Zhongshan East Road, plain white horses were prepared. Relatives and officials came in succession to the public memorial for the late Director Dai Yu-nong.

In the center of the memorial hall was the late Director Dai's portrait, with President Chiang's inscription of "Crimson Blood for Eternity" above it. The National Government's commendation order was posted next to the spirit, and elegiac couplets and wreaths decorated the interior and exterior of the memorial hall.

### President Chiang

— Mourns the Heroic Spirit

At around nine o'clock, President Chiang, wearing a grass-green military uniform, accompanied by Song Ziwen, Bai Chongxi, He Yaozu, Liu Jianqun, and others, walked into the memorial hall amidst mournful music. After offering incense and wreaths, he proceeded to read the eulogy, which read:

"On this, the twelfth day of June in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Chung-cheng, Chairman of the National Government, respectfully offers wine and flowers to the spirit of the late Director Dai Yu-nong, saying: Alas, the sound of drums and trumpets frequently resounds, and the scourge of war continues. Every man has a duty to sweep away the stench of evil. Who would have expected that one morning, this hero would fall? My heart is wounded by this loss, and my inner organs are in torment. Remembering back to Whampoa, you received instruction, gifted with talent and possessing unique insight. Your ambition surpassed the ordinary, and your steps were as swift as a thoroughbred horse. You faced danger and walked on thin ice, never looking back. During the Northern Expedition, you served as a vanguard, venturing into the enemy's den, skillfully deploying military strategies. You quelled the chaos in Jiangbiao, offering insightful advice. You analyzed doubts and presented strategies, diligently participating. You maintained discipline and diligently oversaw the heavy workload of transportation. You meticulously uncovered the hidden, leaving no stone unturned. You patiently sharpened your abilities like twisting a cow's horn. You secretly planned brilliant schemes, securing our borders. Your victorious calculations reached far and wide, pacifying the distant regions. The enemy's petty schemes vanished without a trace. Reflecting on your accomplishments, your contributions are truly great. Against the Japanese invaders, everyone feared your strategic prowess. Your plans to assess the enemy and eliminate traitors were perfectly executed. You investigated corruption in government and the embezzlement of public funds, leaving no wrongdoing unexamined. You revived decaying customs and upheld the law of the land. You were relied upon as a vital support, managing the central government. You upheld justice and integrity, and the people praised your arrival. You worked even harder to defend against incursions, employing unique tactics that shattered enemy forces and brought credit to our army. Friendly nations admired your exceptional skills, and you were hailed as a model of excellence. Your outstanding achievements surpassed those of your peers. Your integrity shone brightly, and your conduct was always honorable. Numerous awards were bestowed upon you, yet you always remained humble. Your virtues and high character are admired by the world. You diligently contemplated your duties and hoped to mend the heavens. With light words of triumph, I painfully visited every corner. Suppressing traitors and capturing rebels was your paramount duty. Your sudden departure has left a void in my heart. Your solitary light shines brightly among the stars. Remembering the hardships of the times, I deeply mourn the loss to our party. Your death is irreplaceable. Your loyalty and bravery are an example for us, and your contributions should be recorded in history. Praising your achievements and honoring your virtues, the people will never forget you. Pure wine is offered here; come and partake." At this point, the atmosphere became even more somber. President Chiang silently bowed his head in contemplation, then exited the memorial hall amidst mournful music.

### Americans

— Successively Pay Tribute

After President Chiang led the public memorial, Wu Jingheng, Dai Chuanxian, Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Chen Lifu, Wu Dingchang, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Zhu Jiahua, Zhou Zhourue, Liu Wendao, Xu Kan, Gu Weijun, Xue Yue, Zheng Jiemin, and hundreds of others followed. Colonel Berry, representing Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, came to pay his respects, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Hagy, Lieutenant Colonel Es, and Major Ace. Colonel Berry was the Chief of Staff of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO). He had spent time with Dai day and night. In February of this year, he went to Suzhou with Dai to reorganize the Loyal Salvation Army. In the three years they spent together, he felt that Dai was the most approachable, kind-hearted, pragmatic, sincerely supportive of the central government, quick to act, and never gave up until he achieved his goals. Therefore, Dai's death at a time when the war of resistance and nation-building was full of complex tasks was not only a loss for China but also for SACO, which lost a good friend.

Colonel Berry's Chinese and English signature for this newspaper:

Berry talking about General Dai

In total, over three thousand people participated. During the period of cooperation with China, SACO had the following achievements: killing 26,799 enemies, wounding 11,642, capturing 508, destroying 183 bridges, 158 sampans, 35 steamships, 1 aircraft, 425 train cars, 271 warehouses, railways, and rescuing 130 Allied pilots. SACO focused on meteorological and meteorological-related communication intelligence, organizing a meteorological network that included the Pacific region, providing intelligence to Allied fleets and land and air forces. Weather stations were set up in various locations, reporting enemy movements day and night, and detecting enemy ship movements to facilitate their destruction. When the reporter asked if Dai had any hobbies, Colonel Berry shook his head and smiled: "He didn't gamble, he absolutely didn't smoke, but at parties, he liked to drink. His maximum alcohol capacity was 160 cups of yellow wine at once, but he never got completely drunk. Slightly tipsy, he liked to give long, interesting speeches, without losing his dignity."

To commemorate a great Chinese man, a friend of the United States, and to commemorate the achievements of SACO, the US has decided to award a medal, which will soon be sent to China and given to General Dai's son. The US side of SACO will end its operations at the end of June, and from July onwards, the Chinese side will be responsible for continuing meteorological and communication intelligence work. Finally, Colonel Berry sighed and said: "China is losing General Dai at this time, which is indeed very sad."

The Old Lady Calls Out to Her Son in Dreams

Dai's younger brother, Mr. Yunlin Cangyi, arrived in Nanjing two days ago. Today, when Mr. Yunlin was asked by the reporter if the old lady knew about Dai's death, tears welled up in his eyes. From his elegiac couplet, one could know his sorrowful feelings: "His soul returns to Xianxia Ridge, surely knowing his old mother leans and waits; her eyes will wear through, his body remains in the Stone City, so that later generations can pay their respects, tears ready to fall."

Dai would always take the opportunity to go home and see his old mother once a year. This year, on the 27th day of the fourth lunar month, which was Dai's 50th birthday, his mother waited all day for her son to return, but now there will be no day of reunion. Yunlin Guang-sheng said: "To reduce my burden and to hope that my old mother would not have an accident, I have been hiding the truth from her until now. When she brought it up, I said: 'Chairman Chiang sent him abroad.' She asked again: 'When will he be back? Why hasn't there been any news?'" Mr. Yunlin finally said: "Pitiful white-haired old mother, still calling out in her sleep in the middle of the night: 'When will you come back?'"

The heavens suddenly began to rain, but the representatives of the people continued to come to the public memorial. This scene added to the grief and remembrance of countless comrades!

### Nationwide Railroad Strike in the US: A Tense Scene – Truman's First Test of Iron-Fisted Policy

— Special Correspondent in the US: Zhu Jiarang

New York Airmail Dispatch, 26th of this Month

The economic "civil war" in the United States is becoming increasingly fierce. On one side, there's the debate over price controls versus no controls, with ordinary citizens and large corporations locked in a fierce battle. On the other side, the conflict between labor and employers continues unabated. This battle spans the entire nation, involves various sectors, and the situation worsens daily. Industrial production relies on interconnected dependencies. If one wave subsides only for another to rise, how can the great cause of economic recovery be achieved? Moreover, things are deteriorating, to the point that even the lifeblood of this giant went on strike last week! Trains were completely halted, and stations had to close their iron gates. Isn't this absurd, and what kind of situation is this? Yet, the reality was truly this shocking!

Although the storm has now subsided, looking back at the two days of the strike, it instantly paralyzed the entire living national economic system, disintegrated its original functions, put the government to a great test, and caused a great panic in society. Fortunately, the authorities used their skills, the public offered united support, and national interests prevailed over class interests. As a result, two stubborn union leaders in their seventies finally bowed their heads and admitted, "President, we are patriots" (quoted from a letter to the President). The trains then started running again.

Speaking of democratic policies and maintaining stability, this nationwide railroad strike in the US can be said to have reached the highest peak of escalating labor disputes. However, observing its evolution, it may open a new chapter for future labor-management disputes. That is to say, things always have a saturation point. The American machine has been dragging its feet since VE and VJ Day, making a mockery of the word "production." If things cannot be produced and business cannot be done, how can things continue? Although the country emphasizes democracy, policies must be stable. Therefore, calls for labor legislation, reforms, and restrictions on labor unrest are rising, this being one reason. Secondly, the government will resolutely prevent major industries and transportation from experiencing further disruptions that would affect the shutdown of other industries. In general, if disputes occur and become unmanageable, the government will inevitably use the means of receivership to deter strikes because, at this point, striking would be tantamount to resisting the government. The government would then impose legislative sanctions. The failure of this railroad strike was due to not only withstanding the anger of the public but also withstanding the charge of "resisting the government." The impact will naturally have a positive effect on the future trends of labor unrest.

The evolution of this railroad strike itself is quite tortuous and bizarre, and it can be seen as a comedy. In terms of the process of the strike, the brewing was certainly not overnight. As early as July of last year, the 20 railway unions nationwide had already proposed a wage increase of $2.50 per day. At the same time, they also wanted to amend 45 work rules to increase income. In accordance with the first step of the Railway Labor Act, the authorities had them negotiate directly, but it failed; the second step was mediation, but it failed; the third step, in January of this year, was arbitration, but it also failed. Thus, the fourth step was for the President to appoint a fact-finding commission to investigate the actual situation and propose a plan. The result of the proposal was that wages should be increased by $1.28 per day (that is, 16 cents per hour), and work rules should be discussed separately. However, this plan was not accepted by the union, and negotiations broke down, so the union set a date for a strike.

### Nationwide Strike – The Entire Country is Shaken

The government is certainly facing a headache in dealing with recent labor unrest, especially President Truman, who bears a great burden. Although he has the Secretary of Labor and expert advisors to handle things together, the matter is still thorny. In particular, the two union leaders were strong-willed, making mediation very difficult. When the first strike date was approaching, they finally conceded a bit and extended the deadline by five days. However, during these five days, the progress was even slower than a "snail's pace." The President finally issued a receivership order and proposed a precedent of increasing wages by 18.5 cents per hour, while postponing the amendment of regulations for a year. Unfortunately, while the other 18 unions accepted, the leaders of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers still refused to listen and bluntly and disrespectfully replied to the President, "We have repeatedly told you that the workers are now very angry. Their demands cannot be refused…Therefore, your proposal cannot be accepted." The trains across the country were thus halted, starting at 4:00 PM on May 23rd.

The 348 main lines of the US railways, totaling 228,000 miles, encountered an unprecedented "rest," and the nation's economic life immediately faced a deep and serious threat. All factories that were previously obstinate simply closed down altogether. The food and fuel for the cities, which normally relied entirely on trains, were cut off. There were also dozens of cars of relief supplies that were about to be transported overseas to save lives, but they were unable to move, causing great anxiety. In addition, travelers were stranded, and commerce was frozen. (According to statistics, the national train passenger volume is 450 million per year, averaging three trips per person per year. In our country, it would be exactly one trip per person per year). This storm truly struck the hearts of everyone, shaking the entire country, and the impact was of course significant.

### Various Departments Respond Calmly and Effectively

Here, we have two noteworthy things that should be mentioned first. We will begin with the government authorities. Leaving aside the measures taken by the presidential palace, the preparations of the relevant departments in charge and their calm and effective response in the face of emergencies are admirable. From the start of the strike, the government's Department of Defense Transportation was continuously announcing contingency plans on the radio. All transportation adopted a priority system, determining what should be transported first and what should be stopped. All available air and water transportation tools were concentrated and kept on standby. The post office's emergency measures were to use air transportation for all letters while limiting the delivery of packages, setting limits on weight and size. Furthermore, local governments also separately informed the public, advising them to remain calm and stating that the city's food and fuel supply would not be exhausted in the short term. They also opened certain bridges and tunnels, and they mobilized long-distance buses to allow residents in suburban areas to use them as transportation, etc. This shows that their actions were not panicked, and everything was prepared. Secondly, in terms of the public, they were naturally worried, but their attitude was mostly calm. They were dissatisfied with the union's actions, but their analysis of the situation was relatively clear. They wanted to talk to their representatives and write letters to the newspapers. Many people felt that President Truman's response was somewhat weak. The number of letters and telegrams sent to the White House demanding action was said to be unprecedented since he took office. Thirdly, speaking of the workers themselves, the strike was originally voted on by themselves, so they naturally acted in unison. However, such actions only caused suffering to the masses, which was not their original intention. Therefore, some of the more senior workers put on civilian clothes and voluntarily drove back and forth to the suburbs several times to pick up and drop off working men and women. Although the number of trips was small, it showed their unique style. As for the train stations being deserted after the strike, it was inevitable. The workers did not form pickets because the railway had been taken over and temporarily belonged to the government, so if workers were to picket, they would be arrested according to the law.

### Angry Roars in the White House

The above is a paragraph. Next, we should talk about President Truman's first test of iron-fisted policy. On the second night of the strike, just as Congress was hotly debating a bill to stop the strike, radio commentators were vociferously criticizing the labor unrest on the air, and the President suddenly uttered angry roars in the White House office. From the recent movies, we can see President Truman's stern and tired expression. From the radio that evening, we could feel that the President's tone was low and slightly hoarse, and we can imagine how worried and overworked he was. However, that evening's speech was clear, powerful, sincere, and moving. At the same time, it combined kindness and severity, and it finally won the support of the public and the return of the striking workers.

The gist of President Truman's speech that day was to report on the handling of the situation, clarify where the responsibility lay, and explain the pros and cons of the matter, while ordering the workers to return to work. First, he explained that the nature of the strike was purely an act of rebellion against the US government. Second, he explained that the government could not expose its weakness and should actively respond. Third, he explained that the strike affected the lives and health of people at home and abroad, and the responsibility rested entirely with the two union leaders. Finally, he issued a 24-hour ultimatum, ordering everyone to return to work by 4:00 PM the following afternoon. Otherwise, he would send troops to operate the trains in order to maintain transportation. The President admitted to being a friend of the workers. In his previous role as a Senator, he had always spoken for the workers. However, this reckless act could not be tolerated. He especially severely criticized the two union leaders without any leniency. He compared this incident to the Pearl Harbor incident, except that the attack came from the domestic selfish interests of a few individuals. President's rare anger truly represented the common feelings of the majority of the people, and things took a sudden and dramatic turn. The next morning, representatives of the other 18 unions, representing 120,000 workers, were the first to sign the agreement, accepting the President's terms of 18.5 cents per hour. The two union leaders also immediately sent a letter to the President, expressing their willingness to negotiate again. However, the President ignored them. He was preparing to convene a joint session of Congress in the afternoon to deliver a speech, demanding emergency legislation. The unions had no choice but to admit defeat, fully sign the agreement according to the President's terms, and immediately agree to return to work. At this time, President Truman happened to be delivering a passionate speech in Congress, and the crisis suddenly passed, ending the comedy here.

### Emergency Law – National Interest Comes First

However, although the railway workers have returned to work, the coal mine labor unrest is still at a stalemate. The President's emergency legislation requests the power to crack down on acts of striking and resisting the government after the government has taken over, while also having the power to send workers into the military. At the same time, he hopes that Congress will formulate a fundamental plan to strengthen labor policies and protect people's lives. The applause from Congress also came from Republicans, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic scene, demonstrating that the general trend of the country has matured and become clear. This time may tell you that the long-standing labor unrest should come to an end. Furthermore, due to this railway unrest, we can also know that although the people's freedom must not be violated and the principles of democracy cannot be shaken, the nation still comes first, and the interests of the working masses are not the top priority. The interests of the entire public are the top priority!

### The End of the US Railroad Unrest: Half an Encore

New York Airmail Dispatch, 25th of this Month. Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

There are three busiest people on the fringe of the White House: Ross is one of them. It is never an easy task to properly deal with several hundred reporters, large and small. The second busiest is the President's advisor, Steelman. He is the person designated by the President to confer with representatives of both labor and management. I know that several times, the opinions of railway employees were forwarded to the President by Steelman. The third busiest person, of course, is the President himself.

### Three Busiest People in the White House

There are two central figures in the strike movement. They are also the targets of newspaper reporters. One is the leader of the train drivers' union, Johnston, who is tall with a long, thin face. The other is the leader of the railway workers, Whitney, a stout middle-aged man. These two "dictators" of the democratic country are now the most authoritative figures in the United States. Their words and orders control the transportation of tens of millions of Americans back and forth, as well as the prices affected by transportation.

However, Johnston himself told me that he is just a "transmitter" for 250,000 railway workers. He has no power to quell the labor unrest, nor does he have the power to promote it out of thin air. He said that there are many workers in the United States, and economic problems and economic disputes are also becoming more complex. "Compared to China, it is, of course, very different." I looked at his long, thin shadow, slightly trembling in the White House garden.

The order for the government to take over the nation's railways was issued by President Truman the day before he left the White House. An American colleague told me that everyone had high expectations for the government's takeover. In fact, the so-called "takeover" was originally temporary. The capitalists (the owners of the railway companies) said, "I cannot agree to the labor's terms. If I agree, I will lose money." The workers said, "If these conditions are not met, I cannot live." Therefore, according to constitutional practice, in this dilemma, there is a method for the government to temporarily take over. Since the government has taken over, the person in charge must also plan. The government is not a person with excess capital, so where does it get the money to lose for no reason? If it cannot lose money for no reason, there are more problems. On the day President Truman returned to the White House, his first major decision was to raise the salaries of railway employees. The railway companies had originally agreed to a wage increase of $1.28 per day, but the President decided to increase it by another 20 cents, changing it to $1.48 per day. However, the workers did not react because the crux of the problem was not the wage increase, but the improvement of service methods.

The railway workers and engine workers are very determined about these 45 points of method. From the beginning of the talks on President Washington's Monday to the outbreak of the strike, the talks yielded no results.

### "Isolated Island" New York

I returned to New York the day before the railway strike began (the 22nd). Before leaving, observations from all sides suggested that there would be no results. I feared that if the strike were to begin, I would not be able to reach New York and would be stuck in Washington, which would also be boring. After arriving in New York, I learned that the buses had already

At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 23rd, Pennsylvania Station on 34th Street in New York was truly an incredible sight. The iron gates of the station hall suddenly closed. Police with weapons were around. Outside the iron gates, there was a sea of people. Some were watching the excitement with nothing to do, while others were helping the old and young, carrying suitcases and luggage, unaware of the strike and intending to take the train. When they arrived at the station, they learned that the train had an accident. Dozens of locomotives and carriages lay quietly on the platform. The railway workers and workers had already slipped away.

The radio continuously broadcast news of the general strike, and newspapers sold extra editions. The citizens of New York watched the development of the event with a sense of half-surprise and half-curiosity. In New York, the most popular word now is "isolated island." "New York has become an isolated island," Governor Dewey broadcast to the people of New York, with this as the opening line.

Of course, the most serious problem for an isolated island is "food." The food for New York City, no, the food for the entire state of New York, is supplied by the Midwest. Meat is also the same. With the trains cut off, there are more problems. Governor Dewey and Mayor O'Dwyer believe that the only remedy is to mobilize all cars and planes to save this crisis.

There is a precedent for this. In 1922, there was a general strike on the national railways. But it did not occur after the government took over. The government took over the railways during World War I and returned them to the company immediately after the Versailles Conference was convened.

It is probably the first time that the government announced a takeover, and the result was still a strike. On the tram, an old lady angrily told me, "President Truman has no ability and has brought the United States to this point!" The tram turned from 96th Street to the Hudson River shore. As I looked at the turbulent waters of the Hudson River, I thought of President Truman's peaceful pace in the White House garden, of his anxiety lurking in his heart as he looked at the chaotic national affairs, and I felt that it was not easy to sing half an encore!

### Screening Method for Middle School Graduates During the Enemy Puppet Period

Dear Editor, Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued a registration form for screening middle school graduates from the enemy puppet period. The method for screening general middle school graduates from the enemy puppet period is very detailed, and it also requires writing a "Report on Reading the Three Principles of the People." We absolutely agree with this principle, but the method seems inappropriate. (1) Simply filling out this form as the screening standard may lead to people filling it out randomly and recklessly, and the authorities may not be able to discern the truth. At the same time, the submitted documents cannot be used as ironclad evidence. As everyone knows, everything was shrouded in secrecy during the enemy puppet period, and how could the education sector be an exception? Spending a little money, inviting a guest, and obtaining a graduation diploma was easy. Therefore, how can the documents submitted by students during registration be used as the standard for screening? (2) Regarding writing a "Report on Reading the Three Principles of the People," we think that students will naturally hope to pass the registration, so they will seek help from others to write the essay or even have it written for them, and even ask others to transcribe it. It is simply completely false, and how can the authorities discern the truth? (3) The review board treats normal school graduates from the enemy puppet period in the same way as the former. We believe that the academic qualifications of normal school students are certainly important, but experience is even more important. Experienced teachers with less academic qualifications may not necessarily be half as effective in their education. Today, the lives of public school teachers are difficult, as everyone knows. The enthusiastic service of normal school graduates from the enemy puppet period who are now teaching is worthy of admiration. Why are the authorities so harsh? The best screening method, in my opinion, is to have a collective screening examination and use the results of this examination as the standard, which would surely be more accurate. At the same time, I believe that those who fail the screening (whether normal school students or other middle school students) should be given training. Our country is in the initial stages of reconstruction, and various departments are lacking talent to work. Can the authorities bear to let go of this general group of young people? Reader Yuan Xiao, June 8th.

### The Methods of the French Water and Electricity Company

The Shanghai French Water and Electricity Company has always been highly skilled in collecting water and electricity bills from users. Before the return of the concessions, the prices of French water and electricity were always higher than those of British companies, Zhabei, and Chinese companies. Since the issuance of Reserve Coupons to collect legal tender at a rate of two to one, the company has used the excuse of increasing a deposit from users. Starting in September of the previous year, it also cleverly set up a so-called "meter maintenance fee" for users. The amount depended on the size of the meter, with a minimum of 25 yuan per month for each water meter and electricity meter. Later, it was repeatedly increased to 40 yuan, 80 yuan, and by the time of the Japanese surrender, it had risen to a minimum of 250 yuan per month for each meter. Even after legal tender was used, the French company maintained the name of the meter maintenance fee. Starting in January of this year, the Public Utilities Bureau discovered it and ordered the cancellation of this cleverly established meter maintenance fee, which was of course a good policy for users. However, the French company was unwilling to give up, so they used their clever methods again, adding a column called "Supplementing the Minimum Number" to the monthly water bill, meaning that an extra fee had to be charged in addition to the regular bill. The user never knew what the minimum number was, but no matter how much you used, you would have to add a few degrees of expense for nothing. Starting in April of this year, the French water price has increased from 50 yuan to 120 yuan per degree, but supplementing the minimum number is still being charged. I hope that the Public Utilities Bureau authorities will pay attention to this unreasonable behavior of the company. I suspect that the French company may exempt the users who are employees of the Public Utilities Bureau from this additional fee. Otherwise, how could they not know about it and fail to correct it?

### Tokyo, Autumn 1945

— Shao Fu

A friend brought back a book from Tokyo—"Tokyo, Autumn 1945," published by the Japan Culture Society. It is beautifully printed, with a striking crimson cover!

I finished reading all the pictures and discerned two themes hidden within them: "The Might of the Occupation Army" and "The Poverty of Tokyo." What these two themes tell the Japanese people about their own country is self-evident.

For example, there are images like "Occupation Army Road Signs at Yotsuya Mitsuke (place name)" and "A Line of Jeeps in Front of the Marunouchi Meiji Insurance Company"; and others like "The Remains of Ningyocho Seen from Kiyosu Bridge," "A Queue at a Tram Stop," "Street Vendor Scenes," "Homeless People Under the Saigo Takamori Statue," "Homeless People Within the Grounds of Asakusa Hongan-ji Temple," and "A Father and Daughter Near a Pond"...

It has been nearly nine years since I left Tokyo on August 10, 1945. This city once held my youthful dreams, and now, seeing the face of post-war Tokyo before me, I cannot help but feel nostalgic. Surugadai, Ichigaya, Yurakucho, Ginza; fishing used to be possible on Sukiyabashi Bridge, and rickshaws lined up in front of the Japan Theater. A foreigner could not imagine it.

The two predecessors who best understood Japan—Jiang Baili and Wang Jingwei—have unfortunately passed away one after the other. If they were still alive, they would tell us how the Japanese are preparing to weather the next five years, and what Japan will be like in those five years.

All of Japan has only one slogan now: "Reconstruction." The only slogan is "Reconstruction." Although the two old gentlemen, Jiang and Wang, have passed on, this picture book has answered the two questions above for me.

In my hometown, there is a legend of a mouse that steals oil and turns into a bat. Although this legend is unscientific, it is deeply meaningful.

### Mice

— Cai Renhou

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of "crick, crick, crick" of mice in the room.

This sound is very annoying, making it impossible to fall back asleep. First, I'm afraid it will gnaw on my only remaining broken box; second, I'm afraid it will chew through the leather shoes under the bed. And then there's a bar of laundry soap that I haven't put back in the box, and I'm afraid it will drag it away again.

Gradually, anger builds up in my body, and I leap out of bed in a "tiger jump." But by the time I put on my shoes and light the lamp, the mice have already run off. It's like scaring a snake too early. At this point, there's nothing one can do about a mouse. What can I do? I can only adopt a defensive posture, putting everything that might be invaded by the mice in a safer place. But by the time I blow out the lamp again and return to bed, I'm wide awake.

So, I inevitably developed a hatred for mice. During the day, I often see mice sneaking out of the sewers, with their timid eyes and pointed noses. They sniff around and crawl towards a stray grain of rice. I suddenly shout loudly, scaring it back into its hole, which is my way of getting revenge like Ah Q.

In my hometown, there is a legend of a mouse that steals oil and turns into a bat. Although this legend is unscientific, it is deeply meaningful. It reflects a social phenomenon: if you steal "oil," you'll find a way. For the mouse, it can become a bat and fly up to the sky. For people, those who steal oil and grease their palms are all well-fed and on top of the social ladder. I remember a minor clerk in the county government who hadn't even graduated from middle school. Somehow, he got into the county government, pocketed "interest" for a few years, and squeezed the people dry. After stealing oil and greasing his palms, he became rich, well-groomed, and dressed in a suit every day, showing off his importance, thinking he was a first-class person in society. He was a prime example of a mouse stealing oil and rising in the world.

Recently, I read a science report about the lifespan of mice, which is said to be a maximum of three years. It seems that every ten days a mouse lives is equivalent to a year for a human. So, living three years is equivalent to humans living eighty or ninety years, which is quite a long life. When we see a mangy, rotten-tailed mouse crawling out of its hole, we can't help but feel a little pity for it because it is really old.

Mice are afraid of cats. Generally, domestic cats can be divided into three types: The first type has the appearance of a cat but none of its abilities. Mice are naturally afraid of it, but in reality, it can only scare them. It can do nothing else. This is perhaps a bit like a school headmaster who is full of authority, forcing students to shave their heads, wishing he could shave the hair off their scalps as well, and forbidding them from wearing hats in the hot sun to show off his success in moral education.

The second type of cat has neither authority nor ability, but it has a flattering manner, always crouching at its owner's feet, eating and doing nothing. It neither catches mice nor recognizes what a mouse is. Of course, mice are not afraid of it. It doesn't meddle in other people's affairs and is carefree, a beloved pet.

The last type of cat can be said to be a true cat. It has both authority and ability. When mice encounter it, they are so scared that their bones soften, and they willingly wait for it to swallow them whole.

Once, I saw a hungry cat tied to a doorway. Somehow, it caught a mouse. I watched it eat the mouse bit by bit. It first ate the head, and the internal organs flowed out. Then, it ate the internal organs, and then the body. Finally, only the tail was left. I thought it wouldn't eat it, but after looking at it again and again, it seemed to think that leaving it there was inappropriate, so it ate the tail as well. I admired it greatly. Such a hero is truly the pride of our animal world!

Mice and cats are "mortal enemies," but mice never think of revenge. To deal with cats, they only have two options: "escape" or "non-resistance," "willing submission," and "being at the mercy of others."

However, those who study zoology know very well that there is rarely peace between mice. When they see their own kind, they point their noses at each other, bare their teeth, glare, and fight. They even devour each other's corpses. I once did an experiment. After catching a mouse, I fed it a poison called potassium cyanide and then released it back into its nest.

A few days later, the mice disappeared. When I dug up the floor, I found five or six mouse corpses. It turned out that they had greedily eaten the flesh of their own kind and were poisoned as a result.

However, although mice are timid, kill each other, and commit all sorts of acts that lead to the extinction of their species, they are fortunate to have a particularly high reproductive rate, which is rare among mammals. They can reproduce four times a year, with four to six offspring each time. Imagine, two mice can produce sixteen to twenty-four more in a year. No wonder there are so many of them. Who among us can rest easy?

### The Monte Carlo of the Orient

— Fang Jun

Macau is an outlet to the sea for Zhongshan, in fact, it is a port to Hong Kong. It does not occupy much land, and after several hundred years of operation by the Portuguese, it only has the scale of a modern city. After the "July 7th Incident," the Chinese strengthened some buildings there, making it look a bit more presentable. This can only be compared to Shiqi in Zhongshan. Compared to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, it is far behind. I rarely go out, so I am naturally very unfamiliar with my birthplace of Zhongshan, and I also have no impression of Macau, which I have passed through. However, my cousin has a particular fondness for it and returned there from the island of Hawaii in the Pacific to live there for a long time. However, his family was ruined there because of his fondness for it, because it is known as the Monte Carlo of the Orient.

In the autumn of eight years ago, I stayed in Macau for two days and two whole nights. On the first night, a servant at the hotel specially came into my room to introduce me to "Cha Cha Tan." I asked blankly what it was all about. From his explanation, I learned that he was introducing me to enjoy a woman who had just had her "rights of the first night" enjoyed by someone else. I found this euphemism very novel, but I was in a state of confusion, and my pocketbook could only afford me two meals at a "Da Dian," so I really couldn't accept his kindness, which caused me to suffer the servant's glare at the time. On the second night, I became a pimp who didn't spend any money. A friend of my brother invited me to play a few rounds of mahjong at a brothel in Xin Jie. I watched as they drew a lot of big money. When the feast was opened, I tasted Western white wine for the first time. After the feast was over, while they were putting out the candles and keeping their hair, I saw the wonders of the short doors inside two rows on the street, which were clearly very different and unusual from those in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin. Later, I went there twice, both short stays, and unfortunately, I didn't have the good fortune to "hang on the upper floor." I only walked from the park to Wansong Mountain on a rainy evening, and then from Wansong Mountain to the South Ring, enjoying some of the seaside scenery in the rain.

In my intuition, Macau is a place that hides dirt and accepts filth. It is not a big place, but there are many smelly roads. When I was young in the countryside, I saw many villagers go to Macau. After only a few days, they would take a mountain sedan back to the countryside. It is said that they brought back a lot of fruit. Greedy, I followed a villager once, but I didn't want to get any fruit, but I got slapped in the face and felt dizzy. After that, I dared not ask anyone for it. However, my little heart had already conceived that Macau was a place where fruit grew on people.

Occasionally, I read Wu Mojing's postscript, in which he had the following notes on Macau:

"Macau is also called Haojing. Not far from Macau, there are the customs of Greater and Lesser West. Its etiquette and customs are contrary to our village; for example, when people from our village meet guests, they must dress neatly, but here they only take off their hats when they meet people. The same is true of books and writings. Our characters are formed by dots and strokes, and then there is sound. They have strokes first, and then characters, which are formed by hooks, strokes, rows, and horizontal views. Our paintings do not take likeness, nor do they fall into clichés, which is called Shenyi. They use hard work in yin and yang, back and forth, likeness, and clichés. That is the inscription. Ours is written at the top, and theirs at the bottom. The use of brushes is also different, and it is often like this, which cannot be fully described.

"Li Yishan often sighed that he hated that he could not fulfill his life in Kyushu, and wrote a poem: 'I have only heard of nine more states overseas. I cannot predict the next life in this life.' As I was about to arrive, the boatmen pointed their fingers, and then I knew that the ninth point of Aogingluo in Li's poem was only a short distance away. The front waves flew over and could not rush people. Looking at it from the boat, the sea atmosphere was slightly misty, or it appeared suddenly, like a floating gull.

"Hao has no fields, only stone sand, and the soil is very barren. The residents do not know about spring plowing, and many are merchants; they do not plant mulberry trees, and women do not know about silkworm farming. They cover their whole bodies with red and purple brocade, slightly revealing half of their eyebrows and eyes; those in mourning wear black. The men have curly hair over their shoulders and wear hats like bamboo hats, which they remove when they see people; they wear short wool coats with very narrow sleeves. The middle of the clothes has buttons all around, and they wear leather clogs with only one tooth. Two swords, one long and one short, are worn horizontally at the waist, and those who hold rattan branches are officials."

Wu Mojing was one of the six great painters in the early Qing Dynasty. He studied with Wang Hui and Shigu. Later, he fled to Macau to avoid Wang Hui's persecution and spent the rest of his life there. According to the three excerpts above, his impression of Macau shows how much interest was aroused by the surprises of different customs at the time. But now, in our view, there is nothing strange about it. As for my view of Macau, it is that such a dirty and unlikeable city still owns a lot of Chinese investment.

### A Record of Yang Liaogong of Yun Jian

— Yun Sheng

Mr. Yang Liaogong, a famous scholar from Jian, was unrestrained and refined, transcending worldly affairs. He was also generous and concerned about public affairs, which is rare in modern times. In the winter of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), at the age of sixty-three, Mr. Yang accepted the invitation of the Chairman of Jiangsu Province to govern a county in Pudong, Shanghai. From the moment he took office, he advocated local autonomy, and all personnel and administrative decisions were based on public opinion. He first created a public newspaper, opened up public discourse, built land and water transportation, used public labor without exhausting public finances, and resolved disputes, bringing peace to the whole county. Mr. Yang was fond of personally visiting the people to understand their hardships. Sometimes he would enter teahouses to talk with the people. No matter how big or small the matter, he would learn the truth, and then write proclamations to post in public places, explaining things himself, which amazed the people. He banned smoking and gambling, starting with the gentry, not the common people. His personal example transformed the customs of the people. He did not seek personal gain during his three months in office.

At that time, I was teaching in Shanghai. During the winter vacation, I returned to my province and paid my respects to Mr. Yang at the Minglun Hall of the county government as a student. Upon entering his room, I saw Mr. Yang writing a poem: "This year's New Year's Eve debts are especially high, but I haven't made a sound. What can I do? After managing and sending away the god of poverty, I will have a comfortable home next year." He put down his pen, looked at me, and smiled, and asked if I had money to buy a pound of honey dates to treat guests. It turned out that Mr. Yang liked sweets. I happened to have brought new Huizhou tribute dates. Then he handed me a piece of paper and said, "Go back and read it with your father. Don't look at it first." When I looked at it with my father, it said, "Please resign your position, and I will do the same." Mr. Yang resigned on the day of the Lunar New Year after three months in office. The county government staff had a tradition of paying New Year's greetings. In the midst of the excitement, Mr. Yang quietly left.

Mr. Yang began to call himself Liaogong in middle age, meaning "I am done with public affairs." Mr. Yang came from a prominent family in Yun Jian and owned dozens of hectares of land. Because of his "Liaogong" intentions, he sold them all. I remember that in a certain year, there was a flood in seven provinces. Zhu Ziqiao wrote to Mr. Yang, saying that he urgently needed funds. So, he pawned a hundred hectares of land to help him. Mr. Yang did good deeds throughout his life. The result was the Songjiang Orphanage, which he founded. Today, some of the orphans in the orphanage have graduated from university. In his later years, he lived in the Zhu residence on Ximen Road, Sanqing Lane, Shanghai, selling books for a living and enjoying himself. He wrote a self-eulogy: "Family tyrant, social public figure," which suggests that a clean official cannot be both.

### Overseas Short Broadcasts

— Dongfang Jing

President Truman revealed some news about Stalin's health in early June. Mr. Stalin's health is poor, so he cannot visit the United States. He is not suitable for air travel. Getting on a plane causes him to have ringing in his ears and his heart is uncomfortable.

The US President has twice invited Stalin to visit the US for a "social visit." The first invitation was in July last year, when the Berlin Conference was coming to an end. The first time was at the Foreign Ministers' Conference last month, when Byrnes told Molotov. Both times, Stalin declined due to ill health.

President Truman is preparing to donate his collection of small war trophies to the West Point Military Academy Museum. At the same time, he enjoys showing his collection of small trinkets to his visitors, especially a Japanese katana sword, with two daggers on the scabbard, which are relics from the 17th century.

The housing shortage in the UK is also very serious. The general public is quite dissatisfied with the government's speed in building houses. Although the government has decided to build 500,000 houses every year, which is much more than the 360,000 before the war, it will still take five years to complete the 2.5 million houses needed.

According to the experience of travelers in Rome, the black market meal prices have decreased by 50% in the past two months. One reason is the increase in overseas food imports, and the second is that domestic vegetable gardens have products on the market. Currently, a sumptuous meal costs about four US dollars.

The competition among American filmmakers for the filming rights to "The Roosevelt Story" was extremely fierce, but recently all parties seem to have stopped fighting and temporarily given up because they cannot find a suitable actor to play Roosevelt.

Three thousand American soldiers were transferred to Berlin at the beginning of this month, and the black market price of cigarettes plummeted from 1,600 marks (equivalent to 160 US dollars) per carton to 1,200 marks because American G.I.s released a large number of cigarettes.

On the shore of Lake Zurich in Switzerland, there is a school that is sometimes called a "Humanity School." It is an oasis in the desert-like European education world. There are forty students here, learning the courses of reason and tolerance. The principal of the school is a 75-year-old German educator. It was originally located in the Black Forest in Germany, but was moved to Switzerland after the Nazis came to power.

Chaplin has not made a film in six years. The film he is about to make is called "The Murderer's Comedy," which is about the deeds of the French Bluebeard.

### Help Yourself, Help Others

Cholera is prevalent, and the death rate has been increasing in recent days. Even without the threat of this "tiger," environmental hygiene is especially important in the summer. Here, we need to overcome the selfish notion of "sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door." We would like to put forward the slogan "Help yourself, help others."

Here are four photographs. The two above are of events that happened in Shanghai: the City God Temple, where sewage has accumulated for eight years, causing a foul odor in the summer. The people in the neighborhood specially negotiated with the Nanshi and Beiqu Fire Brigade to work day and night to pump out the water, and now the entire Release Pond has been cleared. (Photographed by Shuo, our newspaper)

The two below are of events that happened abroad: "Vienna Youth Helping to Clean Streets" and "Residents of Holland, Michigan, USA, Cleaning Streets." (Special supply from the New York Times)

After you have seen these four pictures, take a look at your own surroundings. What should you do?

News Snippets

### Traitors in Prison Have American Sunglasses

Zhang Lianfang, known as the "Hardware King," was brought to trial for the first time by the High Court on the seventh of this month. A reporter from his newspaper went to take pictures. After taking the pictures and when he was leaving the court, his family members followed behind, firmly requesting that he not publish the photos and enticing him by saying, "As long as you agree, you can accept any conditions we offer." It can be seen that Zhang has more than just "hardware"; he also has a lot of "money."

During the High Court's trial of traitors, the famous traitors often maintained their composure when answering questions. For example, the president of the puppet High Court often used the phrase "I'll tell you" in his answers. Xie Baosheng and Zhou Bangjun did not say "defendant" but referred to themselves as "Baosheng" and "Bangjun." Even more so, some traitors still used absurd arguments such as "The Greater East Asia War" and "The Chongqing Regime." It can be seen that their traitorous hearts have not died! Chang Yuqing, the "Anqing Society" leader, who was "famous" in Beijing and Shanghai for murdering patriotic people, absolutely denied it during the trial. Only when the judge said, "Liang Hongzhi also admitted that you did it," was he speechless and unable to argue. After Chang returned to prison, he became estranged from Liang and blamed him for "dragging people down," disregarding their reputations, and a big quarrel broke out. Afterwards, the devil was still concerned about this and was "always unhappy."

Liang Hongzhi was the leader of the "Reformed Government," and Chang Yuqing was the head of the "Huangdao Society." One was a traitor, and the other was a murderer. Both were special figures of the "former Han." According to observations from all sides, it is predicted that these two traitors may be the first to be sentenced to death.

There are no less than two hundred traitors currently imprisoned in the Shanghai prison. Family members visit twice a week to bring them things. All kinds of food, supplies, and clothing are available. Recently, the latest American glass sunglasses have also been found in the prison. It can be seen that the traitors have not forgotten to be "modern" even in prison. As for food, there is no shortage of fruit and Western pastries. Whether the traitors have "good appetites" or "good taste" is puzzling.

Zeng Zhongming, who responded to Wang Jingwei's telegram by expressing his support, was assassinated in Hanoi at the time, so it is unclear whether he is a traitor, and his identity is unclear. Therefore, his house in Nanjing has become an "unsolved case." Zeng had many properties in the capital in the past. In Xuanwu Lake alone, there were eight very exquisite Western-style houses. There were also more than ten Western-style houses in Cuiming Village. The buildings are very luxurious. The senior staff of the former Army Headquarters and the Capital Police Department are currently renting the houses from the Nanjing Municipal Government on a temporary basis, and the rents are very low. Recently, someone has expressed "keen concern" about "what identity should Zeng be classified as" and has submitted it to the Capital High Court for research. Although Zeng is dead, his property is still there and is worth thinking about.

### The Tragedy of Old Master [Novel] (Part 2)

— Tian Qin

After quite some time, Fourth Generation returned with all the things his father had told him to buy. He hadn't even spent half the money. The remaining pile of copper coins clattered onto the bed. Old Master, without a word, put down his pipe, picked up the wine jug, and drank straight from the spout. Then, one by one, he tossed blue soybeans into his mouth like shooting baskets, making a "ge ba, ge ba" sound.

Fourth Generation squatted on the ground, taking large bites of his sesame cake wrapped with fried dough sticks. Neither father nor son said anything. Each greedily enjoyed their share.

Finally, Fourth Generation blurted out: "Dad! Today, it feels like we're celebrating the New Year. ......"

That was the end of their day.

The result of the civil war bankrupted the countryside, and coupled with years of great disasters, made it even more impossible for this old man and his young son to survive in their hometown!

Old Master hated people who "ran to the sea" (went to the city to seek their fortune) more than anything. However, when the whip of life lashed at his own back, he couldn't help but tread the path he hated most!

Both father and son were kind farmers who had never left their home. Except for going to the market or temple fairs, they had never even seen the county seat. This pair of farmers who were reluctant to leave home now actually stepped into the city and completely changed their profession.

Fourth Generation, relying on the little skills he had learned in the countryside, even joined a troupe and started acting in plays. And their lives really improved a lot.

Just look at Old Master: he was no longer wearing short clothes, but long gowns and mandarin jackets. He was no longer smoking a pipe, but medium-grade foreign cigarettes. And he broke precedent by marrying a Beijing woman with big feet as his wife. Although she was already in her early forties and not very beautiful, city people are city people. She was generous, knew how to talk, and spoke fluent Mandarin, which was much better than his late wife. However, Old Master always felt that her feet were too big, and he was afraid that the villagers would laugh at him when he returned home. Although he had been mixing in the city for quite some time, his standards for marrying a wife had not changed. He still believed that small feet, a white face, black hair, and big eyes were the most standard.

Actually, Old Master didn't dislike his old wife simply because of her big feet. Otherwise, why would she have gotten pregnant so soon after he brought her over!

Although Fourth Generation was now a second-rate martial arts actor in the troupe, his monthly salary was quite good. Apart from expenses, the family of three had a surplus every month. One would think they should be content. However, after arriving in the city, Fourth Generation's horizons widened and his mind became more complex. When he had nothing to do, he often daydreamed, always thinking that relying on this profession for the rest of his life was not a good idea. Although it could solve their livelihood, it was ultimately a despised occupation. He often thought about getting an official position, how impressive it would be to wear a golden-hooped hat. Sometimes, when the family was bored, he would reveal a little of his ambition. Old Master didn't object to his idea. Why wouldn't he want to be a real "Old Master" himself? As for the stepmother, she had nothing to say. Old Master was the head of the family, and if he didn't object to something, it would definitely work out.

However, although Old Master didn't object, he was somewhat nostalgic for their current life. Being an official was certainly good, but without connections, how could it be easy?

The soldiers with the small white flags of "recruiting new soldiers" were everywhere in the alleyways. However, he couldn't start by becoming a soldier. Being a soldier meant fighting wars, and fighting wars every year. Bullets have no eyes. If he had bad luck and died in battle, he wouldn't have become an official and would have lost his life instead. That wouldn't be worth it. Moreover, it was people fighting against their own people. What sense did that make?

Naturally, Fourth Generation had no such plans. He wasn't the kind of unreasonable child who would just do it and immediately abandon the lives of the two elders and run away. He was just thinking and also trying to find such a path, one that wouldn't interfere with the family's livelihood before he dared to change professions.

Although acting was a lowly profession in those years, some dignitaries liked to associate with such people, especially the concubines, who especially liked the pretty-boy actors. This reason was quite puzzling.

Fourth Generation's years of acting had actually allowed him to get to know many such figures, which had a great impact on his later development.

Old Master was really ruthless. If he wasn't going to "run to the sea", he wouldn't go. But once he went, it was for more than a decade. Although there was nothing left for him to miss in his hometown, he still returned to his native land. In fact, he had already sold the only small, dilapidated house a long time ago. He didn't even have a place to live when he came back. What was he coming back for?

In Old Master's mind, it was nothing more than to show off to his fellow villagers, because this time he really became an Old Master. To put it nicely, "all rivers flow to the sea" is also human nature. In any case, Old Master's triumphant return was an undeniable fact.

Old Master's arrival caused a sensation in the whole village. It's no wonder, villagers had never seen such a scene. Just the camphor wood trunks alone numbered several, and they were very heavy. In fact, maybe they were filled with torn clothes and rags, but the villagers saw that the porters were struggling so hard, they were sure that they were filled with coins with Yuan Shikai's head on them. So, it spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, that Old Wu (a nickname) was back home rich. Some people started making wild guesses!

Cross-eyed Bian said to Big Sister-in-law: "Hmph, he must have become a bandit. Otherwise, how could he have made such a fortune? Besides drinking and bragging, what skills does he have!"

Second Aunt Fu agreed with her:

"That's right, look, he even snatched a Beijing woman. If he hadn't snatched her, who would marry him, this poor boy!"

"That's right, I bet this woman must be a widow, very rich, just living with this young son. There's no one to help at home, so the old rascal took advantage of the situation and robbed her of both the person and the money. There's nowhere else to hide, so they had to come back home. That must be the case." Baldy's wife chimed in. Unexpectedly, Baldy was coming from behind, and these gossips filled his ears. He was furious, took a quick step, grabbed her hair, and kicked her a few times.

"Damn you, you talk too much, aren't you afraid of causing trouble..." Baldy's wife was crying and wailing as the people who were mediating pulled her away. Naturally, Baldy couldn't pursue her anymore. In this way, the gossip group disbanded.

Old Master ordered people to carry the luggage ashore, then carried his four- or five-year-old second son and got off the boat. Old Master's wife followed closely behind him.

After Old Master got off the boat, the boatman asked again:

"Where are you old folks moving to?"

This question stumped our Old Master. Yes, where should they move to? He didn't even have a home. His face flushed, especially with his wife staring at him with her two eyes, he felt even more embarrassed.

People are, after all, "blessed with inspiration". He thought for a while, "Let's move to Second Master's house."

Who is Second Master? Of course, the boatman didn't know. He didn't know which street or which alley he lived on. Anyway, with Old Master leading the way, he wouldn't go wrong.

After the luggage was moved to Second Old Master's house, they finally settled down.

It's also necessary to introduce Second Old Master. Second Old Master was Old Master's cousin. They had separated their families a long time ago. Second Old Master was quite wealthy, and his family wasn't large. He could be said to be living well in the countryside, so he wasn't interested in the arrival of Old Master's uninvited guests, even though he had returned in triumph. In addition, Second Old Master's wife couldn't get rid of the stinginess of country people. They were eating and drinking as soon as they entered the door, and she was simply eight hundred and twenty times unhappy.

Old Master lost his temper once again on the first day he arrived home. He happened to meet Xi Shun, who was selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, on the street. He was the first to spot Old Master.

"Uncle Old Wu! How are you..."

Old Master was furious when he heard someone call him by his childhood name. He straightened his neck, bulged his eyes, and started to scold him.

"You little bastard? You're so ungrateful. I'm an Old Master now, do you know that? How dare you call me by my childhood name, it's outrageous. Let me tell you, I... I... when I... was in... Jiang... Xi... even the division commanders... had to call... me... Old... Master..."

The more he scolded, the angrier he became, and the more angry he was, the more incoherent he became. Then he pounced on Xi Shun and slapped him. He stumbled, the basket tilted, and sesame cakes and fried dough sticks fell all over the ground. "Ha, ha, ha..."

The onlookers all laughed. Of course, there were still people trying to break it up. Xi Shun didn't back down. While picking up the sesame cakes and fried dough sticks that had fallen on the ground, he also cursed:

"Tiger's tail!" Here, he simply dropped the "Uncle" part altogether. "Xi Shun, forget it." An old man carrying a manure basket advised. After pulling him to the side, he turned around and said to Old Master:

"Old..., Gan Quan! For my sake, don't argue with him. He's young, it's not worth it..."

"Listen to him, the little bastard. He dares to call me by my childhood name..."

"You motherfucking hundred little bastards! You're calling yourself a motherfucking Old Master, who's Old Master are you? You're pretending to be something you're not. How many days have you been wearing pants with crotches? Pay me back, do you remember you still owe me three sets of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks..."

Neither of them would give in. They only didn't fight because someone was trying to mediate!

In the end, Old Master's wife pulled him away.

"Let's go home, aren't you afraid of losing your status arguing with him!"

Old Master felt that his wife's opinion was right when he heard the word "status", so he returned to Second Old Master's house. Xi Shun, seeing that he had left, naturally wasn't angry anymore. Although the sesame cakes had fallen to the ground, there wasn't really any loss. Except for getting a little dirty, they could still be sold for money. Besides, it wasn't for him to eat, so who cared.

"Status?......" Xi Shun heard these two words and felt a little nauseous, he chuckled and walked out of the crowd with his basket. He yelled.

"Sesame cakes and fried dough sticks!"

Second Master and Second Madam seemed to take a laissez-faire attitude towards this matter. Second Master thought that Shou Gen and Fa Chang were both pretty good. Although Fa Chang was more pleasing, he wasn't necessarily going to marry A Dong to Fa Chang. Second Madam simply didn't have time to think about such trivial matters. She was an optimist. When she was happy, she would laugh a lot and lie on the bed and smoke a few pipes of opium, sleeping comfortably. When she was unhappy, she would scold the servants and maids, lie on the bed and smoke a few pipes of opium, and still sleep comfortably.

However, this was not a trivial matter for Chen Family Aunt, Shou Gen's mother. We must understand that for a widow who has only one son after the death of her husband, economic hardship is a matter of course, and at the same time, the desire to have a grandson occupies the most important place in her heart. Even in the countryside, marrying a wife through a proper match requires a considerable expense, and her clear eyes have long placed her hopes for the rest of her life on A Dong. However, if the current situation continues to develop, won't the good dream she has worked so hard to weave be completely shattered?

So she was looking forward to the arrival of Mother He Dong.

Mother He Dong was an outstanding matchmaker, an indispensable figure in the village and town. She was attentive, knew how to talk, was good at smiling, and was quick with her hands and feet. Although she came from a humble background, she could enter and exit various wealthy families and gain the welcome of everyone from top to bottom. She occasionally brought some gifts over, such as two small chicks or half a jar of pickles. When she went home, the basket was always heavier than when she left. The setting sun painted her face red, and her heart was particularly light.

On this day, Mother He Dong arrived, and Chen Family Aunt received her with extra care, brewing tea three times in a row. Mother He Dong was curious, but she didn't want to ask first, so she pretended to be nonchalant and talked at length about the happy event of the Huang family in town the day before yesterday: the bride was pretty, but there were more freckles and blemishes on her face; the master and madam often quarreled, the madam was a showy person who liked to give more money to the people below, but the master always wanted to deduct some, saying that spending money was like scraping water, save as much as you can, ... while exploring Chen Family Aunt's facial expressions, she was surprised at the other party's patience. Fortunately, in the end, Chen Family Aunt finally opened her mouth timidly.

"Mother, to be honest with you, I have something on my mind that I want to ask you for help with."

"Just tell me, if my old body can do anything, I will definitely help you." Mother He Dong immediately catered to her.

"It's also a marriage matter, our Shou Gen is old enough."

"Yes, it's time to get a wife. Fortunately, Shou Gen is an honest and steady person, otherwise, at this age, he would have been sniffing and drilling around like a mad dog. - Who do you have your eye on? I'll go talk to them for you."

"Mother, you are a discerning person, you can see everything clearly, I don't need to say it."

"I really don't know."

"A Dong in Second Master's house, who else?"

"Oh——" Mother finally couldn't help but giggle; "This... it would be proper... for you to tell Second Master and Madam, and it would be done."

"How can I say it myself, and besides -" she paused, and then told her her difficulties one by one. Mother He Dong was an extremely good person, so she naturally agreed readily.

The onlookers naturally dispersed as well. However, with such a commotion, the countryside had talking points.

June in the countryside is sweltering. In the evening, after finishing dinner, everyone has nothing to do. They sit on the roof in groups of three or five, enjoying the cool air, bare-backed, fanning themselves with palm-leaf fans, chatting about anything and everything.

Old Master had made so many jokes on the first day he arrived home, so of course, the topic of conversation for those enjoying the cool air focused on this aspect.

It happened to be the fifteenth of the month, the bright moon hung in the sky, and there wasn't a cloud in sight. The moon goddess seemed especially bright, almost like daytime.

Old Master's family and Second Old Master's family also went to the roof to enjoy the cool air. There were also a few people who came to visit, they all wanted to get more news from Old Master.

Old Master was holding up two photos as if to show everyone. One was a family portrait. Old Master and his wife were sitting in the front, the little son born to the Beijing woman was standing next to them, and a young couple was standing in the back. The man was fully armed, the woman was wearing a long cheongsam, with short hair, and holding a small boy who couldn't walk yet. This young couple was Fourth Generation and his wife, and the small boy who couldn't walk was Old Master's little grandson. This was a genuine three-generation family. The other photo was a solo portrait of Fourth Generation in full uniform, wearing a golden-brimmed hat and carrying a foreign sword. He really looked like a soldier. He was now a squad leader. At most, his rank was a captain. However, Old Master, who came from a peasant background, thought it was amazing to have such a good son, a son who had become an official.

Old Master, with an arrogant expression on his face, passed the photos around for everyone to see.

"××! Our Fourth... Fourth Generation... is really... promising, he's now promoted to squad leader... When we were in... Jiangxi... the house even had... orderlies... serving us... He had to... call... call me... me Old Master, Brother, I'm a big... big man now, you... you're just... Second... Second Master..."

Others just hummed and hawed, listening to him brag alone. Second Master wasn't interested in his words. He could somewhat see through him, so he turned to a few people who came to visit and bragged.

"Fourth Generation is a child with... with popularity, their... division commander likes... him the most, so he considered him his godson... You think, how fast would the division commander's godson... be promoted? As the saying goes, it's easy to be an official if you have someone in the court, wouldn't it be easy to become a regimental commander in the future? When... when our Fourth Generation becomes... a brigade commander... we'll repair the Bodhisattva temple in our village first... this... this... this is the feng shui of our village... Don't you think so?"

"Yes!" The people who came to visit echoed Old Master with a "yes".

"Look, I'm an official too." Old Master's little son was wearing his brother's golden-brimmed hat and yelling to everyone while waving his arms. This was all taught by Old Master and his wife. Originally, the little child didn't want to wear the military hat in the hot weather, but in order to publicize that Fourth Generation was really a military officer, they forced the child to wear it and show it off to the villagers.

"Good boy, put it on, Dad will buy you candy tomorrow..." Old Master told his son privately, so that's how it was done. So his little son wore that golden-brimmed hat everywhere he played.

"Don't jump around, you'll collapse your second uncle's house! This child!" When the little son was doing his duty for his father, the Beijing woman showed off her mother's authority and solemnly taught her little son a lesson.

"You're really a dog with horns, meddling in other people's business. If the child... is happy playing, what... what's it to you?... If... the house collapses; we'll build a new one... we have plenty."

Old Master showed off his power to his wife. Fortunately, his wife didn't respond, so this small disturbance passed, but as a result, the air was silent for a while.

The people who came to visit, dragging their tired bodies, went home to sleep.

"You guys take a rest for a while longer, Big Brother, we're going to sleep, we have things to do tomorrow..." Second Old Master and his wife were polite enough to say these few words, but without waiting for Old Master to respond, they climbed the ladder and went down to the house.

The three members of Old Master's family felt that there was no one to brag to anymore, and they also felt very bored, so they went down to the house to sleep.

In less than half a month after Old Master returned home, the whole village had a bad impression of him. It's no wonder, he would get drunk and scold people all day long, and he would put on the airs of an Old Master whenever he saw someone. Country people have such a strange temper, you have money and power, that's yours, they won't flatter you.

In June three years later, although Fourth Generation had gone through several more civil wars, he still hadn't been promoted to brigade commander. He was still a squad leader, and he had been injured once in a major battle, but fortunately, he hadn't lost his life.

At noon, the streets were quiet. The sun was burning the earth like poisonous fire. People were hiding in the shade to avoid the heat. Wild dogs stuck out their long tongues and panted. Several children were naked, leaning on the sun-scorched stone steps. They looked like they had just returned from swimming in the river, and their bodies were still covered in water that hadn't dried, intending to dry it on the stone steps.

This village is surrounded by water, so all the seven or eight-year-old children living here know how to swim, otherwise the adults wouldn't feel at ease.

Suddenly, a burst of crying came from the edge of the village, so miserable. The sound of crying didn't sound like a local dialect, it was a woman's crying. After a while, the faint crying of a man was also heard. The children covered their ears with their small hands.

"Listen!" The bigger one said "Listen", and the other children quietly pricked up their ears. "I bet Old Wu's little son drowned!" Little Runaway said.

"That's right, he hasn't learned how to swim yet, but he's floating (phonetic reading) in the deep water, so how could he not drown!"

"The adults all say that there are ghosts in the river at noon, he must have been pulled down by a ghost."

"Then we shouldn't go swimming at noon in the future..."

The children's guess was indeed correct. The one who died was really Old Master's little son. The naked little corpse was lying under the shade of a tree by the river. The Beijing woman was crying to death on the corpse, and Old Master's tears were also streaming down. Naturally, there were people watching the commotion, and there were also people trying to comfort him.

Immediately afterwards, the mothers of each family were running under the sun, calling out their sons' childhood names, because the village was rumored to have drowned a child, and they hadn't seen their sons for a long time, so they couldn't calm down.

The children all crowded around the corpse to watch the commotion. The shouting sounds were sometimes clear and sometimes unclear. Some children even ignored their mothers calling them. When their mothers came up to them, they grabbed them and beat and scolded them without saying a word.

"You little bastard, I've been calling you for a long time and you don't answer, are you deaf, are you dumb..." Then they slapped them a few times, and the child cried.

"Go back quickly, don't you dare come out to swim at noon again..."

Old Master cried for a long time, but he couldn't bring his son back to life. He asked someone to buy a wooden box and bury him.

The couple's eyes were straight and red for several days, and they didn't eat for several days, but Old Master hadn't stopped drinking. Moreover, he drank even more than usual.

After the little son died, they didn't receive a letter from the eldest son for many days, and they were really worried. It just so happened that another civil war had started in Jiangxi, and if something unexpected happened, Old Master's life would immediately have problems. He hung his head and was always thinking. The Beijing woman was also plunged into extreme pain.

Misfortunes never come singly. The son wrote a letter saying that the little grandson had also died because of smallpox. Although he didn't get injured in this battle, this battle was just the beginning, and it wouldn't be over for a while.

Finally, he also advised his father a few words, saying that he should treat people kindly everywhere in his hometown, and that his official position was nothing, and he should never say that we are officials and even bully the villagers. These things must never be done!

After Old Master asked someone to read the letter to him, he was very unhappy. Not only did the letter not send any money, but it also brought bad news. In the end, he even lectured his father. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and he simply jumped up and started cursing. "You little bastard, you're lecturing your father now that you're an official. Tomorrow, I'm going to... give... our... our... In-law × Division Commander write a letter... Tell him... to discipline him... properly..."

He was half angry and half showing off his background to the person who read the letter to him.

In-law with the division commander, that's amazing.

The following year, Old Master's luck was even worse! He hadn't received the pension after his eldest son died in battle, and the widowed daughter-in-law was also missing.

The little savings in his hand had long been spent. The few camphor wood trunks he had brought back home were unconditionally given to Second Old Master, but now he didn't admit it. He forced him to pay him five yuan, saying that he hadn't given it to him. Fortunately, Second Old Master had plenty of money. Giving you five yuan didn't matter much, anyway, the trunk was his now.

However, because of the trunk problem, Second Old Master forced him to move out. He rented a small, dilapidated house in Henan to live in. Now, only the two elderly people were left, so of course, he didn't dare to resist.

However, after he moved out, he kept talking about how the old generation's family separation was unclear, and we have to re-separate. If Second Old Master doesn't agree, I'll call our in-law × Division Commander... write... write a letter... to... the county magistrate...

That's what he said, but he never dared to provoke them again. After selling all his things, although he was nearly sixty years old, he still had to go back to his old profession - farming and fishing. That's called finding it where you lost it. What you do is what you'll always do.

The Beijing woman went door-to-door begging for tears every day. Although life was so hard, they still struggled on day by day, year by year.

Although the small, dilapidated house was empty on all four walls, the two photos were still pasted on the wall. The golden-edged door was hung at the entrance, and below it was a portrait of the Kitchen God, the head of the family.

Struggling, struggling, after all, he was old and his body couldn't hold on.

Finally, in his sixty-second year, he fell ill and died. When he was about to breathe his last, he was lying on the door panel and still calling × Division Commander, × In-law...

The Beijing woman stayed by the corpse bed, and old tears couldn't come out anymore...

35, 6, 9. In Chongqing.

Legal Queries

(1) Peng Jinchen asks: Zhou, nearing forty and still without offspring, has long harbored the desire to take a concubine. His wife has familial ties with my family. In order to achieve his ambition of currying favor with officials, he disregards his self-worth and repeatedly entices my younger sister. My sister is only eighteen, has a weak will, and is blinded by profit, ultimately tacitly agreeing. The other party presses forward rapidly, suddenly proposing marriage. Despite repeated dissuasion, my sister turns a deaf ear to sound advice. I lost my parents young, a lifelong regret, and how could I bear to see my sister ruin herself! I respectfully ask your lawyer to answer: (1) Is there a sound method to resolve this matter? (2) If unavoidable, can I, as her legal representative, sue the other party for attempting to incite a minor to leave her family, and demand compensation for reputational damage?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] If your sister is of age and it is her own free will, there is nothing that can be done. Otherwise, it can be handled according to the article on leaving one's family. (2) Zhenjiang Xu Yanqiu asks: I am a long-time friend of your paper. Seeing the Social Services column, I deeply admire your lawyer for answering the public's difficult questions. In the second year of the Republic, I rented two storefronts from the Jinshan Temple property to run a business. In the twenty-sixth year, when the enemy invaded Zhenjiang, troops were stationed near my business location, searching passing pedestrians, making it impossible to operate. Since the victory, everything has been in the process of recovery. I recently wanted to resume my business, but the landlord is demanding rent for the eight years since, and wants it calculated in silver dollars. In those years, the monthly rent for the two storefronts was four yuan, totaling about 400 silver dollars. Given the current exchange rate for silver, this would amount to 400,000 legal tender. Despite multiple mediations, no agreement has been reached. I ask, concerning the eight years of rent owed, what kind of

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] Regarding the standard for increasing rent, according to Shanghai municipal regulations, starting from December of the 34th year of the Republic, city housing is calculated at sixty times the rent of August of the 26th year. From April of this year, it is calculated at one hundred and sixty times the rent of August of the 26th year. However, whether this applies to Zhenjiang needs to be investigated based on local conditions. As for the eight years of unpaid rent, there is no way to convert it into legal tender using the current silver dollar exchange rate.

### The Harms of Singleness

— Wen Yi

Marriage has a beneficial impact on life in both tangible and intangible ways. According to surveys in various countries on the presence of a spouse and mortality rates, married men and women consistently have lower mortality rates than unmarried or single individuals of the same age.

Why is it that people with spouses have lower mortality rates than single individuals (including widowers and divorcées)? Firstly, for women, entering married life can eliminate the dangers of survival and competition that are inevitable for those without spouses. Secondly, a woman's body is able to fulfill the natural duty of bearing children, which is in line with the process of evolution and development. If one does not conceive or give birth, it is a life that goes against nature, and this will naturally have an adverse impact on health.

As for men, they rush around from morning to night for work, becoming exhausted in the process. They rely on returning home to rest their minds and restore their health. If there is a wise wife at home to provide comfort, this is more effective than any medicine in nurturing vitality. Without a spouse, one lacks this most important protector and cannot obtain this comfort. Furthermore, those who lose the joy of family reunion, unwilling to be lonely, will go to teahouses and wine shops for entertainment, losing their spirits at best and descending into depravity at worst, which will also greatly affect their health.

On the other hand, singleness goes against the national interest. Therefore, I say that single individuals are the sinners of the nation.

### Farm Girls of Guizhou

— Yi Ming

The eastern clouds, adorned with vivid purplish-brown hues, slowly spread from the gloomy sky. The sun hides behind them, primping; the sparrows in the bamboo forest are still having their sweet dreams; the mountain country girls have already climbed out of their cave-like rooms, groped to put on their clothes, tightly bound their foot-binding cloths, slipped into their five-inch pointed shoes, pushed open the kitchen door, scooped up a large basin of water to wash their faces. With white cloth head wraps neatly folded into half-inch-wide bands on their heads, braids already prepared the night before for sleeping, bags of cyan or white cloth filled with needles and thread in their arms, carrying baskets on their backs, and sickles in their hands, they call out to their sisters up and down the slopes, setting off together to gather pigweed. When tired, they sit down on the mud benches by the fields, take out their work from their arms—embroidering pillowcases, stitching shoe uppers, talking about how skillful Zhang's daughter is, having completed so much needlework, how Li's younger sister has embroidered so many pillows, and how Wang's elder sister is truly suffering, not even having a pair of shoes before getting married. This is during the agricultural off-season.

Around Qingming, the small season for sowing begins, scattering corn and planting beans. Such vast mountainside fields cannot be worked by a single pair of hands and feet. The girls with their braided hair and bound feet have to carry needlework to exchange labor with other families.

The shouts of "Harvesting wheat and transplanting rice" echo, harmonizing with the songs of transplanting rice in the paddies. The girls with their tightly bound feet come and go between the kitchen and the stove, grinding soybean curd, selecting vegetables, preparing meals for a dozen people, as well as food for the piglets, and leading the cattle to the river gullies to drink water.

When the golden rice ears droop in the fields, the farmers seem like oxen unyoked from the plow, happily smiling. The girls also follow the cheers, dropping their needlework and busying themselves with threshing and drying the grain.

The cold winter follows immediately after the autumn harvest. Farm work comes to a temporary halt. In these three winter months, the girls must prepare fuel for the following spring. They invite their companions, carrying sickles and hemp ropes, to the landlord's forest to gather fallen branches blown down by the wind.

Upon returning home at night, they stretch their feet into the ash pit to warm their stiff, frozen feet with the remaining embers, comb their braids, pick up a unburnt embers, and take it to the bed to sleep.

### The Life of Ladies from Old Families

Living in homes with black lacquered gates hanging with gold-lettered signs that read "Official Residence" or "Jinshi Residence," with screens erected in the courtyards and beaded curtains hanging down, these girls came from distinguished families of generations of scholars. They, too, saw the colorful clouds walking ahead of the sun in the east, and they, too, woke up earlier than the sparrows under the eaves. After combing their hair, putting on their shoes properly, and sweeping and cleaning the house, they would first perform the work of "early rising with three cleans: hair clean, feet clean, and ground clean." Walking to the kitchen, they would learn to cook from the family members. When they had free time, they would sit in their rooms and learn embroidery. If a close female guest came, they would respectfully come out to pour a cup of tea, fill a pipe with tobacco, and then retreat back into their room in an orderly manner.

Society, like a peep show, is constantly renewing its patterns. The parents, who pride themselves on their old traditions, do not want their daughters to fall behind. They hire experienced and respected old teachers to teach at home. Thus, after meals, the girls from these distinguished old families also sit in the study and read books with a murmur. They are taught by their parents that only the ability to write letters and keep accounts is necessary. Books like *The Romance of the Western Chamber* and *Dream of the Red Chamber*, which are deemed obscene, should not only be avoided, but even mentioning them is considered embarrassing. Going to school is out of the question.

The roads, winding and twisting, are well built around the city. Monster-like cars with big eyes run faster than horses. The airport is endlessly wide, and the airplanes have to circle several times before they can fly. How beautiful! These news items also reach the ears of the girls from old families from the mouths of their fathers and brothers. But after all, they are daughters of noble families, so how can they show their faces in public to go and see.

People live in the courtyard, so how can you go to the middle hall? The patio is even more out of the question. There are girls who, from the age of thirteen or fourteen until they get married, have never even seen outsiders. These are truly families with good traditions.

### Daughter's Love Issues

— Wang Huanbai

Under the loving care of her mother, a girl grows up day by day. When she reaches a certain age and matures, she feels admiration for the opposite sex, and thus love issues easily arise. This issue is related to the happiness of a girl's entire life and is very serious. If you are a person who has been baptized by new ideas, you will of course agree with freedom of love and will never, as people of the past did, choose a marriage partner for her yourself. But if your daughter is only sixteen or seventeen years old now and is already having social interactions with her male classmates, then what attitude will you take?

Perhaps you think that your child is too young and should not be dating yet—well, I admit that you have keen insight, showing that you are a wise mother. However, when you severely scold your daughter and teach her to follow your wishes, I think you will mostly fail. Perhaps she will reverse her past gentleness and obedience and express dissatisfaction. Then, you will be a little sad and say that your child has "gone bad," so you desperately control her, not allowing her to step out of the house except to go to school or visit relatives. You think that doing so will probably achieve the desired goal, but I think you will still fail. She may be even more disobedient to your words, or she may obey outwardly but still be angry inwardly!

According to psychological theory, the best way is—you must never hurt your daughter's self-esteem. You must treat her love affair with due respect, and you must consider it from all angles in front of her. Do not use your maternal authority to subdue her, and then express your own ideas.

If you ignore your daughter's love issues, it is truly extremely dangerous! But you cannot just control her blindly. It is best to take an attitude of participating and offering advice.

### Save the Illegitimate Children

— Cheng Jun

The famous French novelist Guy de Maupassant, in his masterpiece "The Son Who Killed His Parents," narrates the story of an illegitimate child who, unable to bear the contempt of the world, killed his parents and then confessed in court, saying, "They sought pleasure for themselves and unintentionally gave birth to a child. They stubbornly suppressed this child, and unexpectedly it later fell to me to suppress them." Although this is a novel, is it not a reflection of reality?

The issue of illegitimate children has been around for thousands of years. There are already legal regulations for it, so logically it should be a non-issue. But the tragedy in Maupassant's novel is still visible everywhere. It is clear that this is no longer a problem that can be solved by law, but one that requires a new ethical and moral perspective to resolve.

First of all, we must save young men and women. They must have certain standards when dating and must be cautious. They must use reason to restrain the overflow of emotions. Otherwise, while the temporary emotional tide is satisfied, it sows the seeds of tragedy. In order to destroy this ambiguous evidence, they have to strangle the small individual. You think, is there anything more reckless or more cruel than this?

Therefore, in order to prevent the tragedy caused by illegitimate children, we sincerely request people to cherish the lives of young people and not waste them recklessly. Moreover, love is definitely not just physical satisfaction. In order to respect the personality of both men and women, it takes great perseverance to restrain emotions!

Secondly, if an illegitimate child is unfortunately produced, the parties involved should bravely come out and admit it. This is so that these innocent children can have their identities confirmed, and they must not be as selfish and cowardly as the parents in Maupassant's novel. Because this behavior is not a sin in itself, but only a little reckless. So why create this sin yourself, causing your conscience to be eternally condemned!

The general public in society should change their views on illegitimate children. "Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me." Know that thousands of illegitimate children are killed because of the fear of public opinion! Contempt and ridicule, these sharp blades, have killed thousands of lives. We cannot ignore this blood-stained fact and should no longer arbitrarily use this bloodless killing blade.

Children are innocent, so what does it matter if they are illegitimate or legitimate. After this great massacre, mankind has a high degree of awareness and is seeking lasting peace. For this tragic problem that has been around for thousands of years, I hope everyone will bring out their human conscience and no longer allow us to find these small lives abandoned in the great alleys and remote rural areas.

The baby in the picture above was born in Detroit, Michigan, USA, and is named Michael. Since he was two or three months old, he has liked to use his feet to hold things. However, his hands are also normal and used flexibly. Michael is now about eight months old. In the picture, he is demonstrating using his feet to hold a milk bottle.

### The Balance of Creation

— Yu Wen

Recently, I have read many literary works written by young friends and found that while their ideas are very correct, their forms cannot achieve perfection or come close to it. This reminds me of the issue of content and form in art.

Literary works are art. A good artistic creation must not only have good content but also a good form. We know that the process of artistic creation, in short, can be divided into two steps: the first is combining images, and the second is expressing images. Form is the image, and content is the consciousness contained in the image. All artistic creations that are rich in ideals and have vitality must have both rich content and perfect form.

That being said, artists cannot intentionally regard content and form as two completely different things during the creative process. They are originally unified and inseparable. The preface to the Book of Poetry says: "Poetry is where the will goes. In the heart it is the will; spoken it is poetry. Emotion moves within, and takes form in words..." The "emotion" that moves within and the "poetry" that takes form in words are originally one and two, and two and one. Therefore, we must pay attention to the "balance of creation."

What is the "balance of creation?" It is a work in which content and form are very harmonious and very unified. Such a work has achieved "balance" in terms of content and form, which means it is a good creation. Here, we will not discuss the troublesome issues that have long been debated in literature, such as whether form determines content or content determines form. We just want to think about a few words that Western philosophers have said:

-- Nothing is inside, nothing is outside.

Whatever is inside is also outside.

“Nichts ist drinnen, nichts ist draussen, denn was innen, das ist aussen”

These words fully illustrate a state of seamless integration when artistic creation achieves "balance." Friends who aspire to literary writing may wish to give them some thought.

### Today's "Li Sao" [Lament for Departure]

— Ying Feicun

(1)

Who has established a hell on earth?

Everywhere are feasts made from the fat of the people.

The demonic bandits cackle, monkeys leap, wolves devour, tigers are startled,

The lackeys cast flattering, hopeful glances—

Waiting for a single drop or a gnawed bone to leak from the demon's mouth,

Then they swarm, veins bulging, baring fangs, vying with each other.

The beauty, magic, light, and warmth of humanity have become ancient relics,

A foul and rank era proclaims a foul and rank morality—

Kindness is equated with incompetence, culture with ash!

The beast that can devour men is a hero and a champion!

(2)

In the bitter cold, I tightly hold onto a portion of truth, a grain of conscience,

Like a frail girl guarding her virginity against coercion and temptation.

But my purity invites the darkest slander from the lackeys,

My virtuous bones have no weight on the scales of the world.

Alas! Should I submit to becoming a slice of meat in the bowl?

Should I hunch my shoulders to become a dog at the table?

Should I defy my conscience to become a beast at the feast?

Like a fish in a drained pond, I cannot find a way out.

(3)

I picked up a book discarded like embers,

The lingering stains are the saliva of the lackeys' scorn.

My soul entered the world of lead type,

Like a lost wanderer in the wilderness throwing himself into the niche of a dilapidated temple.

Ah, here breathes the fragrance of Wen Tianxiang's righteousness,

Here shines the loyal soul of Shi Kefa at Plum Blossom Ridge,

Here echoes Xie Fuyu's indignant lament,

Here resounds Gu Tinglin's lesson of "a sense of shame,"

"I, old man, can still cross the great desert; how can you gentlemen weep at Xinting?"

It is Lu You's tragic roar!

All this invigorates my congealing blood,

I spit a mouthful of contempt at the contempt of the lackeys!

(4)

I stand firm, fist clenched, gazing at the dark midnight sky,

The flow of blood throughout my body is fiery warm and strong.

I will use justice to strike a spark in this hell,

To ignite the conscience of the slaves that has not yet become damp and moldy;

Tell the demonic bandits and lackeys that they will see the day,

When the human flesh in their bowls are bombs!

At that time, all you ghosts and monsters of the night, look!

Will the sun appear on the horizon!

### Double Flying (56)

— Zhao Qingge

In such severe cold weather, Xiao Hong was only wearing an old thin cotton coat, and a single cloth pair of pants underneath. Before dawn, she had to get up and go out to buy vegetables, then cook breakfast. Poor Xiao Hong's hair and eyebrows were covered in frost when she returned from outside every morning, frozen into ice! But she couldn't utter a word about the cold, otherwise the boss's wife would scold her for pretending, saying, "These days, I am only taking in Xiao Hong to be a child bride, but I am not taking in Xiao Hong to be a young mistress! So she has to do some work. The Liao family's grain cannot be eaten for free!" In fact, the boss's wife's intention was to hire a perpetual long-term worker without spending any money. Naturally, Xiao Hong didn't dare to argue. She had often heard her mother say: A wife is always bound to suffer grievances. A young wife (the colloquial term for "child bride") will suffer even more torment. Moreover, her tailor father had told her that Liao Dong was not the boss's wife's biological son, so even Liao Dong was not in her heart, let alone Liao Dong's child bride? Understanding these things, Xiao Hong could only endure! She thought that once Liao Dong grew up, she could also get ahead. Like Liao Dong himself, she eagerly hoped that he would grow up quickly. She pinned all her hopes on Liao Dong! She worked hard and endured hardships, but the treatment she received was terrible! After she cooked three meals, serving the boss's wife and the others after they had finished eating, she could only fill her stomach with rice soaked in salt water. The boss's wife never thought to leave her some leftover food. In this weather where water turns to ice, the boss's wife ordered her to wash clothes basin after basin, but she was not allowed to use hot water because it was too expensive. While Xiao Hong was washing, the water in the basin froze over. The boss's wife had never seen this, much less considered it. What would happen to the hands of someone washing clothes in ice? Just like that, after finally finishing washing the clothes, the boss's wife told her to make shoes and socks for Boss Liao, her own son Liao Dong, and herself. Xiao Hong's fingers often bled under the needle, one stitch after another, as if piercing her heart! But Xiao Hong endured it with gritted teeth, never uttering a sound in front of or behind people. Only when she lay down on the bed to rest at night, the thin blanket couldn't keep out the cold, and her limbs were curled up all night, unable to straighten, her whole body without a trace of warmth. Then she thought: If she were at home, no matter how poor her mother was, she would burn a few pieces of firewood for her to keep warm. But here, she couldn't get near the brazier of the boss's wife even a step. Therefore, she cried, she quietly complained that her parents should not have sent her here! She would rather freeze or starve to death at home! But she was not willing to suffer endless torment here. Even if she froze or starved to death, her parents wouldn't know! Having no relatives to rely on, although she had a betrothed husband in name, she had never exchanged a single word with him until now. She was disheartened, she was sad! She felt that this day was like a black night with no dawn in sight until she sobbed and drifted into a dream, and only then did she truly get respite.

Boss Liao felt that Xiao Hong was even thinner than when he first saw her before she came to their house, and seeing her busy all day long, he felt very uneasy. So one time, he said to the boss's wife:

"Xiao Hong is not in good health, don't have her do too much work, she will be exhausted if this goes on! The weather is cold, it's pitiful."

But the boss's wife didn't think so at all. Said:

"When we took her in, it was originally to help me with my work, and you agreed to this. What? Don't tell me I have to serve her now?"

The boss's wife's tone was somewhat annoyed! She thought to herself, "Even the child bride of his first wife's son is being protected." Therefore, she felt even more antipathy towards Xiao Hong.
