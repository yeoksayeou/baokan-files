Embassy Counselor Smith and Baitaowa will accompany him. The ambassador also informed the reporter that he planned to return to Nanjing immediately after presenting his credentials to Chairman Chiang the day after tomorrow, because there were many embassy affairs here that needed to be dealt with. However, if Chairman Chiang insisted on him staying, he might stay for a while to tour this famous scenic spot. He also said that Marshal Ma will continue to perform his duties as usual and will go to Lushan in a few days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] It is learned that the government recently ordered six "C54" type aircraft from the United States. The form of this type of aircraft is slightly different from Marshal Marshall's special "C54" type, and can land at Jiujiang Airport. Therefore, the government has designated one of these six aircraft specifically for Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart to fly between Nanjing and Kuling.

### Draft Sino-American Commercial Treaty Being Negotiated by Both Sides

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The draft Sino-American commercial treaty is being negotiated by both sides and will soon be submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Executive Yuan for deliberation.

Not only will it be related to mutually beneficial trade between the two countries in the future, but other countries' commercial treaties with China will also inevitably use this as a blueprint.

### Government Attaches Great Importance to the Kunming Assassination Case; Tang Zong Was Sent to Yunnan to Investigate Thoroughly; Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A foreign reporter reception was held at the Propaganda Department of the Central Executive Committee at 4 pm on the 17th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The main questions and answers are as follows:

(Question) The Communist Party has strongly criticized the government for the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo in Kunming. What is the truth?

Minister Peng replied: The government attaches great importance to this case. Who committed this matter, I am unwilling to speculate out of thin air. Before the case is investigated, any arbitrary guesses on any side are unfair. The President of the Executive Yuan has issued a circular to all provincial and municipal governments to provide special protection to people of political parties in various places. Director Tang Zong of the Police Department has been dispatched to Kunming to supervise the thorough investigation and find out the truth in a short period of time. The government considers the occurrence of such events to be the greatest regret, and will certainly investigate it strictly. No matter who did it, it will be severely punished without leniency after it is found out.

(Question) Is it true that Pan Guangdan and other eight members of the Kunming Democratic League have requested protection from the US Consulate?

Minister Peng replied: I have also received reports. The Executive Yuan has telegraphed the Kunming Garrison Commander to provide special police protection to the relevant personnel and provide them with other protections that they hope for, while not hindering their freedom of movement.

(Question) It is generally believed that the Chairman's trip to Kuling means the end of peace talks, at least for the time being. Could you please explain this situation? If the negotiations continue, how will they proceed? Minister Peng replied: Peace negotiations are still continuing. In this era of telecommunications and aviation, the short distance between Nanjing and Kuling does not constitute an obstacle to negotiations.

(Question) Where is Pu Yi now? When and where will he be handed over to the Chinese government?

Vice Minister Liu replied: Pu Yi has not yet entered the country. Negotiations on the handover are still in progress. In addition, if you want to know anything else: Foreign Minister Wang is determined to go to Paris to participate in the peace conference in the near future.

(Question) Will the main parts of the government move to Kuling? How long will Chairman Chiang be stationed in Kuling? Minister Peng replied: The government remains in Nanjing. Meetings of the Supreme National Defense Council and the Executive Yuan are still held in Nanjing. The Chairman's stay in Kuling is undetermined.

According to him, the trip lasted five days, two days in Taiyuan, and two days in Gui Sui. On the way from Taiyuan to Gui Sui, there was a two-hour stop in Datong. The order in Taiyuan is stable. The situation in southern Jin, since the capture of Wenxi and other places, has also stabilized. Shanxi has recently had heavy rains, and autumn harvest can be expected. Grain prices have fallen sharply. When reporters asked about any deep impressions in Taiyuan, they mentioned that the officials' hard work and perseverance are truly admirable. Speaking of the situation in Datong, Director Li said that there are no large-scale conflicts in Datong at the moment, and the communist army is outside thirty to forty miles around.

The future of Suiyuan's agriculture, industry, and mining is very promising: There are already more than 2,000 acres of land in Houtao that have successfully planted rice. The province is rich in coal and iron deposits, which can be mined on a large scale in the future. When reporters finally asked if there would be a large-scale war in North China in the near future, Director Li's answer was "That has to be asked to the Communist Party."

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Li Zongren flew from Beiping to Jin on the morning of the 12th to visit Chief Yan. The special plane arrived at Bingyuan at 11:40 am.

### A Night Visit to John Leighton Stuart

— Our Beijing Correspondent, Pu Dejie

In April of this year, General Marshall returned to the United States to report to President Truman. It is said that on the first morning, after his meeting with President Truman, the President summoned Dr. John Leighton Stuart in the afternoon. No one knows what they discussed, but one thing, "street news," began to spread. It spread throughout the United States and to China, saying that General Marshall's months of work in China were not enough to compensate for his hard work, that he was tired, tired, and that Dr. Stuart would replace him. Not many days later, General Marshall returned to China, traveling from Chongqing to Nanjing, still tirelessly working for this troubled friendly nation. Dr. Stuart also quietly returned to Beiping, focusing on taking care of the reopening of Yenching University. However, this did not make people—especially particularly perceptive reporters—fully believe that Dr. Stuart was not involved in negotiations between the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party, because when he was in Nanjing, he often went in and out of General Marshall's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road.

Today (the 15th) at noon, Ambassador Stuart flew from Beiping to Nanjing again. This was undoubtedly the person and event that Nanjing reporters paid the most attention to, so everyone started playing hide-and-seek, trying their best to visit this old friend of China, the new ambassador. The reporter arrived at the American Embassy on Shanghai Road at 7:20 PM, but because the new ambassador was out on official business, they did not meet. It was not until 9:30 PM that the reporter returned to Shanghai Road, but the ambassador had not yet returned. They had no choice but to go to Ninghai Road. Sure enough, the new ambassador was watching a movie with General Marshall. So the reporter decided to wait, this opportunity could not be missed. At the same time, from the ambassador's driver, they learned that after leaving the embassy at 6:30 PM, the ambassador first went to No. 6 Yihe Road to see Advisor Chuan, who had a cold, staying for about a quarter of an hour, and then went to Ninghai Road to have dinner with General Marshall. Afterwards, they watched a movie together.

"The movie just ended!" It was 10:05 PM.

Sitting in the "Jeep," waiting, waiting, waiting, at 10:25 PM, General Marshall's car drove out, with Ambassador Stuart sitting inside. The reporter quickly followed, all the way to the ambassador's residence on Shanghai Road. The reporter jumped out of the "Jeep," took a few steps, and with a business card and a "Your Excellency," greeted the kind and approachable old scholar at his car door. He smiled and said, "A few minutes, that's fine!"

This was a small sitting room, with a desk and chair, a pair of sofas, a pair of soft chairs, and some simple stationery. A chandelier hung in the center of the room, and the soft light made people forget the stuffy heat from two hours ago. The reporter and the ambassador sat opposite each other on the low soft chairs, and I listened to the old scholar's soft words.

"I didn't go anywhere today, and I didn't see anyone. The schedule for the next few days has not been set yet. What I am doing now is arranging personal matters and preparing to present my credentials. At the same time, I am studying the current situation. Before presenting my credentials, any work is out of the question."

"When does the ambassador plan to meet with President Chiang? Where will you present your credentials?"

"That all depends on what President Chiang decides, the place to present the credentials—"

"Lushan?"

"Perhaps."

"I heard from Director Li of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that preparations have already been made to hold the ceremony for presenting credentials in Lushan."

"Very likely," the ambassador smiled. Then he said, "Tomorrow I will contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss my schedule for the next few days."

"When does the ambassador plan to meet with Mr. Zhou Enlai?"

"I haven't considered this issue yet. Before I see President Chiang and present my credentials, I am not prepared to formally meet with anyone."

"Is the ambassador going to hold a press conference?"

"I haven't prepared one yet, but I will keep your card and contact you at any time. I will definitely provide you with as much news as possible."

"Was the movie the ambassador watched today good? What movie was it?"

"Ah, not good. General Marshall asked me to watch a movie because I was tired. It was called: 'In Tangier' T. A. N... a place in northern America."

"Afterwards, he asked me about my studies, and he also mentioned the journalism department at Yenching University. In the soft light, I saw that he seemed tired. I thanked him for giving me this opportunity to talk, and even more thanked him for his tireless efforts for the happiness of the Chinese people." He replied to me: "I love China. I am taking on this position as a scholar to help General Marshall and work for peace in China. I hope my work will not fail."

At this point, I stood up, exchanged goodnights, and the reporter repeatedly thanked him for his kindness, and then took my leave.

It was 10:41 PM. The moonlight was like water, and the reporter was left with a deep impression—a sincere, amiable, warm, and prudent old man. I hope he can join forces with General Marshall to help us, I hope we, help ourselves, and break the current heavy and gloomy situation.

—Late night, July 15th

### UNRRA Far East Conference Solemnly Held in Shanghai Yesterday; Decision Made to Extend Transportation of Materials to China Until the End of June Next Year; Zhou Enlai Arrives in Shanghai Today to Continue Discussions on the Yellow River Damming Project

[United Press, Shanghai] The UNRRA Far East Conference resolved today: (1) To recommend to the UNRRA General Assembly in Geneva that the deadline for the transportation of UNRRA relief supplies to China be extended from March 31, 1947, to June 30, 1947. (2) To recommend that UNRRA negotiate with the Chinese government to maintain the UNRRA China Office until December 31, 1947. When the conference passed the resolution, the hope that UNRRA Director General LaGuardia would soon lift the order to suspend the transportation of materials to China gradually became stronger. The conference also voted today to pass the report of the subcommittee, with only Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu casting a dissenting vote. The report will be submitted to the UNRRA General Assembly, stating that despite various efforts, the work of distributing UNRRA relief supplies in the areas occupied by the Chinese Communist Party has not yet been completed. In recent months, the distribution work of the CNRRA has been seriously hindered due to insufficient funds.

(Our Newspaper) The UNRRA Far East Conference was solemnly held yesterday morning on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. Those present included China's Jiang Tingfu, Xiang Jingyun, Australia's Cowan, France's Bertin, India's Hassan, New Zealand's Shaw, Netherlands' Sterke, Britain's Miss Xingde, the Soviet Union's Seminas, and the United States' Kirkpatrick. Jiang Tingfu served as chairman, and Mr. Lai, the acting director of the UNRRA China Office who had just returned to Shanghai from Beiping, served as secretary.

(Morning Session)

After Jiang explained the agenda of the meeting, discussions began. US representative Kirkpatrick said that the CNRRA shipping team has now been handed over to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, placing the team under a government agency, which he thought was not very appropriate. Jiang replied that in his opinion, according to UNRRA regulations, the shipping team was directly under the jurisdiction of the CNRRA. Subsequently, Mr. Saber, Director of the UNRRA Repatriation Bureau, reported that Mayor Wu had inquired whether European refugees could be repatriated as soon as possible in order to free up empty houses for our repatriated compatriots. The Chinese authorities hoped to complete the repatriation within six months, but in fact, among the 15,000 European refugees in Shanghai, only 6,000 had expressed their intention to return to their home countries. The rest wanted to go to the United States, Australia, Canada, etc., and waiting for passports approved for entry into those countries might take two or three years. Even for the refugees who wished to return to their home countries, the military authorities currently managing the European region (especially Germany and Austria) had not yet reached an agreement on their repatriation. Saber requested that the conference provide some guidance on how to handle this matter. US representative Kirkpatrick expressed deep sympathy for the difficulties UNRRA was facing, and said that it might not be easy for these refugees to go to the United States. Kirkpatrick also said that the Chinese government should pay attention to this serious issue. Jiang Tingfu replied that the CNRRA would do its best to find a solution, but the final policy would still be determined by the Chinese government. The US representative then made some statements about the treatment of Korean residents in Peiping and Tianjin, and expressed the hope that Korean residents would not be discriminated against.

The Soviet representative then raised an inquiry, requesting a detailed explanation of how the Ministry of Health was allocating funds from UNRRA. Jiang replied that the funds were controlled by the Chinese government, and he could not speak for the government as to whether it could provide relevant information.

The US representative also said that the CNRRA did not charge the Ministry of Transportation for assembling trucks and locomotives, and he believed that the Chinese government should pay a price.

The Indian representative suggested that the CNRRA could consider paying cash when implementing relief projects, so that flour and other items could be distributed to areas in more urgent need.

Mayor Wu also came to listen in at around 11:00 AM and left at noon. The conference adjourned for a break at 12:30 PM.

(Afternoon Session)

The meeting reconvened at 4:15 PM. The first item on the agenda was to discuss the UNRRA work period. It was decided to recommend to the Fifth General Assembly (to be held in Geneva on August 5) that the transportation of UNRRA supplies to China be extended to June 30 of the following year. At the same time, UNRRA should negotiate with China to extend the UNRRA China Office to the end of the following year. All budgets and plans regarding this point should be submitted to the Far East General Assembly for discussion before the end of this year. If there is still a need for continued transportation when the transportation period expires next year, then it can be considered whether to extend it again.

Regarding the internal reorganization of UNRRA, Jiang had consulted with President Song many times since late June. On July 16, President Song also held a meeting with Jiang, Lai, and several senior officials of the UNRRA China Office. In addition to the reorganization method, they also discussed how the CNRRA and UNRRA could cooperate more closely in the future. The methods decided at that time have been gradually implemented. The most important point of the reorganization is to increase the power of the Executive Director. The work of financial allocation, storage and transportation, and all branch offices, personnel, and distribution will be the responsibility of the Executive Director. However, the Director will decide when UNRRA distributes materials to the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan or other units. In addition, the Executive Yuan will send representatives to the Distribution Office. As for the UNRRA's Industrial, Mining, and Health Committees, the Executive Director must approve any sales of materials. UNRRA must also send senior officials to work at the Executive Yuan, responsible for contacting all ministries and commissions. Furthermore, if UNRRA borrows foreign personnel in the future, the Director, Deputy Director, and Executive Director must jointly decide.

UNRRA's overdraft expenses have now been decided not to exceed 80 billion this year, and not to exceed 30 billion in any one month.

The method of strengthening cooperation between UNRRA and UNRRA in the future has been decided that the process of official correspondence must be accelerated. In addition, UNRRA should be responsible for inspecting materials when they are shipped and guarantee that the materials can be used, otherwise UNRRA will not accept them. When transporting machinery, they must also provide full instructions for use and all spare parts.

The materials currently piled up in Shanghai warehouses are mostly heavy machinery. Efforts are being made to clear them, and Liu Hongsheng, Hua Fengxiang, Chen Guangyuan, and others have formed a clearing committee with UNRRA personnel to handle this matter.

From January 1 to July 10 of this year, the total amount of labor expenses received by UNRRA was 432,000,000,000 yuan in legal currency, with 172,260,117,400 yuan actually paid out, leaving a balance of 259,739,882,600 yuan. The main items of expenditure were: repairing national coal roads, the Yellow River project, miscellaneous expenses and salaries for foreign experts and other expenses, emergency relief for refugees (including refugees in northern Jiangsu, especially the two times on June 20 and July 9), coastal defense projects, and other water conservancy projects such as river embankments.

[Another report] Zhou Enlai is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Beijing this morning (the 18th) to continue discussing the Yellow River damming project with Jiang Tingfu. The time is set for 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM. Therefore, today's UNRRA Far East Conference will be postponed until 11:30 AM.

### China's Allocation of UNRRA Materials Has Never Had a Political Function; Ambassador Gu Has Been Instructed by Telegram to Explain in Detail to UNRRA

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] Regarding UNRRA's sudden suspension of the shipment of materials to China, both the US State Department and Special Envoy Marshall have stated to our government one after another that they were not aware of it beforehand. US Department of Agriculture expert Harrison has stated in the United States that to his knowledge, China's allocation of materials has never had a political function. Opinions from officials and people in society here believe that UNRRA is an organization of the United Nations, and China is also a sovereign state participating in its formation. UNRRA has absolutely no right to suddenly suspend the shipment of materials to any country that should receive relief without the consent of all participating countries. It is regrettable that some staff members of the UNRRA China Office were unaware of the facts and were taken advantage of, and UNRRA was too credulous. The government has instructed Ambassador Gu by telegram to explain in detail to the US government and UNRRA, and hopes for an immediate resumption.

### Post-War Factory Resettlement Committee Requests Formation of Joint Factories; Sends Six Representatives to Beijing to Petition

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The Post-War Factory Resettlement Committee of the China Production Promotion Association, representing more than 50 factories, sent six representatives to Beijing to petition. Yesterday morning and afternoon, they visited Vice Minister Pan Xulun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Minister Wang Yunwu to present their opinions on forming joint factories. Today, they went to the Executive Yuan, and Secretary Li Xunhe arranged for them to meet with President Song or Secretary-General Jiang Menglin tomorrow. At the same time, the representatives are preparing to appeal to the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Supreme National Defense Council. They also plan to host a reception for the capital's press at the Lishi Society at 3:00 PM tomorrow to make a report. The group will return to Shanghai on the 19th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Xie Tianhe, the general director of the Post-War Factory Resettlement Committee affiliated with the China Production Promotion Association, recently told reporters that the association is composed of representatives from more than 50 small and medium-sized factories that moved inland to Shanghai. More than 400 factories that moved inland from the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi are also gradually being contacted to join. Most of the factories remaining in the rear are currently in a state of shutdown. After the representatives of the factories arrived in Shanghai, they were all eager to fulfill their past aspirations of serving the country through industry and to contribute to post-war reconstruction. They observed that in Shanghai, the enemy and puppet factories that had been taken over, since the authorities sold off a portion of them through bidding, most lacked buyers, resulting in an unreasonable phenomenon of factories shutting down on one hand and workers losing their jobs on the other. Although the member factories of the association intend to engage in operations, they lack the funds to purchase the factories. Therefore, after careful consideration, they drafted a "Joint Factory Plan," proposing that the authorities allocate the majority of unsold factories to the member factories of the association for joint operation. The total value of each factory should be estimated in advance, and stocks or company bonds should be issued, held by the government, and stipulated that the joint factory will begin to repurchase or repay them after one year, and pay off the entire amount in installments within ten years, so that unemployed workers can be accommodated and domestic production can be increased, and the industrialists who moved inland can continue to exert their patriotic enthusiasm. Xie finally said that the association's plan had previously received support from relevant government departments. The purpose of coming to Beijing this time is to negotiate concrete principles to make it a reality.

### Pan Xulun's Talk

Assisting the Resettlement of Factories Moved Inland; Considering the Waiver of Principal and Interest on Industrial Loans

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the issue of assisting the resettlement of factories moved inland after the war, according to Economic Vice-Minister Pan Xulun, the government's measures are as follows: the government should assist the resettlement of factories moved inland with preferential treatment, and in principle, there is absolutely no room for doubt. (1) Because the degree of contribution of factories moved inland to the War of Resistance is different, they should receive assistance, even if they obtain an impartial standard. (2) There are also questions about whether the performance and types of enemy and puppet factories taken over in the recovered areas, in addition to a portion that has been allocated to the Resources Committee for operation, are completely suitable for the individual needs of the factories being resettled inland. It has recently been heard that a portion of factories moved inland have formed a resettlement committee and have prepared a joint factory plan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs welcomes this, but it is hoped that this type of group can expand and become widespread. As for the methods of assisting the resettlement of factories moved inland, it is not limited to the above. For example, the government's emergency industrial loans of 2.7 billion yuan to factories in the rear last year are also being considered for waiver of both principal and interest to provide relief and show encouragement.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Chinese Historical Society held a tea party at the Capital Hotel at 10:00 AM on the 17th to welcome Dr. Hu Shi, a director of the society. Hu reported on his nine years of life in the United States, saying that he had spent two years examining 29 versions of the Waterways Classic Commentary and settling a 150-year-old scholarly dispute. Hu believes that: (1) Quan Zuwang did not write an absurd Waterways Classic Commentary, but it was written by Wang Zicai; (2) Zhao Yiqing's Waterways Classic Commentary, which continued Quan's efforts, is the best; (3) Dai Dongyuan did not see Zhao's book and took a different path to the same conclusion as Zhao, and there is no accusation of plagiarism. After Hu finished his report, he left in advance, and the society continued to discuss affairs and adjourned.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] Dr. Hu Shi will take the night train to Shanghai tonight and is scheduled to fly to Peiping on the 20th.

### American Experts to Come to China This Year to Help Us Build Agricultural Engineering

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The International Harvester Company of Chicago, in order to assist our government in establishing an agricultural engineering foundation, donated US$422,000 to our government for the purpose of hiring experts, sending students, and purchasing research equipment. Our government has now hired four agricultural engineering experts, Davidson, Sisson, McCrawley, and Hanson, to come to China to work. All four are well-known agricultural engineering experts in the United States. Davidson is especially a leading figure in the agricultural engineering field, having served as the head of the agricultural engineering department at Iowa State University for more than 20 years, and many American agricultural engineers have come from his tutelage. The four are now scheduled to come to China this year, first working at the Beiping Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture, and then serving as engineering technicians at the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and professors at Central University and Jinling University. The term of service is three years. Their research plans include three aspects: (1) researching and improving our agricultural implements, (2) researching and improving small machines that can develop rural agriculture, and (3) researching and improving all rural buildings and building materials. All equipment used for research and education is donated by the International Harvester Company, with US$80,000 for the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and US$15,000 each for Central University and Jinling University. The four are currently selecting and shipping them to China in batches.

### Truman Signs Bill to Assist Us in Strengthening Navy, Transferring 271 Ships to Our Country

[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] President Truman today signed a bill stipulating assistance to the Republic of China in strengthening and maintaining its naval organization. The bill authorizes the President to supply China with up to 271 U.S. naval vessels, plus floating docks and other necessary materials. The bill stipulates training of sailors for these fleets, and, upon China's request, the dispatch of 100 U.S. naval officers and 200 soldiers to China. The President has discretion over the payment terms and conditions for these fleets. The Senate's report on the Naval Aid to China Bill stated that China currently only needs destroyer patrol-class and smaller light vessels. China's need to rebuild its coastal defense is similar to the vessels needed by the U.S. Coast Guard. Other vessels needed by China include those for clearing Japanese mines, repatriating Japanese, transporting overseas Chinese returning home, and developing coastal shipping. The U.S. Navy Department announced that it is willing to transfer 271 vessels to China, currently located in the Far East. This batch of surplus vessels includes two floating docks, two repair ships, two destroyer patrol vessels, twenty-four minesweepers, twenty-eight submarine chasers, one hundred and ninety-three landing craft, three oil tankers, one survey ship, six motor torpedo boats, and six pontoons and light ferries.

Editorial

### Byrnes' Broadcast

U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, upon returning to Washington from Paris, delivered a national broadcast yesterday, reporting on the progress and results of the recent Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet representative's strong stance at the Foreign Ministers Conference, often holding solitary views, resulted in a failure to reach agreement on several important issues. Byrnes sternly criticized this Soviet policy. Indeed, since the Foreign Ministers Conference convened in Paris last month, the atmosphere in the meeting place has been quite disharmonious. On several current European issues, if Britain and the United States advocated something, the Soviet Union would invariably oppose it; if the Soviet Union advocated something, it would likewise be opposed by Britain and the United States. The unfolding of this scene truly causes apprehension. The defeat of the Axis powers originally relied on the collaborative efforts of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Now that the Axis powers have been defeated, the major powers have significant differences of opinion regarding the reconstruction of world peace. Considering the future, how can one not feel hidden worry?

The last Paris Foreign Ministers Conference took a very long time. Although there was a decision to convene a peace conference in Paris on July 29th, and a compromise agreement was reached on the Trieste issue, several major issues remain unresolved. The plan to control Germany was shelved due to the Soviet Union's solitary opposition; there was also no achievement on the Austrian issue due to the Soviet Union's solitary dissent. Even the agreement reached on Trieste, in its nature, did not resolve the Trieste issue in any way. Merely having an international organization manage the area often not only fails to eliminate the problem, but instead makes it increasingly serious. Danzig and Memel are precedents. The agreement reached on Trieste at this Foreign Ministers Conference, entrusting Trieste to the control of the United Nations, is sufficient to show mutual concessions. However, it has not provided a thorough resolution to this thorny issue, leaving future problems behind. Why could a thorough resolution not be reached on this issue? For Britain and the United States, it is because the Soviet Union has swept through Eastern Europe, and its expansion must be curbed. For the Soviet Union, it is because Trieste is the main port for Eastern and Central Europe to access the sea. Acquiring Trieste would be enough to control the Adriatic Sea, shaking the advantage of Britain and the United States in the Mediterranean. At the same time, the Soviet Union also wants to acquire Italy's colonies in North Africa. Its intentions originally had profound strategic significance. The Trieste issue is a test of the competition of power. Both sides insisted on not yielding, and therefore had to seek points where they could compromise within that insistence. Therefore, the Trieste issue looks like it is resolved, but in reality, it is not.

Since the defeat of the Axis powers, international diplomacy in this past year has everywhere revealed the inability of Soviet and British-American policies to coordinate. The Soviet Union single-handedly resisted the brutal enemy in Eastern Europe, creating a glorious battlefield. This naturally easily aroused a sense of psychological superiority in the Soviet Union. Based on this sense of superiority, it looked down on the world, and then actively extended its power. All of this conflicted with the policies of Britain and the United States. Policy is the expression of thought. The lack of coordination in policy between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is actually due to differences in thought. We must remember that the Soviet Union itself is an international organization. Its original name was "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics." The so-called Russia is only a part of the "Soviet Union." The purpose of this international organization is naturally not limited to encompassing the territory of the Tsarist empire. Its ultimate goal is for the entire world to belong to the "Soviet Union." With the collapse of the Axis powers, the Soviet Union's military strength reached an unprecedented level. At this time, it is understandable that the Soviet Union wanted to actively expand its power. Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, William Bullitt, said in his recent book "The Great Globe Itself," "The totalitarian imperialism that threatens the whole world today is none other than the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is to establish a Communist dictatorship throughout the world. If the United States does not immediately take various steps to stop its growth, it must submit to it. We are seen as a giant with feet of clay by the world, and the people who follow our lead have begun to doubt whether we are intelligent and resourceful enough to plan for freedom and peace. We rely on the atomic bomb and a large air force, so today we are stronger than the Soviet Union and can destroy it. But if we know that the Soviet government intends to wage war against us in the future and strike first, this action will lower our moral standards and become one with the Communists."

Bullitt was an early sympathizer of the Bolshevik Revolution, and also served as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He had a deep understanding of the Soviet Union. His publication of the above remarks, though inevitably a bit excessive, shows that he was well aware of the Soviet Union's ambition to rule the world. It is this fundamental difference in thought that causes a conflict in policy between Britain and the United States regarding the reconstruction of world peace. We are geographically connected to the Soviet Union. For the sake of lasting world peace, we always hope that this difference in thought and conflict in policy can be coordinated, so that the distance between them can become smaller and smaller. Therefore, when we talk about Byrnes' broadcast, and see him say, "We do not believe that peace should be based on revenge. We believe in true selfless generosity. If we treat others with kindness and compassion, we can turn enemies into friends. We must trust in peace, and pray that God will have mercy and grant world peace," we cannot help but feel a full of sympathy. This task is arduous; but if we treat others with kindness and compassion, who knows if we cannot turn enemies into friends. We are moved by such a devout religious spirit. Using this spirit to overcome difficulties should be successful in everything. We respectfully extend our respect and admiration to Byrnes, and hope that his efforts will succeed!

Since about 50 female prisoners were transferred from the detention centers on Masnan Road and North Zhejiang Road a few days ago, the total number of female prisoners held has reached more than 170. According to news from the prison, many of the female prisoners are poor and sick, and prison doctors are currently trying to treat them and are intensifying prevention measures. The situation has been reported to the court authorities, requesting them to instruct the various detention centers not to transfer large numbers of female prisoners to the prison again to avoid overcrowding.

#### Training Camp on Fuxing Island
Training Three Naval Battalions
The First Battalion to be Assigned to Warships After Graduation
[Our Newspaper's Report] The United States has gifted us a total of 271 ships, of which 8 warships have already been received by us and sailed to Tokyo. Landing craft are also being delivered to us one after another. Our naval authorities have recently been training a large number of naval soldiers in Jiangyin, Shanghai, and other places to meet the demand. The First Naval Training Camp recently moved from Nanshi to Fuxing Island in Pudong, which was previously the Japanese naval base. When reporters visited the island yesterday to inquire about the naval training situation, Deputy Camp Commander Zhao said: The camp currently has three training battalions. The first and second battalions were recruited, and the third battalion consists of youth soldiers transferred from other units. The four-month training period for the first battalion is coming to an end, and graduation is scheduled to take place around the 20th. After graduation, they will be assigned to the warships gifted to us by the United States. These warships will sail to Nanjing for stationing after arriving in Shanghai from Tokyo. Approximately 200 trainees will graduate this time and will continue to receive training on the warships for two months before being promoted to formal third-class privates.

#### Eight US-Donated Warships
Expected to Arrive at Wusong Estuary Tonight
Whether to Stop in Shanghai or Sail Directly to Nanjing Remains Undetermined
The eight warships donated to us by the US government left South America in April of this year, passing through San Francisco, Pearl Harbor, and Midway Island. After three months, they arrived in Tokyo on the 11th and departed for China on the 15th. The journey is expected to arrive at the Wusong Estuary at 9:00 PM tonight. However, whether they will enter the Huangpu River to stop in Shanghai or sail directly to Nanjing to report to the Naval Headquarters has not been determined due to a lack of orders from the Nanjing Headquarters. It is reported that when these eight ships set sail from the United States, the Naval Attaché to the United States, Liu Tianfu, and the leader of the fleet, Colonel Lin Zun, held a reception ceremony. Among them, two were escort destroyers (each weighing 1,300 tons), two were anti-submarine ships (each weighing 1,100 tons), and four were minesweeper/minelayers (each weighing 800 tons). More than 80 naval officers and more than 1,000 soldiers, who were sent to the United States for training by our country in 1944, sailed back to China, led by Colonel Lin Zun as the overall leader. In addition to the eight warships, there was also a transport ship specially dispatched by the United States.

#### Pickpockets Active on Trolleys
Passengers Wearing Strange Hats for Advertisement
Pickpocketing is rampant on the city's trams, and the general public is complaining. Although the police authorities have made every effort to suppress it, it is still difficult to completely eliminate. Yesterday, on the French-owned No. 7 tram running on the Bund and Rue Cardinal Foch, a passenger wore a paper hat similar to that of a "Wu Chang" (a figure from Chinese mythology), with the words "Beware of Pickpockets" written on it. Passengers in the tram covered their mouths and laughed, and passers-by also stopped to watch. According to the person, he had been visited by pickpockets four times in one month, and the loss of money was not small. This would make tram passengers pay attention at all times, and pickpockets would be seen and avoided.

#### Selling Paintings to Make a Living in a Small Corner Building
Yuan Xiluo's Life is Simple and Hard
"If Mao Zedong and the others continue to stir things up like this, I'm afraid it won't do them or the country any good, and we will suffer even more." The highly respected Mr. Yuan Xiluo said in his slow Baoshan accent.
Yes, Yuan Xiluo said so. This can represent the views of sincere and pure elders—perhaps you don't remember, when Premier Sun Yat-sen took office as the Provisional President, Mr. Yuan was the representative who presented the seal. However, at the age of 71, he lives in a small corner building near the French Park, supporting his simple remaining years by selling calligraphy, paintings, and fan paintings for meager income.
When reporters went to visit him presumptuously, Mr. Yuan was painting a "Huangshan" fan painting. Although the high building seemed simple, it was spotless and exceptionally elegant, matching the light colors of the painting.
Yuan Xiluo devoted his life to education, so he was content with simplicity and remained the same for decades. In 1933, he served as the magistrate of Nanhui County for three years and was also a pioneer in establishing Qidong as a new county under a branch customs office. However, apart from a bonus of more than ten thousand yuan from the authorities, he still returned empty-handed.
With this bonus, Mr. Yuan bought some sandy land in Qidong and built a house. He planted hundreds of plum trees in front and a vegetable garden in the back. Mr. Yuan planned to be a citizen of Ge Tian, uncontested with the world, in those small houses—who knew that the disaster of all Chinese people would come.
On the eve of the Japanese occupation of Qidong, he fled to Shanghai. Life began to squeeze out his only savings like a high-pressure bed. Mr. Yuan's fate was the same as that of all those who sought refuge in Shanghai but were not good at (or unwilling) to plunder. Gradually, the money dried up like water, and daily meals became simpler in proportion.
He could have been promoted and made a fortune. Weren't many traitors emerging, eating delicacies, and living extravagantly? Haven't they come up with all kinds of nice-sounding excuses to cover up their past deeds today? One said: "I was forced by the enemy and puppet regime." Another said: "I was forced by life." At that time, Mr. Yuan Xiluo, who was under the pressure of life, had not been surrounded by villains. The Japanese wanted him to maintain the local area, but he refused. The Wang Jingwei government wanted him to be the Minister of Civil Affairs, but he also refused. They even asked him to go to Nanjing to run a library, but the old gentleman also refused.
He silently tightened his belt and wrote all six volumes of the "History of the Japanese Invasion of China War". When the Japanese searched the Hongying Library, he secretly took them home to write. In his bitter heart, there was only one hope: victory. However, victory did not bring him anything, because prices were scorched by the raging flames of war, making it impossible for every honest ordinary people to survive. Therefore, Mr. Yuan Xiluo also uttered a weak cry: "Stop it, why doesn't the Communist Party withdraw from northern Jiangsu? Why don't they give up the army? Can't the suffering ordinary people have a chance to recuperate?"
Mr. Yuan once thought about going to Yan'an to starve himself to death, and he also wrote two articles on the "Datong Liyunpian" and handed them over to Zhou Enlai to forward them to Mao Zedong and Zhu De for "elegant recitation". Thanks to the gift of the two men, Yuan Xiluo makes a living by painting fans (excuse me for saying so). However, it is not a crime, so why be ashamed? (Zhong Shi).

#### Gan Deyun Sent Back for Retrial
Stating that Opposing England is His Consistent Stance
Xu Xiqing and Liu Shengwu to be Sentenced on the 24th
[Our Newspaper's Report] Gan Deyun, also known as Gan Weilu, 62 years old, his father was English and his mother was Cantonese. Because he opposed the English government's policies towards China in his early years, the English government revoked his citizenship. Gan then became a Chinese citizen in 1926. He joined the Lawyers Association in 1936 and practiced law in Shanghai. In the spring of 1940, he met Chen Gongbo through Wen Zongyao and joined the puppet government, serving as a "Legislative Member" until he resigned in 1942. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Gan founded the English publication "The Voice of New China" to promote the rejection of Britain and the United States. After the victory, the British Naval Office in Shanghai reported him to the city police, and Gan was arrested and transferred to the court, which sentenced him to seven years in prison. Gan expressed his disagreement and appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting a retrial. The case was sent back for retrial and was heard again by a collegial panel in the High Court yesterday morning. Gan used English to recount how he had helped the government recover the British Concession in Hankou and abolish unequal treaties in the past. He also stated that opposing British imperialism was his consistent stance, not only during the enemy and puppet regime. He also stated that he had no work as a "Legislative Member" and did not participate in advocacy because he did not understand the national language. The trial of the case concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 24th. On the same day, the cases of Xu Xiqing, editor-in-chief of the puppet Central News Agency, Liu Shengwu, magistrate of the puppet Chongming County, and Ge Shengwen, a puppet agent, were also concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for the morning of the 24th. In addition, the case of Pan Amao, a secret agent of the puppet Yin County Security Team, was scheduled for sentencing at 9:30 AM on the 23rd.

#### 1946 License Tax Collected at the Same Rate as Last Term
Deadline for Payment is the End of August
[Our Newspaper's Report] The business license tax for this year was announced and levied by the Finance Bureau earlier.

#### Fourteen Major Types of Chinese Export Goods
Exhibition for One Week Starting September 1
[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the first preparatory meeting of the China Export Goods Exhibition was held a few days ago, various departments are actively promoting the work in order to hold the exhibition on schedule on the first day of September at the Youth Association Building on the first and second floors of this city. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Zhang Yifan, Secretary-General of the China National Economic Research Institute, who is responsible for the publicity work of the exhibition, and learned the details of the exhibition.

#### Wang Xingjian Sentenced to Imprisonment
One Year and Four Months
[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Xingjian, a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Department of Datong University, currently works at the Ministry of Communications. He was reported as a traitor. After many months of trial by the High Court, he was finally sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment for conspiring with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country. It is reported that Wang joined the Loyal Salvation Army at the beginning of the war and worked. Later, he was arrested by the enemy's police and served at the "76" and "Central Savings Bank." However, he still maintained contact with the rear agencies and regularly communicated news. Therefore, when the sentence was pronounced yesterday, the judge explained that because the defendant's initial participation in the puppet position was out of necessity, and he had made some contributions to assisting the war of resistance, the sentence was reduced again and again. If the defendant is not satisfied, he can appeal to the Supreme Court for review. Wang is currently released on bail and needs to wait for the retrial before deciding whether to execute the sentence.

#### Cai Pei to be Sentenced Today

After the victory, the authorities arrested him on suspicion of being an economic traitor and transferred him to the court.

#### Guo Zhenxiang Sentenced to Three Years
In addition, Guo Zhenxiang, a detective team member of the Puppet Dongchang Road Police Station, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of political rights. Wu Baofu was found not guilty.

#### Xu Jiang on Trial
Amassing Wealth by Controlling Materials
[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court opened a court yesterday afternoon to try the case of Xu Jiang, the former director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau. It was found that Xu worked in the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications before the war. He joined the puppet government after the war and successively served as the section chief of the Puppet Taxation Bureau, the director of the Puppet Silk Construction Special Tax Office, the director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau, and a director of the Puppet Xieji Company. During his tenure, he forcibly occupied tax revenue, harmed the silk industry, controlled various materials, handled commodity registration, and purchased food to support the enemy. Xu also amassed wealth and acquired a lot of property. After being questioned by the judge yesterday, he was ordered to reschedule the trial.
On the same day, the cases of Sun Wenhai, the former chief of the training section of the Puppet Special Headquarters, Zheng Liangbin, the former director of the Puppet Huazhong Shipping Company, Li Xingyi, a businessman suspected of aiding the enemy, and Yuan Shixiang and Chen Huichang, the owners of the La Dahua Dance Hall and the Venus Cafe, were all rescheduled for retrial.

#### Dai Buxiang and Others Summoned for Concealing Xie Baosheng's Property
[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court Prosecutor's Office summoned Dai Buxiang (manager of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road) and Xie Wenkui to the court yesterday morning for questioning, because the two were suspected of concealing the property of Xie Baosheng, the former deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Police Department.

#### British Airways Contract Expires, Our Transportation is Sufficient
[Our Newspaper's Report] The contract signed by the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) with the British shipping company to transport relief materials has expired and been cancelled. The reporter visited the person in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday to inquire about the subsequent handling. It is reported that although CNRRA previously signed contracts with British companies to transport relief materials, some of them were also transported by Chinese shipping companies. After the cancellation of the contract, the company and other Chinese companies will take over all the transportation. The transportation capacity should be sufficient.

#### Taikoo Jardine Company Clarifies Business Position
[Another Report] The British shipping companies Taikoo and Jardine, in order to clarify their own business position and make statements regarding maritime trade rights in China, have issued a joint declaration (see this newspaper on the 16th). In order to understand the facts, the reporter visited the authorities of each company. According to them, "Our company fully supports China's relief work since the signing of the Sino-British Treaty in 1943. Looking back on our operations since then, for six months, all the goods loaded were mainly relief supplies from CNRRA; and the routes sailed were also based on the needs of relief materials. Under the circumstances that the freight rate for relief supplies is lower than that for passengers and cargo, the company has been able to adhere to this principle unswervingly. Its hard work in safeguarding China's relief work and promoting China's economic recovery is clearly demonstrated."

#### Wenhui Daily Suspended for One Week
The Wenhui Daily was suspended yesterday. According to news released by the police station, "The Wenhui Daily usually publishes articles attacking security agencies, fabricating reasons, and so on. A few days ago, it published two letters from 'A Policeman' and 'An Inspector', which contained many fabricated facts, alienating emotions, and disrupting public order. After the bureau sent personnel to request to read the original manuscript, the newspaper failed to point out who submitted it, and used the name of the police to fabricate news, confusing the public. At this time of turbulent situation, security is of utmost importance, and it is absolutely not allowed to provoke discord and divide the strength of the military and police, which would hinder security. The bureau had no choice but to follow the order of the garrison headquarters and impose a one-week suspension on the newspaper in accordance with the Publication Law and the Martial Law."

#### Young and Inexperienced, Seeking Trouble for Oneself
A Murder Case Leads to Further Complications
Defamation Case Scheduled for Sentencing
[Our Newspaper's Report] On March 7 of this year, at 4:00 PM, when Shen Youqi was passing through the intersection of East Zhongzheng Road and Jiangxi Road, he was knocked down by a bicycle ridden by student Xu Peihuang. He was sent to the hospital and died. The family members of the deceased filed a lawsuit in court. The District Court sentenced Xu Peihuang to four months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence for the crime of negligent injury resulting in death. The defendant disagreed with the sentence and appealed to the High Court while writing a letter to a newspaper, pointing out that the family members of the deceased had negotiated with his father, Xu Shihui, to settle the case with 25 gold bars, and believed that the trial of the case in court was also unfair. After the article was published, the District Court and the family members of the deceased believed that it was suspected of insulting and defaming them, and the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution again. Shen Zhongxiqin, the wife of the deceased, also filed a private prosecution and filed a civil suit against Xu's father, requesting that he be punished according to the law and demanding that the full text of the judgment in this case be published in the newspaper for three days to admit his fault. Because it was the same case, the case was jointly tried by Judge Shen Tianbao in Criminal Division 4 of the District Court yesterday morning. After questioning, the verdict was scheduled for the morning of the 22nd.

#### Invited by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Staff Association
Mayor Wu Attends Lecture
Explaining Problems Such as Rice and Housing Allocation in Detail
[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu attended a lecture at the Duchen Hotel yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM at the invitation of the "UNRRA" Staff Association. Mr. Lei, the Director of the Far East Office of "UNRRA", and Mr. Luo, the Chairman of the Association, accompanied him. About 150 Chinese and foreign members attended. Mr. Lei praised Mayor Wu's wisdom, ability, and determination in administration, and stood up to introduce Mr. Wu's outstanding achievements in the past.

#### Grain Situation
Mayor Wu first reported on the grain situation in the city, stating briefly: The sources of rice supply in the city include about 300 rice merchants, more than 1,700 rice shops, and a small number of Chen farmers who transport rice from the suburbs. Since I took over the work in Shanghai on May 20, the most difficult thing I have encountered is dealing with the rice problem. According to the regulations, rice merchants should charge a commission of 2% when selling rice to rice shops, but in reality, rice merchants do not sell rice to rice shops but resell and hoard among themselves, raising prices. At the same time, some rice merchants set the price of each stone of rice at 70,000 yuan and charged a commission of 10%. After the municipal government conducted a rice registration, the results showed that there was a total of 430,000 dan of rice in storage, but it was not known whether the registration procedures were duplicated. Part of the rice was registered by the rice merchants or rice shops, and the rice mills registered again, resulting in an actual amount of only 300,000 dan. Five weeks ago, the price of rice soared. The municipal government could not control it because there was insufficient rice in storage. After requesting the allocation from the Grain and Resources Department, it has been temporarily resolved. Currently, the brown rice transported from Sichuan or Jiangxi is rich in vitamins, but when I first came to Shanghai, the city's workers were unwilling to buy brown rice, and the rice shops were unwilling to sell it. After compulsory enforcement, it has been adopted. Currently, if the city has 250,000 dan of rice per month, it is sufficient to cope, but at present, during the transition period, there is not much rice in storage in July, and civil servants, teachers, and workers must be assisted and supplied with low-priced rice. The price should not exceed 51,000 yuan (including profit and transportation costs), but for the propertied class who like to eat the best rice and do not care about the price, it can be slightly increased to 71,000 yuan per stone. After the new grain is launched in September of this year, all problems can be solved. Before the war, our country needed to import 1 million tons of foreign rice every year, so today we hope for the assistance of foreign rice. The United Nations Food Control Committee is not fair in the allocation of food. Malaysia, India, and other places do not have food shortages, but they are allocated a lot of food. Our country's food shortage is serious, but we only get 50,000 tons, which is incomprehensible. At the same time, I hope that the United Nations Food Committee can provide 10,000 tons of the fourth batch of 50,000 tons of rice allocated to China in July and 10,000 tons in August to meet urgent needs.

#### Dock Thieves
Mayor Wu also said that he has taken measures to deal with the petty thieves at the docks who steal incoming and outgoing goods, and will crack down on them. It will be implemented soon.

#### Housing Allocation
Regarding the issue of housing allocation, Mayor Wu reported that the US Consulate General and the US Navy have priority in allocating German overseas Chinese houses, and the "UNRRA" also has priority. The quantity and agencies allocated have a list for inspection. Laws are enacted to relocate German overseas Chinese, but because some houses are inhabited by German overseas Chinese, while others are Chinese or Americans, relocation is difficult. It is now stipulated that all leases signed before April 20 are invalid. Mayor Wu finally sincerely asked the "UNRRA" staff for assistance and cooperation and guaranteed to show the public with practical relief work. Chairman Luo immediately stood up to express his gratitude and replied that he would do his best to help China.

#### Military Law Department Interrogates Grain Merchants

The interrogation will continue this morning, and Wu Rongsheng of the Santai Rice Shop will be interrogated this afternoon.

#### Increasing Number of Refugees from Northern Jiangsu Arriving in Shanghai
Life Urgently Needs Relief
Yu Pu Talks About the General Work of the Temporary Relief Association
The number of refugees from northern Jiangsu fleeing to Shanghai is gradually increasing, and their lives urgently need relief. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang and Chairman of Jiangsu Province Wang Maogong have come to Shanghai several times to raise relief funds. Shanghai has also established a relief organization for refugees from northern Jiangsu, and under the enthusiastic leadership of Zhu Hua and Gu Zhuhong, work has been actively launched. Yesterday, the reporter visited Yu Pu, the person in charge of the Shanghai Temporary Relief Committee for Refugees from Northern Jiangsu, and asked about the current situation of the association's general work. The report is as follows:

#### Relief Organization Divided into Three Agencies
The relief organization for refugees from northern Jiangsu is divided into three agencies: (1) The Shanghai Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference. The general agency is located in Zhenjiang, presided over by various ministers and Chairman Wang, and is responsible for refugee relief assessment, distribution, and supervision. It is the highest relief agency. Zhu Hua and Gu Zhuqi are the main and deputy directors of the Shanghai Office. (2) The Shanghai Temporary Relief Committee for Refugees from Northern Jiangsu. The association was initiated by the Jiangbei Shanghai Fellow Countrymen Service Society and has been approved by the Executive Yuan Rehabilitation and Relief Administration to distribute relief materials. Zhu Hua also serves as the chief standing committee member of the association. The association is divided into five groups: general affairs, registration, service, condolence, and storage, which are responsible for refugee registration, job placement, small loans, and storage of youth relief materials. It is an organization that actually carries out relief tasks. (3) The Shanghai Branch of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. The general association is located in Zhenjiang, and Chairman Wang serves as the chairman. Zhu Hua, chairman of the Shanghai Branch, also serves concurrently. His job is to assist the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Temporary Relief Committee in handling various matters that should be handled.

#### Unable to Make a Living and Becoming Beggars
Since its establishment on June 3, the Shanghai Temporary Relief Committee for Refugees from Northern Jiangsu has conducted two registrations. The first registration was from June 19 to 21, and the second was from July 9 to 11. A total of more than 40,000 refugees were registered. In terms of origin, Yancheng has the most refugees, and Xuhai has the fewest. In terms of occupation, farmers account for one-half, and workers and small businessmen account for one-half. In addition, there are more than 1,700 unemployed and out-of-school youth. These people in Shanghai are unable to make a living, and it is difficult for them to provide for their own food and clothing. There are quite a few who have become beggars. The number of refugees who have not registered with the association cannot be counted.

#### Insufficient Relief Supplies
The relief materials received by the association so far only include 4,000 shi of flour donated by the First Supply Area of the Logistics Command, 400,000 jin of red beans and peas, 200,000 jin of corn, and a small amount of other grains. Recently, the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference in Zhenjiang began to allocate 200 tons of flour from CNRRA relief, which has not yet arrived. The relief donations only include 100 million yuan remitted by the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, accounting for one-fortieth of the total relief donations of the association (the relief funds for Northern Jiangsu refugees, in addition to the 200 million yuan allocated by the government, Shanghai has also raised 200 million yuan, totaling 400 million yuan). In addition, in order to conduct a small loan, 12 million yuan was temporarily borrowed from the Jiangsu Farmers Bank and the Jiangsu Provincial Bank. The small amount feels like a drop in the bucket, and it is difficult to distribute.

#### Overall Planning for Practical Results
As for how to distribute it, the association plans to hand over the materials to various fellow countryman associations in northern Jiangsu, including the Jianghuai Fellow Countryman Association, the Tongru Chonghai Fellow Countryman Association, the Yangshu Seven Counties Fellow Countryman Association, the Haishu Four Counties City Fellow Countryman Association, and the Baoying Fellow Countryman Association. Based on the number of registered people, the association will make overall arrangements for relief. In addition to flour, the association has made the grain donated by the Logistics Department into mixed flour, all bagged, and will issue it. In addition to the small loan of 12 million yuan, the cash part of 100 million yuan will be directly distributed by the association to students who are studying and unemployed and out-of-school youth for relief. It has not yet been specifically decided how much each person can get and according to what standard to distribute. Recently, Northern Jiangsu students who stayed in school during the summer vacation at various universities have successively applied for relief, and the association is investigating and reviewing them separately. In short, the association was established to relieve refugees from Northern Jiangsu, and every drop will be given to all refugees. However, how to achieve the principle of fairness and universality and truly solve the refugees' livelihood difficulties requires guidance and assistance from people in the association and fellow countryman from Northern Jiangsu to achieve practical results.

Publishing World's Yellow Publications Revived!
Dangerous Words

In the recent past, the city government made a firm determination to thoroughly cleanse this city of some poisonous yellow publications. The so-called poisonous elements refer to those containing obscene inquiries, theft, and fabricated rumors. Shanghai, in China, can be considered a culturally advanced metropolis. However, this so-called culture represents a petty-bourgeois culture. Tastes are quite low. The psychology of the general petty bourgeoisie is that they have some spare time to kill and are willing to spend a little money, and the places they enjoy most are those of sensuality and extravagance. Some yellow publications arise to meet this need.

The publication of publications that have a segment of searches is originally a cause for celebration in cultural undertakings. At the same time, to develop culture in a society, one fears that no one is cultivating this spirit-like undertaking, even more fears that there are no masses to support it. Therefore, we feel that the publication of small publications is not a bad thing in itself. However, many publications in Shanghai often only seek to cater to low-level tastes, maintain the sales of the publications, and do not hesitate to report on scandals and social trends. It still has a negative impact on public sentiment. Therefore, the city government is determined to clean it up, which is indeed a good policy.

In recent days, we have seen these yellow publications revived on newsstands. Of course, this has already been permitted by the municipal party authorities. Fortunately, we are not against the publication of publications by Shanghai's cultural circles in principle, but we hope that these listed publications will also improve the level of interest and use a relaxed and interesting style to propagate everything related to international or domestic political, economic, and social situations in a positive and detailed manner. As for exposing the darkness of society and commenting on the gains and losses of common politics, this is not impossible, but the arguments must be absolutely responsible, and the motives must be completely pure. As for the authorities in charge of publishing management, on the one hand, they must respect the people's freedom of speech, and on the other hand, they must pay attention to their content, and strive for their success as a beneficial educational tool. I hope that the officials will not only pay attention to the legal procedures.

### Me and Education
Zhang Wenyu
Original by Shu Xincheng
Published by Zhonghua Book Company, First Edition in Early February of the 35th Year

"Me and Education" is an autobiographical work in which the author uses 200,000 words to describe his educational and writing life from 1893 to 1928. We first analyze it from the perspective of modern Chinese history. From 1893 to 1928 was a period when Chinese culture turned from old-fashioned construction to innovation and westernization. Whether from political economy, thought, or academic aspects, it was a period of great change. The author's childhood and adolescence were spent in such a historical background. He heard, saw, and personally experienced the educational environment of the time, and put these situations into medicine. This medicine is not only the author's autobiography, but also reflects the educational situation at the time and the general public's concept of education.

Why did the author write this book? The author said in the "Preface": "All educational events related to my personal life, educational experience, educational insights, educational ideals, and educational methods, as well as personal educational experience, can be freely told for everyone to criticize." (December of the 20th year) The author wrote in "After Finishing Writing": "I now want to use literary descriptive methods to write several "Me and What" to express my entire life in childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and middle age." (July of the 30th year) He also said in "A Small Note Before Printing": "I have been living on writing for more than 30 years. I think what I can leave to society is only writing. I still have this ambition today and plan to devote my remaining years to writing in order to complete this wish!" (January of the 35th year)

The author was born in May 1893 and grew up in a small agricultural society permeated with feudal thoughts. His mother wanted him to study and achieve fame. Before the age of five, he entered a private school in his hometown—Liujia Ferry, Shupu, Hunan. There were several changes in his private school life, from Liujia Private School to Hu Family School, Yilongwangjiang Private School, Huilongge Private School, and Zhang Family School. Finally, his private school life transformed into a academy life - Lang School. In the autumn of 1908, because the academy was changed into a school, the author bid farewell to the academy and transferred to the county-level higher elementary school. During his high school days, the author participated in the elementary school teacher examination and worked as an elementary school teacher. In 1911, the winter of the year of the Wuchang Uprising, the author married Ms. He Juduan. After the founding of the Republic of China, he entered Changde Second Normal School in the first year of the Republic of China. In the spring of the same year, he entered the preparatory course for studying abroad in Changsha, and in the summer of the same year, he entered Wenchang Middle School in Wuchang. In the autumn of the same year, he transferred to Yuelu Higher Normal School. The author ended his student life after four years in Yuelu. The author's teacher life began with a trial in the summer of 1911. At that time, he was expelled from the high school due to the revolution, and he had no choice but to teach gymnastics and arithmetic in the school. But it really started in the spring of 1917 when he taught music in Duize Middle School. In the summer of 1918, the Hunan Education Association held a summer training class, and the author served as an education instructor, which was the beginning of the author's research on education. The author's initial influences were Thorndike's "Educational Psychology" and Dewey's "Democracy and Education". After the end of the summer school, he was transferred to the post of director of academic affairs and education teacher at Fuxiang Girls' School, which was run by the church at that time, and it was at this time that the foundation for educational writing was laid. At this time, the author had educational experience, and the interest in academic research was also flourishing. At the same time, the environment of the times also gave the author some influence, because the May Fourth Movement came, and the New Culture Movement gave the author a great stimulus. In November 1919, he resigned from his position at Fuxiang and engaged in writing in Changsha from June 1920, preparing for the "Hunan Education Monthly". Soon, due to the chaos of the political situation in Hunan, he went to Shanghai. Two months after arriving in Shanghai, the Hunan Provincial First Normal School hired him as a teacher of education. He only stayed in Hunan First Normal School for one year. In September 1921, he came to Shanghai again to serve as the director of the middle school of China Public School. He encountered two disturbances in the school. In 1922, the author and ten colleagues in Zhonggong Middle School did a lot of things: (1) Implementing a five-year ability grouping system and elective system, (2) Implementing a six-year new school system, (3) Implementing a counseling system for moral education, (4) Implementing a non-work system for physical education, (5) Setting up subject classrooms, (6) Adopting the Dalton system for teaching, (7) Implementing coeducation. In February 1923, the author's family still lived in Nanjing, engaged in academic research and writing for a living, and spent a period of lecturing, so as to visit several secondary educational institutions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and the Yangtze River basin. In October 1924, the author was hired by the National Chengdu Higher Normal School and traveled east to Sichuan to serve as a professor in the Department of Education. In the spring and summer of the following year, he encountered danger in a "teacher-student love" case and left Chengdu very embarrassedly, returning to Shanghai, thus ending his teacher life. The author's writing life began in November 1919, when he wrote some "Notes" and tried to write novels, creating two books, "Snow-covered Bloodstains" and "Field Records". The beginning of educational writing was in the summer of 1919, when he compiled "Psychological Principles and Practical Education". In the summer of 1922, the "Educational Psychology" compiled by the author based on Thorndike's educational psychology was published by the Commercial Press. In May 1923, "Introduction to Psychology" was published by Zhonghua Book Company. In August of the same year, the "Civics Textbook" was published by Hua Publishing House. In 1924, he completed the book "Philosophy of Life". The author is famous for introducing the Dalton system. There are four books about the Dalton system: "Overview of the Dalton System" in May 1923, "Collection of Discussions on the Dalton System" in March 1924, "Research on the Wilton System" in June of the same year, and "A Brief Explanation of the Dalton System" in June of the same year (all published by Zhonghua). In December 1993, Zhonghua published Thorndike's original "On Individuality" translated by the author, and in October 1924, Zhonghua published Moore's original "The Trend of Modern Psychology" translated by the author. In October 1925, "First Draft of Education" was published by Zhonghua. In 1927, "Shu Jin Xin Ying" was written. All of the above are named as side jobs by Zhu Ming. So, what is the main job? The author's ideal and plan is: "To create a private college where students can live by their own labor, work together, and encourage each other." In order to establish the college, the author planned to use the income from writing as a tool to solve the financial problems. However, the author's ideal was never completed, and the college was not established. After taking office as the director of the editorial office of Zhonghua Book Company on New Year's Day in 1930, he could only work hard in editing and publishing. However, the writings on education were continuously published by Zhonghua; he translated Burkehurst's "Individual Homework and Dao Liangdun System" (1925), "A Chinese Education Dictionary" (1928), "Zhonghua Zhike Cihuang" (1930). "General Theory of Education" (1926), "Modern Education Methods" (1930 - Commercial), "Historical Materials of Modern Chinese Education" (1926), "Overview of New Education in China" (1927), "Education Guide" (1925-1926), "History of Studying Abroad in Modern China" (1927), "History of Educational Thought in Modern China" (19129), and some other educational papers. This is the author's educational writing life.

This autobiographical work narrates 35 years of educational life, reflects on the society, reveals the truth, and provides an objective historical description of the development of new education in China. We should not regard it as a personal autobiography. The author's understanding of life, which embodies a kind of "unlimited self-awareness and creation," is especially worth experiencing. If you have read boring educational historical materials and other books and want to find a novel, interesting, and valuable modern educational history book, I am very willing to recommend this book.

### Children of the New Era
Ping

Arnold Gesell, Francis L. Ilg and Others: Infant and Child in the Culture of Today. New York The Macmillan Macmillan Coillan Co, pp 399, 1943, 14.00

This book uses a popular and clear text to describe the psychological development of children from birth to the age of five. The book is accompanied by 65 pictures to illustrate the process of behavioral development in the first five years of life. The authors divide this process into twelve stages. Each stage has a chart showing its characteristics and development trends, which makes it easy to understand. The chart is based on the professional facts obtained from measurement results and provides many practical guidelines for people who look after children. Behind each chart is a "Behavior of the Day" section, which details how to take care of the child's sleep, diet, excretion, etc. at this stage.

These twelve charts of behavioral development, when we read them in order, show that the publication of human beings is a continuous series. This explanation can greatly help us to actually manage children. At the same time, it can enable us to obtain a more important conclusion - that is, the special defense of a child's early development can enable us to see the tendency of his life. The authors advocate that family affairs are a kind of cultural work. If we manage him according to each child's own characteristics and needs, we can cultivate a democratic lifestyle. The family is the base for the development of each person's personality. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the development of children in the first year. After 18 months, the child's behavior develops outward and exceeds the boundaries of the family. At this time, the child may have to be sent to a nursery. Therefore, the authors discuss the various aspects of nurseries in detail here.

The book ends with an appendix listing the toys that children at each stage may play with, and giving child guidance workers many books, notes, and materials on how to guide brothers and sisters. This book is the compass for cultivating children in the new era, and it makes a great contribution to mothers and nurses in nurseries.

### Nanyang and Northwest
Wang Chengzhu

(Published in the third year by Zhengzhong Book Company and other distributors. Northwestern Regional Geography was first published in Chongqing by the Commercial Press in the 34th year and published in Shanghai in the 35th year.) Therefore, the writing styles of the two books are naturally similar. The collection of various geographical data on Nanyang and the Northwest is quite rich, so it is very convenient for general reference. At the end of the Northwest book, there is also a detailed bibliography. The whole book adopts a regional narrative, and the categories described in each region are roughly the same. Therefore, it is especially suitable for the use of classification and reading.

The Northwest is an important part of our country's frontier, and Nanyang is a region of increasing reproduction, which are of vital importance to us. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the various situations in these areas. The situation in these two areas is still in motion after the war. Some of what is described in the book has inevitably become outdated. However, this is not a problem, because major political changes are usually easy to pay attention to. As for economic changes, the future trend is difficult to stabilize for a while. We can only use the previous materials as a basis for comparative research. Due to the difficulty of printing, the illustrations could not be reproduced and printed, which is a pity. However, in the geographical works of zoning, the boundary demarcation of zoning is an indispensable reference basis.隙 Jun in Nanyang Geography has detailed zoning maps for several districts in Nanyang, which is very convenient. However, readers should use more detailed maps, especially topographic maps, to refer to them carefully in order to understand the true meaning of zoning. In the Northwest book, in addition to the general map of zoning, although many parts of the book use a more detailed division within each district, there is no map to show it, which is a defect.

Perhaps it is because the authors wanted to avoid the general readers feeling bored, so the two books are very brief in their description of the root of the division. At the same time, the academic discussion and conclusion on the zoning characteristics of various geographical landscapes and their causes are only occasionally seen. However, for general readers, if you just want to check the various situations in the valley.

Recently, I saw the two regions of Rain Wood, one is Nanyang Geography, and the other is Northwestern Regional Geography, both of which are works by Mr. Chen Zhengxiang of Central University. (According to the postscript of the Nanyang Geography book, it was completed at the end of 1990, but the first edition that was exempted from publication was quite extensive. The Nanyang book has a few place names and academic terms. It is probably inconvenient for readers who are not sincere.)

There is a lot of interesting material in the book. For example, regarding the production of Yige in the Philippines, it is surprising that the quality of the lower reaches of the Caga Valley (this article does not use the name Mis, which is an example) near the sea is not as good as that in the middle of the valley, because the tobacco will reduce its fragrance and irritation because it is blown by the sea breeze. Regarding the grassland area south of Dagemo, Pan Cui is making progress, but it is inevitable that it will be in vain over time, and instead, it will be greeted by stricter animal management. These are all important issues in land use. The Northwestern book pays attention to the valley area development plan, and all those who are concerned about the development of the Northwest should be interested in it.

Some of the information seems to be slightly problematic. For example, in the Nanyang book, the organization of the Malay states is explained very briefly, and the average reader may not be able to understand the difference in their political status. Regarding the sugarcane in Java, the vicissitudes of the past ten years or so seem to be ignored. The unit of the same kind of material is either in metric tons or in metric dan, which is not uniform, and I am afraid that it is easy for readers to misunderstand, and the cited numbers seem to be slightly doubtful. It is too negligent to not mention the British territories in the South Seas Islands.

In the Northwestern book, the information on natural geography is more abundant. This is obviously due to the fact that the investigation by experts from various countries has always been more focused on the natural aspects, while the information on the human aspects is inevitably scattered, or focused on the same part. However, there are also many interesting issues, such as the historical climate change in the Daoyi area, or the loss of the Tashumu River waterway and its impact. The average person thinks that the situation in the Northwest is so simple that there is not much to say, but this book can be regarded as a good counter-evidence.

### Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Educational Thought
Zhu Jiaqing
Author: Zhang Zhizhi
Published by Zhengxiao Book Company

Our country is caught in a maze of complex educational trends, and is in a state of bewilderment and frustration. To save our country's current educational crisis, we should sincerely establish an educational philosophy that adapts to our country's national policy - how to extract a constructive educational ideological system from our country's national spirit. China takes the Three People's Principles as the highest principle for building the country, so we should have an educational theory that conforms to this highest principle as a cornerstone for building a new China.

This article introduces the book "Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Educational Thought" written by Zhang Zhizhi. This book is a part of the educational part extracted from Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's ideological system. Although the entire book is only 88 pages, it fully develops the essence of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's educational thought. It is indeed a compass for those of us who are responsible for violating the country's mission, studying educational thought, and engaging in educational work. Therefore, the content is briefly described as follows:

1.  The reason for the failure of modern Chinese education - the lack of a consistent central policy in education, the lack of a consistent education system, and the incompatibility with our country's political, economic, and social background: these are the crux of the failure of the implementation of new education. Our country has suffered from the coercion of the great powers in the past and has learned a painful lesson; only then did we realize that education must be changed. Therefore, there are various kinds of "local education" and "national defense education," which are numerous and varied. Because there is no consistent central policy, there is no consistent education system. As a result, educational laws and regulations change in the morning and evening, and educational forms change in the morning and evening, which is extremely chaotic. At the same time, since we have admitted that politics, economy, society, and education have a deep relationship, then we can deduce that: the goal of education is the goal of politics; the central idea of education is also the central idea of politics. Since the realization of the Three People's Principles has been set by the National Father as the political goal of our country, we cannot study Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's educational thought without studying our country's educational goal.

2.  The basic spirit of the Three People's Principles - In terms of nationalism in Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's educational thought: Patriotic education must fully perceive the mission entrusted to it by the nation - Extending our country's inherent culture; at the same time, it must strengthen its common sense of identity, unite the power of the nation, and restore its national status. Of course, the first task of national education is to cultivate the national spirit, preserve and promote our country's inherent culture and general morality; then strengthen its common consciousness, unite its national power, and ultimately achieve the restoration of national status. In terms of democracy: it is advocated that education should be aimed at the whole people, not at the class; popular education must be promoted to realize the ideal of equal educational opportunities; and the will to fight for democracy and the knowledge and ability to exercise and use the right to vote must be cultivated. In terms of people's livelihood: it is advocated that education should first understand the process of industrial evolution. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen said; "People's livelihood is the center of social evolution; social evolution is the center of history." The meaning of this sentence should be thoroughly understood and universally promoted today. Secondly, we should understand the elements of human life: that is, the research on the production and consumption of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other aspects. Thirdly, we know that the ultimate goal of human consumption is still production: and people's livelihood education is a kind of production education, which should of course pay attention to the cultivation of all-round knowledge and ability, and the knowledge and ability to make a living are important tools for making a living, so it is also the biggest goal of education.

3.  The theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy - We want to make everyone serve as the purpose, then the two aspects of "knowing" and "doing" of the activity of serving must be discussed. From this, we can see that Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy is not only a kind of psychological construction, but also a kind of educational construction. The achievement of the theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy is modern. There are two differences between modern and ancient times: (1) Modern times are the world of science (2) Modern times are the era of human association. Therefore, the theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy can also be called "scientific" or "social". We call it scientific because it has scientific basis in psychology and physiology. At the same time, the theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy is social, because it also has sociological basis. "Because knowing is difficult but doing is easy, everyone should do it and publicize it all the time, because doing comes before knowing, everyone should seek knowledge in practice. This educational theory coincides with the experimental educational theory of Dr. 社威博 (J. Dewey). Dr. Dewey wants us to "learn from practice," which is exactly the methodology of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's educational thought.

In short, the educational theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy is a "pragmatic educational theory". The pragmatic educational theory takes "doing" as the beginning and "doing" as the end of the educational process. The epistemology of pragmatism is also the instrumentalism of knowledge: it is believed that "knowing" is only a tool of "doing". At the same time, the educational theory of knowing is difficult but doing is easy or pragmatism, on the one hand, it is to encourage people to explore the truth in actual life based on their natural abilities and use rich truth to enrich the content of actual life. On the other hand, it is also necessary to use the function of will to lay the foundation for action; so that the action will not be interrupted and reach the ultimate goal. This is what Dr. Sun Yat-Sen said: "Those who have aspirations will succeed."

### Write Something for the Children
Zhu Li

By the alley, at the corner of the vegetable market, you often see a group of children surrounding a book stall, reading with great interest. What are they reading? Some are precocious erotic stories, some are adult life stories, some are stories of knights and immortals.... These books have vulgar words and crude pictures. Friends of Open Education see this and feel that "this is a problem of children's education". How will these low-level, bizarre, and chaotic readings affect the innocent children? -- They are absorbing things that they should not and cannot understand in the development of their physiology and psychology. This induces harmful precocity in them, and when they are not clear about what is right and wrong in the current situation, they are asked to vaguely absorb some right and wrong things. Therefore, some children want to learn to be immortals, some children hope to be heroes who use flying swords every day, and some children want to be majestic emperors. How are these readings with words and pictures carrying out their sexual education!

We cannot prohibit children from reading these harmful readings. At the same time, these readings still have their uses for a certain class of society: "Killing time when bored". Then, what should we do? -- We hope that friends who care about children's education and children's culture will really do something for the children and compile some readings for the children. Naturally, these readings should focus on the meaning of education, but cannot lack literary interest. We hope to produce some children's psychology-friendly and interesting words and picture books. Comic books are a good form. In today's very depressed publishing industry, whether publishers dare to try is certainly a problem, but we must know that the number of child readers will not be less than the young people and adults who love new literature.

### Rambling Talk on "Spring in Beiwang Garden"
Zheng Jia Huan

In early spring this year, the third issue of the Universe magazine published a short story that was quite "not short"! The title is "Spring in Beiwang Garden", and the author is "Lu Binji"! This word is very unfamiliar to me; but this work of his has left a very good impression: there is a unique writing style, fluent, slow, and full of intimacy when reading.

After that, I mentioned it to a few friends. Besides knowing that Lu Binji is a new young writer in the rear, we also had different views on that short story; some people thought: their style is very outstanding, but it is a pity that the depiction of small details is too focused on the protagonist, which is unavoidable; others said: although he can give us a novel feeling in this novel, if he continues to write according to the old format, this is very difficult for the author himself. My friends may all be as superficial as I am when appreciating literary works! He added criticism based on his own feelings and prejudices, and only paid attention to the achievements in skills, neglecting the content; such an absolutely unobjective attitude, the review can be rewarded, however, in fact, we all prefer this story.

Three months later, I accidentally discovered a small square book on the newsstand. On the white cover, there was a green pattern, and the words "Spring in Beiwang Garden" were written in bright red letters. This is Lu Binji's collection of short novels! I was so happy, I hurried to buy it back and read it all night; only then did I realize that Lu Binji is not the gentle and beautiful author that we imagined. He can also use straightforward and stubborn writing to write some painful and ugly stories, which are shocking:

The short novel collection "Spring in Bei Guan" has about 80,000 words and contains ten stories; (1) The meaning of life; (2) Children of peasant families; (3) Neighbors - Kang Tiangang, (4) Spring in Bei Yuan; (5) The story of red glass; (6) The story of old men, (7) The incident in 1944; (8) A frank man's confession; (9) The old maid; (10) He Huojie's house.

Among them, "Children of Peasant Families", "Neighbors - He Quangang" and "The Story of Red Glass" are all based on the border area between Guandong, Russia and Korea, so the local color is very strong. This is rarely seen in ordinary works; perhaps the author himself grew up there since childhood, and has a clear and deep understanding of the customs, lifestyles, and generational tragedies of that place, so it is particularly vivid to write.

In addition, the background of the remaining seven stories is to describe the anecdotes of many small people in the rear towns during the Anti-Japanese War; during that difficult and painful period, people were confined in a small cage, without joy, living in boredom, and then silently depressed! They spent their days in "disputes" and "hatred," enduring confusion, sighs, and anger; their spirits suffered incurable numbness and disability; and some people died like this because they could not bear the pressure! The masters in "Spring in Bei Yuan" could not find some clear periods, warmth, and "spring" full of floral fragrance!

In Lu Binji's novels, there are no tortuous legends, no "preaching tone", no "new literary tone", no "strong gunpowder smell", no "great love", and no "roses". What he presents are all ordinary things, the most real dynamics of life; containing a faint sadness and misfortune. Sometimes, he is also willing to make the atmosphere in the story very quiet and beautiful, but under these bright things, disappointment and sorrow are revealed even more cruelly.... The protagonists in those stories may be the friends you have seen around you, or one of them may be your own shadow; in the past, you may have been worried about yourself and washed away your tears, but now, the sky in your heart has gradually become darker, their tired and haggard figures have become blurred, only their stumbling steps are slowly stepping on your heart...

Lu Binji has a very unique and tactful writing style. We can see one or two from the following short paragraph: "...Today is July 1st, what should the summer in Beiwang Garden, Guilin be like? Is Lin Meina still digging for earthworms? If her difficulty has grown up, then what is she doing in the afternoon when she is sleeping? She never reads books or magazines, so isn't there a blank in her life? Will she feel empty during this blank period...? In fact, the male and female guests in Beiwang Garden will not be lonely when they are carefree. They will also sit on the corridor and make pure sounds - in the living room of the red tile house, the flowers of the puli flower in the vase must not be small for their happiness, and there may also be Zhu Qiuhua palms! I miss Beiwang Gang, I miss the late night in Beiwang Garden... Zhao Renjie must still be sitting in his dark room, imagining... Now there should be a piece of frog noise in the late night in Beiwang Garden."

Spring has already passed, do you miss it? Why not lower your head and look at "Spring in Beiwang Garden"! It may bring you some news! Let you think for a moment in the quiet poem.

Hauptmann Died in Spring and Autumn
Zhao Jingshen

According to reports, the great German playwright Hauptmann passed away in his hometown of Silesia in mid-June. He was born in 1862 and died at the age of eighty-five.

Hauptmann's plays do not seem to have been staged in our country, and there do not seem to be any adapted translations. However, in the early days of the New Literature Movement, there were many introductions to Hauptmann's plays.

I remember that there were two translations by Yang Bingchen in the World Series of the Commercial Press, one was "The Beaver Coat" and the other was "The Sunken Bell". Later, Chen Jiakai translated "The Weavers", which has long been out of print by the Commercial Press. The "Lonely People" translated by Miao Guoren was also published by the Commercial Press. "The Sunken Bell" translated by Sun Pu was published by Kaiming. This is his representative work combining symbolism and naturalism. Almost every country has a translation. One of the earliest literary groups in our country even used "The Sunken Bell" as the name of the society. Lin Ruji, Chen Wu, Feng Zhi and others were all members of the society. In terms of novels, there is also "The Heretic of Sanara" translated by Wang Shiwei, published by Zhonghua; "The Heretic" translated by Guo Moruo is another translation of this novel.

There are no special books on Hauptmann's research in our country, but there are four articles cited in the sixth issue of the thirteenth volume of the Novel Monthly. If they are printed in a single volume, they can also become a small book of nearly 30,000 words. These four articles are "Biography of Hauptmann", "Naturalistic Works of Hauptmann", "Symbolistic Works of Hauptmann" and "Hauptmann and Nietzsche's Philosophy". Xizhen Huo is probably the pseudonym of Shen Yanbing (Mao Dun). Liu Dajie's "Outline of German Literature" (Beixin) also has a detailed introduction to Hauptmann. The Hauptmann part in "Modern World Writers on Nobel Prize Money Winners" (Han Jiao Zhengkai Printing House) by Ms. Yang Jikan (seemingly Yang Jiang) is based on Liu's book. A book similar to Yang Shan's is "Nobel Prize in Literature" by Lv Shi Xiao, which also has Hauptmann's chapter. In addition, what can be provided to us for reference are Jin Xiangsen's three works: "History of German Literature" (Literature Industry. Commercial Press), "Prepared German Literature" (Encyclopedia Series. Commercial Press), and "Modern German Literary Trends" (People's Library. Huatong). Zhang Chuanpu, a graduate of German from Peking University, once wrote "Outline of the History of German Literature" (Zhonghua). Li Jinfa's "German Literature ABC" also translated a section of "The Weavers". Jiang Qifan's "Modern Writers" and Sun Lianggong's "Biographies of World Writers" also have Hauptmann's outline. The list of these book names can not only be used for the study of Hauptmann, but also for literary enthusiasts who do not understand Western languages to study German literature.

It is a pity that Hauptmann's earliest play "Before Sunrise" has never been translated. I wonder if there were any translations in the rear during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. There are not many English reference books at hand. Roberson's "German Literature" (Family University Books) said: "The sign of the most promising new life can be found in Berlin, which is the Independent Theater, which was established in imitation of the French Free Theater. This theater began in 1888, and the first play was Ibsen's "Ghosts", which was considered the most powerful play of the era by young revolutionaries in the 1980s; after "Ghosts" was the first work of German writer Hauptmann, "Before Sunrise". ...It is not easy to make a conclusion about Hauptmann. The difficulty lies in his tendency to change constantly. He has tried various literary forms, especially drama, more than any writer of the same era. He is easily influenced by others. He is influenced on the one hand, but he also has a strong personality, which is contradictory. For example, he initially wrote very realistic dramas, and later he and his contemporaries were influenced by the Scandinavians, and the result was "The Weavers", the most powerful drama of the first period of the literary revival. Later, when the new mysticism swept through Europe, almost uprooting realism, Hauptmann was fascinated by the new mysticism. In "Hannele's Ascension", he created a new fairy tale drama, combining realism and fantasy, written very delicately. "The Sunken Bell" is almost a allegorical poem. What returned to a more solid realistic basis was "Teamster Henlier" and "Rosenband". Hauptmann walked his own way, often evading the critics' wishes. He lived sharply in the trend of thought, but, to be honest, he was not as successful as his previous works. It is doubtful whether Hauptmann's recent plays can leave some traces in the history of German drama. In his later years, he turned to novels. His strange new world's first story, "The Madman in Kuinte Monastery", is undeniably full of imagination."

Roberson's words seem to be fair. But Thomas's "History of German Literature" (One Yuan Belt Books) is inevitably biased. Thomas seems to be in the same boat as the Restorationists. But because he took the opportunity to introduce the situation of "Before Sunrise", it is also translated below:

"It is generally acknowledged that the important representative of German naturalism is Hauptmann, who is the debater of the new creed. However, his debate is not very perfect. He has no abstract lessons, no artistic skills, but pathological

### Full Text of Byrnes's Speech (Continued)

I confess that before the meeting in April I had little hope of an agreement being reached; after the April meeting, I had even less hope. At present, the prospects for the five countries to conclude peace treaties are bright. Ninety days after the ratification of these treaties, the occupying forces must withdraw, except for those protecting transportation lines. At that time, the people of the occupied countries will be able to breathe the air of freedom and live the life of free people. We are now returning to the path of peace, and I do not want to hide from the American people the disputes and difficulties that the four governments have encountered in harmonizing their opinions on these treaties. If we and our allies acknowledge the fundamental differences in our concepts, standards, and methods, we will ultimately have a better chance of solving our problems.

German and Austrian Issues: Although this conference made genuine progress on the peace issues of Italy and its satellite countries, it made no progress on the issues of Germany and Austria. Perhaps the time spent on the discussion was not in vain, because our experience has proven that our understanding with our Soviet friends cannot be achieved overnight. We must go through a series of debates, repeat our positions, and reaffirm our stance. I firmly believe that the Soviet Union finds it difficult to understand us, just as we find it difficult to understand the Soviet Union; but sometimes I think that our Soviet friends are deeply afraid that if they agree to everything we need without arguing, we will see them as weak, so they have to deliberately obstruct us. However, constant disputes are not conducive to a world that hopes for lasting peace. The Soviet Union began discussing the German issue with a pre-prepared statement. Our proposed draft treaty was to guarantee the continued disarmament of Germany for at least 25 years, but the Soviet statement insisted on opposing a treaty guaranteeing Germany's non-aggression against the Soviet Union and the security of Europe. I do not think the Soviet Union can understand the suspicion that its cold and hostile attitude has caused in the minds of friendly countries. The US's proposal to jointly guarantee the continued disarmament of Germany was a sincere suggestion to address the Soviet Union's concerns about security. If the US had been a party to this guarantee after World War I, World War II would not have occurred, and the Soviet Union would not have been attacked and ravaged. How could German militarism be used as a pawn in the struggle between East and West? How could German militarism be allowed to gain the opportunity to defeat its enemies one by one again? The Soviet side claimed that our proposed treaty was inappropriate and could not guarantee the elimination of German Nazism and the promotion of democracy, nor could it guarantee compensation to the Soviet Union; but these are all political issues that have already been discussed in the Potsdam Agreement.

Military Agreements: The military agreement we concluded on June 5, 1946, stipulated the immediate disarmament of the German army and the destruction of its war factories' military capabilities. Our proposed 25-year treaty was intended to ensure that once Germany was disarmed, we would ensure that it would not rearm. We do not understand why the Soviet Union opposes it? Especially since Marshal Stalin had already expressed his agreement in principle on this matter on December 24th last year.

The Soviet representative said that he had received reports that the disarmament work in the British occupation zone had not been implemented. The British representative said that according to reports, German factories in the Soviet occupation zone were still operating. We requested the Control Council to investigate these reports and verify them. The British and French representatives agreed to this approach, but the Soviet side did not agree to the investigation unless the investigation was limited to disarmament. I did point out at the beginning of the Paris Conference that the disarmament of Germany was only one part of the work to solve the German problem. At that time, I suggested, and at the most recent meeting I suggested again, that each country appoint representatives to promote the work of solving all the problems related to Germany. The British and French governments agreed to this suggestion, but the Soviet Union opposed it. The Soviet Union suggested that a special conference should be convened to discuss the German issue, and I expressed my agreement to it and insisted on confirming the date of this conference. However, based on my experience with the Italian and Balkan issues, I am deeply afraid that if the Soviet Union does not send representatives to maintain close contact with the foreign ministers and devote themselves to studying the points of agreement and disagreement, then the foreign ministers' exchange of fragmented opinions on the German issue will still be insufficient. We no longer need to hide the fact that, from the military point of view of each power, the four-power zoning control of Germany is not a perfect solution.

Economic Aspects: According to the Potsdam Declaration, in economic terms, Germany should be a whole, and we should establish a central management department to achieve this goal. However, in reality, Germany has been divided into four regions, and the movement, trade, and ideas between the people of each region have been strictly restricted, which is even more severe than between independent countries. As a result, each region has difficulty being self-sufficient, and we are spending $200 million a year in the US-occupied area. Although we and other occupying countries have undertaken a heavy financial burden, Germany is still threatened by inflation and economic paralysis. This situation will not continue. At the Paris Conference, we suggested instructing the Control Council to establish a central administrative agency to manage Germany as an economic unit and to prepare a plan for the exchange of products and the balance of imports and exports in each region. The French government, which had previously opposed the establishment of a central administrative agency, expressed its willingness to accept our suggestion. The UK also expressed its agreement, but the Soviet Union said that it could not agree to exclude the Saar region, so it could not proceed. I stated that we were unwilling to share responsibility for the economic paralysis of Germany and the inevitable suffering that would result from it, so I announced the final solution: we are prepared to manage our occupied area as an economic unit.

US Suggestions: I have explained that we have recently obtained cooperation from the British and Soviet occupied areas on some issues. I explained that our suggestion was not to divide Germany, but to make it one. I said: Any agreement made with one government can be joined by other governments under the same conditions if they are prepared to participate. The UK said that they would consider our suggestion and expressed the hope that they could agree to it; but the Soviet Union and France did not express their opinions. Our military representatives in Germany will receive instructions this week to cooperate with any one or all of the three governments on various important administrative matters, such as finance, transportation, communication, trade, and industry. Finally, we discussed the Austrian issue. On June 1, I issued a draft treaty recognizing Austria's independence and stipulating the withdrawal of the occupying forces. The British side submitted the draft for discussion, and I requested the appointment of representatives from the foreign ministers to draft the treaty. The Soviet side put forward two counter-proposals: (1) Take further action to ensure the complete elimination of Austrian Nazism. (2) Withdraw a large number of homeless refugees from the border, who are said to be very unfriendly to the Soviet Union. The UK and France were willing to take consistent action with us to submit the treaty to the representatives of the foreign ministers for consideration, and requested the Management Committee to conduct an investigation on the elimination of Nazism and the refugee issues and report on its progress; but the Soviet representative was unwilling to agree to the representatives drafting the Austrian peace treaty before there was any practical action on these two issues.

Austrian Refugees: We recognize the seriousness of this issue and are trying our best to solve it, especially the refugee issue. With the consent of the refugees, we help them return to their home country; but many people refuse to return to their home country because they are deeply afraid that political differences will lead to their death or imprisonment.

Our tradition of protecting political prisoners is very valuable, and we cannot agree to collectively expel these Chinese people from our region. The United Nations has a special committee studying this issue, and we will continue to work hard to find a solution; but this solution should not be a cruel solution that causes the American people to no longer be trusted. Delaying the signing of a peace treaty with Austria will lead to tragic results, because Austria is a temporary residence for political exiles until they can find a place to settle in other countries. We should adhere to our position at the conference, so that the war-stricken world can return to peace, and let the soldiers overseas return to their homeland and families, and turn swords into plowshares. The war has left the world scarred, and we must heal these wounds. We do not trust peace based on revenge. We believe in justice, generosity, and compassion. If we treat others with generosity and compassion, our enemies will become our friends. We should follow the path of peace and implore the great God to have mercy and grant peace to the world.

### Eradicate Opium and Narcotics; Encourage Citizens to Report

[Report from This Newspaper] The city police department has always strictly enforced laws and regulations in investigating and prohibiting opium and narcotics. After the expiration of the self-renewal registration period for opium addicts in April, in addition to supervising the sub-bureaus to conduct strict investigations and seizures, it also encourages citizens to report in various ways in order to eradicate them as soon as possible. If the citizens of this city are sure of the places where opium and narcotics are sold, manufactured, or hidden, and those who smoke opium and narcotics, they can report them to the police department or sub-bureaus in writing. The informant only needs to write down their address and name, and does not need to provide a guarantee, but must not make false accusations out of malice.
