### Fierce Battles for Two Days on the Outskirts of Changchun; Some Communist Troops Invade the City; Nationalist Troops in Sipingjie Continue Northward Advance

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] According to a telegram from Chen Jiazhen, Commander of the Changchun Security Regiment: Soviet troops completely withdrew from Changchun at 11:30 AM on the 14th. From 12:00 PM, Communist troops began attacking the outskirts. At 1:00 AM on the 15th, the airport was occupied by Communist troops. The siege of the city became extremely fierce. At 6:00 AM on the 16th, some Communist troops had already invaded the city. Furthermore, the telegram bureau here heard communications from the Changchun telegram bureau to Jinzhou and Chongqing, reporting a critical situation. After 3:00 PM, no further signals were received from Changchun, suggesting that the city's power supply had been cut off and the situation was unclear. Also, telephone communication between Changchun and Harbin has been cut off.

[Another Telegram] According to information received by relevant parties here: Changchun city has been bombarded by Communist troops, resulting in numerous casualties. Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the Changchun city defense, is leading his troops in stubbornly defending the isolated city, fighting against overwhelming odds. The battle is extremely fierce.

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Reports from Beiping and Shenyang today indicate that Communist troops have occupied three airfields outside Changchun and are rushing into this key northeastern city from multiple directions, forcing 7,000 Nationalist troops to retreat towards the Manzhou Coal Mining Building area.

[Associated Press, Shenyang, 16th] The Northeast Security Headquarters announced that the main force of the New First Army, equipped with American weaponry, entered Sipingjie at 10:00 AM this morning and will continue to advance towards Changchun to rescue the Changchun garrison. A neutral aircraft is currently planned to be dispatched to Changchun to rescue five male and one female American journalists.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 16th] A military spokesman for the National Government stated that the Nationalist troops in Changchun are greatly outnumbered and are still resisting the Communist siege. The Nationalist force consists of only a few thousand men, mostly from the New Sixth Army, with a small number of security forces. Tonight, news circulated here that the aircraft originally allocated for transporting officials back to the capital may be reassigned to transport special troops to Changchun, but this has not been confirmed.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] The Communist troops at the three stations on the Linyu-Jinzhou railway line - Qian Suo, Wanjia Tun, and Gao Ling - have been driven back on the 15th. Track repair is currently underway, and traffic is expected to resume on the 32nd.

[Reuters, New York, 16th] Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative to the United Nations, stated yesterday that the Chinese government has no intention of submitting the Northeast conflict to the Security Council for discussion, but hopes that the fighting will cease immediately after the arrival of mediation representatives in the Northeast and the return of Special Envoy Marshall to China.

### The Jiangsu High Court Is Packed; People Vie to See the Number One Female Traitor; Chen Bijun Proclaims in Court Her Willingness to Die

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Suzhou, 16th] The Jiangsu High Court tried Chen Bijun yesterday at 2:25 PM. The audience was so large that even the defendant's seat was occupied. When Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, Judge Lu Jiarui, Prosecutor Wei Weiqing, and Clerk Qin Daoli took their seats, the entire courtroom was packed. Even the bailiffs had barely any room to stand. After the court opened, Chen Bijun, escorted by bailiffs and military police, squeezed through the crowd. She was wearing a blue cloth cheongsam and appeared quite excited, with a rosy complexion and a loud voice, not at all like someone who had been ill for a long time. After the presiding judge asked about her age and place of origin, the prosecutor stood up and announced the prosecution's charges. Chen Bijun responded in court, holding a prepared defense statement, speaking at length, seemingly wanting to exploit the audience's sympathy and use her eloquent tongue to achieve her cunning goal. At one point, some ignorant members of the audience even applauded, which was stopped by the court. The presiding judge then asked a series of questions, showed her the evidence, and allowed Chen Bijun to read it freely. At 3:50 PM, he announced that the investigation of evidence was complete. The prosecutor rose to make his argument, and Chen Bijun added her own defense, appearing even more eloquent. The atmosphere became extremely tense, and order in the court became increasingly chaotic. Then, the public defender, Gao Rong, gave a customary defense. At 4:35 PM, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 3:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, the same time as Chu Minyi's sentencing. He then adjourned the court. As the audience rushed out of the court, a senior official of the High Court told reporters: "Today's disorder has set a new record since the establishment of the High Court."

### Disorder in the High Court; Chen Bijun Acts Like an Orator; Prosecutor Wei Lists Four Major Crimes

Chen Bijun was escorted to the court from the detention center in a horse-drawn carriage at 2:20 PM under heavy guard by military police. Her daughter and daughter-in-law arrived in the audience around 1:00 PM but quickly left because they were surrounded by reporters, only to return after the trial began. After the court opened, President Sun instructed the military police assisting in maintaining order to withdraw, as weapons were not allowed in the court. However, this made the order even more chaotic. Chen Bijun arrived in court with a slight smile, appearing very happy, like an orator. When the court asked about her age and place of origin, she stated: 56 years old, from Xinhui, Guangdong, residing at 30 Fazheng Road, Guangzhou. She had been a supervisory committee member of the Central Party Headquarters since 1924, "until now." She has two sons, three daughters, and three grandchildren. When the court asked about her assets, she replied in a rather disrespectful tone: "They have all been confiscated by the government. They should know better than I do." She then stated that she has a house at 30 Fazheng Road in Guangzhou, a house at 570 Fuli Road in Shanghai, and farmland in Guangdong, but she could not remember the acreage. The house at 18 Xikang Road in Nanjing "was a gift from comrades, but I never lived in it." She also has stocks, but she could not remember the exact amount.

At this time, Prosecutor Wei stood up and stated that the defendant is the wife of the traitor Wang Zhaoming, and had served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee. During the Sino-Japanese War, she colluded with the Japanese chieftain Konoe to secretly negotiate peace and then secretly left Chongqing, betraying the Central Government. She used secret telegrams with the code names "Ming" (referring to Wang Zhaoming) and "Cliff" (referring to the defendant) to co-govern with Wang, wielding great power. After Wang's death, she continued to travel around for the puppet organization and secretly established intelligence agencies to harm Central Government personnel. He then cited four specific events: (A) The puppet Guangdong provincial military and political affairs were all decided by the defendant, with the intention of cutting off the government's supply of materials and weakening the strength of the resistance. (B) She recruited bandits and reorganized Li Qun's former Fourth Route Army, appointing many puppet officials, showing her desire to help those with the same evil intentions. This occurred after the puppet Guangdong Governor Chen Chunpu left office, four months before Chu Minyi took office in Guangdong. (C) The intelligence from the puppet Central Executive Committee's intelligence leaders Liao Gongshao, Chen Gengting, and Jian Shu was all reported to the defendant for review, showing her control of the intelligence work in South China. (D) In personnel administration and administration, she only followed the orders of the enemy, requiring the consent of the "liaison officer Yazaki and the military commander Sakai," showing her collusion with the enemy and resistance to our country. The defendant has committed the crime stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, and should be tried according to law.

Chen Bijun Speaks Wildly in Her Defense

After the prosecutor returned to his seat, the court ordered Chen Bijun to defend herself. Chen Bijun knew that this was her last chance to gain public sympathy in her life, so she held a pencil, pointed in all directions, and spoke wildly, stating: (A) Her return to Guangdong was to carry out a mission, and going to Nanjing was to visit her elderly mother and grandchildren. Traveling between Nanjing and Guangdong cannot be arbitrarily concluded as intentional: two months in Nanjing, two months in Guangdong, with ulterior motives. (B) After Chen Chunpu left office, she independently managed Guangdong's affairs and invited Chu Minyi to Guangdong, which was not inappropriate. She was in Guangdong after Wang Zhaoming's death. At that time, there were widespread rumors that the American army was about to land, the security situation was volatile, and the Communist army took the opportunity to make trouble. After the governor resigned, many department heads also resigned. She believed that if she did not resolutely take office, the spread of the Communist army and the suffering of the people would be unimaginable. The 30 million people of Guangdong could not be abandoned, so she risked returning to Guangdong, arriving on March 12th. She presided over affairs until Chu Minyi took office in April. At this time, there was a shortage of food, and the price of rice in Guangdong reached a peak of 122,000 yuan per dan in legal tender. She negotiated with the Japanese after discussing with the heads of the civil and financial departments, and after great hardship, the Japanese agreed to open waterways and stop collecting military rice and stop collecting rice from the people. The price of rice plummeted to 52,000-53,000 yuan per dan. "This is the achievement of the civil and military comrades in Guangdong, which can be reported to the Premier above and to Mr. Wang below." As for the claim that Chen Yaozu reported everything to her when he was governor, it was because they lived in the same house, so what if they helped each other? (C) Regarding intelligence: (1) Who was the intelligence sent to? She was a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, and Chen Yaozu was a member of the Central Executive Committee. She cannot be responsible for telegrams addressed to the Central Executive Committee. (2) "If people send me things to read, am I responsible for the content? Whether I am related to the intelligence is one thing, and being in charge of the intelligence agency is another. If I am indeed responsible, I am willing to die, why would I deny it?" (D) They have at least achieved rationing by headcount, so that the people have food to eat. The hardship of negotiating with the Japanese for these matters, some of their affairs did require the consent of the Japanese side because Guangdong was a place occupied by Japanese military force. They are working hard to seek welfare for the people and cannot be called resistance to our country. If the government considers such achievements of rescuing the people as resistance to our country, she is willing to be sentenced to death (at this point, someone applauded, but was stopped by the court).

She even defended Wang, praising him highly, and said that she was still "working hard" after Wang's death because the "Sixth Plenary Session" declaration stated "worthy of the martyrs, worthy of the descendants, sharing life and death... to violate the purpose of jointly building the country," so she dared not stay at home in peace. She is unwilling to appeal, unwilling to defend herself, and willing to die calmly, but she also asks the court to leniently punish other collaborators.

The Court Announces the Investigation Is Completed

The court then began to question: The most important point of your defense is that the intelligence reports found were addressed to Chen Yaozu, not you? (Answer) I dare not say none of them. If it is addressed to Chen of the Central Supervisory Committee, then it is mine. (Question) Have you seen these intelligence reports? (Answer) Not now, I need to see them. (Question) Were you involved in the recruitment of the puppet army Zhang Yizhou and the former Fourth Army Li Qun? (Answer) I was not involved, but I did see Chen Yaozu's report. (Question) The secret telegram code names "Ming," "Cliff," and "Hua," "Ming" is Wang, "Cliff" is you? (Answer) According to the tone of the telegram, Wang is "Ming," and "Cliff," apart from me, there is no one. "Hua" can only be Chen Yaozu. (Question) Did all matters, large and small, in Guangdong province have to be discussed with the Japanese at that time? (Answer) Major matters yes, minor matters no. Major matters such as troop movements, passing through Japanese military zones, etc. (Question) Did the appointment of civil and military officials require the consent of Shizaki and Sakai? (Answer) Not consent, but notification. Do not forget that this is a Japanese-occupied area with 300,000 to 400,000 Japanese soldiers. (Question) Wang went from Chongqing to Vietnam, then to Shanghai, then to Japan, to contact the Japanese and sign the agreement. Were you always involved? (Answer) I knew about it, but it involved diplomacy and I did not participate. My task was to do things for the people. (Question) Did you agree with Wang's proposal? (Answer) Absolutely agreed. When making this answer, her tone was firm and powerful. (Question) Wang agreed when the decision was made in Nanjing to resist Japan? (Answer) Yes, because at that time it was believed that war was inevitable. (Question) When did you change your mind? (Answer) At the end of 1937, when the German ambassador Trautmann mediated the Sino-Japanese War. (Question) Why did you go to Chongqing later? (Answer) Wang advocated that the entire government become one. (Question) Since you agreed with peace, why not make suggestions to the central government and go to Hanoi first? (Answer) We made suggestions countless times, and we wanted to leave six times, but we always couldn't bear to leave. We only managed to leave on the sixth attempt. (Question) Since the majority of the central government officials advocated war, how could one or two people make a peace movement? (Answer) Normal legal procedures can be used when the country is normal, but not when it is in crisis. Moreover, one person's opinion is not the opinion of the whole country. After Wang left, he kept in contact with Chongqing by telegram until Zeng Zhongming was killed, and then the telegram contact was cut off. (Question) Did you have correspondence with Xu Chongzhi? (Answer) I once advised him to go to Nanjing or Shanghai to live, not to live in Hong Kong. (Question) On February 8, 1942, did you give a speech at the Greater Asia Conference in Guangdong? (Answer) Yes, the court then read out the original text, which included "National affairs have been misled by Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on Britain and the United States, leading to this point," (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did you advocate that we should not contact Britain and the United States, but should contact Japan? (Answer) This is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. If Japan had not attacked Pearl Harbor that year and had advanced north, would Britain and the United States have helped us as they do today? At this time, the court presented many pieces of evidence for review. (Question) Have you been to Japan? (Answer) I went there when I was seventeen. After that, I only went to see him when Wang was ill on March 3, 1944. Thereupon the court announced the investigation of evidence was completed, at 3:50 PM.

A Fierce Debate with the Prosecutor

Prosecutor Wei then stood up and argued that Wang was admired by the defendant, but Wang's basic ideas were wrong and his knowledge was useless. Yang Xiong and Qin Hui were both knowledgeable, but their character was extremely low. Her words and deeds all violated the central government and were ignorant of the world situation. The defendant did serve as a member of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Political Committee after the fall of the government, and there is party card evidence to check. Moreover, why shouldn't intelligence agents kill people? Saying that she didn't read the intelligence is just an excuse. As for the high prices in Guangdong province, the defendant and others maintained the ground, which was not wrong, but the merit cannot offset the demerit.

When Chen Bijun responded, her expression was extremely excited. She claimed: "I only understood two out of ten sentences of the prosecutor's words." She said: "Everyone knows whether Wang's words and deeds are good or bad. Saying 'the words are good but the deeds are not good,' 'there is no follow-up to saying this'." Heroes cannot be judged by success or failure, and they cannot be falsely accused just because they are dead. Whether her actions were beneficial to the country can be publicly asked of the people. She also said: "I have never been a member of the Central Executive Committee. The prosecutor insists that I admit it. I can only ask to go to the party headquarters to check. Documents can be moved. Provincial officials can certainly take them home to read, so why do you insist that it was given to me just because it was found in my house? In terms of administration, Japanese approval and consent are two different things. We cannot do things that the Japanese do not agree to, there is nothing to lose face. The area was not lost by us! As for the intelligence, first of all, it was not given to me at all, and even if it was given to me, it cannot be said that the intelligence was organized by me." The prosecutor was often very angry and stood up to question: "You say you don't understand, but you do! Do you understand Yang Xiong and Qin Hui? They were both knowledgeable, Qin Hui was the top scholar!" Chen also said angrily: "This is a court, so I won't say impolite words. A top scholar can only write essays and make articles, is that considered knowledgeable?" The prosecutor said: "He was very knowledgeable." Chen said: "You have to look at a person's views, because someone lost the battle, and we went to rescue the orphaned and helpless people." The atmosphere was extremely tense. The court then asked: "When the decision to resist Japan was made, you said Wang agreed. Resistance requires sacrifice, it requires a price." Chen replied: "We only fight when we have to fight, and we only sacrifice when we have to sacrifice." Asked: "The basic treaty stipulates the stationing of troops in Mongolia and North China, and the Sino-Japanese-Manchu declaration was issued. Is the Northeast not wanted?" Answer; "Of course not, the 'words' on the treaty can be eliminated, as long as everyone works hard. In fact, we wanted to make Manchukuo surrender, but we didn't succeed."

### One Court Debate, Sentencing on the 22nd

Then, the public defender Gao Rong stood up to make a defense, saying: The Japanese were so tyrannical, it is excusable that the defendants could barely maintain security, etc. The court then announced the end of the debate, scheduled sentencing for 3:00 PM on the 22nd, and adjourned. Chen Bijun was still taken back by horse-drawn carriage. (Please refer to the second page for more news about the trial of Chen and Chu).

### Awaiting Report from Special Committee, Security Council Decides to Postpone Discussion on Iranian Issue, U.S. Representative Firmly Requests Keeping It on the Agenda

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco, 16th Broadcast: The Security Council has decided to postpone discussions on the Iranian issue, pending receipt of a report from the committee of experts, after which discussions will resume. The experts committee's report is expected to be submitted within two days.

Following today's Security Council meeting, French representative Bonneau suggested requesting the United Nations Acting Secretary-General Lie to collect various intelligence reports on the Iranian issue to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. Lie immediately presented a lengthy report discussing the legal points regarding whether the Security Council could keep the Iranian issue on the agenda. As a result, the matter was submitted to a committee of experts for review, with a deadline of two days to return it to the Security Council along with their comments. U.S. Representative Stettinius requested that the Iranian issue remain on the agenda, stating that this approach would neither infringe upon Iranian sovereignty nor interfere with the content of the Soviet-Iranian agreement.

According to well-informed sources, Iran's announcement of the withdrawal of its complaint was, in reality, a last resort. Last weekend, the Soviet ambassador visited the Iranian prime minister three times, unequivocally stating that Soviet troops would certainly withdraw from Iran by May 6th. The Iranian prime minister, believing that the Soviet side had provided a firm guarantee, felt that continuing to lodge a complaint with the Security Council would be close to insulting the Soviet Union. The Iranian prime minister was in a difficult position and consulted with the Soviet ambassador several times, resulting in the cancellation of the complaint.

According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 16th, Soviet Representative Gromyko might withdraw from the meeting again if the Security Council keeps the Iranian issue on the agenda.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 15th] The Security Council met this evening to discuss whether to keep the Iranian issue on the agenda. Representatives from Iran and the Soviet Union requested the removal of the Iranian issue from the agenda, while representatives from Britain and the United States firmly opposed this, leading to heated debate. Soviet Representative Gromyko even accused the British and American representatives of "meddling" in the Iranian issue.

During today's Security Council meeting, it was first decided to add to the agenda the letters from the Soviet and Iranian representatives, as well as a letter from the Polish representative regarding the Spanish issue. Subsequently, Chairman Guo Taiqi read aloud a letter from Iranian representative Ardelan, informing the Council that Iran intended to withdraw its complaint against the Soviet Union. Soviet Representative Gromyko immediately rose to explain that the Iranian issue had been directly negotiated between Iran and the Soviet Union in Moscow, and the Security Council need not discuss it further. U.S. Representative Stettinius insisted that it was necessary to keep the issue on the agenda. Norwegian Representative Lieffer agreed with Stettinius's proposal, stating that removing this issue from the agenda would greatly affect the credibility of the Security Council. British Representative Cadogan expressed the same view. Representatives from Australia and Brazil echoed the British view. French Representative Parreau supported the view of the Norwegian representative, saying that he did not know why the Iranian issue could not be removed from the agenda. The Soviet representative then stated again, "Since the Iranian government has voluntarily requested the withdrawal of its complaint, there is no point in the Security Council continuing to discuss this matter."

### French Troops Reinforce Western Border; Spain Accuses France and the Soviet Union of Having a Secret Agreement, Invites Countries to Investigate the Truth in Spain

[United Press, Franco-Spanish Border, 15th] The Franco-Spanish border now has two lines of defense with French border guards and several security teams reinforced, making it difficult for Spaniards who illegally cross the border to sneak into France. The area along the eastern Pyrenees province, which stretches for 200 miles under the snow-covered Pyrenees Mountains, is under especially strict surveillance. [United Press, Tokyo, 16th] The Spanish government today issued formal invitations to countries that maintain "friendly relations" with Spain, inviting them to send a committee of experts to investigate whether German scientists are researching atomic bombs in Spain, as claimed by Poland. The invitation was issued through the British ambassador. The Soviet Union may not be on the list of invitees, as it does not maintain diplomatic relations with Spain. [United Press, London, 15th] Madrid Radio broadcast tonight, stating, "There is a secret anti-Franco agreement between France and the Soviet Union, stipulating that Soviet troops may enter Spain via France through the German and Austrian occupied zones."

[United Press, Paris, 16th] Sources in the French Foreign Ministry today refuted the Madrid Radio broadcast regarding a secret agreement between the Soviet Union and France.

### President Truman Said to Be Planning Visit to Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] According to reliable sources today, President Truman plans to visit the Philippines in July and then travel to Japan. MacArthur's headquarters has not commented on this.

### Indian Congress Party Accepts Muslim League Demands

### Chen Bijun on Trial, Actually Argues Back with the Prosecutor

— Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Suzhou, 16th

Today, during the High Court's trial of traitor Chen Bijun, courtroom order was as the presiding judge stated, "Completely unacceptable!" Repeatedly shouting, "Intolerable!" According to court officials, the scene was unprecedented in its spectacle, and the disorder was also unparalleled.

Because Chen Bijun is a woman, the number of female spectators attending the court today was higher than at previous trials of other traitors, accounting for about three or four tenths of the audience.

Wang Wenxuan, the daughter of traitor Wang Jingwei, wearing a plain-colored cheongsam, arrived at the court at 12:50 PM with two female friends wearing indigo-dyed cloth cheongsams. As they entered the court, the press corps rushed forward to ask for her impressions. Wang's attitude was natural. According to reports, she stated that she had come to listen and prepare for reporters' questions and that she would only speak after the trial was over. They quietly stood aside until the trial was over, then hired a car and left. Wang's daughter indicated that tomorrow, the newspaper would report, "Wang Jingwei's daughter attended the court."

Chen Bijun was escorted to the courthouse by half-carriage from the detention center at about 2:00 PM. Chen Bijun usually dislikes photography reporters taking pictures, but today, although she wanted to refuse, it was not possible!

Chen Bijun was wearing a blue silk cheongsam, with some gray hair, a fountain pen in her collar, a jade bracelet on her left hand, and a watch on her right hand. She was obese, had a rosy complexion, a calm demeanor, and spoke Cantonese-accented Mandarin, sharply and clearly. She often performed with an oratorical posture, hoping to gain sympathy. She was truly a "treasure" (Puppet) of the female world!

In reading her defense, Chen Bijun first declared that she was not hoping to be exempted from punishment, but only to confess. As to how the audience listened to it, she did not care. In her defense, she criticized many points in the prosecutor's indictment, as well as the inappropriate and erroneous use of words, and asked the prosecutor to provide concrete proof, causing the presiding judge to hurriedly flip through the evidence while Chen Bijun continued her defense.

When Chen Bijun's defense came to an end, applause actually rose from the audience, which was immediately stopped by the presiding judge, who said, "This is a court, not a speech. Spectators should have common sense!"

Chen Bijun claimed, "I am a 56-year-old woman, with a 77-year-old mother, two sons, three daughters, and two grandchildren. I could have been at home holding my grandchildren, but I could not abandon the tens of millions of people in the occupied areas. Hoping to alleviate the suffering of the people, I endured humiliation and hardship, so that I could comfort the spirits of the late Premier and Wang Jingwei in heaven," and her voice was mixed with sobs at the end.

The court asked Chen Bijun: Did you approve of Wang Jingwei's peace proposition? She answered: "Absolutely approve!" Her tone was heavy and forceful.

Subsequently, the prosecutor refuted Chen Bijun's defense, believing that Chen Bijun was influenced by Wang Jingwei's fundamentally flawed ideas, which led to a lack of clarity in her thinking. Chen Bijun retorted: "One cannot judge heroes by success or failure. If the Japanese had not advanced south, what situation would China be in now?" She seemed to extremely regret Japan's policy errors, which led to the failure of the peace movement! When Chen Bijun argued back, the prosecutor became stern and greatly angered. Chen Bijun was also sharp and mean, pressing her point aggressively, creating a tense situation. The presiding judge intervened in time to inquire about other issues, and the atmosphere began to ease.

### Chu Minyi's Nagging

— Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Suzhou, 15th

Escorted by Carriage

Crowds Gather to See the Arch-Traitor

Chu Minyi, who is over sixty years old, was escorted by carriage, his favorite mode of transportation in the past, from the detention center to the courthouse at 2:00 PM on the 15th. The only difference was that in the past, he was usually accompanied by a female athlete who drove the carriage and paraded it through the streets for people to admire. Today, he sat quietly in a corner of the carriage under the supervision of bailiffs, only to be "admired" by ten thousand people as a prisoner.

Long Gown and Trousers

Yu Si's Face Reveals Old Age

Chu Minyi's defense lasted for two hours, with many repetitions and digressions, unable to avoid the typical ailments of an elderly person. Waving his hands and talking eloquently, he behaved as if he was delivering a speech, trying to appear calm. Today, he wore a fine woolen gown, a small French-style hat, and had trousers tied at the ankles. His beard was full.

Nagging and Tedious

High-Pitched Voice, Slow Tune

Chu Minyi interspersed his defense with story-like narrations, nagging and tediously, making listeners feel confused. Because Chu Minyi's voice was quite high and his tone was slow, it was quite convenient for reporters to hear, but there were many digressions, nagging and tediously, making it difficult for reporters to grasp the central point, making it difficult to write, and thus giving reporters a lot of trouble.

Does Not Admit to Being the Main Culprit

Claims to be No. 12 on the List of Traitors

Chu Minyi said that he was not worthy of the prosecutor's accusation that he was the main culprit of treason. According to his own ranking, the pseudo-foreign minister should be ranked as the 12th traitor, because above him were the five presidents of the five Yuan, the five vice-presidents of the five Yuan, and a minister of internal affairs.

In the Puppet Government

Chu Minyi Served as Puppet Foreign Minister

Chu Minyi claimed that when he was the pseudo-foreign minister, he did not sign the basic treaty with Japan or the declaration of war against Britain and the United States. The prosecutor retorted, "In that case, you were the puppet foreign minister in the puppet government!"

"Golden Signboard"

"Smashed by the Corrupt?"

Chu Minyi deeply hated the corrupt officials and those who used their power to extort money in the pseudo-organization, because they had smashed the so-called "peaceful resistance against Japan" golden signboard!

Gambling with Japan

"After Eating the White Tiger, There is a Green Dragon"

According to his confession, the Japanese believed that China was the most difficult to deal with. China had two governments, Chongqing and Nanjing, just like having two doors to bet on, with one you gamble on, after eating the White Tiger, there is still the Green Dragon. Therefore, they had no good feelings towards the pseudo-government. Unexpectedly, Japan surrendered too quickly, and the pseudo-government lost the chance to act as an internal response to the central government, which seemed to be Chu Minyi's only regret.

Feigning Mercy at the End

Pleading for Small Traitors

When Chu Minyi was defending himself, he pleaded for the small traitors in his status as a prisoner awaiting death, saying: "Except for those who are corrupt and extort money, the rest are forced by life circumstances." He requested that those who have been sentenced have their sentences reduced, and those who have not been arrested be exempted from prosecution, in order to "reserve talents for the country." Therefore, he believed that the central government's conditions for punishing traitors were not applicable at this time.

Chu Minyi Prays for Early Death

Admits that He is Old and Useless

After learning that traitors Miao Bin and Chen Gongbo had been sentenced to death, Chu Minyi knew that he would surely die and asked the presiding judge to sentence him to death three times, because he felt that although he was 64 years old, he was still strong and might still live for more than a decade. If he was sentenced to life imprisonment, it would waste prison food and damage the national treasury. Given that many people had nothing to eat, he really did not want the country to support such a useless old man. At the same time, he said that he liked to be active and would be unbearable to be confined in prison.

Defending Eloquently

Eyes Cast Towards the Press Corps

When Chu Minyi was defending or answering questions eloquently, he would often cast his eyes towards the press corps, as if he was afraid of misremembering something. He not only elaborated on everything but also said that there were many listeners (referring to the spectators) and that it would be okay to talk about it. According to reports, after Nanjing fell, Chu Minyi was the first to "return to the capital" and visit the mausoleum.

Chu Minyi Leaves the Court

The Sound of Crows and Magpies at Dusk

It was dusk. During the trial, the courtroom was silent, while outside, the crows and magpies were chirping, seeking a place to roost urgently, as if they were mourning for Chu Minyi.

The trial ended at 7:15 PM. When Chu Minyi was escorted back to the detention center, the crowd outside the courtroom was no less numerous than during Chen Bijun's trial.

Editorial

### Japan's General Election: First the Result, Then the Analysis

The Japanese general election, which has been the focus of global attention, has now been announced. The reason why this general election has attracted worldwide attention is because everyone wants to see what kind of trends in Japan are reflected by this election. Supporting a democratic Japan is the general intention of the United Nations, and it is not difficult to discern whether Japan is moving towards the path of democracy from this general election. The results of this general election are as follows: the Liberal Party won 139 seats, the Social Democratic Party won 93 seats, the Progressive Party won 91 seats, the Cooperative Party won 16 seats, the Communist Party won 5 seats, and independents won 84 seats. The predecessor of the Liberal Party was the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government party), and the predecessor of the Progressive Party was the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party). Speaking of the Seiyūkai, the impression of this party on the Chinese people is naturally the most profound. The author of the Tanaka Memorial was the president of the Seiyūkai when he formed the Tanaka Cabinet; Inukai Tsuyoshi also formed his cabinet as the president of the Seiyūkai. In the minds of the Chinese people, this is deeply and inextricably linked to Japanese militarists and aggression. The result of this general election is that the Liberal Party, the incarnation of the Seiyūkai, won the most seats. Therefore, it is worth noting how Japanese politics will evolve in the future. Regardless of whether the Shidehara Cabinet continues to exist, or whether the leader of the Liberal Party, Hatoyama Ichirō, comes out to form a coalition cabinet with various parties, the result of this general election has pointed out a trend, that is, Japan's conservatism is still very strong, and efforts to promote democratization still need support.

Originally, the Chinese people did not place much importance or expectation on this Japanese general election. The Japanese people have been ruled by militarists for a long time, and the road to democracy will definitely not be achieved overnight. It was expected that the Liberal Party, as the incarnation of the Seiyūkai, would obtain the most votes in this election by utilizing the original organization and momentum of the Seiyūkai. However, it is worth exploring how much potential there is for Japan's democratization as a result of this general election. According to recent news reports, two recent events in Japan are worth noting. (1) According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 1st: Sakurajima volcano in southern Japan has been spewing ash and rocks for 22 days. The molten lava is boiling and flows at half a mile wide and two miles long, continuing to flow down the slope towards the small village of Kurokami at a rate of three to four feet per hour. It will soon flow into Kagoshima Bay and may solidify into a narrow path connecting Sakurajima with the main island of Kyushu. Some elderly villagers believe that Japan's defeat in the war has angered the gods, hence the volcanic eruption. It is said that the Emperor's younger brother recently went to a shrine in the mountains behind Kagoshima to inform the gods that Japan had been defeated. Not long after, the volcano erupted. (2) According to a Reuters report from Tokyo on the 6th: At Chofu airfield, fifteen miles west of Tokyo, the first organized act of sabotage by Japanese against the Allied forces occurred. All personnel of the U.S. Fifth Air Force stationed there have been ordered to be armed and on alert for 24 hours. Japanese rioters sneaked into the airfield in the dark, damaging transportation and aircraft equipment of great value, cutting telephone and telegraph lines, and destroying telegraph machines. Judging from the nature of the sabotage, it seems to have been carried out by people with specialized skills, so it is speculated that the saboteurs may be Japanese soldiers.

The above two facts tell us that the stubborn thinking of the Japanese people has not changed due to this defeat in the war. Japan was defeated in the war, but the Japanese believe that they have angered the gods. Judging from their words, it is as if Japan should not have been defeated, so the gods are angry and spewing fire; if Japan had won, the gods would not be angry and would not spew fire! If this kind of thinking still exists in the hearts of the Japanese people, then the Japanese will definitely continue to dream the delusion of "Hakkō ichiu" (all the world under one roof)! In their dreams, they may still believe that this defeat is only temporary, and that the gods will protect the Japanese people and not only restore their inherent glory but also rule "all the world." From this small matter, it can be seen how deeply rooted Japan's aggressive thinking is, and how urgent the need for Japanese re-education is. As for the sabotage of the Allied airfield, since it was an organized action and carried out by Japanese with specialized skills, it can be seen that the Japanese people, even under the Allied occupation of Japan, are still not aware of the cause and effect of the defeat and are still secretly plotting. From the former fact, we can see how widespread and deeply ingrained aggressive thinking is among the Japanese people and needs to be clarified. From the latter fact, we can see that the Japanese people are ready to take retaliatory action at any time. All of this should prompt the Allied nations participating in the control of Japan to consider carefully when deciding on policies to control Japan.

Observing the results of this Japanese general election in conjunction with the previous two facts, it can be seen that it is still too early for the Japanese people to thoroughly realize their defeat. A democratic Japan still has to go through a long road. Therefore, the joint Allied occupation of Japan should last for a longer period; moreover, the methods and means of controlling Japan seem to require adjustment and strengthening. In Potsdam, the Allied powers decided to use Japan's existing institutions to govern Japan. Japan requested to retain the emperor system, but the Allied response was that the emperor must be subject to the control of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. This shows that Japan surrendered unconditionally, and the power to abolish or retain the entire system and institutions is in the hands of the Allied commander. Due to recent events in Japan, especially the victory of the Liberal Party, the incarnation of the Seiyūkai, in the general election, the latent nature of Japanese aggressive thinking is very strong. It is worth considering whether the decision to use Japan's existing institutions to govern Japan can be called wise.

Japan after the general election is still the same Japan with a new name; however, from the Japan of the Seiyūkai, it has become the Japan of the Liberal Party. The eradication of aggressive militarism and theocratic thinking still requires a very long period. It seems that the time has not yet come to rely on the Japanese people's own initiative to achieve democracy in Japan. The Allied occupation of Japan and the re-education of Japan must be intensified from now on, until the remaining Japanese traditional thinking, that is, Japanese aggressive thinking, is completely eradicated, and only then can Japan truly embark on the path of democratization.

### Military and Civilians Who Do Not Maintain Order When Boarding Vehicles Will Be Detained

The order at tram and bus stations in this city has been quite chaotic recently. In view of this, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has dispatched an officer from the Transportation Department from today, leading a patrol team (a team leader, two military police, and two police officers) to patrol the routes in a patrol car. Regardless of military personnel or civilians, anyone who does not obey the order, tries to force their way onto the vehicle, enters or exits through the exit, or climbs on the outside of the vehicle will be arrested.

### Long-Term Residents of Mingyuanfang Petitioned the City Government Yesterday

[Our Reporter] More than 300 long-term residents of Mingyuanfang, located at the intersection of Huade Road and Taowu Road, petitioned the city government in a group at about 11 o'clock yesterday morning, demanding that all the houses in the Fang currently occupied by Jews who colluded with the enemy be vacated and returned to the original tenants. According to the petitioners, they lived in the Fang before April 1943, and legally leased houses. On April 21 of that year, a large group of Jewish refugees colluded with the enemy, brutally beat the residents of the Fang, and forcibly occupied the houses by force, and have lived there until now. The city government immediately sent Wang Zhaoquan of the Secretariat to receive them, and promised to give a reasonable solution in the near future, and will report all the requests to the mayor for instructions.

### Impersonating Others and Forging Documents; Blatantly Breaking Into the Military Law Office; Attempting to Deceive and Release Criminals; Chen Shiqing Was Audacious and Reckless

[Our Reporter] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has repeatedly seized lawless people impersonating soldiers and swindling under false pretenses recently. At the beginning of this month, a person named Tang Duanbao was arrested for wearing a military uniform and swaggering through the city. After interrogation, it was found that he did not have military status, and he was immediately taken to the court for investigation. Suddenly, a letter was received from Wang Tiehan, commander of the 49th Army, stating that Tang was a plainclothes member of the army and was dispatched to work in Shanghai and was mistakenly arrested, requesting his release. After receiving the letter, the Garrison Headquarters immediately informed the army that the criminal had been sent to the court. Several days later, another letter was received from the army, with a completely different tone from the previous one, denying that there was such a person as Tang Ruibao, and upon further identification, the official seal on the letter was completely different. Just as it was about to investigate, two young men dressed in American military uniforms suddenly came yesterday morning, one of whom was wearing a revolver. They claimed to be the major deputy battalion commander of the Special Service Battalion of the 49th Army, and came directly to the Military Law Office with the letter to question why the criminal Tang had not been released. They also claimed that they were dispatched to come and wanted to take Tang back to the military headquarters, etc. Upon inspecting the documents, it was known that they were the ones who forged the official documents of the 49th Army, and they were immediately detained for interrogation. According to the confession, the name is Chen Shiqing, from Hangzhou, 26 years old, living at No. 10 Xinkai Road, Hangzhou, and has been working as a porter. Recently, in order to facilitate travel, he and Tang Ruibao, who had been arrested, conspired to impersonate soldiers. In order to show off, he bought two pistols in Hangzhou. After Tang was arrested, he repeatedly sent letters urging him to find a way, and in desperation, he took this measure. The other person, Xu Shuren, is indeed a second lieutenant assistant at the Military Uniform Factory of the Ministry of Military Administration. He met Chen at a friend's house at No. 30 Wuchang Road yesterday morning, and Chen invited him to go to the Garrison Headquarters together, but he did not know about the forgery of documents. According to the confession, Chen committed the crime of daring to impersonate a soldier, forging documents, and blatantly breaking into the Military Law Office in an attempt to deceive and release criminals, which is illegal. He was immediately taken into custody for strict interrogation.

### Results of Miscellaneous Grain Bidding

Changjiang Lianxing and 9 Other Companies Win the Bids

As a result, the winning bidders were Changjiang, Lianxing, Xiaoyu, Hongkang, Songji, Shen Yuanlai, Hesheng, Hengtaifeng, Qu Wude, Sichang, and Guchang. It is stipulated that half of the bid amount will be paid first today, and the full amount will be paid on the 19th.

### Residents of the French Concession Petition; Authorities Conduct On-Site Investigation

Relocation subsidies will be decided in a few days. [Our Reporter] The residents of the French Concession in this city petitioned the city government the day before yesterday to exempt them from demolition. In order to clarify the actual situation, make a final plan, and minimize inconvenience to the residents as much as possible, the Engineering Bureau authorities sent Zheng Dekui, Director of the Third District Engineering Office, and several engineers from the Structural Office and the Ditch Engineering Office to inspect the area at 10 a.m. yesterday. The residents' representatives of the district were invited to investigate together, which took six hours. As a result, it was considered that the Concession was indeed extremely dirty, and at the same time, the ditches were blocked and the riverbed was high. The French Concession is an important drainage channel in western Shanghai, which has a great impact and must be thoroughly dredged. According to the person in charge, the width of the dredging of the riverbed of the Concession is 4 meters, and the depth of the dredging of the silt is 1 meter to 1.5 meters. The width of the riverbank must be determined according to the soil quality of the slope, otherwise it will still collapse. It has now been decided to exempt the houses outside the bridge abutment with the old bridgehead as the boundary from demolition. Each tile house will be given a relocation fee of 56,000 yuan, and each thatched house will be given 28,000 yuan. In order to enable people from all walks of life to understand the actual situation, the Bureau has specially scheduled to invite personnel from various agencies to visit at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

### Preliminary Election of City Councilors Representatives; Press Association Elected Yesterday

The Journalists' Association held the preliminary election of city councilors representatives at the Xianhan Society on Guizhou Road at 11 a.m. yesterday.

### Communicating with the Enemy and Sabotaging Transportation: Yang Chunting Sentenced to Six Years

Li Hu Given a Fixed-Term Military Sentence

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Chunting, who secretly reported to the enemy's constitution and sabotaged our secret radio station case, was sentenced yesterday by the High Court. The main text of the sentence: Conspiring with the enemy state, sabotaging communication, sentenced to six years of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for six years, and all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members. The High Court also heard two other cases on the same day. One was the case of Finnish national Hämäläinen, who served as a consul in Shanghai during the enemy-puppet occupation period. He was recently accused of smuggling military supplies, collecting intelligence, and supplying it to the enemy, and the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. During yesterday's trial, the defendant vehemently denied the charges. The court ordered further investigation, and the case was adjourned for another hearing. The defendant was still allowed to be released on the original bail. Another case involved Li Hu from Sichuan, who was accused of serving as a deputy officer and acting captain of the escort team of the enemy's Central China Fisheries Company. He was detained by the police and transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation, after which a public prosecution was filed. During yesterday's hearing by the collegiate panel, the defendant stated: He joined the military after the "January 28th" Incident and, after the "August 13th" Incident, Shanghai fell. He lost contact with his unit and stayed in Shanghai to make a living and never served in a puppet organization. He claimed that the current accusation was a false accusation due to personal grudges. The court announced the conclusion of the argument and scheduled the sentencing for 2:30 PM on the 23rd.

### Uncertain Foothold Leads to Continued Gold Price Decline; Fewer Settlements Cause US Dollar to Fall as Well

After the Bank of China's strike yesterday caused it to rise and then fall back, the market clearly showed more profit-taking. It once broke through the 1.5 million mark in the morning, and then stabilized slightly. Upon investigation, it opened flat, and the situation was stable after opening, struggling for a long time around 1.54 million. The Bank of China's allocation price remained the same, the market price was low, and no one wanted it, but after that, the bullish camp gradually weakened, and the goods purchased in the previous few days were gradually released, gradually decreasing. Some bulls panicked, breaking through the 1.5 million mark in the morning, retreating to 1.49 million, and then stabilizing slightly. The situation was more stable in the afternoon, hovering around 1.52 million. As a result, it continued to fall by 30,000 compared to the previous close. Gold jewelry was 166,000, silver was 1,500, and silver dollars were also flat. The unofficial discount rate was 1.2 to 1.5 cents due to loose money market conditions, while the outside market was about 1.6 to 3 cents.

The buying of US dollars temporarily stopped, and more were released. At first, it hovered around 2,050 yuan. As the price of gold fell back, the US dollar also slightly declined. With fewer settlements, the supply exceeded demand yesterday. It once broke the 2,000 yuan mark in the morning and recovered slightly at noon. It hovered around 2,020 yuan in the afternoon. As a result, it continued to fall by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. The gold arbitrage was about 750 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong banknotes were mediocre, with old banknotes slightly down and new banknotes flat. The US exchange rate, rupees, and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were all flat. Non-compliant imported goods were all converted to buy US dollars for compensation.

### Government Bonds Are Narrow, High Prices Appear Frequently

Government bonds continued to be manipulated by major players in the industry yesterday. With the return of Beibang speculators, the opening price immediately broke through the 5,000 yuan mark, gradually rising from around 5,050 yuan to a new high of 5,350 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. At noon, it hovered around 5,250 yuan. The police investigated the old nest of the Securities Exchange Building, and storms arose in the middle, but because the bond market became increasingly dark, the trend was not universal. The noon close was still stable, resulting in another 300 yuan increase compared to the previous close. In addition, A, B, and D bonds rose slightly, while E bonds fell slightly.

### Stocks Gradually Weaken

High prices of Chinese stocks are still difficult to sustain, and after being firm, they gradually weakened. Although the number of chips is low, the mentality of people in the industry is reversed. The bulls take profits when they are profitable, so good times do not last. Yong Yarn gradually fell from a high of 5,400 yuan in the middle of the session, Meiya from 4,500 yuan, and Jingfu from 450 yuan. Various unpopular stocks tended to stabilize uniformly. Xinguang and Qinxing, which were in the second hottest position, were bought up, and the market price gradually rose. Each veteran stock stopped investing and turned to buying, and the situation gradually stabilized. At noon, popular stocks closed at low prices, while unpopular stocks closed at high prices, going in opposite directions, and the price difference narrowed. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn and Jingfu rose slightly, Meiya rose by half, and Xinguang and Qinxing rose by about 10%. Unpopular stocks and veteran stocks were all stable. In the afternoon, the call prices for futures contracts for Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Liangfu were slightly higher, while Xinguang and Qinxing were slightly lower. Yesterday, a certain trust company in Guangdong made a profit and sold a lot of Yisha, so the upward trend was difficult to sustain. There was still activity with many short positions in the morning. Yisha saw a high price of 14,200 yuan, but after rising, it turned to consolidation. The bulls' mentality was that if they did not advance, they would retreat, and the camp was shaken, falling back sharply. Yisha once fell to the edge of the 13,000 mark and then stabilized. The noon close was down 10% for paper industry and Asia, and down about 5% for the rest.

### Yarn and Cotton Prices Rise Slightly

Yesterday, the yarn market started strong and then weakened. In the early morning, due to the very small allocation of 20-count yarn by the Textile Construction Corporation to the industry on the previous day, the supply was tighter, so it continued to rise by 30,000 to 40,000. Then, because buyers and traders had no profit, they all adopted a wait-and-see attitude and fell back by 20,000. Shuangma once rose to 1.12 million, but finally closed at 1.07 million, only rising by 10,000 compared to the previous day. The other miscellaneous brands rose by 20,000, and the 32-count Xiantao double-strand thread rose by 50,000 because the Textile Construction Corporation did not supply any of the companies that applied to purchase the thread on the 15th. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Corporation opened for sale 20 kinds of cotton cloth and 16 kinds of Mexican cloth. Today, it opened for sale cotton yarn, wool, and silk products as usual.

Recently, American and Indian cotton from foreign countries has been arriving one after another. Because the selling price of local cotton is too high, it has fallen into difficulties. Most holders are unwilling to sell cheaply at reduced prices, so the market is cold. The American cotton ordered by the Textile Construction Corporation has been imported one after another, and tens of thousands of bales of Indian cotton have also arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, the spot price of raw cotton has not been opened for several days, and manufacturers in general can take this opportunity to obtain cheap raw materials. Currently, manufacturers can make a profit of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per bale of yarn, and it is expected that the price of yarn will gradually ease in the future.

### US Cotton Textile Export Volume for the Second Quarter Has Been Determined by the Administration

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The export volume of US cotton textiles for the second quarter has been stipulated by the Civilian Production Administration as 9.6% of the total cotton textile production. (Note: The export volume approved for the first quarter of this year was 11%.) According to this stipulated volume, 232,500,000 yards of cotton goods can be exported. (Note: 255,300,000 yards for the first quarter.) However, industry insiders believe that the actual change in cotton goods exports will not be as significant as announced, as the production volume in the second quarter will increase rather than decrease. According to the Civilian Production Administration, the decrease in cotton textile exports in the second quarter is due to the gradual recovery of cotton textile manufacturing in Europe. It also stated that the bureau will try to increase the export volume of raw cotton.

### Congestion in Local Warehouses Affects the Import of US Cotton

[China News Agency, Washington, 16th] Officials of the Export-Import Bank announced here yesterday that due to difficulties in US dollar exchange rates and other war-related problems, a large amount of American cotton shipped to China cannot be sold, and other cotton payments based on cash on delivery have not been cleared. As a result, Shanghai's limited port space and warehouses have become congested, resulting in delays in unloading ships and increased storage charges. Officials from the Chinese government and the Washington Export-Import Bank, in view of this, have consulted on possible solutions to alleviate the congestion. As a result of the consultation, they agreed that all American cotton consigned, cash on delivery, or still awaiting payment should be used as funds for the recent cotton loan from the Export-Import Bank to the Bank of China under the guarantee of the Chinese government. American cotton exporters, whether consignment or cash on delivery, can request payment from the above loan. This policy also applies to European countries.

### Oil and Grain Fall Slightly, Rice Price Rises Alone

Yesterday, the rice market responded to the frequent increases in the inland areas. Japonica and Indica rice continued to rise by 500 to 1,000 yuan, and hundred-yuan rice also increased by more than 1,000 yuan. Sales of flour to foreign ports were temporarily suspended, and the local market adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The price fell by 300 to 400 yuan, as did wheat bran, which fell slightly by 100 yuan. Soybean cake followed the decline of other goods and fell by 200 yuan. Soybean exports were stagnant, and domestic sales showed weakness. Medium and low prices fell by 300 to 500 yuan. The oil market's demand from the inland areas weakened, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. All grains, except for the price of rice, fell uniformly. It is also reported that, according to information from the rice market, a total of more than 5,000 stones of seven varieties of rice, including white japonica, arrived in the city yesterday, namely 2,829 stones of white japonica, 62 stones of white yuan, 339 stones of sheep indica, 624 stones of Du indica, 695 stones of early rice, 1,143 stones of thin rice, and 24 stones of Yin yuan.

(3) Imported goods that may hinder the development of domestic production should be taxed at a high rate.

(4) Luxury goods or non-essential goods should be taxed heavily.

(5) All high-quality domestic raw materials and export goods that should be retained domestically should be taxed separately, and other goods will be exempted from export tax.

(6) Expand the implementation of protective tariffs. Measures such as manufacturing plants and tax refunds for raw materials are still being drafted, with the principle of encouraging export industries.

The special commissioner for the Jinghu area received 26 units of enemy-puppet schools and cultural institutions, and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau received 19 units. However, many units' addresses are occupied by national troops and Japanese soldiers and civilians, making it impossible to repair and utilize them, which is very inconvenient.

### World-Renowned Players to Compete: Wimbledon Tennis Tournament to Resume This Summer, Starting June 24

[United Press, Wimbledon, England, 15th] The Wimbledon International Lawn Tennis Championships will be revived this summer. Although the court still bears the scars of German bombs, the grass is beautifully green. According to an official of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, the news of Wimbledon's resumption after a seven-year hiatus has generated immense interest. During the war, one bomb hit the grounds, destroying 1,200 of the 10,000 seats around the Centre Court. As Britain is currently busy repairing damaged houses, it has no time to attend to sports grounds, so the damaged portions of the court may not be repaired for this year's tournament. Due to transportation difficulties, the All England Lawn Tennis Club plans to cancel the qualifying rounds for this year's tournament, with only players selected by the tournament committee participating in the competition from June 24 to July 6. The events will include men's and women's singles and doubles, and mixed doubles. The list of players will be announced in late May. According to Tennis Club Secretary Macaulay, "Countries around the world have been inquiring about the tournament. Tennis competition has quickly returned to its former glory in European countries affected by the war, with almost everyone having the ambition to win the championship. China will also participate in the competition. South American countries have expressed keen interest, and the United States will send a strong team as usual. British players will be younger, lack practice, and have generally not encountered strong opponents."

### Chastity Arch

— Stee

Let the setting sun lament the loneliness of the ancient ferry,

Sixty years of inhuman existence cast a massive shadow;

Stone slabs sob with the ghosts' wails from solitary graves,

On rainy nights, the sparks of inextinguishable fire still burn.

It was a well-meaning magistrate who wanted to honor achievements,

Rushing out of the yamen to catch up with the dust to the capital,

Regardless of the curses of passersby thousands of years later.

Let the stone bridge that was to be built be replaced by a wooden bridge.

An imperial decree held up in mid-air,

Even if the last corner of silk is long rotten;

The tears of three thousand palace maids,

How brilliantly colorful they are!

The river water here cannot bear to flow straight.

The surface of the water uses ten thousand golden hands to crush the widow's heart,

Causing young girls to tremble while holding their chests,

Even their midnight dreams are soaked with cold sweat.

### Prodigal Son Returns

— Xuehua

Two years ago, I wrote a story that began with light and ended in darkness, so many friends said to me, "You've got it backwards! It should begin with darkness and end with light; that's the right way."

At a certain period, the story of the prodigal son's return indeed seemed to have become a set pattern. No matter what literary magazine you opened, whether it was a novel or short story, they were almost all the same: there was always a prodigal son wallowing in darkness, reckless, depraved, suffering greatly, and finally realizing his mistake, turning back, and embarking on a path of light.

Shouldn't a prodigal son wallowing in darkness turn back? Of course, absolutely yes! Since humans are born from desire, they are inevitably tempted by it, and they cannot avoid stumbling and falling. As long as they don't fall all the way down, as long as they are willing to turn back, "turning back is the shore," they may well regain the light. So the story of the prodigal son's return is meaningful; it curses darkness and praises light.

However, I often feel that people are curious creatures, especially young people. When they hold a story of the prodigal son's return and read it with relish, perhaps the final moment of light is in the minority, while longing for the moment of wild revelry and intoxication when the prodigal son wallows and falls is in the majority?

Young people are also the boldest. Although hell is terrible, if someone tells them that they can still come out after entering hell, they might say, "Then I might as well jump in and play!"

I don't oppose the story of the prodigal son's return, but sometimes I can't help but have some misgivings: because the prodigal son can return, will it create more prodigal sons?

### Dead Soul

— Huang Wenjin

He quietly lowered the tattered window curtains and lit the dim blue desk lamp. A faint ray of light shone on the picture frame. He smiled at the image of himself from a year ago. He remembered that she had accompanied him to have that smart evening suit made, and her lipstick stain still remained on the snow-white shirt.

The withered petals of the narcissus hung on the table, resting next to the train ticket. He sighed and picked up the withered petals and the ticket, putting them together in his bag.

He opened the closet, which was empty. Those luxurious clothes were probably on display in the windows of used clothing stores at this moment. Suddenly, he found something in the corner—that most cursed black hat! He unconsciously bowed his head in silence.

He felt some shame. It seemed that a sin tree that could not be destroyed had already been planted in his heart. How many base deeds were growing on those black branches.

Black hat, who could forget these traitors during the war.

He suddenly remembered himself. This was a dead soul that had been numb for many years, like a pair of poisoned and rotten shoes that could never step on the bright road again. Those days of drunken revelry.

He raised his head regretfully. Good times cannot be turned back. Many beautiful images appeared one after another, and the groans of those he had trampled on echoed in his ears. These were the charming laughter of subordinates, those dazzling eyes, diamonds, jewels, and money poured into his black hat like lake water.

"As long as you love me, I will always love you..."

But now no one paid attention to him anymore. The skyscrapers were still brightly lit, and his beautiful dreams were shattered by wind and rain, so easily, from stepping onto the jeep...

The sound of the whistle woke him from his daze. Nothing was his. Now was the time for him to leave this city, taking with him his only possession—a dead soul.

### A Little Talk About Music

— Zhongyuan

One evening, for various reasons, I was extremely annoyed and lay in bed worrying, unable to sleep. Just then, a series of chimes suddenly came from next door. First, they were low and soft, then suddenly slow and strong, gradually rising, faster, faster, and then with a "clang!" In an instant, it was like ten thousand horses galloping and ten thousand drums beating! At this time, I couldn't help but forget all my pain and annoyance. I only felt that my heart had followed the majestic sound of the chimes and flown to the heights of the sky. All the chaotic worldly affairs had left me far, far away!…

"Music is the key to heaven!" In recent years, after becoming neighbors with a friend who is proficient in music, I often have an indescribable experience and feeling, and I often say this to my friends.

I don't understand the various forms of music, so I won't talk about them for the time being, but I will just make a few small suggestions about music:

First, I think that when a patient is dying, it is better to play a quiet piece of music by his bedside than to cry and shout loudly in front of his bed.

Second, I think it might be a good idea for the country to encourage people to invent a new type of abacus, so that every time an abacus bead is moved, it can emit a burst of beautiful music.

Third, when many high-ranking officials are arguing and turning red in the face in some meeting, it is best for the host to announce a stop to the speeches and immediately replace them with various pleasant and melodious music. When everyone's red veins on their foreheads have receded, the meeting can continue.

### An Ancient Day

A day that has continued for thousands of years, a day that can never be abolished. Most of the pedestrians on the street have drowsy eyes, squeezing and crowding the street like a tide. They all seem quite exciting and quite happy, especially in Shanghai, which has been suffering for eight years. Everyone is very excited as this ancient custom returns.

The pain of the past, the old hatred and new grievances, are all temporarily abandoned. Under the stone "Protect My Coast," people crowded into the City God Temple, which had been separated for eight years. The atmosphere of incense confused the minds of many men and women. They each had different grand wishes, silently pleading in front of the Bodhisattva. The city corner stretched out its hand, silently accepting this heartfelt plea, this secret that they didn't want to reveal to the world. May the Bodhisattva be responsive and fulfill their long-cherished wishes.

The Zigzag Bridge is well? Broken railings everywhere, the wounds of劫 are impossible to hide. The green clothes under the bridge no longer aroused the interest of travelers to lean on the railing and watch. Huh! In front of the City God Temple, how many precious souls have been abandoned in front of the City God?

Walking up to Songyuelou—the ancient vegetarian restaurant—to re-taste the annual vegetarian meal has a special flavor. After eating, leaning against the window and looking out, the street is bustling and bustling. Who would believe that this place has undergone eight years of vicissitudes? Looking at the tightly closed door of "Inner Reading," I wonder if it is also so exciting inside! If it weren't for the warm sunshine reflecting on wisps of incense, forming layers of intangible colorful shadows, I really wouldn't know what day it was today, this ancient day!

### Crossing Qin Tower: Basha North Spring Counts Sails Late, Sitting Huangzhong Shang Yi Dream Window

— Zhu Jun

The waves twist around alone, the cold air is gray, and the ten thousand emeralds are obscured by mist. The ripples open the green bamboo, the stones fall, and the red rises. The clouds swallow and spit, the swallows return to peek into the curtains, whisper and discuss, and caress the eaves affectionately. I wonder how long the travelers have been away, thinking of the flag pavilion, and where is the beauty. The memories of ten thousand drops of weeping marks, and strands of red jade, have all entered the boundless forest. The cooking soup dissipates the heat, and the banyan tree roots condense, just like the pillars of old love. Afraid of secretly setting up by the railing, the ship comes on the river, and the setting sun extends. Watching the eastward flowing water, the lonely sail drifts away.

### Flying in Pairs (27)

— Zhao Qingge

"But, Master! You've been getting along well all these years, why are you suddenly getting serious now? Alas! It's all the fault of drinking! You're probably still drunk!" Mo Sheng's tone contained some complaints. Because he was afraid that Mo Taitai would retaliate tomorrow, and Mo Laoye would suffer. He knew that Mo Taitai would not let Mo Laoye off lightly.

Mo Laoye shook his head and sighed:

"I've been tolerating it as much as I can!"

Then a violent cough made Mo Laoye almost unable to breathe. Mo Sheng fed him some water, but it didn't help. Moreover, Mo Laoye began to shout that his lungs hurt and wanted Mo Sheng to massage him. Then Mo Sheng discovered that Mo Laoye's temperature was terrifyingly high! He couldn't help but exclaim:

"What? Master, you have a fever!"

Mo Laoye didn't pay attention to Mo Sheng's words, only felt that his chest was vibrating as if it was about to explode! He pounded it with his own hands. And gradually felt his breath blocked and his mind凝, as if a mountain fell down and pressed on him. He was sucked into a gloomy abyss!

"Master! Master! What, what's wrong with you?"

Mo Sheng shouted as he helped Mo Laoye up and used his fingers to pinch his philtrum (the lower end of the nose). After about a quarter of an hour, Mo Laoye woke up again and slowly recovered his light breathing.

Mo Laoye was sick!

At this time, Mo Taitai was still crying and scolding in the main room. Mo Sheng listened to these two symphonies of weeping and groaning. He didn't know what to do? In normal times, he might be able to ask Mo Taitai to find a doctor for Mo Laoye, or ask for some ginseng to make some soup for Mo Laoye to drink. But now he didn't dare, and he couldn't! Mo Taitai was angry, and if he told Mo Taitai, Mo Taitai would definitely not listen to reason. What to do? He was simply at a loss! He could only accompany Mo Laoye and worry about getting through this tormenting night.

Mo Laoye later fell asleep in confusion.

The next day, Mo Laoye's illness still hadn't improved, and he coughed up a lot of phlegm. This phenomenon caused Mo Sheng great fear. He had plucked up the courage to tell Mo Taitai, and as expected, Mo Taitai ignored him. Mo Sheng tossed and turned, and finally made his own decision and hired a doctor for Mo Laoye. After examination, the doctor said that Mo Laoye had tuberculosis and needed to nourish his lungs and strengthen his stomach. Only after a long period of rest, without labor or anger, could he gradually recover.

This was tantamount to announcing Mo Laoye's death sentence. He couldn't possibly have adequate and good medical treatment. Mo Taitai, out of resentment for Mo Laoye, wouldn't take out a penny. It was all up to Mo Sheng, and there was no way. As for rest, that was even more impossible. Mo Laoye's living environment was an environment of anger. Therefore, it seemed that Mo Laoye's illness had little hope of recovery.

Bao Ling and Li Hua took turns serving Mo Laoye, but whenever Mo Taitai saw them, they would inevitably be scolded. Because of this, the children and Mo Sheng were very distressed!

### Answers to Readers – Legal Questions

Feng Renling asks: In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), I borrowed 300 yuan in foreign currency from my relative, with a written IOU stating no interest. However, at that time, my relative insisted that I and my three children sign together as proof. Since the children were not present, I signed all three names myself. Now I want to return this amount, but my relative insists on calculating it based on the pre-war rice price, and mediation has been ineffective. Now I have several questions to ask: (1) Can this loan be calculated based on the pre-war rice price? (The IOU does not specify this.) (2) Since the children did not sign, will they have any repayment responsibility in the future? (3) To avoid future disputes if this debt is not repaid, can I publish a statement in the newspaper declaring it invalid after a certain period, or are there any remedies? (4) What is the statute of limitations for an IOU, how many years before it expires?

Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers: (1) Since the loan does not have a special agreement, the currency in general circulation at the time of the loan in 1938 is the same as the current currency. According to the law, it can be repaid in national currency at the original amount. The creditor cannot claim that it must be calculated based on the pre-war rice price. (2) Although the children did not sign the IOU, if they inherit the estate in the future, they will be jointly and severally liable according to the law. (3) If you want to repay this debt, you can first notify the creditor to receive it. If the receipt is delayed, you can deposit it according to the law, which will eliminate the debt relationship. (4) Ordinary claims expire after fifteen years of non-exercise.

Shen He asks: My grandparents borrowed 100 yuan in national currency from a certain family, with a copy of the deed for a 2.2% share of a house and land as collateral. It has been more than 20 years since then. My grandparents and father have passed away, and only my mother is alive. She is very unfamiliar with this matter. The certain family also only has a grandson alive. Now they are demanding 100 silver yuan from me, converted to legal currency (92,000 yuan in legal currency). I cannot afford such a huge amount. Please ask the following questions: (1) Does the law have such a provision? (2) If I cannot afford to repay, can they sue me in court? (3) How should I repay according to the law? (4) Can a new copy of the old deed for the house and land be made?

Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers: (1) The law does not have such a provision. (2) If a debt is not repaid, the creditor can sue in court, but they cannot make demands outside the law. (3) If the contract has no special agreement, this debt can be repaid in general national currency at the original amount according to the law. (4) Since the old copy of the deed for the house and land was used as collateral for the loan, it should be redeemed by repaying the debt, and a new deed cannot be made.
