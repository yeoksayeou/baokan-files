### The Military Reorganization Conference Continues - Agenda Enters Discussion Phase - Chairman Hosts Banquet for Generals Last Night

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Military Reorganization Conference, following the preparatory meeting on the 15th, held its second general meeting today. The Army Headquarters issued two public announcements at 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM. The conference agenda has entered the discussion phase. The central issues have been detailed in our newspaper's special dispatch. Today, our reporter obtained exceptionally exciting news: due to the conference's excellent achievements, the Chinese traditional principle of elite troops will transform from theory to reality, and soldiers'待遇 (treatment/compensation) will also be improved. Although some unpleasant news continues to arrive from the Northeast and Northwest, China's plan for troop reduction is still advancing on the correct path. By implementing the elite troops principle and improving soldiers'待遇 (treatment/compensation), which will be gradually implemented during the reorganization, reducing the current army size to below ninety divisions will not be difficult.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Military Reorganization Conference held its second general meeting at 9:00 AM today, attended by senior officers including He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, Cheng Qian, Gu Zhutong, Xue Yue, Liu Zhi, Zhang Fakui, and Tang Enbo, as well as group army commanders, division commanders, chiefs of staff, and political department directors at the division level and above, totaling over four hundred people. Throughout the day, the unit commanders and staff officers in attendance continued to give reports, concluding around 6:00 PM. It is heard that today's conference had a detailed discussion on improving soldiers' living conditions, planning for veterans' settlements, promoting military culture, strengthening troop training, and attending to the recreational needs of officers and soldiers. The meeting adjourned late tonight, and at nearly 7:00 PM, the generals accepted Chairman Jiang's invitation to a dinner at the Lizi Society auditorium. Ten tables were set up in a comb formation, personally arranged and supervised by Huang Renlin and Chen Xizeng. Each seat was numbered, and a detailed diagram with names and numbers was drawn, allowing the generals to find their seats according to the diagram in an orderly manner. The Chairman sat in the central seat facing the stage, above which hung a small silver screen. It is heard that a movie will be shown to entertain the generals. After the Chairman took his seat, the generals all stood at attention to pay their respects. The meal consisted of two dishes, one soup, and one bowl of rice, just enough to satisfy hunger and in line with the principles of frugality. Chairman Jiang delivered a brief speech tonight.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Military Reorganization Conference will be extended until the 21st. It is heard that several senior generals will return to their posts ahead of schedule. In addition, the Army Headquarters, in response to a request from Nanjing reporters, will, after the Military Reorganization Conference, arrange for a joint reception for reporters by the attending generals and answer their questions. The Nanjing reporters have entrusted Director Chen Xizeng to request a meeting with the Chairman, and Chen has agreed to request this on their behalf.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Military Reorganization Conference is scheduled to hold group discussions on the 18th regarding reorganization cases, such as determining the army organizational structure, unifying the national defense force organizational structure, reorganizing officer ranks during reorganization, providing preferential treatment for officers and soldiers who are demobilized through re-training, and settling the families of fallen soldiers and the wounded soldiers. Attendees expressed high confidence in the nationalization of the military through this Military Reorganization, and they believe that the great cause of nation-building will be completed soon.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The Military Reorganization Conference continued today, with unit commanders reporting on the cessation of conflict between the Kuomintang and Communist parties in various areas, but details were not formally released.

### Ministry of Finance Temporarily Approves Jiangsu Provincial Government - Monthly Allocation of 400 Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 17th] Jiangsu Province was devastated during the eight years of enemy occupation in Chongqing and has not recovered to its former state. After the victory, the government, in consideration of the people's difficulties, exempted field taxes and other taxes, resulting in widespread financial difficulties in various counties. As a temporary measure, the provincial government previously stipulated temporary loan measures, but due to slight negligence in implementation, it often led to apportionments, easily criticized by society, with a significant impact. It is heard that the provincial government has recently been granted approval from the Ministry of Finance for a temporary monthly allocation of 400 million yuan to enrich the finances of counties and cities. It has also issued a notice to all counties that once the above funds are allocated, the temporary loan measures will be abolished immediately.

### Soviet Reply on Troop Withdrawal Plan - Reportedly Submitted to Foreign Minister Wang in Nanjing

[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] National attention is now focused on the Nine Northeastern Provinces. The attitude of newspapers here opposing any unreasonable demands from the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly firm. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie went to Nanjing, reportedly to submit the Soviet Union's reply regarding the troop withdrawal plan to Chairman Chiang. According to reliable sources, China's attitude is to be prepared to grant the people of Soviet Northeastern provinces most-favored-nation treatment, but refusing to make any concessions beyond the Sino-Soviet Treaty.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] It is reported that informal discussions between China and the Soviet Union on the Northeast issue, as well as the lack of accurate reporting on the situation in the Northeast, have attracted great attention from the American authorities. A recent telegram from China states that Special Envoy Marshall will soon return to Washington to report to President Truman. However, this information has not been officially confirmed.

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 16th] Dr. Wellington Koo stated that he had discussed the domestic situation in China with President Truman.

[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] A correspondent of this agency states: General Du Yuming's National Army has occupied Liaozhong, fifty miles southwest of Shenyang. Military figures here believe that this action is aimed at resolving the communist army's constant threat to the KMT's right wing. Furthermore, the communist forces in Rehe and South Manchuria have continued to advance in two directions in the past half month: (1) from Rehe towards the eastern part of Liaoning Province, (2) from Jilin towards the eastern part of Liaoning and the Korean border.

### President Sun Flies to Guangzhou

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] President Sun, along with Vice Foreign Minister Liu Xie and others, arrived here from Chongqing this afternoon.

After disembarking, Sun immediately met with reporters at the Executive Headquarters, answering questions on party issues, constitutional amendments, and politics.

### Constitutional Draft Review Committee - Discusses Central System
Experts advocate maintaining the Five-Power Constitution

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The Constitutional Draft Review Committee held its third meeting at 9:20 AM today to discuss the central political system. Twenty-three people attended, including Dai Xiujun. Sun Ke chaired the meeting, and Lei Zhen served as the secretary-general. Although the agenda for today was the central political system, because it involved the issue of the parliamentary system, many committee members and experts fully expressed their research results on the advantages and disadvantages of the separation of powers system and parliamentary politics, citing the political systems of various countries. There was considerable debate over the need for a parliamentary system. Most experts advocated implementing the separation of powers system based on the theory of the Five-Power Constitution, so that the government would be capable and the people would have rights, with the five powers being exercised independently and emphasizing their connection. Dai Xiujun and Lin Bin held this view. Lin also pointed out that if the principles of the Political Consultative Conference are followed, although the power of the Legislative Yuan would be increased, it could interfere with the administration at any time, which would reduce the government's ability. Chuan Sinnian, in principle, agreed with the points of the central government decided by the Political Consultative Conference. Sun Ke explained that the Five-Power theory is based on the teachings of the National Father, but the method of its application can be studied. Zhang Junmai said: The government must have power, but the people must also have the right to supervise. Wu Jingxiong agreed that "cooperation" should be the soul of the constitution.

[Another Dispatch] The Constitutional Draft Review Committee held its fourth meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, continuing to discuss the central political system. Chairman Sun Ke, Wang Yunwu, and Zhou Binglin spoke in succession. Zhou advocated that the central government should adopt a presidential system, with the president and the Executive Yuan as the highest administrative organs of the state. Finally, the chairman announced: Compile the opinions of all parties and hand them over to the Consultative Sub-committee for discussion and decision. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM. The next meeting is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 18th.

### Beiping Universities Hold - Expanded Current Affairs Lectures

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] This afternoon, universities here held expanded current affairs lectures.

There were many posters pasted in the venue, indicating prior arrangements. However, the content was very mixed. It is heard that lectures of this nature will continue to be held in the future.

### Changchun Quietly Passes the Lantern Festival - Prices Soar, Military Issues Unresolved, Spring Plowing Delayed, Rural Areas Face Crisis

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The Lunar Lantern Festival passed quietly, adding only a little sorrow here and leaving no trace. Northeast customs are like those in other parts of China. Every year at the beginning of the year, there are activities such as Yangge dance, Gaoqiao performances, and dragon lantern shows, with singing and dancing that continue day and night until the Lantern Festival. This is one of the happiest days of the year for the people. After this, they must reorganize their farm tools and prepare for spring plowing. Under the high pressure of the enemy puppet regime for fourteen years, the people of the Northeast were depressed and were unable to express their feelings. Any festive holiday had few spontaneous celebrations. This year, although the country celebrates recovery, the military period has not yet passed, and the general long-suppressed mood is still difficult to release, so the Lantern Festival atmosphere is rarely seen on the streets and alleys, and no sound of firecrackers is heard. There are two things that people often talk about now: one is the rising prices, and the other is the approaching spring plowing. The former is difficult to resolve before transportation is fully restored and industry and commerce are generally revived. The latter is even more serious. The number of oxen and horses used for plowing in the Northeast countryside has been greatly reduced due to years of requisition by the enemy puppet regime, and many farm tools have been lost. This situation continues today, and the rural order, which has been disrupted by several upheavals, such as manpower and finance, cannot be restored in a short period of time. Spring comes late in the north, and wheat planting is usually done around the Qingming Festival. After the Lantern Festival, fertilization must begin, but the situation is such that everything is difficult to start. If spring plowing is unfortunately delayed, there will be a major problem with the people's food this fall. This is the real crisis facing the Northeast countryside. Facing the upcoming disaster, it is no wonder that the Lantern Festival quietly passed.

### Nanjing Women's Circles Prepare - To Welcome Madame Chiang

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Huang Renlin, Director-General of the Lizi Society, arrived in Nanjing at 10:10 AM this morning.

### KMT Central Committee Members from Various Parts of North China Will Arrive in Beiping - To Exchange Opinions on the Current Situation - Central Committee Members Remaining in Nanjing May Fly to Chongqing on the Same Plane

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] The KMT Central Committee members in various parts of North China have recently received a notice that the Second Plenary Session will be held on schedule and are scheduled to go south to attend in the near future, and will first exchange opinions on the current situation in Beiping.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The KMT Central Committee members remaining in Nanjing held their third meeting on the evening of the 16th. The meeting was attended by Central Executive Committee members Zhang Daofan and Ma Chaojun, Central Committee members Deng Jiayan, Shen Huilian, Zhu Jingnong, Zhang Mojun, Li Shizhen, Ma Yuanfang, Ma Xingye, Gan Jiaxin, Zhuo Hengzhi, and Cheng Siyuan. The meeting was chaired by Deng Jiayan, continued to study issues related to reforming party affairs and politics, and Zhang Changwei reported on the situation of studying this issue in Chongqing. After three hours, a final decision was made to summarize the various opinions and draft three proposals, and to decide on various matters related to going to Chongqing for the meeting. The KMT Central Committee members remaining in Nanjing may fly to Chongqing on the same plane to attend.

### Zhang Xinfu and Others Tragically Killed - Government Decides to Give Them a Public Funeral - The Ministry of Economic Affairs Decides to Recall Other Technicians

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] It is learned that, in order to encourage loyalty, the government has decided to give a public funeral to Zhang Xinfu and the seven engineers who died in the takeover of the Fushun coal mine, so as to commend them. It has also been decided that after the Fushun coal mine is officially taken over, bronze statues will be erected there for Zhang and others, and that the Li Zijieshi station where they were killed will be renamed Zhang Xinfu Station, so as to last for a thousand years.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Related sources told reporters that Zhang Xinfu, who was responsible for taking over the Fushun coal mine in the Northeast, and his entourage, were killed by so-called bandits, suffering more than forty stab wounds, in an extremely tragic state. Zhang was responsible for taking over the Northeast's industries and mines on behalf of Sun Yueqi. He was a native of Jilin. His death undoubtedly dealt a great blow to the takeover work. Chairman Jiang has ordered the allocation of one million yuan for Zhang's funeral. It is heard that the technical personnel dispatched to the Northeast by the Ministry of Economic Affairs have been ordered to return one after another, and others have been dispatched to work in Beiping, Hankou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Taiwan. An economic official told reporters that he had seen a weather forecast telegram stating that if the weather does not improve within three or four months, there will be major storms in the Northeast.

It is heard that although Chen and others anticipated their death was near, their appetite had increased greatly. Chu could swallow four bowls of rice each meal, and he looked around like a clown when boarding the train.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, and Chen Lingjun, escorted from Nanjing to Suzhou, arrived at the Jiangsu High Court at 3:00 PM this afternoon. After the chief justice, Han, opened the trial, they were detained in the High Court jail in the Qianjie area, and visits were prohibited.

### Editorial: Playing with Firewood to Put Out a Fire

Things in the world often turn out unexpectedly. The one who suggests "bending the chimney and moving the firewood" may not be recognized for their merits. Only those who rush to put out the fire when someone is "burnt and scarred" have the opportunity to be called "esteemed guests." This old Chinese fable aims to satirize people who deliberately ignore a small spark, hoping to become "esteemed guests" later. But regardless, the person who wants to be an "esteemed guest" eventually braves the danger of being "burnt and scarred," steps forward, and extinguishes the spreading disaster. Who would have thought that in today's progressive era, when the situation has already reached the point of requiring being burnt and scarred to solve, and rushing to spray water to put out the fire is barely enough, there are still people who want to learn the trick of "playing with firewood to put out a fire" and try their hand? Isn't that incredibly strange!

Leaving other matters aside, let's discuss the labor strikes and commodity price issues that everyone is focused on. If we continue to handle these problems using the methods of the past, in our humble opinion, we really cannot see any genuinely effective solutions, only "playing with firewood to put out a fire."

Let's first talk about labor strikes. It is only right that laborers demand wage increases because commodity prices are high and life is difficult. It is also reasonable for employers to say that their expenses are high, their costs are expensive, and they cannot afford the burden. When the two sides disagree, there are labor strikes. And the government remains impartial, hoping to coordinate. Thus, they tirelessly persuade and mediate, and their spirit of hard work and bearing grievances is well known to the public. However, in recent months, labor strikes have continued to erupt one after another, with no peaceful days. What is the reason for this? To put it bluntly, it is not surprising at all; it is indeed due to the continuous increase in commodity prices. Because commodity prices are soaring, those strikes that were fortunately resolved and calmed down last time soon have new demands, with laborers saying that what they earn is not enough to meet their needs. Unfortunately, it seems that few government officials understand this simple principle.

Several government officials do not understand that the government is a whole, and policies should also be a complete set. Instead, they uphold the saying "Each sweeps the snow from his own door, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs" as a golden rule. They think that a major labor strike is the responsibility of the department in charge, that the central government only asks the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the municipal government only asks the Bureau of Social Affairs. It seems that these people, with their empty words and leveraging personal connections, can solve everything and bring peace. Little do they know that today they persuade for wage increases, and tomorrow they order work resumption. They work hard every day, trying to please everyone. Even if they are satisfied and solve everything, if commodity prices do not stop rising and laborers cannot barely make a living, then the method of increasing wages and salaries will still not quell labor strikes. To truly quell labor strikes, we must quickly start by stabilizing commodity prices, and to stabilize commodity prices, we must first tighten the money supply and increase production. But when it comes to commodity prices, currency, and production, etc., these are beyond the capacity of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Social Affairs to handle. We dare to boldly say that if the government at this moment still cannot come up with a decisive commodity price policy and monetary policy to address the root cause, and only hopes to let the "peacemaker" Ministry of Social Affairs and Bureau of Social Affairs circle around "increasing wages and salaries" to quell labor strikes, then labor strikes will never be quelled, or even more labor strikes will occur. The reason is simple: after increasing wages and salaries, expenses and costs increase, and employers will naturally raise the prices of their finished products, and commodity prices will rise accordingly. When general commodity prices rise, the wages and salaries that laborers previously increased will not be enough. In this cyclical pursuit, how can labor strikes be quelled? To put it as a joke: Isn't this playing with firewood to put out a fire?

Therefore, to put it thoroughly, today, not only in Shanghai, but wherever labor strikes occur, we cannot solely blame the employer or the laborer, and even more so, we cannot solely blame the Ministry of Social Affairs or the Bureau of Social Affairs. The lack of effective measures in the entire national economy and finance is the cause of all labor strikes. Therefore, we cannot but discuss the issue of commodity prices. Our newspaper's editorial on the 14th pointed out long ago that the recent crazy speculation in the market has stimulated the soaring of commodity prices, and the soaring of commodity prices has further induced crazy speculation. Who is responsible for these two recurring social scourges? There is no need to investigate further. What we need to calmly discuss today is what measures the authorities have taken in the past three or four days.

The Chairman is indeed most concerned about this matter and most hopes to have a thorough and permanent solution to suppressing commodity prices. On the day he left Shanghai, he also specially summoned relevant government leaders and business leaders, earnestly inquired, and gave instructions. This shows that the Chairman is genuinely concerned about the people's suffering. The Finance Ministry's Special Commissioner in Beijing and Shanghai conducted a swift and thorough inspection of securities firms and is said to have found more than a hundred suspected of speculation, which will soon be brought to justice. The municipal government and the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office also separately convened meetings with various parties and will make efforts to suppress commodity prices. It is possible that some results have been achieved.

But we must especially remind you! The commodity price issue is a national issue, not a local matter. This is the first point. Shanghai has always been the leading city, and Shanghai is now also the place with the most mobile capital. Therefore, any movement in Shanghai will inevitably affect other places. This is the second point. Just look at the rising gold prices and commodity prices in various places in recent days, and you will know that this statement is not false. Because of this, we believe that the authorities' actions in the past three or four days are not enough. Suppressing speculation without eliminating the objects of speculation, Shanghai gold and silver then has a "black market!" Although Shanghai has this incomplete suppression, other places do not even have this. Thus, in the north, there are Tianjin and Beijing; in the south, there are Fujian and Guangdong; and in the west, there are Kunming and Chongqing. Gold prices and commodity prices are still generally rising. Shanghai suppresses the black market, and Chongqing suspends the sale of gold, and also says it is a temporary measure. Isn't this deliberately making gold desirable but unattainable for the people, causing the masses to rush to the market to compete for purchases, creating an even higher price in the "black market," and thereby further stimulating the soaring of general commodity prices? The government sells gold, originally wanting to withdraw legal currency to tighten the money supply and suppress commodity prices. But let us ask, what is the effect today? If there is not much effect, why not decisively change it, and, as current commentators have said, repeatedly announce that gold is state-owned to eliminate speculation? If it is believed that it is indeed effective, then it should be sold simultaneously in various places and the gold sales policy should be stepped up. Why was it previously limited to Chongqing and the interior, resulting in the price difference between gold in Chongqing and Shanghai, giving people opportunities for speculation? It can be seen that even in terms of suppressing speculation, the current methods are still equivalent to "playing with firewood to put out a fire!"

Extending the discussion, the rise in commodity prices is now half due to the stimulation of gold prices and crazy speculation, and half due to the expansion of currency and the lack of materials. Therefore, only focusing on eliminating gold speculation will not be effective in stabilizing commodity prices, and the old methods of "price limits" and "negotiated prices" that have been tried in Chongqing may not become today's "tried and tested prescriptions." The fundamental solution is for everyone in the country to earnestly implement tight money supply and save their "purchasing power." We are greatly moved by the three emergency orders issued by the Japanese government to curb inflation, as reported by the United Press in Tokyo on the 16th. The main points are nothing more than restricting consumption and stabilizing currency values. Our government must have this determination, and the people must also have this awareness, in order to have hope of stabilizing commodity prices. Therefore, at this moment, the government should quickly and decisively cut staff and reduce government spending, drastically merge redundant agencies, reorganize the army, and transform soldiers into workers, while ensuring that production projects and important facilities are never added with new government offices or redundant personnel, which would increase the expenditure of the national treasury. As for the increased purchasing power of the people due to inflation, it should be contributed to the country and saved in the national treasury by expanding good taxes and issuing public bonds. The specific measures should be explained in detail, but the policy should not be changed. Furthermore, quickly resuming work in all factories and selling large quantities of confiscated materials at low prices are even more essential and well known to everyone. The problem lies in the slow and inactive implementation. From now on, we must thoroughly correct this and never be complacent again. Also, as Zhao Tonglian's special article published in our newspaper yesterday suggests, the establishment of the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation can alleviate the current difficulties of industrial circles in purchasing foreign exchange, facilitate the import and utilization of foreign capital, raise the long-term funds needed by factories, guide mobile capital to the right path of productive enterprises, establish international credit, and promote China's international trade. The method is excellent and the intention is good, and it is one of the best recent suggestions for stabilizing currency values and supporting production. If the authorities value and adopt it, it is believed that it will be a major contribution to suppressing commodity prices. If the government still only treats the headache when it hurts and treats the foot when it hurts, doing some partial actions branch by branch, and does not make a comprehensive effort in tightening the money supply, stabilizing currency values, promoting production, and restricting consumption, then the so-called work of suppressing commodity prices will ultimately be like "playing with firewood to put out a fire," with no great hope.

### Soviet Union Deploys a Large Espionage Network Within Canada

Evidence of a Fifth Column-like Structure Obtained; Staff's Nervous Breakdown Reveals the Operation

[United Press International, Ottawa, 16th] Canadian newspapers reported tonight that, according to reliable sources, the Soviet Union is deploying a vast espionage network within Canada, with a nature "similar to a Fifth Column," and evidence has been obtained by Canadian counter-intelligence agencies. The RCMP are currently conducting widespread searches, and dozens of people may be detained before the searches are completed. Based on information leaked by those already detained, the scope of this espionage organization is vast, and what is particularly noteworthy is that its plans are for the future. Most of those who joined the Soviet espionage organization did so out of ignorance. Initially, the information they provided was mostly common knowledge and nothing extraordinary. However, once they were fully involved, they were under great pressure and had no choice but to continue to be used. It is not yet known whether detrimental information has been leaked. According to informants, preliminary reconnaissance began months ago, when a Canadian working for the Soviet Union had a nervous breakdown, and the operation was exposed. When the Canadian decided to confess, he returned home one night and found that his house had been shot at.

### American Officials, Large and Small, Implicated in Atomic Secrets Leak Case

[Reuters, Ottawa, 16th] An authoritative source said: The work of arresting suspects for leaking classified information has not yet ended. The arrests are not limited to Ottawa and have been launched in other parts of Canada. The rumor that 22 people have been arrested is purely speculation. It is also believed here that it is possible to search for suspects in the United States. Rumors have it that American officials, large and small, are also related to this case, and at least one senior government official bears significant responsibility.

[United Press International, Washington, 17th] Senator Breathed, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today called on the authorities to conduct an immediate investigation to determine whether Americans were involved in the "leak of classified information" case. He said: "I know that the leak discovered in Canada, following the clues, may involve the United States. If anyone is involved, the responsible agency should immediately investigate."

[United Press International, Ottawa, 16th] Canada, as a country that jointly holds atomic bomb secrets with the United Kingdom and the United States, has today taken action to prevent the further leakage of these secrets and confidential information. This leak of atomic secrets is Canada's first major espionage case. At least 22 people have been arrested, some of whom are related to the National Institute of Science, which transmits atomic information. All those detained will be taken to Ottawa and interrogated by a court, which was announced by Prime Minister King on Monday and will be presided over by judges Tissot and Kellogg. Authoritative sources believe that the Soviet Union has obtained this atomic information, but it has not been stated whether it involves the secrets of manufacturing atomic bombs. The Soviet Embassy here has not made any statements, and Ambassador Zarubin is also not at his post. The Canadian Mounted Police have been conducting searches for several days, and yesterday's arrest of suspects was just the beginning. The arrest of suspects is also different from usual and is done "in the name of Minister of Justice St. Laurent, issuing orders to detain and await trial." Most of those detained were born in Canada, but not all are federal government employees. Canadian newspapers say that as a result of this investigation, the Chalk River atomic plant has been strictly guarded. The radar laboratory near Ottawa has also been regarded as a "secret" weapon again and strictly protected.

[Agence France-Presse, Montreal, Canada, 16th] Several senior Canadian military officers have been taken to Ottawa by special plane for interrogation in connection with the "secret leak of atomic bombs" case. Newspapers say that this case has had international repercussions.

### Truman Knew of Security Leak Long Ago

[US News Service, Washington, 17th] White House Press Secretary Ross stated that President Truman had known about the leak of atomic bomb secrets in Canada for some time.

Since then, President Truman has been continuously receiving intelligence from the State Department regarding the matter. Truman declined to comment on the issue.

### Goal of Spies: Obtain Radar Secrets

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th Dispatch] According to previous dispatches, personnel currently and formerly working for the Canadian government leaked secret information related to the atomic bomb. However, according to recent news from Canada, the primary goal of the spies was to obtain radar secrets, intending to acquire secrets of radar equipment designed for Arctic aviation and defense against potential air raids from the Arctic region. Canada plays a major role in the development of radar because it must defend its vast and undefended northern territories, extending to and beyond the Arctic Circle. This argument supports the above statement. Canadian Army and U.S. observers yesterday began an 81-day Arctic overland patrol to test the use of radar in Arctic conditions to assist navigation and to test other equipment. It is reported that Canada is paying close attention to the possibility of using radar to warn against atomic bomb attacks (which may come from the Arctic region) and the possibility of using radar for target acquisition of any attacking aircraft. The U.S. is paying close attention to these possibilities, as evidenced by the recent visit of U.S. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower to Canada. A United Press correspondent stationed in Ottawa stated that an unnamed Canadian minister indicated that the Soviet Union is the country related to the intelligence leak.

[United Press, London, 16th] The United Nations Security Council continued its discussion of the issue of British and French troops stationed in Syria and Lebanon tonight. The U.S. proposal was passed by a vote of seven to two. Soviet representative Vyshinsky requested to invoke the veto power, which was used for the first time to overturn the American proposal. According to the U.S. proposal, the withdrawal of British and French troops could be resolved through direct negotiations between the permanent members of the council. During the vote, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault abstained, but recognized that according to the UN Charter, Vyshinsky could invoke the veto power. The council expressed the U.S. proposal. The council then cleared the agenda and immediately adjourned, to reconvene in New York on March 21st of this year.

### Using Comparative Linguistics to Explain Chinese

[Our Dispatch] Dr. Luo Yimin, professor of Chinese language and literature at Aurora University, gave a lecture yesterday (the 17th) at 3:00 PM at the Wu Liande Hall of the Museum Road, on "Using Modern Comparative Linguistics to Explain the Secrets of Chinese Language and Literature." The initiator was the Sino-British Cultural Association, and many Chinese allies attended the lecture.

### Chinese Language Has Internationality

Professor Luo particularly emphasized that all scholars should cooperate for the sake of promoting science and knowledge, and for the sake of increasing human happiness. This is also true in Chinese language and literature. If there were no great contributions in Chinese language and literature from countries such as England, America, France, the Soviet Union, and Sweden, Chinese language and literature would not be in its current state. Professor Luo said that his own linguistic achievements would not be what they are today.

### Studying Chinese Does Not Drive One Crazy

Professor Luo revealed a completely new side of Chinese, especially using a humorous perspective to explain the misconceptions that foreigners have about Chinese. He especially cited the belief that any foreigner who studies Chinese must risk going crazy. He firmly believes that his more than 20 years of research on Chinese have not only not driven him crazy, but have also strengthened his spirit and understanding. He hoped that the audience would criticize whether his subsequent statements were filled with elements of madness.

### Two Languages, Same Feelings

Professor Luo proved that Chinese is not the only language in the world, and is not unrelated to other languages in the world. On the contrary, he recognized that Chinese is greatly related to other languages in the world. He described how he suddenly realized that he could use foreign language dictionaries to explain the secrets of Chinese language and literature. He especially used the word "葱" (cōng, green onion) as an example. The "葱" character comes from the grass radical and does not take its sound from "愈" (yù). The character "囱" (chuāng) originally meant "总" (zǒng, general), but the ancients did not understand that "总" and "葱" had the same meaning, and thought that the character "囱" only contributed the sound of the "葱" character and did not contribute any meaning. However, if we ask comparative linguistics to guide us, this is completely wrong. "葱" in English is represented by Onion. If we look up the word Onion in an English language dictionary, we know that its origin is from the Latin Onio, which has the same origin as the English word Union (总). Since the English (葱) meaning and the (总) meaning have the same origin, and the Chinese "葱" character contains "囱" which contributes sound, it must also contribute meaning. Ancient European farmers and Chinese farmers saw the same thing when they saw "葱", so they had the same feelings about it, and used all kinds of special types to name it as "葱" which had a comprehensive meaning.

### Human Thoughts Prove Similar

The character "西" (xī, west) is the same as the character "东" (dōng, east) and also has coincidences with foreign languages. The ancient form of the Chinese character "西" originally contained the meaning of "栖居" (qījū, dwelling), while the English "West" comes from the root "Vas", which originally meant "楼居" (lóujú, dwelling in a building) and "休息" (xiūxi, rest), because the west is where the sun rests. But even more interesting is the character "东." Professor Luo spoke about this character at length. According to the Kangxi Dictionary and the Zhonghua Da Zidian, the original meaning of the character "东" is "春季" (chūnjì, spring), such as "东君" (Dōngjūn), not "东方之君" (the ruler of the east), but "春之君" (the ruler of spring). This word is completely in line with the English East, which originally had the meaning of Easter. This proves that the development of human thought is very similar, and convinces us that all mankind is originally the same.

Finally, Professor Luo said that Chinese is the most interesting language in the world, because it is the only language that has developed the "hieroglyphic system" to the extreme.

### Labor Center Station to Investigate Labor Service Equipment

[Dahua News] The city's Labor Center Station, in order to compile statistics on the labor courses and equipment of various primary and secondary schools, and the qualifications of labor teachers, has specially prepared investigation forms, which will be distributed to various schools for immediate completion and return to the station for collection and submission to the Education Bureau for record.

A meeting will be held to commemorate him at a later date.

### All Circles in This City Launch Freedom Association, Launch New National Construction Movement, General Assembly Elects 27 Preparatory Committee Members, Passes Declaration Welcoming All Circles to Participate

The Freedom Association, aimed at promoting the realization of the four freedoms, held its inaugural meeting at the Pudong Fellow Association yesterday afternoon. More than 200 people attended (all freelancers). Xi Yushu served as the chairman and first reported on the process of launching the association, saying that the goal is to realize national freedom, political freedom, economic freedom, and freedom of thought, unite the forces of freedom and democracy from all sides, and serve the interests of the people. The association is a purely social and academic group and welcomes people from all walks of life to actively participate. Ju Shaoyi, Wang Genzhong, Hu Qiuyuan and others then spoke successively. A preparatory committee of 27 members, including Xu Yongzuo, Zhao Chuanding, Wang Genzhong, Xi Yushu, Luo Qinghua, Wang Qizhang, Cui Wanqiu, Wang Yansong, Hu Qiuyuan, Xu Xiaochu, etc., was immediately elected to be responsible for preparing for the inaugural meeting and reviewing the organizational charter and other matters. Finally, the founders' declaration of the Freedom Association was passed, and it was decided to hold the inaugural meeting within a week. The key points of the declaration are excerpted as follows:

"Through this war, freedom and democracy have become an irresistible tide. This is truly what is called following the principles of heaven, responding to human feelings, conforming to the world's tides, and meeting the needs of the people. We have paid the most tragic price in human history for this war of resistance. After the victory, China's international status has not increased significantly, domestic order has not been fully restored, transportation and production have stagnated, prices are still soaring, workers and farmers are unemployed, and public education personnel are also struggling on the brink of starvation. As for administrative efficiency, military discipline, official conduct, and general moral conditions, all cause people to worry. We should not and cannot stand by and watch this situation.

We can say that 90% of the Chinese people, especially the general workers, farmers, common people, industrialists, business people, and freelancers, all hope to transform the status quo and take the path of true national freedom. Everyone hopes that China can establish an enlightened and progressive system in a state of peaceful unity and solidarity, and build a well-regulated democratic country. Everyone opposes autocracy and corruption, but also opposes division and chaos. This is the conscientious demand of the majority of Chinese people, but because there is no force and no organization, the country cannot see a stable force. Under this understanding, the Freedom Association came into being.

The purpose of the Freedom Association is to unite a force of freedom and democracy, stand on the position of the country and the people, and establish a standard of what is public and what is private. Our main tasks are threefold: First, through free discussion and the freedom of publication, we will put forward fair propositions on the current state affairs. Second, we will use our own strength to serve the interests of the people. Third, we will cooperate with anyone who supports our proposition so that our proposition can be realized through legislative procedures or administrative measures. We oppose conspiracies and violence, and we will use public opinion and legal methods to achieve our goals."
