### After Being Away from the Capital for More Than Two Months, He is as Healthy as Ever: Chairman Returns to the Capital by Plane in the Rain. Chief of General Staff Chen and Others Stand in Line at the Airport to Greet Him

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 26th] Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing by the "Meiling" special plane from 贛 County at 2:10 PM on the 26th. After boarding, the plane was delayed for 20 minutes for temporary mechanical inspection before taking off. Nanjing's weather was affected by a typhoon, with wind and rain all day. The rain was particularly heavy in the afternoon, but those waiting to welcome the Chairman arrived at Ming Palace Airport before 5 PM. Cars were neatly lined up outside the airport, and the Chairman's guards also arrived early to make arrangements. A quarter of an hour before the "Meiling" landed, the rain gradually subsided. At 6:10 PM, the "Meiling" plane descended at low altitude and immediately landed. At 6:18 PM, the engine stopped. Those welcoming the Chairman by the plane included Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou, Acting Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, Commander Zhang Zhen, Director Tang Zong, Director Chen Xizeng, and the Chairman's son Chiang Wei-kuo, all lined up. Chiang Ching-kuo, the Chairman's son, walked ahead as the door opened, followed by Director Yu Jishi, and then the Chairman descended from the plane. The Chairman was in excellent spirits, wearing a dark blue long robe, a black cloak, and black soft leather shoes. He smiled and nodded to those welcoming him. Chief of General Staff Chen and his group stood at attention to pay their respects. The Chairman repeatedly said, "Good." Chief of General Staff Chen first said: "The weather in Nanjing is not good today." The Chairman replied: "Good, very good." As he walked to the car, he saw a group of reporters waiting to greet him. The Chairman paid special attention and paused for a minute, smiling at the reporters and saying, "Thank you!" He then boarded car number 00038, and Chiang Ching-kuo accompanied him out of the airport. The Chairman left the capital in the heat of summer and returned in the autumn rain, as healthy as ever. The period of absence from the capital was two months and twelve days. (He left the capital on July 14th, stayed in 牯 Mountain for 69 days, and inspected Jiangxi for 5 days.)

[Report from Central News Agency, 贛 County, 26th] Chairman Chiang left here by special plane to return to Nanjing today amidst the enthusiastic farewell of the people. At 10:00 AM, the Chairman personally inspected the Commissioner's Office. When he arrived at the County Government, more than a hundred representatives from all sectors, including leading figures and gentry, respectfully presented a "Long Live" banner on behalf of all the people. The Chairman gladly accepted it and gave an impromptu speech, elaborating on the importance of Ganzhou in terms of culture and terrain. He mentioned that the previous construction had already laid a foundation, and he hoped that the people and the local government would continue their efforts to build Jiangxi. The Chairman then inspected the County Party Headquarters and left the city by car. From the County Government to the Gong River, a distance of four miles, the people lined the streets to bid farewell, with firecrackers sounding continuously along the way. The Chairman's car moved slowly, and the old and young alike vied for a glimpse of the Chairman's demeanor. After the Chairman boarded the boat, the people still gathered on the riverbank, watching and cheering endlessly. The Chairman repeatedly raised his hand to thank the people for their enthusiasm and love. After crossing the river, the Chairman, accompanied by Yu Jishi, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Wang Lingji, took a short rest at Tongtian Rock and climbed to admire the scenery. They then had lunch together. At 2:00 PM, they arrived at the airport and took off for Nanjing by "Meiling" special plane at 2:10 PM.

[Report from Central News Agency, Nanchang, 26th] At 3:00 PM today, two planes came from the south. Among them, Chairman's plane "Meiling" flew directly north, and Chairman Wang Lingji of Jiangxi took another plane back here.

### The Chairman Visited Dayu Yesterday to Pay Respects at the Place of Wang Yangming's Death

[Report from Central News Agency, Nanchang, 26th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Wang Lingji and Chiang Ching-kuo, went to Xiannvbu in Qinglong Township, Dayu (Nanan), at 9:00 AM on the 26th to pay respects at the place where Mr. Wang Yangming passed away. Xiannvbu is located on the bank of the Zhang River. Mr. Yangming came to Jiangxi from Guangdong in the seventh year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty and died of illness in a boat here, which is now 418 years ago. The Chairman read Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living" in his childhood and deeply admired his theory of innate knowledge, so he made a special trip to pay respects on the second day of his visit to Jiangxi to express his sincerity and respect. At 3:00 PM, the Chairman's car crossed Xiaomei Pass to Damei 　. Damei Pass is located at the intersection of Jiangxi and Guangdong, on the 　 of Dayu Mountain. The terrain is treacherous. The Chairman climbed up the steps from Guangdong Province and entered Jiangxi Province. He talked to the residents and learned that when the enemy invaded and occupied Damei 　, they cut down plum trees wherever they went. The Chairman then instructed the Dayu County Government to plant more new plum trees to preserve the plum forest, 　 to prevent damage. He then left Da 　 and returned to 　 　 to inspect the Dayu and Nankang County Governments. When the people heard that the Chairman had arrived, they set off firecrackers and cheered enthusiastically, the situation was fervent.

### Ambassador Stuart Makes Further Mediation Efforts: Joint Letter to Zhou Enlai Hoping for Early Return to Nanjing. Ambassador Stuart is Scheduled to Visit Chairman Chiang Tomorrow

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 26th] The peace talks are still at a standstill on the surface today. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart still hope with great sincerity that the Communist Party will change its insistence and hope that Zhou Enlai will return to Nanjing as soon as possible to jointly promote progress. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart met twice in the morning, presumably to review the talks with the Communist Party in recent days. In the afternoon, Ambassador Stuart went to meet Wang Bingnan again to inquire about the Communist Party's attitude of silence in the past two days. Mr. Marshall met him first, followed by a meeting with Ambassador Stuart, which ended at 4:00 PM. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly sent a letter to the Communist Party today, which was personally handed over to Wang Bingnan by Ambassador Stuart, who was instructed to forward it to Zhou Enlai. It is generally believed that this document contains the opinions of Marshall and Stuart on further mediation of the talks. At 7:00 PM, Ambassador Stuart attended a dinner hosted by Soviet Ambassador Petrov. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall will visit Chairman Chiang on the 28th.

[Report from Reuters, Nanjing, 26th] The political situation, which has been gradually deteriorating for several weeks, may have some opportunities after Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing. Marshal Marshall has informed the Communist Party of the answers before and after their request to reopen the military three-person group meeting. After exchanging views with the Chairman, he can put forward his suggestions. It is generally believed that the government will now propose a compromise action, which will not cause any losses to the government, either militarily or in terms of land. The victory of the National Army in North China can greatly enhance the government's power in the negotiations. The Communist Party's current action is to adopt a wait-and-see policy. They believe that the next action should be initiated by the government. Some foreigners even expect that after the National Army achieves military victories, the government will follow up with some political concessions to show its spirit of compromise. The government is becoming increasingly concerned about the Communist Party's insistence on its original demands due to the approaching date of the National Assembly. The government hopes that the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and other 　 factions and non-partisan representatives can jointly participate in the National Assembly to formulate a constitution. The Communist Party currently has no intention of participating. Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan stated that the Communist Party will formally respond to the government's invitation to the Communist Party to submit a list of National Assembly representatives. The Communist Party firmly stated that it will never attend the National Assembly until the sound of gunfire in the civil war stops. It is said that before the government puts forward conditions that can be accepted by the Communist Party as a basis for negotiations, it should first occupy Zhangjiakou and Harbin, the two major final goals, to give the Communists a lesson. If this statement is true, then the government's military activities will inevitably intensify in the coming days.

### The Government's Military Achievements Have a Dual Political Effect: British Newspapers Comment on the Dynamics of Peace in China

[Report from our Correspondent in London, 25th] The successive victories of the National Army in North China have gradually attracted the attention of the British press in the past few days. The London Times published an article today entitled "The Dynamics of Peace in China," stating that the Communist Party has repeatedly suffered defeats and is 　 prepared to accept the government's peace proposals based on constitutional reform. The advent of new hope is not entirely due to the efforts of the American 　 people, but at least partly due to the result of recent military developments. The newspaper pointed out that the political effects of the government's military victory are twofold: first, the Communist Party gradually realizes that the hope of establishing an independent region against the government within China is extremely slim; second, the government, having occupied the main areas returned by Japan and withdrawn by the Communist Army, now intends to implement the agreement established in February this year. The newspaper stated: "The two major obstacles to the implementation of this agreement are the Communist Party's desire to occupy areas that were not under the Communist Party 　 when the agreement was established, and the Communist Army's attempts to destroy transportation in order to exclude government troops. Now, after fighting hard, the government has restored the position that Chairman Chiang believes is necessary to resolve the Kuomintang-Communist dispute. Maintaining the normal state of railway communication is a necessary condition for the entire construction work. The Communist Party's destructive policy is deeply resented by the government. Now that the government has exerted its power, it can shake hands with the Communist Party and let the Communist Party follow the constitutional path to achieve its goals. This hope is no longer empty." Regarding the news of the Kuomintang-Communist war, British newspapers only have fragmentary records. The British public is not clear about the actual situation in China. Today's editorial in The Times briefly describes the situation in China, and its argument is fair, unbiased, and constructive. It will undoubtedly enable the British public to better understand the current situation in China.

### The CCP Suffers a Devastating Political Failure

Deceptive Propaganda is Exposed

[Report from our Xuzhou Office, 26th] The Communist Party is now suffering a devastating political failure. Its long-touted political work has been exposed for what it is when the National Army advances. The people in various places welcome the National Army with genuine feelings. The National Army adopts a lenient policy towards those who have served the Communist Army, without retaliation. Therefore, the local teams of the Communist Army are unwilling to follow when the Communist Army retreats and are vying to reform themselves. In Xiaoxian County alone, there are as many as three thousand people, and the total number is quite considerable. The Communist Army's propaganda of "not leaving the township, not leaving the county" is no longer effective. Wang Gongyu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, who is here to supervise administrative personnel and coordinate with military affairs, told reporters today that the exposure of the Communist Party's political weaknesses is both a joy and a fear for us. The joy is that the people are no longer deceived, and the fear is how to keep the enthusiasm of the people in the recovered areas lasting for a long time, which requires the greatest effort. Wang said: "The most difficult thing now is the lack of special funds. The newly recovered areas are full of scars and in need of funds everywhere. We have already requested the central government to allocate special funds." He also said that the reformed Communist Army will be given appropriate training. Wang also said: "The people in the north are tough and there is a lot of armed force among the people, which is enough to deal with the Communist Army and is quite helpful to the National Army."

### National Army Enters Kangzhuang on the PingSui Line: A Major Battle is About to Break Out in Huailai: Order in Zhangjiakou Has Fallen into Chaos

[Report from Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The military confirmed this morning the news that the National Army had entered Kangzhuang on the PingSui Line after the Communist Army withdrew. In addition, "part of the Communist Army" in Guyuan, Chahar Province, revolted and established contact with the National Army in Rehe 　. The people in Duolun and other places launched armed uprisings in large numbers, and the Communist Army in the city was shaken.

[Report from our Beiping Office, 26th] The National Army on the border of Hebei and Chahar provinces is still in action, and a formal war does not seem to have broken out yet. However, the relevant authorities hinted to reporters that there may be important news to be released tomorrow, in which case the matter may break out tonight. The Air Force reported today that the Communist Army is building solid fortifications on the Xiahuayuan line. More than 300 Communist Army artillery pieces were found in Sangyuan 　 and are active. Senior officials estimate that the battle of Zhangjiakou can be expected to end two weeks after it breaks out. The staff of the Zhangjiakou United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Miss Bi Bi 　 Da, Mr. Walut, Mr. Silin, and Mr. Fu Qingling and Mr. Zhang Sunzhen of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, returned to Beiping by the Executive Headquarters' plane yesterday. According to them, the order in Zhangjiakou is gradually becoming chaotic. The sound of explosions can be heard at any time, all caused by the Communist Army destroying buildings.

[Report from our Beiping Office, 26th] A certain military expert said: "The fate of Zhangjiakou will be determined by the battle of Huailai. The terrain of Huailai is extremely dangerous, and after passing Huailai, there is no danger to defend until Zhangjiakou." It is said that Zhu De clearly declared at a military conference in Zhangjiakou that Huailai must be defended to the death, and no retreat is allowed without orders.

[Report from our Beiping Office, 26th] People from Zhangjiakou say that Zhangjiakou has completely lost its peace. Gunshots can be heard day and night in the suburbs. Military facilities can be seen everywhere. Most of the young people have been incorporated into the Communist Army, and women are forced to join the Women's Federation to engage in auxiliary military work. The old and young are evacuated to the countryside. Except for the necessary military factories, all other factories have completely shut down. Machinery and materials are mostly transported to Yuxian 　 and Yuanyuan. Because materials and food are being requisitioned, prices are soaring and cannot be suppressed. The Zhangjiakou power supply was originally in Xiahuayuan under Beiping Tuoluo, but the two 25,000-kilowatt generators and one 10,000-kilowatt generator in that place have been dismantled and the facilities have been bombed. Currently, there is only a small generator in Zhangjiakou city for military purposes. The four-unit high-speed rotary press used by the "Jin-Cha-Ji Daily" left behind by the Japanese has been destroyed 　 due to its weight. The newspaper stopped printing in Zhang on the 17th. Chen Jinmin, a former professor at Chaoyang University who recently joined the Communist Party, has been appointed as the chief writer of the newspaper. Currently, the train to Zhangdong runs to Huailai, and the Da 　 Bridge to the east has been destroyed twice. The train travels at night, and the farmers within 15 kilometers of the railway, those aged 15 to 50, are forced to 　 go to designated locations to gather.

### Original Owners Retain Property Rights After Land Struggle and Liquidation: Instructions Being Requested on How to Resolve the Border Currency Issue

A Statement by the Person in Charge of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters

[Report from Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] According to the person in charge of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, the principle for handling land in the newly recovered areas is that the original owners retain the property rights of land that has been subject to struggle and liquidation, but they may not immediately take it back. The current users will continue to use it as tenants, and the land tax will be shared by the landlord and the tenant. The rent paid by the tenant to the owner will only be implemented after the detailed rules for the restoration of land ownership have been approved. The Provisional Headquarters will follow this principle in all the newly recovered areas under its jurisdiction. Regarding the border currency issue, a laissez-faire attitude is being adopted for the time being. The National Army in the Jidong area uses legal currency, and the people use border currency among themselves. It has not been explicitly prohibited and there are no disputes. However, in order to reduce the burden on the people, instructions have been requested from the central government to prepare a solution.

### The Prospect of Commodity Prices is Optimistic: Economic Experts Cite Three Factors. The Trend of the US Dollar is Unlikely to Last

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 26th] An economic expert said: "There are many signs that the prospect of commodity prices is optimistic recently. In Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, the fluctuations of some commodities due to the rise of the US dollar lack a basis and it is believed that they will fall back soon." He cited three reasons for optimism: "(1) The fiscal situation this year is very good. Last year, only 15% of the national income relied on tax revenue, and the rest relied almost entirely on the issuance of banknotes. The situation has completely changed this year. Tax revenue can account for 60% of the total income. At the same time, the income from the auction of enemy property is also large, and the fiscal future is very optimistic; (2) There is a general good harvest this year, and grain prices are stable in various places, which will be of great benefit to suppressing commodity prices; (3) Transportation in various places has gradually recovered, and transportation is becoming more convenient day by day. The abnormal phenomena caused by the imbalance between supply and demand in the past are no longer serious."

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 26th] It is learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has basically decided on its policy direction for next year, focusing on the development of international trade and the protection of domestic private industries.

### Cotton Mills Purchase Cotton Domestically: The Four Banks Trust Will Provide Mortgage Financing

### Northeast Limits Cotton Exports; Wang Nianzu Discusses Commodity Adjustment Issues: Using Barter to Exchange Goods

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 25th] The issue of adjusting the inflow and outflow of commodities in the Northeast is currently receiving great attention from all parties. Yesterday, according to Deputy Director Wang Nianzu of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Northeast Xing Yuan Economic Commission, the "Provisional Measures for Adjusting the Inflow and Outflow of Commodities" had been promulgated earlier regarding the restrictions and incentives for commodity inflow and outflow. However, there have been slight changes since then, mainly concerning exports such as pig bristles and horse tails. The method of issuing permits for export had been adopted, but later, considering that there was no need to adopt a permit system for these materials in the Northeast, it has now been lifted. Export is allowed freely without restrictions. As for cotton and cottonseed, a permit system had been adopted, allowing their export. However, in recent months, the price inside the customs area has been higher than in the Northeast, and there has been a phenomenon of continuous outflow. Considering the current situation in the Northeast, cotton and cotton cloth are extremely scarce. Not only do the people feel a shortage of necessities, but also the supply of cotton raw materials for the textile factories that are about to start operation is becoming a problem. Therefore, the regulations have also been changed, and all exports are absolutely restricted. Regarding export incentives, in addition to exempting all export goods from taxes, the Central Trust Bureau has previously signed a contract with the United Kingdom to sell 10,000 tons of soybeans exported from the Northeast, which it has completed the purchase of, and may soon be transported to the UK via Huludao and Shanghai. In addition, it is planned to export soybeans to the United States, and negotiations are underway. Secondly, regarding the issue of export ports, currently, export goods must pass through Huludao and then to Shanghai before they can be exported. However, because the conditions of Huludao Port are currently insufficient and the warehouse facilities are inadequate, the government plans to convert the port into a direct export port without going through Shanghai. Therefore, it is necessary to build more warehouses. It is expected that this will be of great benefit to promoting exports in the future. In order to connect the materials between various regions of the country, so as to stabilize prices and ensure the livelihood of the people, it is planned to exchange miscellaneous grains produced in the Northeast with flour and cotton cloth produced in Shanghai and Tianjin, which is also one of the important policies recently. Also, at present, the factories in the Northeast have not officially resumed production, and the products are too few to meet the urgent needs of the people. Therefore, there is no phenomenon of foreign goods flooding the market and affecting industrial development. There is no such hidden worry for the time being. Once there is a sign of the above situation, restrictions can be imposed in accordance with the industrial and commercial remittance restriction methods. The so-called industrial and commercial remittance method is that the current import and export merchants who want to order foreign goods must have their remittances to foreign countries reviewed and approved by the Four Banks Joint Office before they can remit the money. If the government believes that the continuous import of a certain type of goods will affect the development of a certain industry in the Northeast, then the industrial and commercial remittances for purchasing that foreign goods will be restricted, and the above phenomenon can be avoided.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding the problem of supplementing electricity in the Northeast, the authorities stated that they will do their best to solve the difficulties. The current electricity is 190,000 kilowatts, which is sufficient for application. Xiaofengman sends electricity to Shenyang, which has reached 45,000 kilowatts. The current distribution situation is: Shenyang 20,000 kilowatts, Yingkou 2,000 kilowatts, Anshan 2,000 kilowatts, Jinzhou (including Fuxin) 5,000 kilowatts, Fushun 15,000 kilowatts, and Liaoyang 1,000 kilowatts.

### Transmission Line Destroyed; Shenyang Plunged into Darkness

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 25th] After Xiaofengman's power transmission arrived in Shenyang, Shenyang was gradually restored to light. However, on the night of the 24th, the entire city became a dark world again. After investigation, it was found that the Xiaofengman transmission line to Shenyang was destroyed by someone north of Fushun by blasting the battery. The Electricity Bureau is sending people to repair it. The electricity needed by Shenyang is currently maintained by 2,000 kilowatts of electricity transmitted from Xi'an.

### Reception of Northern Jiangsu Youths; Implementation of Five Training Programs

Suzhou Youth Army Hosts Reporters

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, This Newspaper, 26th] Brigadier General Gu Rongjun, commander of the Second Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Suzhou, hosted a tea party at 3 pm on the 26th to receive reporters from Shanghai and Suzhou newspapers.

### Truman Submits Report on Total Amount of UNRRA Supplies to China; Total of Over 440,000 Tons Since May

[United Press, Washington, 25th] President Truman submitted the eighth report to Congress on the work of UNRRA for the second quarter of 1946, stating that the total amount of relief supplies shipped to China in May reached 446,057 tons, and since the beginning, a total of 2,104,210 tons have been transported. The President said: "Since the beginning, the transportation plan has been one of the biggest obstacles," saying that due to the lack of transportation, food could not be transported to the famine areas behind the coastal cities, and the necessary equipment for rebuilding roads, bridges and railways was piled up on the docks. This situation has gradually improved in the past three months, and food supplies have been able to be transported to the interior of China in large quantities. The President said that the recent report from the China branch showed that "food is now being rapidly transported to disaster areas." He also said that UNRRA's medical program "has achieved considerable success in China."

### Fierce Fighting Among Lolo Tribes; Investigation Team Ventures Out; U.S. Senator Cables President Insisting on Rescuing Pilots

[United Press, Chengdu, 25th] After the discovery of missing American pilots forced into hard labor in the Lolo tribe area bordering Tibet and Burma, the U.S. military authorities are preparing to investigate the truth. However, news from the border has revealed that the Lolo tribes are engaged in fierce fighting in an area of 200 miles along the Tibetan border, threatening the investigation work. However, the search team led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Han Qiqin, disregarding everything, set off according to the scheduled plan, accompanied by French tea planter who is familiar with the situation of the Lolo tribes, aboard the military aircraft "Question Mark" from Xichang. Fights among the Lolo tribes are common, but it is reported that the recent battles are exceptionally fierce. The weapons they use are no longer the spears and leather shields of the past, but modern firearms, including automatic weapons, which the tribe stole or purchased during the war. Their equipment is also very sophisticated. According to an official here, the early search team was warned by the natives that it must enter its territory peacefully and be prepared to redeem the captives at a price, otherwise the search team would be ambushed and killed. The reason why the search team is proceeding cautiously and contacting through intermediaries is because of this. The main task of Lieutenant Colonel Han and his party is to safely rescue the captives. If force is used, it will be of no avail.

[United Press, Tacoma, Washington, 25th] After it was reported that missing American pilots were forced into hard labor in the Lolo tribe area in western China, the U.S. military authorities are trying to rescue them.

Washington State Democratic Senator Kefei expressed dissatisfaction upon hearing the news and sent a cable to President Truman, protesting, stating: "No one complains about the cost of rescue being expensive. I firmly advocate that you immediately order the dispatch of an expeditionary force from the U.S. military base in Chongqing to the Lolo area in western Sichuan, and publicly announce that rescuing all Americans enslaved in remote areas is the determination of the United States."

### Editorial: Who is Sitting Back and Watching Prices Soar?

Generally, when there is inflation, prices will inevitably rise; when prices rise, they often stimulate industry and commerce, taking advantage of the opportunity to prosper, which can achieve a temporary boom. Therefore, the high price policy itself can be said to be half beneficial and half harmful, as long as it is used properly, and at the right time, it may not be a bad method.

However, when this example is applied to our country, it seems to have gone awry. Isn't there a high price problem now? The result is:

(1) Many factories reduce work hours or close down. The entire industry in Shanghai, and even the entire country, is showing a risk of total collapse;

(2) Unemployment increases, and society is uneasy;

(3) Exports are sluggish, but foreign goods are still selling well. The trend of smuggling is rampant. Customs officers and police are almost at a loss, or may even be taking advantage of the situation;

(4) Ordinary people feel that life is difficult, and demand salary increases and improved treatment, which indirectly promotes inflation and rising prices;

(5) There is a surplus of floating capital, which has created various speculations and abnormal transactions;

(6) Legitimate industries and businesses cannot withstand the pressure of high interest rates and are eking out a meager existence under a facade.

According to this, it seems that today's high prices only show their harm, and do not show their benefits. Whether from the perspective of national economy or from the perspective of people's livelihood, there is a need to quickly suppress them. At the last meeting before the Shanghai Municipal Council adjourned, it unanimously passed an emergency motion, requesting the government authorities to quickly curb the rise in prices. This is indeed the urgent cry of the people!

But unfortunately, the facts in front of us are just the opposite. Despite the unanimous call to suppress prices and stabilize prices, the rise in prices has become even more intensified and rampant. In the past few days, it has become insanely out of control! After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the general prices in Shanghai have risen by at least 20%, usually by 30% to 40%, and even by 100% to 200%. This phenomenon undoubtedly increases the difficulty of exporting goods, expands the sales of imported goods, fuels the arrogance of smuggling, and deepens the oppression of general life. Some hope when adjusting foreign exchange before has now become a fantasy! At this time, if we continue to muddle along and do not take thorough and effective measures, social order and the national economy will inevitably suffer a serious blow. This is by no means alarmist talk, but clearly an imminent reality.

Perhaps it is said that suppressing prices is something that everyone wants, and everyone thinks alike. The difficulty lies in not having appropriate methods. This seems right, but it is not entirely true. In order for any method to have its full effect, it must first have the determination to thoroughly implement it, and it must not be mixed with other effects or calculations. Take rice as an example: since the adjustment of foreign exchange, general prices have risen, but the price of gold, until recently, was almost the same as before. The reason is very simple, is that the quantity sold is relatively large and the price of the sale does not allow a step-by-step increase.

If we talk about suppression on one hand, but race against the black market on the other hand, and only allow prices to rise but not fall: once the price is raised, it never turns back, will this method be effective in suppressing prices? Clear-headed people will naturally know.

Also, the amount of materials sold is too small, and the actual need is far from enough. Although the production is limited and cannot be fully accepted, the results of the allocation sometimes have surpluses, which are rolled into the next period. This allocation obviously makes the people in need feel apprehensive, and they grab the goods as soon as they see them, and it also allows general merchants to spot the opportunity and hoard for speculation. Does this method have a counter-stimulating effect on suppressing prices? Clear-headed people will be able to distinguish it even more.

Although it is said to crack down on unscrupulous merchants, crack down on hoarding, and crack down on speculation, we have never been able to come up with specific crackdown methods. Even if there are specific methods, we have never been willing to implement them seriously, giving them a real blow. Don't you see that materials such as yarn, cloth, and sugar are flying all over the streets in the black market every day? What effect does this method have on suppressing prices? It is not even worth mentioning.

There are also many similar controlled institutions. They themselves do not have sufficient materials to supply as much as possible, but they do not allow or restrict merchants to freely transport and sell to each other. They only control the limited materials and implement selfish monopolies, openly competing with merchants for profits. Therefore, the higher the price, the thicker their profits are. Coal is the most obvious example. But does this method not run counter to suppressing prices?

There are many reasons for rising prices, and some of them are at least due to the mismanagement of personnel, which should be thoroughly rectified and improved, directly reducing its cost, which indirectly reduces its selling price. For example, the loss of theft of goods during transportation, the unreasonable unloading fees, the pressure of high interest rates, and excessive taxes, etc., are all well-known things. If these burdens are not reduced or exempted separately, and we only talk about suppressing prices, will this method have good results in suppressing prices? It is not necessary to say more to clarify.

In short, it is not that there is no way to suppress prices, but that we have the methods but are unwilling to implement them. It is also not that we have methods but do not implement them, but that we implement them too incompletely. If there are other calculations, and we are unwilling to sacrifice, or we still want to skim some profits from high prices, exaggerating achievements, and only do some painless and perfunctory work to embellish, then it is no different from adding fuel to the fire, and at best, it can only be used to comfort ourselves!

Therefore, those who sit back and watch prices soar today and are helpless should know that they have a responsibility to the country and the people.

### Unreliability of Propaganda Offensives

Since the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have stalled, the wars in various places have been expanding day by day. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has launched all kinds of propaganda offensives to make people's heads spin. Its purpose is to make everyone believe that there is no hope of saving the situation in China. When Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department hosted foreign reporters in Beijing the day before yesterday, a foreign newspaper reporter asked, "Is there no hope for the overall situation in China?" This is because foreigners who do not understand the situation in China have been poisoned by the propaganda offensive of the Communist Party, that is why they have this question.

After Japan surrendered, the CCP made a fatal mistake. Because it occupied a favorable military position at the time, it was superstitious about the omnipotence of force, that is, it raised troops to create chaos. Today, when we recall the posture of the CCP at that time, how majestic it was! Although the government tried its best to seek peace, the key to peace or war was entirely in the hands of the CCP. Today, an agreement is signed, and tomorrow it will be completely destroyed. And the mediators sent by the Central Government and friendly countries still respect the opinions and claims of the CCP. Unexpectedly, unprincipled tolerance is tantamount to condoning the CCP's absurd actions, making the CCP's arrogance even more rampant. When the CCP is in a favorable military situation, it uses force to create chaos, fighting for cities and territories. Once it is at a disadvantage, it chants for an unconditional ceasefire, attempting to use the ceasefire time to gain a chance to breathe, so that it can prepare its troops and launch another offensive. Therefore, now the CCP is asking to convene the Three-Person Small Correction Committee, and also asking the government to guarantee a ceasefire order, etc. Almost no one dares to believe that this is the path to achieving peace. The propaganda offensive of the CCP can no longer deceive people.

Although the military development in the past three months has shattered the CCP's dream of relying on force to solve the problem, the CCP is still hovering on a wrong path, and there is no sign of a major epiphany. Suiyuan, Chairman Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to CCP leader Mao Zedong, earnestly persuading the CCP to lay down its arms, join the government, and promote constitutional government, but how the CCP reacted is still unknown. We believe that the CCP will never lay down its butcher knife until it has reached the end of its rope.

The government has decided to convene the National Assembly as scheduled on November 12, and will order the convocation on October 2. The election office has also issued notices to various parties, requesting them to submit a list of representatives before October 10. If the CCP can abandon the illusion of solving the problem by force and change to the path of political settlement, then this is an excellent opportunity. However, according to CCP spokesperson Liao Chengzhi, "The CCP has a consistent position on the National Assembly issue. Since the government does not stop the war and does not act in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, we should reserve the right to act freely and will never be bound by this kind of National Assembly." At the same time, another CCP spokesperson, Wang Bingnan, threatened the government by convening a "Liberated Area" People's Congress by the CCP. This is enough to prove that the CCP does not want real democracy, but only wants to use this beautiful name to deceive the public and divide China.

Although the CCP can in fact become the second largest party in China, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department also used this as a statement, but any political party, if it cannot think about the welfare of the people, if it cannot fight for the future of the country, how can it have a bright future? Therefore, even if the CCP is only considering its own future, it should have a major epiphany and change its propaganda offensive. "Those who commit many injustices will destroy themselves." The competition between political parties cannot escape this law either. What is the use of propaganda that specializes in psychological warfare?

### Review of Policies Supporting Defeated Nations

How to handle defeated nations? This seems to be a contentious issue among the victorious nations, particularly concerning Germany, the ringleader in Europe.

Recently, Churchill gave a speech at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, advocating for Franco-German cooperation. He believes that without a great Germany, Europe cannot be revived. Byrnes, in a speech in Berlin, expressed hope that Germany could be self-sufficient without the support of the United Nations, because if Germany cannot recover, the recovery of Europe, especially that of countries neighboring Germany, will be delayed. Germany's current position is important, and politicians around the world are paying close attention. In terms of both words and actions, the United Kingdom and the United States are working to promote its recovery. This is already a clear fact.

Germany was the ringleader in this war, and its militarism and the arrogance of its perceived racial superiority have been deeply ingrained in the hearts of its people since the time of Prussia, and were not merely the incitement of Hitler and a few Nazis. Its people are highly organized, extremely patriotic, and possess high levels of scientific knowledge. If the United Nations gives them a chance to recover, they can easily work hard and become a strong European power in a very short period of time.

The speeches by Churchill and Byrnes, and the recent economic policies of the UK and US in their occupied zones of Germany, have caused particular concern for the Soviet Union and France. The Soviet Union fears that a revived Germany will raise the banner of anti-communism and aggression against the USSR. France fears that Germany will rearm and once again sweep across Europe. These two countries, one in the east and one in the west, have the closest relationship with Germany. It is natural for them to be wary of Germany in every way, and there is nothing to be surprised about.

But why are the UK and US not afraid of Germany, but instead working to support its recovery? Firstly, because of the economic burden. To occupy Germany, the United States must spend vast sums of money, not only to support its own troops, but also to relieve the starving people. The United Kingdom already feels it does not have enough food for its own people and still maintains a rationing system to this day. However, the people in the occupied zones of Germany cannot be allowed to starve. The result is that it must borrow money from the United States to transport food for relief. The heavy burden still falls on the shoulders of the United States. The United Kingdom cannot bear it, and the United States cannot bear it even more!

Another reason is the threat from the Soviet Union. Since the end of this war, Soviet leaders have feared the United States more than they feared Nazi Germany. In particular, on February 9th of this year, Stalin personally announced that another war was inevitable, and his meaning was, of course, directed at someone. From that day on, the Soviet Union expanded its military internally, developing all industries and resources related to military affairs. Research on the atomic bomb was being pursued diligently under the direction of Beria. The production of gasoline, which the Soviet Union itself proclaimed to be the highest in the world at the 1937 Moscow International Geological Congress, has now shifted to promoting a scarcity of oil and competing with the UK and US in Iran. Externally, it is engaged in overt and covert struggles everywhere, establishing puppet governments, and provoking internal conflicts in order to expand its zone of security. Its massive military presence in Germany, Austria, and Eastern Europe has also been slow to withdraw. Supporting Yugoslavia's bid for Trieste and threatening Turkey to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait further demonstrate its ambitions. In addition, in Greece, Korea, Japan, and even India, it is in direct or indirect conflict with the UK and US everywhere. Although Marshal Stalin recently announced that "there is no danger of war at present," the Soviet Union's actual actions seem to be preparing for war.

Fear of the Soviet Union and preparation for struggle have thus aroused fear in the UK and US, and preparation for defense. But to defend against the Soviet Union, the relationship with other places is small, and the relationship with Germany is large. Germany is located in the center of the European continent, and its people are highly capable. It is a natural barrier for the West and the most appropriate buffer between the two major powers. The Soviet Union saw this point early on, so in the early days of its occupation, it did far more to win over the people than the UK, US, and France. Now the UK and US also feel the importance of Germany and are trying to win it over. The speeches by Byrnes and Churchill are expressions of appeasement toward the German people. Germany, as a defeated nation, is worthy of being appeased by several victorious nations. This shows that a country and a nation must still rely on their own efforts to make themselves successful and capable.

The most distressed party in all of this is France. On the one hand, it fears the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, it fears Germany. It is unwilling to cooperate thoroughly with the UK and US to support Germany, but it also dares not abandon its relationship with the UK and US, which would contribute to the westward expansion of Soviet power. Moreover, the Bidault government, under the leadership of de Gaulle, is gradually being opposed by the French people, and there may even be a danger of collapse.

There is a Chinese saying: "When the snipe and the clam grapple, the fisherman benefits." The fear and struggle between the Soviet Union and the UK and US are no different from the snipe and the clam grappling, and Germany is now being valued, and is reaping the benefits of the fisherman. But not only Germany, isn't Italy also receiving support from the US in the peace conference? Isn't General MacArthur also using all his strength to revive Japan? Even MacArthur's advisors are scolding our country's authorities for the sake of Japan's silk industry? Even the remnants of fascism, Franco in Spain, are safely maintaining their power. If things continue like this, it is uncertain whether one day the defeated nations will raise their heads and engage in aggression again!

We seriously doubt the wisdom of the current policy of the UK and US to support the instigators of war. We doubt even more the wisdom of the Soviet Union's inability to cooperate, which has led to the UK and US adopting this policy of supporting the ringleaders. Today, the key to world peace lies in the cooperation of the five great powers, especially in the sincere cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union. If they do not cooperate, the world situation will only get worse. It will not be difficult for Germany, Italy, and Japan to reorganize their forces. The Soviet Union has many enemies and will be even more difficult to deal with. Will the United States' use of these aggressive nations in the future repeat the mistakes of the pre-war British "balance of power" policy, leading to an uncontrollable situation? For the sake of the self-interests of the US and the Soviet Union, and for the sake of world peace, it is still better to be candid and cooperate, and to promote the full cooperation of the world's five powers, and even strengthen the UN's capabilities and prestige, in order to maintain world peace and prevent aggressive nations from being revived, and humanity from suffering another unprecedented catastrophe.

This method is currently being negotiated and carried out at any time. The section in your newspaper that this office's grain was requisitioned by the Ministry of Food is not true, and there was no such statement at the time. Accordingly, we request that you investigate and correct it. UNRRA.

### Seize the Opportunity to Mend the Rift: UK and US Hope for Consistency Between Words and Actions from the Soviet Union; British Cabinet Meeting Discusses Foreign Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Authoritative figures in the UK and US stated today that unless the Soviet Union is consistent between its words and actions, Stalin's recently released statements of conciliation will not have any significant impact on the diplomatic conflict between the Eastern and Western blocs. US Secretary of State Byrnes shows no sign of considering changing his current firm policy. The US side is convinced that unless the Soviet Union takes some conciliatory action in the peace conference or the upcoming Four Power Conference, Byrnes will not be moved by Stalin's statements about cooperation with Western democracies. Regarding the point that neither side wants war, the UK and US are in complete agreement with Stalin's view. The concern is that one side may misunderstand the situation and allow some incidents to escalate into war.

[Our Report] London dispatch, 26th: Marshal Montgomery went to Downing Street today to attend a cabinet meeting. The Prime Minister's residence was crowded with tourists. Prime Minister Bevin also participated in the meeting. It is believed that the discussion included many issues related to foreign policy, and Stalin's statement was very likely to be brought up for discussion first.

[Associated Press, Stratford, UK, 25th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden stated in his constituency today that Marshal Stalin's remarks offer a new opportunity for the country's foreign policy, which we all welcome. He firmly believes that the Soviet Union and the Western diplomatic community will seize this opportunity. Although there are many difficulties ahead, they can be overcome if they are persistent and sincere.

### London Evening Standard Reports: Truman and Stalin May Meet

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The London Evening Standard's New York correspondent, Webbley, recently telegraphed that President Truman's advisors are currently trying to arrange a meeting between President Truman and Marshal Stalin, so that the rift between the Soviet Union and Western democracies can be mended. Since the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union and Western democracies have parted ways. President's advisors generally believe that the conversation between Marshal Stalin and Walter, a reporter from the Times of London stationed in Moscow, sufficiently demonstrates that the time for a meeting between President Truman and Marshal Stalin is ripe and can strengthen the position of the Democratic Party in the country. Since the former Secretary of Commerce Wallace was ordered to resign, the position of the Democratic Party has been greatly weakened. President Truman himself also believes that it is meaningless for the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference to meet frequently, and it should be replaced by a Three Great Powers Conference to discuss various long-standing issues.

### Paris Peace Conference Concludes, Plenary Session Held Yesterday; Disagreement on Approval of Treaty with Finland; US and Soviet Union Argue over Romanian Reparations Issue

[Our Report] Paris dispatch, 26th: The Paris Peace Conference suddenly advanced its plenary session to 5:30 PM today. This move is largely related to the lack of consensus on the approval of the treaty with Finland.

[Our Report] Paris dispatch, 26th: Due to Stalin's recent conciliatory remarks, representatives from various countries at the peace conference are waiting quietly for signs of a compromise attitude from the Soviet representatives on the Trieste dispute. However, today the Soviet representative Vyshinsky again launched a major attack on the United States, accusing the United States of deliberately obstructing the resolution of various economic issues in the Balkans, especially the reparations issue in Romania.

[Our Report] Paris dispatch, 26th: Vyshinsky reviewed the Romanian reparations issue in the Balkan Committee today, emphasizing the importance of Romania's participation in the Allied war effort in 1944. He reiterated the Soviet Union's position on this issue, saying that the reparations we are asking Romania to pay are only one-fifth of the total losses caused by the Romanian army's destruction and looting in southwestern Soviet territory. We believe that the Allied demands for full reparations are unfair. Vyshinsky said that Romania is scarred by war, mostly due to Allied bombing, so Romania cannot bear full responsibility, nor can it fully bear the consequences. For this reason, the Soviet delegation believes that full reparations are far from just and equitable. This issue was not resolved today and has been decided to be discussed again at a later date.

### Little Progress in the Work of Various Committees

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The decision made by the Four Power Foreign Ministers yesterday to take measures to accelerate the work of the peace conference has not had any effect in the various committees of the peace conference. The Committee on Economic Issues with Italy, the Committee on Political and Territorial Issues with Italy, and the Trieste Subcommittee have all met for a long time, but have produced little result. The meeting situation of the various committees is as follows:

Regarding the Issue of Property Compensation in Italy

(1) The Committee on Economic Issues with Italy met this afternoon to discuss the issue of whether all or part of the property owned by citizens of the Allied countries in Italy should be compensated by Italy. After debate, a vote was taken, and nine votes were in favor of partial compensation, and nine votes were in favor of full compensation. The committee then discussed the amendment proposed by the Yugoslav representative, advocating the adoption of a percentage-based compensation method. This principle was ultimately rejected by the committee with fourteen votes. The committee finally passed the French delegation's proposal, deciding that the compensation amount would be 75 percent. At this point, the Soviet representative stood up and spoke, demanding that the French delegation's proposal must be passed by a two-thirds majority. However, the committee adjourned without discussion.

Deadline for Withdrawal of Allied Forces from Hungary

(2) The Committee on Political and Territorial Issues with Italy made very slow progress today, discussing the clause in the treaty with Hungary stipulating that all Allied forces should withdraw within ninety days after the signing of the treaty. Later, the representatives of Australia and Czechoslovakia voluntarily withdrew their amendments, and the committee then passed it. Regarding the suggestion proposed by the UK and US that disputes arising from the implementation of the treaty should be resolved by the International Court of Justice, it was passed only after lengthy discussion. The Soviet Union's proposed amendment, advocating direct negotiations in such circumstances, was rejected by the committee. In addition, the committee also passed Article 34 of the treaty with Hungary, stipulating that within eighteen months after the signing of the treaty, the heads of the diplomatic missions of the UK, US, and Soviet Union will represent the Allied countries in handling all issues related to the implementation of the treaty. (3) The Trieste Issue Subcommittee made no progress again today, and it is almost certain that it will not be able to complete its work in the short term.

### Soviet Union Originally Intended to Join the Tripartite Pact, Revealed in Evidence Submitted to the International Court of Justice

Stalin Told Matsuoka that He Would Not Be Friendly with Britain

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th] According to evidence presented during the war crimes trials today, the Soviet Union originally intended to join the Tripartite Pact, but the plan fell through because Germany could not meet Stalin's conditions. This was revealed in the records of the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the late Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka in Berlin on March 28, 1941. The document proves that Ribbentrop secretly told Matsuoka that after the breakdown of German-Soviet negotiations, Germany could deal with the Soviet Union slowly, but Ribbentrop pointed out that Hitler was quite unhappy with Stalin's attitude, and if Stalin did anything to offend him again, he was determined to "destroy the Soviet Union."

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th] According to evidence presented during the war crimes trials today, in the spring of 1940, Stalin told the then Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka that the Soviet Union had never been friendly with Britain in the past, and would not be friendly with Britain in the future. Matsuoka, before his death in June, was one of the defendants awaiting trial. When he discussed with Hitler on March 27, 1941, the plan for Japan to attack Singapore as part of Japan's assistance to Germany, he immediately reported Stalin's views to Hitler.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th] The Far East International Tribunal today read the memorandum of former German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, which recorded Ribbentrop's meeting with the then Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Hiroshi Oshima, on February 23, 1941, informing him of Germany's war plan, which briefly stated: Germany has won militarily, politically, and economically, but wants to end the war quickly. If Singapore is occupied in a blitzkrieg, it will force Britain to sue for peace. Oshima assured him of the preparation for the occupation of Singapore, and said that Japan had difficulty supplying steel, so it would not build 45,000-ton battleships, but would convert submarines, torpedo boats, and speedboats to defend its homeland. Singapore must be attacked by land, as a naval offensive would be more difficult. Oshima also mentioned plans to attack Hong Kong and the Philippines, but Ribbentrop urged him to put this plan aside, saying that it was enough to attack Singapore, and that the United States had not yet armed itself and did not dare to send its "iron catfish" west of Hawaii.

### Japanese War Criminals About to Be Executed, Life Insurance Companies Worried

Compensation Issues Being Studied

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese newspapers raised an issue today, namely, after the Tokyo Tribunal sentences Japanese war criminals to death, should Japanese insurance companies compensate their families with insurance benefits, because some of the major war criminals have life insurance policies. Insurance companies will study this issue separately. However, the assets of each war criminal are currently under the custody of the Special Industry Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, so if the company compensates, it will pay it to the bureau for safekeeping instead of directly paying it to their families.

### Italian Government Agrees to Renounce Privileges in China to Rebuild Sino-Italian Relations

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 25th] The Italian Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué today stating: "The Committee on Political and Territorial Issues with Italy of the Paris Peace Conference met on the 24th of this month and passed Articles 18, 19, and 20 of the draft peace treaty with Italy, namely the three articles concerning Italy's renunciation of extraterritorial rights and concessions in China. Since Italy was forced by circumstances to not be able to directly discuss this issue with China, the Italian government has repeatedly informed the Chinese government of its readiness to renounce all privileges and interests stipulated in the 1901 Treaty of Peking and its appendices. Therefore, Italy is happy to accept the provision in the treaty to renounce this privilege, so as to conform to the policy of the current Italian government to rebuild Sino-Italian friendship."

### Unrest in Greece, British Troops Will Not Withdraw for the Time Being, Greek Prime Minister Accuses Foreign Countries of Promoting Internal Disorder

[Our Report] San Francisco dispatch, 26th: British government officials revealed today that the existence of a state of civil war in Greece makes the withdrawal of British troops impossible.

[Associated Press, Athens, 25th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris hosted foreign reporters today and issued a written statement accusing foreign forces of disrupting Greece. It briefly stated: It is clear that the war has shifted from abroad to Greece in order to achieve its goal of taking advantage of the chaotic situation to obtain an outlet to the Aegean Sea. Foreign forces have used their veto power in the UN Security Council to prevent the organization of an international fact-finding mission to inspect the Greek border. At the same time, a spokesman for the Greek Embassy in London also stated that the fierce fighting in the mountainous areas of northern Greece was caused by saboteurs who had infiltrated from Albania and Yugoslavia, with the tacit consent of the governments of those countries. Tsaldaris said in a speech to the public in Thessaloniki that the disturbances in northern Greece are actually a war against the country, and the government will resist at any cost.

[Reuters, London, 25th] The activities of guerrillas in northern Greece have greatly increased in the past week. The Greek government has not yet asked the British troops stationed in Greece to help suppress them, and the Greek government is confident that its own troops are sufficient to deal with the situation. However, according to reliable sources, the Greek government has considered referring the footholds of Albania and Yugoslavia, which are assisting the Greek left-wing guerrillas, to the UN Security Council.

### Greek King to Return Home, Prime Minister to Resign Soon

[Our Report] London dispatch, 26th: After five years in exile, Greek King George V will return home this coming week. Athens will be completely closed on that day, and all permits to carry firearms will be temporarily suspended to prevent accidents.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 26th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris announced that as soon as King George returns home and is restored to his throne, he will resign immediately. According to well-informed sources, Tsaldaris may be invited to form an expanded new cabinet. The new government seems likely to take office on the 2nd of next month, so that Tsaldaris can go to Paris to serve as the head of the Greek delegation to the peace conference again.

### Eisenhower Speaks: Small Number of US Troops Remaining in China Not Enough to Threaten Peace

[Associated Press, RMS Queen Mary, 25th] US Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower hosted reporters on the RMS Queen Mary today. Someone asked about Stalin's statement that US troops should withdraw from China quickly. He replied that only small units of US troops remained stationed in China, and it was at the request of the Chinese government. Eisenhower said that there were some Marines stationed in China, but they were now withdrawing to the coast. He also said that the US Army and Marines stationed in China were few in number and not enough to be seen as a hostile military formation. When asked about Stalin's statement that atomic bombs are only the most destructive weapons in the history of the nervous war, he said that in addition to the immediate effects, there would be more serious consequences.

### Bidault Clarifies French Policy Towards Germany

[Our Report] Paris dispatch, 26th: Bidault gave a speech at a banquet held by the local American Chamber of Commerce, clarifying his views on peace and the German issue. Bidault said, "We do not want to establish retaliatory peace against Germany. Our purpose is justice and security." He reiterated his opinion that some people condemn France for adopting a policy of compromise, which is a misunderstanding of our will. Please do not think that France's fate is something that can be gambled with.

### Iranian Government Sends Delegation to Negotiate Directly with Rebel Party; Fierce Street Fighting Breaks Out in Bushehr City

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 26th - Tehran Radio Broadcast: Iranian radio announced that Prince Firooz led a delegation that departed from Tehran today for Shiraz to begin negotiations with Nazir Qashqai, the leader of the rebel party. Firooz also revealed that Nazir plans to seize the city of Isfahan, which lies between Bushehr and Tehran. The purpose of this direct negotiation is to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, but if he ignores this lesson, he will surely experience the taste of the people's iron fist.

[Another Report] A telegram from Bushehr City in the Persian Gulf states that government forces and local troops have engaged in street fighting in the city, with control of some locations changing hands several times. The situation is extremely fierce. In London, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated that British interests in southern Iran have not been affected by the unrest. The British government currently has no intention of dispatching British troops stationed in Basra, Iraq, to assist Iran in restoring law and order.

### Future New Weapon: Leaping Tank

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] The U.S. Army is currently testing a rocket-propelled "leaping tank," which can cross trenches on the battlefield. Currently, this type of tank can leap 150 yards, but the vehicle still flips over upon landing. This aspect can be improved in the future.

### Heroin Production Reported Less Than Actual Amount, Day After Day

Eight-Year Production Totals Six Million Kilograms

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Allied Headquarters reviewed the Japanese government's files and discovered that the records submitted by Japan to the League of Nations regarding the manufacture of heroin from 1931 to 1939 were false. The quantity of heroin manufactured in those eight years was far greater than what was reported to the League of Nations. Japan reported a total production of 1,033 kilograms to the League of Nations, whereas its actual production was 6,114,137 kilograms.

### Eruption of Mount Sakurajima in Japan

Detained Europeans Begin Repatriation

However, although a ceasefire agreement has not been reached, the work of repatriating detained Europeans has already begun. One thousand people will arrive in Batavia tomorrow by train.

### Overseas Chinese Returning to the Philippines After Expiration of Permits

Philippine Authorities Intend to Deport Them; Our Consul General Makes Representations

[Associated Press, Manila, 25th] Five hundred overseas Chinese in the Philippines returned to their home country in the autumn of 1941 to visit relatives and obtained permits to return to the Philippines at that time. Unexpectedly, the Pacific War broke out shortly after their return, and these people were stranded in their ancestral homeland until the beginning of this month, when they returned to Manila from Xiamen. However, the Philippine authorities, arguing that the validity period indicated on their permits had expired, refused to allow them to stay, detained them, and intended to deport them. The Chinese Consul General in Manila, Duan Maolan, protested, stating that the overseas Chinese returned to the Philippines after the expiration of their permits due to an irresistible event. The Philippine authorities' attempt to deport them based on such a minor technicality is unjustified. President Roxas has referred the matter to the Cabinet and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for discussion.

### Japanese Nationalist Party Established

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese Nationalist Party held its founding ceremony today and issued a declaration, vaguely stating that its policy is the New People's Principles, reiterating humanitarianism based on the practice of human love, and aiming to establish a democratic country.

### Comparison of the Paris Peace Conferences of 1919 and 1946

— Lu Yu

Introduction

The Paris Peace Conference, which opened in the Luxembourg Palace on July 29 of this year, is an important milestone on Europe's path from war to peace. Such an important event deserves commentary and reporting, and articles on the peace conference are widely published in Chinese and Western newspapers and magazines. However, most of these articles describe the proceedings of the conference or predict its success or failure. Few people have discussed in detail the similarities and differences between this conference and the conference held in the Palace of Versailles twenty-six years ago. However, the importance of this issue is no less than the review of the conference itself, as everyone knows. Only by understanding the successes and failures of the previous conference and their causes can we today promote the success of this conference on the one hand and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past on the other. Only by comparing the differences between the two conferences can we improve the content of this conference and predict its future. The writing of this article is based on this purpose. In short, the purpose of this article is to attempt to identify the shortcomings of this conference compared to the previous conference through a comparison of the two conferences, and to provide improvement strategies to benefit the stability of the European situation and the establishment of world peace. The similarities and differences between the two conferences are compared from the following five aspects: (1) the international situation, (2) the tasks of the conference, (3) the powers of the conference, (4) the organizational structure, and (5) the participants!

(1) Differences in the Situation

The opening of the peace conference after World War I (January 18, 1919) was less than two months after the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne (November 11, 1918), but the convening of this conference was more than a year after the surrender of Germany (May 8, 1945). The longer the time from the end of the war to the convening of the peace conference, the more difficult the future of peace will be, because not only will the cooperative enthusiasm of the wartime allies gradually disappear with the passage of time, but also the disputes and conflicts between the great powers will be endless due to the successive occurrence of various thorny issues. This is why the background of this conference is more complex than that of the previous conference. However, the main reason for the current intensification of the international situation lies in the opposition between the two major blocs, East (Soviet Union) and West (United States, Britain), in the conference. Precisely because of the tension in the relationship between the East and West blocs, the convening of the conference has been delayed until now. Precisely because the conference is late in coming, the international situation has become even more deteriorated. This point was not present in the previous conference and is the biggest factor causing the bleak future of this conference. In the previous conference, although there was opposition between the idealistic U.S. President Wilson and the French Prime Minister Clemenceau, who insisted on a realistic policy, the conflict of opinions between them did not affect the smooth completion of the conference. On the one hand, it relied on the mediation of British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and at that time, Britain still occupied a pivotal position. On the other hand, at that time, the strength of the United States was unmatched by other countries in the world, and people all over the world regarded U.S. President Wilson as the savior from the New World. Therefore, even the roaring and stubborn Tiger Prime Minister Clemenceau had to give way to the United States and the U.S. President. However, the situation today is different. The United States and the Soviet Union are opposed to each other, and Britain's national power has been weakened. Everything is looking to the United States, and it has lost the ability and position to mediate, this is the first point. The United States and the Soviet Union both consider themselves to be the strongest countries in the world, and neither fears the other. Moreover, U.S. President Truman only took office on the eve of the end of the war. His courage, talent, and prestige are not comparable to those of the late President Roosevelt, who was a man of great talent. The Soviet Union's giant Stalin would not and would not make special concessions to the United States, this is the second point.

(2) Differences in Tasks

On this point, the two Paris Peace Conferences also have significant differences. The goal of the 1919 conference was to discuss and sign a treaty with Germany—the main enemy—namely, the Treaty of Versailles (signed on June 28, 1919). Therefore, the scope of its work was limited to the treaty with Germany. As for the treaties with the other four major enemy countries—Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey—they were not signed separately with the relevant countries until after the closure of the Paris Peace Conference. Therefore, the task of the previous conference can be summarized by the four characters "heavy first, light later," that is, first solve the important and difficult problems, and then solve the secondary and easy problems. Today's conference is just the opposite. Originally, in this war, the main enemies of the United Nations were Germany in Europe and Japan in Asia. This conference is limited to Europe, and even within Europe, it only discusses the treaties with the secondary five enemy countries—Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. The main enemy country, Germany, is not included and will be discussed at a separate conference at a later date. Therefore, the task of this conference can be called "avoiding the heavy and taking the light," that is, avoiding the difficult problem (Germany) and only seeking compromises on the secondary difficult problems (Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland). Precisely because the previous conference was not afraid of difficulties and first dealt with the main difficulties, once solved, everything else was solved. Therefore, the conference was able to achieve results in a short period of time. Precisely because this conference lacks courage and avoids discussing thorny issues, dragging everything out, for a month the Paris Peace Conference has only seen disputes and few agreements. This is another point where this conference is inferior to the previous conference.

(3) Differences in Powers

The previous conference had full power over the task it was responsible for, namely, discussing and signing a treaty with Germany. In other words, the Paris Peace Conference held in the Palace of Versailles was the highest authority at that time, and there was no other institution above it. This conference is different. Its power is limited to discussing the draft treaties (including the agreed-upon clauses and the unresolved matters) for the five countries of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, which were submitted by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, and may provide amendment opinions. Although according to the resolution of the Rules Committee of the Conference, the foreign ministers of the Four Powers should give serious consideration to and adopt the above-mentioned amendment opinions when finally drafting the treaties, this provision does not have the nature of law, and everything is still decided by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. Therefore, the current Paris Peace Conference, which is meeting in the magnificent Luxembourg Palace, is only a consultative body to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. It has no full power to discuss treaties, nor can it establish binding resolutions. It is appropriate for Australian representative Evatt to complain loudly, "The Paris Peace Conference should not only be consultative in nature, but should give all countries genuine and effective participation, so the drafting of treaties should belong to all countries, not just the three or four powers." Precisely because the previous conference had full powers, it had high prestige and great efficiency. Although the treaties it established were not without debatable points, it was able to solve a major problem in half a year (from the opening of the peace conference on January 18, 1919, to the signing of the treaty on June 28 of the same year). It is worthy of praise in stabilizing the world situation. Looking back at this conference, its powers are limited, and its nature is consultative. Therefore, the countries of the world do not pay much attention to it. Therefore, it is really difficult to expect it to exert great power and live up to the enthusiasm of the people of the world!

### Heavy Rain and Storms Strike; Raging Tides Rush Ashore, Roads Become Swamps; Collapse of Wall on Huayu Road Injures Three; Import and Export Merchants and Ships All Blocked

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning, the forward edge of a strong Pacific typhoon swept through the city, with winds reaching a magnitude of five. According to the observatory, the typhoon has already made landfall in the northwest of Fuzhou and is sweeping towards the border between Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. Therefore, the city is no longer in danger of being hit. Although it rained heavily all day yesterday, it is expected to clear up from this afternoon. Also, at 3:15 a.m. yesterday morning, a section of wall in front of No. 1 Huaxing Road suddenly collapsed due to the wind, injuring three people, Xi Zuling, Shen Xiaolong, and Luo Gen, who were crushed by the wall. They were rushed to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment.

Shanghai Meteorological Observatory Report: Siberian anticyclone in North and Central China, Pacific air mass in Japan, Korea, East China Sea, and Ryukyu Islands. After the typhoon made landfall, a low-pressure area formed in Fujian and Zhejiang, pushing north to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Its central location at 2:00 p.m. today (26th) was at 28 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude, moving north. "Weather forecast": Yellow Sea, cloudy, hazy, localized fog, light to moderate easterly winds, large waves. Central China, cloudy, showers, or rain, moderate to light northeasterly to southeasterly winds. Shanghai, cloudy, showers, or rain, gradually improving, moderate easterly winds, occasional showers. East China Sea, southern cloudy, showers, light to strong easterly to southerly winds, large waves, turbulent sea lanes around Taiwan. "Temperature on the 26th": highest 80.6 degrees, lowest 70.9 degrees. (Another report) Yesterday, the tide level reached 13.9 feet, which is rare. Coupled with heavy rain, low-lying roads became flooded again. The new floodgate built in the former Public Concession in the central district has been completed. The high tide around the Mid-Autumn Festival occurred on a clear day, and the floodgate blocked the tide, preventing it from flowing back and overflowing the road surface. Yesterday's tide was higher than the low-lying road surface. Although the floodgate automatically closed tightly, rainwater on the road could not be discharged. All pumping stations were fully operational to pump water, but they still had to wait for the tide to recede before the floodgate automatically opened to discharge the water. As for the former French Concession and the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas, floodgates are being planned and implemented. Therefore, even if the high tide occurs on a clear day, low-lying roads are also flooded by the backflow of the tide. The flooding situation yesterday was even more severe. By 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the water on all roads had gradually receded with the tide.

This hurricane caused significant impact to shipping routes along the coast. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships Hai De, Hai Su, and Hai Zhou, Taikoo's Nanchang, and Ewo's Yong Sheng, all of which were supposed to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, had not yet entered the port as of yesterday. It is said that the Nanchang is in Shantou, and the Yong Sheng is still in Hong Kong. The Hai Qian is also sheltering from the wind in Dagu. On the export side, Jardine Matheson's Zhazha Lianjia, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 25th to return south, was also blocked by the hurricane. If the wind subsides today, it will be able to export. The American President Lines' Whistler and Capital Victory, both originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, have also not set sail.

### Fuzhou Residents Sleepless All Night; More Than 200 Ships Capsized

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 26th] The violent hurricane that struck Wenzhou in the northwest via the northern sea of Taiwan, starting at 2:00 a.m. on the 25th, suddenly turned north-northeast at 11:00 p.m., with the center of its power directly facing Fuzhou in Fujian Province. Throughout the day, there were storms and rain, and houses shook, which was unseen in ten years. It became even more violent after 0:00 a.m. on the 26th, and no one in the city could sleep. The wind speed reached 25 kilometers per second, and the wind force exceeded level 10. After 7:00 a.m., the wind direction turned south-southeast, and the wind force began to weaken. The rain also gradually stopped. The streets were full of fallen trees. More than 200 large and small ships capsized in the Min River. More than ten houses collapsed in the city, and more than ten people were killed or injured. The rainfall within 24 hours was 60 millimeters.

### On a Stormy Night, the Yuying Warehouse Suffers Robbery; Losses Totaling Hundreds of Millions; Gang of Thieves Sails Across the River to Rob

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Yuying Company warehouse at No. 212 Jichang Street in Nanshi, located near the Huangpu River, is jointly organized by various factories and is filled with a large amount of American goods, such as car tires, safes, electric stoves, radios, glass raincoats, glass shoes, pigments, and various other American goods. These goods were stored more than six months ago and have not yet been sold. Recently, another batch arrived a week ago, so the goods in the warehouse were piled up like mountains, attracting the attention of thieves.

Around 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning, more than twenty thieves suddenly arrived in three sailboats, landed, and managed to open the gate of the Yuying Company warehouse and entered one after another. A thief leader held a pistol, and the others held axes, iron bars, and ropes. They first tied up the four watchmen with hemp ropes, covered them with quilts, and prevented them from making any noise. Then, they used axes to cut through the wooden fences of the warehouse. Except for heavy machinery and safes that could not be carried away, other light goods, such as radios, glass raincoats, pigments, lipsticks, and sundries, dozens of bundles in total, were repeatedly carried down to the boats by the thieves. The robbery lasted more than two hours. At that time, it was raining heavily, and no one noticed. The thieves looted and escaped. Afterwards, the watchmen struggled to break free, reported to the warehouse director Du Bingqing, and jointly reported to the Penglai Police Station. Director Yao of the branch office, after receiving the report, ordered his officers to rush to investigate and telegraphed the Water Police Station and the Port Police Station to assist in the pursuit. The losses this time cannot be accurately estimated at once, but are generally in the tens of millions of yuan or more.

### Chairman of Guangxi Province Huang Xuchu Discusses Post-War Rehabilitation Situation

Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, recently returned to Guangxi from Lushan. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing to visit President Song and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Guangxi by plane on the 29th. Mr. Huang met with reporters yesterday afternoon and spoke freely about the post-war rehabilitation situation in Guangxi and the work of rebuilding Guangxi. Chairman Huang first stated that during the Anti-Japanese War, most of Guangxi's territory was a battlefield and suffered greatly. Seventy-five of the more than one hundred counties were successively occupied by the enemy, and both urban and rural areas were severely damaged. After the war, people's livelihoods were extremely difficult, and everything needed to be restored urgently. This time, he came to Shanghai to discuss the overall financial situation of Guangxi with President Song and to seek President Song's instructions. At present, the most serious problems in Guangxi are economic panic and rural poverty. After the war, all the farming tools and cattle were looted and killed by the Japanese, making it impossible to carry out large-scale farming. In addition, this year's autumn harvest was poor, creating a major economic crisis. A large number of farmers have fled to cities to make a living, and efforts are being made to remedy this undesirable phenomenon.

### Opposing the Increase in Entertainment Tax; Theatrical Circles Petition Repeatedly

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Municipal Council resolved to increase the city's entertainment tax to 50%, the theatrical community has been extremely anxious because they cannot bear the burden. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, representatives of the city's cinema industry association went to the Municipal Council to petition. Speaker Pan personally received them and earnestly advised them that the increase in entertainment tax was purely to balance the city's budget revenue and expenditure and was based on the provisions of central government laws and regulations. If there are any special suggestions or opinions, they can be stated in writing and left for the council to discuss again.

[Another Report] The city's theatrical industry association convened a meeting of industry representatives at the Datian Stage at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, believing that the 50% entertainment tax is really difficult to bear given the current serious crisis facing the theatrical industry. Therefore, it was decided to petition the Municipal Council again.

### Enemy and Puppet Warehouse Materials Can Be Cleared Out in October

The congestion in the city's wharf warehouses affects the entire import and export business.

According to reports, the former enemy and puppet warehouses in the city that currently store enemy and puppet materials include: one along the river in Yangshupu, one at Huishan Wharf, three at Huangpu Wharf; in the urban area, three at Maigen Road Mitsui Yoko, four at Suzhou Road Lihe Yoko, twenty at East Broadway Road and Lan Road, one at Hongkou Xiangyanqiao Road, and one at Harbin Road.

### Unauthorized Pricing; Returning Farmland; Investigation Team Believes the Land Administration Bureau Exceeded Its Authority

[Our Newspaper's Report] Currently, in the City Council, the investigation team has also paid attention to the point of questioning the high-ranking officials of the Land Administration Bureau for returning the Gaohua farmland with corruption. According to detailed investigation, it was learned that the Land Administration Bureau exceeded its authority in handling enemy property. The Shanghai Experimental Economic Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry received enemy and puppet materials, but there was no inventory regarding the Zhonghua and Dafeng farms in Gaohua. These two farms occupy a total area of more than 4,000 mu and were established by the enemy's Hengchan Co., Ltd. by purchasing land from the people, which was cultivated by local people. After the victory, the Japanese fled. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry ordered Jiang Hongwei, the manager of Zhonghua Agricultural Products, to organize a rent collection office together with the appointed personnel. Later, because the income could not cover the expenses, and Jiang Hongwei could not specify the location of the Zhonghua Dafeng farm one by one, the rent collection office was revoked and incorporated into the Jungong Road branch. The two farms should have been handled by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau. Since they have not been handled, they should be kept by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. However, the Land Administration Bureau arbitrarily agreed to the local people's request and returned the land at its own price. The Handling Bureau believes that this is inappropriate. In addition, the money obtained from the sale should be remitted to the Qing Suan Office.

### Vice Admiral Power's Busy Social Engagements: Mayor Wu to Host Reception Today

### Legal Perspectives on Horse Racing: Lottery Issuance in Our Country Always Adopts a Concession System; If Approved by the Government, It Is Not a Gambling Activity

[Our Own Report] The horse racing issue, which has drawn citywide attention, remains unresolved after heated discussions at the City Council the day before yesterday. Whether selling lottery tickets in conjunction with horse racing constitutes gambling is still awaiting clarification from the central government. Yesterday, a reporter specially visited Lawyer Jiang Ping, who first proposed asking the central government for clarification during the general assembly, to inquire about how our country's laws regulate this matter. According to the discussion: those who support and those who oppose the resumption of horse racing each have substantial reasons. Horse racing itself is certainly not gambling, but issuing lottery tickets because of horse racing is completely the same in nature as gambling. However, whether it is punished as gambling under the law is quite different. According to various countries around the world, the issuance of lottery tickets is either prohibited, allowed, or subject to a concession system. Our country's law adopts a concession system. According to Article 269 of the Gambling Section of the Criminal Law: Anyone who issues lottery tickets without government approval shall be punished for gambling. From this inference: if lottery tickets are issued with government approval, it is not a gambling activity. Therefore, regarding the issue of horse racing issuing lottery tickets, it must be requested from the central government before a solution can be reached. Otherwise, even if the City Council passes a resolution considering it not gambling, without the central government's approval and concession, directly resuming horse racing and issuing lottery tickets should still be considered gambling in law.

### Views of Legal Professionals in Nanjing

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 26th] A certain counselor from the Judicial Yuan said: When the "Is Horse Racing Gambling?" case raised by the Shanghai City Council is submitted to the central government for interpretation in the future, he believes it is very likely to be considered "horse racing is a gambling activity." It is claimed that although there are no precedents to review regarding this matter, according to the Criminal Law, horse racing with betting behavior will certainly constitute a gambling crime, because Article 266 of Chapter 21 of the Criminal Law stipulates that "Anyone who gambles for money in public places or places accessible to the public shall be fined up to one thousand yuan." If horse racing resumes in Shanghai and involves selling champagne, etc., it is the same as the above article. He also pointed out the difference between horse racing and boxing and circus performances, because boxing and circus are only sports or entertainment in nature. If there is no betting behavior, even performing in "places accessible to the public" cannot be considered a gambling activity, and it cannot be prohibited. When a reporter asked about a Shanghai councilor's statement: "In the past, the government held prize-bearing savings bonds, doesn't that also have gambling significance?" the reply was: "Article 269 of the Criminal Law stipulates that anyone who intends to profit by running prize-bearing savings or issues lottery tickets without government approval shall be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for not more than one year." Prize-bearing savings bonds that have been approved by the government in advance are not subject to this article. Finally, he concluded that: The reason why Shanghai allowed horse racing in the past was entirely because Shanghai was a foreign concession with special circumstances. Now that the concession has been recovered, this kind of abnormal situation cannot be allowed, and it cannot be forced to recognize horse racing as a legitimate activity just because foreign countries allow horse racing.

### Not Yet Detrimental to the Country or the People: Wei Shanfu, Director of the Pseudo-City Chamber of Commerce, Acquitted; Li Kaichen and Zhang Yinghui to Be Sentenced on October 3

[Our Own Report] The High Court announced three cases yesterday: (1) Zhu Changsheng, the pseudo-Baolzhang of Ziteng Township in Minhang Town, relied on his power to poison the villagers and was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. (2) E Tuo Bolang, a military commentator for the German Embassy's XGRS radio station, was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for making distorted propaganda for the enemy and collecting intelligence. (3) Wei Shanfu, who once served as a director of the pseudo-Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, was declared not guilty because his actions were not detrimental to the country or the people.

On the same day, the trials of Li Kaichen, the former director of the pseudo-Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Zeng were concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for October 3.

Personal Secretary of Pan Da

Further investigations into multiple cases: (1) Shen Liang, from Wu County, 40 years old, was accused of serving as a section member of the Huxi Special Police Bureau and as the personal secretary of Pan Da, the director of the bureau, and also as a special policeman. He colluded with the 76th Division to carry out the Qingxiang Movement. Shen testified in court yesterday: He had served as a special policeman of the Municipal Council. After resigning, he was introduced by an Englishman named Kelaisuo to serve as a special policeman in Huxi. Later, he suddenly changed to an office clerk, so he did not take the position. In order to avoid the trouble of being on guard duty in the Self-Defense Corps, the household registration form still listed him as a special policeman.

Forced Concentration of British Nationals

(2) Ka Tusi, an Indian, originally served as a patrolman during the Shanghai Municipal Council era. After the Japanese occupation of the concession during the Pacific War, he was responsible for guarding the British concentration camp. After the victory, a British national named Hua Sheng accused Ka of using the enemy's power to oppress people. The defendant denied it in court yesterday.

Collecting Foil Ash to Aid the Enemy

(3) Feng Xiaozhai served as the chairman of the pseudo-Shanghai Foil Ash Industry Association during the enemy and puppet period and was accused of collecting tin foil ash to aid the enemy and melting it for military use. The above three cases were adjourned for further questioning.

[Another Report] The High Procuratorate has now indicted Tian Tiefu, Wu Huanian, Chen Mingde, and Xue Asi for suspected treason, and Tang Xianxin for suspected internal disorder.

### Municipal Government Considers Staff Reduction: Meeting to Discuss Today

The principles and steps for staff reduction will be discussed and decided at today's municipal government meeting.

### German Catholic Priest Arrested and Escorted to Shanghai on Suspicion

Ellen, a German Catholic priest, 40 years old, fluent in Chinese, recently intended to make some attempt in Xuzhou by using the identity of a priest to preach. He changed the Shanghai to Nanjing passport issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Shanghai to Xuzhou with a decolorizing potion. On the 14th of this month, he went to Xuzhou with the staff of the General Relief Administration and stayed at the Xuzhou Catholic Church. His words and deeds were suspected by the priest of the church, and he reported the information to the Xuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office. After dispatching personnel to arrest Ellen, it was discovered that the passport had been altered, and detailed Chinese maps, radio receivers, and important secret documents were found. As things were suspicious, it was found that it was related to a certain case in Shanghai, so he was escorted to the Songhu Garrison Command Military Law Office for interrogation. The Military Law Office is now studying it in detail.

### Handling the Sun Tianchangzhi Case: Investigation Team Releases Details; Complicated Case Awaiting Detailed Investigation by the High Court; Believes Sun's Wife's Activities Everywhere Are Quite Wrong

(Our Own Report) The Investigation Team has decided to end its work and return to the capital at the end of the month. The progress of handling various cases in the past two months will be published in a list soon. For unfinished cases, Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen will continue to be responsible for handling them. As for the Sun Tianchangzhi case, the handling process was released yesterday as follows:

Our team has always believed that this case is an important case for receiving and handling enemy and puppet assets. After receiving the secret report, our team first submitted it to the committee for deliberation and convened the director of the handling bureau and the review committee members to inquire about the case in detail. After reviewing the entire file, we learned that Sun Tianchangzhi's property had been seized and returned. Checking that it was a specific act of receiving and returning was a specific work of handling, our team was very concerned about whether this receiving and handling was improper. Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen was responsible for handling it, and the informant and Sun Tianchangzhi were summoned and interrogated separately. Committee Member Wu Wangji also reviewed the case and concluded that the case was complicated. If the judicial authorities were not entrusted to conduct a detailed investigation, it would not be enough to understand the extent of improper handling or improper receiving. Therefore, it was proposed to the committee for deliberation and transferred to the Shanghai Higher People's Court Procuratorate for investigation. This move was originally to respect judicial authority and clarify the case. During the investigation, the original informant and Sun Tianchangzhi should be investigated and should not rely on any forces to influence the case. However, it is heard that Sun Tianchangzhi's wife is active everywhere, distributing leaflets, hoping to rely on extrajudicial forces to resist legal power, which is quite wrong.

According to its legal experts' observation: The Investigation Team handled this case quite carefully and legally. If Sun Tianchangzhi is a Japanese, his property is enemy property. If he is not a Japanese, but the property obtained by using enemy and puppet forces is also subject to confiscation. If there is a behavior of offering planes and manufacturing military supplies to aid the enemy, it constitutes a war crime.

### Watching the Tide in the Rain: Returning from Gaoqiao All Soaked

[Our Own Report] According to the report of the Observatory, yesterday was the highest tide day of this year. The Public Works Bureau specially invited the local news media to Gaoqiao Seawall to watch the tide yesterday morning and to visit the completed restoration project of the breach in the seawall.

Those who went to visit yesterday included Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Structural Department of the Public Works Bureau and Commander of the Seawall Project; Zhu Qingyu, Deputy Commander; and Commissioner Qian Weiyu, as well as 13 reporters from various newspapers. Although the rain was pouring down, they were all in high spirits. They boarded the municipal ferry at 8:30 AM and arrived at their destination two hours later. At that time, because it was not yet high tide, the water surface was still more than 20 meters away from the embankment. Unable to withstand the rain for a long time, they went to the seaside bathhouse cafeteria to chat. At about 1:00 PM, it was the saturation point of the tide. They set off again in the rain and stood on the seawall, seeing only a vast ocean, with the beach all submerged. According to Director Zhu, if the seawall is not repaired this year, the consequences will be unimaginable. If a high tide like yesterday's comes, the embankment will collapse completely, and the entire town of Gaoqiao will be in danger.

At 2:30 PM, after eating at the office of the Engineering Headquarters of the Gaoqiao Public Works Bureau, they boarded two large and small trucks prepared by the bureau and rushed to the Municipal Ferry Terminal. The small truck broke down halfway due to muddy roads and damp machine parts. So everyone had to squeeze into a large, open-top truck carrying gravel to get on the road. When the ferry arrived, it was already past 6:00 PM. The rain was still heavy, and everyone was soaked.

### Australia Also Feels the Housing Shortage: Food and Clothing Still Strictly Rationed: Australian Envoy Speaks at Rotary Club

[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Rotary Club held a meeting at the Duchen Hotel yesterday. Australian Envoy to China Copeland gave a speech, stating that although Australia's losses in this war were not as severe as those of China, Britain, and other countries, to cope with this full-scale war, it also mobilized 60% of the country's men to engage in combat or war industries, and more than 30% of women. To adapt to wartime needs, labor control and rationing systems were implemented, prices were strictly controlled, and taxes on the people were heavy, so as to stabilize the economy and exert full effort to win the victory. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the number of Australian troops participating in actual combat was huge, and at the same time, a large number of essential materials were supplied to the US military and other Allied forces in the Pacific, India, and the Middle East. The loss of people's businesses was especially heavy, and the current housing shortage is also serious. Some farmland cannot be cultivated due to lack of fertilizer. Therefore, although various countries have a great need for Australian products, Australia has to temporarily devote its full energy to dealing with various domestic problems. However, wartime efforts have greatly increased Australia's production of food, textiles, steel, and chemicals needed for shipbuilding. Optical instruments and medicines have also made great progress. When the war broke out, the Australian government's income was 800 million pounds, which later increased to 1.25 billion pounds. Wartime prices increased by about 22.5%.

Australia still strictly implements the food and clothing rationing system. Because all textiles must first be supplied to the people of the country for distribution and sale, the quantity of exports must be limited. As for food, Australia's rice production is not large, with an annual output of only about 20,000 tons. Among them, a small amount is used for medical purposes and the needs of some local overseas Chinese, and the entire amount has been transported to the Middle East and Asia, hoping to be of small help in the midst of the world rice shortage. Although the quantity is small, it already includes the total amount of rice produced in Australia.

The current issues facing the Australian government are: (1) In addition to building 500 houses each year, at least 250,000 houses must be built first. (2) Reorganize and repair various major industries that have been damaged by the war, such as railways. (3) Increase the production of various items that are still insufficient, such as clothing, household appliances (electrical equipment and refrigerators).

Mr. Ke said at the end that any democratic country that wants to ensure freedom and security must pay attention to national defense and domestic stability. Therefore, Australia had to increase its budget by another 100 million pounds this year, and before the war, the entire budget was less than 100 million pounds, so the tax standard cannot be restored to the pre-war situation.

### The Grain Loan Embezzlement Case: Which Jurisdiction Will Hear the Case? Still a Mystery

[Our Own Report] Regarding the rumor that the Grain Loan Embezzlement Case has been ordered by the chairman to be heard by the judicial authorities, the reporter visited Quan Tao, the chief clerk of the District Procuratorate, yesterday.

It is reported that Wang Daren, Ren Xingya, Wan Lin, Wu Rongsheng, and other key figures in the Grain Loan Embezzlement Case are currently detained at the Songhu Garrison Command. The reporter then visited the person in charge of the Garrison Command, who said that the trial of the case could not be decided because no orders had been received.

### Land Administration Bureau Prepares to Levy Land Value Tax

[Our Own Report] The Municipal Land Administration Bureau is actively preparing to levy land value tax, which is planned to be held from November. The tax will be levied uniformly in the six districts of Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, and the suburbs. It is estimated that about 3 billion will be collected this year. In the municipal government budget approved by the City Council, more than 1 billion yuan has been allocated for the land value tax, which should make preparations easier. The land value tax has been delayed because the work is heavy and there are no funds.

### Where Is the Terminal for the No. 7 Bus? Awaiting Consideration

According to Deputy Director Zhang of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the bureau currently has six bus routes in operation, and now it plans to add a seventh route. Its starting point is set as Hongkou Park, and the route is roughly similar to that of Tram No. 1, in order to supplement the insufficiency of Tram No. 1. As for the terminal of the route, it is currently under consideration and will be decided within days. Furthermore, the resumption of British public buses is still unheard of. The bureau has ordered the company to submit a reply before November of this year, otherwise its operating rights will be revoked.

### Japanese War Criminal ShibaHaraHei Under Trial: Admits to Setting Up a Secret Room to Abuse Women: Military Tribunal Sends Personnel to Hangzhou to Investigate

[Our Own Report] Since the new President of the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal, Li Liang, and the Chief Clerk, Li Ye Chu, took office, they have actively reorganized the work and resumed the trial of Japanese war criminals yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the investigation court brought to trial the defendant ShibaHaraHei Sanlang (47 years old, from Tokushima Prefecture). During the invasion of China, he served as the information director of the Hangzhou Army Special Affairs Agency, the branch director of the Jinhua Special Affairs Agency, the chief of the political section, the Ningbo Security Section Chief, and the director of the Cixi Branch of the Army Liaison Department. The criminal is a Chinese expert, proficient in the Shanghai and Hangzhou dialects. During his tenure, in addition to spying on our country's military intelligence and collecting and controlling various materials, he also used local tyrants to recruit rogue hooligans as his henchmen, and induced women from good families to provide him with adultery. Hundreds of women in the Jinhua and Ningbo areas were insulted by him. The local residents hated him with gritted teeth. At that time, the Japanese authorities also handed him over to the Hangzhou Gendarmerie for legal proceedings because he was too evil, but he was not convicted because he had a special relationship with Watanabe, the head of the Special Affairs Agency. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai and hid in 18 Xingjiazhai. He was arrested by our military agencies and sent to the military tribunal. The criminal admitted that he had set up a secret room near the Sixth Park on Hubin Road in Hangzhou, dedicated to adultery and pleasure. Now the military tribunal has sent personnel to the Hangzhou area and requested the local government to notify various towns and villages that those who were humiliated by him during the occupation period can report as much as possible so that the criminal can be sentenced to death.

(2) The committee is about to end. It has decided to send a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to order the Shanghai District Court to maintain the prestige of the permits issued by the committee.

### Summer Property Tax Late Payment Fines: Reasons for Declaration Can Be Waived

The Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of summer property tax uses a four-part payment form. Citizens pay to the collection office according to the deadline listed on it. According to the interim rules for the collection of property tax, this deadline should be at least 14 days. However, it has recently been learned that when some households receive the payment form, the deadline is very tight, resulting in disputes over late payment fines. It is heard that the Finance Bureau has now stipulated that if the deadline for citizens to receive the payment form is less than 14 days, they can write the actual date of receipt of the payment form on the back of the second part of the property tax payment form, as well as "If it is found that the payment is overdue after investigation, I am willing to be responsible for paying the late payment fine as required." After the taxpayer signs and seals it, they can be exempted from paying the late payment fine. If some have already paid, they can state: (1) the name and address of the household, (2) the date of receipt of the property tax payment form, (3) the date of payment of the property tax, (4) the receipt number and amount of the late payment fine, and send a letter directly to the Finance Bureau's property tax section to request verification. If it is confirmed that the deadline has not been exceeded, the paid fine can be retrieved from the original payment location.

### American Military Tribunal Tries Nazi Spies: Refutes the Defendant's Lawyer's Fallacies

[Our Own Report] The American Military Tribunal here brought 27 suspected Nazi spies to trial at 8:00 AM yesterday. First, the judge refuted the arguments made by the defendant's lawyer during the last trial: (1) that the US military tribunal has no right to try Nazi war criminals in the country, (2) that the defendant's evidence of guilt is insufficient, that they are German expatriates, and that they should be released by the Chinese court. Lu Wei said: "Although the defendant resides in China, the crimes committed are not only violations of Chinese law, but violations of international law and custom. After Germany's unconditional surrender, the defendant continued to engage in military activities and assisted Japan in resisting the United States and its allies, so the work of trying such criminals still falls within the scope of the power of the American Military Tribunal. The trial by this court should continue." After a brief questioning, it was announced that the trial would resume on the 3rd of next month.

### President Truman Discusses the Importance of Cultural and Educational Organizations

Without Understanding, We Cannot Have Peace; Without Education, We Cannot Have Peace.

[US Information Service, 25th] President Truman met with members of the US National Commission for UNESCO at the White House today, shaking hands with each member: "I believe that cultural and educational organizations will contribute to world peace no less than other organizations related to the United Nations. They will awaken our power to strive for peace. When we understand the views of others and others understand ours, we can engage in discussions and abandon various disagreements. Without understanding, we cannot have peace; without education, we cannot have peace. If we can exchange educators with other countries and send our educators to various countries to proclaim our views, the clarification of the world situation will not be far off. Among the forty-eight member states of the United Nations, we will have no difficulties, or any difficulties that cannot be resolved peacefully, because we already understand each other. I attach great importance to the UNESCO, and I believe that if the organization carries out its work according to its original intention, it will make unprecedented and great contributions to the welfare of all mankind. In the world, what I most earnestly desire are two things: world peace and domestic unity. What I have done since entering the White House has been for this. This was also the working goal of President Roosevelt."

### Tang Zeng and Others Initiate "School Donation for Birthday Celebration": Six Methods Proposed

More than one hundred people from the educational and journalistic circles in this city, including Tang Zengjiao, Sun Dongcheng, Zhong Juemin, Qian Fugong, etc., had long proposed the establishment of universal national schools in view of the large number of out-of-school children and illiterates across the country. Now that the 60th birthday of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government is approaching, people across the country are preparing to offer congratulations to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. However, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, mindful of the difficulties facing the nation and the suffering of the people, believes that we should strive for governance and not merely engage in formalities and extravagance. The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang has issued an order for all party members to comply. The people of the whole country should also share the difficulties of the times, understand Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's intentions, and, without violating the principle of "no extravagance," seek other ways to benefit national construction and rejuvenation in order to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday. However, in this time of national revival, there are many ways to build the country, and we should choose the most important and pressing one to do first in order to meet the actual needs. At the same time, in fact, we should seek what is easily accepted by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After repeated consideration, Tang Zeng and others believe that popularizing national schools to promote national education, thereby helping out-of-school children and eliminating illiteracy across the country, is a more appropriate approach. Therefore, they propose the "School Donation" method. After its publication, it is heard that it has been enthusiastically responded to by all sectors of the city. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will also respond and contribute generously to share in this grand event. The methods for "School Donation" are explored and recorded below: (1) All provinces, cities, counties, and groups across the country should immediately formulate methods for people to voluntarily donate money and organize a "School Donation for Birthday Celebration Committee" to facilitate the process. (2) People's donations should be entirely voluntary. The donation goal should be that each province, city, and county, at least each autonomous region, should be able to add at least one national school. (3) On the day of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, each province, city, and county should separately present a list of the amount of donations and the units where national schools can be added to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express congratulations, and also publish it in newspapers to inform the public. (4) These national schools should all be prefixed with the words "Kai-shek" to show permanent remembrance. (5) These national schools should be completed by the end of this year and open at the same time in early spring next year, so that out-of-school children and all illiterates across the country can be helped as soon as possible. (6) In addition to donations, donations of houses and land for use as school buildings and for the construction of school buildings may be included.

### Charity Basketball Game Tonight: Qunsheng Faces Giants Team

Journalists vs. Movie Stars at 7 PM

[This Newspaper] Since arriving in Shanghai, the Qunsheng basketball team has demonstrated superb skills, winning all four games, astonishing the Shanghai sports scene. The Basketball Committee, previously lacking more than 7 million yuan for building a floor, took this opportunity to invite the guest team to play a charity game against the strong Western team, the Giants, in order to make up for the deficit. Tonight's revenue, after deducting expenses, will be used to subsidize the shortfall. Tickets are still priced at 2,000 yuan for the upper level and 5,000 yuan for the lower level. Complimentary tickets will not be issued, and military and police personnel must purchase tickets to enter the stadium in order to increase revenue. At the same time, in order to avoid congestion, ticket sales will begin at 3 PM, and the gates will open at 5:30 PM.

News Reporters Face Off Against Movie Stars

In the first game, journalists will face off against movie stars. The former is organized by sports reporters from various newspapers in the city. Usually, the reporters just talk on paper, pointing fingers and commenting, but today they will put aside their ink and paste, put on their uniforms, and show off their skills, letting the fans see the "work" of the reporters. Because the members of the reporter team are composed of reporters from various newspapers, in order to avoid self-promotion, the "unique skills" and masterpieces of the team members will not be promoted in advance. The movie star team has already been famous in the city before the war, and is now resurrected. All the members are shining stars on the screen. The lineup is even more complete than before the war. In addition to Liu Qiong, Jin Yan, and Liang Dusheng, Shu Shi, Ren Yawei, Chen Tianguo, etc., are tall and strong, and Wang Xuewu has also joined the lineup, so once they meet, the movie stars are more likely to win.

Giants are Good at Calculating: Qunsheng Should Be Wary

The main game starts at 8 PM, with Qunsheng facing the Giants. In terms of the situation, Qunsheng can undoubtedly beat the Giants. However, in terms of tactics, the Giants are known in Shanghai for their cunning and resourcefulness, and their ability to see through people's weaknesses. The Giants players all came to watch when Qunsheng took the field, so they are confident. At that time, they will use unexpected strategies to win, and Qunsheng must be careful.

Can the current head of household sign and seal on behalf of the former head of household?

### Yesterday Another Surge of 500,000 - Rayon Creates Unprecedented High Price - Spinning & Construction Listing Increased by One Million From Previous - Italian Goods Have Been Shipped, 600 Cases

[Our Report] Yesterday, the rayon price surge was even more intense. No. 120, Tianqiao Youguang opened at 3.65 million yuan, jumped to 8 million yuan at closing. In the afternoon, because the listing price of the Spinning and Construction Company was one million higher than the previous period, and the allocation quantity was reduced, the black market was wildly inflated, shouting from 8 million yuan to 4.1 million yuan. In the end, it was sold for 15 million yuan. General real sales manufacturers were at a loss and panicked, all believing that the allocation of the Spinning and Construction Company was inappropriate, forcing manufacturers to bankruptcy. According to industry insiders, rayon is not produced in our country and has always relied on countries such as Japan and Italy for supply. After the victory, due to the lack of commercial agreements, transportation and sales were difficult. However, the outer-area electric motors, knitting, silk edging factories, and other factories in need of rayon, rely on rayon merchants' inventory supply, as well as enemy and puppet materials received by the government, which are distributed and sold by the Spinning and Construction Company in installments. However, since September 5th, the allocation and sales of rayon merchants have been cancelled, purely allocated to production manufacturers. Since then, the rayon market situation has been rising continuously. This is because rayon is not produced domestically, unlike cotton yarn, and its sales are not limited to electric motor silk weaving factories. Factories in this and other areas are afraid of a shortage of goods, and all are trying to find them. The less goods allocated by Spinning and Construction, the more urgent the demand, leading to the unprecedented high price of rayon. As for the rayon merchants' own inventory, it is extremely limited. Since Spinning and Construction stopped allocating, routine operations have become even more difficult to carry out. The Rayon Trade Association has written to the Spinning and Construction Company for this appeal. It is now known that a reply has been received from the Spinning and Construction Company, roughly stating that after the Central Trust Bureau ships rayon from Japan, they will consider the allocation method again.

The Cost of Italian Rayon - 1.15 Million

Two batches of Italian rayon have recently arrived, totaling 600 cases. It is reported that 400 of these cases are goods ordered by people outside the industry, with a cost price of 500,000 yuan per case, and taxes and fees of 650,000 yuan, totaling 1.15 million yuan per case. The reporter then visited Director Jiang of the Business Department of the China Spinning and Construction Company to inquire about the company's allocation of rayon. He specifically stated two points: First, the rayon allocated by Spinning and Construction is all owned by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, and Spinning and Construction is only acting as an agent for allocation and sales.

Allocation Price Has Not Moved for a Long Time - New Market is Still Low

Second, after the exchange rate adjustment, the allocation price has remained unchanged, at 1.3 million yuan per case. However, the market has risen sharply. During yesterday's allocation, because the market price had reached more than 3 million yuan, the allocation price was slightly adjusted, but it was still about 70% lower than the market price. To date, more than 10,000 cases have been allocated in succession. It is said that, in terms of the production manufacturers applying for allocation alone, there are about 200 companies each time. Ordinary manufacturers get one case each, while elastic band factories, etc., mostly get one case for every four companies. Yesterday, more than 200 cases were allocated. It is also heard that the Central Trust Bureau has ordered 10,000 cases of rayon from Japan, and 3,000 cases have already arrived in Shanghai.

### Government Bonds Gradually Decline

Government bonds are still under sporadic supply, unable to rally. Tong Bing opened at 1,890 yuan, with a high price of only 1,930 yuan, which was blocked and fell. The market was low to 1,730 yuan, and closed at 1,800 yuan. As a result, it fell 210 yuan from the previous close. The rest also decreased by 100 yuan to 150 yuan. The transaction volume was still more than 3 million yuan.

### Foreign Stock Transactions Were Scarce

There were not many foreign stock transactions. People from the Chaozhou community had a slight appetite for Jardine Matheson, but it was difficult to save the overall situation. Ewo Cotton opened at 8,800 yuan, with sporadic liquidation, and then retreated to 8,300 yuan. The steel industry's transactions were quiet, without any changes. As a result, Ewo Cotton, British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, paper industry, and shipping each fell by about half a percent compared to the previous close. The steel industry was flat.

### Rice Market Firm

[Our Report] Yesterday, more than 10,000 dans of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The Social Affairs Bureau also threw out a large batch of rice. The appetite of the shops was still acceptable, and the trend was stable. The flour factory allocated and sold 9,000 bags to another sales company, and the price remained unchanged. The wheat from the north and south oceans was cleared. Soybeans from the South Ocean were moving but not prosperous. Dalian soybeans had slight transactions. Medium-grade soybeans still did not escape fatigue. Raw peanuts fell and stabilized. Sesame remained flat, but black sesame was prominent. Corn was sluggish and flat. Red sorghum was very greedy in the wineries and saw another increase of 1,000 yuan. Mung beans fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The broad bean market was stable. In the oil market, goods from Qingdao were still available, and raw oil was still tired. Soybean oil was in short supply and still in demand. Vegetable oil was firm. Soybean cake from Taiwan was slightly inquired about for fertilizer. Raw cake from the South Ocean was also actively cleared.

### Amidst the Spreading Surge - Silk Prices Are Also Being Driven Up - Medium Grade Exceeds 3 Million

In recent days, the black market for US dollars has been surging, and the raw silk market has also been affected by a big wave. From Monday to today, the average price of raw silk of all grades has risen by more than 20%. It is reported that the reason for the surge is: (1) Silk factories in various places have borrowed cocoon processing loans from China Sericulture Corporation for ABCDEF grades of raw silk, so all finished products above F grade are purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. It is also heard that China Sericulture Corporation is still continuing to handle cocoon processing loans, and the Central Bank's Central Trust Bureau, China Sericulture Corporation, and Raw Silk Inspection Institute will organize a Silk Export Committee to expand the purchase of raw silk and expand exports. Therefore, in the future, raw silk with new inspection certificates above F grade will not be easy to market, and the current inventory is also thin, that is, the number of medium-grade user raw silk below F grade is only about 2,000 dans. However, due to the start of real sales, silk factories are also greatly replenishing raw materials, and the appetite for medium-grade raw silk Sichuan households is strong. The holders are unanimously optimistic and firmly refuse to sell. (2) Due to various rumors favorable to raw silk, the psychology of the holders is more firm, so the buyers are more forceful in absorbing, mutually pushing up, soaring, so that the medium-grade raw silk protrudes from the 3 million yuan mark, creating the highest new record in nearly two months. According to industry insiders, if the international raw silk market is stable, the surge will be difficult to stop for a while.

### Passengers Carrying Gold - Customs Must Verify Passports

Ornamental Gold Must Not Exceed Weight

Regarding the issue of restricting the import of gold and ornamental gold, according to the person in charge of the Jianghai Customs, for the import of gold, a passport from the Ministry of Finance must be submitted for verification before it can be released. Passengers carrying gold ornaments can be released after checking the regulations. (1) Ornamental gold refers to old gold that is in the shape of ornaments and is made entirely or partially of gold. (2) The gold ornaments must be for the passenger's current attire or for personal use. (3) The total amount of pure gold contained in the ornaments must not exceed 37.7994 grams. Violators will have all the gold or ornaments they carry detained and handed over to the Ministry of Finance for verification.

### Allocated Yarn Still Expected to Rise - Spinning & Construction Cloth Prices Double - Tianjin Community's Route Mostly Transfers to Guandong - Foreign Cotton Still Settles at the Old Rate, Difficult to Fulfill Wishes

[Our Report] The yarn market is firmly grounded. When the market opened in the morning, people's hearts were still indifferent, and the quoted price was similar to yesterday's market. 42 counts of spot goods were priced at 2.84 million yuan, and 20 counts were priced at more than 1.8 million. Subsequently, due to the constant demand from all directions, the buying intention was strong, and the price rose frequently. The root cause is the odd shortage, continuous purchase, and frequent demand. The joint allocation and sales of the Spinning and Construction Company cannot be fully supplied, and the allocation price is rising period by period. The rightful demanders cannot get the appropriate amount of demand, and they have to search and purchase at high prices in the black market. Both 20 counts and 42 counts

### Market Situation Gradually Stabilizes - Fried Red US Dollar Continues to Fall

Fried red was very stable yesterday. The market opened in the morning at around 2.17 million, and people's hearts were already tired. From 2.173 million, it gradually fell slightly, but there was a lot of struggle around 2.16 million. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 400 bars at a price of 2.1625 million, and people's hearts finally became empty. Before noon, the price dropped sharply to a low of 2.145 million, and then it stabilized slightly. At noon, it stood at around 2.15 million. In the afternoon, the Guang community bought slightly. It was heard that the price of gold in Hong Kong rose, and the next-day transaction rose to 2.16 million. Later, because the US dollar was still weak, it was forced to retreat. As a result, it fell 12,000 yuan from the previous close. Ornamental gold, silver ingots, and silver dollars were all flat, and dark interest was still around 1.5%.

The foreign exchange US dollar also fell slightly, and the situation has stabilized. The market opened in the morning with a sale at 3,980 yuan. Although there were buyers after the opening, there was a whole batch waiting to be sold at the price of 4,000 yuan. Midway, it was difficult to retreat, and it turned stable at 3,900 yuan. At noon, it lingered around 3,950 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still flat at first, but finally fell slightly. As a result, it fell 50 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were stable and changed little, hovering around 780 yuan. The result was the same as the previous close, but the buying price retreated by one level. Hong Kong exchange was also flat. Hong Kong China Electric recovered slightly. Yesterday, it was sold at 780 yuan. Indian exchange also retreated to 960 yuan for sale. British exchange was 12,500 yuan to 12,700 yuan. Although the US exchange rate was flat, there was no action. 34,000. Because the 16 counts had risen too sharply in recent days and had exceeded the price of 20 counts, yesterday was still calm. In the afternoon, the market situation was still firm, because the search from all sides was relentless, and the price also rose. It was heard that the 42 counts order had been priced at more than 2.8 million, and the 20 counts were even more firm. Private yarn factories, in view of the strong real sales, had high thoughts and requested the authorities to relax. According to authoritative news, there are still tens of thousands of pieces of calico that were allocated before the exchange rate change, and they requested settlement at the old rate. However, due to the trend of the situation, it is feared that they will not be able to fulfill their wishes, so the price of allocated yarn may have to rise again.

In the cloth market, except for 3A calico, which opened at 84,000 yuan, and Four Gentlemen old goods, which opened at 100,000 yuan, the transactions of various colored cloths were still lively. When the Spinning and Construction Company opened 20 counts of unbranded calico and suddenly rose to 66,000 yuan, and unbranded calico rose to 77,000 yuan, each rose by nearly 10,000. White printed drill opened at 92,000 yuan, and Shuiyue Shilin opened at 120,000 yuan. The former rose by 114,000 yuan compared to the previous period, and the latter rose by tens of thousands. After this influence, there was a random shout, and the price finally rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Subsequently, because the price of goods was too high, real sales temporarily stopped, and it became sluggish. It was heard that the route of the Tianjin community has been the most prosperous in recent days, and most of them are transferred to the nine provinces of the East, of which the red cloth has reached more than 30,000 pieces.

### Longs Successively Unload - China Stocks Have Been Weak

China stocks had few buyers yesterday. Even if there were advances from the Guang and North communities, the number was not large and was easily overwhelmed by floating longs. After seeing a low opening, they failed to recover. After the opening, they showed a slight firmness, but were soon overwhelmed. Under the widespread liquidation, they gradually became tired. There were few twists and turns in the middle, and the transaction volume also appeared idle. After 11:30, the shorts began to cover their positions. If the financial community, such as China Trust No. 44, purchased Mayar, the Guang community also slightly accepted yarn factories, and once showed show, but when the market closed, the North community made some settlements, and the Guang community also sold the company, and it became weak again. As a result, Yongsha, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by about half a percent compared to the previous close. Mayar fell slightly. Among the cold stocks, Zhongtong and Jinglun fell slightly. Zhongfang, Rongfeng, underwear, silk, Huafeng, and Wuhe fell by half or so. Xinhe, Datong, Xinya Company, Lianan Matches, and Cement each fell by about 10%. The total transaction volume was more than 7.76 million shares, and the off-market stocks also brought a small amount.

### Hongji Lump Coal Will Be Allocated

The white coal market continues to advance towards the peak. Buyers are all watching because of the high price, so the actual transaction volume is limited, and the price is extremely chaotic. The Hongji lump coal of more than 800 tons purchased by the Coal Business Joint Office has been recently transported with the permission of the Fuel Committee. The shareholders' meeting will be held on the 7th of this month to discuss the price and allocation method. The high-quality bituminous coal Huai continued to rise slightly, and the charcoal also rose due to the rise in white coal.

### Sugar List Price Remains Unchanged

Yesterday, the sugar market was soft due to weak sales and the period of the joint Taiwan company's bidding. The total bidding price was 170,000 yuan for coarse sand, 130,000 yuan for medium sand, and 110,000 yuan for raw sand. The association's allocation was soft. The spot price was 134,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan for medium sand, and 118,000 yuan for raw sand. The Shantou community's cotton red opened at 120,000 yuan, Diaoqing at 108,900 yuan, and other Xinghua at 114,670 yuan, and Xingchi at 128,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan.

This policy is mostly from the hand of Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen. Stevens said: "The Nanjing government is establishing government-controlled companies to compete with private industry." He predicts that the government's "bureaucratic capital" will eventually occupy all important industries outside of the communist areas.

### On the Huai River (5)

— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

Bengbu, 14th

The true state of the Huai River region is like a pair of tossed plates, with water and the flames of war stirred into a single mass.

The night train to Bengbu on the Jinpu Railway arrives late at night. In Bengbu, a cannon blast at 11:30 PM marks the beginning of curfew. After midnight, travelers are not allowed to enter the city and are forced to spend the night at the station. A flashlight reveals a sea of people, their deep island slumber punctuated by snores in the autumn dew. The lamplight is dim, and the shadows of war loom all around.

A railway man confided in me, lamenting how easily they are harassed by soldiers. For the past half-year, wherever the troops pass, almost every station has witnessed a full-blown conflict. He himself has been beaten. Just a few days ago, the stationmaster of Lingjiaqiao, south of Su County, received a thorough thrashing. The reason is simple: they cannot accept the commanding requests of these soldiers and junior officers. These demands are often ridiculous and violate common sense regarding railway operations, such as issuing waybills immediately or preventing later passenger trains from departing first. The Military Affairs Commission's order that "soldiers must not interfere with the stationmaster's authority over railway operations" is ineffective. Unless each stationmaster has a colonel's insignia and a pistol, they will immediately stand at attention and offer no resistance, forgetting their itching fists. This is much more effective than reasoning.

Meeting with Xia Wei

Xia Wei, commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone, is a general from the Northern Expedition who defended southern Guangxi during the Anti-Japanese War, earning military merits. He is now stationed in Bengbu. When I returned from Zhengyangguan, I sent my card to visit him. He gladly received me and humbly said, "I do not know much, but I am willing to answer to the best of my knowledge."

Our conversation lasted only 20 minutes, but within the military scope, I gained an outline of the situation in Anhui Province and two conclusions.

(1) All counties in Anhui Province are now under government control. Some places were once "liberated areas," but most were not. In those former "liberated areas," armed forces are still harassing the National Army. Elsewhere, some claiming to be Communist troops are also active. The local situation is mostly unstable. Those claiming to be Communist troops are actually bandits. If the Communist Party uses them, they become Communist troops. Xia Wei concluded, "A bandit is a bandit. Just because the Communist Party uses them does not mean they are no longer bandits, or that claiming to be Communist troops makes them no longer bandits."

(2) Regarding Li Xiannian's forces, he said, "Three thousand men are fleeing towards central Anhui, but due to casualties along the way, only a little over a thousand will be able to cross the Huainan Railway and reach northern Jiangsu." Beyond that, he could not confirm that any other Communist troops had passed through Anhui Province. However, Communist troops are still present in western Anhui, namely Zhang Tixue's forces. He admitted this, but said, "Only a few hundred men."

I had learned that a part of the Communist forces had passed through Yingshan, via Sanhejian, crossed the Ying River, and reached the outskirts of Xuzhou. His subordinates told me, "They were originally bandits who later became part of Li Xiannian's Communist forces, and now they are not anymore, only a few hundred men."

Extended Talk with the Commissioner

Communist troops, those claiming to be Communist troops, those claiming to be Communist troops acknowledged by the Communist Party, puppet troops incorporated by the Communist Party, bandits who claim nothing, bandits who were originally bandits and then quit the Communist forces, former puppet troops waiting for reorganization who refused to join... The National Army controls the cities and transportation routes. Elsewhere, armed forces of unclear identity are constantly active, and all sides tend to call them Communist troops uniformly. Anhui local newspapers also frequently publish news of "Communist troops harassing everywhere," and the result is naturally fighting everywhere. The outcome of the battles? That is a question of no importance.

Here are some recent "military updates," which illustrate the difficulties faced by the Anhui government: 1. The Communist Army's Independent Regiment Commander from western Guilin, with over a thousand men, infiltrated Taihu from Qianshan; a part of them, over six hundred, have retreated back to Biaolin River in Qianshan. 2. Zhang Tixue's forces, approximately five hundred men, harassed Chen Han in Susong County, and after being intercepted, fled to Qiujia Mountain in Huangmei. 3. Liu Xianzheng, commander of the Communist Army's Jiangbei Brigade, recently led over eight hundred men from Jiangnan to Qi Tou Zui, Baishi Mountain, and Yin Ping Mountain in Wu and Fu Counties, engaging in activities. 4. Over twenty thousand defeated Communist troops from north of Lingbi and along the Tuo River have been conscripting thousands of laborers daily in Chenchangji and Shiji, building pontoon bridges and constructing fortifications. 5. Wei Fenglou's Communist forces, with Wu Youshou, Jin Shaoshan, and others, totaling over eight thousand men, infiltrated Hao County from Dacheng, Zhecheng, and other places in eastern Henan, cutting off the Shangqiu-Bozhou highway.

The Fourth Administrative Region of Anhui Province, including Mengcheng, Huaiyuan, Wuhe, Siyang, and Lingbi counties, is experiencing the heaviest fighting and suffering the greatest hardships. It is necessary to hear the voices of local officials. The Commissioner's Office is in Su County. I went to Su County to see Commissioner Liao Ziying, and we had a long conversation in the quiet Commissioner's Office. He pointed northeast and southwest, saying, "There are Communist troops there."

"It is hard to be an honest official, and impossible to be a corrupt one." The 59-year-old commissioner said with emotion. He is from Fengtai County, graduated from the Anhui Military Academy during the Guangxu era, and was a brigade commander during the Northern Expedition. He was transferred from southern Anhui this July.

Impression of the Commissioner's Office

The weather was very hot during our conversation, and we were sweating. He said it was good that it was hot because it would help the crops grow strong. He heard that firewood was needed for cooking, and here it costs 100 yuan per catty, but the military only pays 5 yuan, the prescribed price. Each person needs at least two catties per day, which is only ten yuan. I couldn't help but ask, "How do you make up for the difference?" He raised his head and stared at the beam above, not saying a word. Then he stood up and pointed out the window, saying to me that the building next door was a middle school that couldn't open. "At a meeting the day before yesterday, we found that over one hundred and eighty desks and benches were missing." So he sat down to drink some tea, sighed deeply, and said, "Weapons are tools of destruction. There are no soldiers in the world who do not disturb the people. This thing is extremely destructive. The country should not resort to military force unless absolutely necessary. To be fair, military discipline is not as good as during the Anti-Japanese War!"

The salary for staff in the Commissioner's Office is 180 yuan, plus a living subsidy of 35,000 yuan, nothing else. Eating two meals of corn buns and congee a day costs 37,500 yuan. The orderly gets 17,500 yuan, which is not enough to eat. The salary is only 32 yuan, which is incredibly low. They don't have clothes or shoes. The Commissioner's Office's public expenses are 32,000 yuan per month, and travel expenses are 17,600 yuan. Postage alone costs over 10,000 yuan a month. There are no telegrams. A bucket of kerosene costs tens of thousands of yuan, not to mention paper, ink, and brushes.

"I told Chairman Li that the inspectors are unnecessary. 17,600 yuan is not enough for a single field trip. Now, if we want to send people out to inspect, we will inevitably disturb the local people." Regarding grassroots politics, he said, "The commissioner's responsibility is not as great as the township head's. The township head is responsible for everything: people's property, construction, education, and grain. Today's township head is not afraid of the county magistrate, only the court. But the court doesn't care about bad people, only good people. Anhui has trained 100,000 local cadres. If they were of one heart and mind, these people could naturally control the county magistrate from above and educate the people from below. But what can you get from three months of training? They wear good clothes, but the result is that they do more bad things than good things."

He told me that he was the county magistrate of Guoyang County for a year during the Anti-Japanese War, and Peng Xuefeng's Communist troops came to engage in a united front. "It was truly a year of knives against knives and guns against guns! I told Peng Xuefeng, 'Don't come to Guoyang to cause trouble. If I were a corrupt official who deserved to be shot, that would be one thing. Otherwise, if you come and cause trouble, I will fight. He couldn't do anything to me.'" As a result, after he left office a year later, the twenty-seven townships in Guoyang County were completely transformed. He concluded, "The human factor is very important."

Now, there are several thousand demobilized youth troops in Su County. The county wants to assign them as township guards, but they all refuse, yet they stay there receiving money and eating. The local area bears over one million yuan per month. Commissioner Liao said that it is really not easy to establish township offices in Wuhe, Si County, and Lingbi. It is a matter of life and death. Communist troops in plain clothes are still ambushing everywhere. Are those with any ability willing to do it? But those without ability cannot handle it. So, the old commissioner shook his head again.

For dinner, we had congee, corn buns, and four bowls of plain vegetable stew, without any oil: greens, mung bean sprouts, greens stir-fried with tofu skin, and a plate of green chili peppers. Because there were guests at noon, the commissioner had added two meat dishes. There was still some left over for dinner. I was invited to sit down, and after we finished eating, the commissioner asked the orderly to take the bowl of unfinished stir-fried sauce upstairs to save for another meal.

Relief Work

Relief work here is quite tense. The branch office is located in Wuhu, and the Bengbu office is an outpost. Half of the staff of the branch are on the road. In Bengbu, I saw Deputy Director Ke Yufu, who said, "The work in northern Anhui is very important. UNRRA will also come here to set up an office. We are looking for a building." He summarized the work of the branch office up to the end of August, providing a detailed explanation including livelihood, hygiene, storage and transportation, agriculture, industry, and recent plans.

Under the item of livelihood, there are two parts: "relief" and "work relief." The scope of "work relief" is very broad, including repairing dikes and dams, dredging rivers and blocking breaches, repairing school buildings, organizing cleaning teams, running sewing factories, and even renovating the roads in Wuhu and Bengbu. This is practically construction work, which inevitably reminds one of Roosevelt's Blue Eagle. Even now, relief work is material for political battles. In his report, under the "relief" item, he placed "promoting relief in Communist areas" on the same level as "sending refugees back to their hometowns, handling emergency relief in northern Anhui, providing relief to refugees along the Jinpu Railway, distributing old clothes and shoes, and establishing milk and flour stations." I couldn't help but ask, "Is there any bias?"

Deputy Director Ke said, "Relief work should not be divided by boundaries or political factions. The Anhui branch has specifically organized a work team for the northeastern Anhui area to go deep into Communist areas to carry out relief work, distributing over one hundred tons of flour, as well as old clothes, medicine, and milk powder. Team leader Huang Jinheng, along with Father Hua of the Bengbu Catholic Church and Drane, went to distribute these items. Recently, another 1,000 tons of flour were allocated to fifteen counties in northeastern Anhui, with Director Fu of our office responsible for supervising the distribution." He added, "We have no bias. Military actions have hindered us, but we will continue to go to Communist areas to do our work." However, once the war starts, the Communist Party's strategic requirement is to completely destroy all transportation lines behind the National Army. If necessary, they will breach the dikes to rely on water for defense, which goes against the work of the UNRRA. So the propaganda war plays out, with accusations flying. However, the Fei River estuary north of Fengyang County has been silted up for a long time, harming farmland. Using work relief, over 50,000 cubic meters of earth were removed, saving over 400,000 mu of farmland. This area is what the UNRRA calls the Communist area.

Thrilling Encounter

However, I still suspected whether they were biased and only doing a little bit of window-dressing on the surface. Huang Jinheng, the team leader of the work team for northeastern Anhui, gave me a very detailed explanation, recounting his thrilling work experience. He said:

In order to carry out work in the Communist area of northeastern Anhui, at the end of June, we contacted Zhou Enlai in Nanjing. He strongly approved and gave us a certificate and route instructions. We went to Huaiyin to contact the leaders of the Jiangsu-Anhui border government. We immediately took the route through Yangzhou and Shaobo and entered the Communist area, meeting with the commander of their military region in central China and the Minister of Health. Because of the military tension, the leaders of the border government were all in the countryside, but we finally met Vice Chairman Wei Pengdan. After discussions, it was agreed that a group would be formed with one representative each from the Communist Party, the branch office, and UNRRA, to decide on: (1) basing things on work relief, constructing the Huai dike, from Linhuai Pass to the Wuhe section. This project would be the responsibility of the Dike Restoration Engineering Bureau, increasing the amount of flour distributed (according to the regulations of the Dike Restoration Bureau, each cubic meter of earth receives two to four catties of flour) to comply with their policies. At the same time, (2) constructing the Hong Lake Dam, seventy-some li within Anhui, with the Anhui branch responsible for funding. (3) Dredging the Si River. (4) There are over 50,000 fishermen in Hongze Lake who have no fish to catch in the winter, needing relief. (5) In terms of hygiene, malaria, kala-azar, summer infectious diseases, and skin diseases are very common, needing medicine. Various places have "People's Hospitals," but they are only signs, lacking actual work.

After reaching the above conclusions, we returned to Wuhu from Huaiyin to report. We first transported nutritional supplies and medicines to meet urgent needs, including milk powder, penicillin, yellow and white petroleum jelly, DDT, summer vaccines, quinine, etc., over two hundred boxes. On July 28th, we hired a large wooden boat and set off eastward, with Zhuang Tongli from UNRRA accompanying us. After crossing Linhuai Pass for twenty li, we were strictly inspected. This was the first checkpoint. We showed them the certificates from Zhou Enlai and the border government. The response was that we could go ahead, but it was dangerous. Every seven or eight li, someone would inspect us, questioning us in detail. In some places, they even wanted to detain us. Fighting was taking place in Wuhe. When we arrived in Wuhe, the Communist troops had retreated, so we continued to Xuyi amid the shelling. The retreating Communist troops wanted the boat to cross the river and fired at the boat, seeing Zhuang Tongli wearing khaki clothes and thinking he was part of the Central Army, threatening us with hand grenades. We used all our persuasive skills, and every two or three li we were shot at. We finally arrived at Shuanggou in the evening. Gunfire was heard everywhere, and then there was another inspection by people from the Water Police Bureau. Seeing the foreigner's goods, they liked everything and wanted to take everything. The Communist troops had established the Sinan County government here. The next day, we went ashore, but their people had all fled. We only found their county magistrate through a local canal owner. They knew that we had supplies to deliver, and at this time, it was a period of military action. We held a meeting on the boat with their local representatives, who issued receipts, and we handed over the two hundred boxes of supplies to them.

That's how they ended a period of wandering. Leaving the Communist area was like entering no man's land, with no inspections. Back in Mingguang (Photo by Shao Shenzhi)

### Establish More Free Vocational Schools

Editor: Recently I saw that the various vocational mechanical schools newly established by the Ministry of Education are enrolling students with everything free except for room and board. Students outside of Shanghai should also enjoy this. I hope that educational authorities will establish more such schools in the future, regardless of location, and should also provide accommodation and meals. (Shengping)

### The Pain of Elementary School Dropouts

Gentlemen: Let an unfortunate person tell you about the pain of dropping out of school. Because of his family's financial situation, he does not have the means to pay the huge tuition fees, so he has to drop out of school. Watching so many classmates go to school with their schoolbags (they are happy), he is abandoned outside the school gate. He does not have the courage to ask the principal to enroll him, and he dare not step into the school gate because there are many mocking eyes searching for this kind of unfortunate person! The alma mater is lovely, but he cannot return to its embrace! Classmates are approachable, but he has no right to study with them. Teachers are respectable, but he cannot face them in the classroom. Gentlemen, can the unfortunate man attribute this pain of dropping out of school to God's anger? Or to the palm of fate? Many unfortunate dropouts are eagerly awaiting your generosity! (Hu Sihe)

### Discussion on Exchanging Deposits for Stocks

Editor: Recently, the issue of returning principal a thousandfold for fixed deposits has been hotly debated. I know that laws have been explained long ago. In my opinion, fixed deposits have better credibility, and banks account for the majority. It is best that each bank automatically determines a fair method, or returns the same amount of stocks based on the stock market price of the bank when the deposit was made. Depositors who do not want to be shareholders can transfer the stocks themselves. This method takes care of both sides, but the procedures may be quite troublesome. I hope experts will discuss this. Respectfully yours, Shenbao (Chen Xinzhong)

Reply to Jiang Yingjie: According to the reply from the Great China Rubber Factory to our newspaper, "The regulations for purchasing tires are intended for practical users, to prevent speculators from buying them all up. Now, the Public Utilities Bureau has canceled the issuance of permits on behalf of rickshaw companies for three-wheeled vehicles (i.e., Xingji Company), and the vehicle owners can pick them up themselves. Rickshaw companies retain vehicle licenses. As far as we know, receipts have always been issued, and they can also be used to purchase tires at our retail outlets. There is no inconvenience. If you do not have even this, it is clear that you are trying to buy tires without owning a vehicle, intending to resell them for profit. In addition to replying separately to Mr. Jiang, we hereby reply."

Reply to Ai Jue: We received a reply from the Municipal Engineering Bureau stating: "Regarding the matter of filling in the harbor and building roads at Fahua Harbor, this bureau has had road planning since 1936, but has not yet started construction due to limited funds. The rest is under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Bureau."

Reply to Li Jinmin and a resident of Kangjia Bridge: According to a letter from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau: "(1) This city has been using red, yellow, and green traffic lights for a long time, but the number is still small. This bureau is currently designing to convert all traffic lights on the main roads of the central district, such as Nanjing Road and Zhongzheng East Road, to three-color automatic lights to facilitate control. However, the cost of this equipment is very high. If the budget for installing lights next year can be approved, the conversion should be no problem. (2) Regarding the request to remove the four barbed wire fences near 40 Fanhuangdu Road, this has been forwarded to the Engineering Bureau."

Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Tinnitus and Hearing Loss

Qian Shende asks: I have recently been suffering from tinnitus. It doesn't sound when I'm still, but it "hangs" when I'm moving. My spirit and appetite are normal, but it affects my hearing. I have a history of otitis media and already have hearing loss, so it is now even more impaired. After examination, the ears are fine, and it is suspected to be caused by constipation. I have tried to clear my bowels, but there has been no improvement. I have also consulted an internist who said it is neurasthenia. Please advise on treatment methods.

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] It is not a middle ear disorder but middle ear sclerosis. An otolaryngology specialist must examine the eardrum to see if there are any perforations, check for nasal disease, and conduct hearing tests to determine the diagnosis and provide treatment.

(2) Kidney Inflammation

Yan Ruxian asks: My father is sixty-six years old. Three years ago, he suffered from hematuria, which occurred intermittently, but there was no pain and he did not feel any lower back pain. However, he does not want to drink tea, and the number of times he urinates at night has increased, while the amount of urine has decreased. The doctor said that the disease is in the kidneys, it is not easy to treat, and rest is best. In April this year, his feet became swollen after standing for a long time. The swelling did not subside, and the swelling has gradually increased over the past two months. Currently, the swelling has spread to the legs and lower body. How can I relieve the swelling? How can I cure it?

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] Immediately examine the urine to determine if there is kidney inflammation. The main principle of kidney inflammation patients is to limit the intake of water, salt, and protein to promote the reduction of edema. Which medicines to take must be determined by an internal medicine doctor after examination.

(3) Old Age Itch

Li Hongye asks: My mother is in her sixties and lives in the countryside. Two years ago, she suffered from wind itch. Although she has seen a doctor, she has not been cured. It recurs from time to time, causing her great suffering. Please advise on treatment methods.

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] Is the so-called wind itch the same as what is medically known as senile pruritus? Without more detailed information about the symptoms, I cannot make a definitive judgment.

### Reader's Letter - Requesting Health Authorities to Implement Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign

Patients Among Young People and Laborers are Most Vulnerable

Editor: Recently, I have seen a surge in the number of inquiries about lung disease in various newspaper mailboxes, which shows the rampant nature of tuberculosis bacteria and the increasing number of patients every day, which is a matter of great concern! Chinese people have always been known as the "sick men of East Asia." This city is densely populated, and the disease is extremely contagious. Most patients are young people and laborers. Once infected, it is a terminal illness. Once in the second or third stage, they are left to die. Both Chinese and Western doctors are helpless. I recently visited a sanatorium and saw a continuous stream of people coming for full-body checkups and X-rays, costing more than 10,000 yuan each time. The working class and the general poor can only sigh at the high costs! I hope that hospitals can give preferential treatment to poor patients on holidays, providing free X-ray examinations of the lungs, to promote the welfare of the poor and laborers. This is essential for strengthening the country and the race. I also hope that the municipal health authorities will promote the eradication of tuberculosis, so that this terrible infectious bacteria is not easily spread, which would be a great blessing to the citizens. I sincerely hope that the above opinions will be disclosed. Respectfully, Zhao Liu Shang

### Combating Incompetent Doctors and Fake Medicine

— Zhang Ming

The following news item was published in the Dagong Bao of this city on the 16th of this month:

"On the 14th, a comedic scene unfolded at the Chongqing Municipal Hospital, where Chinese and Western doctors engaged in an on-the-spot 'battle of skills.' It began when a Chinese medicine practitioner named Shi Danshu repeatedly placed large advertisements in various newspapers and periodicals, claiming to have invented a 'pulse diagnosis for lung diseases' that was unfailingly accurate. The Municipal Health Bureau, finding this claim extraordinary, ordered Dr. Shi to conduct a clinical experiment at the Municipal Hospital at 5 p.m. on the 14th. Two hospitalized patients, Zhang Yifu and Ren Zhengqiang, were brought out for him to diagnose. After taking their pulses, Shi concluded that Zhang Yifu had stage three lung disease with tubercles between the first and second ribs of his left lung, a cavity in his right lung, and decaying lower end; Ren Zhengqiang was in the late stage two of lung disease, with a cavity in his left lung and tuberculosis in his right lung. Subsequently, Chen Siyi, the section chief of the Health Bureau, instructed doctors at the Municipal Hospital to take the two patients to the X-ray room for fluoroscopy. This proved that Zhang Yifu's lungs were normal and healthy, and Ren Zhengqiang had only one calcified spot on the upper end of his right lung. This diagnosis was entirely inconsistent with Shi Danshu's findings. When Chief Chen asked Shi to explain the discrepancy, Shi Danshu was greatly embarrassed and in a state of utter discomfiture. The Health Bureau has ordered Shi Danshu to cease his business operations, stop publishing advertisements, and await investigation and punishment."

In the present era, where advertisements for incompetent doctors and fake medicines are rampant, this news is as refreshing as a cooling powder, bringing a sense of great satisfaction. The Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau did not adhere to the primary rule of bureaucracy – "it's better to do less than more" – nor did it dismiss this as a "minor matter." Instead, they handled the situation in a scientific, decisive, and fair manner. We express our respect to the Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau.

In Shanghai, countless swindlers masquerade as doctors, treating patients' lives as a game. Regardless of whether a patient is ill or not, or whether the treatment is appropriate, they perform unnecessary surgeries to line their pockets. Among the advertising doctors, how many truly prioritize medical ethics and service? How many do not treat medicine as a business, putting money ahead of service? As for medicine, fake and inferior drugs flood the market, and some cunning pharmaceutical companies are even given certificates of approval by the health authorities, enabling them to publish deceptive advertisements in newspapers.

In the freest countries like the United States and England, unethical medical advertising is also subject to government prohibition because medicine affects the health of the people and the future of the nation, it cannot be treated as ordinary commerce and ordinary commodities.

It is hoped that the health authorities in this city will quickly catch up, strictly crack down on incompetent doctors and fake medicine, and protect the health of citizens.

### Tetanus

— Qian De

Its Pathogen and Prevention

Tetanus is a systemic toxemic condition caused by the exotoxins of tetanus bacilli infecting wounds. It is a serious infectious disease that is difficult to treat once contracted, but relatively easy to prevent, and the effect of prevention is very good. To understand how tetanus bacilli infect wounds and cause symptoms, we must first have some knowledge of the bacteria. They normally exist in the feces of cattle, horses, and humans. Once excreted, they exist in a spore state and are very resistant, immune to sunlight and ordinary drugs. Therefore, the bacteria contaminate everywhere, especially fields fertilized with feces, and any wound, whether from a gunshot, laceration, or even a splinter from glass, wire, or wood, or a small needle prick, can be infected if there is a break in the skin. The larger the wound, the greater the possibility of infection. Once infected, the bacteria remain localized.

The symptoms are produced entirely by the exotoxins produced by the bacteria, which travel through nerves, blood, and lymph vessels to the central nervous system, causing stimulation. Exotoxins are only produced in the absence of resistance. Therefore, although the bacteria normally exist in the sun or on the surface of the body and cause no harm, in a wound, the necrotic tissue provides the bacteria with more nutrients. If there is a mixed infection of pyogenic bacteria, which consumes oxygen and weakens the body’s defense – phagocytes – it allows the bacteria to thrive. Therefore, it can be said that the larger and deeper the wound, the more suitable it is for the bacteria to survive. Conversely, even if the wound is small, if bacteria are inoculated deep into the tissue, it can also cause harm. In addition, it is also possible for bacteria to be introduced through the incision during surgery (including illegal abortions), or for bacteria that were already present in a dormant state in an old wound to be reactivated by surgery, or for newborns to be infected during old-fashioned deliveries when unsterilized scissors are used to cut the umbilical cord.

Tetanus symptoms usually appear a few days to two or three weeks after infection, by which time the wound may have healed. The earliest symptoms are difficulty chewing, opening the mouth, and swallowing, followed by rigidity and contraction of the back and abdominal muscles, and opisthotonos. Minor stimulation and tremors can cause paroxysmal painful contractions of the muscles, leading to death within hours to one or two weeks from respiratory or heart failure or exhaustion. The most distressing thing is that the patient remains fully conscious.

However, the timing of the onset and outcome of the disease depends on the nature and location of the injury and whether preventive injections have been given. Generally, injuries to the head and face or infections in newborns result in earlier symptoms, poorer prognosis, and a mortality rate of over 95%. Those who have received preventive injections and appropriate medical treatment may not develop symptoms until one or two months later, and the symptoms may be chronic or localized. The outcomes in these cases are generally good. In general, if a patient survives for a week after the onset of symptoms, the chances of recovery increase with each passing day. Based on the above description, we can see that tetanus is a terrible disease, but its terribleness can be greatly reduced by prevention. The following are essential points to note:

(1) Do not use old-fashioned midwives for delivery.

(2) Pay attention to skin cleanliness and protect it properly to prevent tetanus bacilli from entering the tissue.

(3) For first aid in case of bleeding, flush the wound with tap water or cooled boiled water, and then apply sterile gauze. Do not sprinkle ashes or mud on the wound.

(4) Wounds should be treated in a hospital. Clean the wound, remove any foreign debris, and excise any dead tissue. Open the wound as much as possible and irrigate with oxidizing agents.

(5) Children and soldiers who are prone to injury should be injected with tetanus toxoid, two injections three weeks apart, to produce active immunity in the body. After an injury, give one booster shot to increase their resistance. If they have not received this preventive injection, they should be given antitoxin immediately after an injury, just in case.

(6) If tetanus symptoms have already appeared, send the patient to the hospital for treatment immediately.

### Everyone Should Have Knowledge of Tuberculosis Prevention

— Xu Changwen

Regarding tuberculosis prevention, there are at least two aspects to discuss: first, how to prevent patients with tuberculosis bacilli in their sputum from infecting healthy people; and second, how to enable early detection and early treatment of patients with early-stage tuberculosis, so that they do not progress to an aggravated and incurable state.

The first point is what most people consider tuberculosis prevention, including emphasizing personal hygiene, prohibiting spitting anywhere, isolating patients' food and drink, disinfecting tableware, keeping patients away from public places, and establishing sanatoriums, etc. Everyone knows this, but it is not effectively implemented. Perhaps the knowledge is not thorough enough, so the author will explain it here. Usually, there are many tuberculosis patients who, although suffering from stage two or stage three tuberculosis, can still move around with some difficulty, but their sputum must contain tuberculosis bacilli. If they spit anywhere, the tuberculosis bacilli in the sputum may fly in the dust after the sputum dries and be inhaled into the trachea by others, thus causing tuberculosis. Patients' food and utensils must be isolated from others. It is best to eat alone. However, if the environment does not allow it and they want to share a table with others, they must use sanitary chopsticks; at the same time, the bowls and chopsticks used by patients should be boiled in hot water for five minutes to prevent indirect transmission. When coughing, patients should turn away from others and cover their mouth and nose tightly with a handkerchief to avoid the splashing of sputum droplets and infecting others. Ordinary coughing in the sunlight can be seen spitting out one or two yards away. This distance is definitely beyond what most people can imagine. Even when patients talk, they should be at least ten feet away from ordinary people. The establishment of sanatoriums is for the treatment of patients on the one hand, and for isolating them from the outside world and preventing transmission on the other hand.

The second point is often overlooked by ordinary people, and this is what the author intends to particularly remind. At present, before effective drugs have been truly invented, the best principles for preventing and treating tuberculosis are "early detection and early treatment." Usually, people think that once they cough up blood, they suspect that they have tuberculosis, but there are also many cases where there are no symptoms of coughing up blood and they are already in stage two or even stage three tuberculosis. Therefore, to detect it early, we must pay attention to the early symptoms of tuberculosis that are often overlooked by ordinary people, such as easy fatigue, weight loss, etc. Once discovered, they should immediately undergo fluoroscopy of the lungs. It is even safer for ordinary people to have fluoroscopy once every three months, for a total of four times a year. The cost of such fluoroscopy is extremely low, even common laborers can afford it. If the results of four examinations are healthy, then they can be comfortable in body and mind for a year. If someone's lungs are clear in March and June, but black spots or unclear areas are found in September, then the scope of their lesions must be small, because the progression of tuberculosis is mostly slow, and the interval is only two or three months. If they can seize the opportunity and immediately follow the detailed guidance of a doctor and receive appropriate treatment, the results are often very good. Even if the lesions are found to be enlarged and spreading, compression therapy can be used to suppress them and achieve a nearly complete cure.

On the other hand, if a patient coughs up blood or has a severe cough and seeks medical attention, and after the doctor's diagnosis and medication, the symptoms gradually subside. If the patient mistakenly believes that the disease has been cured and ignores the changes in the lesions, and then seeks medical attention after the second and third relapses, then the lesions in the lungs have often spread or have ulcerated into cavities, and the patient's body is weak. At this time, even if the doctor tries his best to treat, the effect is difficult to determine, and the result is a waste of effort. If saved, the patient has suffered both mental anguish and economic loss.

Therefore, in addition to passively preventing the spread of sputum, we should also actively pay attention to the evolution of lesions, and "early detection and early treatment" is the only compass to avoid falling into the abyss of incurability.

### Hemoptysis (Coughing Up Blood)

— Police Officer Hao

If you have always been in good health and one day suddenly discover that your sputum contains blood, you will definitely feel very surprised and depressed, and immediately go to a doctor. Seeing a doctor is what you should do, but feeling alarmed and despondent is unnecessary, because this may even be your good fortune. The doctor may diagnose that you have a little tuberculosis in your lungs, and it is not difficult to treat it early. If it were not for the blood in your sputum, you would never have gone to see a doctor, so the disease may have progressed to a serious degree without your knowledge.

Among tuberculosis patients, those who cough up blood account for 50% to 90%. However, coughing up blood is not only caused by tuberculosis. Other chest diseases that can cause this symptom include: (1) pulmonary sclerosis, (2) mitral stenosis, (3) pertussis, bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema and other diseases with severe coughs, (4) chest trauma, (5) bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia, (6) pulmonary cysts, (7) bronchiectasis, (8) pulmonary infarction, (9) pulmonary tumors, pulmonary mycosis, pulmonary syphilis, (10) pulmonary fungal diseases such as candidiasis, etc., (11) aortic aneurysm rupturing into the lungs, (12) liver abscess or other abscesses rupturing into the lungs, (13) pulmonary parasitic diseases such as echinococcosis, paragonimiasis, etc.

Coughing up blood must be distinguished from vomiting blood, nosebleeds, and bleeding caused by oral cavity diseases. In addition, diseases of the blood itself, such as hemophilia, leukemia, purpura, and pernicious anemia, can also cause bloody sputum.

Bleeding from tuberculosis can be divided into two types: one type is caused by rupture of blood vessels, for example, blood vessels in tuberculous cavities in the lungs form aneurysms, and rupture of the aneurysms can cause a large amount of coughing up blood; the other type is caused by pathological changes in the walls of blood vessels that cause allergic reactions, increasing their permeability, so that blood plasma and blood cells are easily exuded. This type of bleeding is often very slight.

Finding the cause of coughing up blood and treating bleeding are the doctor's business. What the patient should pay attention to is, first, absolute bed rest, inhibiting coughing, and avoiding panic. Too much movement, coughing, and panic can increase blood pressure and prevent the wound from healing, so the bleeding cannot stop. Remember: only one or two out of a hundred cases die directly from coughing up blood, so fear is unnecessary. The doctor's first treatment for coughing up blood is to administer sedatives and antitussives, and use a chest bandage to reduce local blood flow and reduce chest movement. The use of hemostatic agents is still controversial. In suitable cases, artificial pneumothorax to stop the bleeding can have miraculous effects. Blood transfusions and surgery are sometimes necessary. In terms of diet, it is best to eat soft or liquid foods when the bleeding is severe, and cold foods are preferable. The patient should not do it himself, but should be fed by family members or nurses.

Finally, the author would like to correct a misconception: that many people believe that sputum with blood streaks is more serious than coughing up large amounts of blood, but in fact, there is no difference in the severity of the condition between tuberculosis patients who cough up blood and those who do not cough up blood. In today's China, where tuberculosis is rampant, we should suspect that anyone who coughs up blood or has blood streaks in their sputum has tuberculosis, unless it is determined after detailed examination that they are not tuberculous. We should keep in mind that tuberculosis is the biggest cause of coughing up blood.

### The War Between Humans and Germs (4)

— Qiao Shumin

Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management" (3) Susceptibility and Resistance

(2) Specific Resistance—Immunity

In addition to the aforementioned ordinary resistance, we can also have a so-called specific resistance to a certain disease in order to resist a certain specific bacterium. For example, if we suffer from typhoid fever, then our body produces a substance that can have a certain antagonistic reaction with typhoid bacilli or their products. This substance that stimulates antagonistic substances is called "antigen." Antigens are colloidal substances, mostly composed of protein components and their haptens, and the antibodies they stimulate are all unique. For example, various antitoxins, agglutinins, precipitins, bacteriophages, anti-aggressins, lysins, cytotoxins, defensins (complement) are all antibodies, and each has its own uniqueness.

(3) Secondary Factors Related to Resistance:

It is impossible to set a normal standard for resistance to infectious diseases, because in each stage of life, in different natural environments, all nutrients, fatigue, and other constantly changing physiological states all affect the ebb and flow of resistance. Let's briefly discuss it:

A. Age

In infancy, the ability of its serum to kill and hemolyze bacteria such as typhoid bacilli, diphtheria bacilli, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus is lower than that of adults. This is sufficient to explain why infants are more susceptible to general pyogenic infections. The antitoxins in infant serum are about the same as those from the mother's body, so they can avoid suffering from some infectious diseases for a while, but these antitoxins contained in infants are all passive and cannot last long. Because the antigen is a colloidal substance, it cannot pass through the placenta and be imported into the infant's body, thus it cannot enable the infant to produce automatic immunity. It is questionable whether colostrum, which is rich in antigens, can produce immunity. Protozoal infectious diseases mostly do not have obvious immunity. Therefore, infants have no less chance of contracting diseases caused by general protozoa.

The proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the blood of newborns is about 70%, but it drops to 36% at six months, and then gradually increases again, rising to 60% at six years old. In addition, the basicity of infant blood is only 70% to 80% of that of adults, which is extremely unfavorable for resisting bacterial infections. The hydrochloric acid in infant gastric juice is also more dilute, which is also unfavorable for resistance.

The various metabolic functions of the elderly are reduced, their resistance is weak, and their susceptibility is high. However, this is a pathological property, while that of infants is a physiological property.

Looking at the mortality rate of each age group in various countries, the highest is newborns, which then decreases with time until about ten years old, reaching the lowest limit. After that, it increases with age, and by the time they are 105 years old, the chance of death has exceeded the chance of survival. It is difficult to generalize about this trend, but we can get a glimpse of the relationship between the rise and fall of resistance and age.

B. Gender

The physiological structures of men and women are different, especially the endocrine functions, which are very different. Researchers who study human lifespan know that the lifespan of women is longer than that of men, because their susceptibility to infectious diseases is lower than that of men. In general, every cell in the body of both men and women has different characteristics.

C. Race

Medical scholars are most likely to discover racial differences in resistance or susceptibility. If we compare the resistance or immunity of various human races to a certain disease, we can also often find considerable differences. However, when studying racial differences, all differences that can be caused by various external factors must be eliminated before it can be said to be a true racial difference. Let's talk about the differences that can be caused by external factors:

D. Nutrition

In years of famine, epidemics are often caused. As the saying goes, "After a great war, there will be a year of famine," which we all know, but we should not rashly say that poor nutrition is the direct cause of the epidemic. Those with poor nutrition do have reduced resistance to various infectious diseases. However, we still have no clear evidence to judge that those with poor nutrition will have increased infection rates. In general, our resistance to acute infectious diseases is mostly unique, and their infection depends on the chance of infection; but for chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and dysentery, nutritional factors are particularly important.

Excessive nutrition can also have a temporary impact on disease resistance. Arnhld observed that the number of bacteria in the intestines of those who consumed too much protein increased greatly, and the permeability of the intestines also increased, causing bacteria to invade the lymph vessels in the intestinal wall.

When vitamins A and C are deficient, the susceptibility to general infectious diseases increases significantly, but taking large amounts of vitamins A and C will not additionally increase their resistance. Regarding the relationship between other vitamins and other nutrients and the rise and fall of resistance, there is currently insufficient information available for judgment.

E. Fatigue

The influence of fatigue factors on resistance is not easy to measure, because at the time of fatigue, there are often hunger, poor appetite, mental depression, or exposure to unsuitable environments, etc. Moreover, fatigue is often a sign of the onset of general infectious diseases, and may not be a direct cause, but fatigue can stimulate latent infections and promote the spread of the disease, which is proven by experiments.

F. Climate

The influence of climate on the rise and fall of resistance seems to be paid attention to by general epidemiologists. However, no one can say exactly what the exact relationship is. Among them, the influence of temperature and humidity is probably greater. Drastic changes in temperature and humidity are sufficient to reduce the resistance of the upper respiratory tract, and the bactericidal power of the gastrointestinal tract also seems to be reduced at the same time, and the permeability of the intestinal wall can also be improved.

Spring and Autumn

### Scottish Poet - Burns

— Shen Liren

250th Anniversary Commemoration

This year marks the 250th anniversary of the death of Robert Burns. This Scottish poet saint, because his works are too rich in local color and musicality, often makes those who admire him feel difficult to translate. Therefore, in China, he is not as familiar to a group of people as other prominent Western poets.

He was a native of Ayrsgire in Scotland, the small village that became famous because of him. In that small village, there is still an ugly thatched cottage, visited by countless travelers in spring and autumn, lingering and sighing near the short walls built of mud and stone. This is what Burns' father built with his own hands, and it is the birthplace of this great poet.

Burns' brother, Robbie, was also a famous poet. Their family had been farmers for generations. Burns only stayed in school for two years. From the age of nine, he began working in the fields. Therefore, in many of the magnificent rhymes he later wrote, we often seem to smell the scent of the soil. His father was a relatively enlightened farmer who hoped his children would receive education. On winter evenings or summer moonlit nights, old Burns often told stories from books to the children; at the same time, the mother taught them to sing various nursery rhymes. Just like many other outstanding writers, their genius was able to be nurtured and developed entirely due to family art.

Because of this, Burns became interested in legends and poetry. Whether he was hurrying to the market or wandering on the fields, or even at mealtime, he often grabbed a small booklet from his pocket and recited it. Gradually, he even learned to write poetry, reading it to his neighbors in his spare time. Everyone praised him happily, saying that his "mountain songs" were very pleasant and fresh.

At the age of twenty-three, his father passed away. His family moved to another piece of land and worked even harder, and his poems became increasingly mature. Once, he accidentally destroyed a field mouse's nest with a hoe. He felt guilty because winter was near and the little animal had no home. He wrote a poem to express his melancholy. Later, he said that from that day on, he decided to become a poet.

He met his future wife, Armour, at the age of twenty-five. At this time, he thought of going to the West Indies to work. He boldly published his first collection of poems. As a result, due to the meager reward, he could only go to Edinburgh. In that city of poets, he was quickly welcomed, quickly stood out, and quickly became famous, and published two more books of poetry.

Friends in Edinburgh introduced him to a job as a border tax collector. His new life made him constantly ride horses, traveling to remote wilderness areas. He often traveled through forests and mountains on dark nights, wearing rain and dew, but his pages of poetry also became thicker and thicker. Later, he fell into depravity. He spent his absurd years in the cellars of hotels with a group of low-class friends. He never stopped wanting to pull himself up, but every time after a long and cold rush, he could only find a trace of warmth and joy under the smoky roof. In the end, he lost his health, which was such a pity for the whole world!

Perhaps because of the abnormality of life or too much understanding of melancholy, any great poet is short-lived. Shelley only lived for thirty years; Keats traveled in the world for twenty-six springs and autumns; even Edgar Allan Poe's singing career was only a little over forty years. When Burns died, he had just passed his thirty-seventh birthday. This short period was full of sorrow and struggle.

Poets seem to have a premonition of death. Although he was only thirty-seven years old, he was aware of the approach of death. One winter night, he was sitting in the hotel with his companions as usual, when he suddenly said; "Friends, I am going to die." His friends all looked at him with strange and bewildered eyes.

He dragged his heavy steps and walked home silently, but he did not reach the door. Halfway, he actually accepted the invitation of the god of death.

### Refugee Notes from Huangyangsi Station

— Shi Mo

The train drove into Huangyangsi—a small station on the Xiang-Gui Railway—and slowly stopped. It was the weather of May or June, and the sun was like a high-hanging fiery umbrella. People climbed down from the top of the train and out of the windows with anxious hearts, and burrowed under the train to cool off with their clothes open. No matter how unfamiliar they were, everyone asked each other cordially, inquiring whether Hengyang had fallen.

The station was a scene of noise and bustle. I was squeezed into the crowd, walking from one end of the stalls to the other, looking for something to eat. My head was a little dizzy from the sun. I looked up at the quiet train, lying there dark and desolate. People climbed up and down his body, walked back and forth.

As time passed, the sun gradually set in the west, and the sky opposite became even more distant and beautiful. After two faint whistles, a wisp of black smoke rose from a farmhouse in the distance. Everyone raised their tired eyes and looked, knowing that another train was dragging ten batches of refugees towards Huangyangsi, thinking in their hearts: "I wonder what is going on in Hengyang?"

I walked to a lonely little hill nearby and sat down, watching the train, emitting black smoke, gradually driving into the station. We suddenly realized that this train had driven onto the same track as the one we were parked on. Everyone immediately raised their arms and shouted. People's voices were like roaring waves, and people's arms were like branches swaying in the wind in the forest, waving in a disorderly manner, but the train, in the heavy sound of machinery, drove over heavily, giving people no time to hesitate, and with a "bang", collided with our carriage.

Suddenly there was silence, like a huge wave in the boundless sea rising against the wind, and then smashing fiercely on the rocks on the shore, followed by a very short period of silence after a crash, followed by a crashing sound of water mixed with the shattered falling sound of rocks, and the cries of the people followed.

The people who were cooling off under the carriages had their arms and legs broken, and the people who were shaken down from the carriages were pressed on top of them. Some fainted, and some had already stopped breathing. A wife was holding her child and looking for her husband. She ran madly through several carriages, and saw at a glance that her husband was lying in a pool of blood. She let out a scream, like a huge hammer heavily hitting her back, and fell forward in response, pressing on the chest of the dead, the child was thrown aside.

Someone walked over from the station with a cane, looked at the luxurious car transported on the train, which was not damaged, glanced casually at the dead and wounded on both sides of the long train, and then walked to the military station with a cane.

The wailing gradually subsided. In the setting sun, the lawn of the station reflected a dim light, and there was only a low sobbing mixed with groaning sounds.

We silently climbed into the car, but the train would not leave that day. I leaned out of the window, and the dark Huangyangsi station was covered with a faint moonlight. At this moment, the sound of a motor engine vaguely came from above, and four silver wings swept across the white clouds at the highest point in the sky. I suddenly turned my head back, and a bright star dragged a long, shiny tail, drawing an arc in the dark sky, and disappeared. A guest next to him murmured:

"I'm afraid Hengyang can't be defended. The enemy has gone to attack the airport in Lingling!"

### Glossary of Art Terms

— Ma Chaoying

People's Art

In German, Volkskunst; in French, Lart du Penplle, "People's Art" has three origins: one comes from the ideas of democracy and socialism, one is to reject decadent middle-class art, and one is for the emerging people. Especially the new art produced by the emerging class, it advocates that so-called true art is to gather the sorrows, desires, and beliefs of the people into the focus of personal life and burn. Romain Rolland is a representative of this kind of proposition.

Mammon Art

Mammonart in English is a kind of tendency to worship money, and art for the sake of gold. In a capitalist social organization, everything, including art, cannot be an exception, and undoubtedly has the possibility of becoming a commodity. The American literary theorist Sinclair Upton has a clear dissection of this point in his very famous book "Mammonart."

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 45

— Ye Jingfeng

Oops! I told No. 04 a few words and hurried to the Road Bureau Power Plant. When I arrived on the road under the mountain ridge, I saw that it was indeed the people from Changxindian Town, carrying and carrying big and small bags, walking towards the factory. When asked, they all said in unison that the Japanese devils were about to attack, and they were preparing to take temporary shelter in the factory.

"Sister-in-law," I met Dingyuan's wife at the entrance of Dingyuan, "what's going on? ... Who told these people to move to the factory? ..."

"I don't know either!" She was very surprised, "Dingyuan is feeling better and hasn't gone to bed yet, please come into the house."

"This is really lively!" Dingyuan was indeed feeling better than in the morning, "Listen, the devil's artillery fire seems to be free."

At this time, the artillery fire was very intense. Every time a shell fell, with a bang, the window frames in the factory rattled. Several children were sitting in the corner of the room, with their eyes wide open and their ears perked up, as if they knew where the shells were falling. The eldest sister, Meijun, was also sitting with her younger siblings, her small hands clenched tightly.

I told Dingyuan that the location of the factory was really not good; if the situation was not right, this factory would be a target for attack. Moreover, the people in the town were all gathering here, which was especially bad.

Dingyuan pondered calmly; I don't know if he was really calm or pretending to be in the style of an English gentleman.

"There is nothing we can do about it," he said slowly, "the factory director is not here, these people in the town, the foremen and managers in the factory, have some relatives and friends. If one comes, we can't refuse the second one, don't you think so? As for what benefits there are after coming, maybe no one can say. ..."

I asked him if he had any intention of moving out. He said that it was actually impossible to do so; there was nowhere to go, and moving back and forth wouldn't get them out of Changxindian, unless he joined the army immediately. He hoped to recover soon and join the army as soon as possible. I saw that after talking back and forth, there was no concrete solution, so I had to end the conversation.

Meijun sent me to the door, following closely behind me. I told her not to be polite, to go back to take care of her father and take care of her younger siblings. She just walked silently behind me, as if she hadn't heard what I said. After walking a few steps, I felt strange, because she usually didn't act this way. Seeing that we were almost at the main road of the factory gate, I stopped and asked her if she had anything to say?

Under the hazy starlight and moonlight, she was wearing a light blue homespun dress. Her slender figure seemed to sway and flutter with the breeze. Her well-proportioned silhouette, set off by the blurry trees and branches and the faint moonlight, was very charming, though fleeting.

"Uncle!" Her voice was so soft that it couldn't be softer, but it was very clear, "If you have time, ..." Boom! Another shell fell and exploded not far away, shaking her, and the glass on the factory doors and windows echoed with a bang, drowning out the second half of her sentence.

"If I have time, of course, I'll come to see you often..." I guessed what she wanted to say, comforting her...

"I... I'm afraid!" She lowered her head, her voice a little choked up.

"Afraid of what... child?" I wanted to strengthen her courage, but then I thought that this sentence was not reasonable. She, a girl who was only seventeen years old, was trapped in such a terrible environment, her father was sick in bed, and the family was full of women and children. It was impossible not to be afraid. "Fear is also useless." I had no choice but to comfort her with irrelevant words, urging her to take care of her younger siblings and go to bed early, and promising to come early tomorrow morning to discuss a solution with her father.

### Decay

— Shao Fu

It is said that the military strategist Yang Jie is now living a reclusive life on the south bank of Chongqing. He has converted to Tantric Buddhism, discusses Zen and debates Xuan, rarely appears in public places, rarely crosses the river once every one or two months, and even has very few visitors.

I was reminded of what Romain Rolland said in his preface to his "Life of Beethoven" in 1903. He said:

"Life is hard. For those who are not content with mediocrity, it is a struggle without end, often tragic, without glory, without happiness, a struggle unfolding in loneliness and silence."

Why is this rare military genius living in seclusion? We cannot superficially believe that his conversion to Tantric Buddhism is the silent decay of his life's talent. He is cultivating (not just religiously), he is struggling, and he is also waiting! Because someone like him is not willing to wither in any way.

But the struggle in loneliness and silence is hard.

Many geniuses are decaying without a sound. Mr. Yang Gengguang's recent life cannot but make people worry.

### Jeep, we beg you for mercy!

— Teng

The big guys who drive Jeeps, the old masters who sit in Jeeps, the adults and gentlemen who are in charge of Jeeps, I kneel down and ask you as I pray to God: when the car is running on the road, slow down a little, and don't treat people's lives as less than dog shit, charging around and playing around. If you want to show off, it's enough to drive or sit in a Jeep. Why be so irrational? The day before yesterday (the 21st), an old worker, Chen Yusheng, was riding his bicycle home for dinner. When he walked near the Xiaocai Field on Liaoyang Road, he was hit from behind by a Jeep accelerating. The car was damaged (bicycle) and the person was injured with a broken leg. The Jeep then fled the scene and disappeared. Now Chen Yusheng is sleeping in the Shanghai East Hospital, suffering immensely. Imagine that it is like this in crowded places, and the rest can be imagined. It is said that most people who drive Jeeps use their hats and clothes as permits, and their driving skills can be imagined. Why do ordinary cars have fewer accidents, and Jeeps always have accidents? This responsibility lies with the traffic management authorities. First, they must drive at the speed specified in the regulations. Exceeding the speed should be absolutely punished, no matter how big the background is! Second, check their licenses when you see Jeeps. I think it will have some effect. I remember the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chief Inspector of Traffic, Bu Lingfei Er, his car number was Nine, and when he was walking between Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, a patrolman failed to stop the car in time, so he punished the patrolman for the fault of not stopping. He accepted it in the same way. The spirit of foreign service rules is really admirable! In fact, this is a trivial matter in foreign countries, it is a duty. Unexpectedly, this is rare in China. Big guys, old masters, adults and gentlemen who have Jeeps! Slow down the speed of the car! So as not to cause poor disasters! Don't think you can run rampant in the world, maybe you will run into a stronger ten-wheeled Jeep, then you will not get that advantage!

### Beware of Temptation

— You Juan

Last week, Mr. Renren Yu went to a movie theater alone to watch a movie. Just as he was engrossed in the movie, a woman next to him nudged him with her arm and said:

"It's so cold today!"

He didn't say anything, just nodded to the woman. After a while, the woman said again?

"The air conditioning is turned on too high, touch my hand and see how cold it is!"

While saying this, she stretched out a hand and placed it on Mr. Yu's hand. Because Mr. Yu did not push her hand away, she went further and stretched out the other hand as well, and leaned her body on Mr. Yu's body, saying:

"I feel a little uncomfortable, let me lean on you for a while!"

The woman was dressed very fashionably and looked very beautiful. Mr. Yu did not refuse and let her lean on him, using his hand as a hot water bottle for her to warm her hands. When it was almost time for the show to end, the woman said softly to him:

"I drank soda today, I need to go to the toilet. After the show is over, can you come to the entrance of the women's toilet to find me?"

After the show was over, he went to the entrance of the toilet to wait. He waited for a long time and didn't see the woman come out. He became a little impatient and raised his hand to look at his watch; who knew that the watch on his wrist was gone. Looking again, the ring on his finger was also gone. After a moment of stunnedness, he suddenly realized. It turned out that the woman had stolen the watch and ring while "warming her hands." At that time, he had to admire the woman's superb stealing skills, and he had to blame himself for not being able to resist the temptation of women at all, and for being so ignorant and unconscious that he didn't even know that his watch and ring had been taken off. Who else could he blame besides himself? He could only admit that he was unlucky. So he learned a lesson from his loss, and he said that he would never go to the Chang again in the future!

Dear readers: Beware! This is Shanghai!

### Children and Women's Spiritual Hunger How to Improve Serial Picture Books

— He Liping

The "serial picture book" issue has been discussed by people long ago. It is not necessary to say more about the bad influence she has on children and even adult women. I recently walked on Minguo Road and saw a small shop, the inside of which was filled with dense serial picture books. At night, the electric lights were bright, and many women and children sat on low stools and read attentively, like a small library.

Precisely because the content of serial picture books is nothing more than adultery, theft and gods and monsters, the people who read them unknowingly fill their heads with strange things, and these strange things will take effect at a certain period, (that is, they are poisoned by serial picture books,) for example, the past children's people's mountain seeking immortals and this time the Beijing Road blood case are all reactions after being poisoned.

But if we look deeper, people have been calling for banning serial picture books long before the Anti-Japanese War. Why can't it be realized? It's not that the Ministry of Interior has any permits that can't be prohibited; but in reality, it is because it has a large number of readers, and children and women have become lovers and supporters of serial picture books. Although their knowledge is shallow, they also need spiritual food, but our literary artists have forgotten them, and the difficult and Europeanized words strung together are like heavenly books, which cannot be understood by their intellectual level. I am not advocating the current serial picture books, but saying: although the current serial picture books are undesirable, once they are banned, where are the children's and women's readings? Our literary artists should lower their heads and look at these large numbers of women and children who are thirsty for spiritual food, use the form of serial picture books to inject scientific common sense, anti-Japanese heroic stories, historical celebrities' struggle history, ... inject these brand-new themes, so that serial picture books become educational textbooks that guide children and women to the bright road.

The form of serial picture books itself is not guilty, what is guilty is the content of adultery, theft, gods and monsters loaded through the form of serial picture books; we may as well turn around and put new wine in old bottles, using the old form of serial picture books to load the new content of scientific morality and art. This makes it easier to win over the children and women who love serial picture books. In order to save the women and children who are poisoned by serial picture books, in addition to passive banning, I more actively call on cultural people to pay attention to the issue, take action to serve the people, and create new serial picture books with flesh and blood!

Interesting Anecdotes

### American Gimmicks

— Xu Jingfu

Small Restaurants

In major cities in the United States, such as New York and Chicago, there are many small restaurants, named Speakeasy, which are inexpensive and convenient for men and women to have private conversations. There are many restaurants in Shanghai, but the prices are expensive, and most small restaurants are simply equipped, and even have inches of dirt, which makes people flinch. If they can be improved, they may be able to do more business for lovers.

Novelty

After a writer finishes writing a book, he spares no effort to find the perfect title. Americans admire novelty, and the titles of books are often colloquial, such as "Not too shallow, not too deep," "Only oysters have pearls," "Your child and mine." Some use bizarre words to show off, such as "The young man with horns" and "The Black-Eyed Woman's Strange Case." Some also use more cautious words, such as "After-dinner stories," "Borderland Beacon Fire," "Peace General," and "Wings of Terror." The best is a writer named Ruth Ludwig Gault. He wrote a novel called "I Love You, I Love You, I Love You!"

Satire

American theater critics are harsh in their criticism of unsatisfactory dramas. For example, the so-called smartest critic, the late Percy Hammond, after watching a performance by a dance troupe, called the owner of the troupe: "It seems that he forgot that a woman's knee is a physical joint, not an evening entertainment."

Another critic said of a play, "The scenery is beautiful, but the actors are blocking my view." He went to the extreme of sarcasm. Similar to this, there is also a mean theater review that said, "The play was performed very well, but the seats were too bad, facing the front of the stage."

### Utter Selfishness

— Suo

"Keep order, keep order!" People who hope to improve Shanghai's traffic are shouting this, and have shouted it many times. After September 9th, how much determination did the government make, how much energy did the traffic police put in, how much hope did the pedestrians put in, everyone was trying to make Shanghai like a qualified city, and also for the safety of the people themselves, but I don't know what kind of inferiority makes this group of people who don't abide by the rules lose their humanity, the cars always refuse to follow one after another, everyone is messing around; the atomic tigers (Jeeps) have no one in their eyes and treat human lives as if they were nothing. I don't know when they can be made to show their conscience and admit that everyone has the minimum right to survive. It is said that on the 21st, an atomic tiger injured a worker on Liaoyang Road, and he was so insane that he was irresponsible and lost all his sympathetic nature, and fled the scene. If this driver still has a trace of humanity left, he should hate his utter selfishness, extreme ruthlessness, and lack of humanity at the time, and ask the competent police station to punish him and personally apologize to the injured and compensate for medical expenses. Only in this way can he be a bright and upright Chinese citizen! The driver who caused the accident and escaped: we are looking forward to your brave and frank behavior!

### Veteran Diplomat: Wang Zhengting

— Zheng Fan

An Eloquent and Adaptable Statesman

Dr. Wang Zhengting, who recently returned from the Philippines, is a name familiar to many. He is a veteran in Chinese diplomatic circles and is known for his eloquence. One only needs to see the grand pronouncements he made to reporters after returning from the Philippines (see this newspaper on the 18th) to witness his vibrant oratory.

Mr. Wang is from Fenghua, Zhejiang, and is a fellow townsman of Chairman Chiang. The two were very close in their youth. He was born on July 25th of the eighth year of the Guangxu reign, five years older than Chairman Chiang. In Chairman Chiang's personal diaries, he often mentions "Yirutang" (Wang's alias). In the letters Chairman Chiang sent to Chiang Ching-kuo and Chiang Wei-kuo, he often mentioned "Uncle Wang."

Old Revolutionary

Wang joined the revolution very early. While studying in Tokyo, he was personally introduced by the Founding Father and joined the Tongmenghui. Later, he went to the United States for further studies and became acquainted with many revolutionary martyrs. In the third year of the Xuantong reign, he returned to China with a Master of Arts degree from Yale University. It was the time of the Wuchang Uprising, and he followed Li Huangpi, serving as the Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs for the Hubei Military Government. Since then, he has been engaged in political life, and the positions he has held include:

Vice Minister and Acting Minister of Industry and Commerce, Vice Speaker of the Senate, Plenipotentiary Representative to the Paris Peace Conference, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Chairman of the Customs Conference, Director-General of the Sino-Russian Conference, Director-General of the Longhai Railway, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Ambassador to the United States, ...... and is now elected as one of the city's councilors.

Arguing Diplomacy

It is difficult to argue diplomacy, and it is even more difficult to handle diplomacy for a weak country. Wang took office as Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time when the Japanese invaders launched the Changhua Offensive; the Wanbaoshan Incident was not yet resolved, and the three northeastern provinces were suddenly and forcibly occupied. At that time, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was truly "enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens," but there were many misunderstandings from the outside world, and Wang almost became the target of public criticism. Therefore, on September 28th of the twentieth year of the Republic (ten days after the September 18th Incident), more than 1,700 students from Central University poured into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wang was actually beaten, causing a national sensation.

Wang is the foremost person in China to handle diplomacy. When the revolutionary government was formally established, representatives from twelve provinces gathered in Wuchang and held a meeting in the Changyang Company in the British Concession of Hankou. At that time, Wang was working in the Hubei Military Government, and because he was relatively familiar with foreigners, it was agreed to ask Wang to handle foreign affairs and constitutional drafting. Constitutional drafting for foreign affairs was unprecedented in China, with no established rules to follow, only learning from the United States. It is said that Wang initially relied heavily on "Principles of International Law" by Lawrence when handling foreign affairs, and this book was borrowed from an American missionary. The constitutional drafting at that time was also based on the American Constitution, but unexpectedly, the chapter on "Rights and Obligations" was missing. It turned out that the constitution formulated after the American independence was missing this chapter, which was later added in the final amendments. Wang and the other two constitutional drafting representatives—Lei Fen and Ma Junwu—did not have time to choose carefully due to the urgency of the situation. It is also a story.

Wang has been in politics for thirty-five years now, and his spirit and his eloquence particularly show his rich experience and insights.

### Autumn Sounds

From Mr. Shi to Aunt Shi, old and young, rich and poor, a total of eight people, making up two tables, playing mahjong every night until midnight, the whole family is living in the "west" and "wind." As for me, wearing a tattered old pair of trousers, torn in the front and back, beyond repair, I cannot talk about "winter clothes not yet tailored in September" because I have not seen a tailor for several years. Alas!
