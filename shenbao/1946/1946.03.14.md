### Soviet Troops Blockade Lushun and Dalian; Install German Heavy Artillery

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Chongqing News: Dong Yanping, the head of our military delegation stationed in the Northeast, proposed to the Soviet side to use the port of Dalian to transport relief supplies to save refugees in the Northeast, but was not agreed to. According to recent reports from the Northeast: Lushun and Dalian have been blockaded by Soviet troops, becoming forbidden areas. The Soviet army has re-modified the Dalian fortress construction plan before the Russo-Japanese War. There were two original artillery forts on Taishan Island in Dalian Bay and Zhong Sanshan Island, both of which were independent fortresses. During the Japanese control period, each fortress was equipped with about six artillery pieces. After the Soviet army returned to Dalian, they brought dozens of artillery pieces captured in Germany and deployed them in the fortress artillery positions. They also plan to add independent fortresses on Nan Sanshan Island, which was originally undefended, and add artillery positions. Soviet troops are working to strengthen the port operations in Dalian. The Soviet side is carefully studying all the plans that the South Manchuria Railway Company had not completed in the past, and is paying special attention to the vertical and horizontal relationship between Dalian port and South Manchuria Railway transportation in the past. Currently, the Soviet army is very busy in Dalian, so it refuses to allow visits. Once the arrangement is completed, this best free port in the East, symbolizing freedom and peace, will be able to meet people again.

"Wang Mansion" Interior: A Special Report from Our Nanjing Correspondent, Shen Shi
Record of a Discussion with the Children of Traitors (Part 2)
When asked about their living situation, they said they had no money and dared not sell anything. However, they also mentioned that the family, including an old servant, spent "1,400 yuan" per day on groceries and that they still prepared "quite substantial dishes" to take to prison every Wednesday. When asked where the money came from, they said that she taught during the day and collaborated with her sister-in-law and Chu Menghuan to make embroidered pillowcases for sale. Seeing the pile of new pillowcases and a sewing machine in the room, it might be true. But who could believe that they were self-reliant? "We only sell them for 5,600 yuan, and they resell them for 9,000 yuan," Wang's daughter seemed to complain about the exploitation by merchants. This is one time, and that is another. Wasn't he exploiting tens of millions of people back then? Seeing us off at the door, she even insisted that the "Chevrolet" we were in was her family's old car, which made us boys quite puzzled.

A Large Leopard Skin in Front of the Bed
Turning the corner at Chibi Road is Yihe Road, and the new Chinese-American flag is already fluttering over number 34. This "Chairman's Residence" has now been converted into an officers' club for the U.S. military by the War Zone Service Corps of the Military Affairs Commission. It is a large three-story Western-style house. The lower level is the reception room and offices, the second level has four foreign bedrooms and a large reception room in the middle, and the third floor is said to have been converted into a kindergarten, which is probably the real "Little Wang Family Class." The design is quite beautiful, and the furnishings inside are naturally beyond words, but compared with the "New Residence" at number 18 Xikang Road nearby, it is like a small witch compared to a great one. Number 34 Yihe Road was originally the private residence of the traitor Chu Minyi before the war, given to Wang as a show of servility. Number 18 Xikang Road, on the other hand, is said to have been "built with funds from my mother (referring to Chen Bijun) and subsidies from the national treasury." Wang was known for being henpecked, but unfortunately, Chen Bijun's final "ability to assist her husband" was not enjoyed by Wang, who died before the house was completed.

Number 18 Xikang Road is much more impressive. Upon entering, there is a spacious courtyard, with a large three-story building standing in the center at the back. Corridors rise and fall on both sides, winding and extending in a scattered and well-organized manner. To the left is a small, separate building, said to be a reading room. To the right is a stone platform with a fountain. The main building has large halls on both the upper and lower levels, including reception rooms and offices of various sizes. The carpets and furniture inside are all of the highest quality, and the many large oil paintings hanging on the walls are also the works of famous artists and reproductions of world-famous paintings, truly deserving of the words "magnificent and luxurious."

Unexpectedly, "a winding path leads to a secluded spot, where flowers and trees grow deep in the meditation room." After guiding us through this large building, the guide led us back to the courtyard, climbed onto the fountain stone platform, and turned a small bend, and the view suddenly opened up, revealing another world. It turned out that there was another large courtyard and a right-angled building here. The gate leads to Gulin Temple, with the address number 17. Upon entering, it is small and exquisite, originally a bathroom with a rattan seat, clearly painstakingly designed. Ancient trees reach the sky, and the hills rise and fall. A new swimming pool made of concrete lies in the southwest corner, forming a stark contrast to the magnificent building across the wall, truly a perfect place for leisurely living. It is said that Chen Gongbo once lived here for a few days, and there is still a large bed in front of which a large leopard skin is laid, making one imagine the splendor of the time.

Among the large and small traitors in Nanjing who own real estate, a total of 104 properties have been seized, of course, these two are the best. Now that number 34 Yihe Road has been enjoyed by the Allied forces, number 18 Xikang Road and number 17 Gulin Temple are said to be used as the Chairman's Residence after the capital is returned. Some time ago, it was rumored that Chairman Chiang was unwilling to use the house that Wang had lived in as his official residence. Later, after people explained that Wang had never set foot in this house, Madame Chiang inspected it for a week during her last visit to Nanjing. From all indications, it is likely to be the Chairman's Residence in the future.

(March 11) Central Supervisory Committee Passes Proposal Urging Swift and Severe Punishment of Traitors
[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] The second plenary session of the Sixth Central Supervisory Committee was held at 3 p.m. today in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. Seventy-one members of the Central Supervisory Committee and twenty-four alternate members attended. Zhang Ji presided over the meeting. Many proposals were discussed at the meeting, including the case of the Seizing Government transferring instructions to relevant agencies to quickly and severely punish traitors, which was discussed extremely intensively. Five measures were subsequently passed: (1) The traitors who have already been arrested in various places should have their trial personnel increased immediately, and the trial should be conducted openly and quickly. (2) Traitors who have served as specially appointed officials or mayors of provinces or cities in the puppet government should be ordered by the government to be sent to the courts for prompt and public trial and severely punished. (3) Traitors who have not been arrested should be strictly ordered to relevant agencies to promptly report and arrest them, so as not to allow them to remain at large. (4) Those who have been arrested but not transferred to the court for investigation should be transferred promptly in accordance with the provisions of the Habeas Corpus Act in order to unify authority and avoid delays. (5) Traitors who surrender after August 10, 1945, shall not be subject to the leniency or exemption from punishment for surrender. Article 6 of the Regulations on the Handling of Traitor Cases already stipulates that execution should be carried out carefully and prudently, without any leniency. Other important cases were then discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m.

Government to Undergo Partial Reorganization, Sun Fo, Zhang Qun, et al. Rumored to Head the Executive Yuan, Xiong Shihui Summoned to Chongqing to Attend Reporting
[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th] The Second Plenary Session is scheduled to close on the 15th, with little time remaining. All parties are focused on the selection of personnel for the government and provincial departments to be reorganized. Regarding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, it is rumored that one of Sun Fo, Zhang Qun, and Wang Chonghui will be selected to succeed. Recently, the rumor of Zhang Zhizhong succeeding has been very strong. However, it is rumored that Mr. Zhang will still fly to the Northwest for official business in the near future. In other departments, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, there are also rumors of transfers. Regarding the Party headquarters, Zhang Daofan is rumored to be the most likely candidate for Secretary-General. Other rumors include Yu Jingtang as the head of the Organization Department and Pan Gongzhan and Xu Xiaoyan as the heads of the Propaganda Department. Chen Lifu may be transferred to head the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th] Since Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan was subjected to severe questioning at the Plenary Session, he once announced his absence. After attending and giving a political report, the atmosphere in the meeting did not improve. It is rumored that Mr. Song has been quite negative in recent days, but has not yet submitted his resignation.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th] At the beginning of the Second Plenary Session, some Central Committee members were quite enthusiastic about the reform movement. Liang Han Cao and others initiated a reform forum and proposed four points of political views, which were quite sympathetic to the actual demands of many Central Committee members. However, in recent days, as the closing date is approaching, the main participants have been busy preparing for the elections of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, the National Government Committee, and the National Assembly representatives. Therefore, the reform atmosphere in the meeting is not as intense as in the previous days.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Except for the Border Affairs Report Review Committee, which must continue to meet once on the 14th to discuss, all review committees of the Second Plenary Session will complete their review on the 13th and submit their reports. At the general meeting on the morning of the 14th, Liu Fei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Northeast Economic Commission, will respectively report on the military and economic takeover of the Northeast. The afternoon will be a discussion meeting. It is also reported that Chief Fu Zuoyi flew to Chongqing on the 12th and will attend the general meeting of the Second Plenary Session on the 14th.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th] The Northeast Chongqing Fellow Association expressed deep regret that the Second Plenary Session did not include the takeover issue in the general meeting agenda. The Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang Reconstruction Promotion Association, the Northeast Construction Association, the Northeast Vanguard Society, the Northeast Refugee Relief Committee, and the Northeast Mass Return and Relief Committee jointly elected 44 representatives to petition the Second Plenary Session at the auditorium of the Military Affairs Commission at 10 a.m. this morning. They requested that the Northeast takeover issue be publicly reported and thoroughly reviewed. They also asked the Central Committee members from the Northeast who were attending the meeting to firmly advocate that if their request was not adopted, all Central Committee members from the Northeast should withdraw from the meeting. In addition, students from the Northeast schools in the Shapingba district also paid close attention to this issue. If the meeting did not address it, they would also march to the meeting to petition. Another report: The Central Government urgently notified Mr. Neng Shihui a few days ago to fly to Chongqing to report on the takeover of the Northeast at the Plenary Session on the 14th.

Soviet Troops Moving Steadily Towards Tehran, U.S.-Soviet Relations Increasingly Tense, Washington Issues Urgent Note Seeking Explanation from Soviets, Britain Also Demands Explanation of Troop Presence
[This Newspaper Report] London, 13th Broadcasting states: Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ala, stated today that Soviet pressure on Turkey has exceeded the stage of psychological warfare, and he expects that war will break out on the Turkish border soon.

[This Newspaper Report] London, 13th Broadcasting: Iranian Prime Minister Sadr said today that he has not received confirmed news of the U.S. State Department's report of frequent Soviet troop movements in Iran. The issues he discussed in Moscow were two: (1) Soviet withdrawal from Iran, (2) the Azerbaijan issue, neither of which reached an agreement. Whether Iran will submit this issue to the Security Council is currently undecided, but the new Soviet Ambassador to Iran will arrive in Tehran soon, at which time Soviet-Iranian negotiations can be reopened. Currently, the Azerbaijan issue is secondary, and the most important issue is still the withdrawal of Soviet troops, because elections cannot be held as long as Soviet troops remain. According to Iranian law, elections cannot be held before foreign troops withdraw. The Iranian Prime Minister stated that Iran can accept certain conditions, but Soviet troops must withdraw.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] According to intelligence obtained by the U.S. State Department, there have recently been movements of Soviet troops and heavy weapons from the Soviet border towards Tehran via Tabriz. A State Department spokesperson also revealed that the United States has asked Moscow whether these movements are indeed taking place, and if so, what the reasons are.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Since news broke that the Soviet Union not only did not withdraw troops stationed in Iran but also reinforced them with armored vehicles and cavalry, already tense U.S.-Soviet relations have entered a more serious crisis. After receiving reports that the Soviet Union was moving troops and heavy weapons towards Tehran and the western border of Iran, the United States sent an urgent note to the Soviet Union, demanding an explanation. U.S. officials in Washington openly declared that the situation has become serious, believing that it threatens peace. They expressed concern about the reported movement of three columns of Soviet combat troops towards the Middle East, where the situation is already extremely tense, believing that it not only threatens Iran but also Turkey and Iraq. They believe that the greatest crisis is that before the Security Council can deal with the Soviet Union's refusal to withdraw its troops from Iran, the Soviet Union's "psychological warfare" may turn into actual action.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The United States' second note to the Soviet Union regarding the Iran issue was apparently submitted after learning of the Soviet troop movements a few days ago. Washington believes that these Soviet troop movements have the following three possibilities: first, to force Iran to form a pro-Soviet government to consolidate its border strategic zone; second, to put pressure on Turkey to obtain rights to the Dardanelles Strait; and third, to attempt to gain a foothold in British-controlled hopes. According to estimates by the United States and Britain, Soviet troops stationed in Iran on February 2 numbered approximately 70,000 to 75,000.

[Associated Press, London, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said today that the British government has received reports that "large units" of Soviet troops are moving from Tabriz towards both Tehran, the capital of Iran, and the Iraqi border. The British government "attaches importance" to the troop movements, not as much as to the continued presence of Soviet troops in Iran.

[Another Cable] British Foreign Secretary Bevin has instructed the British Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow to notify the Soviet government that the British government strongly urges the Soviet side to immediately explain the reasons for the continued presence of Soviet troops in Iran. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that regarding the situation in Iran, British Prime Minister Attlee and U.S. President Truman have not had direct contact, nor have they formally proposed that a summit of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union be held sooner rather than later, because the situation in Iran may require it.

[Associated Press, Tehran, 12th] After the dissolution of the Iranian Parliament, there is no longer a legislative body, and Prime Minister Sadr has become a dictator. During the last meeting today, the attending members of parliament kept the meeting situation a secret, but it was reported that the Prime Minister reported on his meeting with the Soviet side in Moscow.

UNRRA Director Lehman Resigns

Soviet Union Demands Land Allocation, Austria Firmly Rejects
[Central News Agency, Vienna, 11th, United Press] The Soviet Union has demanded 67,000 acres of Austrian land to be used for the production of vegetables, milk, and meat to supply the needs of the Soviet occupation forces. Austria strongly protested against this. The Soviet Union then agreed to reduce the originally requested acreage by one-third, but Austria still expressed strong protests. Some sources believe that this protest will receive the approval of Western powers. It is said that Austria's memorandum to the Soviet Union is the strongest of the memoranda to the occupying countries.

The content of this new note has not been released, but according to informed sources, the wording is based on the Yalta and Potsdam Declarations, advocating assisting the oppressed nations of Europe to achieve democratic governments. To achieve this goal, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France should implement an economic blockade against Spain and sever diplomatic relations.

Stalin Says New Five-Year Plan Is About to Be Implemented
[TASS, Moscow, 13th] The first meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was inaugurated in the Kremlin Hall yesterday, and Stalin also attended. The Federal Council met at 5 p.m., and the National Council met at 8 p.m. The first meeting of the Supreme Soviet was chaired by the old senior Soviet representative, academician, Baikoff. As a result, General Andrei Stanov was unanimously elected as the Chairman of the Federal Council. Drofin Lysenko and Neiltas Endasinov were vice chairmen.

The Federal Council has decided to accept the following agenda in order to hold a joint meeting with the National Council: (1) Election of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, (2) Composition of the Soviet government—the People's Committee, (3) Election of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, (4) Appointment of the State Prosecutor of the Soviet Union.

When the Federal Council and the National Council hold a joint meeting, they will read a report on the five-year plan for the restoration and development of the Soviet Union's economy from 1946 to 1950.

The Credentials Committee has been elected, consisting of 14 people, with Nikolai Batorichev as chairman. The committee specializes in reviewing the powers of representatives of the Federal Council.

The next meeting of the Federal Council will be held on the 14th of this month.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 13th] The Supreme Soviet (Parliament) of the Soviet Union convened last night. When Marshal Stalin attended, the party cheered for five minutes before stopping. Stalin said in his speech that the new five-year plan is about to be implemented. Councilor Vekov first spoke, saying that the Soviet Union has occupied a seat in the ranks of the world powers. (According to a Moscow radio report received in London, Vekov's speech said that the Soviet Union's safety depends entirely on force, so the strength of the Red Army must be strengthened.) After the Supreme Soviet passed the eight-point agenda, the two houses adjourned and will continue to meet tomorrow.

Ignoring Allied Regulations, Soviet Union Immigrates to Japan
[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] It is learned that according to the current regulations stipulated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the restrictions on Americans immigrating to Japan are stricter than those of other United Nations people. The Soviet Union is using this point to immigrate Soviet people to Japan without the approval of the Allied Command. Although MacArthur has issued a statement that American families must wait until May 1 to come here, some Soviet families have already immigrated to Japan.

Opening of International Bank Still Pending, Countries Applying for Loans, Soviet Union Still Adopting Waiting Attitude, Waiting for Opportunity to Obtain Maximum Benefits
[Central News Agency, New York, 12th Special Telegram] It is reported that although the opening of the World Bank is still pending, representatives of various countries attending the World Bank and Monetary Fund meeting have already made loan requests. According to the Bretton Woods Agreement, the bank's funds, including the funds to be contributed by the Soviet Union, total $9.1 billion. Since the Soviet Union has not approved the Bretton Woods Agreement, the funds contributed by the 34 member countries participating in the bank total only $7.6 billion. It is reported that China has emphasized that the funds required to develop its transportation system are huge, so the number of bank loans to China will be very large, but a specific number has not yet been proposed. Britain is currently most concerned about the unified loan of $3.75 billion negotiated in South America. France strongly advocates that the previously occupied countries should have priority in obtaining loans. France intends to borrow $100 million from the bank as soon as possible. Many small countries are also trying to request loans, and the amount they intend to borrow ranges from $100 million to $500 million. It should be noted that the application can only be submitted after the organizational meeting is completed and the date when the bank officially starts operating is determined. The election of the bank president and the general manager of the fund may be postponed until after the meeting is over.

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th Special Telegram] The Soviet Union has now broken its silence on international monetary cooperation. Bystrov, the head of the Soviet delegation to the Savannah Conference, told the press today that he did not know whether the Soviet Union would participate in the World Bank and the Monetary Fund before the meeting closed in the next two weeks. He declined to explain whether the fund and the bank would give the Soviet Union any benefits. He said that Moscow was still studying the Bretton Woods Agreement. When asked why the Soviet Union needed more consideration time than other major countries, Bell responded that this issue was more complicated for the Soviet Union than for other countries. The Soviet Union's position on Bretton Woods is still the subject of general speculation. Recent observations believe that the Soviet Union will eventually participate in international monetary cooperation, but Moscow's true reason for its current indifference seems to belong to the economic and financial aspects. The Soviet Union may be willing to use its final participation in international monetary cooperation to exchange for maximum benefits. According to the current situation, the Soviet Union may achieve its wish by delaying the decision until the US Congress passes the loan to Britain. If the loan to Britain is approved, the Soviet Union may conduct bargain negotiations with the United States and Britain. If the loan to Britain is not approved, the Soviet Union may be willing to exchange its participation in the international monetary agreement for US loans or credit borrowings and obtain huge benefits. However, international trade has not yet recovered, so Moscow can calmly wait and see.

One of Four Vice Presidents from Our Country

Editorial: Soviet Troops Withdraw from Shenyang
The situation in the Northeast, and regarding the situation in the Northeast, has recently had some new developments that have a somewhat dramatic meaning. The withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed in Shenyang, the partial takeover by the National Army, the gathering of the Communist Army in the suburbs, the rumor of General Zhu De's sudden arrival in Fushun, the recall of General Marshall to the United States, the British government's letter to the Soviet government regarding the Northeast situation, and the arrival of the U.S. Consul-General in office all indicate that the Northeast situation is evolving. We do not need to predict how this situation will evolve. This will be proven by future facts. In any case, evolution is always stronger than silence and stalemate. Of course, the direction of evolution also has two sides.

The Soviet troops' withdrawal from Shenyang, according to this newspaper's fear of spring telegraph on the 11th, will be completed on the 12th. Trotsenko, the Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army, also formally notified Mr. Yan Ping, the representative of our Northeast Headquarters stationed there, that our army was able to take over Shenyang, so it began to withdraw on the 7th, and will be completely withdrawn on the 12th. If the news is true, the Soviet army's resolute withdrawal from Shenyang this time, handing it over to our army, will allow our national army to set foot on this land again fifteen years after the "September 18th" incident, which is naturally extremely gratifying for the Chinese people. However, after the evolution of the Northeast situation in the past few months, the Chinese people's mood, undeniably, still cannot but have considerable reservations in the midst of joy. Perhaps the Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang this time was a bit too sudden, and some people may still feel a little surprised. But we should look at this action of the Soviet army from the bright side, and regard it as an expression of the Soviet government's respect for the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, and the sorrow and anger aroused by the national Northeast situation may be temporarily quieted.

This may be a coincidence, that the Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang is just before General Marshall's recall to the United States. Whether General Marshall's return to the United States will report or discuss the Northeast situation, we do not need to speculate. However, the Soviet army's preparation to withdraw from Shenyang has somewhat changed the current Northeast situation. According to the current information, the trend of this change is to turn it into a purely internal Chinese problem, so that the Soviet Union can get rid of the responsibility it bears. This hides danger. According to Jin Zhongshe's telegraph from Beiping on the 11th: The Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang is nearing completion, and 50,000 Communist troops have begun to gather outside the city. It seems that the struggle between the National and Communist armies is inevitable. According to reliable news from Shenyang, there are still 40,000 Communist troops rushing to Shenyang from various parts of the Northeast. According to the report obtained here later, the Soviet army will complete its withdrawal tomorrow night, leaving only a large railway guard to maintain the transportation line. According to reliable news, the Communist army, under the command of General Zhu De, is preparing to fight in Shenyang. According to Reuters's telegraph from Chongqing on the 12th: Northeast observers predicted today that a considerable large-scale conflict between the National and Communist armies to seize Shenyang is likely to occur within a few days. Reuters's telegraph from Chongqing on the 12th: A Chinese semi-official source in Harbin said that more than 10,000 Chinese Communist troops have arrived in Lalin, ten miles away from Harbin, and will occupy Harbin when the Soviet army withdraws.

From the above reports, it can be seen that the Chinese Communist army is trying to use the Soviet army's sudden withdrawal to expand its power, and then clash with the National Army, turning this Northeast issue, which was originally related to international relations, into a Chinese internal affairs issue. Such a transformation will hinder the intervention of the United States and other powers. The sinister intentions of this are self-evident. We are inspired by the Soviet army's fulfillment of treaty obligations. The Chinese people are extremely willing to live in peace with our great neighbor. The Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang is another expression of friendship between the Soviet Union and the United States, and we cherish this friendship very much. However, the Communist army's conspiracy to harm the country and its attempt to turn this international issue into an internal affair issue will surely be abandoned by the Chinese people. We must urge the Allied powers to be vigilant so that the authenticity of the Northeast situation will not be obscured by the activities of the Communist Party.

Senate Passes Bill for US Ships to be Transferred to Our Country
Proposal to Pay Equivalent Price Rejected, Our Naval Personnel Will Sail Ships Back Home
[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] The House of Representatives today passed a bill by a vote of 313 to 32, authorizing President Truman to transfer 270 small warships to China. The case is now before the Senate for discussion. Under this bill, the President may sell, lease, or donate warships of the same size or smaller than escort destroyers to China to serve as the core of building China's new navy.

[Also, the 13th] Regarding the US transfer of small warships to China, a congressman proposed that China should pay a considerable amount of money. The House of Representatives rejected it by a vote of 78 to 13.

[US News Washington, 12th] The US Navy Department said yesterday that the training of Chinese naval personnel in Guantanamo, Cuba, will soon be completed. They are receiving training in driving eight light naval vessels, including patrol ships and minesweepers. The trainees are scheduled to return home via the Panama Canal around April 1. For safety and easy access to assistance, these ships will be accompanied

Commercial News Control Gradually Shows Results; Gold Market Speculation Recedes; Closing Price Further Lowered by 40,000

The price of gold bullion remained stable yesterday. The Bank of China allocated 405 bars at the original price of 6.5 million, resulting in a dull morning. The general sentiment was weak, and retreated. The afternoon trend was unable to rally. The morning opening was around 1.65 million, with a low of 1.62 million. Businesses that received allocations found the price higher than the black market price. It briefly rose to 1.68 million mid-day, but then slightly dipped back to the allocation price. The afternoon continued to be weak, falling to around 1.62 million. As a result, the closing price was 40,000 lower than before. Gold jewelry was priced at 176,000 yuan, refined silver at 1,800 yuan. Silver dollars slightly decreased, with sales at 910 yuan. The secret exchange rate remained stable, with interest rates ranging from 1.6 to 2.1 jiao. The Bank of China's control has shown significant effects, with speculators nearly disappearing. Businesses are also losing interest in registered allocated goods. The market situation is likely to remain stagnant for a long time.

U.S. Dollars Mediocre; Hong Kong Notes Fall (New) and Rise (Old)

Foreign exchange U.S. dollars were mediocre. The morning opening was at 2,070 yuan, and it fell to around 2,040 yuan. After 10 o'clock, it slightly rose to 2,080 yuan, but ultimately, due to scattered sentiment, it stagnated at 2,050 yuan at midday. The afternoon remained weak, with buyers watching from the sidelines. As a result, the closing price was slightly lower by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong notes continued to be in high demand. A foreign bank sold Robbie, converting into Hong Kong notes in a significant amount. As a result, the closing price was 10 yuan higher than before. New Hong Kong notes saw no activity, with relentless supply. As a result, the price fell by 5 yuan. Hong Kong Telegraph was at 430 yuan to 450 yuan. Robbie for the current month was at 550 yuan, and for April delivery, it was at 580 yuan.

Government Bonds Stable; Chinese Stocks Show Promise

The government bond market has stabilized. Class C bonds rose from 1,700 yuan to 1,900 yuan, with the midday closing price hovering around 1,850 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 200 yuan higher than before. Other bonds also saw an increase of about 10%. The market was peaceful, driven entirely by retail investors, with speculation of stock market funds moving in. Chinese stocks showed strength, but selling pressure emerged at higher prices, causing some fluctuation. However, speculative funds concentrated on popular stocks, attracting investors from all directions. Those who profited continued to hold on, eagerly seeking to replenish their positions with even slight profits. Therefore, prices were easily pulled up after falling. Yong An, Mayer, and Jing Fu were the three hot stocks, fluctuating around 4,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan, and 200 yuan respectively. The midday closing price was higher than the previous close. Second-tier and unpopular stocks saw increasing demand, with prices rising by about 15%. Foreign stocks were also pulled up, but due to various procedural issues, investors were less interested in them compared to Chinese stocks. As a result, the large stocks only saw a slight improvement, while the small stocks rose by about 5%.

Rice Prices Fall; Flour Continues to Rise by 500-600 Yuan

Yesterday, the rice market saw prices decline by around 2,000 yuan for both japonica and indica rice due to improved weather and weakened sentiment. However, white yuan rice remained scarce and stable. Soybean digestion was sluggish, with prices down by around 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes fell slightly by 100-200 yuan. Corn also decreased by 200 yuan. Sales in Shantou were slow, with shipments from Qingdao still arriving. Oil prices weakened, but transactions were few. Wheat bran remained firm. Peanut sales were brisk, rising by another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Flour prices rose by another 500-600 yuan due to strong demand from Taiwan. The market closed weakly.

Statistics on Rice Arrivals in the Last Six Days

The Rice Market Management Committee recently compiled statistics on the arrivals of various types of rice from March 4 to March 9 as follows: (1) White japonica: 24,707 shi; (2) Thin paddy: 13,057 shi; (3) Sheep indica: 986 shi; (4) Du indica: 2,981 shi; (5) Wu indica: 210 shi; (6) White yuan: 205 shi; (7) Yin yuan: 20 shi. The total is 42,166 shi. Transactions outside the market were similar to those reported in the market, also around 40,000 shi. The total rice arrivals in the six days were 80,000 shi.

U.S. Cotton Settlement Under Control; Hong Kong Notes and Robbie Rise Opportunistically

Recently, old Hong Kong notes have been trending upwards due to the Bank of China's control over U.S. cotton settlements. Drafts were cumbersome. As a result, some yarn and cotton traders gradually shifted to Indian cotton. In order to compete in Far East trade, the British government was willing to provide various conveniences to Chinese importers. Indian cotton imports gradually replaced U.S. cotton. Hong Kong, as a British free port in the Far East, allowed free settlement into any currency within the sterling bloc at the official exchange rate, without restrictions. Therefore, old Hong Kong notes and Hong Kong Telegraph were favored. The official exchange rate between Robbie and the British pound was one Robbie for one shilling and six pence, while Hong Kong notes were one shilling and three pence. The difference was about 15%. Yesterday, Robbie rose to 550 yuan, implying a value of 467 yuan or more for Hong Kong notes. Yesterday, a large exchange was reported at Chase Bank due to this reason. If the U.S. dollar price was used to calculate the British-American exchange rate, Hong Kong notes should also be around 500 yuan.

Yarn Prices Decline; No Development in Spot Cotton

Yesterday, the yarn market began to decline. The green gold market weakened, and speculators were willing to sell their Shuang Ma warehouse receipts at low prices, losing 60,000 yuan each. However, sales of 20-count mixed brands were still good, so prices only fell slightly by 10,000-20,000 yuan. There was slight demand for 32-count single yarn, and 32-count double yarn prices also fell to 1.52 million yuan due to the availability of supplies from the Textile Construction Company on Monday. Sentiment was flat, seemingly waiting for sales to pick up. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company routinely sold items such as wool, linen, silk, and bedding, totaling 24 types. Cotton yarn will be sold today.

Yesterday, New York U.S. cotton prices rose by 2-7 points. The near-term price was 26.97 U.S. dollars, and the far-term price was 26.55 U.S. dollars. The spot price for Middling cotton was 27.38 U.S. dollars. Although there was no special development in the local spot cotton market, the Textile Construction Company urgently needed fine cotton raw materials, and planned to import a total of 2,000 bales of ordinary Middling and extra-grade Brazilian cotton.

Nineteen Sugar Factories in Taiwan Can Continue Operations This Month

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 13th] According to authoritative sources, Taiwan can receive 405,617,073 catties of sugar and 28.5 million catties of molasses. The province has a total of 42 sugar factories, with a sugar production of 1.4 million tons. Only eight factories remained intact after the war without being damaged by air raids. Nineteen factories can resume operations this month. Private sugarcane land totals 117,197 cho, and the sugarcane railway is 2,998 kilometers long. When the Dutch entered Taiwan in 1624, sugar was a major trading item. Since then, sugar has always been Taiwan's main industry. When the Japanese occupied Taiwan, they initially purchased only one set of French sugar-making machinery, and later established four major corporations through incentives for "imitation" or additional equipment, dividing the 42 factories among them.

New Tea Is Coming; Old Tea Is Rarely Sought After

The new tea season is approaching, but due to geographical factors, tea-producing areas cannot all launch at the same time. Wenzhou, Zhejiang, has a warmer climate, so production starts earliest. According to news from that area, although the weather was not very cold last year, the production is not expected to be optimistic due to various influences during the enemy and puppet occupation. Recently, local businesses have been eager to purchase new goods, and have been gathering funds to gain an advantage. They are not interested in old tea, and trading is sluggish. Some sellers are still emerging, causing market prices to soften, resulting in an overall price decrease of 5,000-6,000 yuan compared to the previous market.

Fuel Prices Rise Unstoppably

The coal market saw screened white coal dominate, continuing to thrive and reaching new high prices. The rest remained stable. Firewood and charcoal sales were still strong, and supplies have become slightly smoother than before. Prices remain tight. Hangzhou cargo, dried pine for open-cut mines, is priced at 4,300 yuan per set. Pine firewood at the Tong Ma head is priced at 3,800 yuan per dan.

Summary of Market Conditions

Sugar: The remaining 900 bags of Taiwan green sugar have been opened, but are being held by traders.

North-South Goods: Persimmon cake sales are sluggish, and the melon seed market is in a slump. It is reported that the goods arriving on the Jiangtai and Yongsheng ships have been unloaded and will be available for sale soon.

Industrial Raw Materials: The market situation was mixed yesterday. Caustic soda saw a slight decline due to sluggish demand, with futures contracts being sold off at the end of the month.

Cotton Textiles: Factory supply is gradually increasing, and as cotton yarn prices decline, businesses are generally taking a wait-and-see approach. Prices are trending downwards. However, Three Orange men's socks are selling well and standing out.

Silk: Artificial silk warehouse receipt trading saw prices decline again as warehouses gradually opened and spot goods became more abundant. Factory silk prices slightly decreased with gold prices. Mayer bedspreads were affected by the fall in gold prices, and sentiment softened, with prices falling by 100,000 yuan compared to the listing price. Da Cheng bedspreads weakened slightly by 30,000 yuan, and Da Cheng crepe decreased by 180 yuan. Trading remained low.

Daily Necessities: Huang Xiangmao goods allocated by the former enemy and puppet bureau will be available for delivery soon. Businesses are mostly selling at high prices, and prices are declining, but sales are quite strong. Candles are stable.

Cigarettes: Due to the long-term lack of deliveries from British American Tobacco (BAT), market goods are scarce, and sentiment is strengthening. Prices are rising. Chinese cigarettes, except for Da Gao Le, which slightly declined, are all performing well.

Cosmetics: Solid Tooth Spirit toothpaste is performing well due to the factory's limited supply and dwindling market inventory, coupled with strong purchases from businesses. The rest are stable.

Western Medicine: Quinine inventory is dwindling, and prices are rising again. The rest remain very firm.

Economic Briefs

Many U.S. businesses have placed orders for raw silk from Chinese businesses after the war. It is learned that over 1,000 dan have been successively traded and exported to the U.S. In the future, the government will use the China Silk Company's large-scale production as goods for barter trade with the U.S., and the China Silk Company will be responsible for overall management.

The goods transported from Shanghai to Guangdong by land are mostly yarn, cloth, and miscellaneous goods. As transportation in various areas near the Guangdong market gradually recovers, various goods are selling well. It is learned that goods transported to Guangdong take the route from Jinhua to Shaoguan and then to Guangzhou, taking about one month. The journey is safe.

In addition to banks, silver shops and money shops can also transfer funds between Shanghai and Guangdong, but the exchange rates vary. Recently, the Shanghai-Guangdong telegraphic transfer rate was 9000 yuan, meaning that 9,200 yuan was paid in Guangdong, and 10,000 yuan was collected in Shanghai.

The National Defense Supreme Committee recently re-divided the financial revenue and expenditure system, planning to implement a three-tiered system of national, provincial, and county levels, with township finances included at the county level. The plan is currently being reviewed by relevant authorities.

The total amount of counterfeit money collected by the Central Bank to date is 3 billion yuan, equivalent to 1.5 million yuan in legal tender. The collected counterfeit money, except for a small portion that has been destroyed in various locations, will be destroyed at the Tianzhang Paper Mill in this city. The deadline for collecting counterfeit money is set for the end of March and will not be extended.

The preparatory work for the establishment of the Retail Association of Grain, Oil, and Cake in this city is complete. The first member meeting will be held today at 2:00 PM at No. 377 Minguo Road.

Organization of Agricultural Products Market Raises Questions in Various Industries

(Our Reporter) During the enemy and puppet era, merchants and residents were forced to participate in the puppet Central Market established in this city, which was against their wishes. At that time, if they did not pay market commission, their imported goods would be blocked by the market's rogue-style field personnel, forcing them to pay the commission before being allowed to pass. After the enemy and puppet surrender, the municipal government took over the market. Recently, it was renamed the Shanghai Agricultural Products Market. Initially, the Agricultural Products Market published announcements urging various industries to participate. More recently, the municipal government issued an announcement urging various industries to participate in business operations according to the market's regulations. However, various industries have doubts, with five main points: (1) Whether the nature of the market is different from the puppet Central Market; (2) Paying market commission is equivalent to a disguised tax; (3) The goods transported to this city have already been purchased by various merchants or are transported by the owners and entrusted to various firms for consignment sales, so there is no need to enter the market; (4) This city has a market, but other cities do not. If so, the goods will inevitably be diverted to other cities, which will greatly affect the firms in this city; (5) Since the market is not necessary and participation is not compulsory, various industries hope that the government will change its policy and abandon the original proposal. The North-South miscellaneous goods industry strongly opposes the market's heavy commission and refuses to participate. Associations such as the North Miscellaneous Goods Industry Association, the Dried Longan Miscellaneous Goods Industry Association, and various gang stores from Quanzhou, Xinghua, Xiamen, and Guangdong have unanimously united in opposition. However, the South Goods Industry Association has joined the market because it is an organization of retailers and does not receive many goods directly.

Chiang Ching-kuo Sends Telegram to Zhengqi Middle School; Encourages Teachers and Students to Persevere for Another Year

[Dahua News Agency, Ganzhou] The Zhengqi Middle School founded by Chiang Ching-kuo has started classes this semester. All 400 students have been attending school on time. Wu Jiping, the school's director of academic affairs, said that the school had moved twice last year, so funding had not yet stabilized. Therefore, although many students and their families had applied for admission this semester, they had been strictly tested and the number of admissions limited, so a large number of students could not be accommodated. The school telegraphed Principal Chiang Ching-kuo to inquire about future policies. Chiang replied by telegram, saying: "To my brother Wu Jiping, Director of Academic Affairs of Zhengqi Middle School, your letter has been received. The difficult situation of Zhengqi Middle School is certainly imaginable. I hope that all teachers and students can persevere for another year, and there will be a possibility of development. I wish all teachers and students health and happiness." All the teachers and students were very excited to hear this good news.

Educational Issues in Taiwan Province; Director Fan of the Education Department Issues Statement

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 13th] Fan Shou-kang, Director of the Education Department of Taiwan Province, said: (1) Teacher qualifications: Taiwan Province is experiencing a serious shortage of teachers. Currently, the province's middle schools still need 1,000 teachers, and primary schools need 5,000 to 10,000 teachers. Remedial measures include: (1) Providing short-term training to existing Han teachers to increase their knowledge of Chinese language, literature, history, and other subjects, and instill national concepts and ethnic consciousness.

Training Teachers

(2) Providing short-term training to qualified Taiwanese teachers. (3) Establishing normal schools to train teachers. For middle school teachers, it is planned to establish specialized colleges of literature and history and teacher training classes, and to recruit a large number of teachers from mainland China to come to Taiwan. (2) Educational funding issues: In addition to primary school funding being raised by local governments, secondary and higher schools have suffered war damage and are difficult to recover in the short term. (3) Textbook issues: Because the nationally prescribed textbooks are slightly different from the level of students in this province, they are difficult to adopt in the short term.

Compiling and Printing Textbooks

Taiwan Province has now established a Textbook Compilation Committee for primary and secondary schools and the Taiwan Printing Company to specialize in the compilation and printing of textbooks for primary and secondary schools. (4) National language teaching issues: This is a major problem in teaching at present. It has now been stipulated that from March to September, schools should use the national language as much as possible. This period from March to September can be used as a period for national language tutoring. After September, the next academic year will begin, and teaching will be formally conducted in the national language. (5) Girls' education issues: According to mainland China's regulations, boys and girls have equal opportunities for education.

Promoting the National Language

(6) National language teacher training: Taiwan Province has previously recruited a large number of national language teachers from mainland China to come to Taiwan to promote the national language movement. Nearly one hundred people have arrived in Taiwan successively and are undergoing short-term training. After training, some will be assigned to primary and secondary schools to serve as national language teachers. Another group will be selected for their stronger abilities and divided into groups of three to five people, assigned to various places to establish national language promotion centers.

Regulations for Normal School Graduates' Service; Ministry of Education Issues Circular for Amendment

Anhui Education Department; Improves School Hygiene; Establishes Education and Health Committee to Handle Matters

[Hefei Correspondent] The Anhui Education Department believes that school hygiene urgently needs to be improved to promote the health of students. Therefore, in the second semester of last year, the Education and Health Committee that had been established in the province before the war was restored in Lihuang, and many doctors and nurses were appointed, carrying medicines provided by the department to various schools in the Lihuang urban area to diagnose and treat students' diseases and conduct physical examinations. After half a year of implementation, it has been quite effective. The department now feels that it is necessary to actively promote this work. In addition to moving the general office to its original site in Anqing to continue its work, it also plans to establish branch offices in five locations: Hefei, Wuhu, Bengbu, Tunxi, and Fuyang, and to appoint doctors and nurses and distribute medicines to comprehensively develop health education work.

Hangzhou Municipal Government; Rewards Self-Organized Schools; Relieves Most Out-of-School Children

[Our Correspondent, Hangzhou] Most of the municipal primary schools in Hangzhou started classes on the 25th of last month. However, due to too many school-age children and too few schools, it is impossible to accommodate as many students as possible. As a result, most students are excluded. During the entrance examinations, there are always more than 500 to 600 new students in each grade, but only over 100 are admitted. At the same time, primary school students have geographical limitations and cannot travel far to attend school. This serious situation affects the intellectual level of the next generation, so all sectors are calling on the municipal government to universally establish municipal primary schools and commend all industries for automatically running primary schools to meet the needs.

Tongji University with Thirty-Nine Years of Council Governance (Continued) Huang Kaiqian

The students also valued their physical health quite a bit. When the rooster just crowed to herald the dawn and the boatmen by the river had just opened their sleepy eyes, on the large playground and by the river, you could see countless young people, wearing thin vests and short underwear, each doing their own different calisthenics, taking deep breaths, or jogging naturally along the riverside paths, forming long lines. In the evenings, students gathered in groups of three or five, strolling slowly along the endless riverbank, their eyes quietly fixed on the distant mountains beyond the distant mountains, allowing the time of evening to combine with their ideals, quietly flowing with the mighty river, reaching afar and flowing towards their old homes that they longed for.

Forever Fight Against Nature

The slogan of science and engineering students and professors: "We will forever fight against nature, we will extract everything from nature, we will dig out all the minerals hidden in the earth's crust, fly in the sky, run on the ground, and travel in the water." Medical students said: "We hope that China will have many more outstanding new generations because of us in the future. We hope that every warrior who fights against nature will live to an age that people do not expect."

The winter before last, when students left school to join the army, a representative of the soldiers said at the farewell party: "...On the journey of fighting against nature, today, we have to divide a part of our strength to fight against the people who are invading us...Goodbye! Teachers and students of my alma mater! I hope that our teachers and students, in order to reduce the cruel war between people in the future, will soon launch a larger-scale attack on fire and nature..." These words deeply pierced the hearts of the students and professors. Today, we have won. The professors and students are preparing to join hands with many friends of different nationalities in the near future after returning to Shanghai, blowing the horn of war and launching a large-scale attack on nature.

Working Together to Prepare for the Eastern Relocation

The year before last, there was a rumor that Tongji would be renamed "National Defense University", but the alumni were absolutely opposed. Their meaning: "Why do we need a brilliant name? As long as we have the strength, we will naturally shoulder the important task of national defense. We will naturally build a Great Wall to protect happiness for our country and for mankind. We will never forget the four words 'working together in the same boat'."

Spring has returned. Tongji has spread its white sails and is following the first spring water melted down from the north, riding the spring breeze towards the east. Tongji will joyfully sing the Homecoming Song.

How Much The World’s Neighbors Hope: "China" Is Safe and Well

Special Correspondent in North, Zhang Jianmei

Notes on Inspection with Marshall

(I) Heaven

"Our two parties have been in opposition for eighteen years," Minister Zhang Zhizhong said at the welcome banquet in Yan'an: "Eighteen years is not short, right?" "Only today have we ended eighteen years of opposition," "If China wants to truly become one of the five major powers, it must have twenty to thirty years of peaceful construction"! Although there were four or five hundred Communist Party members who were not used to cheering for a Kuomintang general, there were also sparse applause, which were applause from the heart!

Everyone who has lived in a pavilion will understand that being neighbors with a couple who like to quarrel is even more painful than quarreling yourself. Today, the countries of the world are like residents in a building. "China's peace and prosperity are closely related to world peace and prosperity" (Marshall). How many neighbors in the world hope that there is no quarrel and no fire in the "China" room!

However, the people of China should be the most qualified to demand peace. In the wars within and without the 35 years, they have lost their fathers, children, houses, property, and all the benefits that human beings should enjoy. They cannot possibly survive in war anymore. Thanks to General Marshall, he will always remember these suffering Chinese people. At the banquet hosted by Chairman Mao Zedong in Yan'an, after Mao raised his glass to congratulate President Truman, Chairman Chiang, and General Marshall on their health, he stood up for General Marshall and "Please drink to the people of China!" In fact, he did this almost every banquet. At the banquet hosted by General Wang Yaowu in Jinan, he asked Generals Wang Yaowu and Chen Yi to "Quickly restore transportation, otherwise it will affect the entire people's life and freedom, and it will also affect your children"!

The unanimous and urgent desire of the people across the country, coupled with Marshall's unparalleled enthusiasm and prestige, have become the three agreements of the Peace Canon that have been solemnly signed. Then, the wings of peace of Ma, Zhang, and Zhou swept through every conflict area in the nine provinces north of the Yangtze River in just six days, clearing away the remnants of war. This inspection of peace was successful. Marshall said with satisfaction at the last banquet in Hankou: "Everywhere we go, we get promises to guarantee peace, restore transportation, and allow people to come and go and live freely."

"The Chinese Communist Party has been faithfully implementing the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference," Zhu De declared in a firm voice at the welcome banquet in Yan'an: "We will also earnestly implement the military reorganization plan under the guidance of the military team
