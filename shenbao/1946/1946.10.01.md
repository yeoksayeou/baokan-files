### Chairman Hosts Government Officials at Banquet; Inquires and Discusses Peace Negotiation Procedures; Marshall Exchanges Views with Both Sides

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The situation regarding the Nanjing negotiations is still progressing. Except that the CCP delegation is awaiting instructions from Zhou Enlai and Yan'an and has no activities, the government has frequent contact with American personnel and is actively preparing for the talks that may be convened soon. The document that the government plans to issue will be announced within days. Special Envoy Marshall separately received Dong Biwu and Yu Dawei on the afternoon of the 29th, conveyed to Dong Biwu the Chairman's acceptance of the new mediator's suggestions and his hopes for the Communist Party. Dong also raised the issue of a ceasefire for discussion again. Special Envoy Marshall briefly discussed the progress of these conversations with Ambassador Stuart last night.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Special Envoy Marshall visited the Chairman's residence again at 11:00 am on the 30th to meet and exchange views. Marshall and Stuart met briefly at noon. The Chairman then hosted a banquet for government officials Wu Dingchang, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, Hong Lanyou, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Chen Guofu, Bai Chongxi, Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, Liang Hancao, Wang Yunwu, Peng Xuepei, and other important aides, a total of eighteen people, which was a political banquet attracting attention from all parties. During the banquet, the Chairman inquired about and listened to reports on the progress of peace negotiations and preparations for the National Assembly, and also discussed the procedures for negotiations. From 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Marshall and Stuart met again. At 7:30 pm, the Chairman hosted a banquet for Special Envoy Marshall and his wife. Stuart hosted Wu Dingchang, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, and Shao Lizi at his residence and then held a meeting to discuss the upcoming talks again.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Ambassador Stuart is scheduled to invite Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan on the 1st. Regarding the start date of the talks, this reporter inquired at the CCP office on the evening of the 30th. It was stated that it might be decided when Dong Biwu meets with Stuart again on the 1st.

Wu Dingchang and Shao Lizi Discuss: Believe the Situation Will Soon Become Clear

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Ambassador Stuart hosted a banquet on the evening of the 30th. Although the invitation was sent three days ago, the banquet coincided with the day the peace negotiation situation was decided. Therefore, sensitive news reporters waited for news figures at the entrance of the embassy. At 8:10 pm, the first to be surrounded by reporters was Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang. When asked about the content of the talks at today's banquet, he replied: Today's meeting was about the government's agreement on the negotiation method of three-person and five-person groups proceeding simultaneously. It is now only waiting for Zhou Enlai to return to Nanjing. A reporter asked whether the government would wait until the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou before discussing a ceasefire. Wu answered "Yes." In the past, during the ceasefire in the Northeast, some people believed that Changchun must be recovered, and during the ceasefire in Rehe, Chengde and Chifeng must be recovered. In fact, there is absolutely no requirement to recover Zhangjiakou before discussing a ceasefire. Wu is still very optimistic about the future of peace talks. Later, the reporter visited someone who attended the banquet, who said: It has now reached the decision stage of reopening negotiations, so what was discussed today, importantly, was still the procedural issues of peace talks. The government formally agreed to the simultaneous advancement of political and military affairs, and the simultaneous opening of three-person and five-person meetings. This opinion will be formally notified to Dong Biwu by Stuart on the 1st. It is thought that the situation should be clear soon. The government's concessions have gone from insisting on a five-person meeting, to first a five-person meeting and then a three-person meeting, and then to today's simultaneous opening of three-person and five-person meetings. The government's forbearance has reached the final stage, but let's see the Communist Party's final move.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] This reporter interviewed Shao Lizi, who said: The current negotiation situation is gradually becoming clear. The CCP requires a ceasefire as a guarantee for the meeting, that is, a ceasefire as soon as the meeting opens. The government believes that it is appropriate to open a meeting to discuss the ceasefire issue, and hopes that the CCP can submit a list of National Assembly representatives, then military and political issues can be resolved.

### National Assembly Opening Date Approaches; Preparatory Committee Intensifies Work; CCP Sends Letter to Government Refusing to Participate

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The deadline for convening the National Assembly is only forty-one days away. According to regulations, the registration date for representatives should be ten days before the meeting. The Preparatory Committee of the Assembly, in view of the urgency of time, does not allow any delay in various preparatory tasks. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou today encouraged all working colleagues to concentrate their efforts to complete various preparatory tasks within one month to meet the needs of the Assembly being convened on schedule, and urged supervisors of various departments and groups to pay close attention to assessment in order to strengthen work efficiency.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The National Assembly is scheduled to open in November this year, and the venue is being actively arranged. The venue will be divided into 400 seats for guests and Chinese and foreign reporters. The venue is equipped with special telephone lines and other equipment for full coverage.

[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] The CCP delegation has formally notified the government that it refuses to participate in the National Assembly convened on November 12th. According to the CCP's letter, "There is currently no constitution for the National Assembly to discuss, therefore it is inconvenient to participate." It is expected that the Democratic League will also take a consistent stance with the CCP. According to a CCP spokesperson, "It is rumored that if the government insists on convening the National Assembly in Nanjing, the CCP will convene a representative conference in Yan'an or another location in the Liberated Areas. They have not yet received a formal report. But this is also possible."

### Youth Party Hopes All Parties Will Promote National Assembly Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] A spokesperson for the newly established Central Committee of the Chinese Youth Party stated: The National Assembly is about to be convened, and we are willing to contribute our opinions with sincerity as follows: (1) The purpose of the National Assembly is to seek a national consensus to formulate a constitution, lay the foundation for a democratic political system, and complete the great task of national construction as soon as possible. If the meeting causes disputes, it is not the wish of the people. As President Chiang said, "If after we hold the meeting, we cannot promote national unity, nor can we alleviate the suffering of the people, but instead make the national crisis deeper and the suffering of the people greater," then the meaning and value of holding the meeting will be lost. Therefore, we hope that all parties will consider this point, and that at the very least, the atmosphere of the meeting must be free from the smell of gunpowder before anything can be discussed. (2) The date for the National Assembly to be convened on May 5th this year was originally decided by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). The postponement was also requested by representatives of the PCC. We still hope that the representatives of the PCC will be responsible for promoting the successful convening of the National Assembly in order to realize democratic politics as soon as possible and comfort the long-awaited hope.

### Li Dijun Conveys Sympathy to Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies; No Political Mission Involved; U.S. Troops in China Solely to Assist in Repatriating Prisoners of War

[Our Nanking Correspondent, 30th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press conference at 3:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department. Reporters raised numerous questions to Director He: (Question) Since the victory, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have suffered greatly, with the perpetrators often being minor ethnic groups seeking independence in various regions. Could this be due to our country's lack of strong support for them? Has the foreign affairs authority considered revising its policy? Furthermore, does our negotiation with Indonesia imply recognition of them as a belligerent party? Director He replied: We have always sympathized with the struggles of minor ethnic groups for freedom, and the President has issued proclamations to that effect. However, future actions will depend on their sympathy and response towards us. As for our negotiations with both Dutch and Indonesian sides, it is a practical necessity to protect overseas Chinese and does not imply recognition of Indonesia as a belligerent party. The sympathy mission led by Envoy Li Dijun has absolutely no political mission. However, the results of its on-site observations may provide some reference material for policy making.

(Question) What is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' view on the recent "U.S. Troops Get Out of China Week" movement in Shanghai?

(Answer) The stationing of U.S. troops in China was at the invitation of our government and under the command of the Supreme Commander of the China Theater, to assist the Chinese army in repatriating enemy nationals and prisoners of war. They have achieved great merits over the years, and their mission is not yet fully accomplished. Some individuals, with ulterior motives, have launched this movement, which is detrimental to friendship. I consider it highly inappropriate.

(Question) What is the latest development in the Shibuya case? Is our right to jurisdiction over this case, based on the "victim principle," affected by the fact that it is currently being presided over by a U.S. military court?

(Answer) The Shibuya incident is scheduled to be tried in Tokyo on the 30th. The reason it is being handled by the Allied military court is because Tokyo was only under the occupation and control of the U.S. military at the time, and our occupying forces in Japan had not yet arrived. However, we have sent a judge to participate in the trial, representing our country in exercising jurisdiction.

(Question) Is it currently possible to remit money between the Dutch East Indies and China? (Answer) After the end of the war, the Dutch East Indies did not allow the opening of overseas Chinese remittances due to a shortage of foreign exchange, while local overseas Chinese urgently needed to remit funds to China. After consultation between this Ministry and the Ministry of Finance, a remedial measure was agreed upon, and overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies will soon be able to remit funds back to China.

(Question) What is the latest development in the repatriation of engineering corps workers? (Answer) During the war, 1,154 engineering corps workers from various parts of Southeast Asia returned to China to serve. After the end of the war, they urgently needed to be repatriated. After repeated negotiations between this Ministry and the relevant authorities regarding the entry procedures for their return to their original places of residence, permission has been granted, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has also agreed to assist in their repatriation as soon as possible. Our government has also issued each repatriated engineering corps worker US$200 as an encouragement.

He also stated that a cocktail party may be held when the recent Sino-U.S. commercial treaty is signed, inviting reporters to witness the signing of China's first commercial treaty.

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 30th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press conference at 3:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department and spokesperson. Li Dijun, the special envoy sent by the National Government to express sympathy to overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, also attended. He and Li made the following remarks:

Remarks by Director He

He first provided a detailed analysis of the recent Bagan Siapi-api incident, and then stated that the principles of our attitude are: (1) Strictly maintain neutrality in the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia, and constantly advise overseas Chinese not to participate in the disputes between the two sides. (2) The protection of the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies should be the responsibility of both the Dutch government and the Indonesian authorities. (3) The Dutch government remains our formal diplomatic counterpart. (4) We have no lack of sympathy for any nation striving for its independence and freedom. However, if actions that harm the lives and property of our local overseas Chinese occur during this struggle for national independence, we will lose all sympathy. (5) Regarding the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia, we hope that both sides can reach a reasonable resolution as soon as possible.

Remarks by Envoy Li

Li said: There are over two million overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies, including those born locally, and their economic status is far superior to that of overseas Chinese in other regions. Now, in the aftermath of war, they have suffered great losses. Our government and people deeply sympathize with them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has successively restored all consulates originally stationed in the Dutch East Indies and adopted other measures to maintain stability. Recently, the National Government approved the appointment of myself as a special envoy to convey the Central Government's intentions to the Dutch East Indies, to express commendation for the great contributions of the local overseas Chinese during the war, to express condolences for the losses and suffering they have suffered after the war, and to listen to the opinions of the overseas Chinese and investigate the actual situation, report to the government, and coordinate relief and fundamental solutions. President Chiang will have a message to the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, which I will take with me to convey. This shows the head of state's great concern.

### Our Agreement with UNRRA on Ships Does Not Harm Navigation Rights; Executive Relief Administration Spokesperson Discusses Agreement Contents

[Our Dispatch] Recently, the Executive Yuan approved a supplementary agreement between the Chinese government and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) regarding ships. Some individuals are not clear about the contents of this supplementary agreement. Our reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the Executive Relief Administration to inquire about the truth. The spokesperson stated: "The supplementary agreement on ships recently approved by the Executive Yuan stipulates certain conditions under which UNRRA provides ships to our country. This is completely separate from the case of foreign ships navigating in our inland rivers, which was passed by the Far Eastern Area Committee, and there is no connection whatsoever. The main contents of this supplementary agreement are: (1) All ships provided by UNRRA to China shall fly the Chinese flag; (2) These ships are lent to China for use, and the Chinese government does not pay any price; (3) UNRRA does not require any compensation for damage to the ships during the period of use; (4) If the ships have disputes with third parties during the period of use, the Chinese government is responsible for handling them, and UNRRA is not responsible; (5) During the loan period, the Chinese government may directly operate or entrust shipping companies to operate; (6) Can the loan be renewed after the expiry date? (7) Troops or military supplies may not be carried during the loan period. In summary, it can be seen from the above clauses that the conclusion of this supplementary agreement allows China to obtain the use of some ships without paying any price. The Executive Relief Administration is currently negotiating the terms of the entrusted operation with domestic shipping companies. The above-mentioned supplementary agreement on ships is based on the principle of Article 1, Clause A of the basic agreement signed between UNRRA and the Chinese government in 1945, namely: 'If the materials supplied by UNRRA are equipment for long-term use, a supplementary agreement may be concluded with the Chinese government to retain its ownership, and the equipment will be provided to the Chinese government for use during the effective period of this agreement.' In the past, UNRRA has provided railway locomotives and vehicles to our country and has also concluded similar standby supplementary agreements. As for the case previously passed by the Far Eastern Area Committee of UNRRA allowing foreign ships to navigate in our inland rivers to carry relief materials, our representative Jiang Tingfu has expressed opposition. Although it was passed by a majority of the committee, it has not yet been approved by the UNRRA Central Committee, nor has it been agreed to by the Chinese government. This case has no possibility of being implemented until it is agreed to by the Chinese government. Some individuals have confused this ship supplementary agreement with the previous proposal of the Far Eastern Area Committee, which is ignorant of the facts, because the former is that our country obtains the use of ships without paying a price, which is completely different from the meaning of the proposal of the Far Eastern Area Committee," he said.

The spokesperson also said: As for the reason why Chennault's air transport team has been unable to start flying for so long, the spokesperson declined to provide an explanation, only saying: Chennault's air transport team is an independent organization and is not part of the Executive Relief Administration, so the Executive Relief Administration has no obligation to provide an explanation on its behalf.

### Receiving Executive Relief Administration Ships

Shipping Association Holds Meeting to Discuss

[Our City Dispatch] Regarding the matter of the shipping industry taking over the "Executive Relief Administration's" Water Transportation Brigade and establishing the "Jiyun Office," shipping association representative Wei Wenhan, Executive Relief Administration representative Liu Hongsheng, and UNRRA representatives Giggleson and Annas, and more than ten other people, held three meetings yesterday afternoon to discuss the signing of the contract and the transfer date.

As for all the ships of the brigade, the total number, excluding barges, is forty-five or six, totaling more than 36,000 tons. In the near future, dozens more ships will be arriving in Shanghai from the United States.

### Shanghai Representatives Petition in Nanjing; Suggest Government Improve Economic Policies; Pan Xulun Speaks of Strictly Implementing Import-Export Chains

[Our Nanking Correspondent, 30th] Xu Jiqing, Luo Qinghua, and Xu Guomao, representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council's petition delegation, arrived in Nanking successively on the 30th, and other representatives will arrive in turn. It is heard that the petition delegation will stay in Nanking for two or three days and will petition to the Executive Yuan, the Supreme National Defense Council, and other agencies, and will return to Shanghai after being received by the President.

[Our Nanking Correspondent, 30th] Luo Qinghua, a representative of the Shanghai Municipal Council's petition delegation, told reporters on the 30th that the main purpose of the delegation's visit was to suggest to the government that it comprehensively improve its financial and economic policies so that the economy, which is on the verge of collapse, can be restored. It is said that a year has passed since the victory, but the government is still implementing wartime economic policies, which greatly hinders economic recovery. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can quickly place its economic policies on a peacetime footing, change the past policy of contracting credit and inflating currency, and vigorously expand credit and contract currency to support industry and encourage exports.

[Our Nanking Correspondent, 30th] Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, told our reporter on the 30th: Many of the points suggested in the telegrams sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council's petition delegation to various government agencies are already being implemented by the government. In terms of international trade, the recent import and export figures have gradually approached each other, and subsidy policies are also in progress. The implementation of the import-export chain system was previously proposed by the industrial and commercial community's petition delegation, but there are differing opinions from all parties, and implementation may be difficult. As for the method of barter trade, the government is also carrying it out. The Soviet Union, Siam, and some South American countries are exchanging goods with us. Regarding the use of economic diplomacy, we have sent many representatives to attend the upcoming international trade conference in the United Kingdom, and other aspects are also being noted.

Pan also said: The establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Supervision Office is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. According to relevant sources, the local Industrial and Commercial Supervision Offices can be established successively in mid-October.

Before his departure, Brind met with reporters and said that he was deeply honored to have the opportunity to meet President Chiang, which was his long-cherished wish.

Brind said: "I have met people from all walks of life in Shanghai, and I have a very deep impression of Mayor Wu's wisdom and amiability. I am also grateful for Mayor Wu's hospitality." Brind finally said: "I am a naval officer, and if I am not afraid of being verbose, then I believe that Shanghai's commerce still needs to be revitalized.

### Female Workers Beat Up Manager in Wuxi Silk Factory Strike

[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 30th] Strikes in silk factories in this county have occurred repeatedly, which is a serious problem in society. If it is not resolved quickly, it may affect local security. This morning, Chen Wanxiang, the manager of Zhenlun Silk Factory in Nanmen, was beaten up by female workers again.

After this joint trial, the results will be reported to the Central Government, and the final judgment will await the approval and announcement of the Central Government.

### Zhang Jia'ao Reports on the Work of the Northeast Economic Commission in Shenyang; Elucidates Future Measures in Detail

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th] Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Northeast Economic Commission, recently gave a speech on the work of the Economic Commission since May and the measures to be taken in the future, stating that the Commission immediately began to rebuild the Northeast's economic order after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. (1) The restoration of transportation and communications. Today, the railways, postal services, telegraphs, and telephones between Shenyang, Changchun, Dehui, Jilin, and other cities and Pingjin within the Guan (Shanhai Pass) have been restored. (2) The establishment of financial institutions. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Farmers Bank of China, and Central Trust Bureau have all decided to establish branches in various cities. (3) The stabilization of the currency system. After the consolidation of stamped legal tender and Red Army notes, circulating coupons have become the main currency. Since the opening of commercial remittances, their position has become even more stable. (4) The distribution of enemy and puppet factories. Based on their nature, they were divided into central direct operation, local government operation, Production Bureau operation, or private operation, and the distribution work is almost complete. As for the future, it has been decided to carry out: (A) Those mainly led by the central government include: (1) Improving railway transportation, such as enhancing commercial transportation between various parts of the Northeast and within and outside the Guan. (2) Building a financial network. National and private banks should develop simultaneously, dividing labor and cooperating. The plan can be implemented after government approval. (3) The recovery of industry. In terms of heavy industry, a plan has been agreed upon with Director Qian Changzhao of the Resources Commission and can be implemented next month, with possible restoration and suitability to needs as the criteria for restoration. Light industry can be started separately after sufficient electricity is available, but there are too many units, making progress more difficult. (4) Strengthening the supply of materials. Prices are generally soaring, making stabilization difficult, but materials must be distributed reasonably and fairly. Coal distribution has already begun, and flour is also being prepared. Cloth is the most difficult to obtain in the Northeast, and it is currently being purchased and transported in batches from within the Guan. The Liaoyang and Yingkou textile factories received by the China Textile Corporation have already started production. (B) Those mainly led by local governments: (1) Consider establishing county banks. In the past, the establishment of provincial banks in various provinces did not achieve results due to a lack of planning. Now it is planned to establish them simultaneously in the counties of the recovered provinces, with supervisory agencies in each province and a regulatory agency in the Northeast. (2) Universally establish rural cooperatives to promote improved agriculture, guide cultivation, and issue strict loans. In addition, plans are being prepared to increase production and improve collective production methods, so that agricultural products can be sold through convenient channels at reasonable prices, reducing the suffering of farmers, and establishing state granaries to purchase and store food at market prices in order to stabilize high food prices. However, all plans rely on the establishment of local order and the guarantee of security.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th] The Northeast Economic Department's Commissioner's Office officially closed on the 30th, and the Resources Commission took over the various industrial and mining enterprises it had received.

### Adjustment of Northeast Postal Rates Takes Effect Today

[Our Changchun Correspondent, 29th] The postal rates in the Northeast will be adjusted starting from the first of next month. Xiao Jingyi, Director of the Jilin Postal Administration, said at a press conference last night that the temporary method of charging postal rates in the Northeast was decided by the Northeast Executive Council's Economic Commission this spring, charging five times the Manchukuo postal rates. Adjustments have been proposed repeatedly, but they have been delayed due to the situation. Recently, the central government decided to adopt a consistent method of charging postal rates with the Guan (Shanhai Pass), and the ratio of legal tender to circulating coupons is still 1 to 13. The conversion and odd numbers are rounded off to the nearest whole number, so the adjusted postal rate is two yuan for a regular letter, and the rate for books and printed matter remains 5 jiao per hundred grams. Xiao continued, saying that the purpose of this adjustment of postal rates is to unify postal rates, not to increase prices. Finally, Xiao said that only 600,000 letters were sent from Jilin in August.

### Zhejiang Labor Relief Commission Established

### New York Herald Tribune Editorial: The So-Called "U.S. Troops Out of China Week" Only Seeks to Strengthen American Isolationist Policy

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 29th] The New York Herald Tribune recently published an editorial criticizing certain factions in China for initiating a "U.S. Troops Out of China Week." It stated: This movement, initiated by the American Communist Party and its supporters, and supported by a few misguided liberals, can be summed up in one sentence: If U.S. troops withdraw from China, the Soviet Union will take over, and that's all there is to it. The pretext of this movement is none other than to strengthen America's isolationist policy. What we are concerned about is that the Chinese government is greatly encouraging this Communist movement. Why do we say this? Because every action of a small number of officials in the Kuomintang, every ban on free speech, and every failure to fulfill democratic promises are fully exploited by the Communist Party as propaganda material.

Editorial

### Advocating for "Contributing Schools" as Birthday Greetings

After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, our government immediately announced that "Education Comes First" during the period of national reconstruction, which demonstrates the government's emphasis on education. However, in the past year, the nation has faced many misfortunes, hindering the smooth progress of demobilization work according to plan. The present situation is chaotic, and construction has not yet begun. Even education, which is ranked first in importance, has not achieved significant progress. Let alone higher education and specialized education, even basic national education still has a significant illiteracy rate. During the War of Resistance, educational institutions suffered severe destruction from the enemy and had to relocate inland with the government. The facilities in the rear were much simpler than before the war. Once victory arrived, the hurried demobilization and the lack of transportation made it difficult for faculty and students to move east. Furthermore, relocating schools back to their original sites proved extremely challenging. Moreover, most of the original school sites were damaged by the enemy and rendered unusable, requiring significant funds for reconstruction. Therefore, in the year since the victory, local education authorities have only been able to focus on educational rehabilitation and have been unable to spare resources for the plan to establish more national schools to popularize education. As a result, a large number of children are excluded from national schools and cannot enjoy their right to compulsory education. The education authorities are well aware that this is a shameful phenomenon, but they are constrained by economic limitations and cannot "cook without rice," so they have no choice but to stand idly by, letting things drift. People in the education and cultural circles are all deeply concerned about this crisis facing education in our country.

"It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to nurture people." Education is a century-long plan for the nation. Therefore, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly exhorted the people of the country to prioritize "Education First." Imagine that in the future, China must strive for democratization in politics, industrialization in economics, and modernization in the military. To achieve these three goals, the popularization of education is an urgent prerequisite. Democratic politics is based on universal suffrage, and the thoroughness of universal suffrage is a measure of the degree of democracy. Today, citizens eligible to vote must not only understand their personal interests but also have a clear understanding of the domestic and international situation. How can we expect someone who has not completed elementary school to vote correctly? Regarding economic industrialization and military modernization, how can we expect a worker, a farmer, or a soldier who has not graduated from national school to become a sound worker, a farmer who can use machinery, or a soldier who can use modern weapons?

When the Shanghai Municipal Council recently met to discuss education-related plans, councilors strongly advocated for national education, arguing that the Municipal Education Bureau should weigh the priorities and concentrate all its efforts on popularizing national education, while temporarily postponing other superficial matters. This shows their ability to see the bigger picture. We believe that the popularization of education is related to the major plan of national construction and the interests of the majority of the people. It is not just a matter for Shanghai, but a task that the entire country must resolve to complete in the shortest possible time. This year marks Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday, which is approaching rapidly. The Chairman led the revolutionary Northern Expedition and then led the War of Resistance against Japan.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Representatives Petition in Nanjing

The current economic malady can be simply summarized in one word: "high." High interest rates, high labor costs, high shipping fees, high taxes, high prices, and a high volume of banknotes are all widely recognized facts.

How can we lower these high levels and rescue the economic crisis? We must study this issue from both its symptoms and its root causes. Fundamentally, we must restrict the amount of currency issued and contract it, so that prices, taxes, costs, and so on can be gradually reduced. However, this is closely related to politics. If the political ailments cannot be thoroughly cured, then demanding currency contraction and the return of legal tender to the treasury may be like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree.

There are many remedies for the symptoms. The suggestions made by the previous Shanghai business and industry delegation and those brought by the current Shanghai Municipal Council delegation, broadly speaking, are all timely and meritorious achievements that will be immortalized in the modern history of our country. All Chinese people, rejoicing at this auspicious occasion, would like to offer him a toast. However, during the period of national reconstruction, hardships and difficulties are even greater than during wartime. The entire nation should practice frugality, bury themselves in the work of national construction, and not retreat in the slightest. Moreover, the Chairman is known for his frugality and simplicity, and we should not go against his wishes. Recently, more than ten people from the Shanghai education and cultural circles have initiated the "Contributing Schools" method to celebrate his birthday. Nanjing, Hankou, and other places have responded enthusiastically. This initiative aims to celebrate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday on the one hand, and to open up a new avenue for popularizing education on the other, achieving two goals at once. We fully agree with this in principle and hope that the people of the country will respond enthusiastically and donate funds voluntarily, so that we can achieve the goal of at least one school per town or one school per district. If this becomes a national trend, then ten years later, when Chairman Chiang celebrates his seventieth birthday, how many millions of out-of-school children will benefit from the "Contributing Schools" campaign? These are our new generation, the future masters of the nation, and the place where we place our hopes. The nation and society have a duty to ensure that these new generations have the opportunity to enjoy education. Even the Chairman himself should tacitly approve of this tax-raising method for popularizing education and be optimistic about its success. The disadvantages are obvious. What we want to suggest to the representatives of the Municipal Council is not to add more methods, but to make sincere statements and arouse the sincere understanding of the authorities, and not just to engage in formalities.

Sun Yat-sen said: "Knowing is easy, acting is difficult." This is indeed true. Any difficult problem, as long as it is truly understood, will always have a solution and the power to overcome it. The eight-year War of Resistance was finally won because of the genuine understanding of the people and the government. We do not believe that if the government truly understood the pain of the people and the crisis facing business and industry, it would be at a loss and unable to come up with a solution.

If we were to say that the authorities do not understand the current economic crisis, that would be a gross accusation. We believe that this time the representatives' request will surely receive the sympathy, acceptance, consideration, research, and even separate implementation of the authorities. There is no doubt about this. The question is: To what extent will they sympathize? How will they handle the acceptance? What will be the result of the consideration and research? Will the efforts to implement it only be efforts in name only? Will the implementation be serious and thorough? These are the questions that remain.

Take the issue of commodity prices, for example. Whether it is the central government or the local government, which authority is not shouting about suppressing prices? Which competent authority is not implementing the policy of suppressing prices? Unfortunately, while they are suppressing prices, prices continue to rise, as if they can coexist and operate independently. If you were to ask them, you would surely get the answer: "There is no perfect solution." It is true that there is no perfect solution, but to have exhausted one's wisdom and ability and still be unable to come up with a perfect solution is probably not true!

Upon careful examination, we feel that this kind of superficial attitude is not so much due to the difficulty of implementation as to insufficient understanding and excessive adherence to fixed ideas. Because of insufficient understanding, they deal with matters perfunctorily, focusing only on superficial embellishments. In the end, they excel at deceiving people. Because of excessive adherence to fixed ideas, they are prejudiced and stubborn, and their minds are narrow, making it impossible for them to accept the opinions of others. The result is that any policy is implemented half-heartedly, and they believe that this half-hearted policy is just right. In any case, they are unwilling to make any amendments, let alone changes or modifications. The Shanghai Municipal Council's petitioning representatives are in Nanjing this morning to present their case to the highest authorities and competent officials. We believe that they represent not only the Municipal Council, nor only the business and industry community, but also all 4.5 million citizens of Shanghai. Their opinions may be the wishes of the people of the entire nation. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will pay attention to their appeals. On the other hand, we hope that the petitioning representatives will make their greatest efforts to awaken the authorities' genuine understanding of the current economic crisis. "Knowing is easy, acting is difficult!" This is Sun Yat-sen's legacy. If the authorities truly know that the crisis is imminent, how can there be no reason to adopt measures to resolve the crisis?

### Seagull Gunboat Flees After Smuggling, Two Lighters Carrying Goods Captured Outside Zhanjiang, Guangzhou Thoroughly Investigates Case of Military Supplies Embezzlement

[This newspaper's Guangzhou dispatch, 30th] Wu Qushi, Director of the Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou, which is affiliated to the Naval Ordnance Department, is accused of embezzling a large batch of shipbuilding machinery worth over ten million yuan. Naval Commissioner Zou Yi has dispatched personnel to detain him and is thoroughly investigating personnel involved in the case. Furthermore, the Seagull gunboat No. 26, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Naval Commissioner, was ordered to Zhujiang City to patrol the coast. It was discovered to be smuggling, and the ship fled in fear of punishment. Its whereabouts are still unknown. Recently, the Naval Commissioner's office received an urgent telegram from Naval Headquarters ordering a swift investigation into the ship's whereabouts and ordering the arrest of the ship's captain, Xu Xianfen, for further investigation and punishment.

[Guangzhou News] The warship "Seagull" often patrolled the sea surface after the victory, traveling between Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, and other places. Later, it was widely rumored that the Seagull often transported large quantities of smuggled goods. In May of this year, a minor conflict occurred on the sea near Zhujiang City with the garrison troops. It was not until the garrison troops were transferred that the Seagull dared to return. When the Seagull arrived in Zhujiang City, on the morning of September 17th, someone hired civilian ships for a high price in Xiying to transport goods outside the port. After Customs learned of this, they mobilized all armed customs police and, together with local military and police, monitored the waterway between Xiying and Chikan. At around 2:00 AM, two cargo ships silently sailed into the waters of Xiying. The customs police shouted a warning, and the cargo ships, caught off guard, surrendered. An inspection revealed that the two ships were carrying over four hundred items of smuggled goods, worth over 80 million yuan. Three naval soldiers were found on board. Customs, together with military and police authorities, are strictly investigating this case.

[Guangzhou News] Previously, Mo Yushi, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Military Affairs, had not completed the procedures for receiving enemy and puppet military supplies and for cleaning up after the withdrawal. The Investigation Team found many suspicious points and requested instructions from the Ministry of National Defense via telegram. Mr. Mo has returned to Guangzhou from Nanjing, and Director Zhang Fakui ordered him to complete all the procedures as soon as possible. Although Mr. Mo was specially allowed to reside in the cleanup office, a squad of military police was stationed to guard him. After arriving in Guangzhou, Mr. Mo visited Yang, the head of the Investigation Team, and openly received reporters, expressing that he would not shirk any responsibility. However, during the receiving process, there were many complexities, and some procedures may not have been completed. He will expedite the completion of each item. Regarding the rumors that the 173 boxes of special drugs contained opium and narcotics, he hopes that the Investigation Team will thoroughly investigate the truth.

### Refugees in Xuyi Endure Intolerable Suffering, Armed Advance to Reclaim Homeland, Communist Troops Defeated Before the True Power of the People

[This newspaper's Mingguang News] Xuyi County, Anhui Province, borders Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. It was invaded by communist troops in 1939, who used it as their base in the Huainan region. The people were brutally murdered, and they fled in large numbers. Last month, communist troops launched an offensive and harassed the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. National troops were forced to counterattack, and all the towns and villages in the county have been successively recovered, except for the towns and villages in the old Third District in the western part of the county, which are still occupied by communist troops. The refugees who fled the area, unable to endure the suffering of displacement, voluntarily organized a "Patriotic People's Return Home Corps." On September 9th, the organization was completed, and it was reported to the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, the Provincial Security Command, the Commissioner's Office, the County Government, and other agencies for record. It stated: "Since the Japanese invaders started the war, the Central Plains have been in turmoil. In 1938, the government moved west, and the entire southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway fell into enemy hands. Although all of Xuyi was isolated behind enemy lines, the people still united and fought the enemy with arms, making desperate efforts. Government laws and regulations could still be implemented as before. Xuyi City was twice occupied and recovered by local armed forces, making a glorious contribution to the history of national self-defense. Unexpectedly, communist troops took the opportunity to invade in the spring of 1939. Under the guise of unified resistance against Japan, they secretly expanded their army and seized territory. Local people, out of respect for national righteousness, feared hindering the great cause of resistance and national construction, and had no choice but to endure the suffering. Communist troops were able to develop leisurely and grow stronger day by day. First, they confiscated the people's arms and destroyed the administrative organization. Then, they arrested and killed intellectuals and wealthy families. Their insidious, treacherous, and cruel methods knew no bounds. All the ethical codes and moral principles of our five thousand years of history were destroyed without exception. The local people, except for those who had been brutally murdered or coerced, had mostly fled. Time flies, and eight years have passed. Our refugee compatriots have been exposed to the elements and have suffered from hunger and cold and the spread of epidemics. The old and weak have died in ditches, while the strong have become emaciated. The living have nothing to eat, and the dead have nothing to be buried with. Wives and children are separated, and the tragedy is unbearable. After the victory, the communist troops not only did not repent but intensified their brutal killings to eliminate their so-called middle class, forcing innocent people to serve in the front lines and transport supplies. Even poor families had no choice but to embark on the path of exile. Who does not have parents? Who does not have a wife and children? At this time of life and death separation, how can they not shed tears? The ancestors' tombs are all in their homeland. After the first anniversary of the victory, when the world is celebrating, they are still forced to wander and be displaced. With their hometown in sight, they have no tears to shed. Therefore, on September 5th, they convened a meeting of refugee patriots and decided to organize the Xuyi County West Third District Patriotic People's Return Home Corps, and publicly appointed the current Deputy Speaker of the County Council, Kan Jimin, as the commander, and Zhou Aimen and Fu Xuewu as the brigade commanders. The seven towns and villages in the West Third District were divided into seven companies, subordinate to the two brigades. The company commander positions were concurrently held by the current town and village chiefs. The organization was established immediately, and they pledged to enter the territory, vowing not to coexist with the communist bandits who exterminate humanity. Once they enter the territory and the basic government can be promoted, they will incorporate all their arms into the normal organization of the government, and the name of the "Return Home Corps" will be announced for cancellation.

[Another News] The Xuyi County West Third District Patriotic People's Return Home Corps set out from Sangji Township (35 li east of Mingguang) on September 10th. On the same day, they arrived at Liangshan. On the 11th, they headed towards Gupai, the base of the communist troops in the three counties of Xuyi, Fengyang, and Jiashan. They engaged in battle with the communist troops' independent battalion. The patriotic people, fueled by years of resentment, were each worth a hundred men. After a fierce battle, the communist troops were defeated and retreated, capturing many military supplies and documents. They then conducted searches in nearby villages. On the 19th, they advanced north again. Communist troops set up ambushes at Yinjiqiao, Wawu, Zhao, and other places, attacking from two directions. We bravely attacked, and the communist troops, unable to withstand the attack, retreated in two directions. We also divided our troops to pursue and search the recovered areas. On the 22nd, communist troops built fortifications in the Dagukou area, relying on the terrain to resist stubbornly. After four hours of fierce fighting, we finally broke through the communist fortifications, and the communist troops fled in panic towards Huaibei. We sank five of their boats, killed more than forty communist troops, captured several alive, and seized one rifle and several hand grenades. The number of drowned and dead is still difficult to estimate. Only one of our people was injured.

### Changshu, Taicang, and Kunshan Launch Suppression Campaign, Unifying Party-Government-Group, Strengthening Propaganda

[This newspaper's Changshu News] This area is located near the river, and the suppression campaign is about to begin. This county discovered bandit traces and was severely punished for poor transportation. Security measures have been established: (1) Unify the party, government, and groups, organize a propaganda team, go deep into the people, and be responsible for promoting national policies, so that every citizen will automatically assist the government in promoting security matters. (2) Strengthen local team strength, strictly train and equip the township self-defense forces, and build a strong force to protect the local area, fundamentally eliminating bandit traces. (3) After the township and village chiefs complete their pledges, district chiefs will be required to complete joint pledges. These tasks will be started at the beginning of next month by County Magistrate Pan, Secretary-General Zhao, and Director Leng, who will jointly depart to the districts and townships to provide practical guidance and implementation.

[Another News] The county government received an order from the province: Regarding Article 16 of the "Regulations on the Implementation of the Baojia System," which does not provide detailed regulations for temples, ancestral halls, churches, guild halls, etc., in the Baojia, the method of investigation should be consistent across the board. However, monks and Taoists are often not noticed, and are allowed to come and go as they please without reporting household registration changes. Temple abbots also only rely on the ordination certificate to accommodate them without investigation, making it easy for traitors to mingle. It is now ordered to conduct a thorough investigation in conjunction with the local Buddhist Association and Taoist Association. In the future, the movements of monks and Taoists must be reported in accordance with changes in registration, and it must be implemented effectively.

[Another News] The suppression campaign is about to begin here. Deputy Commander Guo of the Paratrooper Brigade, County Magistrate Pan, Secretary Zhao, and others are scheduled to jointly inspect the eastern villages and the Kunshan-Taicang border on the first day, providing guidance in person.

[Another News] Changyinsha in the Fifth District of Nantong County is adjacent to the Seventh District of this county. The provincial government previously ordered it to be placed under the jurisdiction of this county. County Magistrate Pan Yichen was ordered to go and take over, but the local people organized groups to oppose the takeover and even made a declaration to risk bloodshed. This matter has now been resolved. The provincial government sent another telegram to County Magistrate Yang of Nantong, ordering him to hand over the area to this county within a specified time and ordering this county to quickly take over. According to a telegram from the provincial government to various sectors, the current placement is necessary for unified military command, and the affiliation will be determined again after the end of military operations.

[This newspaper's Kunshan News] Liu Zheng, Commander of the Fourth Brigade of the Paratrooper Corps, was appointed as the Commander of the First Suppression District of Yangcheng Lake. To plan the suppression matters in this area, he convened suppression meetings with the responsible persons of party, government, and military units in Taicang and Kunshan, respectively, starting on the 27th. During the meetings, Mr. Liu provided detailed instructions on the suppression matters and then conducted thorough discussions, which resulted in the following decisions: (1) Thoroughly achieve the unification of party and government, (2) Report as much as possible on traitors and Baojia chiefs and people who collude with and harbor bandits, (3) Reorganize the Baojia, (4) Reorganize the self-defense forces, (5) Investigate the number of eligible young men and the number of people in various occupations.

### Tragedy in Jiujiang: Returning Soldier Beaten to Death, Incident Occurs in Front of Cinema, Fortunately Averting Major Accident

[This newspaper's Jiujiang dispatch, 30th] At 7:00 PM on the 29th, a tragic incident occurred in front of the Jiujiang Youth Cinema, in which a returning soldier was beaten to death. According to investigation, eight people were killed or injured on the spot. The perpetrators were the guard soldiers stationed at the Youth Cinema by a certain brigade recently transferred to Jiujiang to maintain order.

However, as of 5:30 PM today, when this newspaper's reporter left Xun via airplane, the Jianghan ship was still docked at the Jiujiang Naval Pier. It is clear that the case has not been resolved because both sides hold different views.

Nazi War Criminal Sketches (Special Translation by this Newspaper's Editorial Department)

Göring
He was the Commander-in-Chief of the German Air Force and a chief administrator in the Nazi organization. Initially, his stubborn personality and abundant capabilities seemed to be swaying the court; however, after hearing many of his legendary statements being thoroughly attacked by other defendants, he had to calm down. Schacht described him as a Roman tyrant who dyed his toenails and wore jewels on his hands, and as Judge Jackson read this passage aloud, he requested morphine from the court but did not receive it. Göring's defense was as follows: he claimed to be loyal to Hitler, a faithful but misguided second-in-command of the Nazis. Regarding the allegation that the German Air Force used humans for experiments in an attempt to improve itself, he insisted he had no knowledge of it.

Hess
He was Hitler's designated successor, who once flew to England and was detained there until the end of the war. After returning to Germany, he said he had lost all memory. The court said his amnesia was feigned, arousing great suspicion among the public. He refused to defend himself, and his lawyer said Hess was insane. He was pale, with wide eyes, as if having little interest in the trial. In court, his stomach often convulsed, causing him to bend over and arch his back. He refused to take medication, fearing he would be poisoned.

Ribbentrop
This very elegant Nazi Foreign Minister seemed to have the worst physical and mental condition. His former uniform, covered with medals, has been replaced by civilian clothing, his hair has turned white, and his complexion is gray. When Göring attacked him, he occasionally attempted to smile, but even smiling seemed very difficult. In the final debate, Sir Shawcross called him an "assassin," and he staggered forward, wanting to defend himself, but almost fell to the ground. The court accused him of preparing the path for Hitler's aggression, and his response was that he had only told some "diplomatic lies."

Keitel
Although the insignia on his green army uniform had been removed, his handsome profile and neat mustache made him look like a benevolent grandfather. When Sir Hartley described the atrocities committed by the German army against Jewish populations in Poland and the Soviet Union, he cried out. His defense was similar to that of ordinary soldiers, that he was only following Hitler's orders. His lawyer admitted that Keitel knew he had committed serious crimes, and largely admitted the points indicated in the indictment. He said he opposed the invasion of the Soviet Union and repeatedly sought to resign but was not permitted.

Streicher
This figure, known for his anti-Semitism, claimed to be the first person in the world to advocate for Jewish restoration. He said his anti-Semitic plan was only aimed at establishing a homeland for Jews in Madagascar. This man, with silver-white hair and a face shaped like an ax, told the court that he ordered the demolition of the Nuremberg synagogue only because it was incompatible with the city's ancient Gothic architecture.

Funk
This former German Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank often said he was a very sick old man, but he never missed a single session. He was one of the earliest Nazis, but he said he was an insignificant person. The point he argued most fiercely was that he said he did not know that the German guards had taken the gold teeth from the bodies of Jewish women killed in concentration camps and deposited them in the Reichsbank.

Schacht
This once internationally renowned banker and economist constantly expressed indignation at being tried alongside other war criminals. He had taken various radical economic measures to implement Germany's rearmament, but he said he had tried to stop Hitler since 1938. His sole defender, Sevius, came from Switzerland and testified that Schacht had led the July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler. Judge Jackson specifically attacked him once during the final trial, saying that he would never participate in a movement unless its success was fully guaranteed, and would flee as soon as there were signs of failure.

Dönitz
Hitler had chosen him to be the head of the last Nazi government, but he himself said that he was a person completely without political ambition. He considered himself to have adhered to the rules of war during the submarine warfare. His defense lawyer presented an affidavit from Nimitz, which stated that the United States ordered the launch of unrestricted submarine warfare after the Pearl Harbor attack. Dönitz vehemently denied that he had ever planned a war of aggression.

Raeder
This 70-year-old naval chief believed that Germany's rearmament, in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles, was purely defensive in nature and said he had no knowledge of any war of aggression. Raeder admitted that as early as October 1939, he had suggested an attack on Britain, but he said his purpose was only to prevent Britain and France from preemptively striking.

Papen
Although he had gone through nine months of lengthy trials, this diplomat, known for plotting since the First World War, remained very elegant. He spoke to the court as casually as he would to people in a club, talking endlessly about how difficult it was to conduct diplomacy under Hitler and that it was impossible to stop him. He said that he took office for Hitler only to reform him with responsibility. He even said that he had participated in the plot to assassinate Hitler.

Mayor Wu Invites Various Industries to Discuss Price Stabilization Issues; Cotton Cloth and Woolen Goods Create a Situation of Scarcity; Decision to Organize a Price Review Committee
[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu, in view of the recent dramatic price fluctuations, specially invited representatives of the directors and supervisors of various trade associations in the city to hold a discussion yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Those present included Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association; Qu Zhenhua of the Rice Dealers' Association; Xie Hengzong of the Coal Industry Association; Zheng Yitong of the Sugar Industry Association; Fu Changyu of the Grains, Oil Cakes, and Bran Association; Tong Feiyang of the Woolen Goods Association; Wu Weijing of the China Textile Corporation; Xian Zhunian of the Flour and Bran Association; Fei Yuansong of the Rayon Association; Cha Zesan of the Grains and Rice Sales Association; Qiu Mingshen of the North Goods Association; Yu Pinru of the South Goods Association; Zhang Shouren of the Vegetable Association; Yang Liren of the Woolen Textile Industry Association; Zhou Jiasheng of the Yarn Merchants Association; Zhu Zhigao of the Fresh Meat Industry Association; Han Jingquan of the Cooked Water Industry Association; Dong Jiuhui of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association; Zhang Wenkui of the Department Store Association; Zhan Jiansheng of the Gold Industry Association; Shi Zhidang of the New Medicine Industry Association; Liu Gongyun of the Enemy and Puppet Assets Processing Bureau; and Xu Letian of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting and briefly stated: The reason for convening everyone today is because there have been many fluctuations in market prices recently, so I hope that representatives of the trade associations can accurately review how to make them tend to balance. It should be particularly pointed out that the price of rice, which is the mainstay of the people's food, has not risen at present. The flour industry has also stipulated that its price is 14,000 yuan per dan, but now it has risen to 17,000 yuan, and the authorities are trying to stabilize it. The government can directly allocate 70% of the total amount of edible oil needed by the city, and there is no possibility of price increases. Therefore, in recent days, the price of deep-fried dough sticks, which are the greatest threat to people's livelihood, has doubled, which is really unreasonable and must be banned to stabilize people's livelihood. Secondly, the price of cloth and cotton yarn has also risen recently, which has a direct impact on the lives of ordinary people. We must pay attention to whether there is any corruption or uneven distribution during allocation. Also, the vegetable industry

Two Banquets Welcoming and Farewell

General Cooke Explains the Mission of the U.S. Military in China to Reporters
[Report from this newspaper] General Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and his wife arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao the day before yesterday and are scheduled to return to Qingdao today. General Cooke received local reporters at the Cathay Hotel at 2:30 PM yesterday. General Cooke reiterated the mission of the U.S. military in China, which is to assist China in completing its surrender work, such as repatriating Japanese troops, and to assist China in its construction work after more than eight years of arduous resistance. This is purely a transitional period. Our purpose is to help China become a strong country in the international arena. The Military Mediation Department Executive Group established in Beiping is also a major task in this mission. U.S. troops have a road protection team stationed on the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao railway line to maintain traffic and transmit telecommunications between Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. However, this work can be difficult at times, and we are always concerned.

General Cooke then answered several written inquiries. To date, the U.S. Navy has assisted in the transportation of approximately 250,000 Chinese troops. The last time Chinese troops were transported was in June. In January of this year, it also assisted in transporting Communist troops from Hong Kong and Guangzhou to Yantai and other places.

The U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao and Qinhuangdao has reduced and demobilized two divisions. The main task of the Marine Corps at present is to maintain the transportation of the Military Mediation Department Executive Group and train the Chinese Navy. The number of Chinese Navy personnel being trained varies from time to time, totaling 545 people. The training courses are all basic, such as mechanics, radio, and surveying. The ships donated by the U.S. Navy not only belong entirely to the Chinese Navy, but also to the UNRRA's various Chinese shipping companies and the Maritime Customs. The 1,000 Chinese naval students trained in Miami, USA, sailed back this time with two aircraft carrier escorts and two destroyers. The U.S. donated four medium landing ships, five army landing ships, seven amphibious tanks, and thirty small boats to the Chinese Navy. Five landing ships, fifteen medium landing ships, eight small landing ships, and five port auxiliary boats were handed over to Chinese shipping merchants. UNRRA also received sixteen medium landing ships, twenty landing ships, five destroyer escorts, and one hundred and twenty-three small boats. The Customs also received eight minesweepers, six small minesweepers, two army landing ships, and about twenty other ships.

Finally, General Cooke stated that the U.S. naval vessels will be gradually withdrawn to Qingdao or returned to the United States, but Qingdao "is not a U.S. naval base," and the flagship of the Seventh Fleet will remain stationed in Qingdao.
There is always a surge in prices during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but in the past, prices would always fall back after September. This year, the prices are rising without falling, which is an exception. In addition, the coal industry is allocated by the Central Fuel Management Committee, and the official price has not risen. Why is the black market price so high? The municipal government can take appropriate measures to stabilize prices. However, when there is a simple path to follow, we do not intend to use pressure. We hope that various trade associations can automatically assist the government and not increase the difficulty of governance. Today's meeting is a symposium to find out the reasons for price increases in various industries and jointly review them to find a solution.

Flour
Gu Zhunian, Chairman of the Flour Industry Association, stated the reasons for the price increase, saying: There are more than 70 member companies in the trade association that can be allocated flour, and another 100 or so small stores are allocated. Among them, the maximum amount allocated is 50 or 60 bags, and the minimum amount is 20 or 30 bags, while the monthly sales volume is 15,000 or 16,000 bags, so the actual supply is not enough for the market. The government had a one-year tax exemption plan, and now the tax exemption period expires in September. Starting today, a 15 per cent business tax will be levied. Recently, transportation costs have increased, so it seems difficult to stabilize the price of flour in the future. Mayor Wu immediately replied that the business tax was decided by the central government and could not be arbitrarily adjusted locally, but the municipal government would try to waive it.

Coal
The Chairman of the Coal Industry Association said: To stabilize coal prices, it is necessary to open up sources. Currently, the city's bituminous coal is allocated by the Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan. The city's coal industry association only receives 5,000 tons per month, which is not enough for distribution. To suppress the black market, it is necessary to open up sources. The problem now is not that there is no coal, but that there are no ships. We hope that the government will allocate ships to load coal in Kailuan, Haifang, and other places. The Coal Industry Association has restricted the legal profits of its members to no more than 20%. A representative of the Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan said that fuel prices have soared recently, but bituminous coal prices have not risen. Bituminous coal is allocated by them and will maintain previous prices. In addition, the raw materials for coal briquettes have not risen, so the price of coal briquettes has not risen today. The total amount of coal allocated by the committee each month is 200,000 tons, and the amount of coal used by the city's public utilities, such as the power company, gas company, and water company, is 40,000 to 50,000 tons, which accounts for a quarter of the total. Moreover, coal from Hankou, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Qingdao, and other places must also be distributed by Shanghai, so the committee also feels that it is really difficult to make ends meet. The government has been trying its best to open up sources, and ships are regularly sent to various places to purchase.

Cloth Industry
The representative of the Cloth Industry Association stated that the two main reasons for the current increase in cloth prices are: (1) There is insufficient stock. Before the war, the city had 10 million bolts of cotton cloth in stock, which were later purchased by the Japanese. (2) The season is approaching autumn, and citizens need cloth urgently. People in the countryside are more stable in their lives, so they are buying cloth in groups. Recently, 600,000 bolts have been shipped to the Northeast. Production is insufficient, so the increase in cloth prices is passive. The association has repeatedly tried to stabilize prices. The representative of the Woolen Yarn Industry Association said that due to the impact of rumors, it has been rumored in the market recently that foreign exchange will be adjusted again, and the weather is getting colder, so citizens are buying enthusiastically, and there are few sources, so supply is less than demand, creating a situation of scarcity. After various trade associations complained about their plight,

Du Yuesheng Expresses His Opinion
Du Yuesheng began by saying: Mayor Wu has been most concerned about the prices in the city since taking office, but what is really closely related to citizens are daily necessities such as rice, oil, coal, cloth, and sugar. As long as the prices of these major items do not rise, there will be no serious impact on people's livelihood, so the mayor's stabilization of prices can be based on this principle. The mayor immediately expressed great agreement with Du's opinion and said that the municipal government and the responsible persons of various associations have regular contact, which can ensure that prices will not rise. However, the mayor believes that the cotton cloth industry, the coal industry, and the woolen yarn industry also have a direct impact on citizens, so it was decided that the Social Affairs Bureau and representatives of the relevant trade associations will organize a price review committee to ensure that various industries enter the right track and do not take any excessive actions, lest the authorities take action to ban them. Finally, Shi Zhidang, the representative of the Western Medicine Industry Association, reported on the current situation of the industry, and the meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.

Fourteen Groups Hold Garden Party and Reception to Entertain U.S. Military Dependents Today

Former Japan Beer Company; Kong Xiangxi Purchases
[Report from this newspaper] The "Great Japan Beer Company," formerly established by the Japanese in Hongkou, was auctioned by the Enemy and Puppet Assets Processing Bureau to the "China-America Soda Company." However, because the land was owned by Kong Xiangxi, a dispute arose. The councillors raised questions in the council. The processing bureau only auctioned the factory's production equipment, not including the land. Kong did not want to rent the land to the China-America Soda Company, but wanted to buy the factory. The China-America authorities have agreed to transfer it. The price is still under negotiation.

Director of Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan Talks About Levying Various Taxes; Increasing Entertainment Tax Is Inevitable; Municipal Construction Donation Will Be Postponed Until Next Month
Director of Finance Bureau, Gu Chunfan, told reporters yesterday: The entertainment tax rate will be increased to 50%. Once the official notice from the City Council arrives, it will be implemented. Although representatives of the entertainment industry came to the bureau to petition a few days ago, I told them that the increase in the tax rate was decided by the City Council. Only one person expressed opposition when this case was discussed at the meeting, and the rest of the councillors raised their hands in favor, so the increase in the tax rate is inevitable and cannot be changed by petitioning the bureau. When asked whether the entertainment tax on dramas would also be increased in the same way as other entertainment taxes, Gu said: The drama tax is currently 38%. The drama tax was not increased in the previous tax increase. If the official notice sent by the City Council to the bureau this time does not have clear provisions on the drama tax, the City Finance Bureau may not consider whether to increase the donation rate in the same way as cinemas. According to Gu's estimation, after the entertainment donation increases, the tax amount can be increased to 2.1 billion yuan per month. Mr. Wen said: The Finance Bureau originally set the amount for starting the levy of the banquet donation at 1,000 yuan, but now it is considering raising it to 2,000 yuan. Customer meals in hotels and restaurants that cost less than 2,000 yuan will not be levied. This new regulation will be implemented within a few days after being approved by the municipal meeting. Regarding the collection of municipal construction donations, the Finance Bureau has stipulated the calculation and collection methods for the donation tax. Within one or two days, a survey of the actual rent of each house will begin for all households in the city to determine the exact amount of house donation that the landlord should bear and pay. The Finance Bureau will collect it from the tenants together with the municipal construction donation, and then the tenants will deduct it from the rent.

Calculation Method of Municipal Construction Donation
In order to understand the collection and calculation method of the municipal construction donation, the reporter also visited He Jiayu, the section chief of the House Donation Section of the bureau. According to him, the rents of the houses in the city were estimated by the former Public Concession Bureau and the French Municipal Council in 1937. Now that prices have soared in the past nine years, the houses in the city are divided into three grades, and the total amount of the autumn house donation is increased by several times according to the 1937 rent value as follows: For Grade A houses, those with an estimated annual rent value of more than 1,800 yuan in 1937 will be calculated at 100 times the estimated rent. For Grade B houses, those with an estimated annual rent value of more than 1,000 yuan and less than 1,800 yuan in 1937 will be calculated at 75 times. For Grade C houses, those with an estimated annual rent of less than 1,000 yuan in 1937 will be calculated at 50 times. For example, for a house with a monthly rent of 25 yuan and an annual rent of 300 yuan before the war (Grade B), the amount of donations to be collected in the autumn will be 15,000 yuan (i.e., 300 multiplied by 50 times), but this is the total amount of the autumn house donation and municipal construction donation combined. Calculated separately, the house donation should be 20% of the actual rent collected, which should be borne by the landlord, and the rest is for municipal construction, which is borne by the tenant. For example, for the house with an annual rent of 300 yuan before the war, the actual rent is now 10,000 yuan per month. The landlord should pay 20% of the house donation each month (i.e., 2,000 yuan), and 6,000 yuan for the house donation per quarter. The autumn donation is 15,000 yuan. After deducting the house donation of 6,000 yuan, the remaining 9,000 yuan is the municipal construction donation borne by the tenant this quarter. From this, it can be seen that the amount of municipal construction donation is inversely proportional to the house donation. The higher the rent, the higher the house donation, and the less the municipal construction donation paid by the tenant.

Survey of Rent to Determine the Exact Amount
As for the total amount of the winter house donation and the municipal construction donation, it will be calculated by doubling the amount in autumn, but the house donation part is still 20% of the actual rent. The bureau will start surveying the actual rent paid by the residents of the city this week. The survey forms have been printed and must be filled out and mailed to the bureau by October 20 to determine the amount of house donation that the landlord should collect. If there are a large number of tenants living in one house, the form should be filled out by the second landlord who sublets the house and report the rent received by the main landlord. The third tenants do not need to fill it out. In the future, when the collection starts, the municipal construction donation and the house donation will be combined into one form, called the "Municipal Construction Donation and House Donation Payment Form." This donation tax will all be paid by the tenant first, and then deducted from the rent paid to the landlord. As for the start of the collection of the municipal construction donation, due to the time spent on investigation and preparation, and the valuation work of the houses in Nanshi Zhabei has not yet been completed, the start of the collection will be postponed until mid-November. It is estimated that the total revenue from the municipal construction donation in autumn and winter will be about 20 billion yuan.

A Rich Young Man Troubled by His Wife
[Report from this newspaper] Zhuang Honggao, a Ningbo native, 48 years old, the owner of the Hengdeli Clock and Watch Shop and Daming Glasses Company on Nanjing Road, lives at 47 Futian Village, Beijing West Road. He has a concubine who lives at 53 Mingde Lane, Avenue Foch. Zhuang has a son named Zhiguo, who is young and dashing and often frequents singing and dancing halls. In February 1940, he officially married Liu (24 years old) at the Xindu Hotel and lived together in Room 35, Peien Apartments, 2 Rue Luber. Five years after the marriage, Liu had three daughters, the eldest named Biru, the second Bichan, and the youngest Biting. However, the relationship between the couple was cold. Years ago, Zhiguo met a dancer named Dong Ai'e (also known as Zheng Miaoyun) at the Metropole Dance Hall and rented a house at Dahua Apartments, Jing'an Temple Road. Liu found out about this and caught them in the act last December. She took Dong and her husband Zhiguo to the District Attorney's Office. In the end, because of the relationship between husband and wife, she did not want to pursue the matter excessively and only ordered Zhiguo to write a letter of repentance and sever all relations with Dong forever. The matter was then dropped. Unexpectedly, Zhiguo could not forget his old love and continued to be passionately in love with Dong. He went there again in July of this year, but the apartment had been leased by Dong to another dancer, Wang Juan, so he did not get the result. Recently, Liu began to find out where her husband and Dong were living together, which was also in Room 24 of Peien Apartments. She invited lawyer Chen Zhen to report to the Lujiiawan Police Station on the night before last. The police were dispatched to catch them in the act. Zhuang and Dong were in the same room and were arrested. After being taken to the police station, Liu insisted on sending them to the District Attorney's Office. Yesterday, they were sent to the District Attorney's Office. After an investigation, Zhiguo invited lawyer Song Yaogi to request bail. Prosecutor Ding then ordered Zhuang and Dong to each pay a bond of 10 million yuan and await summons.

Seagoing Vessels Ordered; Arrive in Shanghai One After Another
[Report from this newspaper] The Taikoo Company's Nanchang ship, which was carrying relief supplies to North China from Hong Kong, was delayed until today due to avoiding the wind. It is scheduled to sail north tomorrow. It will not load any more cargo or passengers in Shanghai. The Dutch firm Java Company's Zeeschouw Denie was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today from Java. It was learned yesterday that it would be delayed until the 11th of this month before it could arrive in port, and it is scheduled to return to Batavia on the 13th. The Norwegian ship Sumerverl, which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on Sunday of this week to return to the United States, could not depart on time due to insufficient unloading and a large amount of export cargo. It has now been changed to export on the 12th. The American firm Foremost Shipping Company has expanded its shipping business greatly since resuming operations after the victory. In addition to its own ships, it also acts as an agent for ships carrying relief supplies and coal, no less than one hundred ships. The original office space was insufficient, so it has moved to the fifth floor of the North China Daily News Building to work. The telephone has also increased by three lines (12992 to 4).

The Material Supply Bureau. Seven seagoing vessels purchased in Canada, Hai and Hai have been received by China Merchants. Haihang will also be received. Haihan arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying 20,000 sleepers from Vancouver, which are currently being unloaded. Hailu will also arrive in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month. Haijin and Haiyu are also on their way to Shanghai. Winter is approaching; Actively Preparing Shelters for the Cold
[Report from this newspaper] Since the Social Affairs Bureau's Ninth Section ended the shelters for the cold last spring, many refugees have lost relief. Autumn has now entered, and winter is approaching. The establishment of shelters for the cold this year should be actively prepared. It is heard that it has been decided to hold at least ten shelters for the cold this year, accommodating 5,000 people. However, due to the serious housing shortage in the city, it is not easy to find suitable places for a while. Personnel are currently being dispatched to contact them separately. It is expected that reception can begin in mid-next month.

U.S. Army Logistics Headquarters Abolished; Gillem Flies to Beiping Today to Succeed as U.S. Member of the Military Mediation Department; Holds Farewell Press Conference Yesterday
[Report from this newspaper] Lieutenant General Gillem, Commander of the U.S. Army in China, will fly to Beiping today to succeed Robertson as the U.S. member of the Military Mediation Department. Yesterday afternoon at 4:15, he held a farewell press conference on the 11th floor of Hu Ma Apartment.

Lieutenant General Gillem first described his experience in Shanghai. He then said that the U.S. Army in China will establish two institutions in China in the future, one is the Beiping Military Mediation Department Executive Group, and the other is the Nanjing U.S. Military Advisory Group in China. These two institutions are established independently, and all supplies are separate. However, important cases must still be approved by Marshal Marshall.

The biggest task of the U.S. Army Headquarters in China is to assist China in evacuating Japanese troops. A total of 2.2 million people have been evacuated, and there are still about 24,000 technical personnel, etc. It is expected that all of them will be repatriated before January next year. There are about 15,000 Japanese troops in North China. After the transportation work in Central China and South China is completed, they will continue to be repatriated, and the Northeast will also begin at the same time.

The U.S. Army Logistics Headquarters in Shanghai will be abolished from today, but a small number of personnel under the direction of Colonel Kooney will remain here to continue to complete the search for missing U.S. airmen and transport U.S. military supplies. The U.S. military court's trial of Japanese war criminals is expected to be completed within two months. In addition, 27 German spies are being tried.

In addition to the U.S. Information Service, there is also a semi-official agency, the Foreign Surplus Property Clearance Committee, hosted by its representative in China, Mr. Hobbs. According to the Sino-U.S. agreement, the materials must be guarded by the U.S. military for 60 days before they are cleared.

Finally, some Soviet reporters asked Lieutenant General Gillem about the incident in which 20 U.S. soldiers beat two Russians last time. Lieutenant General Gillem said that the matter is being investigated closely by Mr. Davis, the U.S. Consul in Shanghai. He also said that when people of two different nationalities meet, misunderstandings often occur due to language barriers and different customs. However, the perpetrators, regardless of their nationality, should be punished.

Russian Confesses to the Crime of Killing His Wife
[Report from this newspaper] The tenant, Russian Duminov, at 69 Zhao Zhujiao Road on the second floor, stabbed his wife, Inusova, to death with a butcher knife at about 10:00 AM on the 28th of last month. Afterwards, Du went to the Changshu Road Police Station to falsely report that his wife had been murdered in the kitchen of the pavilion. Director Zhao of the Zhao Branch sent Judicial Section Chief Wang Duanhong and Section Member Li Dacheng to investigate. It was believed that Du was a major suspect and was taken to the police station for temporary detention. Du was burly, wearing a U.S. military uniform, and had a small mustache. He had been a detective at the French police station for many years and was extremely cunning. He always denied killing his wife. In the detention center for a day and night, he had no grief. After Section Chief Wang interrogated him for two days and nights, he confessed everything and admitted to stabbing his wife to death. According to his confession, his wife was greedy for petty gains and often rented rooms to the U.S. Navy for secret meetings. He resented this and their relationship was not harmonious. At the time of the incident, his wife was holding a sharp knife to cut beef. She had swung the knife to kill Du, and Du seized the knife and killed her. Afterwards, in order to blame others, he deliberately messed up the clothes in the house to pretend to be robbed. After going out, he went to several friends' houses before going to the police station to make a false report in the afternoon. Du also added two points: (1) He met his friend Gao Wencao as soon as he went out, at 11:10, and Gao's statement of 10:15 was a mistake.

The Autumn Battlefield of the Tuo River and Si River
This Newspaper's Gucheng Dispatch, September 15th, Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

Having concluded my journey along the Huai River, I rode swiftly between the Tuo and Si Rivers, paying homage to the current battlefield and spending this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.

On Mid-Autumn Day, there was no moonlight before midnight, dark clouds covered the sky, and autumn rain drizzled. Local residents slaughtered pigs to犒勞 the troops amidst the ruins. Soldiers played the dongxiao, its sound mournful, causing those who missed home to weep.

A cool breeze arose from the horizon, military bugles wailed, the deer antlers formed a menacing array, the sound of hooves came and went like a sudden rain, rising and falling amidst desolate villages and wild trees. The barking of dogs was faintly heard, while the roar of car engines was like thunder. Looking from a high place, the earth was vast and indistinct, without a single spark of light, only the grass beside my feet whispered a sorrowful autumn song. This is the modern battlefield!

Ten Thousand Heartbreaks, a Song of Gaixia

Fifty li south of Lingbi County lies Haochengji, the ancient Gaixia. It was here that Han Xin defeated Xiang Yu. Surrounded by the songs of Chu on all sides, the hero wept. Yet, Xiang Yu did not fail as a hero, and Consort Yu's suicide by sword only amplified the sentiment of bravery through the ages. Along the Lingbi-Si County road lies the tomb of Consort Yu, a desolate mound overgrown with autumn grass, but there is no lack of those who come to mourn throughout history. Su Zhe, in his elegy for Consort Yu's tomb, wrote: "Bu rebelled, Zeng died, the state was already in ruins, Yu has exhausted himself from now until the end, enduring hardship alone with Consort Yu, who allowed the enemy from the west, Liu Bang, to come?" Showing a sense of indignation. But Su Dongpo was different, writing: "The beauty under the tent wipes away her tears, the brave warrior before the gate has an aura like clouds; not betraying the monarch's will in haste, only Consort Yu and Zheng Jun." Giving much praise. However, after Empress Lü Zhi of Han died, her tomb was desecrated by the Chimei, truly incomparable.

During his peak, Xiang Yu returned from Qi and defeated Liu Bang's 560,000 troops at Pengcheng, pursuing them to the banks of the Sui River, where the Han army was annihilated and the Sui River was blocked by corpses. During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Cao attacked Xuzhou and conquered Tao Qian, capturing Suqian and Sining. In Lingbi, he massacred tens of thousands of men and women, leaving no chickens or dogs, and the Si River ceased to flow. This event is recorded in the Later Han Dynasty History. Yet, it is not as well-known as the Three Massacres of Yangzhou. Is it because the Chinese people are accustomed to slaughtering each other? This is one of China's secrets.

Ancient battlefields, modern battlefields, everywhere with bullet holes and bloodstains, people killed filling the fields, reflecting on the past, ten thousand kinds of heartache! The people are constantly suffering from war, locusts, and floods. When the army passes through, they are forced to provide labor, carriages, and supplies, weary of coping. When the Communist army was here, they put forward the slogan "For the People," but in the end, everything was "For the Communist Army." Where the reporter passed, the National Army had only taken over from the Communist army for just over a month, and everywhere was desolate, with weeds growing wild, no roads in the wilderness, and no complete houses in the villages, with more uninhabited houses. All of this was not directly destroyed by the previous month's war, but rather was the legacy of the Communist army's presence. The people also lacked political trust in the Communist army, being led in meetings, struggles, and purges day and night, with no peace in their minds, no peace in their days, and no peace in their months. Even though the Communist Party's border region government, county magistrates, and other personnel were subjectively eager to approach the masses, the people could not bear the poverty and took to fleeing en masse.

When the reporter crossed the Tuo River eastward, he encountered a group of farmers returning to their hometown from Gucheng after fleeing for half a year. These dozen or so people were neither landlords nor small landowners, but rather hired laborers who were "so poor they had no land to stand on." When asked why they had fled, they replied: "Are we afraid of not having food? Every day there are meetings and struggles, and we are forced to become enemies with our bosses. Who can bear such hardship? Seeing that things were not right, we fled to Gucheng to set up stalls and do odd jobs to make a living." Their homes were dilapidated, the war was still raging, and they did not know when they would be able to find stability.

The Ruined City of Lingbi, Grass Over the Knees

West of Lingbi lies the Tuo River, where the National and Communist armies confronted each other across the river for twelve months. Guerrilla warfare and patrols were common in the area. However, the Tuo River remained in the hands of the National Army, surrounded by earthen walls with numerous gun holes. The houses were intact, the autumn willows leaned over the water, full of the charm unique to the northern countryside. Villagers carried pears, blocking the road to sell them, the same variety as the Dangshan pears, asking only a hundred yuan per jin.

The highway from Gucheng to Lingbi, 85 li long, was originally a gravel road. After ten years of disrepair, and with the recent frequent traffic of vehicles and horses, heavy rain would turn it into mud that submerged the ankles, completely blocking traffic. The local government then mobilized the people to repair it, but only to the extent of digging earth and filling in the gaps, which could not withstand the erosion of rainwater. In late summer and early autumn this year, frequent rainfall meant that repairs had to be done after every rain, causing the people great hardship.

Lingbi and Sixian counties had been occupied by the Japanese army for many years. After Japan surrendered, the government sent personnel to take over. The Communist army then attacked Lingbi after Sixian on August 20, claiming it was to accept the surrender, but in reality, the Japanese army had already concentrated in Bengbu, and the puppet army was ordered to garrison after surrendering, hence the fighting. In July of this year, the National Army successively captured Sixian and Lingbi. The Communist army, in conjunction with the Lingbi County Self-Defense Brigade, and the puppet army once counterattacked Sixian, resulting in fierce battles. The Communist army suffered as many as ten thousand casualties.

The National Army captured Lingbi and Sixian by following the Gucheng-Sixian highway that the reporter took, crossing the Tuo River on July 17 and advancing eastward. County Magistrate Tang Kenan, transferred from Qingyang, took office in Gucheng on the 16th and headed east the next day. Gradually making contact, on the 21st, they forced the Communist army to its final stronghold, Phoenix Mountain. On the 22nd, they attacked with heavy artillery at dawn, and the Communist army collapsed, thus capturing Lingbi. When the National Army entered the city, there were only fourteen civilians in the city, and grass grew knee-deep in many streets. The Communist army had originally planned to implement a scorched earth policy and destroy the entire city, but the National Army engineers worked for a week and dug out a large number of homemade landmines and giant wooden-handled stick grenades (also a type of landmine) in various places, which the Communist army had not had time to detonate due to their hasty retreat.

When the reporter arrived in Lingbi, the National Army had advanced continuously and had already replaced the city defense commander seven times. The people gradually returned, but the five thousand people who had returned were only one-tenth of the pre-war population. Although order was stable, the Communist county government and commissioner were located fifty li away, so villagers coming to the city to trade could only do so outside the city.

The city walls of Lingbi were extremely strong, with stone foundations and crenellations, over three zhang high, relics of the Qing Dynasty. When the Communist army occupied Lingbi last year, they conscripted ten thousand people, who brought their own pots and pans and food, and spent fifteen days and nights destroying them. Now only a circle of earthen mounds remains, full of bricks and stones. Other temples and monasteries inside and outside the city were also demolished, including the Christian church, for reasons that are truly inexplicable. The remaining houses in Lingbi are mostly thatched huts with earthen steps, reminiscent of ancient times. It is said that Xu Shen, the author of Shuowen Jiezi in the Later Han Dynasty, once governed here. Entering this dilapidated ancient city, thinking of the great scholar of writing, I wonder if Xu Shen completed his great work here?

Listening to Folk Songs at the Foot of Phoenix Mountain

Phoenix Mountain is located five li northwest of the city, a high mound of slate, over thirty meters high, without trees, with bunkers on top, which the Communist army had guarded. The reporter climbed the mountain and saw only bullet holes everywhere. The bunkers were also destroyed by bombing at that time, but have now been repaired, and the surrounding area is surrounded by chevaux de frise, made from cut trees. From here, one can see Mount Mao Yi, forty li away, still within Lingbi County. The Communist commissioner and the county magistrates of Su, Wu, Tong, and Xiao counties are stationed in the northeast and northwest areas of the city, levying grain and expanding the army, planning for a comeback. Most of the young people in that area have fled to Lingbi County. Lingbi has suffered severe flooding, and the area forty li northwest of Phoenix Mountain has become an inland lake. Recently, the water level has receded slightly, and the ochre-colored land can be seen emerging from the water. The Communist army has apparently received orders not to withdraw from its original controlled area.

The gain or loss of Phoenix Mountain determines the gain or loss of Lingbi. From the top of the mountain, Lingbi can be seen like a map in the palm of one's hand. At that time, the artillery fire was fierce, and the residents at the foot of the mountain fled eastward. The Communist army had spread propaganda about how the National Army was killing, setting fire to, hoping to make the people follow them, but as soon as the Communist army retreated and the artillery fire stopped, the people returned to their homes one after another. The foot of Phoenix Mountain was originally fertile land, each mu yielding 300 jin of wheat and sorghum, but now weeds are rampant, and it has not been cultivated for a year.

There is a folk song in northern Anhui that says: "Hoping for the Central Government, waiting for the Central Government, the Central Government comes and sweeps everything away; rather have the Central Government sweep everything away, than have the Eighth Route Army call us 'Auntie'."

Meaning that when the National Army comes, there will inevitably be war. Once the war starts, the houses will be reduced to ruins and swept away, which is conceivable, but this can still hope for stability, avoiding the Communist army coming to the door and calling us "Auntie" (a polite term), causing trouble with struggles. This kind of sentiment is extremely painful. The Chinese people today seek stability but cannot obtain it! A woman from Xiaozhang Village explained the meaning of this folk song to the reporter and said, "Not to mention calling us 'Auntie', as soon as they come, they borrow whatever they want, they even kowtow to you, but later when the struggles start, they want your head at every turn. It's really scary!

Xiaozhang Village is located at the foot of the mountain. A dozen pomegranate trees in front of the village were cut down by the National Army to be used as chevaux de frise for auxiliary fortifications, which the villagers all regretted. A weaving worker surnamed Wang, from Yanzhou, Shandong, came to Xiaozhang Village at the age of nineteen and is now forty-nine years old, but still speaks pure Yanzhou dialect. He said to the reporter: "I don't have any fields or land. When the devils came, I stopped working and loafed around, picking grass and helping people with odd jobs. That's how I barely managed to feed myself. When the Eighth Route Army came, they made it impossible to say anything, always having meetings for no reason. How can we farmers have the time for that? Inciting you to fight this person or that person, even something as small as an egg has to be fought over for half a day. For example, they ask me if someone has borrowed something from me. I think and think, and remember that this person borrowed an egg from me a long time ago. Then that's terrible, they want me to fight him. They even control what we eat and wear. You can't wear or eat anything good, they won't let you have any peace. But the Eighth Route Army, they eat well and grow fat, and no one says anything about that."

Key to Solving the Land Problem in Northern Jiangsu in the Future, A Sunday Forum Article by Wang Suzhen

In the August 11th edition of the Shen Bao Sunday Forum, I read Mr. Ge Kexin's "The Northern Jiangsu Land Problem Urgently Awaiting Resolution." I feel this is a crucial issue in dealing with the rural areas of Northern Jiangsu, worthy of attention and discussion.

From the Northern Jiangsu refugees demanding to return to their hometowns to negotiations for the CCP to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu, from the New Fourth Army's hasty implementation of "Land Reform" in Northern Jiangsu to Secretary Marshall's statement that it was the most difficult problem to solve! The CCP's refusal to relinquish local political power indicates that the Northern Jiangsu problem is extremely serious. It also makes us think of the crux of the Northern Jiangsu problem – the land problem.

China is an agricultural country, and Northern Jiangsu specifically reflects the conditions of China's rural areas. All economic life depends on agricultural products. Naturally, the land problem, which affects the lives of farmers, is the main problem "urgently awaiting resolution" in this area.

After Madam Sun Yat-sen raised the idea of the "Kuomintang must implement its historical task—land reform" in her "Opinions on the Current Situation," apologists for the CCP even said that Northern Jiangsu had already implemented "land reform," farmers had already obtained land, and propagandized how the livelihood of the people in Northern Jiangsu had been improved and how close the relationship was between the people of Northern Jiangsu and the local "democratic government." They told wildly exaggerated stories that sounded very plausible!

In reality, the CCP's "land reform" in Northern Jiangsu was a serious mistake in both theory and style, and suffered an undeniable failure.

Because Ge Guang-sheng "could not deeply penetrate the CCP-controlled areas and thus could not learn the details" regarding the "land reform" of "land distribution based on population ratios," the author, being from Northern Jiangsu, "penetrated" into the "areas once controlled by the CCP" as the military situation in Northern Jiangsu shifted, and only then learned the truth about the local "land distribution." The details are described below:

When the "New Fourth Army Government" announced the so-called "Improve People's Livelihood Land Reform Plan," it dispatched "work teams" to the countryside at any time, convened all militia cadres, elected "Emancipated People's Representatives," and then convened a village meeting to bring the landlords of this village to account for old debts. The accounting method was very peculiar! In addition to tenants reversing rent and hired workers reversing wages, a beggar who begged in front of the landlord's door and had his begging bowl broken by a member of the landlord's family, a tenant farmer who supplied three fried eggs when the landlord went to the countryside, and the landlord's dog who fought with other dogs and trampled a seedling in someone else's field… The so-called "wanting to condemn someone, there's always an excuse." Under these messy "accusation hats," all the landlord's fields and properties, according to the compound interest method, were not enough to pay back even if they were all handed over. The "Emancipated People's Representative" then told him (the landlord) to first take out the field deed to offset these "debts" above. If the landlord protested or defended himself, or said that the old deed was lost, he was immediately considered a "stubborn element" or a "sabotage element" and forced to kneel on the roof and "look toward the old Central Government." If they could not be forced to come out after half a day, then all kinds of "democratic" tortures were used until the landlord could not bear the pain and handed over the field deed, or admitted that all his property was handed over, and he was "willing" to beg for a living to end it. As for the landlords' fields and lands that had fled elsewhere, the "democratic government" determined the "crime" to be confiscated, or the landlord's fields were adjacent to the landlord and sold on their behalf. Landlords' fields were calculated, and then the "work team" convened a large meeting of the "masses" in the village, explaining that everyone had settled old debts, and the poor had been liberated. But this was a "victory of the people," and everyone had to "fairly distribute the fruits of victory." The beggar who had broken a begging bowl and was compensated with dozens of acres of land had to take out his "property" and distribute it to everyone; as a result, land was distributed on average according to the land area and population density of each village. In the so-called "first district," each person at most received two and a half acres of land, and at least one acre and seven or eight tenths of an acre of land. After the field boundaries were measured, the person distributing the land designated the grain that the person who received the land had to hand over. Tenants who had cultivated dozens of acres of land had to give up the grain in the fields they had worked so hard to cultivate to others to harvest. These tenants not only did not receive the "fruits of victory," but some of them suffered losses that exceeded the amount of rent they had paid to the landlord. As for the impact of land distribution on independent farmers, middle peasants, and rich peasants, it goes without saying.

In theory, the CCP once solemnly swore to abandon "land revolution" and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People. Mao Zedong also sang the praises of "New Democracy," implementing rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and increasing wages. In Mr. Huang Yanpei's book "Return from Yan'an," it was said that Mao Zedong also discovered that the old Party jargon and foreign jargon were not correct, and that farmers did not necessarily need land, as long as they had land to cultivate. Farmers sometimes need to borrow money for economic turnover, so there are still landlords in Yan'an. Yan'an advocates rent reduction and interest rate reduction, but guarantees rent and interest payment. Whether the situation in Yan'an is like this, the author does not know. However, the CCP in Northern Jiangsu has now overturned all the promises and declarations of Yan'an, causing people to doubt the "words" and "deeds" of the Communist Party. At the same time, in the implementation of policies, the CCP has received a high tide of dissatisfaction from the entire Northern Jiangsu farmers.

Some writers who live in foreign houses in Shanghai and specialize in creating revolutionary theories may ask: Isn't it much better for farmers to get land than not to get land? After this improvement, farmers should be ecstatic. How can there be any dissatisfaction?

This is because those writers do not experience the actual situation and only know how to be arbitrary, and they are suffering from the same disease as the CCP's resolute "doing." May I ask: (1) Can farmers who receive one acre and seven or eight tenths of an acre of land per person already have enough food and clothing? (2) Has land been evenly distributed when one village receives one acre and seven or eight tenths of an acre of land per person, and another village receives two and a half acres of land per person? (3) The so-called realization of "tillers have their land," we will not take care of the landlords who do not farm for the time being, but those self-cultivators, middle peasants, and rich peasants all farm, their lives were originally well-off, but now their lives are insufficient. Will they be satisfied with a kind of "improvement" that has been wantonly imposed on them?

Or someone will say: In the past, when the land was not distributed, everyone could still get by. Now that all the landlords' land has been distributed, everyone can't get by, and their lives are insufficient. Why is that? If we count the current population and land area of Northern Jiangsu and conduct an in-depth investigation of the rural economic situation, we will know that although Northern Jiangsu is still a rural village with an agricultural economy, due to the rapid increase in the farmer population, it can no longer rely entirely on agricultural products, but needs industry, commerce, and transportation to develop outwards.

To give a few examples: In a certain village that the author visited, a certain household did not cultivate much land, and there were several young men in the family. This family only left two men to cultivate the land at home, and the rest went to the town and to distant places to work in industry and commerce, working as helpers. A certain household did not cultivate enough land for the whole family to eat. This family sailed to various places to do business, pulled rickshaws in Shanghai, and worked as short-term laborers in Jiangnan to make up for the annual food shortage. There are many other complex situations, but in short, it is not entirely reliant on "self-cultivation" to solve life, but a widespread situation.

So, let's study the CCP's "land distribution" situation. According to the population of each village, how much land will be given to you to cultivate. As for the result of "distribution according to the population of each village," no matter how many people you have, whether there is enough land or not, it will be "evenly distributed" to you, that's it. There is a tenant farmer with six people in his household, including his wife, son, and daughter-in-law. His family cultivated sixty acres of land. According to the payment of rent, fertilizer, and seeds in previous years, they could net seventy or eighty dan of grain every year, enough for the family to live comfortably. After this year's "land distribution," he only got ten acres of land and zero, and after paying the public grain, it is estimated that he would only get more than twenty dan of grain. His life suddenly "deteriorated." In addition to this year's wheat harvest, he exchanged more fertilizer and seeds, and cultivated fifty more acres of land for those who distributed land to him for nothing. The so-called "democratic government" that takes care of the working class has given the farmers a heavy blow, and the response it has received from the broad masses of people is an expression of dissatisfaction.

Although the "democratic government" of the "New Fourth Army" has forced "doing" in such an undemocratic way, have we not heard that in the villages of Gaoyou, Qutang, Haian, Rugao, and other places, the torches of rebellion are continuing to burn? Are not these flames of liberation being fueled by "democratic good governance"?

Furthermore, in terms of style, all "settling accounts" and "reversing rent" have simply become rogue methods of extortion, completely disregarding propriety, justice, integrity, shame, morality, and law. The government does not guide the people to abide by the "law," but guides the people to make "trouble." May I ask what country in the world has a social organization that only needs trouble and does not need governance? This point, I am afraid that the CCP, in its ten thousand times of cover-up of Northern Jiangsu, also has to admit that "some cadres have made mistakes in their style"! However, these "mistakes" have already been made in the "starting point of the upper leadership." Just imagine, without the same open "guidance" from above, which Chinese would invent from nothing that someone had eaten three of his eggs in the past, and now he had to settle back dozens of acres of land?

No matter what the historical lessons are, this time the CCP's "land distribution" measures in Northern Jiangsu have suffered an undeniable failure! The CCP's failed experiment in Northern Jiangsu is also a lesson for "the Kuomintang must carry out its historical task—land reform."

We should know that the Communist Party's "reform" is because it has not seen the crux of the problem; what we urgently need to study now is where its crux lies. From the CCP's failure, we can draw the following conclusions:

(1) Farmers' expectations are not so much in the distribution of land as in the distribution of enough grain to live on.

(2) Farmers' demands are not in how fair the distribution of land is, but in finding ways to increase grain harvests so that everyone's lives are not short of.

(3) Farmers need to do their best and take what they need, but they are unwilling to have their hopes of free upward development restricted by others.

Based on the above points, we should pay attention to: How to improve the tenancy system in Northern Jiangsu? How should the land law restricting land concentration be implemented? How should agricultural technology to improve farms and increase production be actively promoted?

First, let's talk about the tenancy system. In China, whether in Northern Jiangsu or other rural areas, there have always been many unreasonable situations. Now the government is implementing a 25% rent reduction, which will naturally reduce the burden on tenants a lot. We hope that governments at all levels in all places can implement this earnestly and quickly. At the same time, local governments should strictly prohibit various systems of exploitation and oppression by landlords, such as "fixed rent" (paying rent to the landlord regardless of whether the year is good or bad) and "advance rent" (paying the rent in advance, regardless of whether there is a harvest or not).

Regarding restricting land concentration, I very much agree with Mr. Ge's proposal to "levy land rent income tax on excess land at a progressive rate… For excessive amounts, the government will issue land bonds and selectively buy a part." Excessive land concentration increases the negative forces of landlords' exploitation and oppression. At the same time, landlords "wear taxes and eat rent," indulging in leisure and reducing the forces of social progress. May I ask, how many landlords in Northern Jiangsu with three or four hundred mu to thousands of mu of land, in addition to calculating rent every year, have promoted the improvement of farms or abandoned land to invest in factory industries to benefit their hometowns and build their motherland? Therefore, I think that only if the government uses the above two methods to oppress the landlords, so that they reduce their interest in land and pay attention to investing in industry and commerce. In this way, land will not be concentrated in the hands of landlords for a long time, and the goal of "tillers have their land" will be achieved.

As for improving agriculture, it is even more urgent. Sun Yat-sen once said: "China does not have big capitalists, only big poor and small poor. China's problem lies in ignorance, poverty, and weakness." Yes, the "poor" and backward situation of rural areas like Northern Jiangsu is because it still uses the old-fashioned "ignorant" method of cultivation. Therefore, on that vast fertile field, it has several million dan less harvest than others every year, and it cannot resist the invasion of natural and man-made disasters. Like the coastal areas of Xinghua, there is only one rice harvest every year. If the water conservancy can be adjusted well in the future, can't it increase a season of wheat harvest and get several million dan more grain?

Northern Jiangsu has now changed with the military situation. The land problem that was "disrupted" by the Communist army in the past now urgently needs the government to find ways to "improve," and the methods of improvement need to be dealt with carefully.

The war-torn areas within the occupied areas are full of devastation, with thousands of troubles. They cannot be compared to the "taking over" of enemy property in the recovered areas. The Communist Party's "land reform" has already "lost the hearts of the people" in Northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the government should intensify "collecting the hearts of the people" in its future handling of rural areas in Northern Jiangsu. How to collect the hearts of the people? The author believes that at least the following points should be achieved:

(1) Refer to the "Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land in Various Provinces" promulgated in the past to properly resolve all land problems.

(2) Adjust the relationship between owners and tenants so that disputes between owners and tenants can be resolved fairly.

(3) Relieve poor farmers and improve their lives so that they directly feel that the Communist Party's propaganda is a deception.

(4) Strictly prohibit the "Returning Home Corps" from reversing the account or using pressure, and all individual disputes will be resolved by the township office (or a rural committee will be established, composed of the government, owners, tenants, and impartial gentry), or lawsuits will be filed in court, and all will be handled in accordance with the law.

(5) Strictly prevent troublemakers from lurking, agitating, and disrupting order.

(6) For wasteland and public land, detailed verification and handling should be carried out. For land with owners, verify and return it. For land without owners, it cannot be allowed to be neglected and abandoned.

(7) Improve agricultural technology, relieve famine, increase production, and actively develop Northern Jiangsu by taking advantage of the current opportunity.

(8) Strengthen the self-defense forces of farmers and strictly prevent bandits from disturbing rural areas.

(9) Build highways and sanitary facilities, guide normal activities, and promote rural civilization

(10) Popularize literacy education, promote agricultural education, transform farmers' thinking, and all county and district offices should understand rural areas and pay attention to rural problems.

The above is only based on what the author has seen and cannot be considered complete. However, the author believes that dealing with the rural areas of Northern Jiangsu after the transformation is complicated and seemingly difficult, but following the rules and regulations is not too difficult. Because landlords in rural Northern Jiangsu have been constantly devastated and ravaged by the enemy puppet and Communist armies for many years, their land and economic concepts should also show their enlightenment, and the general poor people, after realizing that they have been deceived by the Communist Party, should also change their ways, cooperate with owners and tenants, and work hard to produce, and jointly help promote the Three Principles of the People's revolutionary cause. Prolonged chaos will inevitably lead to governance. This may not be the blessing of Northern Jiangsu and the country. However, district and township staff should also fully demonstrate their integrity and responsibility and devote themselves to regaining the hearts of the people.

Women and Family
Where Are Women Going?
Wen

Are women ultimately to return to the kitchen or to step into society? This remains the focal point of disputes over women's issues today, and can even be said to be the key to why women's issues are issues at all. Here, the author excerpts the opinions of world figures on this issue,勉强 as an answer.

Eleanor Roosevelt: It depends on the circumstances. No generalizations can be made, nor can any fixed path be followed.

H.G. Wells: Women were originally happy to be protected by men. Modern social conditions have changed the relationship between husband and wife, so there is no set way for the relationship between husband and wife.

: It's all about money.

: Excessive freedom for women is dangerous. A happy marriage is an economic and social association, and it must be integrated as a whole.

: Men are always happy for women to rely on them—the problem depends entirely on the degree of understanding between husband and wife.

Paul Geraldy: Women who are economically self-sufficient are even more lovable.

Violette Horeau: A good mother should work outside. Women become new women in order to be good mothers. You can have a renewed interest in children's education, better communication, and a deeper understanding between parents and children.

Childhood Experiences
Tai

(1) Theft
When I was eight years old, one day I was playing under the window when Mrs. Bai said some secret things to my mother, which I heard. After Mrs. Bai left, my mother knew that I had heard their conversation and said to me, "If Mrs. Bai forgot to take her handbag today, would we hand her handbag over to someone else?"

"Of course not," I replied.

Mother continued, "Today, Mrs. Bai left something more important than her diary. She left a conversation that could make many people unhappy. Although she forgot to take these conversations, they still belong to her, so we can't hand these conversations over to anyone else, do you understand?"

I understood. From then on, I knew that any secret that someone asked me to keep or a secret that a friend unintentionally leaked in words was his thing, and I could not give these things to another person. Now friends like to come to my house, because they can all speak freely, and even children will not reveal their secrets. That little credit should be given to my mother.

(2) The Price of Pride
When I was nine and my sister was seven, we both received the highest grades awards at school. So we thought our family was an excellent family, and we bragged about our intelligence to our classmates. When my father heard it, he called us over.

Father blew up a light balloon as big as a human head and said to us solemnly, the balloon's name is Aima, and she is a very smart person. Father then told the story of Aima's life. Every time he talked about Aima's success, he would blow the balloon a little bigger. The story became longer and longer, and Aima was blown bigger and bigger. Later, we were so scared that we avoided it from a distance. When Aima swelled to the point of bursting, Father's story suddenly stopped.

"Now you don't dare to get close to Aima anymore, right?" Father asked us, "Aima is so proud and has such a big head. When you brag about yourselves to your classmates, the classmates feel about you the same way you feel about Aima. You are so proud that no one dares to get close to you.

From then on, every time we did something worthy of pride, we would think of Aima's big head, and our conceited thoughts would disappear immediately.

(3) A Fair Method
Every time my brother and I came back from school, we always felt hungry. One day, when we came back from school, we asked our mother for something to eat. My mother put a cake in front of us, with a small knife next to it, and said to us; "Whoever of you two separates the cake first, the other one has the right to choose first."

My brother was very quick. He grabbed the knife and wanted to cut the cake into two different sizes. Suddenly, he stopped and looked at his mother and then at me, and then cut the cake into two equal sizes. He let me take it first, and then he took the remaining one.

From then on, whenever we had to divide things to eat—cakes, bread, butter—we would divide them into two equal pieces, and we learned to always respect the rights of others.

When Your Child Falls in Love
Feng

When you find that your adult or adult children seem a little absent-minded, moody, and particularly concerned about dressing up lately, you may suspect that he (she) is falling in love. Then, dear parents, don't panic, and don't ignore it. This is the time to take on your greatest and most sacred responsibility!

Many parents like to treat their children, who are burning with intense love in their hearts, with intimidation, questioning, and even scolding. The result may be failure. Because love is not an ordinary piece of clothing, its mystery, sweetness, and charm cannot be relieved by a few words from parents. On the contrary, if a young person in love does not receive correct instructions, teachings, and love, unexpected dangers and tragic endings may occur. We should admit that love is not an immoral or abnormal act, especially for young people, it is a natural desire and impulse.

First of all, you should show your children that you quite agree with or admire his (her) proper friendships or love, because a person's ability to act and social skills are mostly developed in friendship. At the same time, you can suggest to him (her) to often invite friends to chat and gather, and should have a calm and detailed observation of the other party's personality, habits, and temperaments, and must not fall blindly in love because of a momentary impulse. Perhaps he (she) in love needs to go out to play and walk from time to time, you'd better not stop him. It is futile to prohibit it even in the beginning of love or when it is at its peak, and it will damage his (her) self-esteem and cause aversion. When he

### Fertile Land Turns into a Vast Expanse of Water: Frequent Hot Weather and Rain Result in Disaster

Over 20,000 Acres of Sand Fields in Shatin Submerged

[Special Dispatch from Changsha] The strong winds and heavy rain here cleared up at 3 PM on the 27th, returning to normal. The district offices are investigating the extent of the damage. Part of the County Agricultural Extension Office's buildings was also blown down by the strong winds. All the rice paddies are several feet deep in water, and the rice ears are almost completely submerged. The experimental planting area for American vegetable seeds has become a waterlogged area. An urgent telegram was sent to the county government requesting them to send personnel to inspect and make repairs.

[Another Dispatch] The recent heavy rainstorms in this area caused water levels to rise sharply, turning low-lying areas into waterlogged lands. The sand fields in the Fourth and Seventh districts of Binjiang were formed by years of accumulated silt. After this impact, the new dikes built this year, with their unconsolidated soil, were the first to be breached and collapsed. The surging floodwaters became even more rampant, like a strong wind sweeping away fallen leaves, making rescue impossible. Up to seven sections of the embankment were destroyed. The formerly fertile land has now become a vast expanse of water, with over 20,000 acres of fields submerged. Of these fields, 90% were planted with soybeans, which were just about to mature and could have been harvested entirely. Now, they have suddenly encountered a major disaster, causing significant losses and raising concerns about people's livelihoods.

### A Scoundrel in Southern Pudong Arrested for Being a Spy for the Enemy

[Special Dispatch from Songjiang] Li Dwarf, a notorious scoundrel who roamed the Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian, and Southern Pudong areas, served as a secret agent for the traitor Xu of the puppet security team during the occupied period. Relying on his power, he extorted money. The people of Southern Pudong dared to be angry but dared not speak out. During the eight years of suffering, they all wanted to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. On the 18th of this month, Li was arrested after returning from drinking in Hujiaqiao, Fengxian. The news spread like wildfire, and people in Jinshanwei, Zhangyan, and Xinbang all applauded and cheered. Some even wrote down the scoundrel's crimes and posted them on the streets for people to see.

### Communist Spy Hiding in Suzhou Arrested and Admits to Mission

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou] The shade outside the entrance of Wen Fengrun Sauce Shop outside the Lou Gate in this city is a gathering place for vagrants. Recently, a Communist spy, Wang Fagen, suddenly mixed in with them, offering small favors and using them to gather military intelligence. A few days ago, Wang Fagen instigated Wang Ziqing and Wu Linsheng to go to Wuxi to gather military intelligence. However, upon getting off the train, they were spotted by military police stationed in Wuxi and were apprehended. After questioning Wang Ziqing, he confirmed that he had been instigated by Wang Fagen to go to Wuxi to gather military intelligence. Wu Linsheng denied it vehemently. The military police stationed in Wuxi reported the information to the Second Battalion of Military Police stationed in Suzhou, which sent personnel in disguise to investigate the address. After confirming the person's presence, Wang Fagen was arrested on the morning of the 29th. After repeated interrogation, he admitted to having a Communist mission, but he was not directly involved and had a mastermind above him. The Military Police Battalion stationed in Suzhou is currently conducting a secret investigation.

### Yang Yanbin Bedridden in Mudu

[Dispatch from Wuxi] The bandits of Bada in Pingtai Mountain, originally scheduled to be concentrated in Xukou for reorganization on the 23rd, have been postponed to the end of the month due to continuous rain and inconvenient boat travel on Taihu Lake.

### Street Peddlers Suffer Losses: Robbed on Top of Train

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou] When the 54th Shanghai-Nanjing fourth-class passenger train departed from Shanghai North Station at 1:20 AM on the 28th, due to the crowding of passengers, some street peddlers climbed onto the roof of the train with their goods. There were about seven or eight peddlers between Shanghai and Wuxi, each carrying bolts of cloth. At 4:50 AM, while it was still dark, the train stopped at Hushu Pass Station. Unexpectedly, twelve strong men, dressed in military uniforms but without unit insignia or collar badges, were lying in wait on the roof of the train. When the train was about to move, they pulled out their bayonets from their waists, cut the ropes securing the cloth, and forcibly snatched the cloth, throwing it onto the north-side platform. Seven or eight bandits quickly jumped down, each carrying bolts of cloth under their arms, and fled. Station police officers discovered this and gave chase, but the bandits escaped across the river. The peddlers suffered extremely heavy losses.

### Bandit Gangs in the Border Areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan Provinces Completely Disintegrated; Bandit Leaders Zhang Lao Si and Zeng Ying Executed

[Special Dispatch from Nanchang on the 29th] Public security in Jiangxi Province is gradually becoming more stable. Previously, during the lean season, bandit activities were frequently reported. Recently, after joint suppression by the provincial government and neighboring provinces, the banditry has subsided somewhat. The bandit gangs in southern Jiangxi and the border areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan have been completely disintegrated. Bandit leaders Zhang Lao Si and Zeng Ying have both been executed. The bandit gangs in eastern Jiangxi were led by Zhang and Zeng. With the elimination of Zhang's gang, Zeng's gang still has remnants, and they are currently being encircled and suppressed. The bandit gangs in northern Jiangxi previously had senior central government officials stationed in Guling. The provincial government deployed stronger forces to station around the outer perimeter of Mount Lu and Nanxunqian, and the bandits' power was suppressed. They then fragmented into smaller groups, appearing from time to time to loot soldiers and rob goods. The Jiangxi and Hubei authorities are planning a joint suppression. The bandits in western Jiangxi have fled into Hunan Province. If the Jiangxi forces are slightly weaker, they may return to Jiangxi to cause trouble.

### Regarding the Appropriation of Temples

According to the "Provisional Constitution" and the "Draft Constitution," monks are also citizens of the Republic of China, and they enjoy the same rights and obligations as other citizens. We should not view monks with traditional mindsets. Citizens whose rights are violated can petition the government, and monks are no exception. Why should we be surprised? Regarding the appropriation of temples, we cannot blame the monks for misunderstanding. Their rights have been violated, so it's no wonder they are angry. We need to investigate the cause of the Municipal Assembly's proposal to appropriate temples, which is for the Jade Buddha Temple. According to the monks of the Jade Buddha Temple, the District Office of the Thirteenth District is occupying the Buddhist Academy. Initially, it was borrowed for 20 days, then extended for two months, and finally became an indefinite loan. Furthermore, the District Chief's residence is also located inside the temple. The Municipal Assembly is a legislative body, and its target is the people. Honorable councilors, please think again. – (Sun Dayun)

### The Wishes of a School-Dropping Apprentice

Dear Editor, I was a student at Beihang Street Elementary School in Tongxiang County. I had to drop out of school after the enemy invaded. With the high cost of living, my father could not afford to send me to school. After a year, I was sent to work in society. I encountered a despotic shop owner who didn't even allow me to read Shen Bao or write letters home during my free time. So, after five years, my knowledge is still as poor as when I first dropped out of school. Now that I am of age, my future is bleak. Seeing the large number of school dropouts in society, I suggest that kind gentlemen in society establish a night school self-study course or reading room for school-dropping apprentices so that young workers can receive some intellectual enlightenment in their spare time!

### Nuremberg Tribunal to Announce Verdict: Nazi War Criminals to be Sentenced Today; At Least Thirteen to be Sentenced to Death; Four Out of Seven Organizations Found Not Guilty

[News Agency Report] Paris, 30th (Broadcast from Nuremberg): The severity of the crimes committed by the 21 major Nazi war criminals varies, and the sentences they deserve will be announced together tomorrow. At that time, the President of the International Military Tribunal, Lord Lawrence of Britain, will announce them alone. Each defendant will enter the courtroom individually to hear the verdict.

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 30th] The 21 German war criminals will be sentenced today. Nuremberg is under tight security, as if facing a major enemy. Armored vehicles and light tanks pass through the medieval streets, the rumbling of wheels breaking the silence of the ancient world, filling the air with tension. The Nazi Party movement originated here, and the fate of the Nazi leaders will also be buried here forever. The Germans are saddened by this sight. The International Tribunal will hold its final session today. Security is even tighter, with military police everywhere. Police are searching pedestrians and vehicles on the streets. Outsiders will not be allowed to enter the courtroom to listen to the verdict unless they have a special admission pass. They can only listen to the reading of the verdict from loudspeakers. Each criminal will be sentenced separately and will be allowed to request clemency from the Four-Power Control Council for Germany in Berlin.

[News Agency Report] London, 30th (Broadcast): The International Military Tribunal, which is trying the Nazi war criminals, began today to read the tens of thousands of words of the judgment through its President, Sir Lawrence of Britain. The judgment found the Nazi regime guilty and pointed out that the war crimes committed by the regime were unprecedented in history. The crimes committed by the war criminals were the systematic implementation of violence and terror against the invaded people of Europe. However, the court ruled that the German High Command, the General Staff, the German Cabinet, and the Sturmabteilung were not criminal organizations. The Schutzstaffel, the Sicherheitsdienst, and the Secret Police were found to be criminal organizations. The court stated that after the purge movement in 1934, the Sturmabteilung became "relatively unimportant." Although some members of the Sturmabteilung participated in war crimes and inhumane acts, it should not be immediately assumed that all its members participated in or were aware of criminal acts. According to the most experienced observers, at least thirteen of the 21 major Nazi war criminals will be sentenced to death. It is believed that Schacht, Dönitz, and others may be spared the death penalty, while Hess may receive special treatment.

A Glimpse of the Contents of the Judgment

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 30th] The International War Crimes Tribunal convened this morning at 10:00 AM (5:04 PM Shanghai time), and President Judge Lawrence read the judgment. The first defendant to enter the courtroom was Schirach, followed by Ley, Nazi Youth Movement leader Schirach, Jewish executioner Streicher, financial leader Funk, and Schacht, followed by Rosenberg, Frick, Neurath, Frick, Göring, Hess, and Ribbentrop. President Lawrence first briefly described the agreement and regulations made by the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, on August 6, 1943, and explained the composition, jurisdiction, and tasks of the court. He then discussed the process of the trial, such as the date and circumstances of the 403 hearings that had been held. He then discussed the issue of aggressive war and the laws related to the issue, pointing out that the court was bound by the four-country agreement. The regulation was the result of the legal exercise of sovereign legislative powers by the countries accepting Germany's surrender. After studying the Nazi Party's plan, the court found that the German people's desire for unification within the German borders was largely related to the actions that caused the invasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia. The abolition of the Treaty of Versailles was an important motive for attempting to prove that the German government's policies were reasonable. The demand for land was an excuse to acquire living space at the expense of other countries. The expulsion of Jews from outside the German race was a direct cause of the persecution of the Jewish people. The demand for the establishment of national armed forces resulted in the largest scale of rearmament.

President Lawrence continued, "What the defendants are entitled to is a fair trial based on legal principles and facts." The main reasons for the defendants' pleas were: "At the time of the so-called criminal acts, no country had launched an aggressive war, and there was no legal definition of aggressive war, no explicit provision for punishment, and no special court had been established before to try and punish such criminals. Therefore, punishing the criminals of aggressive war is a post-facto law, which is contrary to the legal principles of civilized countries." President Lawrence said that the arson of the German Reichstag was an excuse used by Hitler and his cabinet to suspend the provisions of the constitution that guaranteed freedom. Actions such as destroying other political parties, using concentration camps, establishing secret police and the Sicherheitsdienst to eliminate political enemies, and reducing the powers of local governments were all aimed at enabling the German government to monopolize political power.

[News Agency Report] Paris, 30th (Broadcast from Nuremberg): Soviet Chief Judge Nikitchenko continued to announce the part related to the massacre of Jews, saying that most of the 90,000 people killed by the Nazis in one year were Jews. Based on the Nazi doctrine that no Jew should be of German blood, the Jews suffered this tragic fate. From 1938, almost all Jews were expelled from German society. The court then began to announce the part about the crimes of the seven important Nazi organizations: (1) the Nazi Party leadership, (2) the Gestapo, (3) the Sicherheitsdienst, (4) the Sturmabteilung, (5) the Schutzstaffel, (6) the Cabinet, and (7) the High Command and the Supreme Headquarters. All four occupation zones are treating them fairly in accordance with the anti-Nazi legal concepts.

[Taibao News] Paris, 30th (Broadcast from Nuremberg): The Nuremberg Tribunal convened this afternoon to announce the verdict. Judge Dieter announced the part about the evidence, saying that there was overwhelming evidence of war crimes that violated humanity. The court specifically cited the order issued by the Gestapo in March 1944 by Kehrl to execute fugitive prisoners of war. The Nazi thugs inflicted even more brutal acts on Soviet prisoners of war, saying that the Germans established organized killing centers. Before the invasion of the Soviet territory, they formed special executioner groups. In one area of southern Soviet Union alone, one of these executioner groups solved the lives of 90,000 men, women, and children, which was at the beginning of the war. There was also a lot of evidence regarding economic plunder and looting of works of art.

U.S. Assistant Judge Parker declared that Hitler had conscripted 25 million people in various countries to work for Germany, and the number of people indirectly benefiting the Nazi war economy totaled 35 million. Sokol said that of the 5 million people working in Germany, fewer than 200,000 were volunteers, and the circumstances of these workers were particularly inhumane.

It was also learned that Hess asked to leave the defendant's dock at 3:00 PM due to a stomachache.

The reason part of the court's judgment held that Schacht and Papen had not participated in the criminal plan, so the charges against them could be reduced. The court held that the opinion of the 22 defendants that they had foreseen the collective plan of "war crimes" or "crimes against humanity" could not be adopted.

### Various Aspects of War Criminals in Prison: Nazi Soldiers Regard Death as a Return Home; Ribbentrop is the Most Cowardly; Hess Spends All Day Studying Numerology

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 29th] The International War Crimes Tribunal held its last secret meeting today before announcing the verdict. In the prison where the war criminals lived, the guards and military police had been increased to a battalion and a company, totaling about 1,000 officers and soldiers. An official said that these guards and military police were closely monitoring the war criminals and protecting them from unapproved guests. At the same time, they were also strictly ensuring the safety of President Lawrence. Christian and Catholic clergymen today prayed for the defendants. Near the court, there was a heavily guarded house with about 50 court officials, including clerks, who were preparing the judgment. This secretarial work was performed by volunteers who had been approved. Before the verdict was announced, they were completely isolated from the outside world. At least two of the defendants had expressed their welcome to being sentenced to death. One was the Jewish executioner Streicher, who told a prison guard, "I am willing to die. At least I can close my eyes in peace and no longer have the guards outside disturbing my dreams all night." Funk, Hitler's economic advisor, also said, "Death is better than living in sin today." The superstitious Hess spent all day studying numerology in his room and issued a prediction, saying, "A miracle will surely appear when the verdict is announced." Since the trial began, Hess has been the most optimistic. Only one week after the trial began, he told a psychologist, "Death is unavoidable, but Nazi justice will never die with the death of the 20 leaders." Göring, Keitel, Jodl, Dönitz, Raeder, and others, who styled themselves as soldiers, all expressed that they regarded death as a return home. Except for Jodl and Raeder, all of them had asked their lawyers to apply to the Allied Control Council that if they were sentenced to death, they would request to be executed by firing squad. Nazi banker Schacht still claimed that the court had no right to sentence him, while Neurath was confident that he would receive a prison sentence. Ribbentrop was the most cowardly and dared not talk about the verdict.

### Diplomatic Contacts Underway in Paris; Britain and the United States Decide to Support Turkey; Soviets Building Fortifications on the Turkish Border

[News Agency Report] Paris, 30th (Broadcast from Istanbul): According to the "Tasvir" newspaper, the Soviet Union is building combat fortifications five kilometers deep along the Turkish border. Men and women over the age of 40 have been called to participate in the work. Heavy artillery, various types of launchers, and anti-aircraft artillery teams are deployed along the line, and exercises are held from time to time.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Responsible diplomatic officials here said today that Britain and the United States are expected to quickly discuss the Dardanelles issue and once again support Turkey. This is the most important development in international disputes since Stalin's statement on the 14th of this month, but there are no significant signs that relations between the major powers have worsened. Secretary of State Byrnes has exchanged preliminary views with British Foreign Secretary Bevin in Paris. It is known here that Britain and the United States will firmly oppose the Soviet Union's expansion of military power in the Dardanelles and oppose direct negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. U.S. officials believe that this new direct negotiation between the Soviet Union and Turkey is tantamount to letting Turkey be at the mercy of the Soviet Union without the opportunity to resist the Soviet Union's demands.
